Then, gently work the milk or cream into your hair, running your fingers between the strands. Try to focus on the ends and outer portion of your hair, where it is driest and less on the roots. When choosing a smoothing hair milk or cream, look for something that does not contain sulfates and silicones. Silicones are plastics that can only be washed out with sulfates, which are harsh, drying, and damaging cleaning agents."

Some people's hair requires a higher concentration of vinegar, while others need more water in their solution. Use caution if you have color-treated hair, as the vinegar rinse may take the color out.

        "Try to re-sculpt your curls by winding your locks around your finger, and gently letting go.",
        "The tightness of your curls and the width of the teeth on your comb heavily impact whether or not combing your hair will create frizz and breakage.",
        "Style your hair to hide the frizz.",
        "Sometimes, curly hair is just plain stubborn and there is little you can do while out on the run.",
        "If you don't have time for a shower, and if your hair simply won't behave, pull it back into a ponytail, a braid, or some other hair style.",

        "If you have shorter hair, consider clipping parts of it back, or even tying a chic bandana around your head.",
        "Using Long-Term Fixes Consider using hair masks, oils, and other long-term fixes.",
        "Sometimes, you will need to invest a little more time in taming your curly hair.",

        "This section will give you some basic recipes for masks and oils that may leave your hair feeling soft and shiny.",
        "Keep in mind that everyone's curls are a little different, and that what works for your friend's curls may not work for yours.",
        "If one method does not work, do not despair: take a deep breath and try something else.",
        "Use coconut oil as a hair mask or leave-in conditioner.",
        "Coconut oil not only smells delicious, but it is also incredibly good for your hair.",
        "It not only keeps the frizz at bay, but it also stimulates hair growth and reintroduces moisture and shine into your hair.",
        "You can either use it as a hair mask or as a leave-in conditioner.",
        "To use it as a leave-in conditioner, scoop out a small pea-sized amount of coconut oil and rub it between your palms to warm it up.",

        "Place a shower cap over your hair and let the mask sit for 30 minutes.",
        "You can dampen your hair prior to the treatment using a spray bottle containing conditioner diluted with water first.",

        "Make a simpler mask using just olive oil.",

        "Place a shower cap over your hair.",
        "Leave the mask in your hair for 20 minutes, then wash it out using shampoo and conditioner.",
        "Use a vinegar rinse.",
        "Vinegar may smell pungent, but when diluted with water, it can make your hair appear soft and shiny.",
        "It not only restores the natural pH of your hair, but also removes any soap residue.",
        "Dilute 1/3 cup (75 milliliters) of vinegar in 1 quart (1 liter) of cool water, and pour it over your hair at the end of your shower.",
        "The cool water will close the hair cuticles, making your hair look softer and shinier.",
        "Follow up with a regular shampoo and conditioner to remove the vinegar smell from your hair.",
        "Use this rinse once or twice a month.",
        "You can use apple cider vinegar or distilled white vinegar.",
        "Play around with the proportions.",
        "Some people's hair requires a higher concentration of vinegar, while others need more water in their solution.",
        "Use caution if you have color-treated hair, as the vinegar rinse may take the color out.",
        "Consider adding herbs to your vinegar.",
        "Simply boil the herbs in the water first, then strain the herbs out using a sieve.",
        "Let the water cool, then add the vinegar.",

        "Lavender and lemon verbena will add fragrance to your rinse while calendula will help condition your hair further.",
        "Make an all-in-one solution.",
        "You can easily make a hair smoothing solution using some shampoo, conditioner, and hair oil.",
        "You can do this by mixing one part shampoo, one part conditioner, and one part hair gel.",
        "Place everything into an empty bottle, and shake it vigorously to combine the contents.",
        "Use this solution as you would any shampoo and be sure to rinse your hair out afterwards.",
        "You can also use a small amount of this solution as a sort of leave-in conditioner.",
        "You can dilute a small amount of this solution with water and use a spray bottle to dampen your hair.",
        "Consider getting a trim.",
        "If your hair continues being unruly, consider going to an experienced stylist you trust and having him or her trim your hair.",
        "He or she will trim off the split, damaged ends, which are partly-responsible for frizz.",
        "If you are choosing a new stylist, make sure that he or she knows how to trim or cut curly hair.",
        "Knowing What to Do and Avoid Resist the urge to touch your hair.",
        "Curly hair may be fun to play with, but touching it too much disrupts the shape of the curl, leading to frizz.",
        "Use a wide-toothed comb, not a brush.",
        "Curly hair becomes frizzy when brushed.",
        "If your hair becomes tangled, you can start untangling it with your fingers and then finish with a wide-toothed comb, or use a wide-toothed comb the whole time.",
        "Comb your hair properly.",
        "Improper brushing leads to frizzy hair, and frizzy hair leads to frustration and distress.",
        "The direction in which your comb your hair as well as whether or not your hair is wet will make a difference.",
        "Here are some tips for combing your curls properly:\nDo not comb your hair from the roots down.",
        "Instead, start combing your hair in small sections, starting from the ends and working your way up to the roots.",
        "Combing your hair from the roots down puts a lot of stress on your curls, creating snags, tangles, and breakage.",
        "Avoid combing your hair if it is dry.",
        "Instead, work on soaking-wet hair, and use a wide-toothed comb or your fingers.",
        "Apply some conditioner or detangler into your curls, and gently detangle them by running your comb or fingers through them.",
        "Be sure to start from the roots first.",
        "If you must brush your hair when it is dry, do so using a wet, wide-toothed comb or wet fingers.",
        "Shape your curls.",
        "When your hair is still wet, you will notice that it may still retain some of its shape.",
        "Find those curls and wrap the hair strands around your finger, gently reshaping them.",
        "This method is known as finger coiling or curling.",
        "Don't wash your hair daily.",
        "It may sound unsanitary, but washing your hair every day strips it of its natural oils.",
        "This leaves your hair feeling brittle and dry.",
        "If you have tight curls, you may only need to wash your hair once a week.",
        "If you find that you need to wash your hair about 2 times a week, you can also use a dry shampoo in between days to keep your hair looking fresh.",
        "Moisturize your hair with the right shampoo and conditioner.",
        "Part of the reason why your hair appears frizzy, unruly, and untamed might be because it is too dry.",
        "When buying your next bottle of shampoo and conditioner, look for something that says \"Moisturizing.\"",
        "Consider buying shampoo and conditioner specifically designed for curly hair.",
        "These shampoos and conditioners are not only moisturizing, but also gentle on your hair, preventing it from further damage.",
        "Look for labels that say \"For Curly Hair,\" or something similar.",
        "Consider deep conditioning once a week.",
        "Curly hair tends to get dry more easily than other types.",
        "A deep conditioner, however, will help replenish any lost moisture, leaving your hair feeling soft and luxurious.",
        "Most deep conditioners need to be applied right after your shower and left on for about 5 to 20 minutes, but refer to the directions on the container for more specific times.",
        "Be sure to tuck your hair under a shower cap while you are waiting for the deep conditioner to do its work.",
        "The cap will keep the warmth and moisture in, making the conditioner even more effective.",
        "Sit under a heated hair dryer while wearing the cap to condition even more.",
        "Avoid shampoos, conditioners, and hair products containing sulfates, silicones, and parabens.",
        "Sulfates are cleaning agents that tend to be especially harsh on naturally curly hair.",
        "They can strip your hair of its natural oils and moisture, making it dry and brittle.",
        "Silicones are plastics that help add shine to your hair, but can only be removed using the damaging sulfates; therefore, you must avoid using both.",
        "Parabens on the other hand are preservatives that may cause cancer.",
        "Avoid heat styling when possible.",
        "This means no hair straighteners, no curling irons, and no hair driers.",
        "Instead, allow your hair to dry on its own.",
        "If you must use a hair drier, then use a cool setting and a diffuser.",
        "This makes the heat less intense and helps distribute it evenly throughout your hair.",
        "It also won't disrupt the curls.",
        "If you must use hair straighteners and curling irons, then be sure to protect your hair by misting it with a heat protecting spray.",
        "Toss out the towel and use an old T-shirt instead.",
        "Towels may feel soft against your skin, but they are anything but soft when it comes to curly hair.",
        "The fibers on your towel tug and pull on your hair and cause friction, which in turn creates frizz.",
        "Dry your hair using an old, clean T-shirt instead."
