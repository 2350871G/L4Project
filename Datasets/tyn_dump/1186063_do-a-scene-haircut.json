Before you cut, plan where you would like the layers of your hairstyle to line up. To get ideas of cut and color, you may wish to look at pictures online to see which sort of style you prefer. Websites like Tumblr are particularly good sources for images of the scene hairstyle. Consider your personal preferences but also consider what lengths will emphasize your best features. If you face is too round, for example, you may wish to have the upper layers end around your jawline, to make your face appear more narrow. Your jaw, chin, shoulders, and collarbone make good points of reference for your cut. Feel free to infuse your own creativity in how you approach the kind of cut you want. Implement different aspects of different haircuts to create your scene haircut."

        "Fringe: the trademark side-swept bangs common for scene haircuts.",

        "Choosing Color Options Bleach your hair.",
        "This is optional, but as we talk about colors, is an important suggestion to offer.",
        "Bleaching the hair provides a clean slate for colors and dyes to show up in their brightest hues possible.",
        "This should of course be done by a professional if possible to decrease likelihood of hair damage.",

        "Colorful extensions can be purchased and placed to give your a hair a multicolored look.",
