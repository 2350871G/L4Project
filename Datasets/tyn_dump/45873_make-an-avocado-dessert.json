Put 2 pounds (0.91 kg) ripe avocados on a cutting board and carefully cut lengthwise through both sides of each avocado. Use your hands to twist the sides of the avocado apart. Then, use a spoon to remove the pits and scoop the flesh from each 1/2 into a food processor. There's no need to cut the avocados into chunks since you'll be blending them. Add milk, cocoa, vanilla, and salt to the food processor. Pour \u20444 cup (59 ml) of plain, chocolate, or non-dairy milk into the food processor. Then, add 3 tablespoons of (21 g) of unsweetened cocoa powder, 2 teaspoons (9.9 ml) of vanilla extract or vanilla bean paste, and 1/4 teaspoon (1 g) of salt. For example, use almond milk, soy milk, oat milk, or hemp milk. If you'd like your pudding to have a stronger chocolate flavor, add an extra 2 tablespoons (14 g) of cocoa powder. Blend the ingredients for 30 to 45 seconds. Turn on the food processor and blend the ingredients until the avocados are completely smooth. You might have to stop the machine and scrape down the sides if bits of avocado are getting stuck. Set aside the avocado mixture while you prepare the chocolate. Chop 2 to 3 ounces (30 to 45 g) of chocolate into \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) pieces. Put dark or bittersweet chocolate with at least 70% cocoa solids on your cutting board. Then, use a large knife to carefully cut the chocolate into \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) chunks. It's important to use a dark or bittersweet chocolate so your pudding has a rich flavor.
