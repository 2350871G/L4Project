Feel free to use a white dress or skirt if you prefer. If your white base garments have visible logos, don\u2019t worry! Plan to cut out spots large enough to cover these up."

Using a white or yellow wax marking pencil, draw large- to medium-sized organic blob-shapes onto the felt. Felt works best because it is easy to attach to clothing and it won\u2019t unravel when you cut it, but you can use scrap fabric or fake fur if you prefer. Look at pictures of Holstein cows for reference on spot shape and scale. Feel free to give your cow brown spots instead. Or, if you\u2019re creating a fantasy cow, go wild with color! For example, you could add purple spots to a light blue background. It works best when the spots are much lighter or much darker than the background."

If you\u2019d rather remove the spots from your clothes later, safety pin the spots around the edges instead of using spray adhesive.
