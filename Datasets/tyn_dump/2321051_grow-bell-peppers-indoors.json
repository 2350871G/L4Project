The hole should be about 1/4 inch (2/3 cm) deep. Bury the seeds. Drop one seed into each hole and loosely cover it with additional soil. Place the seed tray in a warm location. Sweet bell peppers germinate best when the soil temperature is at 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius) or higher. If possible, sit the seedling tray on top of a seedling heat mat. Otherwise, place it on a warm, sunny windowsill. Keep the seeds moist. Once the surface of the soil becomes dry, spray it down with water. Do not drench the soil, but do not allow it to dry out. Transplanting Transplant the seedlings once they have two sets of true leaves. \"True leaves\" refer to fully grown leaves, rather than leaves that are just beginning to grow. Use a large enough pot. If you plan on keeping each pepper plant separate, a 2-inch or 4-inch (5-cm or 10-cm) pot should suffice. You can also combine multiple pepper plants into a single pot if it is larger. Fill the pots with soil. Use a loose, well-draining soil, preferably one with a high content of organic matter. Dig a small hole in the dirt.

Gently \"wiggle\" or pry it from the seedling tray by squeezing on the sides of the plastic compartment. Once the seedling has been removed, roots, soil, and all, place it in the hole.
