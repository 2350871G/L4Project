If you are installing the direct wire strain relief, go on to steps 4 and 5. Remove the screws from the strain relief (lower section). Put two clamp section tabs into the hole below the terminal block opening with one tab pointing up and the other pointing down. Secure the tabs with one hand and tighten the strain relief screws so the clamp sections are held together. Insert the power supply cord into the strain relief. It should lie horizontal, as shown, and fit snugly enough so as to stay in by itself--do not tighten the screws around the cord. Now go on to step 6. Remove the conduit connector and screws from the strain relief (lower section). Put the threaded portion of the strain relief through the hole below the terminal block opening. Screw the conduit connector onto the strain relief threads. Insert the direct wire cable into the strain relief. It should lie horizontal, as shown, and fit snugly enough so as to stay in by itself. Tighten the strain relief screw directly against the wire cable, as shown. Now go on to step 6. Choose your electrical connection type.For the power supply cord you can use a 4-wire receptacle OR a 3-wire receptacle--follow steps 7-10 for the 4-wire receptacle OR follow steps 11-13 for the 3-wire receptacle.
