How many oranges you end up using depends on your final design and how long you want the final garland to be. Plan on using about 11 oranges for a 4-foot (1.22-meter) garland. Bake the oranges in the oven for 4 hours, turning them every hour. You can place them directly onto the rack in the oven. Avoid using a baking sheet, as this will trap too much moisture and will prevent the orange slices from drying out properly. Every hour, use a pair of tongs to turn the orange slices. If you'd rather not dirty up your oven, place a metal rack on top of a baking sheet, then place the orange slices on the rack. Buy a big bag of bay leaves and empty it into a large bowl. Again, how many bay leaves you end up using will depend on how long your garland is, and how you choose to arrange the oranges, bay leaves, and cinnamon sticks on it. You will need about 250 bay leaves for a 4-foot (1.22-meter) garland. It might be a good idea to go through the bay leaves first and pluck out any damaged or broken ones. Save those for cooking.

Cut a 4-foot (1.22-meter) garland piece of twine, thread it through a yarn needle, and tie one end into a small loop. The loop does not have to be very big; something big enough for your finger to slip though will be plenty. The loop will help prevent everything from sliding off.

Remember to leave a few inches/centimeters at the end of your twine. Tie another loop at the end of the twine. At this point, you can hang your garland from hooks or nails in doorways, above fireplace mantles, or over windows. You can also wrap them around your Christmas tree! Making a Salt Dough Garland Preheat your oven to 285\u00b0F (140\u00b0C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Mix together the dry ingredients. Pour 1 cup (100 grams) of all-purpose flour into a large mixing bowl, then add \u00bd cup (150 grams) of salt.

Try to get the dough to be about \u00bc-inch (0.64 centimeters) thick. Cut the dough into shapes using cookie cutters. Hearts and stars are very popular, but you can also use circles, leaves, or other shapes. Poke two holes into the center of each ornament. Use a straw or knitting needle to punch the holes; keep them about \u00bd to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) apart from each other.
