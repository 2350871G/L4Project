If you are using a flower with thorns on the stems like roses, carefully remove the thorns with either the blade of the scissors or vegetable knife. The thorns can pierce other stems and flowers causing them to wilt. If any of the bottom flowers are looking wilted or tired, pinch them off with your fingers."
