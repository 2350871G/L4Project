This will give you the chance to talk, catch up on news and simply be together. Ask your parents if it's okay to have sleepovers at each other's places. Sleepovers are lots of fun for good friends. Go to the mall together, even if you're just window shopping and having a milkshake. Share fun activities. For example, visit the pool, go to the beach or go to the movies."

You don't need to see eye to eye on everything. If you have different tastes in things, that's fine, be accepting of each other's differences. If you think your BFF has written something mean or unfriendly, always ask. It is very easy to mistakenly assume that things written mean something that they don't.

If you hear someone putting down your BFF, stick up for her and tell that person to stop spreading rumor and gossip."
