Blanching and Freezing Boil a pot of water and separate the Brussels sprouts by size. Divide your Brussels sprouts into 3 piles: a small Brussels sprouts pile, a medium pile, and a large pile. Each pile needs to be blanched for a different amount of time. If all of the Brussels sprouts are the same size, just make one big pile. Prepare a large bowl of ice water. You\u2019ll transfer the Brussels sprouts to the ice water right after you boil them to complete the blanching process. Fill the bowl three-quarters of the way full and put in about one ice cube tray of ice. Boil your small Brussels sprouts for 3 minutes. Once the pot of water you put on the stovetop is boiling, carefully drop the pile of small Brussels sprouts into it. Leave the pot uncovered and set a timer for 3 minutes. Transfer the small Brussels sprouts from the boiling water to the bowl of ice. Use a ladle to carefully scoop the Brussels sprouts out of the boiling water.
