Toothpaste is just abrasive enough to wear down scratched areas to a smoother surface. Small scratches and scuff marks are much easier to repair than deep gouges. Some CD repair services can repair the disc with a special buffing machine, but these are hard to use without causing damage."

Always rub directly from the center to the edge, never in small, circular motions or along the circular pathways. Only wash the reflective side of the disc. If the CD is very dusty, gently spray it with canned air first. If the CD is visibly greasy, use rubbing alcohol or a CD cleaning solution instead of water."
