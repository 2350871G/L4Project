For example, have pitchers throw to batters on a field with a full team behind the pitcher ready to make a play.

Managers or coaches may instruct their players to bunt, hit-and-run, steal, pitch-out or any of various other maneuvers. Accordingly, the coach will go through a series of movements (such as touching different parts of their uniforms) to indicate what they want their players to do during the next play without letting the opposing team know ahead of time. Generally, a coach will employ an \"indicator\" signal to alert their players that the next movement he makes is the signal to obey (as opposed to any earlier movements that can be ignored). The batter and any base-runners may respond with signals of their own to acknowledge receipt of the instructions. Signals, when done right, will usually give the hitting team an advantage over the team in the field."

Other pre-game tasks include filling out the line-up card so everyone will know where they'll play in the field and where they'll hit in the batting order.
