You do not need to press over all the open area, as pressing along the edges will create the embossing. With the embossing stylus pen, trace the edges of the shape that are lit by the lightbox. The fine point of the stylus is ideal for small areas, while the larger side is great for large areas. Using the embossing tool to trace around the stencil\u2019s edges will cause the paper to stretch and subsequently achieve the raised, embossed effect."

Claire Donovan-BlackwoodCrafting Expert, Heart Handmade UK Place the cardstock on top of the stencil. The light from the lightbox will shine through the stencil so that you are able to trace around it with ease.

Embossing Paper with an Embossing Machine Set up your work station. You will need an embossing machine, an embossing folder, and a piece of cardstock or watercolor paper with measurements of 4 \u00bc\u201d x 5 \u00bd\u201d so that it fits the embossing folder. Emboss your card with the embossing machine. Place the embossing folder at the entrance of the embossing machine and crank it through the machine. The roller applies pressure to the paper or cardstock, which creates raised areas onto the paper from the embossing folder. Get your cardstock situated. Place your card face side down over the stencil. Check to make sure you have both the stencil and the card aligned as you desire.
