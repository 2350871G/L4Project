If there is a great deal of confetti, try using a rubber broom or a clean rake to collect a lot in a pile and hand transfer to a garbage bag first, to spare the vacuum cleaner from overload. A handheld vacuum works best for this as it can get into smaller spaces (such as tight corners), which saves you some effort later. It also allows for quick emptying and refilling, saving your large vacuum cleaner from getting clogged. Use the narrow nozzle to get under chairs, behind furniture, etc. Empty the vacuum cleaner regularly. This will help prevent clogging and improves suction."
