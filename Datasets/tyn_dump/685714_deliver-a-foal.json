                    "description": "The mare will need plenty of room to have her foal so pick a large stall if you are going to stable her during this period. If you prefer, a mare has no problem having a foal outside in a grassy area away from the stable, but having her in the stable does allow you to provide supervision for the birth more easily. With an outdoor area, make sure it's grassy and fenced in so you can get to your mare if you need to. Keep the mare separate from other horses so it isn\u2019t stressed during birth."

Leave the solution on the floor to dry. For a disinfecting solution, you can use a bleaching solution that's at least 10% bleach. Cleaning a clay or dirt floor is more difficult than other types of floors. Sweep the stall out and clean it as well as you can. You also can't clean an outdoor area, but the grass should provide a somewhat clean area for a mare to have a baby. Clean manure out of the paddock daily to keep it clean and clear."

Don't use shavings for bedding, as the foal will be covered in moisture and the shavings may adhere to it. A foal can also inhale shavings, preventing it from breathing."

                    "description": "Horses are fairly hearty, but if you live in an area that stays cold well into spring, it's a good idea to provide heat for the stable. Check the cord for fraying and make sure to put it where the horse can't get to it. Hang the lamp high enough so it doesn\u2019t burn your foal or become a fire hazard. You really only need to do this if temperatures are below freezing, and even then, it may not be necessary. However, your mare should be inside to give birth when the temperatures outside are freezing or below."

It will warn you if she's going into labor so that you can go out to provide supervision. Some of these systems are actually attached to the horse, and they set off an alarm when the horse goes into labor. With these alarms, though, your vet will need to suture it to the horse's vulva area to set off the alarm when the mare is giving birth."

Practice loading your mare into the trailer in the months leading up to the foal\u2019s birth. This will help make the mare more comfortable if you need to haul it.

Look for at teats several weeks ahead of delivery so you'll notice when they swell. The gestation period for a horse is 335 to 345 days, so if you're timing the pregnancy, that should give you some idea of when to watch for labor.

That protects both the mare and the foal from being contaminated. You can do this in the day or so before you suspect the mare will give birth.

Directly under the tail will be the anus and just below that will be the vulva, which will look like a long slit. Wear gloves while rinsing off the horse.

She may also start sweating and urinate frequently. The symptoms may appear similar to colic. This first stage may only be a few minutes, but it can last as long as a couple of hours.

If tilting doesn't clear the nose, you can use a suction bulb to pull out mucus. If the foal is having trouble breathing use a towel to rub its abdomen and ribs, which may help it start breathing. If it's still having trouble, you can hold the foal upside down for a moment or two to let the fluid drain. Start artificial respiration if the foal doesn't breathe on its own by cupping your hands firmly over its mouth and nose. Breathe into one nostril steadily and gently, letting its chest rise and fall, then push air into the nostril again. Keep going until it can breathe on its own. Do not try to cut the cord.

        "For a disinfecting solution, you can use a bleaching solution that's at least 10% bleach.",
        "Cleaning a clay or dirt floor is more difficult than other types of floors.",
        "Sweep the stall out and clean it as well as you can.",
        "You also can't clean an outdoor area, but the grass should provide a somewhat clean area for a mare to have a baby.",
        "Clean manure out of the paddock daily to keep it clean and clear.",
        "Lay clean bedding of straw down on the floor.",
        "The straw will provide an area for the mare to lay down in, as well as a safe landing place for the foal.",
        "Don't use shavings for bedding, as the foal will be covered in moisture and the shavings may adhere to it.",
        "A foal can also inhale shavings, preventing it from breathing.",
        "Provide a heat lamp if you live in a very cold area.",
        "Horses are fairly hearty, but if you live in an area that stays cold well into spring, it's a good idea to provide heat for the stable.",
        "Check the cord for fraying and make sure to put it where the horse can't get to it.",
        "Hang the lamp high enough so it doesn\u2019t burn your foal or become a fire hazard.",
        "You really only need to do this if temperatures are below freezing, and even then, it may not be necessary.",
        "However, your mare should be inside to give birth when the temperatures outside are freezing or below.",
        "Add a video or foal alarm if you'd like to monitor your mare at a distance.",
        "Mares often go into labor at night, so a monitoring system lets you keep an eye on her.",
        "It will warn you if she's going into labor so that you can go out to provide supervision.",
        "Some of these systems are actually attached to the horse, and they set off an alarm when the horse goes into labor.",
        "With these alarms, though, your vet will need to suture it to the horse's vulva area to set off the alarm when the mare is giving birth.",
        "Make plans for how you'll haul the horse if you need to.",
        "If something goes wrong, you may need to take your horse into a vet hospital.",
        "If that's the case, you need to know who you'll call and how you'll get the horse there.",
        "Have the numbers written down and ready to go.",
        "Practice loading your mare into the trailer in the months leading up to the foal\u2019s birth.",
        "This will help make the mare more comfortable if you need to haul it.",
        "If you can't haul the horse yourself, make arrangements with someone you know who has a rig to haul your horse.",
        "Have their number on hand.",
        "Call a few days ahead to make sure the hospital will be open and ready.",
        "Helping the Mare in the First Stage of Labor Watch for the early symptoms of labor.",
        "The mare will start producing milk as early as 6 weeks before going into labor.",
        "In the week leading up to labor, you may see the tailhead lift up, as the vulva and croup muscles relax, and the teats will swell.",
        "Look for at teats several weeks ahead of delivery so you'll notice when they swell.",
        "The gestation period for a horse is 335 to 345 days, so if you're timing the pregnancy, that should give you some idea of when to watch for labor.",
        "Mares develop a waxy substance on the tip of the teat days or hours before the foal is born.",
        "IF you notice the wax, your mare is close to having the foal.",
        "Wrap the mare's tail with a tail bandage.",
        "The tail can introduce bacteria during the birth, and using a tail bandage covers up the tail.",
        "Essentially, you wet the tail down and wrap a bandage around starting from the top of the tail like you would someone's ankle.",
        "You keep wrapping and then tuck the end of the bandage into itself.",
        "That protects both the mare and the foal from being contaminated.",
        "You can do this in the day or so before you suspect the mare will give birth.",
        "Make sure the wrap isn\u2019t too tight at the base of the tail or else you could kill the horse\u2019s skin there.",
        "Wash the horse's rear end and vulva with soap and water.",
        "Doing so will help reduce bacteria in the area.",
        "Use a mild soap and gently rub it into the udder, hindquarters, and vulva area of the horse.",
        "Rinse thoroughly to get rid of the soap.",
        "The vulva is the outside part of your horse's reproductive system.",
        "To find it, look under the tail.",
        "Directly under the tail will be the anus and just below that will be the vulva, which will look like a long slit.",
        "Wear gloves while rinsing off the horse.",
        "Work from the vulva outwards so you don\u2019t drag dirt or bacteria near it.",
        "Diluted betadine solution and cotton gauze work the best for cleaning.",
        "Notice when the mare becomes restless.",
        "This behavior often means the mare is in the first stage of labor.",
        "She may move around a lot, lay down and get up again, and raise her hooves at her tummy.",
        "She may also start sweating and urinate frequently.",
        "The symptoms may appear similar to colic.",
        "This first stage may only be a few minutes, but it can last as long as a couple of hours.",
        "Give the mare space and watch it from a distance away so it doesn\u2019t get frightened during birth.",
        "Observing the Labor Take notes and use a stopwatch.",
        "When your adrenaline is pumping, you aren't as good at judging time.",
        "With a stopwatch, you can accurately time the progression of labor, which you may need to know later for your vet if something goes wrong.",
        "Taking notes ensures you remember everything that happened instead of relying on memory and is useful information to tell a veterinarian.",
        "Typically, the horse will be laying down on its side during this portion, though she might also roll around or stand up and lay back down.",
        "Watch for the mare's water to break.",
        "When it does, the mare enters stage 2 of labor.",
        "You'll need to be paying attention because it can look like urination if you're not watching closely, as it is just an eruption of liquid from the vulva.",
        "You may also see the membrane peeking out of the vulva right before it ruptures.",
        "Start timing when you see the mare's water break.",
        "It shouldn't take more than 30 minutes from the water breaking for the horse to give birth.",
        "If it does take longer, the mare probably has a complication.",
        "If nothing has happened after 15 minutes, you should call the vet.",
        "Cut the chorioallantois membrane if it appears.",
        "The amnion membrane should be white as it peeks out of the vulva.",
        "If it's red, that means it's the chorioallantois, and the foal isn't getting oxygen.",
        "You'll need to cut the end of the membrane so it ruptures and immediately call the vet since it is an emergency.",
        "With gloves on, use clean scissors or a knife to cut through the membrane.",
        "Just make a slit in it long enough to let the liquid out.",
        "It doesn't need to be neat or tidy.",
        "Look for the foal's hooves, pointed downward.",
        "A foal should come out hooves first, shortly followed by the head.",
        "The hooves will be pointed downward in a normal birth.",
        "Make sure you can see 2 hooves or else one leg might be tucked back.",
        "If they're not, you'll need to call your veterinarian, as something is likely wrong, such as the baby is in the wrong position.",
        "Gently pull on the foal to help the horse give birth if you had to cut the red membrane.",
        "Firmly apply steady pressure and pull while the mare is pushing.",
        "Otherwise, let the horse do the work.",
        "Call an equine vet if something goes wrong.",
        "If you see the red membrane first, call the vet immediately after cutting it.",
        "Similarly, if the hooves on the foal are pointed upward, you only see 1 hoof, or you see 2 hooves but not the head, call the vet as the baby is likely being born in the wrong position.",
        "Also call the vet if the labor doesn't seem to be progressing as it should.",
        "Caring for the Foal and Mare after Delivery Get the foal breathing as soon as it is fully delivered.",
        "Once the foal gets past the shoulders, it should come out quickly and land on the straw.",
        "If the sac around the foal is still intact after the foal struggles a bit, you'll need to rip or cut it open so the foal can breathe.",
        "Also, tilt the foal's head upward to clear it's nose of fluid.",
        "If tilting doesn't clear the nose, you can use a suction bulb to pull out mucus.",
        "If the foal is having trouble breathing use a towel to rub its abdomen and ribs, which may help it start breathing.",
        "If it's still having trouble, you can hold the foal upside down for a moment or two to let the fluid drain.",
        "Start artificial respiration if the foal doesn't breathe on its own by cupping your hands firmly over its mouth and nose.",
        "Breathe into one nostril steadily and gently, letting its chest rise and fall, then push air into the nostril again.",
        "Keep going until it can breathe on its own.",
        "Do not try to cut the cord.",
        "It will break naturally on its own.",
        "Have an umbilical clamp on hand.",
        "Give the mare and foal a chance to rest while you wait for the placenta.",
        "The mare will likely lay down on its side for 20 minutes or so while it recovers.",
        "During that time, the mare will likely display colic-like behavior as she works to deliver the placenta.",
        "Tie a knot in the placenta with twine and let it hang so your horse is more likely to pass it safely.",
        "Never pull on the placenta since it could break inside the mare and make it sick.",
        "The foal should stand up within an hour and start nursing within 2.",
        "If it doesn't, call your vet.",
        "Clean the navel stump by dipping it in an antiseptic.",
        "The navel stump is what's left behind on the foal when the umbilical cord breaks off, and it will be on the foal's belly, much like a human belly button.",
        "Pour an antiseptic solution into a cup.",
        "You can use a 0.5% chlorhexidine solution or a 2% iodine in it.",
        "Gently push the navel stump into the cup and hold it in there for 30 seconds.",
        "Watch for the passing of the placenta.",
        "This is stage 3 of labor, and the horse should pass it within 3 hours, though often it will happen within 1 hour.",
        "It will look like a large, white bag.",
        "If you don't see it within 3 hours, call your veterinarian, as not passing the placenta is dangerous for the mare and is considered an emergency.",
        "Once the placenta passes, spread it out so you can see the whole thing.",
        "If it has any pieces missing, call your veterinarian, as pieces that stay inside the horse can cause infection.",
        "Never try to remove the afterbirth from the mare, as this could lead to a serious uterine infection.",
        "Save the placenta so your vet can look at it to learn about the health of your mare and foal.",
        "Call the veterinarian if the mare or foal show signs of trouble in the next few days.",
        "If the mare doesn't want to eat, seems depressed or colicky, or seems weak in the days following labor, call the vet.",
        "Similarly, if she has discharge from her vulva that's brown or smells particularly bad or if you see a lot of blood with it, call your vet.",
        "If the foal seems to be having trouble nursing or getting around, call your vet."
