Remove both wheels, the left and right cranks, the bottom bracket, the front and rear derailleurs, the chain, the brakes, the handlebars, the seat, and the front forks. If you have any attachments on your bike, like a water bottle holder, take the screws off from those too. Put the screws and tiny parts from the bike in labeled plastic baggies so it\u2019s easier to reassemble it later. Remove any labels or decals from the bike frame. You might have a hard time taking them off if they\u2019re old and really stuck on there. If they won\u2019t peel off, use a blow dryer or heat gun to warm them up. The adhesive on the labels will loosen when it\u2019s warmed, making it easier to remove the labels from the frame. If you\u2019re having trouble peeling a label off with your fingers, use a putty knife to lift the edges of the label up off the frame. Wipe down the frame of the bike before you sand it. If there\u2019s any glue residue left over from the decals, spray a product like WD-40 on the frame and wipe off the residue with a cloth. Sand the frame of the bike so the new coat of paint is able to stick. If the frame has a thick or glossy paint on it, use a low-grit (rough) sandpaper to remove a lot of the old paint. If the frame has a matte paint on it or it\u2019s completely bare, use a high-grit (fine) sandpaper. Wipe the bike down thoroughly and let it dry. Use a cloth with soapy water. Apply painter\u2019s tape to the areas of the frame you don\u2019t want to be painted. There are a few parts of the frame that should be left paint-free:\nThe posts for the brakes. Any bearing surfaces. Any threads on the bike where something will need to be screwed in when you reassemble it. Hanging or Mounting the Frame Put together a painting station outside. If you can\u2019t work outside, make sure you set up in a well-ventilated area, like a garage with the garage door open. Lay a tarp or newspaper on the ground to catch any paint that drips. You\u2019ll also want to have a pair of safety goggles and a dust mask on hand. Hang the bike frame by looping wire or rope through the head tube. If you\u2019re painting outside, look for something to hang the wire or rope from, like a tree branch or a rafter on a covered porch. If you\u2019re working inside, hang the wire or rope from the ceiling. The goal is to hang the frame in a location where you can easily walk around it and paint every side.

Avoid generic brands that will leave the coat on the frame looking uneven. Never combine different brands of spray paint. The different paints might react badly with each other.
