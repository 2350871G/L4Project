Make sure you can push the cable all the way down to the bottom of the trench, so that it won\u2019t jut out of the trench when you go to bury it. Connecting the Wiring to the House Run the cable up to the outdoor outlet and strip the end of it. Use wire strippers to cut the end of the cable and remove about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) of rubber insulation. This should leave 2 wires exposed. You can also use a utility knife to strip the wire, although it will be much easier to use the wire strippers. If the cable has cable nuts, remove them before stripping it. Attach the 2 exposed wires from the cable to the transformer box. Slide the wires under the 2 screws (called terminal screws) located on the bottom of the transformer box.

The inside of the transformer box should include guidelines and brief instructions on how to safely attach these wires to the box.

You can also mount the box onto the side of your house if you have wooden or vinyl siding. Use a screwdriver to drive a screw through the back of the box and into the siding.
