Lay a ruler horizontally on the center of the square and make a small mark in the middle using a pencil. Then, turn the ruler vertically so it's lined up with your mark and make a small dot in the center. The small dot will be the center of your color wheel. Use a compass to make a small circle 2 \u20442 inches (6.4 cm) away from the center. Attach a pencil to a drawing compass and stick the other leg of the compass on the center dot. Extend the pencil leg of the compass so it's about 2 \u20442 inches (6.4 cm) from the dot.

To create another row for your color wheel, make a slightly larger circle beyond the small one you just made. Adjust your compass so it's 5 \u20442 inches (14 cm) from the dot and rotate it to make a circle. Draw the outer circle 8 \u20442 inches (22 cm) from the center.
