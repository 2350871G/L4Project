        "The latex can be a variety of colors and may react with the skin or air changing colors.",
        "To determine if a mushroom will produce this substance:\nMake sure the mushroom is fresh enough to produce latex; often older specimens will dry out.",
        "Use a knife to make a small incision, either where the stem and gills meet or where the gills meet the cap.",
        "Watch for latex to ooze out.",
        "If it does, watch it continuously 3-5 minutes.",
        "Notice any color change.",
        "Then check back after 1 or 2 hours to see if any reaction has occurred.",
        "You will want to note the original latex and skin color, as a key feature can be the color reaction between them.",
        "For example, a mushroom with white latex and skin may later be stained purple from this contact.",
        "Notice any particular odors.",
        "While not a key feature in all mushrooms, the smell can be an identifying characteristic.",
