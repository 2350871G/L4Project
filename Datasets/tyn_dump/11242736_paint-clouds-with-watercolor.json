                    "description": "Watercolor paper will begin to bend and warp when it gets wet. To keep your paper flat, use masking tape to affix each side of the paper to your table, board, or work surface. Start with any side and smooth the tape down before taping an adjacent side. Before you tape the other 2 sides, smooth the paper down in the middle to remove any air bubbles.Tip: The masking tape will leave an empty border around your painting. This can create an elegant look for your edges, or you choose to cut them off later if you prefer. Work on a flat surface when using watercolor paints. If you place the board on an easel the wet paint could drip down your paper. Dry painting refers to a watercolor technique where the paper is dry but your brush is wet. This keeps watercolor paints contained and prevents a ton of bleeding early on. You can readjust your paper by lifting the tape and reapplying it. Masking tape won\u2019t damage your paper."

Add darker tans, pinks, yellows, or blues to your brush and use scumbling and circular strokes to expand the size of your clouds. Do not let your first layers dry before doing this. If you do, the paint won\u2019t blend and it will look like there are smaller clouds in front of your first layer. Generally, the darkest part of a cloud is the bottom of it.

You want a variety of ranges in the darker colors of your clouds. Most clouds have sections that are darker and lighter than the sky behind them. This method is excellent for creating clouds with a range of color. The negative space will form the lighter part and the darker paints will be the shadowy portions underneath.

Don\u2019t worry about the paint bleeding away from your brush marks. This method relies on bleeding to generate edges and textures. Use a darker shade to deepen smaller sections you\u2019ve already painted. Load your brush with a larger amount of the darker of your 2 colors. Quickly dot a few sections in the lower portion of each cloud to give them some depth. Allow your dots to bleed into other portions of your page to let them blend together. Remove any sections that you want to highlight with a clean, wet brush. Clean your brush by brushing the bottom of your cup of water and wiping it clean with a paper towel. Dip your dry, clean brush against any section of your cloud that you want to highlight. Dot the brush on the page to soak up some color in your brush.Tip: Unless you\u2019re using a strange or unique perspective, place your highlights near the top of your clouds to create the impression that the sun is shining down on them. Clean your brush after each time that you use it to remove color. Use a single color to paint in your background sky, leaving some negative space. Choose a single, solid color to fill in sky. Bright blue will make your clouds pop, while a lighter blue will create a softer, lighter impression. Load a clean, round brush with water and mix it with your color. Use back-and-forth strokes fill in the majority of your sky, leaving some negative space around the top of your clouds. The amount of negative space that you leave will determine how thick the highlights on your clouds will be. For a standard 8.5 by 11 inches (22 by 28 cm) piece of paper, you can leave 0.5\u20132 inches (1.3\u20135.1 cm) of space. You can leave negative space around and in different parts of your cloud if you\u2019re using a unique perspective. Leaving negative space on top makes the most sense if there\u2019s a horizon line at the bottom of your paper. Feather the edges of your clouds by dotting the edges of the negative space. Use a clean, wet brush that is smaller than your previous brush to add water to the area where your sky meets the negative space that you left. This will cause the color to bleed and will smooth out the harsh contrast between the emptiness of your paper and the background color of the sky. Dot water along the line where these 2 layers meet to feather the edges of your cloud. If you are going for a more surreal or impressionistic style, you can skip this step. Finish any foreground elements or shapes. Once your sky is completed, you can proceed to finish the rest of your image. Add any darker colors to your image and complete your foreground. Black vignettes of trees or buildings at the bottom of your paper can make for a striking composition with this technique. Using Unique Alternatives Fill a spray bottle with watercolor to add mist or abstract clouds. Add a few ounces of water to a spray bottle and load a damp brush with your desired cloud color. Dip the brush in the bottle and wipe it against the bottom to add your color. Shake the bottle to mix it, and hold it 1\u20133 feet (0.30\u20130.91 m) away from your paper. Put the bottle to a medium nozzle setting and spray it in your desired location to add a misty, abstract set of clouds. You can perform this method while wet or dry painting. You can repeat this process with multiple colors to create a set of abstract clouds with a variety of colors. The farther away that you hold the bottle, the less definition your clouds will have. Sprinkle table salt over wet watercolor to create unique clouds. Paint your sky first. While the watercolor paints are still wet, pick up some table salt. Sprinkle the salt in any locations that you want to create your clouds. Wait for your paper to completely dry and then wipe away the dried salt with a dry brush. The result will be a unique blend of spotty textures that resemble lighter clouds. You can use a salt grinder to get different sizes of granules. Salt can also be used to add texture to grasses, trees, or skin. Apply masking fluid before painting and peel it away to make clouds. Use a brush and masking fluid to paint your clouds on the paper before making it wet. Fill in each shape and wait 10-15 minutes for the fluid to dry. Paint the rest of the composition, and then wait for the watercolors to dry. At the end, rub off the dried masking fluid with the pad of your finger to reveal the negative space underneath.Tip: Masking fluid works kind of like painter\u2019s tape for watercolor. Any portion of your paper that has dried masking fluid on it won\u2019t get wet when you paint the rest of your image. You can use masking tape to create your cloud\u2019s highlights as well. Use paper towels on a wet sky to soak up color and create softer clouds. Paint your entire sky using flat, even back-and-forth strokes. Take a paper towel and crumple it in your hand until is the size that you want for your cloud. Press the crumpled paper towel into the sky for 1-2 seconds to soak up some of the watercolor. Lift your paper towel up to reveal a fluid, softer cloud. Repeat this process with different sizes of crumpled paper towels to create a variety of clouds across your sky. The harder that you press the paper towel down, the more color you are going to soak up. You can use toilet paper instead of paper towels if you want. The texture of paper towels helps to create the texture of the clouds though, so try to use a toilet paper with a pattern imprinted in it.",
