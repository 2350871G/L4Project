        "Throughout the growing season, the primary purpose of pruning is to keep your roses healthy and active.",
        "This can be achieved by removing any unhealthy-looking parts of the plant that could become an issue if left alone.",
        "Deadhead dead and dying blooms to extend the bloom season.",
        "Deadheading is the practice of snipping off spent or failing flowers in order to make room for new ones.",
        "Snip the stem down to first group of five leaflets below the flower cluster.",
        "In a few short weeks, another round of blooms will appear in their place.",
        "In most cases, you\u2019ll be making your cuts approximately 6\u20138 inches (15\u201320 cm) below the flowers themselves.",
        "During extreme heat, only cut back to the first set of leaves rather than going further down the stem.",
        "Deadheading is essential for improving both the health and aesthetic quality of your knockout roses.",
        "Aim for a uniform appearance.",
        "If a few fast-growing shoots exceed the length of the surrounding shoots, trim the longer sections to restore the plant to an even length.",
        "Repeat this process on all visible sides of the bush.",
        "Otherwise, it can quickly overtake its surroundings and begin looking unruly.",
        "In addition to vertical growth, new growth will also expand outward and below the plant in the spring and summer.",
        "This \"leggy\" undergrowth should also be kept short.",
        "Trimming Your Roses Before Winter Prune 1 final time if desired before the first frost of the year.",
        "Ideally, you should aim to have your pruning done by the end of summer or the first couple weeks of fall, when the weather is still warm.",
        "Once it gets cold, new growth will begin to taper off as the plant prepares to enter dormancy.",
        "Stop pruning your knockout roses in early fall at the latest.",
        "Any new growth they put out after this time may not harden off in time for winter.",
        "Your roses will benefit from getting a little rest before the next growing season.",
        "Clear away dead wood.",
        "Just like you did in the summer, inspect your knockout roses carefully once more to identify and cull weak, sick, or dying canes.",
        "Otherwise, disease could spread throughout the bush unchecked, kill it off completely by the time winter sets in.",
        "At this point, it\u2019s advisable to remove as little of the plant\u2019s overall size as necessary.",
        "Avoid disturbing younger canes.",
        "You don\u2019t want to accidentally stimulate new growth that will just die off and weaken the plant.",
        "Reduce the overall height of your rose bushes.",
        "Just before your roses retire for the season, you can trim up to one-third off their total height.",
        "Focus on excess growth that doesn\u2019t contribute to the general shape of the bush.",
        "If there are any long, non-flowering stems sticking out from the top or sides, be sure to see to these as well.",
        "If your roses just barely managed to reach their ideal height during the peak growing season, a little light corrective pruning will be best.",
        "Fall pruning is not a major ordeal, and many gardeners even choose to skip it altogether."
