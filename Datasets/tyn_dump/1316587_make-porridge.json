        "Keeping the temperature up too high will result in the barley burning and the water evaporating too quickly.",
        "If you don't have 4 people to serve, this recipe is easily cut in half.",
        "However, don't necessarily modify the toppings too much \u2013 if you like it sweet, you may need just as much sugar!",
        "Simmer until the barley is tender, about 45-60 minutes.",
        "Barley is a tough nut to crack (figuratively, of course.",
        "Literally barley is a grain with just a nutty flavor).",
        "Because of it's tougher consistency, it takes longer than oats or rice to make tender.",
        "Stir every 10 minutes or so, checking on how it's doing.",
        "Every pot will differ slightly in the time needed to cook.",
        "Keep the lid on as much as possible.",
        "When 10 minutes is up, take it off and give it a few stirs with a wooden spoon.",
        "When the water is mostly gone, the barley is done.",
        "Drain the cooked barley.",
        "Even if you're looking for a runnier porridge, drain the cooked barley.",
        "The water that's left probably won't taste as good and rich as a cup of milk will.",
        "This is easiest to do with a plastic or metal colander.",
        "If you're in a bind, hold the lid up the edge of the pan and tip it over into the sink to dispel the water.",
        "Combine the cooked barley and the rest of the ingredients in a medium saucepan over medium heat.",
        "1 cup of milk, 1 tablespoon of brown sugar, \u00bd teaspoon cinnamon will turn your plain barley into a regular breakfast feast.",
        "Modify the sweetness as you see fit, of course.",
        "The milk is necessary (the fatter the milk, the creamier the taste), but you can experiment with the brown sugar and cinnamon and explore other things like honey, fruit juice, or yogurt, too.",
        "Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 15 more minutes.",
        "This is generally how long it takes until the milk has almost been entirely absorbed.",
        "What's more, the barley will take on some of the sweet, cinnamon-y flavor.",
        "When it has a thick, glutinous, porridge-like consistency, it's done!",
        "You can add more milk if you'd like it a little thinner.",
        "Divide the porridge between four bowls.",
        "Right now you just have basic barley porridge.",
        "To spice things up, top each dish with walnuts, a drizzle of heavy cream, and fruit, if desired.",
        "There\u2019s no getting tired of that!",
        "If you're the curious type, try yogurt, peanut butter, cocoa, honey, or any other addition that you think would make the porridge a breakfast of champions.",
        "Simple Porridge with Bananas and Nuts Put skimmed milk on to boil in a pan.",
        "Add two bananas (reasonably ripe).",
        "Add a touch of vanilla essences, nutmeg and cinnamon (or other spices that you like).",
        "Add cheap porridge.",
        "Keep stirring for 4-5 minutes whilst it simmers.",
        "Put in two bowls.",
        "Add a mix of your favourite nuts and seeds on top with a little extra milk.",
        "Try cashews, sunflower seeds, hemp seeds, linseed, pumpkins all of which you can roast in the oven, when the oven is in use for something else.",
        "Finished."
