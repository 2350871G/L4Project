If the surface is covered with pretty obvious marks, use a piece of 2000-grit or so micro-mesh to buff the surface. Work in short, vertical movements, keeping the micro-mesh moving in the same direction as you go. You can purchase micro-mesh online, or in a hardware or home improvement store. You can also use finishing paper to get rid of scratches and blemishes. Place a cork sanding block on top of the micro-mesh sheet to make the sanding process easier."

After rubbing the entire surface, continue switching to a higher grit, like 6000. Keep alternating your micro-mesh sheets and rubbing the surface of the lacquer until the scratches and blemishes are barely visible.

Additionally, examine the lacquer to make sure that it\u2019s completely smooth and reflective. You don\u2019t want there to be any visible scratches once you apply the polish. Handheld Sander Alternatives\nIf you have a handheld sander, you can use it to polish your wood lacquer. Similar to the micro-mesh process, use a 2000-grit sanding pad to expose any scratches in the lacquer, then spray a 3000-grit pad with water. Use this soaked pad to buff the entire surface of your project. Once you\u2019ve finished sanding, switch out your sanding pad with a wool pad. Squeeze a grape-sized amount of ceramic polish onto the pad, then buff it into the lacquer at a low speed (less than 1000 RPM). After you\u2019ve finished this, use foam pads and a small amount of ceramic polish to finish buffing and restoring the wood surface. As a finishing touch, clean the surface with a water-based cleaning spray and polishing surface."
