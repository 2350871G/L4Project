Your skin is made up up layers, and as the dye seeps into your skin, it will dye it layer by layer. If you allow the dye to sit on your hands, it will be able to dye more layers of your skin, and deeper layers of your skin. If the dye is allowed to stain the deep layers of your skin, it will likely take harsh measures to remove, which may damage your skin."

Removing the dead, dyed skin cells of your hands will reveal the new skin underneath, which may not be stained yet. Scrub your hands for about 30 seconds, then rinse with warm water. If your hands are still stained, try scrubbing again, only this time add a pinch of baking soda."

The oils will slowly dissolve and break down the dye while simultaneously softening and conditioning your skin. Rub the oil over your hands using a cotton ball or a damp washcloth. The oil may ruin your sheets if you touch them while you sleep, so try wearing gloves or even clean socks on your hands while you sleep.
