It is also a good idea to find a zipper that is in the same color as your fabric, or as close as you can get. For example, if the zipper opening is 8 inches (20 cm), then choose a zipper that is 10 inches (25 cm) long. If you cannot find an exact color match for your zipper, choose a zipper that is in a similar shade, such as a black zipper for a dark purple dress, or a white zipper for a light blue garment."

The interfacing should be the same width as the zipper plus your seam allowance. For example, if the zipper opening is 8 inches (20 cm), then the interfacing should be 9.5 inches (24 cm) long.

Then, remove the presser foot attachment and install the zipper foot. Reattach the presser foot and secure it with the screw(s) you removed. Applying Interfacing to Stabilize the Zipper Place a fusible interfacing strip where you will be sewing the zipper. Place the fabric on a flat surface with the wrong (non-print) side facing up. Then, lay 1 of the fusible interfacing strips on the edge of the fabric where you want to place the zipper. The adhesive side should be facing down towards the wrong side of the fabric. The adhesive side of fusible interfacing is usually glossy or smooth to the touch. Press the interfacing with an iron for 3 to 5 seconds. With your iron on the lowest setting, smooth it across the interfacing. Do this for 3 to 5 seconds to bond the interfacing with your fabric. Make sure the fabric and interfacing are flat before you iron over them. Otherwise, you may end up with bumps in the interfacing. Repeat on the opposite side. Next, go through the exact same process for the other side of the fabric and the other piece of interfacing. After the other piece of interfacing is bonded with the fabric, turn your fabric over and start pinning and sewing your invisible zipper into place. Pinning and Sewing the Zipper Iron the zipper fabric. To ensure that your zipper will lay flat, iron the fabric that is attached to the zipper. Set your iron to the lowest setting, and run it over the zipper fabric a couple of times to flatten it out. Be extra careful with plastic zippers, which may melt if you iron over them. Pin the zipper to the right (print) side of the fabric\u2019s edges. Place the closed zipper over the right side of the fabric with the zipper pull facing downwards. Line up the raw edge of the fabric with the edge of the zipper fabric. Then, insert a pin through the top part of the zipper fabric and zipper opening fabric. Open the zipper, and then continue pinning down the length of the zipper opening. Some of your zipper will extend down past the zipper opening in your fabric. Don\u2019t worry about pinning this area. Repeat this for the other side to secure the other half of the zipper. Position the fabric and zipper under the zipper foot on your machine.

Finishing the Zipper Close the zipper and fold the fabric in half with the wrong sides visible. Zip up the zipper and then fold the fabric along the zipper. Fold the fabric so that the right sides are together and the wrong sides are exposed. The back of the zipper should also be visible. Place a pin along the bottom edge of the zipper opening.

        "The back of the zipper should also be visible.",
        "Place a pin along the bottom edge of the zipper opening.",
        "Hold the zipper out to the side so it is out of the way.",
        "Then, insert 1 pin through the zipper opening fabric so that it is pointing towards the zipper stitch line.",
        "Place the pin slightly to the left of the stitch line so you can use the zipper stitch line as your guide when you sew.",
        "You may also want to place a pin through the zipper and fabric to keep it out of your way, but this is optional.",
        "You can also just keep holding it out of the way until you sew past it.",
        "Sew down from the zipper stitch line to the bottom of the fabric.",
        "Using the pin as your guide, sew downwards from the zipper stitch line and keep going until you reach the end of the fabric.",
        "Sew right off the edge of the fabric to secure the seam.",
        "This will create a seam that is flush with your invisible zipper seam.",
        "Only sew through the zipper opening fabric, not the zipper.",
        "Do not sew through the pin you placed in the fabric or you may damage your machine.",
        "You can remove the pin after the first few stitches.",
        "Continue your project after the zipper is in place.",
        "You may sew an invisible zipper before hemming a garment or putting on other finishing touches, so make sure to finish these up after you have completed your invisible zipper.",
        "Consult your pattern (if you are using one) to finish sewing for your project."
