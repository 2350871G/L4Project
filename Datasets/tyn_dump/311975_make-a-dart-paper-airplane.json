Open up both of these last creases halfway so that the long edges furthest from the center crease form two wings. The center crease you have had all along will now be at the bottom of your paper airplane. Your finished airplane should be about 12 inches long and 4 inches wide at the widest point of the wings. Grab your paper airplane along the bottom crease and throw it! You now have a dart paper airplane. If your airplane has problems flying, experiment with changing its weight distribution. Attach a small paper clip to the bottom crease, pointing up toward the wings. Try positioning it in different locations up and down the center crease to determine where the weight helps the most. Making a Deluxe Dart Paper Airplane Start with a standard letter-sized piece of paper that measures 8 1/2 inches by 11 inches (A4, printer paper). This size is usually easy to find, as it's the one used in most printers. Grab the top left-hand corner and fold it down and to the right on the other side of the paper. Once folded, the original top of the paper should be aligned with the right side. Make a crease along this fold. Grab the top right-hand corner of the paper and fold it down and to the left. This point should meet the left side of the paper at the very end of the first crease you made. Make a crease along this fold. Fold the paper in half lengthwise. Make sure that this fold conceals the previous folds inside. Grab the right outer point (opposite the centerfold) and fold it down and to the left, so the edge coming down from the top point aligns with the center crease.. Remember to make a crease along this fold. Flip your plane over and repeat the previous fold on the opposite side. Remember to crease this fold as well. Fold each side in half again, bringing the long edge of each side down to meet the center crease. You will end up with two very long sides and small points coming out of the short end. Fold the new long edge down to meet the center crease one more time. Repeat this on both sides. These folds may be hard to make, as they will result in really skinny long wings, but will create a very fast and straight flying paper airplane. Open up these last folds halfway. Hold the airplane so that the wings stick out and you are holding the body of the plane. Place an inch-and-a-half (3.81cm) long piece of tape along the top over the crevice between the two wings. This will keep your plane in the right shape. Do not go all the way across and don't start from the very tip. Start where the corners of the tape stay within the wings. The tape is simply there to keep the wings together. Hold your paper airplane by the body and toss it. Watch it fly!",
