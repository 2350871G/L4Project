They hurt your hands after only a few minutes and the balance is poor for beginners. On the internet you can get good clubs from jugglenow.com or Brian Dube Juggling. (See External Links for one of each.) Start like you started juggling three balls. Don't try to hold all three clubs in your hands at first. Just start with one. Hold it in your dominant hand (right, for this article) and practice tossing it to your other hand. Try to get one good solid flip, and aim for consistent throws. You want the apex of the toss to be just above eye level. Any higher and your throws will be out of control. Any lower and you won't have time to get that second toss in. Practice with just your dominant hand until you get good, consistent throws.  To add in the second club, hold it in your left hand between the middle and ring fingers, and just leave it there. Now continue your single throws, getting used to having a club in the other hand. Once you are again getting good consistent throws, add in the second throw just like you did with balls. Toss the second club when the first begins its descent from its apex. Throw it under the first club, and aim for one good flip, then catch it in your right hand. STOP! Don't try to do 100, or even ten tosses. Just do two, then see how you did. You're going to drop a lot. We all did. It will come. Be patient. Once you can reliably catch both clubs, add in the third.
