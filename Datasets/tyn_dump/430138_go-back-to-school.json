Think about the main outfits you\u2019d need throughout the school year. Do you need gym clothes? Should you get a new winter coat?"

Whether you\u2019re just getting a trim or going for a completely different hair style, make sure you find a hairstylist that you trust. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask them questions about what look suits the shape of your face and texture of your hair. You do not have to trim anything off your hair if you learn how to create different styles. For example, learn different braids or style your bangs. Research or ask a stylist which hair products work best for your hair. For example, gel is great for hold but gives you a wet look."
