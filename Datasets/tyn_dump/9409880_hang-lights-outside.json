For instance, the roof of your home, trees on your property, fence posts along borders, and patio structures or awnings can be utilized to hang outdoor lights so that you don\u2019t have to create separate posts to mount/anchor them to. For example, string lights between your home and garage over your lawn. Alternatively, hang lights between your deck and posts you place throughout the yard."

For example, you may want to zigzag a string of lights over your fire pit or patio area. Alternatively, you could wind strings of lights between patio posts."
