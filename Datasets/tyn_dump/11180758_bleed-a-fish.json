Feel the area directly behind the fish\u2019s eye with your dominant hand to find a soft spot, which is where the fish\u2019s brain is located.

Push the knife through the fish\u2019s skin and press it down into the brain to stun it. The fish may twitch or jerk as soon as you cut into it, but it will stop moving soon after. Push the knife completely through the fish to sever the nerves and remove it once the fish stops twitching. If the fish still struggles after you stab into it with the knife, try positioning the knife 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the original cut and stabbing it again. Keep your fingers away from the blade of the knife so you don't accidentally cut yourself."
