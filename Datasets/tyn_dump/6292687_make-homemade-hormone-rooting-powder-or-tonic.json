Let the water heat up completely until it comes to a rolling boil. Turn the heat to low to let the water simmer before moving on. You can also use purified or filtered water if you\u2019re worried about any foreign substances in your tap water. Stir in 2 US tbsp (30 ml) of honey and let the solution cool. Use standard honey from a grocery store for your rooting hormone. Scoop the honey directly into the pot of simmering water and use a mixing spoon to stir it together. As soon as the honey dissolves completely in the water, turn off the heat and let the pot cool completely. Honey contains antibacterial, antiseptic, and antifungal properties as well as promotes healthy root growth.Tip: Put a lid on the pot while it cools to prevent anything from contaminating the solution.

Let the cuttings absorb the aspirin solution for about 2-3 hours so they remain healthy after you plant them. Brewing a Willow Water Solution Collect 2 cups (256 g) of young branches from a willow tree. Collect the branches in spring when new growths are forming on the tree. Look for fresh green shoots and branches that are skinnier than a pencil to use for your rooting tonic. Use a pair or pruning shears or a sharp utility knife to cut the willow branches at a 45-degree angle so the tree doesn\u2019t develop rot. You can use any type of willow for your rooting hormone. Don\u2019t use any dead branches since they won\u2019t contain any of the natural rooting hormones.Variation: You may also collect the bark from established willows if you\u2019re able. If you use bark, collect 3 cups (384 g) instead since it contains fewer hormones. Cut the branches into 1 in (2.5 cm) pieces. Use a sharp knife or a pair of pruning shears to cut the branches to a smaller size. Make sure each section of branch is about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long so they can easily submerge them later on. Willows contain salicylic and indole butyric acids, which are natural growth hormones that will help your cutting quickly form roots once you plant it. Cut bark pieces to the same size if you used them instead of branches. Add the willow pieces to boiling water and let them soak for 24 hours. Bring 1 gallon (3.8 L) or water to boil over high heat on your stove. As soon as the water comes to a rolling boil, turn off the heat and pour in the willow branches so they can soak. Put a lid on the pot and leave the branches inside for 24 hours. During that time, the hormones will extract from the branches and mix with the water. Adjust the recipe if you don\u2019t want to make as much rooting hormone, but keep a ratio of 2 cups (256 g) of willow pieces to 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water. Pour the liquid from the pot into glass containers with lids. After the solution cools, carefully transfer the solution into separate containers.
