Stir the ingredients together but don\u2019t worry about fully combining them. For the best chocolate shell sauce, use 66 to 72% dark chocolate. Be sure to use refined coconut oil, which has more of a neutral flavor. If you use an unrefined or virgin coconut oil, your chocolate sauce will have a coconut flavor. The corn syrup helps add sweetness and a fudge-like texture to the sauce. However, you can omit it if you prefer."
