Pulling these on before you stick your hand into germ-filled toilet water will make the task a lot more bearable. If you\u2019re out somewhere and don\u2019t have the benefit of gloves, you\u2019ll have to decide whether it\u2019s worth taking the plunge. Don\u2019t flush anything that\u2019s too big to fit through the pipes of the toilet. Then you\u2019ll just have an additional mess to deal with. Assuming gloves are not an option, think on your feet and use some other object, such as a wad of paper towels or a plastic bag turned inside out, to protect your hand from the worst of the mess while you go after the dropped item. If you just can\u2019t stand the notion of getting your hands dirty, certain objects, like jewelry or house keys, may be retrievable using a coat hanger that\u2019s been bent into a hook."
