                    "description": "A splitting maul is essentially a thicker, more wedge-shaped axe made for splitting hardwood along the grain, with a blunt sledge-hammer edge on the back of the splitting blade. These are typically somewhat heavier than an axe, usually by several pounds, and the weight of the maul makes the job easier. Splitting wedges are basically metal wedges that you drive into the wood with a sledge. The benefit of the wedge is that you can place it along the grain to split the wood, then drive it into the exact same place until it splits. Axes are used to chop wood, not to split it. It's best to use a maul or splitting wedges if you want to split hardwood."

                    "description": "Normal wood stoves and smaller fireplaces usually take a 16 to 20-inch (40 to 50 cm) log, and the shorter the log is, the more easily it will split. You should cut your wood to the most efficient length for your purpose, in terms of both handling and storing it, as well as making it a suitable length for your application. Try to cut the ends of each piece of firewood square and flat, as you will need to stand them on end to split them, and crooked cuts will make this difficult to do."

A wood surface about 6 inches off the ground is appropriate for any splitting job. The block should be neither too high nor too short, to avoid dangerous ricochets if you should strike a glancing blow. Always split on some kind of block, never the ground and never concrete. The ground will do in a pinch, but you'll tire more easily if you have to lift the heavy maul that much higher.

Split each block of wood into progressively smaller pieces, until they are the desired size.
