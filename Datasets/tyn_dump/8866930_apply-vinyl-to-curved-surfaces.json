For most surfaces, soap and warm water or an ammonia based cleaner, like most window cleaners, work well. Wipe the surface completely dry after cleaning, then mark the placement of your design with painter\u2019s tape. You can substitute another weak adhesive tape, like masking tape, for painter\u2019s tape. Weak adhesive tape will be easier to remove later and isn\u2019t likely to leave behind an adhesive film. For a more precise outline, use a grease pencil to draw the placement of your design on the surface. Some surfaces may react negatively to grease pencils. Test pencils on an out of sight area first."
