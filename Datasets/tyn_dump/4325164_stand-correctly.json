Some people may have too much of a curve in their lower back, called \u201chyperlordosis,\u201d which is often caused by weak core muscles or excessive abdominal weight. Other people may stand with their pelvis tucked too far in, causing the lower back to be straight instead of maintaining its natural curve. This is called a \u201cflat back\u201d and is also unhealthy. It can be caused by sitting for too long in one position or by tightness in your core muscles. If you are prone to low back pain, try contracting your abdominal muscles a little. Imagine you have a corset that is pulling your stomach muscles in and upward. Your back will be supported. Don\u2019t tilt your pelvis; use your abs to support your body. It may take time to develop postural muscles in your legs, belly, back and shoulders. Keep with it for several months to get pain-relieving results."

Keeping one foot slightly forward of the other can help relieve pressure from your lower back muscles. Keep your feet pointed forward, not out to the sides. Move your body weight to the balls of your feet. If your weight was on the outside of your feet, you are pronated. If your weight was previously on the inside of your feet, you are supinated.

If it is very hard to move the weight to the balls of your feet, you can consult a podiatrist to get custom orthotics. They can help correct your posture. Don\u2019t lock your knees. There should be a very slight, almost imperceptible, bend in them. Locking your knees increases stress on your joints. Adjust the curvature of your spine. Your lower back should have a slight curve to it. Some people may have too much of a curve in their lower back, called \u201chyperlordosis,\u201d which is often caused by weak core muscles or excessive abdominal weight.

An easy way to check whether your shoulders are rounded or not is to stand in front of a mirror. Let your arms drop to your sides and hang naturally. If your knuckles face the front, your shoulders may be more rounded than is healthy. Focus on pulling your shoulders back just a bit to counteract this roundedness. You can improve your muscle balance and reduce rounded shoulders by strengthening your upper back and core muscles. Pinch your shoulder blades together about an inch (2.5cm). People who work at computers can become hunched. Practice pinching your shoulder blades together to counteract the effects of computer work. Don\u2019t overcorrect by pulling your shoulder blades too far back. This can create a hinge effect at your lower back that can cause pain. Keep your head even. Try to avoid slumping forward.

This is especially important after a day of sitting. If you can do stretching exercises such as  yoga regularly, this can help develop flexibility in your muscles and improve posture. Balance on one leg while standing in front of a mirror. Try to keep your body completely straight, instead of listing to one side. Hold this position for 30 seconds, then repeat on the other side. Work on improving your  balance. Better balance increases strength and improves your posture. It can also reduce your risk of injury. Stand on one foot and bring the opposite foot directly behind you about four inches. Bring it forward again, keeping it in line with your hip the whole time. Repeat 10-15 times on both sides. Stand on one foot. Lift one leg out to the side and hold the position for 1-5 seconds. Lower your leg. Repeat 10-15 times on both sides. Do wall squats.

Hold your breath for 5 seconds, then slowly lower yourself to the floor again. Standing at Work Practice good posture. Standing for long periods of time can have similar effects to sitting for long periods of time. If you have weak muscles, such as the abdominal and glute muscles, your other muscles will get tighter. There has to be a balance. Avoid leaning on one leg. Shifting your weight from one hip to another is bad for your posture. If your buttock and core muscles are weak, you may tend to stand with more of your weight on one leg to use your lower back and hips to balance you. Stand with your weight distributed evenly between your legs. If your buttocks and core muscles are weak, do exercises to strengthen them such as planks, side-lying leg raises, and bridges. You can also squeeze your butt muscles while standing to make sure the glute muscles don\u2019t get weak. Do this several times a day. Alternate between sitting and standing. If possible, alternate the two positions every 30 minutes, for maximum benefit. Standing all day can have adverse affects on your health, just like sitting, because your joints are supporting you all day. Ideally, find a sit-stand workstation that can be used when sitting or standing. See if you can get an adjustable-height desk.

A small gel mat works well to give your feet extra support. Wear supportive shoes. Don\u2019t stand at work in heels or flat shoes without arch supports. Add arch supports to your shoes if they don\u2019t have them already. Start with short, 10-minute, periods of standing. As you develop your postural muscles you can increase these periods. Standing too long too soon can result in a backache. Learn to break up your workday with standing activities and sitting activities. Standing while answering email, calling or doing research is advantageous because you are likely to do it for 30 minutes and move on. Typing and activities that require honed motor skills are easier to do when sitting. Substitute walking around for standing if your work doesn\u2019t support an adjustable height desk.
