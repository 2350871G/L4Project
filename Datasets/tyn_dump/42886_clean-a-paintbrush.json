Using Fabric Softener Wipe the excess paint from the brush. Run the brush over a paper towel or a cloth to get rid of as much paint as possible. Mix a gallon (3.8 L) of water with 1/2 cup (120 mL) fabric softener. Use warm (but not hot) water. This solution will help loosen the paint from the brush, making it slip right off.

Reshape the bristles and stand the brush up to dry. Let the bristles dry completely before storing your brush. Using Vinegar (for Paint-Hardened Brushes) Soak the brush in white vinegar for an hour. After an hour, check to see if you can bend the bristles back. If you can't, put it back in and keep soaking it for another hour. Place the brush in an old pot and cover it with vinegar. If there's still hardened paint in your bristles after 2 hours of soaking, try boiling. You want the vinegar to completely cover the brush's bristles. Bring the vinegar to a boil on the stove.

Swoosh the brush in a circular motion in your palm. While warm water is running, into your palm, swoosh the brush into the soap. Rinse and repeat until the soap no longer shows any signs of paint. This will require about three goes at least. Reshape your brush. Let it dry thoroughly before using again with oil paint.
