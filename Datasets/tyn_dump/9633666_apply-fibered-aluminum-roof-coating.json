For workshops, warehouses, and similar structures, it will be necessary to set up a portable ladder tall enough to clear the roof by a few feet. Once you're on top, tread carefully and stay a safe distance away from the edge of the building at all times. Have an assistant steady the ladder for you as you climb, and consider using a safety harness to avoid potential mishaps.

If you're working on a multi-story commercial building, the safest way to get onto the roof is to use the roof access stairwell or ladder located on the side or rear of the building.

        "This will help wear down lumps and ridges and create a more uniform surface.",
        "Continue sanding until each of the areas you repaired matches the look of the surrounding roof.",
        "A power sander can save you some time when you've got a lot of ground to cover.",
        "Sweep the roof again.",
        "Another quick once-over will be necessary to clear away the dust generated by sanding.",
        "Once you're done, the roof will be ready for its new finish.",
        "If you'd prefer, you can can also rinse off the entire roof with a hose.",
        "Just make sure you give it as much time as needed to dry completely afterwards.",
        "Mixing the Aluminum Roof Coating Wait until exterior conditions are optimal to begin applying the coating.",
        "Plan your project for a stretch where there\u2019s no rainfall expected for 24-36 hours.",
        "Fibered aluminum roof coatings provide the best coverage and dry fastest when outdoor temperatures are between 60\u2013100 \u00b0F (16\u201338 \u00b0C) with low humidity.",
        "Exposing the coating to excess moisture can result in a splotchy, inconsistent finish.",
        "Intense heat can also interfere with the coating\u2019s ability to dry correctly.",
        "Equip yourself with protective clothing and accessories.",
        "Before you crack open the liquid aluminum coating, make sure you put on close-toed shoes, a pair of thick work gloves, and some protective eyewear.",
        "It may also be a good idea to change into a set of old clothes that you don\u2019t mind ruining in case you get any of the coating on you.",
        "If you have sensitive airways, consider strapping on a ventilator or breathing mask to filter out irritating fumes.",
        "Open the bucket of aluminum roof coating.",
        "Remove the lid from the bucket and set it aside.",
        "When you first look inside, you\u2019ll likely notice a thin, black liquid resting at the top of the bucket.",
        "This is normal\u2014separation occurs when the heavier aluminum particles sink to the bottom of the watery asphalt binder.",
        "Mix the roof coating thoroughly.",
        "Attach a mixing paddle head to your electric drill and insert it all the way to the bottom of the bucket.",
        "Run the drill on the lowest speed to gently stir the liquid coating.",
        "When properly blended, it will take on a shiny, uniform metallic color.",
        "Be careful not to set the drill to too high a speed.",
        "This will just send aluminum splatters flying all over you and your work area.",
        "A paint stirrer, plunger, or similar device will also get the job done if you don't have access to a drill, though it may take more time to bring the coating to the right consistency.",
        "Rolling on the Coating Start in a far corner of the roof.",
        "From there, you can proceed across and down for total coverage.",
        "Work your way backwards toward your access point to avoid trapping yourself by accident.",
        "Make sure the rest of the rooftop is clear of any unneeded tools and materials.",
        "Pour the aluminum coating over a small section of the roof.",
        "Tip the bucket to drizzle about 1 quart (.95 L) over a strip 5\u20136 feet (1.5\u20131.8 m) in length.",
        "The creamy liquid coating spreads evenly, so avoid using too much at once.",
        "In order to work more efficiently, it\u2019s best to pour and smooth a little at a time.",
        "Try not to make a mess with the aluminum coating.",
        "It can be next to impossible to get out of clothing!",
        "Roll the coating into a thin, even layer.",
        "The most effective way to do this is by using a \u20444 inch (1.9 cm) nap roller.",
        "Glide the roller back and forth over the fresh coating, making all of your strokes in the same direction to keep the texture consistent.",
        "Cover 1 section of the roof completely before moving on to a neighboring section.",
        "Check to make sure there are no gaps or lines in the new finish.",
        "A long-handled roller will enable you to apply the coating over broader areas without the strain of bending and stooping.",
        "Continue pouring and rolling until you\u2019ve coated the entire roof.",
        "Proceed towards the roof\u2019s opposite corner, blending the edges of each section so that they run together seamlessly.",
        "Afterwards, all that\u2019s left to do is wait for the coating to dry.",
        "Remove all unneeded tools and equipment off the roof before you finish up the final section.",
        "Let the finish dry to the touch.",
        "Before you can turn your attention to fine detailing, the aluminum coating needs to be stable enough to walk on.",
        "It will usually reach this state within 5-8 hours, but it may take slightly longer if the weather outside is particularly cool or damp.",
        "In the meantime, avoid going onto the roof for any reason.",
        "Any mistakes made while the finish is still fresh will be much harder to correct.",
        "Go over out-of-the-way areas by hand.",
        "To touch up less accessible surfaces, it may help to swap your roller out for a handheld brush.",
        "Dip the brush into the aluminum coating and use the tip to fill in corners, crevices, and recesses.",
        "A paintbrush can also be useful for working around antennas, skylights, brackets, air conditioning units, and other tricky rooftop fixtures.",
        "Brush with long, linear strokes to prevent leaving drips in the dried finish.",
        "Allow the new coating to cure completely.",
        "It may take up to 24 hours to harden to the point where it can successfully protect against moisture, pressure, and heat.",
        "Once the coating has had ample time to dry, it will seal, protect, and extend the lifespan of your roof."
