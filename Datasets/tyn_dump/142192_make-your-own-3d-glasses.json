At that point, you're not saving much money compared to ready-made 3D glasses, so many people prefer to use poster board, cardstock, or ordinary paper folded in half. A sturdy poster board such as oak tag will last longer than other paper options. Cutting and folding the glasses frame is pretty intuitive, but you can print, cut out, and trace this template onto heavier stock if you prefer."

Whichever you choose, cut it out to be slightly larger than the eye holes in the glasses frames, so you have room to tape them together. Here are a few commonly available options:\nCellophane. This is the thin, flexible plastic sometimes used as \"windows\" on food packaging, or to wrap CD cases. Transparency sheet for overhead projectors. You can buy these at office supply stores. A hard CD \"jewel case\" itself. This should only be cut by a competent adult, due to the risk of shattering. Score the plastic repeatedly and lightly with a utility knife until there is a deep groove, then bend lightly to snap it apart. Acetate sheets (also called acetate film) are available at art supply stores or theatrical/stage lighting stores. These already come in red and cyan, so you can skip the coloring step."

Because your two eyes are detecting what looks like the same image from slightly different perspectives, you interpret it as a real 3D object. Some 3D DVDs (but not BluRay) and games that advertise \"anaglyph\" or \"stereoscopic\" modes will work with these glasses. Search online for \"anaglyph\" videos and images to find more 3D content.

Think of the polarizing filter as a barred window: light oriented (polarized) vertically passes between the bars and reaches your eye, while light oriented horizontally can't get through the bars and gets reflected away. With the \"bars\" over each eye pointing in different directions, each eye picks up a different image, and your brain interprets the two images as a single 3D image.

But if you're interested in the project, purchase a sheet of \"linearly polarized\" or \"plane polarized\" plastic film. Rotate the film 45\u00ba from the vertical, then cut out a lens. Rotate the film another 90\u00ba in either direction, and cut out the second lens. This is the most common design, but you may need to rotate the lens while looking at the 3D image to see what works. Just make sure to rotate both lenses at the same time, since they should always be made from film oriented exactly 90\u00ba apart. The actual explanation of polarized light is more technical than described above. Modern 3D glasses usually use circular polarized light, which doesn't require the viewer to keep his head still while watching. To make these lenses at home, you would need one sheet of counterclockwise circular polarized plastic, and one sheet of clockwise polarized plastic (also called left- and right-handed).

The special glasses you wear while watching are synchronized to the television, and each lens alternates between dark and clear at the exact same time, using tiny liquid crystal cells and an electrical signal. This is considered one of the most effective 3D glasses for comfortable, long-term use, but it's just not feasible to make these in your basement, let alone the television set programmed to synch with them."
