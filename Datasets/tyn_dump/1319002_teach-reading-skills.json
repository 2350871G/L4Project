Most students learn by seeing (visual learners), hearing (auditory learners), or doing (kinesthetic learners). Talk to your principal or school guidance counselor about which tests you can give them. Teach visual learners with outlines, diagrams, and illustrated handouts. Teach auditory learners through audio books, oral reports, and rhyming games. Teach kinesthetic learners through role-playing activities, games, and field trips.

        "Students absorb material better when they learn from their classmates.",
        "They can read aloud to each other and discuss what the reading meant to them.",
        "After about ten minutes of group work, have students report their discussions to the class.",
        "Some examples are:\nPair share.",
        "Ask a question related to the reading.",
        "Pair up your students for a quick discussion about their answer.",

        "Making Reading Fun Introduce the book in a fun way.",
        "You could play a game related to the book, watch a clip from a movie, or do an artistic project.",
        "Choose any fun way to get your student(s) excited about the book.",
        "Some books may be easy to match with an activity, such as one that's already been made into a movie, while others may take some thought.",
        "For example, you could show them a clip from the movie Bridge to Terabithia before assigning the book.",
        "Similarly, you could introduce a Sherlock Holmes book by playing a mystery game.",
        "Assign some of your favorites.",
        "Pick out books that really grabbed your attention as a child or teenager.",
        "Enthusiasm is contagious.",

        "Check out the school library or your local public library for books on tape or CD.",
        "Look for free downloadable versions of classics at Librivox.org.",
        "Audio books can fire up interest in reading.",

        "Students will more likely engage with the material if they can see how it relates to the real world.",
        "Think of a variety of interesting activities that could make this connection.",
        "You could:\nHave students connect the reading to something in their lives.",
        "For example, you could ask them if they know a stubborn person like the narrator in Green Eggs and Ham.",
        "Assign students to act out scenes or from their reading.",
        "Plan a field trip on a related topic or theme to their assigned reading.",
        "Hold contests.",

        "Keep a weekly book quota to help students stay on track.",
        "Give them small prizes for the books they read.",

        "Play solo or group games.",
        "Search websites like PBS Kids or RIF.org to find fun games appropriate for your students\u2019 reading levels.",
        "Look for games that you can either print out.",

        "Some examples are:\nMatching pictures to words or phrases that describe them.",
        "Writing a chain story.",
        "Break the class up into groups.",
        "Give each group an opening sentence.",
        "Each student builds on the previous sentence until they have a complete story.",
        "Playing a modified \u201cGo Fish\u201d game.",
        "The rules are the same as the traditional game.",
        "However, in this game, students match words,  rather than pictures."
