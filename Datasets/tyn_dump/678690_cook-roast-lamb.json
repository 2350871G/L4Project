Roasting the Lamb Roast the lamb for 30 minutes. Place the roasting pan in the oven and roast at a high temperature for half an hour. This will create a delicious crust around the leg of lamb.

Serving with Mint Sauce Whip up the mint sauce. Mix the mint, sugar, vinegar and water in a bowl. Use a whisk to whip the mixture until it's thoroughly incorporated. Arrange slices of roast lamb on a platter. Place the slices in an artful pattern on a single platter, or put a few pieces on the plates you'll be serving to people.
