This can help you make sure that you've got material for more than just the first few strips. If you're wanting to do more of a gag-a-day strip, you'll want to outline the types of jokes you want to make.

Of course, sticking to a particular size will matter most if you plan on publishing your comics in print (such as a newspaper). If you plan on having them online instead, don't worry about this as much. If you're printing and even if you're not, it's best to at least keep the same width and height for a single row. So, you can have one strip with one row, and another strip with two rows, but all three rows should be the same width and height as each other."
