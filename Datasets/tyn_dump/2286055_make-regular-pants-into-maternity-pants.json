    "text": " Cutting your Pants Try on the jeans or pants that you want to use. Zip them up to the point at which they can comfortably close without pinching your belly. Mark that point on the front of your pants with a fabric pen.  Draw a curve that dips from just under your side belt loops down to the marked point on your zipper. You should have a very gentle curve that may cut through your front pockets. Cut along the curve with fabric scissors, once you are satisfied that the curve is even on both sides.  Cut across the back of the pants, just under the belt loops. Your back pockets, if you have them, should stay intact. Ready your sewing machine to stitch right below the cut you just made. This will prevent fraying. Load some thread that is the same color as your pants. If you are converting jeans, then consider using a size 100 jeans needle and very strong thread. Some craft stores sell thread that is specially made for sewing on denim. Stitch once along the entire cut edge, using a straight stitch. Then, stitch 1 more time across the zipper and fly region. Creating your Maternity Waist Band Cut a long band of elastic. You should use elastic that is 2 inches (5 cm) or wider so that it does not dig into your belly. Try on the pants again. Wrap the elastic around your waist, at top edge of your pants, where they meet your pelvic bones. Mark a length on the band that is comfortable and not too tight. Remember that you want the elastic to be tight enough to keep the pants on, but also allow a little room for growth. Pin the elastic band together at the point that you marked with your fabric pen. Cut off excess any excess elastic. Sew the ends of the elastic band together. Choose a 4-way stretch knit fabric or tight t-shirt to use for the section of the bands that will fit over your stomach. You may want to choose black, blue or another color to match your pants or a patterned fabric that will create some attractive contrast. You will need at least 1/4 of a yard for the fabric waistband. A Lycra/cotton blend will work well. If you buy a length of knit fabric, ensure that it is fairly elastic, so that it does not stretch too far. If you choose a t-shirt, find 1 that fits snugly over your belly. You can cut a horizontal section of the shirt to use as your waist band. Measure your elastic band with a fabric measuring tape. Subtract 2 inches (5 cm) from that measurement. This is your width measurement for your fabric waist band. Cut a length of knit or t-shirt material that is equal to the width measurement. Cut it so that it is between 14 and 17 inches (35.6 to 43.2 cm) tall. If you have a short torso, choose a 14 inch (35.6 cm) measurement, and use a longer measurement if you have a long torso. Pin the ends of the fabric together to form a loop, as if you are trying to make a tube top. Sew the side together on your sewing machine. Fold the fabric tube in half so that the back sides are touching. The new seam should be folded in half and you should have both rough edges at the bottom and the fold at the top. Measure a casing for your elastic. Depending upon the width of your elastic band, you will need to measure the width plus 5/8 inches (1.6 cm). For example, if you have a 2 inch (5 cm) elastic band, then measure 2 and 5/8 inches (6.6 cm) up from the rough edge. Mark the measurement with a fabric pen or piece of chalk. Mark the measurement around the entire fabric loop. Sew along that line using a zig zag stitch. This will allow you to stretch the fabric when you pull your pants on and off. You want to sew between 2 layers of folded fabric, but be sure not to sew through both sides of the loop. Insert your elastic loop into the bottom of the fabric loop. It should stop at the line you have just sewn. Sew a seam just below the elastic band around the entire tube. Use a zig zag stitch again. This will close your casing for the elastic band. Sewing your Maternity Pants Lay your pants out on a table. Fold the fabric loop so that it is inside out. Pull it over the top of the pants until the edges of the fabric tube and the pants meet. Pin the edges together. The right, outside, sides should be touching. Sew a seam through the fabric and pants at the top twice. Use a narrow zig zag stitch. You may also choose to serge the final seam to prevent fraying. Unfold the fabric and try on your homemade maternity pants. You can either wear them with the fabric tube extending up your belly or with it folded in half.",
