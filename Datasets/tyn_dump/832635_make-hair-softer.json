Figure out what your hair type is and try to choose products that will improve the quality of your hair. If you can, go for all-natural or organic products as these will be less damaging to your hair. Your hair type may be fine, oily, dry, thick, coarse, etc. There are shampoos for every type of hair, so explore different products and find what works best for you. There are also shampoos and conditioners that increase the natural shine and smoothness of your hair, so you may try out one of those to help you achieve softer, smoother hair. Try to avoid shampoos and conditioners with sulfate as this can suck moisture out of your hair. Search for hair products that have hydrolyzed proteins, which make strands stronger and healthier over time."

However, washing your hair too much can be bad for your hair because it strips your hair of the natural oils it needs and doesn't leave much time for the oils to be restored. Try washing your hair every other day or every 3 days to allow the natural oils and shine to return. If you are worried about your hair looking greasy or oily, you can always use dry shampoo on your roots. Simply apply the spray and rub it in gently with your fingertips. Baby powder is a great product for this as well. Wearing your hair up on the second day is always a good idea too, because it may be harder to style down. If you have always washed your hair daily, it may take your hair some time to get used to the exposed oils. You may experience very oily hair at first, but after a few weeks, your hair will naturally produce less oil between washes. When you wash it daily, it's trying to make up for the oil lost so it produces it faster. Once your hair is used to going a few days without a wash, the oil production will slow down and become manageable."
