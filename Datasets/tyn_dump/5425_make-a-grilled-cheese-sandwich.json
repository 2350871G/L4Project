    "text": " Preparing a Classic Grilled Cheese Butter a single side on 2 slices of bread. Pick your favorite type of bread for your sandwich and take 2 slices from the loaf. Use room temperature butter so it\u2019s easier to spread and doesn\u2019t tear your bread. Coat a side of each piece of bread with the butter so it crisps up and doesn\u2019t burn when you put it in the pan. If you want to make your sandwich healthier, try using whole wheat, multigrain, sprouted, or gluten-free bread. Preheat a non-stick pan on your stove over medium heat. Set your non-stick pan on your stove and turn it on to high heat. Let the pan heat up completely before you put your sandwich on it so you get an even cook. Flick a few drops of water on the pan, and if they sizzle and evaporate right away, your pan\u2019s hot enough for the sandwich. Don\u2019t keep the heat too high on your stove or else it will burn the bread without melting the cheese. Assemble your sandwich in the pan. Once the pan is hot, place the first slice of bread into the pan buttered-side down. Top the piece of bread with 1-2 slices of your favorite cheese, then put the second slice of bread on top with the buttered side face-up. American cheese melts the easiest, but you can use any type of cheese you want for your sandwich. Try using or mixing different cheeses to change the flavor of your sandwich. Try using Cheddar, Provolone, Swiss, Gouda, or pepper jack for slightly different flavors. You may also use shredded cheese if you want it to melt faster. Cook the bottom slice of bread for 3-4 minutes or until it\u2019s golden brown. Let the bottom of the sandwich cook for 3-4 minutes so the bread gets crispy. Lift the sandwich with a spatula occasionally so you can check the color of the bottom slice. Be careful not to let the bread burn while it\u2019s cooking. Don\u2019t leave your sandwich unattended as it can burn or be a fire risk. Flip the sandwich and cook the other side for 2-3 minutes. Slide a spatula underneath the bottom slice of bread and quickly flip the sandwich over so the buttered side of the second slice is face down. Press down on the sandwich with your spatula to ensure the bread contacts the pan evenly. Let the sandwich cook for another few minutes or until the bread has turned golden brown and the cheese has melted. Be careful when you flip the sandwich since it can easily disassemble. Use your other hand to hold the bread in place as you flip it. Flip the sandwich over again if the first slice is undercooked so it can brown properly and crisp up. Cut the sandwich before serving it. Transfer the sandwich to a cutting board once it\u2019s finished cooking. Use a bread knife or paring knife to cut the sandwich diagonally to help it cool off as you eat it. Serve the sandwich while it\u2019s still hot. The cheese can be very hot, so take a small bite at first so you don\u2019t burn yourself. If you have leftovers, wrap them in foil or store them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 1 week. Cooking Grilled Cheese in the Oven Preheat your oven to 450 \u00b0F (232 \u00b0C) with the top rack in place. Check that one of the racks inside your oven is in the top position so your grilled cheese cooks thoroughly. Turn the oven on to 450 \u00b0F (232 \u00b0C) and let it heat completely while you prepare your sandwiches. Once the oven is up to temperature, you can cook your sandwiches. You can also use a toaster oven if you don\u2019t want to heat up your regular oven. Butter your slices of bread on 1 side. Choose your favorite type of bread to use for your sandwich. Use 2 slices of the bread and spread room temperature butter on 1 side of each slice. Spread the butter to the edges of the slice to help get even browning and prevent them from burning. Soften the butter if you don\u2019t have any at room temperature so you don\u2019t rip pieces off of your bread. Alternatively, you can spread mayonnaise on your bread instead of butter. Lay your slices of bread on a baking sheet butter-side down. Use a rimmed baking sheet large enough so you can place the slices of bread about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart. Lay the slices of bread so the buttered sides are face down on the tray so they can get crispy. You can also use a flat baking sheet if you don\u2019t have one with a rim, but the butter could drip into your oven as it melts.Tip: Cover the baking sheet in aluminum foil so you don\u2019t have to clean it afterward. Remove the aluminum foil when it cools off and throw it away. Put 1-2 slices of cheese on top of your bread. Choose your favorite cheese to use for your sandwich, such as American, Cheddar, or Provolone. Place 1-2 slices of cheese on top of each piece of bread so they don\u2019t overhang the edges, or else they could drip off of your sandwich. Try other cheeses, such as mozzarella, Swiss, or Gouda for different flavors. You can put cheese on only 1 slice of bread if you don\u2019t want your sandwich to be as greasy. Cook the slices for 4-5 minutes or until the cheese starts bubbling. Put the baking sheet on the top rack of your oven and set a 4- or 5-minute timer. Check on the bread and cheese occasionally to make sure they aren\u2019t burning. After 4-5 minutes, the cheese will start melting and bubbling on your sandwich. Pull the tray out to assemble the sandwich. Take the tray out of your oven so you can put the sandwich together. Use a spatula to pick up one of the bread slices and flip it upside down on top of the other slice. Make sure the edges of the bread line up with one another so none of your cheese drips off. Don\u2019t turn your oven off yet since you still need to keep cooking the sandwich. The baking tray will be extremely hot so wear an oven mitt while you\u2019re handling it. Return the sandwich to the oven for 3-4 minutes to crisp the bread. Put the baking tray back inside your oven for another 2-3 minutes so the bread gets crispy and turns golden brown. Take the sandwich out once it\u2019s finished and let it cool slightly before serving it. The bread and cheese will be hot when you take it out of the oven, so be careful so you don\u2019t accidentally burn yourself. You don\u2019t need to put the sandwich back in your oven if the bread\u2019s already golden brown and crispy when you assemble it. Store leftovers in an airtight container in your fridge for up to 1 week. Making Grilled Cheese in a Toaster Turn your toaster on its side so you can slide bread in horizontally. The cheese won\u2019t melt on your bread if the toaster\u2019s still upright while you cook it. Carefully tilt your toaster on its side so the slots face horizontally rather than vertically. That way, the cheese will melt on top of the bread without falling off. If you can\u2019t turn your toaster sideways, you can purchase toaster bags online to make your sandwich while the toaster\u2019s still upright. Put slices of bread with 1 slice of cheese each into the slots on your toaster. Set a piece of cheese on each of your bread slices before you put them in the toaster. Carefully slide the bread and cheese sideways into the slots of the toaster. Make sure the cheese doesn\u2019t fall off the bread when you insert it. Don\u2019t use bread that\u2019s too thick since it may not fit in your toaster. American cheese will melt the best in your toaster, but you can use any type of cheese.Warning: Check that the cheese doesn\u2019t hang over the sides of the bread slices since it could drip inside your toaster and create a fire hazard. Toast the bread and cheese for 3-4 minutes before unplugging your toaster. Set your toaster to cook for about 5 minutes and pull the lever down to start toasting your sandwich. After 3-4 minutes, unplug your toaster so it doesn\u2019t pop, or else it may shoot your bread onto your counter and make a mess. Never leave your toaster unattended while you make grilled cheese since it could create a fire hazard if you don\u2019t turn it off. Pull the slices out of the toaster to assemble your sandwich. Slowly pull the lever back up so it\u2019s easier to pull out the pieces of bread. Use a plastic spatula or fork to pull the bread out from the slots. Put the pieces of bread together to make your sandwich and serve it while it\u2019s hot. Never insert a metal object inside your toaster, even when it\u2019s unplugged. If your bread isn\u2019t crispy or the cheese hasn\u2019t melted, toast it for another 1-2 minutes. Keep any leftovers sealed in the fridge for up to a week. Putting Grilled Cheese in a Microwave Toast the bread in a toaster so it gets crispy. Put 2 slices of the bread you want to use in your toaster and cook them for about 3-4 minutes or until they\u2019re golden brown. Pull the bread out of your toaster once it\u2019s finished so you can use it for your sandwich. You don\u2019t have to toast the bread if you don\u2019t want to, but your sandwich won\u2019t be crispy. Put 1-2 slices of cheese between the pieces of bread. Choose your favorite kind of cheese to use for your sandwich. Set 1-2 thin slices of cheese on top of one of your pieces of bread, and then set the second piece on top to make your sandwich. American cheese will melt the easiest in your microwave, but any cheese will work for your sandwich. Wrap the sandwich in a paper towel so the cheese melts better. Set the sandwich on a piece of paper towel and wrap it up completely. The paper towel will help trap the heat so the cheese melts faster without making your bread soggy. Set the wrapped sandwich on a plate so it\u2019s ready to cook. Cook the sandwich in the microwave for 15-20 seconds or until the cheese melts. Set the sandwich in the middle of the microwave and run it in 15-20 increments. When the microwave\u2019s finished running, unwrap your sandwich and check if the cheese has melted. If not, put it back in your microwave for another 15 seconds. Otherwise, unwrap your sandwich completely and serve it. The bread may get soggier the longer it\u2019s in the microwave. Keep any leftover sandwich in an airtight container in the fridge for 1 week. Trying Grilled Cheese Variations Try putting tomatoes in your sandwich to add a fresh flavor. Cut 2-3 fresh slices of tomato and put them on top of the cheese when you make your sandwich. Cook your sandwich normally so the cheese melts around the tomato. Season your sandwich with fresh basil to make the sandwich taste fresh. Try using mozzarella cheese to make a grilled cheese that tastes like pizza. You can also use diced tomatoes if you want to ensure you have some in every bite. Add apple slices to your grilled cheese for a sweet and salty sandwich. Cut your apple slices so they\u2019re about \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) thick so they can heat evenly. Lay the apples on top of the cheese in the middle of your sandwich and cook the sandwich as you normally would. The cheese and apples will cook together to make sweet and salty flavors. Try using cheddar, brie, or Gouda in your apple grilled cheese to make the flavors stronger.Tip: Avoid using sour apples in your sandwich since it may not taste good with the cheese. Make a ham and cheese sandwich to add extra protein. Put a few slices of thin-sliced ham on the bottom piece of bread and then put your cheese on top of it. Cook your sandwich as normal until the cheese melts and the meat is hot. When you finish cooking the sandwich, cut it in half so it can cool down. Try using cheddar or Swiss cheese for a classic sandwich pairing. You can use other types of deli meat if you want, such as turkey or roast beef. Include tomatoes or pickles on your sandwich to add more flavors to your sandwich. Spread pesto on one of your bread slices to make an Italian-style sandwich. Before you put the top piece of bread on your sandwich, spread a thin layer of pesto on the unbuttered side. Cook the sandwich completely until the bread\u2019s golden brown and the cheese has melted. You can either make your own pesto or buy some from your local supermarket. Try making the sandwich with mozzarella cheese for a different flavor. Pair your grilled cheese with tomato soup for a classic meal or bump it up a notch with roasted red pepper/tomato soup. Heat the soup up on your stove or in the microwave and serve it in a bowl with your grilled cheese. Try dipping the grilled cheese in the soup before you take a bite to combine the flavors. You can either make your own soup or make it from a can or box.",
