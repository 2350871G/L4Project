        "Pull out the substrate and jar or tube provided in your kit.",
        "Remove the lid from the container and open the substrate package.",
        "Then, carefully drop the substrate into the jar or tube.",
        "Kits may provide different types of substrate.",
        "You might receive grains, soil, or ground up insect larvae.",
        "Add the cordyceps spores or inoculation liquid to the substrate.",
        "Read your kit\u2019s instructions for inserting the spores or liquid into the substrate.",
        "Open the cordyceps spores or inoculation liquid that came in your kit.",
        "Then, spread the spores or inoculation liquid over the substrate.",
        "Always follow the instructions that came with your kit so you\u2019re more likely to get the results you expect.",
        "Cover and shake the container to mix the cordyceps into the substrate.",
        "Put the lid back on the jar or tube that came with your kit.",
        "Then, shake the container for 3-5 minutes to combine the cordyceps spores or inoculating fluid with the substrate.",
        "If your kit\u2019s instructions have different instructions, always follow them to make sure your spores or inoculating fluid are properly mixed into the substrate.",
        "Tending the Cordyceps Give the substrate continuous light and 70-80% humidity.",
        "Place the jar or tube under a grow light or lamp.",
        "Then, place a humidity meter on the container or nearby to monitor the room humidity.",
        "If you need to raise the humidity, spray the container with water.",
        "If the humidity is too high, turn on a dehumidifier to reduce it.",
        "You can purchase a humidity meter online, at a pet store, or at a gardening store.",
        "You can purchase a dehumidifier at a department store, home improvement store, or online.Variation: Some experts recommend alternating between light and darkness.",
        "Instead of giving your cordyceps continuous light, turn on the light for 16 hours and provide 8 hours of darkness.",
        "Keep the container at 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) so the cordyceps can grow.",
        "Place a thermometer near the jar or tube so you can monitor the temperature.",
        "Then, set the room temperature at around 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) if possible.",
        "To cool the area, turn on a fan and aim it at your plant.",
        "If it\u2019s too cold, use a heat lamp or small space heater to warm the area around your container.",
        "The temperature is very important for growing cordyceps.",
        "Make sure it stays within a few degrees of 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F).",
        "Otherwise, your crop may not grow or could be stunted.",
        "Allow your cordyceps to incubate for 60 days.",
        "Leave your cordyceps undisturbed while they\u2019re growing.",
        "You will likely notice sprouts within 2 weeks of planting your cordyceps.",
        "Expect them to reach their full maturity in about 60 days.",
        "It\u2019s okay to occasionally spray your cordyceps with water if you live in a low humidity area.",
        "Otherwise, don\u2019t worry about tending to them.",
        "Harvest your cordyceps when they reach the top of the jar or after 60 days.",
        "Your cordyceps likely won\u2019t grow taller than the top of your jar, so pick them when they reach the lip of the jar.",
        "Some cordyceps won\u2019t reach the top of the jar, so go ahead and harvest them when they\u2019ve been growing for 60 days.",
        "Harvest them by plucking them from the substrate.",
        "Keep in mind that cordyceps won\u2019t have a second crop, so you don\u2019t need to worry about destroying the root systems.",
        "If you\u2019re using a kit, check the instructions to find out when the manufacturer recommends harvesting the cordyceps."
