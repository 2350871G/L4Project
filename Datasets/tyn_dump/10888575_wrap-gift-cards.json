This also helps the gift card to stand out if it will be sitting amongst other larger gifts. Putting the Gift Card in a Box Choose a small, shallow box with a lid. Select a box that has a similar size and shape to the gift card. Rectangular boxes generally fit best! Make sure that the box does not have excessive extra space inside so that the card will not slide around or even get lost inside. Line the box with a small sheet of tissue paper. Place the gift card inside and fold the excess tissue paper over top of the gift card so it is covered neatly, being careful not to wrinkle the paper. Put the lid on the box and seal it with some tape and a bow. Tape the box around the edges to secure the lid.

If your box already has an attached fixture to keep it shut, you can skip the tape and simply decorate with a bow. Putting the Gift Card in Bag Choose a small bag that matches the gift card\u2019s size. A small gift bag with an open top works well for a small but mighty presentation. Opt for a fun color or pattern that matches the interests of the recipient. Line the bag\u2019s interior with tissue paper and place the gift card inside. Layer paper at different angles to cover all sides of the bag\u2019s interior. Create a nesting space for the card to sit. Be careful not to wrinkle or tear the tissue paper when placing it inside the bag! Create a tissue paper topper for the bag. On a flat surface, fold another sheet of tissue paper into a triangle shape, then fold in half again. Pull the corner with no open ends and pinch or twist it tightly. On the opposite end, fluff the corners of the tissue paper upwards. This simple topper makes the contents of the bag appear abundant and full. It\u2019s the perfect big presentation for this small-sized gift! Decorate the gift bag with the tissue paper topper and bows. Place the tissue paper topper on top in the gift back, sticking out of the top. Put a bow or put other embellishments on the outside of the bag. Wrapping a Gift Card in an Envelope Choose an envelope that\u2019s the size of the card or slightly larger. Envelopes are sometimes provided for free or for a small charge at the store where the gift card was purchased. You can also make small paper envelopes or make a felt envelope for your cards. Place the gift card in the envelope. Make sure that the card is facing the back of the envelope so that the recipient will see what kind of gift card it is.
