If your recipe calls for a finely minced or chopped ingredient, pulse the blender a few times until it reaches the right consistency. For pureed foods, leave the blender on a little longer. Try pulsing carrots, garlic, and herbs in the blender to chop them. Puree your vegetables in the blender before adding them to a soup or a sauce for a perfectly smooth texture. If you're having a hard time blending firmer foods, like nuts, or fibrous foods like celery, make sure your blender blades are sharp. If you're not sure how to sharpen them, read the manufacturer's instructions."

Just place the food into a large, durable bowl and lower in the mixer, then turn it on. A mixer is especially helpful when you're combining a liquid mixture with a dry mixture, like for baked goods. You can also use a mixer to whip meringues, mayo, and homemade whipped cream. A hand-held immersion blender is perfect for blending homemade mayo or pesto, and its compact design will take up a lot less space in your kitchen than a food processor would. If you have a hook attachment, you can use your stand mixer to mix dough for bread, pies, and cookies."

While it may take a little longer, you can do the same work with a sharp chef's knife. Just place the food on a cutting board and carefully cut it into small pieces. The size of the pieces will depend on what you're chopping and what the recipe calls for. Garlic, onions, and celery can all be finely minced by hand, for instance. Of course, always remember to be careful when you're cutting anything with a knife. Hold the knife firmly in your dominant hand. With your other hand, curl your fingers in so they look like a bear claw, then use that claw to hold the food you're cutting. This way, even if the knife slips, it will just brush against the back of your knuckles. Tip: It often helps to cut your food into larger pieces first. Try slicing the ingredients in half, quarters, or slices before you start the fine knife-work."
