Let it sit for a while. Making the Bowler Hat Cover your workspace in extra newspaper and roll up your sleeves. This is messy work. Place the plastic bowler hat and cover it in strips. Be generous. Let the hat dry for a while. Consider removing the hat mold. If you only want papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 in your hat, take a pair scissors and make a cut in the plastic hat's shell. Make it small though.
