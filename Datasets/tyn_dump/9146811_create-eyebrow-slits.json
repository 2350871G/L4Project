Creating Eyebrow Slits with Makeup Fill in your eyebrows with eyebrow powder. First, use a spoolie or a brow comb and brush to shape your eyebrows and create more defined line and tame unruly hairs. Then, use an angled makeup brush and eyebrow powder to fill your eyebrows in and make them look thicker. Your eyebrow powder should match the shade of your eyebrow hair. The bolder and thicker your eyebrows, the more noticeable the eyebrow slits will be. Apply concealer around your eyebrows. Choose a concealer that matches your skin tone and apply it around the edges of your eyebrows.

Concealer will make the shade of your eyebrow slits match the shade of the skin tone around your eyebrows. You can use an applicator brush or your fingers to rub the concealer in. Dip a small detailing brush into your concealer. Select a small, flat, brush from your makeup kit and dip it into the same color concealer that you used around your brows. Cover the tip of the detailing brush in the concealer. Press the tip of the brush against your eyebrows. Choose where you want to create the slits and dab the detailing brush against your eyebrows so that you apply the concealer over your brows. Move the brush up and down to darken the line and try to keep the edges as clean as possible. Let the concealer dry for 5 minutes. Fan down the wet concealer to speed up the drying process. Don\u2019t move onto the next step until the concealer has dried. Apply translucent powder over your brows with a makeup brush. Use a fatter foundation brush and press it into a translucent makeup powder. Lightly dab the foundation brush over your eyebrow slits and around your eyebrows. This will make the slits look more natural and will help blend everything together. Blend the makeup on your face.
