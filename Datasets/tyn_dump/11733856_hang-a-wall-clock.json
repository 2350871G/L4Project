A hollow sound means that there is no stud, while a muffled sound means that there is. A stud will be much sturdier to drill into than just plain drywall. If you cannot find a stud in the area that you want to hang your clock, use piece of hardware called a screw anchor to hold your screw in place. This hardware looks like a large, hollowed-out screw, and you can find it at most hardware stores."
