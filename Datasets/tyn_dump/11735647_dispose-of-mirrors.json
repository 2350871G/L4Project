If you\u2019re worried about the mirror breaking in transit to the waste facility, wrap it in cardboard and duct tape the edges shut before throwing it out. You could also put a note on the front of your trash can with paper and a piece of tape that says something like, \u201ccontains glass,\u201d so that the sanitation workers know to be extra careful.Warning: Don\u2019t put your mirrors out with the recycling. Unfortunately, mirrors are extremely hard to recycle because the process is so different from that used to recycle glass. You can always check with your local recycling facility, but most programs ask you to keep mirrors out of the recycling."

The tape helps hold the glass in the mirror in place. It also covers up any sharp edges that may not be visible but that could still cut you. If the mirror has broken into multiple pieces, don\u2019t try to tape it back together.Warning: Always wear leather gloves if you\u2019re going to be touching a cracked or broken mirror.
