                    "description": "Before you start thinking of tightening your abs, you've got to work on shedding the fat above them. One of most important ways to do this is to make sure you keep a healthy diet. You don't have to count calories, but you should focus on eating three healthy meals a day and cutting down on foods that are high in fat and sugar. Here's how to do it:. Replace the foods you eat that are high in fat and sugar, like fast food, deep-fried food, and ice cream, with healthier foods, like frozen yogurt, meat, vegetables, and fruits. Choose high-protein foods like fish, poultry, lentils, and beans. If you're not burning enough fat by eating 3 healthy meals a day, try eating 4-5 smaller meals a day, which can help make you less hungry throughout the day. Don't skip meals. This will make you feel unbalanced and much more likely to binge eat. Tone down your alcohol intake. Alcohol is full of unnecessary calories that can be stored as fat."
