    "text": " Making a Cardboard Loom Use a utility knife or scissors to cut a rectangular piece of cardboard. This will serve as the base for your handmade loom. It can be any size you want. The larger the piece of cardboard, the larger your final piece of hemp cloth will be. Avoid using cardboard pieces that contain folds or creases because they may bend during weaving and ruin your loom. Draw a \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) border along the top and bottom edges. Use a ruler to measure a distance of \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) below the top edge of the cardboard piece and mark it with a pencil or marker. Draw a straight line along that mark, parallel with the top edge, to create a \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) border along the top. Repeat with the bottom edge of the cardboard. Mark notches every \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) along the top and bottom. Make the first vertical mark \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) in from the left edge. Then, using a ruler and a marker, draw a mark every \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) until you reach the right edge. Repeat this process with the bottom border. Double-check to make sure the bottom marks line up vertically with the top marks as you work. Make sure you mark an even number of notches. If you want to make the weaving easier, you can space the notches further apart. Just make sure they are evenly spaced. Cut a slit along each notch you drew, stopping at the border line. Using a pair of scissors or a utility knife, cut along each of the vertical lines you drew on the top and the bottom of the cardboard piece. The cut should start at the edge of the cardboard and stop at the \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) border you drew earlier.

However, the benefit of a handmade loom is that you determine how big your final piece of fabric will be, as well as how far apart your notches are positioned. Threading Your Loom Tape one end of the hemp yarn to the back of the cardboard. Flip your cardboard loom over so the back\u2014the side without the markings\u2014is facing up. Take your ball of hemp yarn and position the loose end of the yarn so it is directly below the first slit on the upper left side. Tape it in place. This yarn will only show at the top and bottom of your weaving. Consider using a neutral color like white or black. Thread the yarn through the upper left slit, then the bottom left one. Flip your cardboard loom over again so the front is facing up. Thread the yarn through the first slit on the top edge, then stretch it vertically down the loom and slide it through the first slit on the bottom edge. Pull the yarn up and over to thread it through the next slit along the top. At this point, you should see one vertical thread on the front of the loom and one diagonal thread on the back. Make sure you\u2019re pulling tight as you thread the yarn through the slits to avoid leaving any slack. Don\u2019t tug too roughly at the yarn, however, which can bend the cardboard and destroy your loom. Continue threading the yarn through the slits in the same pattern.

Once you\u2019ve threaded through all the notches, the yarn will be sticking out on the back side of the loom. Use a pair of scissors to snip the yarn and tape down the loose end to the back of the cardboard loom. Weaving on Your Loom Thread a piece of hemp yarn through a plastic embroidery needle. Cut the piece of yarn so it's 2 feet (0.61 m) long. Shorter pieces of yarn will be easier to work with at first, so you can also cut a smaller piece if you\u2019re a beginner. This yarn will be clearly visible in the final weaving, so select the color carefully. You will be able to switch yarn colors throughout the weaving. You may want to tie the yarn to the needle to keep it from sliding off during the process. Weave this yarn under the first warp on the left and over the second. Continue to weave the yarn under and over, under and over until you get to the far right side of the loom. This horizontal yarn is known as the weft. Once you\u2019ve finished weaving, pull the weft yarn through until there\u2019s a 3 inches (7.6 cm) tail on the left side. Loop the needle under the far right warp, then weave over and under. Go until you reach the left side. Pull the weft all the way through so there\u2019s no slack. Then, use your fingers like a comb to push the second row of weft down so it\u2019s wedged tightly against the first row. Don\u2019t pull too tight on the weft. You can tell you\u2019re pulling too much if the warp threads are being pulled to one side by the weft. Continue weaving back and forth until you run out of yarn. Stop when you don\u2019t have enough yarn left to complete an entire row of weft. Trim the yarn so there\u2019s a tail of about  3 inches (7.6 cm) sticking out the side. As you weave, make sure you continue to use your fingers to push the weft down so it\u2019s pressed tightly against the rest of the weft. Cut a new piece of hemp yarn and weave it under and over the weft. The yarn should be about 2 feet (0.61 m) long. It can be the same color as your last piece of yarn, or a different color if you want to create a striped pattern. Follow the same process you used to weave the first piece of yarn\u2014thread it through the needle, then weave it over and under, over and under the weft. Repeat this process until the loom is full. Trim any remaining weft yarn so there\u2019s a 3 inches (7.6 cm) tail sticking out one side. Removing Your Weaving from the Loom Thread the loose tails into the sides of your weaving. You\u2019ll be left with several tails of yarn sticking out either side of the weaving. Thread the first one onto your needle, then insert that needle into the top edge of your weaving. Push the needle through a section of the edge, then pull it out. You may be left with another small piece of yarn sticking out of the edge\u2014trim that with a pair of scissors. Repeat this process with each of the loose tails until the edges of your weaving are clean. Flip the loom over and cut the warp threads in the middle. You\u2019ll also want to remove the tape that\u2019s holding the two ends of the warp thread to the cardboard. Then, flip the cardboard loom over one more time so the weaving is facing up. Knot together the top left two warp yarns and repeat with each pair. Pull the top leftmost warp yarn from its cardboard slit. Do the same with the warp thread next to it. Double-knot these two pieces of yarn together. Then, do the same with the next pair of warp threads until you\u2019ve knotted the entire top of the loom. Then, repeat the process for the bottom edge.
