        "The turkey breasts should become a rich brown color after they've roasted at high heat.",
        "Keep in mind that the turkey itself will not have finished cooking by this point, but the skin will be golden brown.",
        "There's no need to check the internal temperature at this point since the turkey still needs to cook.",
        "Put the foil on the turkey breast.",
        "Once the turkey breasts are browned, open the oven door and very carefully place the greased foil onto the turkey breasts.",
        "Push the foil down so it's touching the skin.",
        "The foil will prevent the turkey breasts from drying out while the turkey finishes cooking.",
        "Roast the turkey at 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) for 2 to 2 1/2 hours.",
