If you have an existing headboard that is made out of metal or wood, consider painting it a different color. If you are using a canvas, you can paint it using stencils, a solid color, or ombre.

Adding a Canopy Gather your supplies: A canopy is a great way to add privacy or a dreamy effect to your bed. This section will show you how to make a simple ring-based canopy using an embroidery hoop, some ribbon, and a set of sheet curtains. Here's a list of what you will need:\n1 large embroidery hoop\nAcrylic paint (optional)\n1 set of sheer curtains\n1 ceiling screw hook Consider painting your embroidery hoop. Most of your hoop will be covered, but what shows from beneath the fabric may detract from the overall appearance. To paint the hoop, simply take it apart and paint both pieces using acrylic paint and a paintbrush or foam brush. You can also spray paint both pieces instead. Allow the paint to dry fully before proceeding. You can paint the hoop the same color as your fabric. This will make it less visible. You can also paint your hoop in a contrasting color. For example, if your fabric is white, then paint your hoop a bright color, such as teal or pink. Take apart the embroidery hoop if you have not already done so. Unscrew the hoop, and set both the screw and nut aside. Take the inner hoop out and set it aside as well. Slide both curtains onto the open outer hoop. The curtains should have a a casing along the top for the curtain rod; slide the hoop through those casings. Make sure that the wrong side of the fabric is facing the inside of the hoop. The right side of the fabric should be facing the outside of the hoop. Tie three pieces of ribbon to the inner hoop. Try to space them as evenly as you can. The ribbons need to be long enough so that when you hang the hoop from your ceiling, the bottom hem of the curtains brushes against your floor. You can also use clear fishing line instead. Tie the top ends of the three ribbons together in a tight knot. Make sure that each ribbon is the same length. If one ribbon is too long or too short, your canopy won't balance right. Slip the inner hoop inside the outer hoop. Move the curtains around on the ring so that they are evenly spaced. There should be no gaps. Close the outer hoop. Slip the screw back through the metal holes on the opening of your outer hoop. Place the nut on the end of the screw. Keep twisting the nut until the outer hoop is closed tightly around the inner hoop. Drill a hole into the ceiling and insert the hook. Some types of ceilings are very soft, and might need a plastic drywall screw first, in order to hold the hook. Hang the canopy from the hook and drape the curtains around your bed. The bottom hem of the curtains should be brushing against your floor. You can pull open the curtains at the front, and drape each panel over the left and right side of your bed. The back part of the curtains should rest behind your headboard. Making a Simple Headboard Gather your supplies: If you don't have a headboard, you can always make a simple one using some cardboard and colored fabric. This headboard my not last forever, but it is a great way to see what one may look like on your bed before you upgrade to a sturdier one made out of wood. Here's what you will need:\n2 pieces of cardboard that are wider than your bed\nGlue or strong tape\nBox cutter\nFabric\nScissors\nSpray adhesive\nHot glue (optional)\nWhite paint (optional) Tape or glue two large pieces of cardboard or foam board. If you are using tape, try to use strong packaging tape or duct tape. The double thickness of the cardboard will make your headboard sturdier. Consider painting the cardboard white if you are using a light-colored fabric. If you don't do this, the color of the cardboard may show through and make your fabric appear darker than it actually is. You can use white acrylic paint and a foam roller, or white spray paint. Be sure to let the paint dry before moving on. Sketch out the shape of the headboard. You can make it however tall you want, but it needs to be at least as wide as your bed. If it is narrower than your bed, it will look too small. If you are making a curved/fancy headboard, make a template on a piece of paper for just one side of the pattern. Trace the template onto the left side of the headboard. Flip the template over, then trace it on the right side of the headboard. This will ensure that your pattern is the same on both sides. Cut the headboard out using a box cutter. The box cutter may not go through all the layers in one go. If this happens, simply keep gong over the same area again and again until the box cutter goes through. Consider working over a cutting mat so that you do not ruin your table or floor. Be sure to move the mat as you work, so that it is always under where the knife is cutting. Spread some fabric out on your floor or table. Make sure that the wrong side of the fabric is facing you, and that there are no wrinkles. The fabric needs to be a few inches larger than your headboard all around. You will be folding the edges of the fabric over the headboard and gluing them to the back. If there are any wrinkles in the fabric, you will need to iron them out. Spray the fabric and cardboard with spray adhesive. Use straight, even strokes, and always go in the same direction. Try to overlap each stroke by a little to prevent any gaps. If you painted the cardboard white, then spray the side you painted; this is the side that will be sticking to the fabric. Consider covering your work surface with newspaper so that the spray adhesive doesn't get on it and make it sticky. Place the headboard glue-side down onto the fabric. Try to center it as much as possible, so the fabric boarder is the same width all around. If you made a curvy headboard, then trim the edges of the fabric down to match the curves; be sure to leave a few inches of seam allowance, of you won't be able to wrap the fabric around the headboard. Fold the edges of the fabric over onto the back of the headboard. Pull the fabric as taught as you can. If there is a curve, you will need to cut little slits into the edges first; this will help the fabric curve better. Hot glue the fabric to the back of the headboard, if necessary. The spray adhesive may not be strong enough to hold the fabric to the back of the headboard. If you see the fabric peeling up, you will need to glue it down. Apply the hot glue to the back of the headboard and press the fabric down onto it. Hot glue sets quickly, so only apply it \u00bd to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) at a time. Hang the headboard above your bed. Begin by poking two holes into the back of your headboard, one on each side; be careful not to poke through the fabric on the front of your headboard. The holes need to be level, or your headboard won't hang right. Then, attach two hooks onto your wall. The space between the two hooks should be the same as the space between the two holes in your headboard. Hang the headboard onto the hooks; the hooks should slide right into the holes you made. Be sure that the bottom of the headboard extends behind your mattress. Placing Pillows, Blankets, and Comforters Consider adding a bed skirt if you have a box-spring. Place a bed skirt over the box-spring and secure it around the top edges with upholstery twist pins. This will help keep the bed skirt in place. When you are finished, put your regular mattress back on top, right over the box-spring and bed skirt. Choose a color that compliments the rest of your room, or your bedding. The bed skirt can be simple and plain, pleated, or ruffled. It's up to you. Cover your mattress with a mattress protector and a fitted sheet. The mattress protector will keep your mattress clean, while the fitted sheet will give it a new look. You can use a solid-colored fitted sheet or a patterned one. Consider matching it to your bed skirt; this way, the two will blend together and appear as one piece. Place a flat sheet down onto your bed. Make sure that the top, finished edge is facing down against the mattress. You will be folding it over a blanket later. Drape a blanket over the top of the fitted sheet. If you live in a cooler climate, consider using a down comforter. Be sure to cover your comforter with a duvet cover to keep it clean. Duvet covers come in many different colors and patterns. Try using something that contrasts your fitted sheet. Fold the top edge of the fitted sheet over the blanket. This will create a nice band of color at the top of your blanket. Consider adding some decorative pillows against the headboard. You will need to take these off when you go to sleep, but they can give your bed that final, luxurious touch. They should be lined up next to each other, and leaning against the headboard. These can be large rectangular pillows, or large square pillows. Consider using something made from a fancy fabric, such as velvet or brocade. Place your regular pillows down in front of the decorative pillows. Be sure to place your pillows inside some decorative covers. If you can a more unified look, try to match the color or pattern of the decorative covers to your fitted sheet and flat sheet; most are sold as a set. Consider placing a small, decorative pillow in front of your regular pillows. Don't put too many, or your bed will start to look cluttered. You will only need one or two. Try experimenting with different shapes, such as round, square, or tube. Place a decorative throw or blanket at the foot of the bed. Fold the throw or blanket in half, so that it does not cover your entire bed.",
