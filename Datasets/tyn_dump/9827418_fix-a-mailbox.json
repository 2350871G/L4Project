For example, if your post is 60 inches (1.5 m) and the mailbox attaches directly to its top, dig a hole that\u2019s 19 to 24 inches (48 to 61 cm) deep. If the mailbox will sit on a support arm, measure 41 to 45 inches (100 to 110 cm) from the arm instead of from the top of the post.

Check with your national mail service's guidelines if you live outside of the US. Insert the post into the hole and make sure it\u2019s level. Set the post into the hole, and use a bubble level to make sure it\u2019s plumb. Throughout the process of filling the hole, check for levelness periodically, and make adjustments as necessary. Double check your product's instructions to see which side of the post should be inserted into the ground. Fill the hole about halfway with dirt. Try to keep the post in place as you shovel dirt back into the hole, or have a helper hold it to keep it level. Check for levelness after you\u2019ve filled the hole about halfway. Tamp the dirt, add more dirt, then tamp the ground again. Use a hand tamper, sledgehammer, or a long piece of scrap wood to pack the dirt tightly around the post. Once the dirt is packed, add another 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm), then tamp that layer. Repeat until you\u2019ve filled in and packed the hole. Remember to check the post for levelness and make adjustments as you fill and tamp the hole. Attach the mounting bracket and mailbox to the post. After you\u2019ve buried the post, screw on the mounting bracket. Then screw the mailbox onto the mounting bracket. If you\u2019re reusing your old mailbox, you can find universal mounting brackets online and at hardware stores. Line up the bracket\u2019s pre-drilled holes with the holes pre-drilled into the mailbox and post. Use 1 \u20444 inch (4.4 cm) galvanized deck screws to secure the bracket to the post, and \u20444 inch (1.9 cm) to attach the box to the bracket. If you bought a new post and mailbox together, follow the manufacturer\u2019s installation instructions. Securing a Post with Concrete Make sure your local government and HOA allow concrete supports. Some cities and homeowners associations prohibit the use of concrete to support mailbox posts. Before starting your project, check your city government's website or call a local buildings inspector. If applicable, check with your HOA, too. Purchase a new weather-resistant post. Find a pressure-treated wood, PVC, or hollow metal mailbox post online or at a home improvement store. Simple posts are just 5 to 7 foot (1.5 to 2.1 m) lengths of 4x4 wood or PVC. If you go with a more elaborate, decorative option, you\u2019ll need to attach the base to a standard 4x4, then mount the 4x4 in the ground. Keep in mind the 4x4 is usually sold separately. Avoid posts made of unyielding materials, such as concrete or solid metal, which could be illegal in your jurisdiction. Dig a hole for the new post that complies with USPS guidelines. The hole should be around 1 foot (30 cm) in diameter so you\u2019ll have room to add the concrete after placing the post in the hole. Measure the post to find how deep you should dig in order to comply with USPS guidelines. The USPS advises burying a mailbox post up to 2 feet (61 cm) deep. The bottom of the mailbox\u2019s opening must sit 41 to 45 inches (100 to 110 cm) above ground level. Additionally, the opening should be 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) from the curb. Check with your national mail service's guidelines if you live outside of the US. Add 6 inches (15 cm) of gravel to the hole. Add the layer of gravel after digging the hole to the correct depth. Adding gravel or small stones before pouring concrete will help water drain properly. Mix the concrete according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Purchase a concrete mix at your local hardware store. Pour it into a wheelbarrow or concrete tray, add water as directed, then mix it until it\u2019s about as thick as peanut butter. The precise ratios vary by manufacturer, so use the amount of water listed in the instructions. Purchase 2 50 pound (23 kg) bags of concrete mix to fill a 10 inch (25 cm) diameter hole that\u2019s 2 feet (61 cm) deep. Set the post in the hole and ensure it\u2019s level. Insert the post into the hole, and use a bubble level to make sure it\u2019s plumb. Check for levelness periodically as you fill the hole with concrete, and make minor adjustments as necessary. You could also have a helper hold the post in place and check for levelness as you pour the concrete. Add concrete to within 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) of ground level. Use a shovel or trowel to fill the hole with concrete. Instead of filling the hole all the way to the top, leave a little room between the top of the concrete and ground level. If you leave a little room, you can fill in the space with dirt or gravel after the concrete sets. Dirt or gravel will look better than bare concrete. Allow the concrete to set as directed. The set time depends on your product, and could be from 30 minutes to several hours. Be sure to check the post for levelness before the concrete begins to set. Cover the concrete with dirt or gravel after it has set. After allowing the concrete to set as directed, disguise it with a layer of dirt or gravel. Fill in the 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) of space you left between the top of the concrete and ground level. Attach the mailbox and mounting bracket. Line up the mounting bracket\u2019s pre-drilled holes with the post\u2019s holes, then secure them with 1 \u20444 inch (4.4 cm) galvanized deck screws. Align the bracket with the mailbox, and drive \u20444 inch (1.9 cm) screws through their pre-drilled holes to complete installation. If you\u2019re reusing your old mailbox, purchase a universal mounting bracket online or at a hardware store.",
