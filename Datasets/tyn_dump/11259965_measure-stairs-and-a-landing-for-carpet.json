Adding up the Stair Measurements Measure the width of the stairs with a measuring tape. Stretch out the measuring tape parallel to the edge of a stair to get the width. This number tells you how wide the carpet needs to be to cover the stairs. Do this for 2-3 stairs in case there are any variations in width.
