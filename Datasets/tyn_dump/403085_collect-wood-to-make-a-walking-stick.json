An ideal walking stick should be stiff, and living wood may at first be too flexible. In addition, taking wood from a living forest may be environmentally damaging or even illegal in some locations. The wood from dead Aspen trees make beautiful smooth walking sticks."

Do not go to your local park and start cutting away. There are laws against damaging public property. In some places it is considered vandalism (exception: you might get permission to trim away a dead branch). Find a forest or heavy wooded area. Be respectful of other people's rights. If you are in a fenced-in area, a lot or behind some one's  home be careful. Do not trespass. Consider what may happen if you are reported. Get permission first! Some species of trees are protected. If taking wood from a live tree, try to collect only a dead branch, or one that is low enough to be a nuisance to persons walking nearby. Take from an area that could tolerate some thinning-- in fact, thinning even promotes growth of the saplings that are not collected. If possible leave a portion of the sapling with at least one branch with leaves."
