The revenue recognition principle requires accountants to show revenues on the income statement in the period in which they are earned, not in the period when the cash is collected. This requires a differentiation between realized and earned revenue. Realized revenue is revenue received regardless of whether the company has fulfilled its obligations to the purchaser. Realized yet unearned revenue is the subset of revenue which must be deferred. For instance, say a magazine company receives a twelve-month subscription for a monthly publication. The subscription costs $120, and the subscriber pays the entire cost of the subscription up front. Thus, before the company delivers any magazines to the customer, the $120 is classified as deferred revenue and represents a liability to the company. In other words, the revenue has been realized but not yet earned."

    "text": " Determining What Revenue to Defer Familiarize yourself with the accrual basis of accounting. Deferred revenue is an aspect of what is called the accrual basis of accounting. Under the accrual basis of accounting, revenues are recorded on the income statement when they are earned rather than received. This contrasts with the cash basis of accounting wherein the opposite is true. Understand why you need to defer revenue. Accrual-based accounting requires you to defer unearned revenue because of a principle called the revenue recognition principle. The revenue recognition principle requires accountants to show revenues on the income statement in the period in which they are earned, not in the period when the cash is collected. This requires a differentiation between realized and earned revenue. Realized revenue is revenue received regardless of whether the company has fulfilled its obligations to the purchaser.

This includes items that have been paid in full but await shipment, as well as subscription-based revenues where the subscription period is still ongoing. Once these transactions have been identified, the accounting staff must calculate and record the amount of the deferral. Recording Deferred Revenue Record the deferred revenue. Recording deferred revenue applies to the company\u2019s balance sheet. The company receives cash (an asset account on the balance sheet) and records deferred revenue (a liability account on the balance sheet). In the example from Part 1, the company receives a $120 advance payment relating to a twelve-month magazine subscription.
