        "If you broke a battery-powered circuit by disconnecting the wires, power will be restored to the circuit once you touch the black probe to the wire.",
        "If you turned off the power with a breaker or a switch, turn it back on.",
        "This will be the other end of the wire you cut or disconnected from the power supply.",
        "If you're testing in a car, don't start the car, and don't try to turn on any fans, lights, or anything else in the vehicle, as you could overload the meter.",
        "Leave the probes in place for about a minute as you read the meter.",
        "Once the meter is in place, you should see a number on the digital display immediately.",
        "This is the measurement of your current, or amperage.",
        "Although this initial reading may be accurate, for the most precise measurement, leave the probes on the circuit for at least 60 seconds to ensure the current is steady.",
        "If the reading is less than the sensitive setting (for instance, if it reads less than 0.3 A and the sensitive setting measures up to 300 mA), disconnect the meter, move the red probe to mA, and repeat the test."
