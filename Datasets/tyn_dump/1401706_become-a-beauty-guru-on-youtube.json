You can never go wrong with using your first name and then something that describes your channel, such as BeautyByRachel or TiffanyNails. Avoid long strings of numbers. This looks unprofessional and isn't easy to remember. Avoid being silly. If you want guru status, you need to be taken seriously. Jazz up your channel page. Add a nice background, for example. There are many programs that you can use to do this. Remember, don't overdo it- just chose something that best describes you. A good way to get views is to set the video on your channel to autoplay. Learning from Existing Beauty Gurus Start subscribing to other gurus. Watching other gurus' videos is a great way to learn about what types of videos are successful. Obviously, don't copy what they're doing. Use their examples to inspire your own unique take on presenting your videos and content. Don't worry about making your first video completely perfect, just like professional Youtubers. Just remember that they have been on YouTube for a long time, so they have lots of experience. Making Videos Start making videos. Plan your videos out ahead of time; if you don't, there is a risk you'll ramble on or fail to engage the audience.

Use a program such as iMovie (Mac) or Windows Movie Maker (PC). Try to make a new video every one to two weeks. Keeping things new and fresh is important and brings your viewers back frequently. Getting Viewers Tag your videos when you upload them, and fill in the description box. This is how new viewers will find your videos, because they will find them through searching YouTube. Use a descriptive title as well. So instead of \"My Hair Routine,\" use a title such as: \"My Curly Hair Styling Routine for Shiny, Defined Curls.\" Add your videos as 'Video Responses' to videos that are similar in topics and have lots of views.
