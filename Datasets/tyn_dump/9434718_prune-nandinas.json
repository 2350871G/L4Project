You will use bypass pruning shears on shoots that are thinner than \u20444 inch (1.9 cm). You will then need to switch to lopping shears for thicker branches. Both tools must be sharp in order to reduce wounding. You can purchase these in a hardware store or in a garden supply shop. Pruning the Nandina Make cuts in a staggered, step-like formation. Take a moment to look at your nandina and visualize where you want to cut. This will help keep you more organized in the future. The most visually-appealing formation for nandinas is the \"stair-step\" formation, where you cut the outer stems shorter than the central ones. It will also help with the formation of new shoots. Prune the oldest or weakest branches first. Find the tallest, oldest branches on your nandina, and cut it down with your shears. Take a moment to locate any weak branches close to the ground, and cut them back as well. Do not prune more than a third of the stalks' lengths. Cut the stems in one-third lengths for a fuller look. Prune the oldest, longest stems to a third of their length. Cut the next couple of stems down to half their length. Trim the rest of the stems to a quarter of their original length. Intermix cuts to give the bushes a fuller look. If you are working on an older plant, prune one-third of the old growth. Cut just above a branch or leaf node. This will allow new shoots to grow and prevent the plant from looking too bare. If you prune too far down the stem, the plant will look spindly and unappealing. Save some of the cut stems for floral arrangements, if desired. Many people find the combination of red berries and bright green leaves visually attractive.

Fertilizing the Nandina Fertilize the nandina after pruning. Fertilizing after pruning is recommended because it provides a needed dose of nutrients to the plant and helps it get ready for the upcoming growing season. Once you clear away the pruned stems and leaves, try to fertilize that same day, or within a couple of days. Trace a 12 in (30 cm) ring around the base of the plant. You can trace the ring into the soil with a stick or with your finger. Keep the edges of the ring 6 inches (15 cm) away from the base of the plant. This will serve as a placement guide for the fertilizer. Sprinkle a 10-30-10 granular fertilizer onto the traced ring. Don't worry if a few grains end up inside or outside the ring. You do not have to get it directly into the groove formed by the stick or your finger. If you can't get a 10-30-10 granular fertilizer, a rhododendron or evergreen fertilizer will do just fine. Water the fertilizer to a depth of 8 inches (20 cm). This means that if you were to dig down 8 inches (20 cm), the soil will be wet. If you do not water the plant deeply, then the fertilizer may damage the roots and kill it. How much water you use depends on how dry your soil is and how fast it absorbs water.",
