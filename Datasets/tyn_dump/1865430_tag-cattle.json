                    "description": "You can apply tags shortly after birth, during the calf\u2019s weaning period, or around the time that you begin branding young or fully-grown cows. The time that you choose will depend mostly on how operations are carried out on your farm or ranch. For some, tagging calves at birth may make it easier to keep up with them as they grow. Others may prefer not to bother with it until a cow is headed for auction. If you\u2019d rather not take on the task of tagging yourself, the officials at the feedlot or auction will usually be more than happy to do it for you. Some experienced ranchers recommend holding off on tagging until the calf no longer needs its mother\u2019s milk. Attempting to tag a newborn calf could disrupt its bond with its mother."

                    "description": "In order to tag a fully grown steer or heifer, it will first be necessary to safely restrict its movement. Attach a halter or nose ring to the cow and guide it into the chute. Once it\u2019s inside, tie the lead rope to 1 side of the gate tight enough to keep the cow from moving its head more than a couple inches (about 2.5-5 cm). A head gate typically isn\u2019t necessary for securing young calves. Simply lay the calf down on its side and hold it firmly yet gently. It may help to have an assistant on hand to help hold the calf still. Erratic movement could increase the risk of injury to either you or the cow, or result in a botched tagging that must be repeated."
