The dish should have enough water in it to completely cover the blender sponge. If there isn't enough water initially, simply add more as needed. As the sponge soaks, the water will likely begin to change color. Expect the water to take on a dingy beige or tan hue as it draws the foundation and other cosmetics out of the sponge.
