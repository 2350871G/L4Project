If your orchid is in a pot, you may need to tap or push around the sides of the pot to loosen the root ball. If your orchid is in the ground, dig out at least 10 inches (25 cm) away from the edge of the clump, so that you protect the roots. When pulling the plant out of its pot or the ground, hold onto the large mass of leaves near the base. Be careful not to break off the pseudobulbs by holding on to tightly, but use the greenery to get the plant out. If your orchid has roots growing out of the bottom of the pot, you can cut them off to get the pot off the plant. This will not hurt the plant."

In some cases, such as if the plant came out of the ground, this will be a lot of material. In other cases, such as if your plant has been in a pot for many years, there will be very little material because the roots will have taken up most of the room.Tip: If some of the roots get broken off at this point, don\u2019t fret.
