        "Don't overwater, as proper pawpaw growth requires well-drained soil.",
        "Brown, wilted leaves are a sign that you're overwatering.",
        "Cover the pot with a clear plastic bag after each watering.",
        "This will create a high level of humidity, which is ideal for seedling growth.",
        "But don't forget to poke holes in the top for ventilation.",
        "Place your pot in a sunny window or outside spot until your seed sprout.",
        "Pawpaws are sensitive to full sunlight for the first 1 to 2 years.",
        "Place your pot indoors near a window to filter sunlight, or outside in a spot that receives partial sunlight (meaning around 4 to 6 hours of direct sun per day).",
        "Germination should occur in 2 to 3 weeks, followed by taproot formation.",
        "After about 2 months, they will send up a shoot.",
        "At this point\u2014when your pawpaw seeds sprout\u2014you can move them into outside soil.",
        "Planting Your Seedlings Choose a planting spot with both shade and sunlight.",
        "Pawpaws grow best in warm to hot summers and mild to cold winters.",
        "Regions with a minimum of 32 inches (81 cm) of rainfall across the year are ideal.",
        "Remember\u2014young pawpaws may not survive in full sunlight.",
        "Pawpaws produce the most fruit in full sun.",
        "Plant your seedlings on the north side of a fence.",
        "This gives the pawpaws shade during its younger months and sunlight when they are mature and taller than the fence line.",
        "Another option is sowing your pawpaw seeds near a nitrogen-fixing tree (to its south).",
        "Not only will it provide your young pawpaw shade, it will also provide it with fertility.",
        "You can cut it down 2 to 3 years after, when your pawpaw is old enough that sunlight exposure doesn't cause sunburnt shoots and leaves.",
        "Transplant your seedlings in spring after bud break.",
        "The best time to transplant your potted pawpaws is right after bud break, which is when growth begins from the bud.",
        "Take care not to damage the root system, as they are typically very brittle.",
        "If you end up losing a significant amount of roots, prune the top of the plant to balance its size with the amount of remaining roots.",
        "Check that your soil's pH is between 5.5 to 7.",
        "Pawpaws prefer slightly acidic soil.",
        "Stick your soil pH meter into the soil\u2014if the pH is outside of the recommended range, use limestone to adjust it.",
        "If your soil has low levels of magnesium, the addition of dolomitic limestone can raise pH.",
        "If it has high levels of magnesium, calcitic limestone can raise pH.",
        "The addition of ground oyster shell, crushed eggshells, and wood ashes can also be used to adjust soil pH levels.",
        "Dig a hole and fill it with water to test soil drainage.",
        "Pawpaws require properly draining soil, ideally half air space and half solid soil, with approximately 2 to 5% organic matter.",
        "To test your soil, dig a hole 12 to 18 inches (30 to 46 cm) both across and deep.",
        "Fill it with water\u2014if it takes 1 hour or more to drain, your soil does not have proper drainage.",
        "Add organic matter into your soil to improve drainage.",
        "Manure, compost, or peat moss are great choices of organic matter that can improve soil drainage.",
        "Dig a hole with your spade as deep and wide as the root system.",
        "Matching the hole with the root system ensures that it has plenty of room to continue growing.",
        "Pawpaws have brittle roots, so be careful not to damage them.",
        "Space your pawpaw plants 8 feet (2.4 m) apart.",
        "Pawpaw trees should be spaced around 8 feet (2.4 m) apart, while trees in rows should be around 12 feet (3.7 m) apart.",
        "Any further and nutrient sharing between plants will be unlikely.",
        "If you're cross-pollinating, using at least 3 varieties of pawpaw is recommended.",
        "Plant your seedlings to the same soil depth as in the pot.",
        "Always plant into a depth equal to their potting depth.",
        "Use your spade to fill the hole back up with the topsoil.",
        "Place the soil around the roots and firmly press it down.",
        "Create a ring of leftover soil around the hole about 2 inches (5.1 cm) in height.",
        "This will help water soak into the soil.",
        "Caring for Your Pawpaws Water your plants regularly to maintain soil moisture.",
        "In addition to adequate soil moisture, you should also provide them with partial shade for the first 1 to 2 years.",
        "Once growth begins to accelerate, they don't require much care.",
        "Fertilize your pawpaws 2 times a year in March and June.",
        "Regular fertilization increases growth and fruit production.",
        "Use water or a rake to distribute the fertilizer throughout the soil.",
        "Avoid the 2 inch (5.1 cm) area by the tree trunk.",
        "Use fertilizer high in potassium.",
        "Don't fertilize after July 1\u2014this will promote later growth that can lead to freeze damage.",
        "Pollinate your pawpaws when they start to bloom.",
        "Using a paintbrush or something soft, rub a flower of one pawpaw tree to collect pollen.",
        "Then proceed to rub a flower of another tree.",
        "You cannot take pollen from one tree and use it on the same tree.",
        "Each individual flower will only accept pollen from a flower from a genetically distinct individual tree.",
        "If you're growing pawpaws outdoors, insects will pollinate your trees for you as long as you have 2 unrelated trees growing nearby.",
        "Monitor your pawpaw fruits and determine when they're ready for harvesting.",
        "Fruit production typically begins after trees reach 6 feet (1.8 m), which usually occurs after 5 to 7 years.",
        "Harvesting Your Pawpaw Fruits Squeeze potential fruits to test their ripeness.",
        "Using your thumb and forefinger, gently squeeze the fruits you believe are ripe.",
        "If it's still hard and doesn't give in to pressure, it needs more time.",
        "When the fruits turn a brownish yellow, they are usually ready to be picked.",
        "Picking pawpaws to early will cause unripe fruits to turn dark, but never soft.",
        "This prevents them from ever sweetening.",
        "Shake the pawpaw tree gently.",
        "The simplest way to test for ripe pawpaws is a gentle shake of the tree.",
        "Ripe fruits will fall to the ground, while fruits that need more time will stay attached to the tree.",
        "Pawpaws bruise readily, so skip this step if you're growing your fruits for market.",
        "Smell your pawpaws prior to eating them.",
        "Always smell your pawpaw fruits before you eat them.",
        "If they are ready, they will give off a strong smell akin to floral perfume.",
        "Any fruits that fail this test can be placed on your counter for ripening.",
        "Once the pawpaw aroma begins to fill the room, they're ready to eat.",
        "Refrigerate or freeze pawpaws that you want to preserve.",
        "Pawpaws can be placed in the refrigerator for several weeks.",
        "If you're going to be freezing them, they will last for a year or more."
