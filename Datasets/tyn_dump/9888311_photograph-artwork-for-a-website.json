DSLR cameras with removable lenses are great to use because they capture your images in high quality, and you can adjust the settings as you need to. While you can take decent images with point-and-shoot cameras and smartphones, they do not capture your images in high quality and resolution. If this is all you have, make sure you take your photos outside to capture as much detail as possible."

Choose days where most or all of the sun is blocked out by clouds. Harsh, direct lighting can create reflections, cast shadows, and change the colors. To take the most advantage of daylight, shoot around 2:00pm."
