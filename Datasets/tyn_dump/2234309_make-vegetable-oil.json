                    "description": "If you\u2019re just interested in making small amounts (e.g., around 2 cups (0.47 L) or less) of oil now and then, a manual oil press or oil expeller is a good option. These presses are hand-cranked and heated with a small kerosene or alcohol lamp. They typically come with a clamp that can be attached to your work surface (such as a table or counter). You can purchase oil presses online or from many home or kitchen supply stores. Manual oil presses tend to cost between $75 and $130 USD. You will need a separate container, such as a small glass jar, for catching the oil. Although these devices are often called \u201ccold presses,\u201d almost all forms of nuts and seeds require at least a small amount of heat (under 120 \u00b0F (49 \u00b0C)) to get them to release their oils."

Most presses can extract oil from nuts or seeds with an oil content of at least 25%. Good nuts and seeds for making oil include:\nSunflower seeds (be sure to use an oilseed variety). Pumpkin seeds (again, select oilseed pumpkins, which have shell-less seeds). Sesame seeds. Hazelnuts. Peanuts. Flaxseed. Safflower seeds. Pecans. Almonds. Walnuts."

Too much moisture in the seeds will prevent the oil from flowing properly during pressing. It may help your nuts or seeds dry more efficiently if you occasionally turn or stir them during the drying process. Another option is to dry the nuts or seeds on a screen propped up on supports (such as cinder blocks). This will allow air to circulate under the seeds as well as over them as they dry.

If you\u2019re using a hand-cranked press, you will need to light the heating lamp and let the press warm up for about 10 minutes before using it.

You will probably notice that your oil is cloudy or has particles floating in it. Letting the oil sit for a day will give these impurities time to settle to the bottom so that you can pour off the oil on top. Some electric presses have built-in filters.

Take care not to let any of the fragments or impurities at the bottom of the jar flow into the new container. Seal the container and place it out of direct light in a place with cool, consistent temperatures (such as a kitchen cabinet or pantry). With proper storage, your oil may stay fresh for up to 2 years as long as you keep it sealed. Some seed oils, such as sesame, hazelnut, and walnut oils, will keep best if you put them in the fridge. If you don\u2019t have an airtight container for storing your oil, use it within 2 to 3 days. If you notice that your oil has a strange smell, a stale taste, or a dark or cloudy appearance, then it may have gone bad. Dispose of any rancid oil or recycle it\u2014for example, you can use it as lamp oil or lubricant for squeaky hinges, or make it into soap."

Squeeze the cloth over a clean bowl or directly over a storage container, such as a glass bottle or jar. The avocado oil should be a rich, emerald green color. Store your oil in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a year. Put the oil in a container with an airtight lid or stopper, and store it away from light and heat. Avocado oil keeps best when stored in the refrigerator. Your avocado oil may become cloudy when it is chilled, but it should become clear again when it warms up to room temperature. If you don\u2019t have an airtight container, use your avocado oil within 2 or 3 days. Fresh avocado oil should have a subtle, nutty smell. If your oil has gone bad, it will develop a strong, rancid smell and an unpleasant taste. Extracting Oil from Coconut Milk Choose 3 or 4 mature coconuts. Look for mature brown coconuts rather than young green ones, since older coconuts have thicker flesh and can yield more milk. 3 to 4 coconuts will produce about 4 cups (0.95 L) of milk, which will yield about 1.8 ounces (51 g) of oil. You can buy whole coconuts at many grocery stores, or order them online. Remove the coconut meat from the shell. Break the hard shell of the coconut with a hammer or the back side of a heavy kitchen cleaver. Use a spoon or dull knife (such as a butter knife) to separate the meat inside from the shell. You can also buy specialized coconut knives that are designed to easily separate the meat from the shell. To avoid a mess, you may wish to puncture one of the eyes of the coconut and drain out the water before cracking the shell. Use a small knife to poke through the eye, or tap the tip of a screwdriver or a drill bit in with a hammer. Grate the coconut meat. Once the meat is extracted, use a grater to shred the meat. Grate the coconut over a bowl or directly onto a piece of muslin cloth to easily collect the shreds. For easier shredding and grating, you can purchase a coconut shredder online or at a kitchen supply store. Some models are designed to shred the meat directly out of the shell. Squeeze the milk from the meat through a muslin cloth. Pile the shredded coconut onto a square of muslin cloth and pull the edges together to create a bag. Hold the bundle over a bowl and squeeze the cloth tightly with your hands to extract the milk. Adding a splash of hot water to the shreds may help the milk flow out more easily. If there are any particles in the milk, place a second piece of muslin cloth over a clean bowl or jar and sieve the milk through the cloth. Simmer the milk over low heat for 2 to 3 hours. Pour the milk into a saucepan and place it on your stove on a simmer setting. Check the milk frequently and stir it to make sure it is not burning or sticking to the pot. Cook the milk uncovered until it turns slightly brown. To cook the coconut milk in a traditional Indian style, use a brass cooking pot called an urli. After the milk thickens and becomes light brown, remove it from the fire. Let it sit until it is cool enough to handle. Squeeze the cooked milk through a muslin cloth. Once the coconut milk is cooked and cooled, it should become thick and creamy. Pour or spoon it onto a muslin cloth over a bowl or jar. Fold the cloth into a bag or bundle and squeeze it to release the oil into the bowl. If you wish, you can squeeze the oil directly into a storage container. Store the oil in an airtight container for up to a year. Put your coconut oil in a container with an airtight lid, such as a bottle or storage jar. Keep it in a cool, dark area, such as your pantry or kitchen cabinet. Your coconut oil should stay good for about a year with proper storage. You can store your coconut oil in the refrigerator if you like, but it will become solid when it is chilled. You\u2019ll have to warm the container up to room temperature in order to easily get the oil out. Coconut oil that has gone bad may appear yellowish or chunky, and it may develop a bitter or sour odor and taste. It may also develop black spots if it becomes contaminated with mold.",
