Choose one of the avenues to find a job shadow opportunity. Ask a wedding planner that you know if you can job shadow them for a day or a week. If you have some open time in your schedule, you may request an unpaid or low-paid internship for a few months in order to learn the ropes. Look in the phone book or online  for local wedding planners. Although you may feel uncomfortable calling someone you don't know and asking to shadow them, you will develop contacts in the industry by doing so. Ask if they take on interns as well. Post an ad on Craigslist requesting an internship. If possible, take more than one internship to gain more contacts in the industry. Getting a job with a wedding planner is often easier by word of mouth than by job posting. Go to a mentor site, like PivotPlanet. This job search site allows you to sign up to speak with a wedding planner by web conference. You can set a number of dates to check in and ask questions about jobs, the industry and tips on getting started."
