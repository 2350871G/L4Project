        "Twisting your wrist, be sure to turn and shake the pan until all the sides are also covered in oatmeal.",
        "Place the pan inside your dutch oven.",
        "Using an oven mitt, remove the lids of the dutch oven and set them aside on a heat-proof surface.",
        "Carefully place your loaf pan in the center of the dutch oven, avoiding the hot sides.",
        "Make sure there is enough room on all sides of the pan for heat to surround it.",
        "Bake the bread.",
        "Using oven mitts, place both of the lids back on top of the dutch oven.",
        "Bake the bread for about 30 minutes.",
        "Check it after 20 minutes to see if it seems to be gaining a crust.",
        "The top of the bread will not brown, but it should no longer be soft and doughy once it is cooked.",
        "Place the bread on a cooling rack.",
        "Remove the lids and the pan from the dutch oven using oven mitts.",
        "Carefully shake the bread out of the pan.",
        "It should fall out easily because you floured your pan.",
        "The bottom of the bread will be significantly more cooked than the top.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a cooling rack, you can cool the bread on another heat-proof surface like a plate.",
        "Using a Haybox Start the baking process on the stove top.",
        "Place your dutch oven on the stovetop with the bread pan in place on your thermal ballast.",
        "Cover and heat on high for 15 minutes.",
        "Expect to have a few failed loaves which are under-cooked in the middle or over-cooked.",
        "If your equipment is different from that shown, your stove may provide more or less heat.",
        "Cooking time may need to be varied accordingly.",
        "Finish baking in your own version of a haybox.",
        "The idea of baking in a haybox is that enough heat has built up in the dutch oven.",
        "Completely surrounding the dutch oven with insulation will keep the heat from escaping and allow the bread to continue to bake.",
        "Remove the dutch oven from the stove using oven mitts.",
        "Instead of finishing the bread on the stove top, carefully cover the pot with insulating materials such as blankets or sweatshirts to create a haybox.",
        "Make sure to use a durable natural fabric like cotton.",
        "Synthetic material could melt from the heat of the pot.",
        "If it is a sunny day, place the haybox in the sun for a little added warmth.",
        "Leave the pot in the haybox for at least an hour.",
        "Three hours gives a better chance of success and cannot hurt the bread.",
        "When the time is up, or you just get too hungry to wait, uncover the pot carefully.",
        "Cut open a loaf and check to see if it is done baking all the way through the center.",
        "If it's overdone and dry or burnt, or underdone and doughy in the middle, make a note of it and adjust the stove top time accordingly the next time you try baking another loaf.",
        "If it's perfect, as shown here, enjoy the rewards.",
        "You have saved up to 80% of the fuel necessary to bake the same loaf in the oven.",
        "Baking Flatbread in a Skillet Make the dough.",
        "Stir 2 1/4 teaspoons of instant yeast and 2 teaspoons of sugar into 3/4 cup of warm water.",
        "Let this sit for 5 minutes, while you pour 2 cups of all-purpose flour and 1 teaspoon of salt in a large mixing bowl.",
        "Pour the other ingredients and 1 tablespoon of olive oil into the mixing bowl and mix thoroughly until there are no dry spots and the dough is sticky.",
        "Finish the dough.",
        "Move the dough from the bowl to a flat, floured surface and knead it for 10 minutes.",
        "Oil the bowl so the dough doesn\u2019t stick and put the dough back into the bowl.",
        "Cover the bowl and allow the dough to rest for 30 minutes.",
        "Shape the dough.",
        "Break the dough into 6 pieces.",
        "Roll each piece into a ball in the palm of your hand, then place it on a floured surface.",
        "Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a circle.",
        "It should be about 8 inches wide.",
        "Prepare your pan.",
        "Heat a skillet on the stove top.",
        "Set the heat to medium-high and allow the skillet to warm.",
        "A cast iron skillet would work best for dispersing the heat.",
        "If you don\u2019t own a cast iron skillet, you can use any pan.",
        "Coat the bottom of the pan with oil or butter.",
        "Bake the flatbread.",
        "Place one circle of the dough in the pan and bake for 30 seconds.",
        "Use a spatula to flip the bread.",
        "Cook the other side for 1.5 minutes, then flip again and cook the original side for another 1.5 minutes.",
        "Set the baked flatbread aside in a kitchen towel while you repeat this process with the other 5 circles of dough.",
        "The bread should puff up while it is baking.",
        "You want each side to have little brown spots cooked into them."
