This will allow you to make a bracelet that is long enough to wrap around your wrist. To speed up this process, use the first strand that was measured and cut as a basis for the rest of the string. Rather than measuring out 18 inches of each string, hold the previously cut strand to the remaining strings and cut them to be the same length.

Use the active color to create a chain of knots of a desired length. Typically, 15 knots will be done with each color, but this amount can be adjusted based on your preference for the desired length of that color block. As you are knotting, these knots will begin to spiral around the bundle of strings. This is as expected, so with each knot, pull the string in the direction that the spiral is moving in. Since this bracelet is composed of strictly left knots, tightly pull the active color up and to the left. If this bracelet is done with right knots instead, the spiral will be moving in the right direction instead. Switch colors when you're ready. After the desired length has been reached, switch colors by putting the now inactive color back in the bundle of strands, and removing a new active color to begin knotting with. Repeat this braiding process until your bracelet has reached the desired length. Once this length has been reached, tie a knot at the bottom of your completed bracelet pattern, to ensure that these knots will not unravel. Cut about 3 inches below the knot, so the strand lengths are all equivalent.  Tie the result around your wrist and your bracelet is complete! ",
