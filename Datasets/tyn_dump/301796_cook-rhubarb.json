    "text": " Cleaning Rhubarb Choose firm, healthy rhubarb stalks to cook. Inspect your rhubarb and throw away any stalks with large blemishes or bruising. These pieces are likely unhealthy and may have an unpleasant taste. Instead, choose healthy-looking stalks that are solid but snappable, which is an indication of freshness. Remove and discard all rhubarb leaves. Rhubarb leaves are poisonous and should not be consumed under any circumstances. Using a sharp cutting knife, remove the tops of your rhubarb stalks where the leaves emerge. Dispose of the leafy stem tops and prepare the remaining stalks for cooking. You can use rhubarb leaves as garden mulch or compost them. Rinse rhubarb under cool water and pat it dry. Before cooking it, wash your rhubarb in the sink under a stream of cool water. With your fingers, gently rub away any debris on the outside of the stalks. Pat them dry with a clean paper towel. Making Stewed Rhubarb Chop 6 cups (approximately 600 g) of rhubarb. Place clean rhubarb stalks on a cutting board. Chop the rhubarb stalks into 0.75\u20131 inch (1.9\u20132.5 cm) pieces. Measure out 6 cups  (approximately 600 g)  of rhubarb and put it into a large bowl. Add 1 cup (approximately 200 g) of sugar and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of water. After adding the sugar and water to the bowl containing the rhubarb, stir the mixture with a large spoon or spatula to combine the ingredients. As an optional seasoning, add a pinch of cinnamon to the mixture. Heat the mixture in a saucepan over medium-low heat for 15 minutes. Pour the contents of the bowl into a large saucepan and place it on the stove. Set the temperature to medium-low and let the rhubarb simmer for 15 minutes until the sugar dissolves and the rhubarb breaks down.

Do not serve your stewed rhubarb right away as it will be burning hot. Let the rhubarb sit until it cools to around room temperature or slightly warmer. Serve it over ice cream, cake, or other desserts. Roasting Rhubarb Cut about 1 pound (450 g) of rhubarb into pieces. After trimming and washing your rhubarb stalks, place them on a cutting board. Chop the rhubarb into 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) chunks. Place the pieces in a large bowl. For thinner pieces, try chopping your rhubarb on a diagonal.

Place it in the refrigerator for 2 hours or more to marinate. If the sugar is not dissolved after a few hours, try leaving it in the fridge overnight. Cover the dish with plastic wrap before refrigerating it. Cover the rhubarb and bake it for 20 minutes at 300 \u00b0F (149 \u00b0C). Preheat your oven then remove the rhubarb from the fridge and cover it with a piece of parchment paper. Bake it for 20 minutes, then check to see if it is cooked by removing it from the oven and piercing it with a fork. If the fork does not pierce the rhubarb easily, put it back in the oven in 5-minute increments until it is cooked through. Cool the rhubarb on a wire rack before serving it.
