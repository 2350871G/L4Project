Most of the time, these places will sell crowns (the uppermost part of the plant) or roots that are pre-cut and ready to plant. Most gardeners start horseradish from crowns, as the plant grows from the roots and only its weed-like flowers produce seeds. Like carrots or potatoes, horseradish roots are ready to go straight into the ground."

Horseradish takes roots quickly and flourishes in cool conditions, and it can quickly spread throughout your garden if you don\u2019t check its growth. Horseradish is a perennial, so plant it somewhere you'd like to have it growing for years to come. If you are working with a smaller garden, look into alternative planting methods such as terracing or using contained planting methods like a half barrel or Smart Pot."

This will allow the roots to radiate out beneath the soil while keeping the leaves of the crown vertical above ground. Fill the hole with a shovelful of compost to act as a fertilizer. Horseradish roots can be buried completely, or you can leave the top of the root visible to track its development."
