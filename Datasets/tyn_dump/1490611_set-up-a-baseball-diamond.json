Also make sure that the soil you shovel back into the hole is compact by adding only small amounts at a time and packing that in before shoveling in more. The top of each tube should be 1.5\u201d below the top of the hole. Lay a 2x4 over the hole and measure the distance between its bottom and the tubes\u2019 tops to double-check the distance before pouring concrete. Finish the batter\u2019s area. Remove the marked turf within your batter\u2019s area. Replace the turf with a mix of sand, clay, and silt. Then outline your batter\u2019s and catcher\u2019s boxes with chalk. Batter\u2019s boxes (for both left-handed and right-handed players) are 4 feet wide and 6 feet long for adults, while those in Little League are 3 feet wide and 6 feet long. Measure the boxes so their midpoints are even with that of home plate. Allow six inches of free space between each box and home plate. The catcher\u2019s box is 43 inches wide and 8 feet long for adults, and 25 inches wide and 8 feet long for Little League. Measure your box so that it\u2019s center is even with that of home plate. Create two foul lines. For each, begin your measurement from the back corner of home plate. From there, measure a distance of 325 feet along the outside of the square created by the baselines. At that distance, plant a pole marker. Then stretch a lining cord between the back corner of home plate and the pole marker. Chalk directly over the lining cord to create your foul line. Also an install a protective fence that extends 400 feet from home plate behind each foul line to shield spectators. Erect a backstop. Protect spectators behind the batter\u2019s area from missed pitches and stray balls. Install a backstop 60 feet behind home plate for adult players; for Little League, install it 25 feet behind home plate. Failing that, plant hedges instead to catch stray balls. Standard-sized backstops stand 30 to 40 feet high and measure 30 feet wide directly behind home plate, with 40-foot extensions running parallel with the baselines from either end. For a 30-foot height, dig foundation holes 2 feet in diameter and 7.5 feet deep for the supports. For a 40-foot height, make your holes 9.5 feet deep. Once they are placed inside each hole, secure the poles firmly in place by filling the hole with concrete.",
