You can also find it at the drugstore but you many have to hunt for it, because not all brands at the drugstore sell it. Do not use too much primer. Focus on making the primer go on in one thin layer. If you have sensitive eyes, do not use primer on your waterline. Your waterline is the line of eyelid between your eyes and your lashes.

        "If you apply eyeliner while the primer is still wet, you run the risk of the eyeliner smudging because it is being applied to a slippery surface.",
        "Set your primer.",
        "To make sure that the primer sets, dust your eyelid with a translucent or nude-colored powder.",
        "Do not use too much powder, as this will cause your makeup to crease.",
        "Instead, cover your lids with a thin layer of powder to allow the primer to set.",

        "Curl your lashes, then apply your eyelid primer and wait for it to dry.",
        "Once it's dry, set your eyelid primer with a bone-colored powder to create a base for the eyeliner.",
        "Applying Your Eyeliner Use cooled eyeliner.",
        "If you are using a pencil liner, consider putting your eyeliner in the fridge for 10 or so minutes if you notice it is soft.",
        "Eyeliner is made mostly of wax, and when wax is warm it melts and smudges.",
        "If you live in a warm climate or your eyeliner is above room temperature, stick it in the fridge.",
        "Apply your eyeliner.",
        "Apply one even layer of eyeliner to your eyelid right at your lash line.",
        "Apply more eyeliner if needed.",
        "Several thin layers of eyeliner will stay in place better than thick layers.",
        "Do not apply too much liner, because having excess liner can cause fallout and smudging.",
        "Use a light hand.",
        "When you apply your eyeliner, use a light hand.",
        "Your eye area is very delicate and being rough on it will cause your eyes to water.",
        "Watering eyes causes makeup to shift, so be gentle when applying your liner.",

        "Kelly Chu\t\t\tProfessional Makeup Artist\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: When you're applying your eyeliner, use a very light hand, and if you have oily skin or teary eyes, avoid applying the eyeliner to your waterline.",
        "I recommend using liquid eyeliner for the longest-lasting results If you'd like, you can set your eyeliner with a similarly-colored eyeshadow powder or setting spray.",
        "Avoid your waterline.",
        "If you want to do everything you can to avoid smudging, avoid putting eyeliner on your waterline.",
        "Your waterline is the rim of your eyelid that is against the eye, between the base of your lashes and your eyeball.",
        "Your waterline is very sensitive, and applying eyeliner there can cause your eyes to water.",
        "Watering eyes and tearing causes your eyeliner to shift downward, giving you the smudged, raccoon look.",
        "Some prefer the look of liner on their waterline rather than on their lash line.",
        "If you are not willing to give up putting eyeliner on your waterline, make sure that you are using a liner that is not irritating to your eyes.",
        "This may mean investing in a more expensive product than most drugstore eyeliners.",
        "Setting Your Eyeliner Apply eyeshadow over your eyeliner.",
        "After you apply your eyeliner, take a similarly-colored eyeshadow and use a thin brush to sweep a layer of eyeshadow over your eyeliner.",
        "For instance, if you used black eyeliner, use a matte black eyeshadow .This seals your liner and prevents it from running or smudging.",
        "Make sure not too use to much eyeshadow or a brush that is too large.",
        "You want just enough to cover and seal your liner; you should not even be able to tell that you have used eyeshadow.",
        "Do not use glittery eyeshadow to seal eyeliner.",
        "Glitter can seriously irritate your eyes and is best for lids, not the area around your eyes.",
        "Use a makeup sealer.",
        "Makeup sealers work by drying over your eyeliner so that it stays set.",
        "They are usually clear so that the sealer does not interfere with the color of your liner.",
        "You can find makeup sealer at stores like Sephora, Ulta or Target.",
        "Use Vaseline as a makeup sealer.",
        "If you do not have a makeup sealer and would rather not purchase one, just use Vaseline to seal your eyeliner.",
        "Take a Q-tip, pick up a dab of Vaseline, then pat it over your eyeliner.",
        "This functions in the same way as a sealer and will prevent your liner from running.",
        "Apply waterproof mascara.",
        "If you usually use mascara, make sure to use a waterproof mascara after applying your liner and sealer.",
        "Waterproof mascara can help your eyeliner from shifting around and smudging.",
        "Use a setting spray.",
        "Setting sprays use a mist formula to set your makeup.",
        "Once you have applied your liner and the rest of your eye makeup, close your eyes.",
        "Take the setting spray, hold it about a foot away from your eyes, and give your eyes one spray.",
        "Allow the setting spray to dry, and if there is excess moisture, blot carefully with a clean paper towel.",
        "Maintaining Your Eyeliner Use makeup remover throughout the day.",
        "Keep a pack of makeup remover cloths and a compact mirror with you throughout your day.",
        "If you notice your eyeliner shifting, fold a makeup cloth in a triangle shape and use an edge to wipe off excess makeup.",
        "Use gently and sparingly to avoid cleaning off too much makeup.",
        "Avoid rubbing your eyes.",
        "Be mindful of your makeup and try not to rub or touch the area around your eyes too much.",
        "You may be doing it unconsciously, but if you make a point of trying to remember then it should become second nature to you to avoid touching your eye area.",
        "Avoid the heat.",
        "Hot and sticky weather can melt your makeup and make it run.",
        "If you can avoid it, try not to spend excessive time in the heat.",
        "If you are spending time outside on a sunny day, wear sunglasses.",
        "This can shield your eye area from the sun and also prevents your eyes from watering as you squint.",
        "Avoid getting your face wet.",
        "Many eyeliners are not waterproof.",
        "A rainstorm, a swim session or a shower can all cause your makeup to run.",
        "Do your best to avoid getting your face wet after you put your makeup on.",
        "Also avoid excessive sweating, as this can have a similar effect of shifting your eye makeup.",

        "Also, try not to close your eyes very hard throughout the day, and reapply your powder if you need to.",
        "Purchasing the Right Eyeliner for You Buy a high-quality eyeliner.",
        "You may find that the problem with your eyeliner is not how you apply it, but that you are using a low-quality eyeliner.",
        "Some eyeliners are better than others.",
        "Poor-quality eyeliners do not have very long staying power and are more prone to smudging.",
        "They also may irritate your eyes, which causes watering and makes your eyeliner shift.",
        "Buy eyeliner from a makeup store like Sephora or Ulta.",
        "Their products are more expensive for a reason: it's because they are very high quality.",
        "There are good quality eyeliners at the drugstore, but you may want to do a little online research and read about others' experiences with the product.",
        "Buy waterproof eyeliner.",
        "Waterproof liner is much more resistant than non-waterproof liner.",
        "It lasts activities like swimming and showering, but it also resists tearing or watering of the eyes.",
        "If you are using eyeliner on your waterline, make it's waterproof.",
        "Buy liquid eyeliner.",
        "Liquid eyeliner is incredibly effective in not smudging.",
        "It goes on wet and after it dries it's extremely resistant to moving.",
        "Liquid liner gives a very crisp and uniform line, and is great for dramatic eye looks like cat eyes.",
        "It is best used on your upper last line.",
        "Liquid liners are not made to be used on your water line.",
        "Use a pencil liner instead.",
        "Make sure to give your liquid liner time to dry.",
        "Do not put on any other eye makeup before it's dry, or you could smudge the liner.",
        "Buy gel liner.",
        "A gel liner has a consistency that is in between a pencil and a liquid eyeliner.",
        "Like a liquid liner, it has great staying power after it's dry and is therefore much less prone to smudging.",
        "It also can be used on the waterline, so if you are looking for an optimal liner for your waterline, consider a gel liner."
