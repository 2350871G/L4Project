    "text": " Preparing the Jeans Find an old pair of jeans that you're happy to distress. The jeans should be 100% cotton, as other fabrics won't work the same. They should be baggy, straight, or boot-cut in order to make a true 90s look, but they can be any color. Prepare your tools at the same time. These can be found below, under the Things You'll Need. Decide what shape you want the rip to be. The most common shapes used to make slits are diamonds, circles, or rectangles. If you're not sure, start with a diamond shape, which tends to turn out well. Turn your pants inside out. Then use a ruler, and mark out two slits in the middle of the leg, going crossways across the knee area. To look like true-90s style ripped knees, the slits should go across the knee, stopping 2 centimeter (0.79 in) from the seam on both sides; if you want the rip to be smaller, then mark it 4 centimeter (1.6 in) from the seam.

Poke into the center of the markings of the slit, so the scissors will get into it with greater ease. Cut with a pair of scissors along the lines. Do the same on all the other slits. Distressing the Jeans Slide the cardboard under the cut slits. This will prevent any damage to the backs of the knees as you distress the jeans. Use the tweezers to pull white threads out.
