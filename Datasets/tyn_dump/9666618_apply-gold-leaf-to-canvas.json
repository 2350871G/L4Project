A darker background peeking through your gold typically looks more intentional than a light background, which may look more like an incomplete gold application. It\u2019s totally up to you though. If desired, you can use a small, flat soft-bristled brush to paint a white canvas another color with acrylic paints. What color you\u2019d like peeking through your gold leaf is up to you."

        "These typically still require protective gear, but do not require any further mixing.",
        "Apply two coats of varnish per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.",
        "Follow the manufacturer\u2019s directions to brush apply or spray your canvas with varnish and seal your gold leaf.",
        "This will keep your gold leaf from tarnishing.",
        "Take all protective precautions your varnish recommends, such as a mask, protective gloves, or eyewear.",
        "These products are usually toxic, and most require masks that are specifically rated with a certain level of particle protection.",

        "Let the varnish dry fully before handling your canvas.",
        "Let your canvas dry in a well-ventilated area away from pets and children.",
        "When it is completely dry, hang your work of art or paint more on the canvas as desired.",
