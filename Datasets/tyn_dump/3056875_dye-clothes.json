Cut the plant material and put it in a large stockpot with water. Cut the plant material into small pieces using a kitchen knife. Transfer it to a large stockpot. For every 1 part plant material, use 2 parts water. The stockpot should be about twice as large as the clothes you plan to dye. You may have to work in batches if you plan to dye a lot of clothes. Let the plant material simmer for at least 1 hour or overnight. The stockpot should be full of enough water to completely submerge the clothes you want to dye. To create the strongest dye, leave the plant material in the water overnight without heat. Or, leave the mixture simmering for 1-4 hours while you keep an eye on it. The longer you leave the mixture simmering, the stronger the dye will be. Strain the plant material out of the dye. Pour the mixture through a colander to remove the plant material from the liquid. Transfer the liquid back into your dyeing stockpot. Simmer the clothes in the dye for 1-8 hours. Place your wet clothes in the dye bath and simmer them over medium heat until the desired color is achieved. Stir the clothes occasionally to dye them evenly. Remember that the clothes will dry lighter than the color you see in the bath. At minimum, you will need to let the clothes sit in the dye bath for 1 hour. This will result in a light dye. For a rich shade, let the clothes sit in the dye bath 8 hours or overnight. Rinse dyed fabric in cold water. To get rid of excess dye, rinse the clothes in cold water. Rinse them until the water runs clear. Dry your clothes using a dryer or by drying them in the sun.",
