For frozen peaches, opt for ones that are already peeled. If you go with canned peaches, choose ones that are stored in water or fruit juice rather than in syrup. If the fresh peaches you have are extremely hard, put them into a paper bag for 1-2 days to soften them up a bit before pureeing them. If using frozen peaches, let them thaw at room temperature before moving on to the steaming process. If you\u2019re using canned peaches, drain them from their liquid before moving on to the steaming process.Warning: If you\u2019re making peach puree for a baby, make sure you have your pediatrician\u2019s approval to start giving them food first. Many babies are ready to be introduced to foods starting at 6 months old, but every child is different."

        "Try starting at the bottom of the peach where you made the X.",
        "If you\u2019re having a hard time getting the peeling process started, use a knife to gently lift the edge of the skin at the X and then peel it upwards, away from the peach.Tip: If you don\u2019t have time or don\u2019t want to boil and blanch the peaches, you can just peel them by hand with a vegetable peeler.",
        "Dice the peeled peaches into quarters and remove the pits.",
        "Use a knife and clean cutting board to halve and then quarter each peach.",
        "Be careful, as the peach will be slippery.",
        "Discard of the peach pits or put them into a compost pile.",
        "Steaming and Pureeing Put the peaches into a stockpot along with 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of liquid.",
        "Use either apple juice, water, or breastmilk.",
        "The extra liquid will help the puree get to a smoother consistency than if you were to just use peaches by themselves.",
        "Complete this process whether you\u2019re using fresh, frozen, or canned peaches.",
        "It\u2019s important to steam them to remove any potential bacteria.",
        "Plus, it\u2019ll help them achieve that smooth consistency that you want in a puree.",
        "Breastmilk will make the puree creamier, plus it has added nutrients that will benefit your baby.",
        "If you don\u2019t have breastmilk, you could also use formula for a similar effect.Peach Puree Isn\u2019t Just for Babies: It\u2019s also a popular ingredient in mixed drinks, like Bellinis.",
        "If you\u2019re making peach puree for something other than baby food, use 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of water and feel free to add 1-2 teaspoons (4-8 grams) of sugar to the stockpot for some added sweetness.",
        "Stir and cook the peaches over medium heat for 10 minutes.",
        "Use a wooden spoon or something similar to stir the peaches.",
        "Mash the peaches as you stir to help them soften quicker.",
        "Steaming the peaches in the stockpot helps break down stringy fibers in the peaches.",
        "Plus, it softens them even further, which will make it that much easier to get them to a puree consistency.",
        "Transfer the hot peaches to a food processor or blender.",
        "Turn off the burner and use a hot pad when touching the stockpot so you don\u2019t burn yourself.",
        "Use a wooden spoon or something similar to scoop the peaches out of the pot and gently put them into the food processor.",
        "Pour any remaining liquid from the pot into the processor after you\u2019ve removed all the peaches.",
        "Blend the peaches for 2 minutes or until they are completely smooth.",
        "Whether you use a food processor or a blender, check the consistency of the puree after 2 minutes to see how it\u2019s coming along.",
        "It should be soft, smooth, and completely free of chunks and lumps.",
        "You can\u2019t over-blend the puree, so don\u2019t be afraid to give it some extra time if you\u2019re worried about the consistency.",
        "Let the puree cool for 10-15 minutes before transferring it to a container.",
        "Set a timer so you don\u2019t forget about it.",
        "Wait until the puree has cooled down slightly so it is just warm to the touch before you store it.",
        "Don\u2019t leave the puree out at room temperature for more than 2 hours.",
        "If you do, it should be discarded because bacteria could have started to grow.",
        "Storing Puree in the Fridge Transfer the puree from the processor to an airtight glass container.",
        "You could use a large glass container to store all of the puree in one place, or you could divvy it up into smaller containers.",
        "Make sure the container you\u2019re using is clean, and use a clean spoon to move the puree.",
        "If you use a single large container and are feeding the puree to an infant, don\u2019t feed them directly from the container.",
        "Instead, transfer about 1 ounce (28 g) of puree into another container and feed your baby from that to avoid contaminating the rest of it.",
        "Store peach puree in the fridge for 3-5 days.",
        "If you notice any odd smells or spots on the puree, discard it immediately.",
        "If you haven\u2019t used all the puree after 3-5 days, you can freeze what is left.",
        "Apart from baby food and cocktails, you could also spread peach puree on toast or muffins, or you could even use it as a sweetener for oatmeal or hot cereals.",
        "Label the container with the date it was prepared.",
        "Puree in the fridge only lasts for a few days, so it\u2019s important you remember how long it\u2019ll stay good for.",
        "After 5 days, either freeze the puree or throw it out.",
        "Use masking tape for an easy label that\u2019ll wash off once it\u2019s no longer needed.",
        "Freezing Puree Pour the puree into ice cube trays to freeze baby-sized portions.",
        "If you want to store the puree for a longer period, freezing it is a great option.",
        "Use a silicone ice cube tray to make it easier to pop out the puree once it\u2019s frozen.",
        "Each ice cube tray makes about 1 ounce (28 g) of baby food, which is about how much your baby will eat at once.",
        "Cover the ice cube tray with a lid or plastic wrap.",
        "If your ice cube tray came with a lid, use it.",
        "If not, use plastic wrap to cover the puree while it is freezing.",
        "This just helps prevent freezer burn and keeps things out of the puree while it\u2019s still in its semi-liquid form.",
        "You could also use aluminum foil, but you\u2019ll need to check the puree very carefully after it\u2019s frozen to make sure none of it got stuck to the surface.",
        "Freeze the ice cube trays for several hours.",
        "Pop the covered ice cube trays into the freezer, making sure to keep them level so the puree doesn\u2019t get frozen to the covering.",
        "Leave them alone for 2-3 hours or overnight to ensure they\u2019re completely frozen through.",
        "Try sticking a toothpick into a puree cube.",
        "If it easily pushes into the center, the puree is still soft.",
        "If it can\u2019t penetrate the puree, chances are it is completely frozen.",
        "Pop out the frozen chunks of puree and transfer them to a plastic bag.",
        "Once the puree is frozen, remove it from the ice cube tray and store the blocks in a resealable, freezer-safe plastic bag.",
        "This helps save storage room in your freezer, though if you have space, you could leave the puree in the tray.",
        "Label the outside of the bag with the \u201cdate made\u201d so you can easily remember how long the puree will be good for.",
        "Use frozen puree within 3-6 months of freezing it for the best quality.",
        "As long as your freezer stays at 0 \u00b0F (\u221218 \u00b0C), the puree should technically be good indefinitely, but the flavor of the puree will decline over time.Defrosting Frozen Puree: Remove a portion of puree from the freezer 24 hours before you\u2019d like to use it and let it defrost in an airtight container in the fridge.",
        "Reheat the puree in the microwave in 10-15 second increments."
