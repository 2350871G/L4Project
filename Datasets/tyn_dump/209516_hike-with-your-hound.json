It is important to have a collar and tags for identification purposes in case your dog gets spooked or wanders off. Snacks.

Some dogs may need paw protection, especially if you will be walking on hot, very cold, or rough terrain. Dog booties can be purchased from dog parlors, hiking stores or pet stores.
