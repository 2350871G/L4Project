    "text": " Making the Lemon Cupcakes Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). At this time, you can also prepare your cupcake pan by inserting the paper liners into the wells. Cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. You can do this using a handheld mixer or an electric mixer with a paddle attachment. To make mixing even easier, cut the butter into cubes first. Mix in the eggs and vanilla extract. Beat the eggs in one at a time, then add the vanilla extract with the second egg. Add in the flour and baking powder and continue mixing. To avoid any lumps and clumps, pour the flour and baking powder through a sifter. Stir in the milk, lemon juice, and lemon zest until everything is just combined. Do not over-mix the batter, or the cupcakes will be tough. For a more complex flavor, add 1 tablespoon of toasted poppy seeds. Fill the cupcake liners two-thirds of the way with the batter. An ice cream scooper is a great way to do this. It is quick, easy, and it will ensure that each liner gets the same amount of batter. Bake on the center rack for 20 to 25 minutes. The cupcakes are done when the edges turn golden brown, and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean. Another way to tell if the cupcakes are done is by pressing on one of the domes; if it bounces back up, it's done. Let the cupcakes cool before decorating them. Let them cool in the pan for 10 minutes first, then transfer them to a baking rack to finish cooling. Choose a frosting or glaze from below to decorate your cupcakes with. Making Vanilla Buttercream Frosting Beat the butter until it turns smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. You can do this using an electric mixer or a handheld mixer fitted with paddles. This recipe will give you a frosting that is rich and creamy, perfect for spreading or piping. Mix in \u00be cup and (95 grams) of confectioners'/icing sugar.

You can do this simply by spreading the buttercream on using a spatula. or fancier cupcakes, you can pipe them on using a piping bag and a decorator's tip. Making Icing Glaze Sift the confectioners'/icing sugar into a small mixing bowl. This icing is much more delicate than the typical frosting or buttercream. It is glaze-like and perfect for pouring or drizzling. Mix in 2 to 6 tablespoons of milk or water. How much liquid you add will depend on how thick or thin you want your glaze to be. Keep in mind that it will harden once it sets. If you'd like to make a lemon glaze, use lemon juice instead. Stir in \u00bd teaspoon of vanilla or almond extract. If you are making lemon glaze, consider skipping the extract and using 2 teaspoons of lemon zest instead. Whisk until the mixture is smooth and syrupy.
