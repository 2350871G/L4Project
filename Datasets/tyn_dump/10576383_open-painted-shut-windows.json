If your window has a top and bottom sash, start with the lower one. A utility knife also works well for most windows, but may not be able to cut through thicker beads of paint. Another option is a specialty blade called a window zipper, available at many hardware stores."

        "Leveraging it with tools may also help, but be careful not to force it too much and damage it.",
        "Wiggle the window sash to free it from any remaining paint.",
        "Pull the sash gently towards you.",
        "Push the sash back, then pull it towards you again slowly.",

        "Removing and Repairing a Window Cut the sash cords behind the window stop to remove the sash.",
        "The sash cords are hidden inside the wall.",
        "When you remove the stop on the right side, you will see what looks like a hidden compartment.",
        "Use a sharp knife or scissors to slice through the thick cords hanging there.",
        "Then, slide the window sash away from the wall.",
        "The sash cords have weights on their ends.",

        "Scrape loose paint off of the window sash.",
        "Set the window sash down on a flat, stable surface.",
        "Most likely an old sash will have lots of debris and other material around its frame.",

        "Sand the sash frame smooth with 100-grit sandpaper.",
        "Wear down the frame until it looks roughly level.",
        "Avoid touching the glass with the sandpaper, since it could lead to scratches.",
        "If you see any holes in the frame from rot, fill them in now with wood putty or epoxy, then sand the area flat again.",
        "Prime and paint the sash the frame.",
        "Spread a coat of wood primer over the entire frame, then let it rest for about 3 hours.",
        "After the primer has dried, open a can of water-resistant latex paint.",
        "Let the paint dry for at least 1 hour.",
        "If you need to apply a second coat of paint, wait 4 hours.",
        "Think of what color the rest of the window frame is.",

        "Place the nails about every 10 in (25 cm) to complete the window.",
        "Test the window sash thoroughly to make sure it opens.",
        "If it doesn\u2019t open, the sash cords may be the issue and they are easier to adjust before you replace the stops."
