Conduct searches using what you consider to be your most popular keywords. Judge the relevance based on your competition. If that search pulls up competitors and products that offer what you offer, then you may try to get a larger share of that market. If the search terms don't bring up similar products, change your terms to try to find more specific words that will be more profitable. Do some paid advertising for research. Set up Pay-Per-Click campaigns using your top keywords on Google AdWords and/or Microsoft adCenter. Determine the number of sales you achieve for your ad to get a percentage. Analyze the profitability of your keywords by establishing the profit you get from the clicks you receive. Determine how many dollars you reap per 100 visitors.
