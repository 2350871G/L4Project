If you are painting a large room, use additional drop cloths to cover the floor if 1 is not enough. This way, your surfaces will be covered if any paint splatters. If you can, remove the furniture from the room so paint doesn't get on it. If you can't move the furniture, cover it with a drop cloth."

Rip pieces of tape about 6\u201312 in (15\u201330 cm) long, and stick them where the wall meets the floor, such as the baseboards, vents, and window frames. For example, rip a long piece of tape and place it on your carpet where it meets the floor molding. That way, no paint will end up on your carpet."

                    "description": "If you\u2019d like, you can paint your wall before you add the sponge effect. Pour oil-based house paint with primer into a paint tray, and dip a paint roller into the paint. You can use either water-based or oil-based paint, but oil-based tends to look better overall. Then, apply the paint roller to the wall, and roll it across to distribute the paint. Continue doing this until your wall is completely covered. Let the paint dry for 12 hours. If you'd like a very glossy finish, select a high-gloss house paint, for instance. Do this if you want to change the color of the walls so it shows up through the sponge application. It may be easier to use a paintbrush to cover the spots toward the floor or corners. For example, you can paint your walls teal to add an accenting color."

Then, pour in 4 times as much clear latex glaze. Mix this up thoroughly using a paint mixer. The color of your paint should be slightly lighter than before you mixed it. The latex glaze provides a slightly shiny finish, which looks great when sponge painting. For instance, if you paint your walls teal, you can sponge paint with an aqua blue color. You can use paint with a matte or shiny finish. Since you will mix it with glaze, it does not matter what finish type you choose."
