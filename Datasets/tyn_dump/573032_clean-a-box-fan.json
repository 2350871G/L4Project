You can also use mild dish soap mixed with water and use a q-tip to help you clean out hard to reach areas. Take care not to get any water or cleaning agents in the motor, however, since this can cause damage. Gently wipe down all plastic parts, like the outside of the fan, its carrying handle, and its knobs, with a damp cloth."

If you like, you can also construct your own DIY filter and attach it to the front of your fan, allowing it to do double-duty as an air purifier. For example, if you have a 20 in (51 cm) box fan, purchase a 20 in (51 cm) by 20 in (51 cm) MERV 11 furnace filter and attach it to the front of your fan with some heavy-duty tape."
