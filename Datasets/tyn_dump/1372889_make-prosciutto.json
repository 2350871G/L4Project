The salt will draw the moisture out of the meat and the pan will catch the drippings. The rack also allows for air circulation. Put the pork and pan into a sealed plastic bag and place in the refrigerator for 4 to 6 weeks. Rinse the meat with cold water. Wrap the prosciutto in cheesecloth and hang it in a dry, cold place for 6 months to 2 years."
