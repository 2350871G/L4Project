If you have more than 4 people, take turns playing, or split up into teams. Have the oldest player deal everyone 10 cards face down. The dealer is always the oldest player. The cards everyone is dealt are their \u201cstockpile.\u201d The goal of the game is to get rid of all the cards in your stockpile before anyone else. If you want a shorter game, deal out fewer cards. For a longer game, deal out more cards. Turn the top card on your stockpile face up. Place the card on the top of your stockpile after you turn it face up. Every player should do this, including the dealer. Let the youngest player go first. The youngest player always gets to go first in Skip-Bo Junior. Playing the Game Have the dealer deal the first player 3 cards face up. The cards should be spread out in a row next to each other. These 3 cards are known as the player\u2019s \u201chand.\u201d At the beginning of every player\u2019s turn, they\u2019re dealt 3 new face-up cards into their hand. Let the first player play a \u201c1\u201d card or wild card if they have it. Playing a card means putting it on 1 of the 4 building piles in the center of the playing area (there shouldn\u2019t be any building piles at this point).

After they play it, they should flip the next card in their stockpile face up. Their hand: If one of the 3 cards the dealer gave them is a \u201c1\u201d card or wild card, they can play that card. Have the first player pass if they can't play any cards. Whenever a player can't play a card from their hand or stockpile, their turns ends. Play passes to the player on their left. Let the first player play until they can\u2019t play any more cards. There\u2019s no limit to how many cards a player can play during their turn. Your turn ends when you can\u2019t play any of the cards in your hand or the top card in your stockpile. After your turn is over, play moves to the left. For example, if the first player had a \u201c1\u201d card in their hand and played it, they could then play a \u201c2\u201d card on top of the \u201c1\u201d card if they have one. If they also had a \u201c3\u201d card, they could then play that on top of the \u201c2\u201d card, and so on.

Deal the second player their hand and let them take their turn. The second player can play off of the building piles the first player started, or create new building piles with \u201c1\u201d cards or wild cards. The second player\u2019s turn is over when they can no longer play any cards. For example, if the second player has a \u201c4\u201d card in their hand, and there\u2019s a building pile with a \u201c3\u201d card on top, they could play their \u201c4\u201d card on that building pile. Continue playing until one player plays all the cards in their stockpile. When a player plays the last card in their stockpile, the game is over and they\u2019re the winner. Collect all the cards and shuffle them back together. If you want to play again, deal out 10 cards to each player face down and start the game over again, with the youngest player going first. Following Other Important Rules Use wild cards to replace any number in the sequence. You can use a wild card in place of any card in the game. For example, if you had a wild card and the top card on one of the building piles was a \"7,\" you could play your wild card as an \"8\" card. Remove a building pile whenever it reaches 10 cards. When a player plays a \u201c10\u201d card \u2014 or a wild card they\u2019re using as a 10 \u2014 on top of a building pile, that building pile is completed and it should be removed from the playing area. A player can start a new building pile in its place using a \u201c1\u201d card or wild card. Stack your new hand on your old hand if you didn\u2019t use it last turn.

If you play a card from your hand and reveal a card underneath it, you can now play the card that was revealed. Shuffle the cards from discarded building piles when you run out of cards. If the dealer doesn\u2019t have enough cards to deal a player their hand, the dealer should grab all the cards from previously completed building piles that were discarded and shuffle them together. Those cards are then used to deal players their hands.",
