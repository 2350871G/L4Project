This is especially important for ensuring paint adheres to linoleum kitchen floors. If you find that the surface of the linoleum is still glossy, use a degreaser or a wax stripper to remove the final layer of protective wax. Rinse the floor until it is cleared of any cleaner residue and allow it to dry completely."

This removes any remaining traces of wax that you may not be able to see and roughs up the surface enough to grip the paint."
