                    "description": "Your best options include Lamisil, Lotrimin Ultra, and/or Naftin. These are more expensive, but they will get rid of jock itch faster. Prefer Lotrimin Ultra which contains Butenafine Hydrochloride over regular Lotrimin AF which just contains clotrimazole. Studies have shown Butenafine can be faster and more effective than clotrimazole. Furthermore, generic clotrimazole can be purchased for as low as a dollar a tube whereas regular Lotrimin AF (containing clotrimazole) can retail for up to 10 times that amount. Try asking your doctor for a prescription anti-fungal cream. This may make the cost of the medication a little less expensive. You can also purchase cheaper creams containing clotrimazole or miconazole. These will take a little longer to work, but they will effectively wipe out jock itch. Even when the symptoms disappear, you need to apply cream to your groin area for the amount of time specified on the package. Just like you take antibiotics until all of the medicine is gone, you need to follow the full treatment regimen using your cream. Treat athlete's foot at the same time if you have it. Doing this will decrease the risk for recurrence."

Your doctor can offer you a couple of options:\n\nPrescription creams: Doctors can prescribe prescription strength anti-fungals including econazole and oxiconazole. Antibiotics: If your jock itch has become infected, doctors can prescribe an antibiotic to help clear up the infection. Oral anti-fungal medications: Sporanox, Diflucan or Lamisil are all medications that your doctor may prescribe for you. These prescriptions may be given for one month to one year. You may experience gastrointestinal problems or abnormal liver function. If you're taking antacids or warfarin, you probably shouldn't take these medications. Another option, Grifulvin V, takes longer to work but seems good for people who are allergic to other anti-fungals or who have conditions that makes taking other medications a bad idea."
