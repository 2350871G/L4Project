You can use any combination of fruit you want, including bananas, strawberries, blueberries, mango, orange, apple, pineapple, and avocado. You'll need about 1 1/2 cups (355 milliliters) of fruit. Consider adding both a creamy fruit and a flavorful fruit. For instance, avocado and banana are creamy and mango is thick and pulpy, while orange, pineapple, and strawberry add a punch of flavor. Frozen fruit is a great addition to smoothies. It's cheap, and you can just throw it in frozen.
