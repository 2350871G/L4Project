                    "description": "The type of tank that any reptile or amphibian pet needs depends on several factors that vary by species, including:\nThe size of an adult. An adult fire-bellied newt is approximately 4-6 inches long; sometimes pet stores carry juveniles as small as two inches long. Its habitat in the wild. Fire-bellied newts originate in Japan, where they are semi-aquatic and spend most of their time in clear, cool bodies of water like lakes, ponds, and streams. This means that pet newts need a home that has water to swim in but also some areas of land; a good rule of thumb is to divide its home with 70% being water and 30% dry land. Its habits. Newts are amphibians, so they go through metamorphosis from a tadpole, to larva, to fully developed adult. They spend the first part of their life in water, and as adults spend time on land and in the water. Older fire-belly newts are more aquatic and are generally easier to keep as pets. They can live up to thirty years with excellent care; most live to be about fifteen. Its diet. Newts in the wild are carnivorous and like a diet of insects, but you can also feed them dried reptile or amphibian food such as Reptomin Floating Food Sticks. While it's fine to feed them primarily dried food, they need a varied diet including live food such as bloodworms, blackworms, guppies, and crickets; this keeps them active and alert since they have to \"hunt,\" and also helps to ensure they get the proper nutrition. Before you purchase newts, be sure that you have a local store or source to regularly purchase these insects. You must also be sure you'll be comfortable keeping such food available for the newts and feeding live food to them."

                    "description": "Salamanders are not social nor are they solitary; that means they really don't care either way if they live alone or with others. However, you must only put fire-bellied newts with other newts of the same species and no other types of animals or creatures. Fire-bellied newts secrete a toxin from their skin that can be harmful to other species and other types of animals, so it is important to keep only newts of one species in your aquarium. Be aware that Japanese and Chinese fire-bellied newts are actually two separate species and they should not be kept together. They are hard to tell apart unless you have seen both types, but Chinese newts are a bit smaller, smoother, and have slightly rounder tail tips than Japanese newts. If in doubt, buy your newts from the same tank at the same store, so that you know they are the same species."
