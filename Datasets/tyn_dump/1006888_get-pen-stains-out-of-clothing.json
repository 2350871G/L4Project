Blot the ink stain using a damp cloth before you apply the stain remover. Try to lift as much of the ink stain as you can using just the cloth. Apply the stain remover to the pen stain.

Read the instructions that came with the stain remover to see how long you should leave it on the garment. If you\u2019re not sure, leave it on for about ten minutes. Blot the stain using a cloth. You should begin to notice more of the ink transferring from the stained garment to the cloth. This is a sign that the stain remover is working. Put the stained garment in the washing machine by itself. This will prevent the ink from transferring to other clothes in the wash. Wash the stained garment on the same setting you normally would. Check to see if the pen stain came out in the wash. If it didn't, repeat the process, starting with applying the stain remover to the stain. Make sure the garment is stain-free before you dry it. Never put stained clothing in the dryer, as the heat will set the stain and make it much harder to remove. Using Rubbing Alcohol Use isopropyl alcohol, also known as rubbing alcohol. You can find rubbing alcohol at your local drugstore or pharmacy. Apply the rubbing alcohol to the stain using a cloth or cotton ball. Gently dab it on and let it sit for two minutes. Never rub anything into a pen stain, as rubbing may cause the stain to sink in and spread more. Always dab onto a stain instead. Use a damp cloth to blot the ink stain repeatedly. Apply pressure with your hand to encourage more of the ink to lift off the stained garment. Periodically check the cloth for ink to see if the rubbing alcohol is working.

Repeat the process if the stain is still there. Keep trying to lift more and more of the ink off the garment using rubbing alcohol and a cloth. If the rubbing alcohol stops working, you may need to try a different method to remove the stain. Using Glycerin Get a bottle of pure, liquid glycerin. You can find liquid glycerin at your local drugstore or pharmacy. Apply the glycerin to the ink stain using a cotton swab. Dab it onto the stained garment so the entire stain is covered, and let it set. Add a few drops of laundry detergent to a bowl of water. Mix the detergent and water together in the bowl. Apply the detergent mixture to the stain using a cotton swab. Gently rub the surface of the stain using the cotton swab to help the detergent mixture lather. Machine wash the stained garment with cold water. Check to see if the stain is gone after the garment is finished washing. If the stain is still there, repeat the process. Using Hairspray Use hairspray that contains alcohol. Avoid hairsprays with added perfumes, oils, or conditioners, as they can stain and damage clothing. Check the ingredients list on the bottle before using a hairspray. Dampen the ink stain with a wet cloth or sponge. This will prevent the hairspray from drying out on the stain. Spray the ink stain with the hairspray. Hold the hairspray about 2 inches (5 cm) from the stain while you're spraying. Make sure the stain is completely soaked with hairspray. Scrub the hairspray into the ink stain using a scrub brush. Use a toothbrush for smaller stains. Wash the stained garment on its regular setting. Check to see if the pen stain is gone before you put the garment in the dryer. If the stain is still there, apply more hairspray to the stain or try using a different stain remover.",
