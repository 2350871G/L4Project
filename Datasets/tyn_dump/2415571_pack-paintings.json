Making an X prevents the glass from shattering completely if it breaks, protecting the painting. Use masking tape or painter\u2019s tape. Sticky tape like duct or packing tape will leave remnants behind and could ruin the glass. If your painting isn\u2019t framed, then skip this step. Don\u2019t let any tape touch the painting itself.

Cut the paper to the correct size if you have to. For especially wide paintings, you may need to lay 2 sheets side by side. Glassine paper is a non-stick material that protects the painting from moisture and dirt. It is available online or from craft stores. If you don\u2019t have glassine paper, don\u2019t use wax paper as a substitute. This could stick to your painting. For short trips or less valuable paintings, the glassine isn\u2019t crucial. Just be sure to unwrap your paintings as soon as you arrive at the location. If your painting isn't framed or canvassed, cut 2 pieces of cardboard the same size as the painting.
