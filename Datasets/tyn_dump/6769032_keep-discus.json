        "Don\u2019t change more than 30% of the total volume of the tank water at a time\u2014a greater change can be too much of a shock for sensitive discus fish.",
        "Feeding Discus Fish Use live or frozen proteins for 50%-plus of the discus\u2019 diet.",
        "At least half of a discus fish diet should be comprised of live or frozen proteins, such as bloodworms, brine shrimp, and fine pieces of beef heart.",
        "Beef heart can be purchased frozen from fish supply retailers.",
        "You can also purchase bloodworms and brine shrimp either live or frozen.",
        "Discus fish often prefer live bloodworms and brine shrimp, but these are more likely to carry parasites or bacteria.",
        "To reduce this possibility, buy high-quality worms and shrimp from a reputable vendor.",
        "Otherwise, use frozen worms and shrimp.",
        "Rotate among the proteins you use in order to maintain some variety in the diet.",
        "Supplement live or frozen proteins with high-quality flake fish food.",
        "While the live or frozen proteins should make up the majority of the discus\u2019 diet, flakes offer some variety as well as supplemental nutritional value.",
        "You can add some flakes with each feeding, or use them as a more occasional change-of-pace.",
        "Choose high-quality fish flakes, since these typically have a better nutritional profile.",
        "Ask your vet or other fish owners for recommendations.",
        "Feed discus 2-3 times daily, in a calm setting and on a regular schedule.",
        "Discus fish prefer consistent timing and limited distractions during feeding times.",
        "Feed the fish around the same times each day, and prevent distractions such as a loud TV or rowdy kids playing in the room.",
        "Juvenile discus fish should eat 3 times per day, while adults should be feed 2 times daily.",
        "Remove uneaten food right away to keep the water clean.",
        "When it comes to the amount of food to offer, aim to give enough for the fish to finish in 10-15 minutes.",
        "If there is any food left after 15 minutes, use a net to remove it from the tank.",
        "This will help keep the water cleaner for longer.",
        "If all the food is eaten in 5-10 minutes, offer more per feeding.",
        "If there is quite a bit left over after 15 minutes, reduce the amount offered.",
        "Note any changes in their eating or defecation habits.",
        "Because discus fish thrive under a consistent routine, any changes should be carefully noted.",
        "If a fish is eating substantially less than usual, for example, this could be a sign of illness.",
        "Likewise, if the amount or appearance of the feces they produce changes, don\u2019t ignore it.",
        "Contact a vet with experience dealing with tropical fish if you have concerns about the health of your discus fish.",
        "Adding Fish and Watching for Illness Quarantine new fish in a separate tank for 2-4 weeks.",
        "New fish should always be quarantined before you add them to your main aquarium, and this is particularly important for the sensitive discus fish.",
        "Observe the new fish in the quarantine tank for at least 2 weeks, and ideally 4 weeks, before moving them to the main tank.",
        "If the new fish show any signs of illness, do not move them into the main tank.",
        "The quarantine tank can be a bit smaller than the main tank, but it should be set up in the same manner.",
        "The more similar the tanks are, the easier the transition will be.",
        "Watch for signs of \u201cdiscus plague\u201d or other illnesses.",
        "Discuss fish are very susceptible to this somewhat mysterious illness, which is hard to eradicate and often fatal.",
        "To identify \u201cdiscus plague,\u201d look for a darkening of body color, clamping fins, lethargy, a refusal to eat, or other unexplained physical or behavioral changes.",
        "You can try quarantining a fish that displays potential symptoms, but it\u2019s hard to prevent the spread of illnesses like \u201cdiscus plague.\u201d If you suspect a problem, contact a vet quickly.",
        "Keep at least 4-6 discus in your main tank whenever possible.",
        "As a shoaling species that naturally congregates in groups, discus are not suited to solitary living.",
        "You should keep a minimum group of 4-6 discus in your main tank, and add more discus in groups of 4-6 as well.",
        "So, instead of adding 1 or 2 new discus to your aquarium at a time (after quarantine), try adding them in groups of 4-6.",
        "Make sure you have sufficient tank space, however\u2014you\u2019ll need at least a 70 US gal (260 L) tank for 10 discus fish.",
        "Discus usually get along well, but you may run into instances of aggression and territoriality.",
        "In this case, you may need to separate the fish into different aquariums.",
        "Consider adding tetras as aquarium companions.",
        "If you\u2019d like to add some fish variety to your discus aquarium, consider adding 6 or more cardinal or bleeding heart tetras.",
        "Both of these tetra varieties tend to get along well with discus fish.",
        "You won\u2019t need a larger tank to add 6-12 tetras.",
        "You may want to increase the tank size by 10 US gal (38 L) for larger numbers of tetras, though.",
        "As with any other fish, quarantine tetras before adding them to the main tank.",
        "Try your hand at breeding discus fish.",
        "If you keep both males and females in a clean, well-maintained tank, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll eventually see tiny discus eggs in the aquarium.",
        "If you want to increase your number of discus, you can choose to keep the hatchlings with their parents or isolate them in a separate tank.",
        "If you keep the hatchlings in the main tank, there isn\u2019t much you need to change from your typical routine.",
        "You\u2019ll likely lose a greater number of hatchlings through cannibalism this way, however.",
        "To isolate the hatchlings, you\u2019ll either have to move the eggs to a separate tank, or temporarily relocate the adult discus.",
        "In either case, the secondary tank should be prepared to the same standards as the main tank."
