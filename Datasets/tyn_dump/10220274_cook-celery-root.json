Slice off all the roots by cutting deep into the celery root. While you may lose some of the root that could be used in cooking by doing this, it's a much easier process than trimming the roots 1 at a time. It's a very difficult task to remove all of the smaller roots so don't try it. You'll need a big, sharp knife as the celery root can be pretty tough to cut through."

If the skin is soft on your celery root, you might be able to get away with slicing the skin off using a vegetable peeler. Feel the skin of the celery root to find out how tough it is. Use your fingers to push into the skin with some pressure. If the skin won't give way, it's very tough. If you can push the skin in, it's soft. Since the celery root isn't completely smooth, there might be some crevices in the celery root with dirt. Use a knife to slice through the crevice and remove the dirt."

Slice a lemon in half and rub the lemon over the celery root. This will preserve the celery root and prevent it from losing its color. If you want to store the root for a few days, place it in the fridge after rubbing it with the lemon.

Making Celery Root Soup Peel your celery root, apples, and potatoes. Use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin from your apples and your potatoes. If the skin is too tough for a vegetable peeler, use a paring knife to remove the skin. Cut the celery root, apples, and potatoes into 1 inch (2.5 cm) chunks. You might need to use your chef's knife to slice the celery root. The chunks don't need to be exactly 1 inch (2.5 cm) in size, but slice them as near to this measurement as you can.

Add leek to the saucepan and cook until it's soft and semi-transparent. After adding the leek into the saucepan, stir it with a spoon or fork every 30 seconds. It should take around 3 minutes for the leek to go soft and become semi-transparent. Put the diced ingredients, salt, pepper, and garlic into the saucepan. Add all of the chunks of apple, potatoes, and celery root into the saucepan. Sprinkle in 2 tsp (20g) of salt, 1 tsp (10g) of black pepper, and your peeled and smashed garlic cloves. Stir to cover the ingredients in the oil. Add the water and broth to the mixture and bring it to a boil. Pour in 3 cups (600ml) of water and 2 cups (400ml) of vegetable broth. Pour the water and vegetable broth into the saucepan slowly as you don't want the hot oil to splash out of the saucepan. Bring the saucepan to a boil after you add these ingredients in.

        "Toss the bowl or mix the ingredients with a fork until the carrots are coated by the other ingredients.",

        "You might need to use your chef's knife to slice the celery root.",
        "The chunks don't need to be exactly 1 inch (2.5 cm) in size, but slice them as near to this measurement as you can.",

        "This tool will slice your ingredients into chunks far quicker than you could ever hope to do it with a knife.",

        "Bring the saucepan to a boil after you add these ingredients in.",
        "Cover the pan and reduce the heat to low.",
        "Let the ingredients simmer in the saucepan for 25 to 30 minutes.",
        "When finished, the vegetables should be very tender and easy to pierce with a knife.",
        "If the vegetables are a little too hard when you try to pierce them with a knife, give them another 5 minutes in the saucepan.",
        "Remove 1 cup (200ml) of liquid from the pan.",
        "Place the cup aside once you've removed it from the pan.",

        "Pour the ingredients from the saucepan into the blender once they've cooled down.",
        "Remove the lid from the blender and cover the gap with a tea towel.",
        "Leaving the cap on will keep steam in the blender and might cause the small cap to pop off.",

        "If they haven't, blend until they do turn to liquid.",
        "Return the soup to the saucepan and place it over low heat.",
        "This will keep the soup warm.",

        "If it is too thick, slowly add the liquid from the cup you removed earlier until the soup reaches the consistency you want.",
        "Serve the soup in a bowl or a cup.",
        "Taste the soup to find out if you need to season it.",
        "If you think it needs some seasoning, add as much salt and black pepper as you like.",
        "If you want to keep the soup as leftovers, cover the bowl with some plastic wrapping and place it in the fridge.",
        "Consume it within 3 days as it will lose most of its taste and flavor if left for longer."
