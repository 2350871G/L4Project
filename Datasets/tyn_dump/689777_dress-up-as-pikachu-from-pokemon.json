You want to make sure that you find a shade that closely matches the color of Pikachu\u2019s fur, which is a bright school bus yellow. After this, paint three brown stripes on the back. These stripes should be horizontal and 2-3 inches thick. You also want to make sure they go from one side of your back to the other in a semi-oval shape. If you don\u2019t have brown paint, you can also use black."

You want the part that attaches to your pants to be brown. Once you\u2019ve finished, you can either stick the tail in a back pocket, tape/staple it, or hot glue it on. Similar to the ears, you can also use felt to make the tail. For example, take a large yellow piece of felt and cut two mirror lightning bolt shapes. Then, hot glue the edges together and stuff it with cotton and crumpled paper. Since this tail will be heavier, you may want to hot glue the tail to your pants in multiple places."

Once you match a yellow to the rest of your outfit, paint the entirety of your face with it - avoiding your eyes. Then, use red paint or blush to paint your cheeks. Since you want the color on your cheeks to be a perfect circle, try tracing the bottom of a glass or similar round object before you paint it in with red. Once you\u2019ve finished your cheeks, paint the tip of your nose black. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable painting your whole face, feel free to only paint your cheeks and nose. Whichever face paint you use, make sure you aren\u2019t allergic to any of the ingredients first."
