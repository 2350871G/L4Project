This bacteria can cause your gums to bleed. Mouthwash. Braces make it easy for food residue to collect in and around your teeth. A rinse with mouthwash for 60 seconds can help and also ensure fresh breath and provide antibacterial protection. Threader Floss. Ordinary floss is difficult to use with braces; however, flossing is an important part of dental hygiene. Threader floss are small plastic strands with a long loop on one end. They can be threaded through the small gaps between teeth and the loop functions the same way floss would, removing obstructions like food residue and tartar. Proxabrush or Bi-Level brush. A proxabrush is also called a \"Christmas Tree Brush\" because of its shape. It has a triangular, conical shape and can fit under the arch wire of your braces to give a thorough brushing. Or get a bi-level brush, designed with shorter bristles in the middle from brushing over your brackets. Oral Analgesic.

        "These parts will be even more difficult once you get braces, so start thinking about what would help you keep those areas clean.",
        "Create a shopping list.",
        "Your orthodontist can give you recommendations for products and brands that will help you keep your teeth clean while wearing braces.",
        "Below is a list of commonly suggested items:\nA waterpik.",
        "Braces make it difficult for ordinary brushing to do the job.",
        "Waterpiks spray a concentrated stream of water through the tip of a wand and can be used on even the hardest to reach corners of your mouth, which can eliminate the bacteria that gets stuck between your teeth and gums.",
        "This bacteria can cause your gums to bleed.",
        "Mouthwash.",
        "Braces make it easy for food residue to collect in and around your teeth.",
        "A rinse with mouthwash for 60 seconds can help and also ensure fresh breath and provide antibacterial protection.",
        "Threader Floss.",
        "Ordinary floss is difficult to use with braces; however, flossing is an important part of dental hygiene.",
        "Threader floss are small plastic strands with a long loop on one end.",
        "They can be threaded through the small gaps between teeth and the loop functions the same way floss would, removing obstructions like food residue and tartar.",
        "Proxabrush or Bi-Level brush.",
        "A proxabrush is also called a \"Christmas Tree Brush\" because of its shape.",
        "It has a triangular, conical shape and can fit under the arch wire of your braces to give a thorough brushing.",
        "Or get a bi-level brush, designed with shorter bristles in the middle from brushing over your brackets.",
        "Oral Analgesic.",
        "While your mouth is adjusting to braces, it is not uncommon to experience sores on high-friction areas.",
        "There are liquid, gel, and paste types of oral analgesic; decide which one is right for your needs.",
        "Get a mouth guard.",
        "If you play sports, be sure to wear a mouth guard.",
        "With some sports, like basketball or football, mouth guards are already standard.",
        "When you are wearing braces, however, any athletic activity-- especially those that involve throwing a ball or physical contact with other players--could result in facial injury, stitches, veneers, or resetting the braces entirely if hit in the mouth.",
        "A mouth guard that fits your needs will be available at any athletics or sporting good store.",
        "You can also ask your dentist or orthodontist to provide you with a custom made mouth guard if the ones in the store do not fit properly because of your braces."
