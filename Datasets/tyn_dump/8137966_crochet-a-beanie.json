    "text": " Making a Basic Beanie Start with a chain circle. Make 4 chain stitches. Next, make a slip stitch into the first chain to form a circle. Use a size I/9 or 5.5mm crochet hook and medium worsted weight yarn. Do your second round. Start off with 2 chain stitches. Next, do 3 double crochet stitches in each space. Close your round with a slip stitch. You will end up with 12 stitches total. Mark the end of your round with a stitch marker. If you don't have one, you can use a safety pin or even a piece of yarn in a contrasting color. Start your first increasing round. Start off with 2 chain stitches. Do 2 double crochet stitches in the first stitch. Follow up with 1 double crochet. Repeat the last 3 stitches (2 double crochets in 1 stitch, followed by 1 double crochet) until you reach the end of the round. Close the third found off with a slip stitch. You should have a total of 18 stitches. Do not turn your project. You might want to move your stitch marker to the end of your round, however. Do your second increasing row, then close it off with a slip stitch. Start with 2 chain stitches. Then, do 2 double crochets in the same stitch. Follow up with 2 double crochets over the next 2 stitches. Repeat the last 4 stitches (2 double crochets in 1 stitch, 2 double crochets over the next 2 stitches) until you reach the end of the round. Close the round off with a slip stitch. You'll end up with 24 stitches. Remember to move your stitch marker, if you are using one. Continue doing your increases for rounds 5 to 8. Start each row with 2 chain stitches and 2 double crochets in the first stitch. Do x-number of stitches, then repeat (2 double crochets in one stitch, followed by x-number of double crochets) until you reach the end of the row. Close each round off with a slip stitch. How many stitches you do for \"x\" depends on what round you are on. The number \"x\" increases with each round. For example:\nRound 5: 2 double crochet in 1 stitch, 3 double crochets over the next 3 stitches. 30 stitches total. Round 6: 2 double crochet in 1 stitch, 4 double crochets over the next 4 stitches. 36 stitches total. Round 7: 2 double crochet in 1 stitch, 5 double crochets over the next 5 stitches. 42 stitches total. Round 8: 2 double crochet in 1 stitch, 6 double crochets over the next 6 stitches. 48 stitches total. If you have a very large head, you can add more rounds with similar increases. If you have a smaller head, you can do fewer rounds. Start doing the body of your hat. Start off with 2 chain stitches. Next, do a double crochet in each space until you finish the round. Use a slip stitch to close the round. Continue doing the body of your hat until it is the desired length. Start each round with 2 chain stitches, then do 1 double crochet in each space all around. You aren't adding any increases to these rounds, so your hat will start to form a tube shape. Finish off with a border using single crochets. Start of with 1 chain stitch, then do a single crochet in each space. Do this for 2 rows, then finish off with a slip stitch. Tie the end off, then weave it into the brim of your beanie using a yarn needle. Your beanie is now done and ready to wear! If you'd like, you can turn the bottom up by a few inches/centimeters) to create a brim, or even add a pompom to the top! Making a Slouchy Beanie Begin with a chain circle. Do 5 chain stitches, then make a slip stitch into the first chain to close the ring. Use a size H/8 or 5.0mm crochet hook and medium worsted weight yarn for this. Make 11 double crochet stitches into the middle of your circle. Start with 2 chain stitches. This will count as your first double crochet stitch. Next, do 11 more double crochets, pulling each one through the center of the circle. Close the round off with a slip stitch into the top of your first stitch (the double chain stitch). This completes round 1. Do not turn your project. Mark the beginning and end of your round with a stitch marker. If you can't find one, you can use a piece of yarn in a contrasting color or a safety pin. Do a round of 2 double crochets. Start 2 chain stitches. Next, do 2 double crochets in each stitch for the rest of the round. Close with a slip stitch into the top of your first stitch. This completes round 2. Start doing your first increasing round. Start with 2 chain stitches and 1 double crochet in the first stitch. Do 2 double crochet stitches in the second stitch. Next, do 1 double crochet stitch for the next 2 stitches. Repeat the last 4 stitches (2 double crochet in the same stitch, 1 double crochet for the next 2 stitches) until you reach the end of the round. Close the round with a slip stitch. This completes your third round. Continue doing your increases for rounds 4 through 8. Start each round with 2 chain stitches; this will count as your first \"double crochet.\" Do 1 double crochet in the first stitch, and 2 double crochets in the second stitch. Next, do x-number of double crochets over x-number of stitches. Repeat the last few stitches (2 double crochets in 1 stitch, x-number of double crochets), until you reach the end of the round. Close each round with a slip stitch. The number \"x\" will increase with each round. For example:\nRound 4: After 2 chain stitches and 1 double crochet, repeat 2 double crochets in the same stitch, then 1 double crochet over the next 3 stitches. Round 5: After 2 chain stitches and 1 double crochet, repeat 2 double crochets in the same stitch, then 1 double crochet over the next 4 stitches. Round 6: After 2 chain stitches and 1 double crochet, repeat 2 double crochets in the same stitch, then 1 double crochet over the next 5 stitches. Round 7: After 2 chain stitches and 1 double crochet, repeat 2 double crochets in the same stitch, then 1 double crochet over the next 6 stitches. Round 8: After 2 chain stitches and 1 double crochet, repeat 2 double crochets in the same stitch, then 1 double crochet over the next 7 stitches. Work the body of your hat. On your 9th round, chain stitch 2, then do 1 double crochet in each stitch for the rest of the round. Close with a slip stitch. Keep doing this for the next 18 rounds or so (until round 28). If this is for a child, consider doing 10 rounds. Start doing the band of your hat with single crochets. Begin with 1 chain stitch, then do single crochets for the rest of the round. Close the round off with a slip stitch. Work on your decreasing round. Start with 1 chain stitch. Next, do 1 single crochet for the next 5 stitches. Do 1 single crochet decrease over your 6th stitch. Continue doing 5 single crochets, 1 single crochet decrease, for the rest of the round. Close the round with a slip stitch. Here are some extra sizing tips:\nIf this is for a child, do 5 single crochets, then 2 single crochet decreases. If this is for a larger head, do 10 single crochet stitches, then 1 single crochet decrease. If this is for an extra large head, don't do any decreases. Simply work more single crochets into the round. Finish the round off with a single crochet into each stitch. Start with 1 chain stitch, then do a single crochet into each stitch for the rest of the round. Close the round off with a slip stitch. Tie the end off, then use a yarn needle to weave the tail end into the brim of your hat. Your slouchy hat is now complete! You can leave it as is, or add some embroidery into the brim using contrasting yarn and a yarn needle. You can also sew a large, decorative button, bow, or flower into the band instead. Making a Baby Beanie Start with a chain circle. Use a size G/6 or 4.0mm crochet hook and fine, baby or sports weight yarn to make 4 chain stitches. Close the chain by making a slip stitch through both loops of the first chain. Make 13 double crochet stitches through the middle of your circle. Start by making 2 chain stitches. Next, make 13 double crochet stitches through the center of your ring. Use your fingers to spread the stitches evenly around the ring. Close the round with a slip stitch. Be sure to pull the slip stitch through both loops of your first double crochet. This finishes off the first round, for a total of 13 stitches. This excludes the first 2 chain stitches. Do not turn your work around. Use a stitch marker to mark the beginning and end of your row. If you don't have one, you can use a safety pin or a piece of yarn in a contrasting color. Make 2 double crochet stitches into each stitch, then close the round off with a slip stitch. This finishes off the second round, for a total of 26 stitches. If you are using a stitch marker, be sure to move it into place! Start your first increasing round. Begin with 2 chain stitches, then 1 double crochet in the first stitch. Follow up with 2 double crochets in the second stitch. Repeat the last 3 stitches (1 double crochet in 1 stitch, 2 double crochets in 1 stitch) for the rest of the round. Close the round off with a slip stitch for a total of 39 stitches. Do your second increasing round. Start with 2 chain stitches, then make 1 double crochet stitch in the first and second stitch. Follow up with 2 double crochets in the third stitch. Repeat the last four stitches (1 double crochet over the next 2 stitches, then 2 double crochets in the same stitch) until you reach the end of the round. Close the round with a slip stitch. You'll have 52 stitches total. If your baby has a larger head, add another increasing round. This time, do 1 double crochet for 3 stitches, followed by 2 double crochets in the same stitch. Start building the body of your hat. Begin with 2 chain stitches, then do 1 double crochet into each stitch for the rest of the round. Close the round with a slip stitch. You'll have the same number of stitches as before: 52. All proceeding rounds will have the same number of stitches. If you added another increasing round, you'll have the same number of stitches as that round. Repeat the previous round 8 more times. Begin each round with 2 chain stitches, then work 1 double crochet into each stitch. Finish each round with a slip stitch. Don't turn your work at all while making these rounds. You want a total of 13 rounds. If your baby has a larger head, consider adding another round to add extra length to the hat. Start doing your brim. Do 2 chain stitches, then turn your work. Do 1 double crochet in each stitch for the rest of the round. Close the round with a slip stitch. Don't turn your work after this. Repeat the previous round, but don't turn your work. Do 2 chain stitches, then make 1 double crochet into each stitch. Close the round with a slip stitch. Do not turn your work. Finish the hat off with an edging. Start off by doing 1 chain stitch. Next, alternate between doing 1 single crochet and 1 chain stitch. Do not skip any stitches. This will give you a fancy little bump. Close the round off with a slip stitch in the first single crochet that you did. Cut the yarn, tie the end off, then weave the tail into the edging. Turn the brim up by the last 3 rows (where you first turned your work). Your baby beanie is now complete! If you'd like, you can add a cute, felt appliqu\u00e9 to the brim, or a fluffy pompom to the top!",
