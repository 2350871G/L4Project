        "Topstitch it down as close to the inside folded edge as you can.",
        "Use a thread color that matches the rest of the topstitching on your skirt.",

        "Making a Midi Skirt Get a pair of jeans that fit you.",

        "You can use this method to make a mini skirt too.",
        "Cut apart the inside seam.",
        "Begin cutting from the bottom part of one cuff all the way up to the crotch.",
        "Continue cutting along the seam down to the other cuff.",
        "Cut apart the front and back seams so that they lay flat.",
        "The crotch part on jeans is typically curved, but it needs to lay flat for a skirt.",
        "Cut along the back seam until the curved part ends.",
        "This will typically be about 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters).",
        "You should be able to overlap the left and right edges and smooth them down without any puckering.Repeat this step for the front crotch seam, if necessary.",
        "Sew the front and back crotch seams down.",
        "Overlap the two edges on the front crotch seam until they lay smooth.",
        "Topstitch them down using the same thread color as the original top stitching.",
        "Try follow the original stitching as much as possible.",
        "Trim off the excess fabric from the front flap.",
        "Repeat this process for the back seam.",
        "Cut the legs off where you want the skirt to end.",
        "Cut no further than halfway down the pant leg.",
        "If you cut too much off, you won't have enough fabric to fill the gap in.",
        "If you want a longer skirt, use the maxi skirt method instead, then cut it shorter at the end.",
        "If you want to hem the bottom of the skirt, cut the skirt 1\u00bd inches (3.81 centimeters) longer than you want it to be.",
        "Be sure to leave enough fabric on the pant legs to fill the gaps in.",

        "Topstitch the panels down.",
        "Sew \u00bd-inch (1.27 centimeters) away from the raw, cut edge.",
        "You can use the same thread color as the jeans or a contrasting color.",
        "You can also match the thread color to the original topstitching thread on the jeans.",
        "In most cases, this will be orange or yellow.",
        "Turn the jeans inside out and cut off the excess fabric.",
        "Leave about a \u00bd-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance.",

        "The skirt is now ready to wear!",
        "Making a Maxi Skirt Get two pairs of jeans.",
        "They can be exactly the same shade, or they can be two different shades.",
        "Make sure that at least one of the jeans fits you well, as this will be the top of the skirt.",
        "Cut open the inside seam on the first pair of jeans.",
        "Take the pair of jeans that fit you.",
        "Starting from one cuff, cut up along the inside seam until you reach the crotch.",

        "Cut apart the crotch seam when you are done.",
        "Cut up partway on the front and back seams.",
        "You may have noticed that the crotch part on the front and back seams is curving outward.",
        "It needs to lay flat.",

        "Overlap the left and right edges on the front crotch seam until it lays smooth.",
        "Topstitch it down, following the original stitching.",
        "Trim off the excess fabric from the top flap.",
        "Repeat this step for the back seam.",
        "Chop the legs off of the second pair of jeans.",
        "You will be using these legs to fill the gaps on your skirt.",
        "Cut up past the crotch to ensure that you have enough fabric.",
        "Cut apart one of the legs on both seams on the second pair of jeans.",
        "You will be left with two panels: a front one and a back one.",
        "Pick a panel to use for the front of your skirt.",
        "Set the second panel aside for another project.",
        "Slice the second leg apart on the outside seam.",
        "This will create a wider panel, which you will be using this for the back of the skirt.",
        "Do not cut the leg apart on the inside seam.",
        "Spread the first pair of jeans out.",
        "Set the first pair of jeans down in front of you, with the right side facing out and the waistband facing away from you.",
        "Smooth the legs down so that they lay flat against your work surface.",
        "You will have a triangular-shaped hole between both legs.",
        "Do not close this hole up.",
        "You will fill it in with the panels.",
        "Pin the panels inside the jeans to fill in the gaps.",

        "Make sure that the bottom cuffs match up and that the side edges overlap.",
        "Smooth down the crotch so that it lays flat; you will need to overlap the left and right edges.",
        "Pin the panel in place.",
        "Repeat this step for the back of the jeans with the wider panels.You may have to scoot the legs closer together.",
        "You need the inside seams on the legs to overlap the outside seams on the panel.",
        "If you have a gap on top, fill it in with a patch of denim fabric.",
        "Don't pin the right sides together like regular sewing.",
        "You want the raw, cut edges on the first pair of jeans to be visible.",

        "Backstitch at the start and end of your sewing.",
        "Cut the hem off, if desired.",
