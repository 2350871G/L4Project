If you live near a farmer's market, vendors there may also sell pumpkins. Find a location with a healthy selection of pumpkins and a range of sizes. If you're pumpkin hunting with young children, a pumpkin patch may be the most fun for them.

Look for a sturdy stem that doesn't feel too bendable, and for a mostly consistent color all the way around. Knock or thump on the skin like you would a melon; if you hear a hollow sound, the pumpkin is ripe. Look for a pumpkin with a flat base. This will make it easier to display the carved pumpkin on Halloween night. It's not important if the pumpkin you like is clean or dirty. Remember you can always wash the pumpkin with an old cloth when you get home."

A few popular carving options include:\nCarve a traditional jack-o'-lantern. Plan to cut out eyes, a mouth, and perhaps a nose. This design is easiest for beginners. Carve a silhouette. Pick a shape\u2014for instance, a ghost\u2014and carve out the \u201cnegative space\u201d around the ghost's shape, then carve out features like eyes or a mouth. You'll end up with a circle of light around the dark shape, with lighted details. Carve down to the pulp. For a daytime jack-o'-lantern that you don't intend to light, use an x-acto knife to scratch away the pumpkin skin and reveal the pulp. Don't carve all the way into the gourd."
