To do this you need to understand what net carbs are. Net carbs simply represent the total carbohydrate content of food after you have deducted the fiber content and any sugar alcohols. You only need to count net carbs instead of total carbohydrates because these are what significantly impact your blood sugar level. Foods which are low in net carbs don\u2019t have a major impact on your blood sugar level, and as such are less likely to disrupt your weight loss.
