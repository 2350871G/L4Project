Work on your project outdoors, in a work room with windows, or in a garage with the door open. You should also wear a dust mask and thick, waterproof gloves. Put down a plastic sheet or drop cloth to protect the work area. Place the lockers on a plastic or cloth sheet to protect the floor. If you're worried about nearby walls or shelving, hang protective coverings over them.Drop cloths or plastic will protect your floor and walls from paint splatter and cleaning chemicals. Clean all surfaces with a solvent, such as acetone. Even if the lockers look relatively clean, you still need to remove traces of grease and dirt. Otherwise, the paint won\u2019t adhere properly. Soak a scouring pad with acetone or another solvent cleaner, scrub the lockers thoroughly, then wipe them down with a clean, damp cloth.Wear gloves when you use a solvent cleaner.
