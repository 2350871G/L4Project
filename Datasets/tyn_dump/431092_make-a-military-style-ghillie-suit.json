        "~10 Burlap Sacks - The more material you have on your ghillie suit, the less your outline will resemble a human figure, thus providing better camouflage. Try starting with about 10 sacks worth of ghillie and adding more if necessary (depending on your size and preference of camouflage to weight of suit ratio). You can get burlap sacks from shipping supply or feed stores for about $1/sack.",
        "Optional: Fabric dye - You'll want colors that match the environment in which you'll be using your ghillie suit. For example, the color of burlap (without dye) works very well for some desert and Mediterranean climates. However, if you're using your ghillie suit in a wooded or marshy area, you'll likely want to purchase green and/or brown dyes to complement the tan of the burlap. You can buy fabric dye at fabric supply stores or even some supermarkets.",
