There's no need to get up early when you're sick. Have a quiet time where nobody is around to be loud. Shut off the TV and don't use electronic devices. Relax as best you can. Do some yoga, stretching, or meditation. Don't do anything that feels uncomfortable or increases the symptoms of your sickness. Go rest outside! If it's not cold where you live, go out and get some fresh air and sit! It's really peaceful and you can look at any wildlife you see. You can even just relax on your porch. Gather all of the things you will want in the day. This includes tissues, cough drops, snacks, TV remotes, etc. Set up camp on the couch and be lazy all day. Watch some of your favorite TV shows.
