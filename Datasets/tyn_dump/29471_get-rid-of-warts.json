Repeat three times a day. Use hot water and pumice. Soak the wart in hot water until it softens. Scrape it down with a piece of coarse exfoliating pumice until you reach level with the skin. Take bleach on a cotton swab and hold it against the wart for 15 minutes (this may sting a bit). You must wash the area well after applying bleach. Apply tea tree oil. Dab a little on the wart and cover with a strip bandage. Do this for up to three weeks. Try castor oil. The acid in castor oil irritates the wart and works best on small, flat warts on the face and back of hands. Apply castor oil to the wart with a cotton swab twice a day. Use aspirin. Take a few aspirins and crunch them up, adding a few drops of water. Take the mixture and put it onto the effected wart areas, then apply an adhesive bandage.. Leave on overnight. Aspirin is the ingestible form of salicylic acid, but much cheaper than most commercial lotions. Try some Betadine (iodine). Also called iodine, apply the Betadine to the wart and cover with a bandage and leave for one or two days then refresh bandage. Put toothpaste on the wart and apply an adhesive bandage. Leave for a day and repeat until the wart is gone. Using Unverified Food Remedies Use a citrus peel. Cut a section of lemon or lime peel slightly larger than the wart and tape it over with an adhesive bandage or tape. Refresh the peel every day or so and keep the wart covered for as long as possible. After about a week or so, the entire wart will come out completely. Use basil. Tape crushed, fresh basil to your wart using waterproof first-aid tape. Do this daily for up to a week. The virus-killing compound in the basil leaf will kill your wart. Take garlic capsules. Do this twice a day for at least several weeks. Warts should start peeling off in one or two weeks, but take the garlic until the wart disappears. You can also cover the wart with garlic oil once or twice daily for a month. Eat immune system-strengthening foods. Garlic, sweet potatoes, whole-grain breads, sunflower seeds and rice are all examples of this. Cut up carrots. Finely grate a carrot and add enough olive oil to it to make a paste. Dab the paste on your wart twice daily for 30 minutes. Do this for two to three weeks. Make a fig mask. Mash up a fresh fig and place some on your wart for 30 minutes. Do this daily for two to three weeks. Use lemon juice. Squeeze lemon juice on your wart, then cover it with fresh, chopped onions. Do this for 30 minutes once a day for two to three weeks. Put it in pineapple juice. Soak your wart in pineapple juice. It has a dissolving enzyme. Rub daily with the inside of a banana peel. The potassium may help speed the disappearance of the wart. Bind your wart with a banana peel. Cut out a section of the peel so it's slightly smaller than the tape you'll be using. Rub the inside of a banana peel onto the wart and then secure with duct tape. Keep it on the wart for a day before removing. Repeat until wart is fully removed. Create a preparation of curcumin. Curcumin is a turmeric extract that can be found in health food stores. Combine curcumin, papaya extract (Papain. It may have to be purchased in pill form and crushed into powder), and vitamin E oil. Dab the wart and surrounding area with alcoholic extract of golden seal. This will stimulate local immune activity. Take a sharp needle or pin and dip it into the curcumin paste. Press the needle as deep into the wart as possible. Continue injecting more of the paste into the wart, poking several holes if necessary. Spread the remaining paste over the wart area and cover with medical tape. This technique is effective against flat warts, which are found on the face and hands. Flat warts are notoriously stubborn and will often remain on the skin after the body has acquired resistance to the virus. This will finish the warts off in lieu of freezing. Use apple cider vinegar. Take a cotton ball (only enough to cover the wart) and soak it in the vinegar. Secure with a band aid overnight. Keep in mind that this might be very painful. Change the cotton pad daily and keep it on every night if you can. After one week, the body of the wart will start to peel off and you can gently scrape it away to reveal healthy flesh beneath. Let the area heal once this is done. Trying Gentler Methods for Removal Use warm water and sea salt. Soak the wart for 10 to 15 minutes in warm salt water to moisten the skin. Scrape the dead skin layers off the wart using a nail file, pumice stone or mild sandpaper. You could also use your fingers, but wash them thoroughly before and after, as warts can easily spread. Moisten the wart and apply a large flake of sea salt to it. Put a band-aid or tape over the wart to hold the salt in place and observe for several days, replacing it after you shower or if it falls off. Mix up baking powder. Mix baking powder and castor oil into a paste, then apply it to the wart at night by covering it with a bandage. Remove the bandage the next morning. Repeat as necessary. Use hot water. Soaking plantar warts in very hot water is helpful because it softens the wart and may kill the virus. Make sure the water is not hot enough to cause burns\u2014keep it under 140\u00b0F (60\u00b0C). Apply dandelion sap. Pick a fresh dandelion and Break the stem. Apply the milky sap that oozes from the stem onto the wart. Repeat this three or four times a day. Scrape the wart with pumice to remove dead layers of skin. Continue doing this until the wart fades away. Causes and Types of Warts Avoid touching warts as much as possible.
