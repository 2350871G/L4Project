You can create your design by drawing it freehand, using a stencil, or even using a die-cutting machine if you have one. Outdoor vinyl is waterproof, making it the best choice for use on drinkware. You can purchase outdoor vinyl at a craft or home supply store. Die-cutting machines often have pre-programmed designs for you to choose from, but you may be able to create an original design by experimenting with the software. Try tracing out letters to create a monogram, or use different colors of vinyl to create colorful hearts or polka dots. Cut out your applique using sharp scissors or a craft knife. Once you have the design how you want it, carefully cut along the edges. Use caution when cutting with scissors or a craft knife, and never allow small children to handle sharp objects. Lay transfer tape over the top of your graphic. Transfer tape is made to help you apply decals evenly.

Once you remove the transfer tape, your design is finished! The outdoor vinyl should be long-lasting, although you may want to wash your tumbler by hand to help preserve your decal. Customizing a Photo Tumbler Purchase a clear acrylic tumbler to show off your favorite pictures. Acrylic photo tumblers are popular, inexpensive, and easy to customize. Make sure you choose a tumbler which unscrews to give you access to the photo compartment. You can purchase these tumblers at craft stores and big box stores. Print your design onto photo paper or cardstock. Since these tumblers are slightly tapered at the bottom, you will need to cut the paper so it can be rolled into a cone shape.

        "Painting Your Tumbler Use spray paint if you want to paint a stainless steel tumbler.",
        "Regular spray paint will adhere best to the smooth surface of a steel tumbler, but you\u2019ll need to scuff the surface slightly for the best results.",
        "Apply chalk paint to your steel tumbler using a foam brush if you don't want to use spray paint.",
        "You can use acrylic paint or markers to paint an acrylic tumbler, but even with sealant, the paint will have a tendency to flake off over time.",
        "Scuff the surface of the tumbler with 140-180 grit sandpaper.",
        "Roughing up the surface a little will help the paint stick to it better, so your design will last longer.",
        "Depending on the grit of the sandpaper you use, you should only need about 5-10 passes with the sandpaper to get the texture you need.",
        "Try to only sand the area you\u2019re planning on painting, otherwise it will be visible after your project is completed.",
        "Wipe down the tumbler with alcohol to remove dirt and oils.",
        "Even if it\u2019s not visible, dirt and oils may be present on your tumbler from where you or other people have handled it.",
        "Use an alcohol pad or a cotton ball soaked in alcohol to wipe down your tumbler, then let it dry completely.",
        "Apply the stencil to the tumbler if you\u2019re using one.",

        "Peel the backing off the the stencil and attach it to the tumbler, smoothing out any bumps or winkles.",
        "If there are any gaps or wrinkles in the stencil, paint can seep underneath it and mess up your design.",
        "Spray light coats of paint, letting each coat dry before applying the next.",
        "If you apply too much paint at once, it could start to bubble and drip.",
        "To avoid this, hold the spray paint can at least 6\u20138 inches (15\u201320 cm) away from the tumbler, and only spray in short, quick bursts.",
        "Move the can side to side as you spray to keep the paint from pooling in one area.",
        "Allow the paint to dry for at least 10 minutes between coats.",
        "After the final coat, let the tumbler dry for 2-3 hours.",
        "If you used a stencil, remove it before the tumbler has fully dried so the paint doesn't peel off.",
        "Layer colors if you want to create an ombre effect.",
        "Hold the spray paint about 8\u201310 inches (20\u201325 cm) from the tumbler.",
        "Use a darker color to spray the bottom and a lighter color on the top, and let the 2 colors overlap slightly.",
        "Try pairing 2 shades of the same color, like turquoise and sea green.",
        "You could also contrast 2 different colors for a more striking effect, like red on the bottom and yellow on the top.",
        "Spray the tumbler with a paint sealer to lock in the paint.",
        "A paint sealer is a clear coat that will help create a barrier that will prevent the paint from flaking off.",
        "You can purchase this wherever you bought your painting supplies.",
        "Spray the sealer evenly over the tumbler, using the same side-to-side motion you used while painting.",
        "Let the sealer dry for an additional 2-3 hours.",
