                    "description": "One of the biggest causes of teenage acne is increased oil production based on hormonal changes. Washing your face once a day can still leave oil and dirt behind to clog pores. Instead wash once in the morning and once in the evening with warm water and a mild oil-free cleanser. Use clean fingertips and not a washcloth to clean your face. Do not use a regular bar soap or body wash. Always use a gentle cleanser especially formulated for facial skin. Do not over wash. Washing the face more than twice a day can dry out the skin, which can actually cause the oil glands to go into overdrive production and make the acne worse. It can take anywhere from four-to-eight weeks of a daily regimen before you notice a significant difference."

The two most commonly used OTC acne treatments are benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid. OTC medications come in gels, lotions, creams, soaps, and pads. Gels and creams are good for spot treatments of problem areas whereas pads, soaps, and lotions are more commonly used on the entire face. In addition to clearing pores, benzoyl peroxide has antibacterial qualities that makes it more difficult for the acne-causing p. acnes bacteria. And benzoyl peroxide reduces inflammation (which causes redness and swelling) of the skin. Benzoyl peroxide formulations are usually a 2.5% to 10% solution and salicylic acid formulations are usually 2% solutions."
