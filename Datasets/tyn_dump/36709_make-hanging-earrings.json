Alternative \"Jump Ring\" Technique Follow instructions 1 to 3 as above, but skip step 4 above by not cutting the pin yet.  Bend the head pin all the way around, then wrap it several times around the pin where it just comes out of the bead. Cut the excess and tuck the end in so that it does not stick out.
