    "text": " Passionfruit jam Wash the passionfruit well. Then cut in halves. Scoop the pulp out of the passionfruit. Put the pulp in a bowl and set aside. Cover half of the passionfruit shells in water. Let sit overnight. Add the soaked passionfruit shells and the soaking water to a large preserving pan or heavy based saucepan. Boil for 30 minutes or until the inner part softens. Scoop out the additional pulp and throw away the shells. Chop up the retrieved pulp. Mix the pulp, passionfruit flesh and water in a preserving pan or large heavy-based saucepan. Bring to the boil. Add the sugar and lemon juice. Stir to dissolve. Boil quickly until it reaches setting point. See How to do a setting test for details. Transfer to sterilized jam jars. Seal, label and date. Keep in a cool and dry place. The jam will keep for a year or two. Refrigerate after opening. Passionfruit peach jam Prepare the peaches. Peel and cut them into chunks. Place a layer of chunks into a large bowl. Sprinkle sugar over the top. Add another layer and sprinkle with sugar again. Continue until all the chunks are used up. Let the sugar soak into the peaches overnight. Leave in the refrigerator, covered. Add the peaches to a large preserving pan or heavy-based saucepan. Cook until soft. When softened, add the remaining sugar and the passionfruit pulp. Briefly warm the lemon juice and add it too. Stir through. Boil the mixture quickly. Test for setting point, when a gel forms; this stage will be reached after about 15 to 25 minutes of cooking. If gelling isn't occurring, add more lemon juice. Sterilize the jam jars during the boiling of the jam. Pour the jam into sterilized jars. Seal, label and date. Store in a cool, dry and dark place for 1 to 2 years. Passionfruit curd jam Pour all of the ingredients into a mixing bowl.  Whisk together.  Pour whisked mixture into a double boiler.
