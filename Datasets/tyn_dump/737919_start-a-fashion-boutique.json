It's important to have a theme to your style, as being too eclectic will discourage customers as they won't be sure what to expect, although you can be eclectic if you run a quality recycled clothing boutique. Note down the style and clothes you'd like in your boutique. Create lists of ideas and your thoughts. Be practical and logical. While you may love a particular style, is it one that will attract sufficient customers in your area? For example, you may love hippy gear but how many hippies are in your area waiting to buy it?"
