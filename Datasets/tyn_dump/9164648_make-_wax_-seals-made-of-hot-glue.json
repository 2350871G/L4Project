        "Make sure it is completely dry before attempting to stamp the glue.",
        "Cut off a chunk of a glue stick and put it in a wax melting spoon.",
        "Use scissors to cut about \u20444 in (1.9 cm) off the end of a glue stick designed for use in a glue gun.",
        "You will need to melt it down in a metal melting spoon shaped like a scoop.",
        "It\u2019s wider and deeper than regular kitchen spoons.",
        "Choose a glue stick according to the color of stamp you wish to make.",
        "If you can\u2019t find colored glue sticks, try melting part of a crayon with an equal amount of a white glue stick.",
        "Stir them together to create colored glue.",
        "An advantage to using a spoon is that it allows you to create unique colors by melting different glue sticks together.",
        "Heat the glue over a tea candle until it is completely liquid.",
        "Light a small candle with a match to provide a convenient little heat source for melting glue.",
        "Hold the spoon directly over the flame.",
        "The glue will melt relatively quickly.",
        "Make sure it is has a uniform, liquid consistency before pouring it out of the spoon.",
        "Wax melting spoons are available online and at some craft supply stores.",
        "Melt enough glue to fill the bowl of the spoon.",
        "Cut off more glue and melt it as needed if the bowl isn\u2019t full.",
        "Stirring the glue with a toothpick speeds up the melting process and helps ensure the liquid isn\u2019t chunky.",
        "Pour the glue out onto an envelope or another surface.",
        "Tip the spoon over and pour the hot glue onto any surface you desire.",
        "Add it directly to your project or put it on a non-stick surface first.",
        "Non-stick surfaces like silicone mats and wax paper are great ways to practice making seals before using them to finish projects.",
        "The easiest way to pour the glue is in a mound.",
        "Move the spoon slightly to help spread the glue.",
        "Since the glue is liquid, it will finish spreading and settling on its own.",
        "If you choose to pour the wax onto a non-stick surface, you will need to attach the seal to your project with an adhesive like hot glue or a double-sided sticker.",
        "Press a wax seal stamp into the hot glue before it dries.",
        "Don\u2019t wait too long to apply your stamp!",
        "Push the stamp into the glue as soon as you finish pouring it.",
        "Hold the stamp in place for about 5 seconds, then remove it.",
        "If your \u201cwax\u201d seal sticks to the stamp, push it off with your finger and use an adhesive to bind it to your project.",
        "Heat the spoon\u2019s bowl again to clean it with a paper towel.",
        "When you\u2019re done making seals, clean out the bowl to avoid it becoming crusty with old glue or coloring.",
        "Hold it over the tea candle until the glue becomes liquid again.",
        "Then, mop up the remaining glue.",
        "As long as you don\u2019t boil the glue, neither the spoon nor the glue will pose much of a burn risk.",
        "Still, play it safe and avoid letting hot surfaces brush against your skin.",
        "Melting Glue Sticks over Heat Turn on a butane lighter and hold a glue stick over it.",
        "Any type of lighter or heat source works, but butane lighters are the most effective.",
        "Move the lighter or torch so the flame isn't directly over it.",
        "Use your other hand to hold a glue gun glue stick above the tip of the flame.",
        "Melting glue sticks this way is tricky since the glue tends to drip on the lighter.",
        "Get a torch lighter instead of a disposable lighter if you can.",
        "Torch lighters are far easier to aim.",
        "Drip the wax onto a silicon mat or another surface.",
        "Move the glue stick around to create a circle about the size of a large coin or whatever wax seal stamp you plan on using.",
        "Letting most of the glue drip into a mound is fine.",
        "It will flow out to fill in most of the circle.",
        "Let the wax melt onto envelopes or wherever you need the seal.",
        "Alternatively, use a non-stick surface like a silicone craft mat to practice and select the perfect seal for your project.",
        "Dripping glue is the slowest way to create a seal, so be patient.",
        "Hold the glue stick steady until it gets nice and hot, then make sure the melting glue drips where you need it.",
        "Spread the wax around by rubbing it with the glue sick if needed.",
        "Press the end of the glue stick against the hot glue.",
        "Use the glue stick to move the glue around, spreading it out to make the seal look smooth and even.",
        "Doing this isn\u2019t necessary, but it is a useful way to cover up mistakes and make your seal look more consistent.",
        "Rub the glue stick gently against the surface to avoid spreading the glue out too much.",
        "For the best results, spread the glue with circular motions.",
        "Imperfections in the seal are fine and make it unique.",
        "Most seals look noticeably different from one another, so you don\u2019t need to spend a lot of time fixing dripped glue.",
        "Stamp the glue with a slightly moistened wax seal stamp.",
        "Set the glue stick and torch aside.",
        "Get a sponge or rag dampened in cold water.",
        "Dab some of the moisture onto your chosen stamp, enough to coat the metal portion without it dripping water.",
        "Then, press the stamp into the glue to form the seal.",
        "Hold the stamp in place for about 5 seconds, enough for the \u201cwax\u201d seal to solidify."
