Before you begin to lift your car and locate the oxygen sensor, put on a sturdy pair of work gloves to protect your hands. You should also wear a pair of protective eyeglasses or goggles in case any WD-40 or gasoline comes near your eyes. Both work gloves and protective eyewear can be purchased at your local hardware store, or at a large retail store such as a WalMart."

Check your vehicle's owner's manual for the exact locations of the sensors. All vehicles have at least two oxygen sensors: one in front of your car's catalytic converter, and one in the car's exhaust manifold. If your vehicle has more than one exhaust manifold, there will likely be an oxygen sensor inside each one. The oxygen sensor will look something like a spark plug: roughly 2 inches (5 cm) long. One end will have a hexagon shape\u2014for a wrench to fit over\u2014and the other end will be threaded to screw into your vehicle."
