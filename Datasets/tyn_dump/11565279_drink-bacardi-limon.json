Slowly pour the Bacardi Limon into your glass to avoid spills. Then, enjoy your Bacardi Limon neat. You can also measure the Bacardi by eye and simply fill the bottom 1/8 of your glass. Exact measurements aren\u2019t as important when it comes to pouring neat pours since you aren\u2019t mixing anything. The term \u201cneat\u201d is used in bartending to refer to a drink that is not mixed or poured over ice. A jigger is a bartending tool that looks like 2 cones connected to one another. The smaller cone-shaped cup is usually a 1  fl oz (30 mL) measurement, while the bigger cup is measures out 2  fl oz (59 mL). While a lowball glass is ideal for neat pours of spirits, you can use any kind of glass that you\u2019d like. A lowball glass is also known as an Old Fashioned glass or tumbler."
