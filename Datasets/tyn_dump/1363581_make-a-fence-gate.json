If you do not have an existing fence to attach the gate to, you will need to build one, as fence posts are necessary for installing a fence. Mark the spot where the gate fence posts will go into the ground. If you do not already have fence posts in place, you will need posts in order to install a gate. Make small indentations in the ground with your trowel. Check for utilities. Before any digging takes place, call a utility location service to locate pipes, cables, and other underground hazards. You can call the toll-free number \"811\" for this service from anywhere in the US and Canada. Consider an H-brace fence. If the fence is not yet built, you can build it in an \"H-brace\" style, with single crossbeams and horizontal tensioned wires connecting the posts. For the gate posts, use posts 1.5 to 2 times the diameter of the other fence posts, and attach them to the nearest fence post using a tensioned wire strung diagonally from the bottom of the gate post to the top of the other post. Dig a trench across the gate opening instead. If you are not building an H-brace fence, you can reinforce the gate posts with a concrete base instead. Begin by digging a trench 12\" (30 cm) wide across the gate opening, and at least 18\" (46 cm) deep. Brace the posts in position. Place the two gate posts in opposite ends of the trench. Plumb them with a bubble level to make sure they are as vertical as possible. Brace them in place by nailing two angled 2 x 4s onto adjacent sides of each post, stabilizing them against the ground. Add optional wooden reinforcement. For additional stability, you can lay pressure treated 2\" x 4\" boards across the entire length of the trench base. Nail them to the sides of the two posts. Mix concrete. A fast-setting concrete mix or any basic Portland cement mix will do. You'll need roughly one bag per post. Pour concrete into the trench. Cover the entire base of the trench with a layer of concrete 4\u20136\" (10\u201315 cm) deep. Let the concrete cure. Wait at least 24 hours for the concrete to cure, or as directed on the bag. Fill the trench with gravel. Pour gravel to ground level to further reinforce the posts. Building the Gate Cut top and bottom gate boards. Cut two 2\" x 4\" boards to 2 in. (or 4 cm) shorter than the distance between the posts. For example, if you want a gate that spans 36 in. (or 92 cm), cut the boards to 34 in. (or 88 cm).

These can be butted against each other or spaced evening or unevenly, depending on your preferred look. Attaching the Gate Secure one side of the hinges onto one of the fence posts. Usually, simply screwing the hinges into the fence post will suffice. Attach the gate in a level position. Use a bubble level across the top of gate to confirm it will be perfectly horizontal once attached. If the hinge placement does not need adjusting, screw the hinges onto one of the vertical boards of your gate. If your gate has a diagonal brace, the lower side of the brace should be next to the hinges. Test the gate.
