If you are working with a square in the real world, use a ruler or piece of measuring tape to find the length. Since all four sides of the square are the same length, you can use any side of the square. If you do not know the length of one side of the square, you cannot use this method. For example, you might want to find the length of the diagonal of a square that has sides 5 centimeters long. Set up the formula d=s2{\\displaystyle d=s{\\sqrt {2}}}. In the formula d{\\displaystyle d} equals the length of the diagonal and s{\\displaystyle s} equals one side of the square. This formula is derived from the Pythagorean Theorem (a2+b2=c2){\\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2})}. A diagonal divides a square into two congruent right triangles, thus, you can use the side lengths of the square to find the length of the diagonal (which would be the hypotenuse of the right triangle). Plug the side length of the square into the formula. Make sure you are substituting for the variable s{\\displaystyle s}. For example, if the square has a side length of 5 centimeters, set up the formula like this:d=52{\\displaystyle d=5{\\sqrt {2}}} Multiply the length of the side by 2{\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {2}}}.

If You Know the Perimeter Set up the formula for the perimeter of a square. The formula is P=4s{\\displaystyle P=4s}, where P{\\displaystyle P} equals the perimeter of the square, and s{\\displaystyle s} equals the length of one side of the square. This method only works if you are given the perimeter of the square. To find the length of the diagonal, you must first find the length of one side of the square, so you need to set up the perimeter formula and solve for s{\\displaystyle s}. Plug the length of the perimeter into the formula. Make sure you are substituting for the variable P{\\displaystyle P}. For example, if the perimeter of the square is 20 centimeters, your formula will look like this:20=4s{\\displaystyle 20=4s} Solve for s{\\displaystyle s}. To do this, divide each side of the equation by 4. This will give you the length of one side of the square. For example:20=4s{\\displaystyle 20=4s}204=4s4{\\displaystyle {\\frac {20}{4}}={\\frac {4s}{4}}}5=s{\\displaystyle 5=s} Set up the formula d=s2{\\displaystyle d=s{\\sqrt {2}}}.

If You Know the Area Set up the formula for the area of a square. The formula is A=s2{\\displaystyle A=s^{2}}, where A{\\displaystyle A} equals the area of the square, and s{\\displaystyle s} equals the length of one side of the square. This method only works if you are given the area of the square.

For example, if the area of the square is 25 square centimeters, your formula will look like this:25=s2{\\displaystyle 25=s^{2}} Solve for s{\\displaystyle s}. To do this, find the square root of the area. This will give you the length of one side of the square. To find the square root, use a calculator.
