Continue pulling the carpet back, cutting it up into smaller strips and rolling it up. Remove any carpet padding in the same manner and cut it up into strips that can easily be transported. Although NuCore can't be installed over carpet, it can be installed over even concrete, wood, vinyl, linoleum, and ceramic tile floors. Remove any remaining carpet tack strips and staples from the carpet pad when you're done. Slide a pry bar under the nails that secure the strips and lift them up. For staples, pull them up with pliers and use a flat-bladed screwdriver to pull them out."

For example, if you need to cut 1 inch (2.5 cm) from your 6 inch (15 cm) first row planks, they should all be 5 inches (13 cm) in width after cutting. Laying down Your First Row Lay down the first plank flush into the leftmost corner of the room. Place a \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) plastic spacer against the left wall. Spacers are essential for helping you align your tiles as you go, and provide room for trim molding installation. Plastic spacers can be purchased from home hardware stores. Leave the front wall without spacers for now\u2014you will only need them later. Lay down the second plank at a 45-degree angle to the front wall. Gently place it to the ground and snap the short edges of your flooring together for the first row. Each piece should lock into the other easily. Afterwards, use a rubber mallet to gently hammer the end joints into place. Always ensure that both planks are properly aligned and at the same height. If the planks aren't locking together properly, disassemble them and check for debris inside the locking region. Measure the length of the space for the last plank. Use your measuring tape to determine the distance from the right side of the last plank to the wall. Leave a \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) gap for spacers.

If the leftover piece is too short, cut a new plank into 2 pieces to create a piece that's an appropriate size. Always make sure that your planks are at least 12 inches (30 cm) long. The end joints (vertical crack between each attached plank) of every row should be 8 inches (20 cm) or more horizontally apart from adjoining rows.

If they're not, disassemble them and check for dirt or particles lodged in the locking regions. Tap scrap planks gently into previous rows using a vertical hammering motion. After placing your rows down, place a scrap plank against the bottom side of the row and use a mallet to hammer them upward using a vertical motion. This procedure helps you ensure that each row is tightly attached and there are no gaps between any of the planks. Be sure to do this after each row is complete\u2014gaps can compromise the entire installation. Place \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) spacers on the front wall after 2 to 3 rows. You should now have \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) spacers between your planks and the left, right, and front walls. These gaps are important to give yourself enough space to properly install molding following installation. Use this time to make sure that all of your end joints are at least 8 inches (20 cm) apart. Position a loose plank on top of the previous row when laying the final row. Afterwards, place another board on top, making sure that the tongue side faces the wall. If you're unsure which is the tongue side, look for the side that has a piece extending outward from the middle of the board that fits into the groove of the next piece. Draw a line along the edge of the loose plank on top of the previous row. Afterwards, cut along the line to mark the first plank. Then, go over the line again with your knife, this time cutting deep enough that you can pull the bottom off. The plank should now be the proper size for the final row. Continue cutting boards in this manner to create planks for the final row. Place your pre-cut planks into the final row. Always make sure they are at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) wide. If you measured your room properly, this shouldn't be a problem. If you find that your planks must be less than 2 inches (5.1 cm) wide, cut down the planks in your first row to accommodate them. Remove the spacers before you place each plank into the final row.",

        "This plank acts as the first piece of your second row.",
        "The small plank should be at least 12 inches (30 cm) long.",
        "If the leftover piece is too short, cut a new plank into 2 pieces to create a piece that's an appropriate size.",
        "Always make sure that your planks are at least 12 inches (30 cm) long.",
        "The end joints (vertical crack between each attached plank) of every row should be 8 inches (20 cm) or more horizontally apart from adjoining rows.",
        "Attach the long side of second row planks into the first row.",
        "Make sure that they are tight into the short end of each previous plank at an angle of 30 degrees.",
        "Drop each plank down from this angle and gently tap the tows together with your mallet to eliminate any gaps between long sides.",
        "Always make sure your planks are perfectly aligned.",
        "If they're not, disassemble them and check for dirt or particles lodged in the locking regions.",
        "Tap scrap planks gently into previous rows using a vertical hammering motion.",
        "After placing your rows down, place a scrap plank against the bottom side of the row and use a mallet to hammer them upward using a vertical motion.",
        "This procedure helps you ensure that each row is tightly attached and there are no gaps between any of the planks.",
        "Be sure to do this after each row is complete\u2014gaps can compromise the entire installation.",
        "Place \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) spacers on the front wall after 2 to 3 rows.",
        "You should now have \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) spacers between your planks and the left, right, and front walls.",
        "These gaps are important to give yourself enough space to properly install molding following installation.",
        "Use this time to make sure that all of your end joints are at least 8 inches (20 cm) apart.",
        "Position a loose plank on top of the previous row when laying the final row.",
        "Afterwards, place another board on top, making sure that the tongue side faces the wall.",
        "If you're unsure which is the tongue side, look for the side that has a piece extending outward from the middle of the board that fits into the groove of the next piece.",
        "Draw a line along the edge of the loose plank on top of the previous row.",
        "Afterwards, cut along the line to mark the first plank.",
        "Then, go over the line again with your knife, this time cutting deep enough that you can pull the bottom off.",
        "The plank should now be the proper size for the final row.",
        "Continue cutting boards in this manner to create planks for the final row.",
        "Place your pre-cut planks into the final row.",
        "Always make sure they are at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) wide.",
        "If you measured your room properly, this shouldn't be a problem.",
        "If you find that your planks must be less than 2 inches (5.1 cm) wide, cut down the planks in your first row to accommodate them.",
        "Remove the spacers before you place each plank into the final row."
