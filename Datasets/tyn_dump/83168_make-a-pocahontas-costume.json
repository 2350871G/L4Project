Anything that is earthy and doesn't scream factory-made will do the job. Two-piece with Poncho Buy two lengths of faux-suede material. Pick any shade of brown you like. If you don't know how much to buy, consult an expert at the fabric store. An average sized female will need around 2 yards (1.8 m). Fold one piece of your material in half.
