Have another person (or 2) help you pick up the grand piano and tilt it towards its long, flat side. Set this side gently on top of the piano board. Never let the weight of the piano rest on the legs, as they can easily snap off. Do this very carefully, so as not to drop or damage any part of the piano. The movement should be controlled and guided at all times. A piano board is a large, flat wooden surface build to hold the side of a piano. Piano boards typically have handles to which you can strap the body of the piano. You can purchase a piano board at a local moving-supply store.
