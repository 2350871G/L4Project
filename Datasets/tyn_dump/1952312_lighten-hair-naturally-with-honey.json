Mix four parts honey and one part water or apple cider vinegar (which acts as a conditioner) in a bowl until thoroughly combined. If you want a more drastic change, you can add a few capfuls of hydrogen peroxide to the mixture. This reacts with your hair to bleach it several shades lighter. Don't use peroxide if your hair is black or very dark brown, or it may come out orange. For a reddish-blonde hue, add some henna powder, cinnamon or ground coffee to the mixture. Adding hibiscus petals will add a strawberry blonde hue."
