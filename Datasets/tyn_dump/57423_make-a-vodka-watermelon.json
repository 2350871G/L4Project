                    "description": "A day or 2 before your party, pick up a whole, seedless watermelon and a bottle of vodka with a slender neck. Set the watermelon on a serving tray or in a bowl so that it sits completely still. Open the bottle and use the cap to trace a circle onto the top side of the watermelon using a pen. It\u2019s important to make sure your watermelon sits still without rolling over. If it\u2019s not stable, you\u2019ll end up with a sloshy, pink mess in your refrigerator! Cut a thin slice from the rind at the base of the watermelon, if necessary, so that it doesn\u2019t rock back and forth or spin around. But just don\u2019t cut deep into the edible flesh or else the watermelon might leak. It may take between 12 and 24 hours to fully infuse the watermelon, so be sure to plan ahead."
