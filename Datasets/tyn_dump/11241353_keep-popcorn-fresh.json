Reviving Stale Popcorn Preheat the oven to 250 \u00b0F (121 \u00b0C) and spread the popcorn on a sheet. Get out a rimmed baking sheet so the popcorn won't slide off it. Then, put as much stale popcorn as you like on it.Tip: If you need to revive a lot of stale popcorn, reheat it in batches. Arrange the popcorn so it's in a single layer. Heat the popcorn for 5 minutes. Put the baking sheet into the preheated oven and leave it so it crisps up. You can check the popcorn after 5 minutes to see if it's not soggy or chewy anymore.

If your popcorn is plain, toss it with melted butter and salt or your choice of seasonings. You could sprinkle cheesy powder, curry powder, or cinnamon sugar, for example. Avoid storing the popcorn once you season it since they'll make the popcorn become soggy again. Making Plain Stovetop Popcorn Pour the oil into a heavy pan and add 2 popcorn kernels. Place the heavy pan on the stove and pour 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of canola or vegetable oil into it. Put 2 of the popcorn kernels into the pan and put the lid on. If you use a pan with a glass lid, you'll be able to see when the kernels pop. If you don't have a glass lid, you'll need to listen for the kernels to pop. Turn the burner to medium-high and wait for a kernel to pop. You'll know the oil is hot enough when you see or hear at least 1 of the kernels pop. Avoid frequently lifting the lid to check the kernels because heat will escape from the pan. Add 1/2 cup (105 g) of popcorn kernels and put the lid back on the pan. Carefully lift the lid and add the kernels. Then, swirl the pan gently so the kernels are coated in the oil and put the lid back on.Tip: If you'd like to make more popcorn, cook the popcorn in batches instead of adding more kernels to the pan. Shake the pan over the burner for 2 to 4 minutes so all of the kernels pop. Swirl the pan gently to keep the kernels moving so they don't burn. You'll hear the kernels begin to pop within 1 to 2 minutes. Then, it will take another 1 to 2 minutes for all of the kernels to pop. Remove the pan when you hear 3 seconds between each pop. You shouldn't hear very many kernels sliding around the pan if you give it a gentle shake. The popping should also slow down once most of the kernels have popped. Turn off the burner when you hear 1 pop about every 3 seconds. Look out for pieces of popcorn that might pop out of the pan as you remove it.",
