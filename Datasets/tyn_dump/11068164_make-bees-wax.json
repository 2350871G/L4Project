If you have some honeycombs that are already quite clean, then keep those separate from the dirty ones. You can render them separately and this will reduce the amount of filtering that you need to do for the clean batch. Dirty honeycombs will look brown or even black, while clean honeycombs are light yellow in color.Safety Precaution: Be extremely careful when scraping out old frames. Make sure that there are no bees present and that you wear protective gear to collect the frames. If you are not an experienced beekeeper, then ask someone who is to collect the frames for you."
