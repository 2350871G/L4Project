Broiled Blood Sausage with Greens Preheat the broiler to HIGH and move a rack to the top. Place the top rack so it's about 3 to 4 in (7.5 to 10 cm) below the heating element.

Use a rimmed baking sheet to prevent the sausages from sliding off as you move the sheet. Broil the sausages for 1 to 2 minutes. Put the sheet on the rack under the broiler and heat the sausages until they're browned on top. Watch the sausages as they broil to prevent them from burning.
