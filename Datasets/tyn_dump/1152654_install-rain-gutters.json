If the gutter is shorter than this length, it will slope down to the left or right toward a single gutter. Whether you obtain your measurements from a ladder or the top of the roof, exercise caution: do not lean without support, place a ladder on uneven ground, or wear shoes without adequate traction. Purchase at least the total length of gutter along with additional materials. Head to a home improvement store for gutter material, fascia brackets, and downspout(s). A fascia bracket must be attached to every other rafter tail, which is approximately every 32 inches (81.3 cm).
