Fold the square horizontally downwards.  Fold the paper (now a rectangle) vertically to the right.  Unfold. Then flip to the other side and do a fold in which the horizontal creases fold down to the vertical crease. Push the remaining loop of paper down to form a triangle. From the right side take one layer and fold it so that the edge touches the crease in the middle. Repeat on the left side. Flip over the paper and repeat step 7.  Flip the paper so that the larger point is at the top.  On the right side of the shape you have made, tuck one of the triangles under the other. Then, in the gap between the layers of the triangle, tuck in the other triangle and push it so that it will stay down. Repeat on the other side. The flower is now created. This step can be a little tricky, so do it carefully. Cut off the smaller end (only slightly) of the flower creation to create a small hole.  Making the twisted stem Retrieve the small rectangle.  Fold it in half horizontally two times.  Twist it around and around until it starts to bend (by itself). This creates the stalk, which will shortly be inserted into the hole made at the end of the previous section.
