                    "description": "No matter what the occasion, you'll want your dog to be clean and well-groomed. You can achieve this at home with just a few steps. First, brush out your dog's coat, paying special attention to any places that are matted together. To brush out mats, hold your dog's fur close to the skin and gently work out the mat with your brush starting at the end farthest from your dog's body and working your way up. Cut out especially difficult mats with a pair of scissors. Choose a brush (or multiple brushes) based on your dog's specific needs. For example, dogs with short, smooth coats, like Chihuahuas or boxers, need a rubber brush to remove dead skin and a bristle brush to get rid of dead hair. However, a Yorkshire terrier, which has a long, luxurious coat, needs a slicker brush to remove mats and a bristle brush to brush through their hair once the mats are gone. If you have a dog with a double-coat, like a Husky or a Pomeranian, you will also need a rake in addition to a slicker to remove loose fur from the undercoat."

                    "description": "Generally, dogs only need to be bathed once every few months, so plan accordingly when you know you have a special occasion coming up. When bathing your dog, begin by spraying their coat all over with lukewarm water. Add a dollop of shampoo to your hand and, starting at your dog's head or neck, work your way down their body, gently massaging the shampoo in as you go. Rinse your dog thoroughly, making sure you get all the shampoo out of their coat. Only use shampoos formulated specifically for dogs. Human shampoos can cause dogs to suffer from dry, flaky, irritated skin and can leave them at risk for developing a subsequent infection. Remove your dog's collar before bathing and spend extra time on their neck. It is especially important to keep the area around their collar clean. Take special care to keep shampoo from getting into your dog's eyes and nose when you're washing around their face. Placing a drop of mineral oil around each eye can help keep shampoo out. Also, place a cotton ball in each ear to keep water from getting in them."

If you want them to dry faster, you can also use a hairdryer (on the cool setting) to finish drying their fur.

Cut the tip of each nail off at a slight angle right before the point where the nail starts to curve under. Be extra careful to avoid cutting the quick, or the pink vein that runs into your dog's nails. The quick can be hard to see under your dog's nails, especially if they are black, so spend some time trying to figure out where it is before you begin trimming. While you are cutting your dog's nails, also check for dirt and debris between their toes. In addition, check the pads of their feet for any cuts or foreign objects. If you do accidentally cut the quick, it will begin to bleed. Use styptic powder, available at most pet stores, to help stop the bleeding."
