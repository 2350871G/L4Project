Turn the dial so that the aperture priority setting is selected. The aperture setting is identified by an \u201cA\u201d and sometimes an \u201cAv\u201d on certain Canon models. Aperture is the size of the hole in the lens through which light travels, similar to the pupil of an eye. Aperture is measured in f-numbers (Ex: f/1.4), known as \u201cf-stops\u201d. And while it may sound confusing, the larger the f-stop, the smaller the f-stop. So a f/1.4 will have a larger aperture (hole) than a f/2. A smaller f-stop will create a larger depth of field and be able to separate the foreground and background better, blurring the background."

                    "description": "To better blur the background of your photograph you want to create enough distance between the camera and the subject so that you can zoom on your camera to better focus it on your foreground. In addition, the further your subject is from the background, the easier it will be to get a nice blurred look. Depending on your lens, play with this distance having your subject stand 5, 10, or 15 feet away from the background."
