Use the gearshift on your right handle to shift to the lowest gear available, which will loosen the chain. Unlock your rear brake by pulling down on the metal bracket that holds the brake cable in place. On some bikes, you can disengage the rear brake by twisting a lever on the side of the brake. You can also unscrew the brake pad itself by loosening the nut on top of the pad with an Allen wrench as well."

A little oil or grease is healthy for these pieces anyway, since you don\u2019t want the cogs to rub against one another without being lubricated. The cassette is an especially strong part of your bike. It experiences a lot of friction and movement from the chain every time that you ride, so you don\u2019t need to use a microfiber cloth or anything like that. The cassette is kind of difficult to remove and reassemble. It\u2019s a lot easier to clean it without removing it from the wheel."

Since the cogs don\u2019t rotate counterclockwise, you can only rotate them in one direction. The cassette will rotate while you do this. The cassette rotates clockwise towards the front of the bike when pressure is applied in this direction. This is how your chain generates torque when you pedal your bike."

        "Continue sliding the cloth back and forth between the 2 cogs.",
        "Drag the fabric to the right and pull it back to the left.",
        "Every time that you move the cloth to the right, the cassette will rotate.",
        "This will allow you to clean every portion of the cogs.",
        "Do this 5-10 times to rotate the cassette a total of 3-4 times and clean each portion of the cogs.",
        "You can do this as fast or slow as you\u2019re comfortable with.",
        "If you have a pretty good grip on the movement and you can get into a solid rhythm, feel free to move the cloth quickly.",
        "You\u2019ll still get the cogs clean if you take your time, though.",
        "Repeat this process on each cog to remove all of the debris.",
        "After you\u2019ve cleaned in between the first 2 cogs on the cassette, pull your cloth out and slide it in between the second and third cogs in the assembly.",
        "Clean these cogs the same exact way that you cleaned the first set of cogs.",
        "Do this for every set of cogs to clean out the gunk in between the individual components of the cassette.",
        "On the last and biggest cog, pull the cloth out away from the wheel as you slide it back and forth.",
        "There isn\u2019t a surface behind the last cog for you to slide the cloth against, so you need to rely on outward force to turn the cassette.",
        "Deep-Cleaning with a Pipe Cleaner Swap your cloth out for a pipe cleaner to get deep into the cassette.",
        "Set the cloth aside and grab a pack of pipe cleaners.",
        "The standard pipe cleaners that you use for arts and crafts are perfect for this.",
        "While the cloth works to wipe down the flatter sections of the individual cogs, it doesn\u2019t do a great job cleaning the hard-to-reach areas where the axle meets each individual piece.",
        "A pipe cleaner is perfect for these areas, though.",
        "You can use a shoelace instead if you don\u2019t have pipe cleaners.",
        "Scrub in between the cogs the same way you used the cloth.",
        "Hold the pipe cleaner by both ends and slide it in between the first and second cogs from underneath.",
        "Drag the pipe cleaner back and forth like you\u2019re flossing.",
        "Do this 5-10 times before moving on to the second set of cogs.",
        "Continue cleaning in between the cogs while pulling the pipe cleaner up a little to clean the area around the axle out.",
        "The pipe cleaner will get much deeper than the cloth, so don\u2019t be surprised if a lot more gunk falls out of the cassette.",
        "Don\u2019t worry\u2014this isn\u2019t a sign that you did the first part incorrectly!",
        "Swap your pipe cleaner out for a fresh one whenever it gets extremely filthy.",
        "Slide your pipe cleaner in between a groove on the outside of the first cog.",
        "The exterior rim of each circular cog is filled with small grooves.",
        "Grab a fresh pipe cleaner and hold it by both ends.",
        "Starting on your first cog, either bend the pipe cleaner outwards a little to rest it on top of a grove, or slide the fresh pipe cleaner on top of the groove and pull it to the side to hold it in place.",
        "These grooves latch on to the chain and generate traction when you pedal.",
        "Drag the pipe cleaner back and forth to scrub the groove.",
        "Simply move the pipe cleaner back and forth 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) at a time to gently clean the groove.",
        "It\u2019s good to have a little oil on these grooves, so you don\u2019t need to scrub especially hard to clean them out.",
        "Drag the pipe cleaner over the groove 4-5 times to gently remove any gunk or buildup.",
        "Repeat this process on all of the other grooves on your cogs.",
        "Use this same process to clean out all of the grooves on the front cog.",
        "Then, repeat the process on your second cog.",
        "Continue doing this until you\u2019ve cleaned out all of the grooves on the cassette.",
        "Depending on the number of grooves that you have, this part of the cleaning process can easily take 20-30 minutes.",
        "This isn\u2019t particularly hard to do, but each cog can have 5-15 grooves.",
        "Cleaner grooves will grip the chain more effectively than dirty grooves.",
        "This will reduce the likelihood that you slip a chain in the future.",
        "Clean your chain to keep the cassette from getting dirty in the future.",
        "Spray your chain with a degreaser and wipe it down thoroughly with a microfiber cloth.",
        "Use an Allen wrench to tighten the individual links in the bicycle chain.",
        "Then, re-lubricate your bike using a bike chain oil.",
        "Pour a few drops of your oil into a cloth and rub the cloth into your chain.Tip: Cleaning your chain once every 1-2 months will dramatically increase the lifespan of your cassette.",
        "If you maintain your chain, you may not need to scrub cassette for 4-5 years.",
        "Reattach your rear wheel to the bike and slide the chain back on.",
        "Slide your back wheel back into the frame and rest the end of the seat bars on the axle.",
        "Wrap your chain back over the lowest gear on your bike and reattach the brake assembly.",
        "Tighten the release skewer by turning it clockwise until you can\u2019t turn it any further."
