Rub the balloon against the hair on top of your head. Gently move the balloon back and forth several times along your scalp. This will allow the static charge of the balloon to be transferred all over your hairs, which will help them stand up. Look in the mirror. At this point, your hair should be standing up! The static electricity effects won\u2019t last longer than a minute or so, but you can maintain your static hairdo by continuing to rub your hair with the balloon.
