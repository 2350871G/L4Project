You don't want to transfer any bacteria to your clean potatoes. Wash the potatoes just before you plan to cook and eat them. Do not wash the potatoes before storing them, as this could lead to early rot and spoilage. Rinse the potato with cool water.All potatoes should be washed, including organic ones, and ones you plan on peeling. Organic potatoes may be free of chemicals and pesticides, but they will still be covered with dirt and bacteria. You also want to wash potatoes that you plan on peeling. If you don't wash them first, you might end up dragging some of the bacteria or dirt onto the flesh when you go to peel them. Dampen the vegetable scrubber. Try to avoid using the same scrubber you use for your dishes. It may contain some soap residue, which might get onto the potato. If you don't have a vegetable scrubbing brush, find a clean sponge with a scratchy, scrubby side, and use that instead. Scrub the potato using a circular motion. Focus on any dirty areas as well as the eyes, where most of the dirt collects. Do not use any soaps, detergents, or produce cleaners. You may not end up getting all of the residue off. Also, research has proven that a simple scrubbing is pretty effective. If you notice any sprouts, pull them off. Don't leave them on the potato. Rinse the scrubber and potato.
