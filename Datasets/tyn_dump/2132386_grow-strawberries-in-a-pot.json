                    "description": "Strawberries are rarely grown from seed in home environments. Typically, you will grow strawberries from a small starter plant or from a cutting from another strawberry plant, known as a runner. Both can be easily transplanted into pots using the same methods. Runners are often cheaper than starter plants, but some may require special care, such as soaking or refrigeration. Follow the instructions from your nursery if this is the case. Day-neutral plants (which produce multiple small harvests) or everbearing plants (which produce 2 harvests a year) are ideal for growing in containers. While June-bearing plants can be grown, they will only produce 1 large harvest a year and often do better when grown in a garden."
