You can find the car model information on the wind deflector's packaging. If you're not sure what kind to buy, ask a salesperson for advice. Roll your window down. To fit the wind deflector in, you will need to roll your window at least halfway down. If your window does not roll down to the bottom, you can still fit your deflector in but may not be able to clean your window as thoroughly. Clean the window frame and channel.

Rub off any dirt, dust, or debris in the window frame so your wind deflector will fit in securely. If you are installing an adhesive wind deflector, clean off the window's trim (the painted door frame to the top and sides of the window) as well with the cleaner and dry cloth. Use a damp cloth or screwdriver to scrape dirt away from the bottom of the frame. Pull your cloth through the slot and pick out any large pieces of debris that might be stuck in the slot.

If you install the deflector while the window frame is still wet, your deflector may not attach as tightly. Give the windows time to air dry or wipe the frame and slot down with a dry towel before you prepare your wind deflector. Inserting In-Channel Deflectors Place the wind deflector into the top window channel. Lift the deflector into the top corners of the channel first and push it into place. Press up on the middle and sides of the wind deflector to keep it securely fitted into the frame. Attach any window clips, if applicable. Some wind deflectors come with clips to adhere the wind deflector's edges in place. If your wind deflector comes with any clips, push them up between the deflector and the window to fasten it in place. Your wind deflector's instructions should indicate where, specifically, to put the clips in. Check the window for obstructions.

Roll the window back up after you've finished adjusting its alignment and let it sit for at least 24 hours.

If your wind deflector seems to slow your windows down, use maintenance spray around the window channels and slot to keep it from catching on the frame while rolling up or down. You can purchase maintenance spray online or at most auto shops. Applying Adhesive Deflectors Instead Peel off a small section of the double-sided tape liner from both sides. Several inches or centimeters is enough to test the deflector's fit. Place the wind deflector along the top of the window trim to test its approximate fit. Do not remove all of the double-sided tape until you've aligned the wind deflector. Adjust the wind deflector's alignment.
