Use a T-Square aligned from the adjacent edge and align it to the pencil marks to assure perfectly square lines parallel to each other and to the mat-board edges.

Obtain a frame matching the dimensions of the finished matted print/mounting board.  Lay the cut-to-size mounting board face up and center the print on it.  Tape the print to the mounting board with archival tape \"hinges\" at the top edge only so a print \"hangs\" and expands and contracts with the humidity. Use archival tape \"hinges,\" available with instructions at any art supply store. Tape \"hinges\" are an invisible mounting method used so the upper edge of a mat only needs to overlap a print edge by 1/4 inch (.6 cm). Make a mat for the print using archival mat-board to prevent the print from touching the glass by doing the following. Measure the print horizontally and vertically. To create a mat to overlap the edges of the print by 1/4 inch (.6 cm) on each of four sides, subtract 1/2 inch (1.2 cm) from the overall horizontal and vertical dimensions of the print.

Clean both sides of the glass to be used in the frame and lay it into the fame. Assure all four edges of the glass lay securely in the frame. Lay the display side of finished, cut mat-board into the frame directly on the glass.  Lay mounted print in the frame face down on the mat-board installed previously. Before proceeding, lift an edge of the frame and look to assure the print is aligned with the mat-board opening and no dust or material is between the glass and the mat or print . With the frame face down, secure the backing material to the frame using framers points pushed into the wooden frame on each side of the frame.
