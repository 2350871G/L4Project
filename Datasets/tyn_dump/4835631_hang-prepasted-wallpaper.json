    "text": " Choosing Wallpaper Buy a plumb bob and hang it from the ceiling. Mark the vertical line in several areas on the wall. If your walls or windows appear crooked compared to these lines, consider a random wallpaper pattern so the edges and corners aren\u2019t noticeable. Ensure there is enough room to view your pattern. Generally, large prints don\u2019t work in small rooms because they make them feel smaller. Choose small prints and light colors to make your room feel larger. Small prints exaggerate the size of the room, while light colors reflect light, adding to the spacious feeling. Opt for wallpapering just one wall with any pattern to make a statement wall. It is best to use a wall without windows and other fixtures in this case. Purchase wallpaper from a wallpaper company or wall covering company if possible. This will allow you to inquire about the best methods and tips for using it. You will be able to call the store if you have any questions throughout the process. Save the run and dye lot numbers that are written on the back of your wallpaper. If you need to order more, they may be able to match the color to the exact printing that you used previously. Read the instructions that come with your wallpaper very closely. Each paper is slightly different. When in doubt, use the specific directions rather than general directions for wallpapering. Prepping the Walls and Supplies Purchase or rent a complete set of supplies according to the list of things below.  Ask if you can rent a basswood table from the wall covering shop. To make your own, rest a three by six-foot (0.9m by 1.5m) piece of three-fourths inch (1.9cm) plywood on top of two sawhorses. Sand the corners of the plywood to avoid tearing. Basswood and plywood are like a self-healing mat, allowing you to cut into the surface of the paper with a utility knife without ruining the paper. Ask someone to help you hang wallpaper for the best results. Large pieces can be slightly unwieldy. Mark the plumb line before you hang sections of wallpaper. You should make a mark every six inches (15cm) or so, to ensure you hang a sheet to be completely level. Don\u2019t trust ceilings, floors, trim or windows, since many of them are hung without being perfectly level. You will want to start hanging your wallpaper in the least conspicuous area of the room. Remove all furniture from the room, or as much furniture as you can. Cover the floor in drop cloths. The water and paste can drip off the table and onto floors. Prepare your walls in advance. You will need to apply patching compound and sand it if there are holes. Wash the wall with trisodium phosphate (TSP) or a TSP substitute. Improve the application of your wallpaper by applying a layer of acrylic undercoat, called sizing, to the wall and letting it dry overnight. For exceptionally uneven walls, you may want to apply special \u201cliner paper\u201d over them before pasting wallpaper. Wetting Prepasted Wallpaper Take a vertical strip of wallpaper. Cut it to the length of your wall, adding four inches (10cm) of extra space, or two for the top and two for the bottom. Roll the piece from bottom to top, inside out. This means the prepasted side, usually white side, should be toward the outside. Fill your water tray with room temperature water. Place it at the bottom end of your worktable. Submerge the roll of wallpaper in the water tray. Soak it for about 30 seconds, or the time recommended by the manufacturer. Roll the paper out onto your worktable. The patterned/colored side should be facing up. Fold the ends slightly inward toward the pasted side. They should not be creased, just coerced slightly in toward the pasted side. This is called \u201cbooking.\u201d Let the wallpaper sit for two to five minutes. During this time, the wallpaper expands. Laying the paper too soon will cause it to expand on the wall and create gaps. Hanging Prepasted Wallpaper Pick the wallpaper up off your worktable. Ensure the pattern is right side up. Align and apply the top half of the paper sheet to the wall. Use your plumb marks on the wall to line it up. Then, leave about two inches (5cm) of extra paper above the trim to remove later. Slide the paper into position as needed. The size on the walls should allow you to slide it to an exact position. Use a wallpaper smoothing brush or tool to remove bubbles. Brush the bubbles out toward the sides. Repeat until the wallpaper is smoothed to the wall. Repeat with the bottom half of the strip. Always smooth from top to bottom and from the center toward the sides. Wet a sponge and wash off excess paste from the patterned side of the wallpaper as needed.  Trim the wallpaper by holding a putty knife flush with the trim. Cut with one clean motion against the top edge of the putty knife using a utility knife. Keep your utility blade as horizontal as possible as you cut. Replace the blade after cutting the trim off two pieces of wallpaper. Sharp blades are essential to avoid tearing. Apply the rest of your wallpaper in a similar fashion. Make sure you align it with the plumb line and with the previous strips of wallpaper. Pay attention to manufacturer directions on how to match up the pattern. Apply the wallpaper over light switches and other features. Then, cut from the center of the fixture toward the corners. Trim the paper with our utility knife and putty knife.",
