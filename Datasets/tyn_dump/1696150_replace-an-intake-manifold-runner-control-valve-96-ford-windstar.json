There may not even be a problem with your valves (i.e. the vacuum isn't even reaching them to be able to shut them). These valves, if good, should close with very little vacuum, and should also hold the vacuum when applied with a vacuum pump. The default position (engine off, no vacuum) for these valves is open. Once the engine is started (and vacuum is being applied) these valves will close until wide open throttle, when vacuum is absent."
