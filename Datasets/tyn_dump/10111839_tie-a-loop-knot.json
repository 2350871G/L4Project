This knot is also called the non-slip knot. It's a tight knot, and it doesn't snag on weeds when fishing because the tag end of the line faces down towards the hook.

Push the end of the thread back through the loop. Keep the hook between the end of the line and the loop. Thread the end of the line back through the loop and up toward the main, longer part of the line. When choosing where to push the thread through, pick the side that's facing slightly downward toward the end of the thread. Wrap the thread around itself. Moving up the line toward the main part of the thread, take the tail end of the line and wrap it up and around the main part of the line 3-5 times. Turn the end back toward the bottom, and slip it through the loop again. This time, push it through the side of the loop that's facing slightly upward toward the rest of the thread. Tighten and adjust the loop. Pull on the end of the line slightly to tighten it and then add a little bit of water on the main part of the knot so you don't burn the line against itself.
