The answer depends on who you ask, but the bottom line is this: properly prepped, you can paint anything over anything. Prepare your surface properly by cleaning and sanding and cleaning again, then apply a primer.The key is making sure that the surface that is being primed doesn't have a gloss, as paint\u2014especially latex, will not stick to a glossy base, and  you'll have a much harder job to do in fairly short order. Read the label of the bonding primer carefully. Check to see if it will bond latex to oil."
