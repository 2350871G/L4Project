You may also remove the rind of the fruit with your fingers if you desire, but this can cause a greater amount of pulp and other fruit material to end up in the oils, which will need to be removed later. The greatest concentration of oils in most fruit is contained in the outer layer of the rind. The lighter portion of the rind contains much less oil. You can use an electric peeler to obtain the skin of the fruit, but note that this may produce more pulp than a hand peeled method."

The oil in orange peel, limonene, acts as a repellant for several types of insects. Toss a few peels into the garbage disposal and give them a good grinding to freshen up the smell of your sink."

Heavy pressure will squeeze liquid from the peel - this liquid contains the oils you're looking for. Use a fair amount of strength when pressing, but take care not to damage or break the implement you are using. You should see a small amount of oil drain from the peel after a few seconds. Cold pressing peel is quite a bit of effort for what looks to be a fairly small amount of oil. Don\u2019t get discouraged. The oil is quite potent. A garlic press is a great way of pressing small amounts of fruit peel with ease. A mortar and pestle may also be used, though this method is a little more labor intensive and difficult."

The oil will remain in its liquid form while the remainder freezes, allowing you to pour out the oil. Oil extracted this way has a small shelf life.
