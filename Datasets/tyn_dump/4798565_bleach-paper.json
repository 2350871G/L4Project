Making an Acetone Wash to Remove Ink Prepare an acetone wash in a glass casserole pan. Fill your casserole pan with acetone up to \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) deep. It should be enough acetone at the bottom of the pan to fully submerge the portion of the paper with ink. Put on a pair of rubber gloves or prepare a set of metal tongs. You'll have to hold the paper underneath the acetone wash, but doing so will harm your fingers. Either purchase a pair of rubber gloves or look for metal tongs that won't damage your paper. Hold the ink-stained paper under the acetone for 3 minutes. You only need to submerge the portion of the paper that has the ink stain, though you can submerge the entire paper if it's covered in ink. Hold it there for at least 3 minutes. Then, gently remove the paper and watch the ink disappear. Be careful when handling the wet paper. It can easily tear. Place the washed paper on a bed of paper towels. Make sure the paper towels are thick enough that the acetone won't seep through and ruin the surface beneath them.
