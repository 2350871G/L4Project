If your eyebrows and eyelashes are black or very dark brown, then black eyeliner and mascara will look natural on you. For red hair, try out auburn or brown mascaras to find one that suits you best. If your hair is blonde, taupe mascara can define your lashes while still looking natural. Use eyeliner sparingly if you have lighter hair, and consider experimenting with brown eyeliners. Pick an eyeshadow that is either close to your skin tone or a few shades lighter as your base color. For fair to medium skin tones, this means whites, taupes, and light browns. Taupes and browns are also good choices for darker skin. Just stay away from white bases when going for a natural look, as these don't blend well on darker skin. Select a second darker color for your shadow. These can be browns, taupes, and mauves. Go a little lighter than your base for a highlighter. Pick a color that is the same hue as your skin but a little lighter than your base eyeshadow."

Metallic eyeshadows like bronze and gold look wonderful with brown eyes but can ruin the illusion of a completely natural look.

For example, a slight splash of gold on the inner corners of your eyes can brighten them while still looking subtle on tan or olive skin. Matte versions of metallic colors are another more natural-looking option.

Light colors are going to highlight features by bringing them forward, and shimmer reflects light so it enhances that effect. Matte colors absorb light and push features back, so when you put a shimmer in that color, it's fighting against itself.\""

For golden skin, eyeshadows with subtle peach, gold, or yellow tones will work for a natural look. If your undertone is more neutral, then you likely have both rosy and golden undertones.

The easiest way to achieve this to make a very thin line across your upper lashline. For an even more subtle, natural look apply liner between each individual lash instead of drawing on a line. If your hair is dark, you can use either a minimalist technique or a slightly thicker line. A thicker line will bring more attention to your brown eyes, but a thinner one will look more natural. If both your eyes and hair are very dark, you can try a subtle winged or \"cat eye\" eyeliner in addition to any of the above methods. At the outer corner of your eye, continue your eyeliner slightly at an upward angle pointing to the end of your eyebrow. Match the thickness of this line to the rest of your eyeliner.
