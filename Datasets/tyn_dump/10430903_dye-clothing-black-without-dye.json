        "If you\u2019re washing it by hand, you\u2019ll know all the dye has been removed when the water runs clear and is no longer colored.",
        "Wash the fabric separately if you're using a washing machine so you don't stain other clothes.",
        "Using Iris Roots to Dye Fabric Place 1 part vinegar and 4 parts water along with your fabric in a pot.",
        "This mixture will act as a color fixative to help the dye stick to the fabric.",
        "Use enough water to completely cover the fabric.",
        "For example, for every 1 cup (240 ml) of vinegar, you\u2019ll need 4 cups (950 ml) of water.",
        "White vinegar works best for dyeing.",
        "Light-colored, natural fabric like pale silk or white muslin absorb dye the best.",
        "Avoid dyeing dark or synthetic fabric.",
        "Simmer the mixture for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.",
        "Turn the stove on low heat, bringing the water and vinegar solution to a light simmer.",
        "Use a spoon to move the fabric around in the pot so the liquid seeps into every spot.",
        "Vinegar has a slightly higher boiling point than water so it will take longer to heat up.",
        "Remove the fabric from the pot and rinse it in cold water.",
        "After letting it simmer for 1 hour, you're now ready to dye the fabric.",
        "Run it under cool water in the sink for 1 to 2 minutes, just to remove some of the vinegar.",
        "You can also dip the fabric into a basin filled with cold water to rinse it.",
        "Don't worry about the strong vinegar odor.",
        "That will be removed when you wash the fabric after dyeing it.",
        "Combine 1 part iris roots with 2 parts water in a separate pot.",
        "Again, you\u2019ll want enough water in the pot to cover the fabric.",
        "If you use 2 cups (470 ml) of iris roots, for example, pour in 4 cups (950 ml) of water.",
        "Dye can be poisonous so pick a pot that you won\u2019t use for cooking again.",
        "Buy iris roots from a plant nursery or an online retailer.",
        "You can soak the roots whole or chop them into smaller pieces to fit in your pot.",
        "Place the wet fabric in the dye and let it simmer for 1 hour.",
        "Over low heat, bring the dye bath to just below boiling.",
        "Stir the fabric every so often, making sure it\u2019s totally submerged and gets evenly coated in dye.",
        "The bottom of the pot is the hottest so the dye is more intense there.",
        "As you stir, flip the fabric over so one area doesn\u2019t get darker than the others.",
        "If you want to use your hands to mix the fabric in the dye, wear rubber gloves to protect them.",
        "Let the fabric soak in the dye overnight if you want a darker color.",
        "The longer the fabric sits in the dye bath, the darker black it will be.",
        "This will likely be necessary if you\u2019re using synthetic fabrics which don\u2019t absorb dye as readily.",
        "Keep in mind that the color will get lighter once the fabric dries.",
        "Cover your pot with a lid or place it out of reach of children and pets while it sits overnight since dye can be poisonous.",
        "Wash the fabric with cold water and detergent, then let it dry.",
        "Look at the tag on the clothing to see if your item can be machine-washed or tumble-dried.",
        "If there\u2019s no tag, err on the side of caution and hand wash your fabric using cool water and a mild soap.",
        "Then toss it in the dryer or hang it up outside.Washing tip: Don\u2019t wash newly dyed fabric with other clothes as the dye can spread and stain the other pieces."
