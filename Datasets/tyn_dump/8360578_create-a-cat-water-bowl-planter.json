You can use a small dish from the cat section of a pet store, or you can use another small glass or ceramic dish instead. Choose a low bowl or planter to use as a base. It needs to be wider than your cat's water dish and a little bit taller. It also needs to be tall enough that your cat can still reach into it while drinking water. Keep in mind that most cats like to crouch low to the ground while drinking water. It is highly recommended that you use a planter with a drainage hole at the bottom.
