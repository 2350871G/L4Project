An autoclave is a process that uses superheated steam and high pressures to sterilize laboratory equipment. Wash the vials with a gentle cleanser and water, then sterilize in the autoclave for 20 minutes at 121 \u00b0C (250 \u00b0F). If you don\u2019t have access to an autoclave, you can wash the vials in a 10% bleach solution. Rinse well after washing. This step is important to remove any sort of contaminant that could affect your colony of flies."
