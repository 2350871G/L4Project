Look at the top bar of your blinds to see how much space there is between the ends and the mounting hardware. If you only need to make a minor adjustment, you can cut one side of the blinds, but if you need to remove more than 4\u20135 inches (10\u201313 cm), then cut a little bit off of each side. For example, if your window is 36 inches (91 cm) wide and your blinds are 40 inches (100 cm) wide, then you can either trim 4 inches (10 cm) off of one side or you can remove 2 inches (5.1 cm) off of each side. Use bamboo blinds that are only slightly larger than your window since you can only remove about 8\u201312 inches (20\u201330 cm) total. Most bamboo blinds are asymmetrical, meaning the hardware is usually closer to one end than it is to the other."
