Drill into the marks with a drill bit that\u2019s smaller than the curtain screws. Make the holes deep enough that the screws will go all the way into the wall. Make sure you don\u2019t use a drill bit that\u2019s bigger than the curtain screws or the screws will be loose in the wall. Screw the brackets into the wall with a screwdriver.

If you\u2019re using a heavy curtain rod that came with wall anchors, hammer the wall anchors into the holes before you screw the screws in. Hanging the Curtains Separate your curtain panels into pairs. A panel is just 1 single curtain. It's traditional to use 2 panels per window frame, but you can use 1 panel per frame if you prefer a simpler look. Separating the panels into pairs beforehand will make it easier to keep track of how many you're putting on the curtain rods. Slide the curtain panels onto the curtain rods.
