If you want your battery to charge effectively, they will need to be turned off. . Park a second car so that your batteries are as close as possible. In order to jumpstart your vehicle you will need another vehicle that has a good battery to give you a boost. Usually parking the cars facing each other will get the batteries closes, but sometimes it's better to park them side by side. Either way, be sure that the cars are not touching. Locate a set of jumper cables. You will need these to connect the dead battery to the good battery. Current will flow between them, allowing your engine to start and charge your dead battery. If you have a choice, longer cables can be easier to connect but transfer energy less effectively than short cables. Also, a lower gauge cable (thicker) will transfer energy faster. Locate the batteries and/or charging posts of both vehicles. The batteries will be located in a different place depending on the make and model of the vehicles. Most batteries will be found either under the hood and or in the trunk of your vehicle. Sometimes the battery is not easily accessible. If this is the case you most likely have a charging post under the hood that is connected to the battery. Jumping the Car Connect the jumper cables to the red (positive) posts. You should connect one red clip to the red post on the dead battery first. Next you should connect the other red clip to the red post of the good battery. Connect the jumper cables to the black (negative) post of the good battery. Connect one black clip to the black post on the good battery. Your cables are live now, so be careful not to touch the last metal clip to yourself or any part of your car besides unpainted metal under the hood. Connect the last black clip to a sturdy piece of metal on the car with the dead battery. This piece of metal is referred to as a ground and completes the circuit. When the circuit is completed it can cause an arc of electricity (sparking). This could damage your battery and is why you should ground the circuit away from your battery and NOT on the black battery terminal of the dead battery. Start the car with a good battery. This will start the process of charging your battery. Allow your battery to charge for a moment. You want to have enough power to turn the engine over when you hit the key. One good way to see if you have battery power is to turn on an interior light. If it burns normally then you might be able to start your car.

If it doesn't start the first time you can try two or three times, but if it still doesn't start you will need to wait and allow the battery time to charge. Cleaning Up Remove the ground. Once your car is solidly running it is time to remove the jumper cables. Start by removing the black clip attached to the metal ground. Disconnect the good battery. You should first remove the black clip from the good battery. Next you will remove the red clip from the same battery. Remove the last red clip from the bad battery. Now the cables should be completely disconnected and you can put them away. You can also close the hoods of both cars. Let the car run to charge the battery. As your motor runs it turns your alternator. This in turn charges your battery. You should allow your battery to charge up for a few minutes before hitting the road. Follow up with a mechanic to make sure that there are no underlying problems. Sometimes the cause of a dead battery is as simple as cold weather or forgetting to turn your lights off.
