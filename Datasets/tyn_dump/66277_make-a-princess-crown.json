To go with the ice theme, chose colors such as blue, turquoise, white, and silver. Here are some decorating ideas:\nTo give your crown a translucent color, use colored permanent markers to color it in. Avoid using paint pens, as those are not translucent. To give your crown a solid color, use acrylic paints and a paintbrush. You can use regular acrylic paint, metallic acrylic paint, or even glitter paint. Give your crown some sparkle with glitter. Paint your crown with Mod Podge or white glue, then shake some glitter onto it. Tap the excess glitter off. The best glitter for an ice crown would be super fine iridescent glitter. Glue tiny rhinestones or pearls along the base of the crown. You can use hot glue or superglue. Decorate the crown with rhinestones or tiny snowflake confetti/sequins. You can put a large rhinestone in the center, and use smaller ones towards the edges. You can also put some rhinestones on the points. Use hot glue or superglue for this. Consider wrapping the headband with some ribbon. This will give the hot glue something to grip on to. Place a drop of hot glue on one end of the headband, and press the end of a ribbon into it. Wrap the ribbon around the headband, like a candy cane, overlapping the edges by a little. When you get to the other side, trim off the excess ribbon, and secure the end with more hot glue. Choose a ribbon that is \u00bc to \u00bd inch (0.64 to 1/27 centimeters) thick. Try to choose a color that matches your crown. Hot glue the crown to the headband. Flip your crown over so that the back is facing you. Draw a thin line of glue along the bottom of the crown. Press the crown to the top of the headband. Make sure that the crown is centered. When you lay the headband flat on the table, the crown should be sticking straight up. Wear the crown. Even though you made the crown on a headband, you won't be wearing it like a headband. Instead, put the crown on top of your head, like a halo or tiara. Making a Lace Crown Find some lace trim. Try to get the embroidered or crocheted kind with the scalloped or zigzag edge. The fancy edge will become the fancy points of your crown. Avoid getting thin, fabric lace or ruffled lace; those are not stable enough to make princess crowns. Don't worry if the lace is not the right color. Choose the lace for the shape. You can always paint it. Cut the lace trim 8 to 12 inches (20.32 to 30.48 centimeters) long. Because lace trim is so short, it usually shorts better as a mini crown. You can try making it as a regular crown; to do this, cut the lace a little bit longer than the circumference of your head. Consider painting the lace. If your crown is not the right color, you can always paint it using acrylic paint or spray paint. Place the crown down onto a sheet of paper, then paint it. Once the paint dries, flip the crown over, and paint the other side. Most acrylic paints and spray paints will be dry to the touch in 20 minutes, but some may require up to two hours. Refer to the label for more specific drying times. If you are using acrylic paint, dab it on using paint brushes or foam brushes. Be sure to get the paint into all of the nooks and crannies. If you are using spray paint, be sure to paint outside or in a well-ventilated area. Cover the crown with Mod Podge or fabric stiffener. This will help your crown keep its shape. Cover one side with Mod Podge or fabric stiffener and wait for it to dry. Then, flip the crown over, and cover the other side. Allow the Mod Podge or fabric stiffener to dry completely before moving on. Decorate the lace. You can decorate the lace crown however you want, but you might want to keep the lace's original pattern/design as a guideline. Here are some decorating ideas:\nOutline the crown with glitter. You can draw on the crown using white school glue, and then shake glitter over the glue. You can also use glitter glue instead. Attach rhinestones to the crown using hot glue or fabric glue. Glue a line of tiny rhinestones or pearls all along the bottom edge of the crown. Fold the crown into a circle and secure the ends with glue. Overlap the ends by at least \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters), or until the first point on either side are aligned. Secure them with a line of glue. You can use hot glue or fabric glue to do this. If you are using fabric glue, you might want to secure the ends with some clothespins until the glue dries. Consider gluing the crown onto a headband or a hair comb. If you made a little crown, you likely won't be able to fit it over your head. You can still wear this dainty crown if you attach it to a headband or a hair comb. Start by placing two drops of glue onto your headband or hair clip; the drops of glue need to be the same width as the crown. Press the bottom edges of the crown into the glue; try to keep its round shape as you do so. You can also loosely stitch the crown to the headband or hair comb once the glue dries. This will make it even more stable. Making a Floral Crown Measure around your head and add 2 inches (5.08). You are adding the extra length so that you can close the crown later on. Cut your wire according to your measurement. Try to find a stiffer wire that holds its shape when you form a circle with it. This will create a nice, sturdy base for your crown. Make a circle with the wire and secure the ends. Overlap the ends by 1 inch (2.54). Twist them close, or wrap florists tape around the seam. If the wire is very stiff, gently bend it into a slight oval shape so that it can fit the wearer's head better. This will be the base of your crown. Consider wrapping florists tape all around the crown base. Start at the seam, and start wrapping the tape around the wire, like a candy cane. Be sure to overlap the tape a little bit. This will make your crown sturdier. It will also make it easier to attach your flowers to the crown later on. Trim the silk flowers off of their stems. Leave a 1 to 2 inch (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) long stem at the end of each flower. You will be using this to attach the flower to your crown. It would be a good idea to use wire cutters when snipping the stems; most silk flowers have wires inside the stems. Consider saving some of the leaves as well. They can make great filler. Plan out your design. You can add as many or as few flowers as you like. Your entire crown can be covered, or just the top part. Here are some more ideas to get you started:\nArrange the largest flowers in the middle, and use smaller flowers towards the end. Alternate between large flowers, such as roses, and smaller flowers, such as baby's breath. Use either warm or cool colors for a unified look. For example, if you want a fall or summer fairy princess, you can try red/pink, orange, and yellow. If you want a winter or ice fairy princess, try green/turquoise, blue, and purple. Use contrasting colors, such as white, yellow, and sky blue. Use green florists tape to attach the first flower to the crown. Pick up your first flower, and hold it against the crown. The stem should be parallel to the wire. Wrap green florists tape around the flower and wire. Be sure to extend the tape \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) past the end of the stem. Place the next flower behind the first one and secure it with more florists tape. To create a very full crown, position the flower right over the first flower's stem. To create a thinner, more delicate crown, position the flower just behind the first flower's stem. Wrap florists tape over the stem and wire. Be sure to extend the tape \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) past the end of the stem. Keep adding flowers until there are no more flowers, or until the crown as full as you want it to be.  Choose two to four different ribbons. Try using both sheer and solid ribbons for more texture. Cut your ribbons twice as long as you want them to be; you will be folding them in half later on. Generally, about shoulder-length works well. Consider using varying lengths for a more organic effect. Smaller princesses may need shorter ribbons so that they won't get caught on anything. Slip knot the curly ribbon at the back of the wire crown. Gather all of your ribbons together. Fold them in half, all at the same time. Take the folded part (the loop) and place it against the back of your crown, right where the seam is. Take the loose ends of the ribbon, and pull them through the loop. Gently tug down on the loose ends to tighten the loop. You should now have twice as many ribbons trailing down the back of your crown. For example, if you used four ribbons, you'll end up with eight ribbon strands. Finished. ",
