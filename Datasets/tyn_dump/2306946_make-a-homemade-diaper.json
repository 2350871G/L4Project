Choose a size based on the size of your child. An older baby or toddler may need a large or extra-large shirt, but a newborn would likely only need a small. Lay the shirt flat. You can do this on the floor or on any other large working surface. Lay it so the sleeves are at the top. Fold one side of the shirt over. The bottom of the shirt should be folded over about 1/3 of the way, and the seam where the sleeve meets the body of the shirt should be just below the center of the neckline. Keep the sleeve of the shirt pointed outward. Fold the other side of the shirt over. This side should be identical to the fold made on the first side, so that the shirt is folded into thirds. Keep the sleeve pointed outwards. At this point, you should be left with a \"t\" or cross shape. Fold the top of the shirt down.
