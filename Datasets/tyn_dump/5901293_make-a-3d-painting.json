        "Consider the shadow that your object would create, and try to mimic that as closely as possible.",
        "Remember, it needs to look like there\u2019s really an object making a shadow on the paper or canvas.Think about how translucent areas, reflected light, liquids, or other objects might affect your shadow.",
        "If you\u2019re using a physical object as a model, study its actual shadow to help you get an idea of what to draw.",
        "Cut along the top of the page to make the image look like it\u2019s standing up.",
        "One of the most popular techniques to use when you\u2019re creating a 3D painting is to cut along the top of the image.",
        "To do this, choose a point somewhere near the top of the page, but below the top of the image.",
        "Use a ruler to draw a straight line on either side of the image, then cut carefully along the line and around the top of the form you drew.If you don\u2019t want to do this, you may want to draw some sort of a background onto the canvas to help the viewer understand what they\u2019re looking at.",
        "You may want to draw a straight line to indicate a table, for instance.",
        "Stand at the photo point if you want to take a picture of your painting.",
        "Once you\u2019re finished with your painting, you may want to take a picture to show it off to your friends or post on social media.",
        "If so, lay the canvas flat on a table, then move around until you find the photo point, or the spot where the 3D point becomes apparent, then snap away!",
        "You may even want to take a video, starting from the photo point and moving forward until it becomes clear that the object is actually a 2D drawing."
