    "text": " Soaking the Bowl in Boiling Water Locate the toilet flapper and stop water flow from the tank. Remove the lid from your toilet tank and locate the toilet flapper. The flappers are typically black, blue, or red and provide the seal for the flush valve. Either close it using the chain attached or with your hands. To prevent water supply altogether, turn the handle behind the toilet near the floor in a clockwise direction. If you're having trouble turning the handle, apply an oil spray. Don't worry about contaminated water in the toilet tank\u2014germs do not enter this part of the fixture. If you're worried, wash your hands thoroughly afterward. Boil a 1 gallon (3.8 L) pot of water. Turn your stove on high heat and place a water-filled pot onto the stove. Then, cover your pot with a lid and wait for the water to boil. You can also fill the pot or bucket with hot water from the tap, but make sure it's as hot as possible\u2014the higher the temperature, the more effective it will be at fighting the clog.

If your bucket has a metal handle, hold it up with one hand and tilt the bucket with your other hand by turning it from the bottom. Wait for the water to rise to the rim after pouring the water. Adding Dish Soap Pour about 8 ounces (230 g) of dish soap into the water. The dish soap will float to the bottom of the bowl because it is heavier and denser than water. Let the soap sit for about 20 to 30 minutes. After this time, the water should lower. Always pour the water slowly and be careful not to overflow the bowl. Pour another 1 gallon (3.8 L) of boiling water into the toilet. Fill another 1 gallon (3.8 L) pot with hot water and place it onto the stove to boil. Again, hot water is also effective, but boiling water is always ideal. Turn the stove on high heat for the fastest results. Continue pouring water into the toilet and let it sit. After about 2 to 3 rounds, flush the toilet to check if the clog is gone. Be sure to give each 1 gallon (3.8 L) of boiling water about 20 minutes to settle. Wait overnight if your toilet is still not flushing properly. If it's not unclogged in the morning, try using a plunger. Plunge your toilet if it's still clogged.
