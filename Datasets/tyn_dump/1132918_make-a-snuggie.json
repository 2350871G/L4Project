If you do want to hem it, however, you'll need to use a stitch meant for stretchy fabrics, such as a narrow zigzag stitch. If you must use a straight stitch, use a longer, basting length one. Cut about 3 yards of soft, fleece fabric. Your piece should measure 60 by 108 inches (152.4 by 274.32 centimeters). A very tall person might need a longer piece of fabric. If this snuggie is for a child, start with a piece of fabric that is 2 to 2.5 yards (1.8 to 2.3 m) long. The width should stay the same: 60 inches (152.4 centimeters).

The strip should measure 24 by 60 inches (60.96 by 152.4 centimeters). If this is for a child, cut a 20 inch (50.8 centimeters) strip off the bottom. Cut the strip in half.
