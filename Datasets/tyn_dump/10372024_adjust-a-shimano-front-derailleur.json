When the derailleur cage sits too far above the chainring, this can cause the bike to shift poorly. If it is too far below, the derailleur will rub against the chain rings. Fixing the height is a subtle adjustment, based on a difference of millimeters. You will need to be precise. Having your bike on a repair stand can make this work easier. You can use a penny to try and estimate if you have adjusted to the right height, as a penny is 1.5 millimetres (0.059 in) thick."
