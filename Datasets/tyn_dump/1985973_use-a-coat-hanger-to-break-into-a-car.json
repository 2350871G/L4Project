        "Once the tip of the hanger is inside the cabin of the car, you may not be able to see the slide for the door lock from your position.",
        "Ask a friend to stand on the passenger side of the car and guide you by looking through the window.",
        "You can still find the lock without a second pair of eyes, but enlisting some help will make the process far easier.",
        "Be patient and continue trying until you are able to snag or press the slide.",
        "Press or pull on the slide to unlock the door.",
        "Once you get the hanger on the slide, push or pull it as necessary to unlock the door.",
        "This may take a number of tries and you also may need to make changes to the bends in the coat hanger in order to get to the slide from the right angle.",
        "Be patient and continue trying until you are able to snag or press the slide.",
        "Be careful not to do further damage to the weather proofing as you move the hanger around.",
        "Making a Slim Jim from a Coat Hanger Straighten the hanger except for a short hook at the end.",
        "Just as with other methods, you will need to unfold the hanger and straighten it, except for the end.",
        "Use a pair of pliers to form a short hook at the end of the hanger.",
        "Leave only a half inch or so as the lip of the hook, while leaving the rest of the hanger straight.",
        "You may need to bend the hook a few times in order to get it right.",
        "Make sure the rest of the hanger is a fairly straight line.",
        "Slip the hanger between the window and the weather stripping.",
        "There should be a length of black rubber weather stripping running along the lower edge of your car window.",
        "Peel this strip back from the window a bit using your finger, then gently insert the curved end of the coat hanger into the gap between the window and the rubber.",
        "You should be able to lower the coat hanger into this gap a few inches without encountering much resistance.",
        "You may have to replace the weather stripping if you damage it during this process.",
        "It may be easier to insert the hanger with the hook facing the front or rear of the vehicle.",
        "Turn the hanger so the hook is facing the interior.",
        "With the hanger and hook inserted in the door, rotate it until you believe the hook is facing the inside of the car so it can catch the lock bar inside the door.",
        "It may be difficult to determine which way the hook is facing inside the door; you can mark one side of the hanger with a marker to make it easier to keep your bearings.",
        "The hook will need to face inward in order to grip the lock bar.",
        "You may need to try a number of times in order to get this method right.",
        "Move the hanger side to side until you see the lock move.",
        "As you move the hanger back and forth, it will come into contact with a bar or pin that controls the lock post and door lock.",
        "Try to pull up on the pin or bar to disengage the door lock.",
        "It will usually be located about 2 inches (5 cm) below the bottom of the window, near the interior door handle.",
        "Different vehicles may have different interior door designs, so this method may not work on all vehicles.",
        "Do not use excessive force when pulling up on the pin or bar.",
        "Because you can\u2019t see inside the door, you may be snagged on the wrong thing.",
        "In some vehicles you will need to pull the pin or bar back toward the rear of the car instead of up.",
        "Pull up or back on the area that moves the lock.",
        "If you see the lock move slightly when your hook catches a bar or pin inside the door, try to pull up or backward on the bar you\u2019ve come into contact with to disengage the lock.",
        "If you catch the bar properly, it should not take too much force to move the lock.",
        "Pulling up and toward the rear of the car can help ensure you have leverage on the bar or pin as well as improving the odds that you get it right for your specific vehicle.",
        "Keep trying and reform the hook as needed.",
        "This method is extremely difficult, as you can\u2019t actually see what is going on inside the door and vehicles each have slightly different designs.",
        "You will need to continue to try until you are able to catch the bar in just the right manner and pull it with enough force to unlock the door.",
        "Be careful not to damage the weather strip on the door.",
        "You may need to re-bend the hook if you pull too hard on the wrong part inside the door."
