For example, think about if you'd like to attach roses to a scarf, jacket, blanket, or hat. You'll need to decide how large you'd like your roses and how many you intend to make. Select your yarn. A worsted weight yarn is ideal for starting, since you'll be able to see the stitches. Consider how you'll be using the roses. If they're embellishing a scarf or purse, you may want a specialty yarn. Make sure the texture of the yarn matches the texture of the item you'll be attaching it to. Pick your crochet hook. This is basically determined by the type of yarn you've chosen.

The hook size suggestion doesn't have to be followed, but your crocheting might turn out knotty or too loose. Crocheting Your Roses Create a slipknot. Make a loop about 6 inches (15.2 cm) from the free end of the yarn. The free end should hang behind your loop. Insert your crochet hook through the loop and hook the free end before pulling it back through the loop and onto the hook. Chain 60 stitches.

Double crochet all across your foundation chain. Make sure to insert your hook into the chain and not the gap closer to your hook. To double crochet into your chain, insert your hook and yarn over. Pull up a loop, yarn over, pull through two, yarn over and pull through two. Continue doing this across the length of the chain. Count your stitches. Check to make sure you have 60 stitches once you complete the row. Turn your work. Turning your work simply means rotating it so that the last stitch you worked becomes the beginning of the next row. Create a scallop: skip one stitch and double crochet 6 times into the next stitch. Repeat this all the way across. To double crochet, yarn over insert your hook under both of your loops, yarn over, and pull up. You should now have three loops on your hook. Yarn over, pull through two, yarn over and pull through two. Secure the scallop: skip one stitch and single crochet into the next stitch. Repeat this all the way across.

Wrapping the scalloped piece tightly will create a smaller ruffled rose, as compared to one that's looser and larger. Play with wrapping until you create a shape you like.

Pull through to tighten the end of your scalloped piece. Work your thread through the base. Using your threaded needle, continue working back and forth through the bottom or base of the row. Make sure to pass through all of the rose's layers. Keep working the thread back and forth until the rose feels secure. Tightly tie off the loose ends. Trim the remaining thread and use your rose.",
