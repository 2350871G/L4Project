Remove the stem from the top of the tomato.  Set the tomato on a cutting board, with the top section facing up. If you are coring a tomato that has a pointy tip, you can tilt it to one side and core it at an angle. Insert a very sharp paring knife into the top of the tomato. Insert the knife tip at an angle of approximately 25 degrees from a vertical axis. Push the knife down approximately \u00bd to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) at this angle. Stop inserting the knife when you think the tip of your knife is at the center point of your tomato. Hold the tomato firmly and cut in a circular motion while turning the fruit. When you reach your starting point, you can pick up the tomato core and dispose of it. Coring and Seeding Tomatoes Place your washed tomato on a cutting board. Place it stem side up. Slice the tomato in half vertically from the top. Hold the tomato together with your other hand and slice it into fourths. Let the 4 tomato slices open onto the cutting board.  Use your knife to slice from the top of the tomato toward the bottom. Cut the white core away from the sides of the tomato. The knife blade should scrape lightly against the inside wall of the tomato. Repeat with the 3 remaining sections. Discard the seeds and white core. Slice the cored tomato or cut it into smaller pieces.",
