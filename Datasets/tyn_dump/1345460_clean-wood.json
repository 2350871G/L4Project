You may also want to mop it with warm water and a little bit of a water-based cleaner. Remove loose surface dirt and dust with a clean, soft cotton cloth in specific areas, like under furniture. Suck up dust or surface dirt with a vacuum cleaner, using the hose and soft brush attachments. Cleaners that have a neutral PH balance won\u2019t disturb the finish of your floor. Cleaners like detergents can remove dust and dirt, but have a higher PH balance. Only use these on older floors."

If your stains are surface level, you probably have a hard urethane finish. However, if the stain goes deeper into the wood, you may have a soft oiled finish. For hard finishes, only use a soft, clean cloth to wipe. Harder brushes, harsh chemicals with a higher PH balance, or steel wool can ruin your coating. For soft finishes, you can use No. 000 steel wool and wood floor wax. If the area doesn\u2019t lighten up, apply vinegar to warm water and soak the area for about an hour. Then rinse with a clean damp cloth. As a general rule for soft finishes, use steel wool and floor wax for tougher marks, and a light cloth with dishwashing detergent and water for lighter, or oil-based stains."
