If you think your structure may need waterproofing, get a general contractor you trust to give you advice.

Sheet membranes boast even thickness, but are more expensive (in both parts and labor) than liquid membranes, and can take some time getting used to. Self-adhering sheet membranes are extremely sticky. You need to be very diligent about peeling the membrane to expose the sticky side, because it will stick to anything it comes in contact with, and it's virtually impossible to un-stick it once it is laid. Be sure to pay special attention to how sheet membranes overlap, as improper installation can result in the possibility for leakage. Make sure that lap joints are properly cut and that a bead of mastic is run down every lap joint that's spaced within one foot of a corner. Sheet membranes need at least two people to install. Installing them by yourself is a sure recipe for a poor job and create a lot of needless frustration for yourself."
