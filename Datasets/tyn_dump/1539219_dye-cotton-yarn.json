                    "description": "White will be the best, because it will give you the brightest results. If you want a more dusty, muted color, however, you could try gray instead. Most importantly, make sure that the yarn is made from 100% cotton. Most fabric, yarn, and craft stores will have a special section in their yarn aisle for cotton yarn. Some cotton yarn is mercerized and has a shiny finish. You can still dye this type of yarn, but be aware that it may take the dye differently from other types of cotton yarn. Do not get yarn made from mixed materials, such as 50% cotton and 50% acrylic, or it may not dye evenly."

Keep wrapping the yarn until you have used up the entire ball. Wrap the yarn tight enough so that it doesn't slide off, but loose enough so that it doesn't stretch or feel uncomfortable. Do not dye your yarn while it is still in a ball, or it won't dye evenly. If your yarn came twisted like a rope, simply untwist the \"rope\" until you have a loop of yarn instead."
