Single tubed stethoscopes are better than double tubed ones. The tubes in double tubed stethoscopes can rub together. This noise can make it hard to hear heart sounds. Thick, short, and relatively stiff tubing is best, unless you plan to wear the stethoscope around your neck. In that case, a longer tube is best. Make sure that tubing is free of leaks by tapping on the diaphragm (the flat side of the chest piece). As you tap, use the earpieces to listen for sounds.

Many patients who have asthma also have wheezes, and sometimes you can even hear the wheezing without a stethoscope. Stridor sounds like high-pitched musical breathing, similar to wheezing, heard most often when the patient inhales. Stridor is caused by a blockage in the back of the throat. This sound can also often be heard without a stethoscope. Rhonchi sounds like snoring. Rhonchi cannot be heard without a stethoscope and happens because the air is following a \u201crough\u201d path through the lungs or because it is blocked. Rales sounds like popping bubble wrap or rattling in the lungs. Rales can be heard when a person inhales."

Although most bowel sounds are normal, some abnormalities could point to a problem. If you are unsure if the bowel sounds you hear are normal and/or the patient has other symptoms, then the patient should see a doctor for further evaluation. If you do not hear any bowel sounds, that may mean that something is blocked in the patient\u2019s stomach. It can also indicate constipation and bowel sounds may return on their own. But if they do not return, then there may be a blockage. In this case, the patient would need further evaluation by a doctor. If the patient has hyperactive bowel sounds followed by a lack of bowel sounds, that could indicate that there has been a rupture or necrosis of the bowel tissue. If the patient has very high-pitched bowel sounds, this may indicate that there is an obstruction in the patient\u2019s bowels. Slow bowel sounds may be caused by prescription drugs, spinal anesthesia, infection, trauma, abdominal surgery, or overexpansion of the bowel. Fast or hyperactive bowel sounds can be caused by Crohn\u2019s disease, a gastrointestinal bleed, food allergies, diarrhea, infection, and ulcerative colitis."

Normal breath sounds are clear, like listening to someone blowing air into a cup. Listen to a sample of healthy lungs and then compare the sounds to what you hear in your patient\u2019s lungs. There are two types of normal breath sounds:Bronchial breath sounds are those heard within the tracheobronchial tree. Vesicular breath sounds are those heard over the lung tissue. Listen for abnormal breath sounds. Abnormal breath sounds include wheezing, stridor, rhonchi, and rales. If you do not hear any breath sounds, the patient may have air or fluid around the lungs, thickness around the chest wall, or airflow that is slowed down or over inflation to the lungs. There are four types of abnormal breath sounds:\nWheezing sounds like a high pitched sound when the person exhales, and sometimes when they inhale as well. Many patients who have asthma also have wheezes, and sometimes you can even hear the wheezing without a stethoscope. Stridor sounds like high-pitched musical breathing, similar to wheezing, heard most often when the patient inhales. Stridor is caused by a blockage in the back of the throat. This sound can also often be heard without a stethoscope. Rhonchi sounds like snoring. Rhonchi cannot be heard without a stethoscope and happens because the air is following a \u201crough\u201d path through the lungs or because it is blocked. Rales sounds like popping bubble wrap or rattling in the lungs. Rales can be heard when a person inhales. Listening to Abdominal Sounds Place the diaphragm on your patient\u2019s bare stomach. Use your patient\u2019s belly button as the center and divide your listening around the belly button into four sections. Listen to the upper left, upper right, lower left and right. Listen for normal bowel sounds. Normal bowel sounds sound like when your stomach growls or grumbles. Anything else may suggest that something is wrong and that the patient requires further evaluation. You should hear \u201cgrowling\u201d in all four sections. Sometimes after surgery, bowel sounds will take a while to return. Listen for abnormal bowel sounds. Most of the sounds that you hear when listening to your patient\u2019s bowels are just the sounds of digestion. Although most bowel sounds are normal, some abnormalities could point to a problem. If you are unsure if the bowel sounds you hear are normal and/or the patient has other symptoms, then the patient should see a doctor for further evaluation. If you do not hear any bowel sounds, that may mean that something is blocked in the patient\u2019s stomach. It can also indicate constipation and bowel sounds may return on their own. But if they do not return, then there may be a blockage. In this case, the patient would need further evaluation by a doctor. If the patient has hyperactive bowel sounds followed by a lack of bowel sounds, that could indicate that there has been a rupture or necrosis of the bowel tissue. If the patient has very high-pitched bowel sounds, this may indicate that there is an obstruction in the patient\u2019s bowels. Slow bowel sounds may be caused by prescription drugs, spinal anesthesia, infection, trauma, abdominal surgery, or overexpansion of the bowel. Fast or hyperactive bowel sounds can be caused by Crohn\u2019s disease, a gastrointestinal bleed, food allergies, diarrhea, infection, and ulcerative colitis. Listening For a Bruit Determine if you need to check for a bruit. If you have detected a sound that seems like a heart murmur, you should also check for a bruit. Since heart murmurs and bruits sound similar, it is important to check for both if one is suspected. Place the diaphragm of your stethoscope over one of the carotid arteries. The carotid arteries are located in the front of your patient\u2019s neck, on either side of the Adam\u2019s apple. If you take your index and middle finger and run them down the front of your throat, you will trace over the locations of your two carotid arteries. Be careful not to press too hard on the artery or you may cut off circulation and cause your patient to faint. Never press on both carotid arteries at the same time. Listen for bruits. A bruit makes a whooshing sound that indicates that an artery is narrowed. Sometimes a bruit may be confused with a murmur because they sound similar, but if the patient has a bruit then the whooshing sound will be louder when you listen to the carotid artery than when you listen to the heart. You may also want to listen for bruits over the abdominal aorta, renal arteries, iliac arteries, and femoral arteries. Checking Blood Pressure Wrap the blood pressure cuff around your patient\u2019s arm, right above the elbow. Roll up your patient\u2019s sleeve if it is in the way. Make sure that you use a blood pressure cuff that fits your patient\u2019s arm. You should be able to wrap the cuff around your patient\u2019s arm so that it is snug, but not too tight. If the blood pressure cuff is too small or too large, get a different size. Press the diaphragm of the stethoscope over the brachial artery just below the cuff's edge. You can also use the diaphragm if you have trouble hearing with the bell. You will be listening for Korotkoff sounds, which are low tone knocking sounds that indicate the patient\u2019s systolic blood pressure. Find your pulse in your inner arm to help you determine where your brachial artery is located. Inflate the cuff to 180mmHg or 30mm above your expected systolic blood pressure. You can find the reading by looking at the sphygmomanometer, which is the gauge on the blood pressure cuff. Then, release air from the cuff at a moderate rate (3mm/sec). As you release the air, listen with the stethoscope and keep your eyes on the sphygmomanometer (gauge on the blood pressure cuff). Listen for Korotkoff sounds. The first knocking sound that you hear is your patient\u2019s systolic blood pressure. Note that number, but keep watching the sphygmomanometer. After the first sound stops, note the number that it stops on. That number is the diastolic pressure. Release and remove the cuff. Deflate and take the blood pressure cuff off of your patient right after you have gotten the second number. When you are done, you should have two numbers that make up your patient\u2019s blood pressure. Record these numbers side by side, separated by a slash. For example, 110/70. Wait a few minutes if you want to check the patient\u2019s blood pressure again. You may want to re-measure if the patient\u2019s blood pressure is high. A systolic blood pressure above 120 or a diastolic blood pressure above 80 indicates that your patient may have high blood pressure. In that case, your patient should seek further evaluation by a doctor.",
