The bottles are typically clear, with a pink or blue cap. Choose a cap that matches the gender of your baby: pink for girls or blue for boys. Most stores only sell pink and blue. If you don't know the gender of the baby, remove the caps, then spray paint them purple or yellow. Make your own baby bottles using mini jars and pacifiers. Purchase a pack of mini mason jars. Remove the caps and spray paint them pink or blue, depending on the gender of you baby. Let the paint dry, then hot glue a baby bottle nipple to the top of each cap. Replace the caps on the jars when you are done. Clean, empty baby food jars work great for this. Avoid using large mason jars. They are awkward to carry and you'll need more supplies to fill them with. If you don't know the baby's gender, spray paint the lids purple or yellow. Fill the bottles with powdered hot chocolate for a take-home treat. Purchase a box of powdered hot chocolate. Tear open each envelope, and empty it into each bottle. Fill the rest of each bottle with mini marshmallows. Fill larger baby bottles with cake mix. You can use store-bought cake mix or make your own. Add some sprinkles or chocolate chips, if desired. Don't forget to print the baking instructions and tie them to the bottles with ribbon. This is 1 instance where you can use baby bottles made from large mason jars.

Wrap the ribbon around the neck of the bottle, then tie it into a bow. If you used balloon/curling ribbon, use a pair of scissors to curl it. Make things personal by adding a label to the ribbon. Use a word editing program, such as Microsoft Word, to create a set of labels. Print the labels out, then punch a hole in the corner. Add the labels to the ribbons before tying them into bows.
