If you\u2019re planning on laying your tile in a diagonal pattern (which may require diagonal cuts), measure from corner to corner instead to make sure it will fit the tile cutter. You can typically buy a tile cutter for as little as $15-20 USD. Once you have one of your own, you\u2019ll be able to use it for all future tile cutting tasks, which means it will eventually pay for itself. For maximum versatility, look for a tile cutter with a rotating guide that will allow you to make cuts at different angles. Manual tile cutters work best for ripping standard ceramic and porcelain tiles. For tiles made from natural stone, you\u2019ll need to use a wet saw instead."

        "Check your measurements carefully before marking the tile, and use a straight edge to ensure that your lines are straight and precise.",
        "When you\u2019re done cutting, you can simply wipe off any remaining ink with a damp cloth.",
        "Set the guide plate on the saw table to ensure a precise cut.",
        "Most wet saws feature adjustable numbered guide plates that are situated perpendicularly to the blade.",
        "These plates are designed to hold the tile steady while you operate the saw.",
        "To change the position of the guide plate, pull the small end lever out, move the plate into the desired position along the built-in measuring guide, then push the lever in until it clicks to lock it in place.",
        "Always make sure the tile you\u2019re cutting is resting snugly against the guide plate.",
        "If there is any space between the tile and the edge of the plate, your cut may turn out crooked.",
        "If the model you\u2019re using doesn\u2019t have an adjustable guide plate, you\u2019ll need to line up the cut line you drew with the saw blade manually.",
        "Place the tile flat against the saw table with the glazed side up.",
        "Make sure it\u2019s oriented according to how you want to make your cut.",
        "If you\u2019re removing part of the vertical edge, you\u2019ll position the tile horizontally.",
        "If you\u2019re trimming the horizontal edge, you\u2019ll set it up vertically.",
        "In other words, your cut line should be positioned parallel to the saw blade.",
        "Turn on the saw and allow it to run for 15-20 seconds.",
        "Flip the power switch on the front of the saw base and give the blade a moment to get up to speed.",
        "For best results, it should reach top velocity before you attempt to cut the tile.",
        "It\u2019s a good idea to put on a pair of safety glasses before you begin sawing to protect your eyes from any tile particles or water droplets that happen to go flying during the cutting process.",
        "As the blade spins, the water from the reservoir will be pulled upward, wetting the blade and making it possible to achieve clean, smooth cuts without damaging the delicate tile.",
        "Feed the tile slowly into the saw blade.",
        "Use gentle, steady pressure to push the sliding table toward the blade.",
        "The idea is to let the saw do the cutting at its own natural pace\u2014you\u2019re just there to position the tile.",
        "Take your time and hold the tile steady with both hands as you work.",
        "To keep the tile from shifting, press it down into the surface of the saw table while pulling it back against the guide plate.",
        "Try not to apply too much pressure.",
        "Forcing the tile into the saw blade could cause it to crack, chip, or break completely.",
        "Be extremely careful to keep your hands clear of the saw blade at all times while it's in motion.",
        "It's far better to lose a piece of tile than a finger!",
        "Turn off the saw and allow the blade to power down before removing the tile.",
        "Once you\u2019ve made the necessary cuts to your tile, flip the power switch to the \u201cOff\u201d position.",
        "Wait 5-10 full seconds for the saw to stop spinning before removing your cut tile pieces or handling any other part of the machine.",
        "Failure to wait for the saw blade to come to a complete stop before reaching for the tile could result in serious injury.",
        "Don\u2019t forget to wipe off any last traces of your cut lines before installing the tile.",
        "Unplug the saw when you\u2019re finished using it.",
        "As a final safety measure, pull the electrical cord out of the wall outlet.",
        "This will help prevent accidents while the saw is not in use."
