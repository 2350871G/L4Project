If your hair is a red velvet, then you aren't going to have much success dyeing it a medium-brown; you'd be better off opting for a deep-brown.

Keep in mind that color doesn't lift color. If you've already dyed your hair, you won't be able to lighten it with a different color dye. However, you can dye your hair a darker color. A dark brown dye may take without you having to bleach yourself first."
