A ripe lemon will feel heavy for its size, be bright yellow, and have a skin that is textured with a finely grained peel. Use extra virgin olive oil. If you do not have it, buy some from your grocery store. Extra virgin oil is best because it tastes light and can be used to cook with almost anything. Plan to use about 3 cups (24 oz.) of oil to the 6 lemons. Many olive oil bottles come in a 1 liter (0.3 US gal) size, and this will work as well. Wash the lemons under cold running water. Allow them to dry by patting them with a paper towel or leaving them on a cutting board to air dry. Peel each lemon. Throw out any peels that have pieces of lemon flesh on them. Only the peel can be used in the infusion process, no fruit at all. Leave the peels to dry for at least 1 hour. If any moisture goes into the olive oil on the lemon peel, you will be at risk of growing bacteria or mold in your lemon olive oil. Put the dried lemon peels into any jar or container you have that comes with a tight fitting lid. If you are presenting the lemon olive oil as a gift, choose a decorative jar or something fancy. Look for a 1 qt. (.95 L) jar for this method. If you start with fewer or more lemons and oil, you will have to adjust or use several jars.
