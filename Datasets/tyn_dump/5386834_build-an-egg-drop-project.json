Open the shoe box and pad all sides of the box with facial tissues and cotton balls. Tape or glue may be used to keep the materials in place. Open the egg carton lid and remove two eggs from the bottom carrier tray. Cut the bottom of the egg carton the carton where the two eggs once were held. Dispose of or cook one of the eggs. Place the 2 bottom tray 'cups'- one on top of and one the bottom of the second egg and tape shut. Place 'cartoned' egg in the padded egg chamber. Seal the box shut with tape on all four sides.
