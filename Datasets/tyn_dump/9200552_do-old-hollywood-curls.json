Point the nozzle downwards to ensure that your hair dries sleek and smooth. If you have limp hair, it would be a good idea to add a root lifter in addition to the mousse. Alternatively, place a round brush beneath a section of hair, over-direct the hair at a 90 or 135 degree angle at the roots, and then continue blow drying down the strand as usual. Apply a light misting of light to medium-hold hairspray to your hair after you dry it. This will help the curls stay better."
