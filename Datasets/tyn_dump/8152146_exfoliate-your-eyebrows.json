You don\u2019t want to apply too much, but there should be enough for a thin layer across the entire brow. Facial scrubs are sometimes too soft to effectively remove the dead skin cells and stimulate the hair follicles. However, body scrubs are usually too rough. You may want to purchase a scrub designed specifically for the brow area. If you prefer all-natural skincare products, you may can make your own scrub for your brows. Mix 2 parts olive oil with 1 part sea salt in a bowl, and apply it to your brows. You can add a drop or 2 of your favorite essential oil to add a pleasant scent to the scrub if you like."
