Try to spread the cream cheese across the entire slice, with no bread showing. Top four slices of bread with baby spinach. Set out four slices of bread, cream cheese-side-up. Arrange the baby spinach on top in an even layer. It's okay if you overlap them a little, but make sure that they are spread flat and smooth across the cream cheese; don't just dump them on.
