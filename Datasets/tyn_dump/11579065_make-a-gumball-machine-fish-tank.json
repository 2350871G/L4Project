Remove the lid and scoop out any leftover sweet treats until the tank is completely empty. Square or rectangular gumball machines work best when you\u2019re trying to create an aquarium. While the candy and gum has a great color scheme, you can\u2019t keep these items in your future fish tank. Try to use a large gumball machine for this project. The average goldfish is happiest in a tank that\u2019s 120 by 50 by 50 cm (47 by 20 by 20 in). If you can\u2019t find a gumball machine close to that size, try using the largest tank that you can find."

Modifying the Lid for the Filter Cord Sketch out a rectangular portion of the lid to remove. Take a ruler and measure the length and width of your new filter. Take this measurement and mark it along the side of the gumball machine lid. While the filter will be on the outside of the tank, you won\u2019t be able to fit the lid securely over the clip-on device. Because of this, you\u2019ll need to cut a small rectangular portion of your metal lid off. Depending on the size of your filter, the rectangular section might be as large as 1 by 4 in (2.5 by 10.2 cm). Wear gloves and safety glasses before using power tools.

Don\u2019t worry about sanding this edge of the metal, as you only removed the metal so the filter could fit properly. Creating a Watertight Seal Saw off the central metal pole with a rotary tool. Use a handheld rotary tool to cut off any metal mixtures in the middle of your tank. Try to remove as much of the pole as you can, so you can cover its base with a piece of polycarbonate sheeting later on. If you don\u2019t remove this piece of metal, you won\u2019t be able to seal your tank properly. Trace the perimeter of your gumball machine onto a polycarbonate sheet. Set a sheet of polycarbonate material on top of your fish tank. Using a permanent marker, trace a rough line around the edge of your fish tank.

Depending on your gumball machine, you could have 4 or so screws on the bottom of your tank. Squeeze a line of sealant around the bottom perimeter of the gumball tank. Take your tube and apply a line of sealant along the linear or curved edges of the tank.

As you decorate the tank, aim to create a fun and engaging environment for your future fish. Avoid using decorations made of plastic and ceramic, as these can harm your fish. Fill your tank with water. Take a pitcher of filtered water and pour it into your gumball machine aquarium. Aim to fill at least 80% of the tank, leaving 1 cm (0.39 in) of space or less at the top. Turn on your power strip or outlet to power the filter, and your tank will be ready for new fish occupants! Check the instructions that came with your filter and see if the device needs to run for a certain amount of time before you can add fish. Operate your tank lights and filter with a power strip. Check that your filter and wired lights are all plugged into 1 power strip. Make sure that this power strip is turned on, so the filter is functioning and actively cleaning the water. Whenever you clean your fish tank, make sure that this power strip is turned off. If you don\u2019t have a lot of cords on hand, feel free to use a wall outlet instead. Add a small number of fish into your tank. Go to your local pet store or fish supply store and look for a small fish that would be a good fit for your tank. Look for smaller fish that won\u2019t take up as much space, like neon tetras. Unless your gumball tank holds at least 10 gallons (38 L) of water, only add 1-2 fish total into your aquarium. Talk to the pet or fish supply store associates to see which types of fish get along swimmingly, and if there are any predatory fish that you should watch out for. Place the lid back on the gumball machine tank. Secure your lid, or \u201chood,\u201d on top of your gumball tank. Always keep this item in place, so the fish aren\u2019t tempted to leap out of the water. Since you have a waterproof light attached to it, keep the lid in place to provide a consistent glow in your tank.",
