To give your arugula a bit more flavor, add a pinch of salt to the pot of water. Heat the water to boiling. Place the pot of salted water on a stovetop burner and heat it to boiling. Then, turn the heat down so the water bubbles gently. Place arugula in a vegetable steamer over the boiling water. If you don\u2019t have a steamer, you can rest a metal colander or strainer inside the pot, making sure the boiling water doesn\u2019t touch it. Use as much arugula as you think you will need. Cover the pot to trap the steam inside. Wilt the arugula for 2-3 minutes over the water. Allow the arugula to steam for a few minutes, or until wilted to your liking. Then, carefully remove the steamer from the pot of water and serve the arugula. Sauteing Arugula Heat chicken broth and spices on the stovetop. Put \u00bc cup (60 mL) of chicken broth (you may choose a reduced-sodium variety, if desired), \u215b teaspoon (0.5 mL) of onion powder, \u215b teaspoon (0.5 mL) of garlic powder, and a dash of pepper into a frying pan.

Add \u00bd of a chopped onion and 3 sprigs of thyme, with the leaves removed. Stir the mixture and cook it about 5 minutes, or until the onions are translucent.

Creating Goat Cheese and Arugula Stuffed Chicken Preheat your oven then pound the chicken cutlets thinly. Preheat your oven to 425\u00b0 F (218\u00b0 C).
