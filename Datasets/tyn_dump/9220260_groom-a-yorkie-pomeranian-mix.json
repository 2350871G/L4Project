Use a slicker comb to work out knots and tangles before switching to a regular bristle brush. Don't forget to show some attention to the hair around their arms, legs, ears, tail, and the upper part of their paws, as well. Tackle tangles gently with a slicker brush to avoid tugging on their hair. If the hair is badly matted, it may need to be removed with a pair of scissors. Double-coated Yorkipoms have a thick, lush covering of hair which should be brushed out daily to prevent mats and lumps from forming. For a single-coated breed with thin, wispy hair, a couple of times a week should be enough."

If it's too cold, they might start splashing, and that won't be fun for either of you! Only fill the sink to about half your dog's height so that they don't panic or have trouble standing.

You might even choose to bathe them several times a week if they spend a lot of time outside and tend to get dirty. Remember, a clean dog is a healthy dog, and one that's also more pleasant to be around. If you're having trouble finding the time to bathe your Yorkipom, scheduling regular visits to a dog groomer in your area can be a big help. Yorkipoms with thick double-coats can get by with daily brushing and fewer baths."
