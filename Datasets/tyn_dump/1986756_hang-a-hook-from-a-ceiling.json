It's the securest place to fasten a hook for heavy items so that you don\u2019t risk damaging the ceiling or the item. For items lighter than 5 lb (2.3 kg), you can use an adhesive hook as an easy alternative. Adhesive hooks come in various sizes and are easy to remove without damaging the paint on your ceiling. Note that adhesive hooks only stick to flat ceilings, not textured ceilings. If the item is especially heavy, such as a bike, you will want to balance out its weight using 2 screw hooks."
