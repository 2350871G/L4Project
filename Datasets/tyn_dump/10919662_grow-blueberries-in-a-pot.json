        "If the soil feels wet or soggy, hold back on the water until the soil dries up again.",
        "For the best results, water your bushes frequently but lightly several times a week.",
        "If you can, use rainwater on your blueberries.",
        "Rainwater has less of an effect on the soil pH than tap water.",
        "Drip irrigation is a great way to maintain the soil\u2019s moisture level.",
        "For example, use a plastic bottle with a hole in it to slowly leak water into the soil.",
        "Cover the soil with a 2 in (5.1 cm) layer of mulch.",
        "The best type of mulch to use is pine needles, pine wood, or chipped hardwood bark.",
        "These mulches are acidic, keeping the soil pH low for blueberry bushes to thrive.",
        "Mulch also insulates your plants, reducing stress from heat and water loss.",
        "Spread mulch as soon as possible after potting a blueberry bush.",
        "Mulch is useful all year, but it is especially beneficial during summer.",
        "Spread an organic fertilizer 4 to 6 weeks after planting the blueberry.",
        "For the best results, get an acidic slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Any fertilizers made for acidic soil plants like hydrangeas and azaleas are also great for blueberries.",
        "Slow-release fertilizers give blueberries a continual boost instead of a big dose of nutrients all at once.",
        "Add the fertilizer directly to the soil.",
        "Many growers choose ammonium sulfate.",
        "At a gardening center, ammonium sulfate will be labeled as 21-0-0.",
        "The number means it consists of 21 parts nitrogen, 0 parts phosphorus, and 0 parts potassium.",
        "Fertilizers with nitrate are dangerous for blueberry bushes.",
        "Read the ingredients carefully to make sure you don\u2019t apply this type of fertilizer by mistake.",
        "Cover plants with bird netting when the blueberries begin showing up.",
        "Blueberry plants produce fruit after 3 to 4 years of growth.",
        "Unfortunately, scavenging birds may get to the fruit before you do.",
        "While you\u2019re waiting for the blueberries to darken, drape netting over bushes.",
        "Most birds stay away for plants close to your home, but the netting prevents any brave ones from stealing your fruit.",
        "Bird netting is available online or at most garden centers.",
        "The fruit shows up anywhere from May to July, although the exact time depends on your environment.",
        "Blueberries ripen faster in warmer weather.",
        "Have your netting ready just in case.",
        "Maintaining Blueberry Plants Test and adjust the soil pH as needed to keep the plants healthy.",
        "Maintaining the soil\u2019s pH is one of the biggest challenges to growing fresh blueberries every year.",
        "Get a pH probe and dip it about 3 in (7.6 cm) into the soil.",
        "Amend the soil as needed to bring the pH back to a safe level.",
        "If the pH gets too low, try mixing dolomite lime into the soil.",
        "Lime is available at most home improvement stores.",
        "Continue adding pine mulch, cottonseed meal, or iron sulfate to lower the pH.",
        "Spread fertilizer 2 to 3 times a year starting in early spring.",
        "Add more of an acidic slow-release fertilizer to the soil each time.",
        "Sprinkle some on as soon as the bushes wake up in early spring.",
        "Add the final dose 2 or 3 months before the bushes go dormant in late fall.",
        "Be careful not to add too much fertilizer or use harmful nitrates.",
        "Read the manufacturer\u2019s label carefully to find out how much of the product to add to the soil.",
        "Adding too much is dangerous and may affect your blueberries.",
        "Another option is to add a light amount of fertilizer each month.",
        "Cottonseed or feather meal fertilizers are great for this.",
        "The best time to start this practice is in the plant\u2019s second year of growth.",
        "Prune blueberry bushes in early spring to remove old wood.",
        "Take care of your plants in February or March to prepare them for new growth.",
        "Use a sharp pair of shears to snip off about \u00bc of the old branches.",
        "Cut the branches off at the stems to give the new ones plenty of room to come in.",
        "Generally, you won\u2019t need to do much pruning in the first 2 years of growth.",
        "After that, trim off all of the old or damaged branches.",
        "Regular maintenance keeps your blueberries strong.",
        "Forcing the plant to use resources on new growth leads to bigger, better berries.",
        "Repot the plant once it begins to outgrow its old pot.",
        "Expect your blueberry bush to outgrow its original pot within 2 or 3 years.",
        "When it starts reaching the edge of the pot, transfer it to a new pot about 20 to 24 in (51 to 61 cm) in size.",
        "Replant the bush in acidic soil like you did originally.",
        "Take the time to examine the root ball.",
        "Trim away gnarly or excessive roots as needed to keep the plant contained."
