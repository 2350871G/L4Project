                    "description": "Rinse the tomatoes first. With a sharp kitchen knife, cut off the stems at either end of the tomato before slicing it in half vertically. Lay each half down on its side and slice them in half again, this time horizontally. Cut them one more time into even lengthwise strips before chopping them up into small \u20442 in (1.3 cm) pieces for saut\u00e9ing. Plum tomatoes work well for this recipe, but any variety of summer tomato can be used. Smaller tomatoes generally have a sweeter, lighter taste, while larger varieties have a richer flavor. For the most complex flavor to your paste, use several varieties of tomatoes. For a smoother paste, try seeding your tomatoes before finely chopping them. If you don\u2019t have a food mill to separate out the skins and seeds, you can easily remove the skins by blanching your tomatoes. After skinning them, chop them up as you would normally, and either manually remove the seeds as you go along, or push the pulp through a fine-mesh strainer to remove the seeds."

Hold the back of your hand over the pan, and if you feel the heat rising, add \u20444 cup (59 mL) of extra-virgin olive oil to a skillet at least 12 inches (30 cm) across. Let the oil heat for a few minutes before adding the chopped tomatoes. For the best flavor, use extra-virgin olive oil, though other grades of olive oil also work. If you don\u2019t have olive oil, you can substitute with canola oil, or a flavorless vegetable oil."

Bring them to a boil, stirring often, but letting them sit and reduce in the pan each time you stir. Cook until they\u2019re thoroughly softened, almost like a slurry. This should take around 10 minutes on a high heat. The tomatoes may splatter when you add them to the pan or as they\u2019re cooking. To avoid splattering, use a skillet with tall sides, or a pot. The amount of salt you add depends on your own taste. As a rule of thumb, add about \u20442 teaspoon (2.5 mL) of salt for every 5 plum tomatoes or 2 beefsteak tomatoes. For a different flavor, you could also add 3 cloves of peeled, smashed garlic and 2 bay leaves to the tomatoes as they soften. Just make sure to use the tomato paste in recipes that complement the strong flavor of garlic. For a unique flavor twist, you can skip the salt altogether and add 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of soy sauce instead."
