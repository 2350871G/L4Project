Most business cards are printed on 80 lb cover weight cardstock (215 grams per square meter), while some businesses prefer more durable paper  up to 110 lb (200 GSM). If using a home printer, check the manual to find its maximum paper weight. Cardstock too heavy for the printer may cause jamming, or (on a laser printer) flaking images. Many printers have a \"manual feed\" slot, usually behind a back panel, that sends thick paper through a straighter path, reducing the chance of bending or jams. On some printers you'll adjust the rear tray instead; follow the manual instructions for printing on envelopes."
