        "Remember the old adage: measure twice, cut once!",
        "Run masking tape opposite the cut lines on the board\u2019s rough side.",
        "Flip the board over and use the pencil marks you ran over the edges of the board to guide you.",
        "Center a strip of masking tape over the cut line (but on the opposite side of the board) and stick it in place.",
        "The teeth on power saw blades can splinter the surface of the hardboard as they cut up through the underside.",
        "The tape helps protect against this.",
        "Tape works best if you\u2019re cutting straight lines or gentle curves.",
        "If you\u2019re making sharper curves or more intricate cut patterns, clamp a sheet of particle board to the underside of the hardboard, as described in the hand saw directions in this article.",
        "Clamp the board to a sturdy, level work surface.",
        "To reduce board vibration while cutting, lay the board on a sturdy, level workbench, with only the area you plan to cut overhanging the edge of the bench.",
        "Secure multiple clamps to the underside of the bench and the top side of the hardboard\u2014use two where the board\u2019s overhang starts, and at least two more elsewhere, if possible.",
        "If you\u2019re using a table saw, lay the board (without clamps) on the saw\u2019s cutting table, aligned properly with the slit where the saw emerges during cutting.",
        "Limiting vibration is critical to smooth, accurate cuts with less splintering.",
        "Spring clamps\u2014which you squeeze to open and release to tighten\u2014and C-clamps\u2014which you screw and unscrew to tighten and loosen\u2014are both good choices here.",
        "Use a carbide cutting blade and take safety precautions.",
        "Whether you\u2019re using a table saw, circular saw, or jigsaw, choose a carbide blade with numerous, fine, and evenly-spaced teeth.",
        "This type of blade will slice right through hardboard without causing too much splintering.",
        "Along with choosing the right blade, take the time to follow all necessary safety measures as well.",
        "Use your saw\u2019s instruction manual\u2014or check the manufacturer\u2019s website\u2014for information on choosing and changing saw blades.",
        "When using any type of power saw, wear eye protection and hearing protection, wear long sleeves, remove all dangling jewelry and clothing, and tie back any long hair.",
        "Make each cut start-to-finish with an even pace and light pressure.",
        "With any type of power saw, it\u2019s important to move slowly and steadily, and to allow the saw to do the cutting instead of trying to force it through the hardboard.",
        "Follow the product instructions for the type of saw you\u2019re using, and consider the following tips:\nWhen using a jigsaw, start with the blade at the edge of your cut line, squeeze the trigger to start the saw, and guide it slowly and evenly along the cut line.",
        "A jigsaw is your best option for making curved or shaped cuts.",
        "When using a circular saw, you\u2019ll also want to line up the blade at the edge of the cut line and squeeze the trigger to slice through the board.",
        "Make sure not to press down on the saw\u2014allow it to glide freely as it cuts.",
        "When using a table saw, use the fence and both hands to guide the wood through the stationary, spinning blade that lifts up from the slit in the table.",
        "Work slowly and carefully, and use a pusher instead of your guide hand as it approaches the saw blade.",
        "Smooth the cut lines with medium-grit sandpaper as needed.",
        "Even if you tape the underside of the board, use a carbide blade, and cut slowly and evenly, you\u2019ll still end up with a few rough spots and splinters.",
        "To smooth these out, run a sheet or block of medium-grit (80-120-grit) sandpaper back and forth a few times over the completed cut.",
        "For an extra smooth finish, follow up with fine-grit (240 or higher grit) sandpaper.",
        "Cutting with a Hand Saw Put particle board under the marked hardboard before clamping it down.",
        "The process for measuring, marking, and clamping down the hardboard is the same for a power saw and hand saw, with one difference.",
        "Instead of running masking tape along the underside of the cut line, sandwich a sheet of 0.25 in (0.64 cm) thick particle board between the hardboard and your workbench.",
        "Use a pencil, measuring tape, and straight edge to mark your cut lines, and use at least two spring clamps or C-clamps to secure the board firmly to a stable, flat workbench.",
        "See the section of this article on cutting with a power saw for more details on measuring, marking, and clamping down hardboard.",
        "A handsaw\u2019s teeth rip into the underside of the hardboard when you cut.",
        "Putting the particle board on the underside will spare the hardboard from the brunt of the ripping motion of the saw\u2019s teeth, thereby reducing splintering.",
        "Clamp a scrap of lumber along your cut line to ensure a straight cut.",
        "Unless you have a lot of experience using a hand saw, it\u2019s harder than you think to cut a straight line.",
        "To help out, use two spring clamps or C-clamps to secure a straight piece of scrap lumber right against the cut line.",
        "This will serve as a guide to keep your cut straight.",
        "A piece of 1 in \u00d7 3 in (2.5 cm \u00d7 7.6 cm) dimensional lumber is a good choice here.",
        "Saw a full cut through the hardboard at a steady, even pace.",
        "Hold the saw blade at a 45-degree angle at the far edge of your cut line.",
        "Make two small upward strokes to create a notch, then start cutting with a smooth, steady, even rhythm.",
        "Keep going until you complete the cut\u2014don\u2019t lift the saw out of the channel and then try to start again.",
        "Even a smooth, straight cut with a handsaw will leave some rough edges on the hardboard.",
        "Smooth them out by passing medium grit (60-120-grit) sandpaper over the cuts several times, then follow up with fine-grit (240-plus grit) sandpaper if needed."
