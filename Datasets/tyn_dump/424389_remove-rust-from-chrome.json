        "Use a product only for its intended purpose, such as car wax for chrome-plated vehicles.",
        "Typically, wax is applied, buffed and left to dry, then a second layer is applied over it and buffed again.",
        "Apply silver paint.",
        "This will keep a nice shine on the chrome, but the level of rust protection depends on the brand of paint and how well it is applied.",
        "Select a paint appropriate to the task, typically automotive paint, and apply as evenly as possible over areas pitted by rust damage.",
        "Use a fine, 1200 grit sandpaper to smooth it down after it dries, taking care to avoid sanding unpainted areas.",
        "Get the object re-chromed.",
        "This is an expensive option, usually only performed on cars that were severely damaged by rust.",
        "Hire a mechanic who offers a chrome plating service if you want to re-chrome your car.",
        "If you're feeling ambitious, you can try to chrome plate objects at home, especially if they are relatively small."
