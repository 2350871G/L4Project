            "description": "Disconnect the computer cables, accessories, and peripherals. This includes the monitor, keyboard and mouse. Ensure that all cables are organized, untangled and enclosed in a small bag or box. A modern graphics card might be very heavy. You can remove it from the slot and ship it outside of the PC case to avoid stressing the connector if the package gets tossed around. Wrap the computer and peripherals in a suitable air-cellular cushioning material. Ensure that all parts are covered by at least 3 to 4 inches (7 to 10 cm) of plastic bubble wrap. Wrap each computer accessory separately to ensure maximum protection. Pack the wrapped computer tower inside a sturdy, cardboard box. Choose a box slightly larger than the computer to eliminate large areas of open space. Place the computer upright and fill all remaining space with additional cushioning. You want to ensure a tight fit so the computer fits snugly and will not shift during transit. Pack the computer monitor and accessories in the same manner as the computer tower, using appropriately-sized boxes. Place the packed computer boxes inside one large exterior box. You will again need to ensure that all boxes fit snugly to eliminate shifting during transit. Fill all open spaces with cushioning, foam or loose fill packing material to ensure a tight fit. Close and seal the exterior box securely with packing tape. Use at least 3 strips of pressure-sensitive tape to ensure a tight seal."
