                    "description": "The size of the kiln depends on what you plan to fire in it. You can make a small or large kin depending on what kind of pottery you make. If you plan to fire multiple pieces at once, write down the combined width and length of those pieces. Then multiply each figure by 1.5 to determine the interior measurements of the kiln. For example, if you wish to fire 4 pieces at once that are each 1 ft (0.30 m) tall, 1 ft (0.30 m) wide, and 1 ft (0.30 m) long, multiply 1 ft (0.30 m) by 1.5 and the combined width and length (4 ft (1.2 m) and 4 ft (1.2 m)) by 1.5 to determine the depth of the kiln. If you\u2019re producing many pieces, consider putting multiple shelves in your kiln. Using shelves, you can build a taller and narrower kiln that can hold more pieces. Depending on the height, you may need to build a metal frame to bolster the walls."
