Many grocery stores will carry jicama in the produce section, especially between fall and spring when it is in season. If you can't find it at a regular grocery store, try an organic foods store or a farmer's market. Specialty Mexican grocery stores may also carry jicama."

            "description": "When picking out jicama, look for roots that are smaller in size. As the root grows larger, its flavor dissipates and its texture becomes slightly tougher and loses its appealing crispness."

            "description": "Jicama's thick skin protects the flesh inside from rotting or drying out. Choose ones with smooth, shiny, and unblemished skins, as these will have the best-preserved interiors and will be least susceptible to bacterial and fungal infiltration. Dull and blemished jicama should be avoided. Check the stem end for green discoloration and do not purchase - this is mold."

            "description": "Once you have purchased your jicama, make sure to store it correctly. Jicama should be stored in a cool, dry place and left uncovered. Even a small amount of moisture can lead to rotting, so avoid putting jicama in the refrigerator. Jicama can be stored for up to 3 weeks. If storing cut jicama, cover the root loosely with a paper towel and place it in a plastic bag. The bag can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Before use, you may want to cut away some of the exposed flesh if it has become soggy or discolored."
