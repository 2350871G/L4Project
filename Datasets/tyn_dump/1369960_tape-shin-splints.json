                    "description": "You can purchase either trainer\u2019s tape or kinesiology tape to help relieve your shin splints. Tape will limit your range of motion and may allow more blood to flow to the injured area. You can get trainer\u2019s and kinesiology tape at most pharmacies and sports stores, and even some larger retailers. Some professionals suggest black tape, which may adhere better to sweaty skin. Though duct tape may work in a pinch, as it is as supportive as trainer's tape, duct tape was not meant to be used on skin, and therefore the adhesive is much stronger. If you tape your legs with duct tape, you risk blistering and shearing of the skin."
