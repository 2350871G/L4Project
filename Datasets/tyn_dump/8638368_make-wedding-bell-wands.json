You can use jingle bells or standard, trumpet-shaped bells. If you are using jingle bells, choose something small, about \u00bd-inch (1.27-centimeter) in diameter. If you are using standard bells, choose something tall, about 1\u00bd inches (3.81 centimeters). The twine will be visible and lend the wand a decorative touch.
