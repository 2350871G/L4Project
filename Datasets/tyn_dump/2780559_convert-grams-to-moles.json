The molecular mass of a substance is calculated as the number of atoms of each element multiplied by the atomic weight of that element. Knowing the molecular mass is necessary to convert grams to moles. Multiply the number of atoms each element contributes to the compound by the atomic weight of that element.

Molecular mass is also referred to as molar mass. Converting Grams to Moles Set up the conversion formula. The number of moles you have of a compound can be calculated by dividing the number of grams of the compound by the molecular mass of the compound. The formula looks like this: moles = grams of compound/molar mass of compound Plug your numbers into the formula. Once you have properly set up the formula, the next step is just putting your calculations into the correct part of the formula. An easy way to check that you have everything in the right place is by the units. Canceling out all the units should leave you with just moles. Solve the equation. Using a calculator, divide the number of grams by the molar mass. The result is the number of moles in your element or compound. For example, imagine you have 2 g of (NH4)2S and you want to convert it to moles. The molecular mass of (NH4)2S is 68.17g/mol. Divide 2 by 68.17, and you have 0.0293 moles of (NH4)2S.",
