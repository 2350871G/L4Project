Also, make sure you have some kind of video editor that lets you put music into pictures and stuff like that. (Ex. Windows Live Movie Maker, Windows Movie Maker, Sony Vegas, and etc.) Now, think of an idea for your series. Is it a love story? Is it a party? Killing? Randomness? Anything you can think of. Before you can start making the pictures, you have to find a place to keep your pictures. There are two options:\nMake a folder with the series name on it. Keep the pictures in the MMD folder. Once you make the folder, you may want to download some MMD models. Unless you're going to use the ones that come with MMD, go to YouTube or MikuMikuBeat. Store models in your downloads and make sure to put all of the other files that come in the folder in the downloads too. There are some people who make MMD models for you to download. After that, get some stages or pictures (make sure the pictures are .jpg) for the backgrounds. Store pictures in the \"Backgrounds\" folder which is in the MMD folder, and store stages in the downloads. Now, if you want, get some accessories. Store them in the downloads. After that, go online and find some music. VOCALOID/Anime songs will be most likely fitting (they are in Japanese, but you may want to learn a little about anime to get the idea on what it's about). You can also find instrumental songs for download, but make sure they are a .wav file. You can turn mp3s into .wavs using Audacity, which you can download here.
