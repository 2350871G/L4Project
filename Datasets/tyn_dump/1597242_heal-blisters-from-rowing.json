                    "description": "Some people believe it's best to leave a blister as it is until it heals because the skin over the blister is like a natural band-aid that provides a barrier against infection. Draining a blister increases the risk of infection, especially if you have a chronic condition like diabetes, HIV, cancer, or heart disease. If you can avoid draining it, the best way to let a blister heal is by applying a moleskin pad to it and leaving it undisturbed. Use a doughnut-shaped moleskin pad. This will leave the area directly over the blister open so it can breathe and heal. Moleskin pads reduce friction to the surface of the blister, allowing it to heal on its own. Change the padding daily, and keep the area clean."

A simple adhesive bandage will do, and it should help keep the skin intact while also reducing some of the friction. A bandage is more protective, but may not reduce friction as well as a moleskin pad. You can use clean gauze and medical tape to cover larger blisters. Change the bandaging every day, and keep the area clean."

Instead, the blister plaster acts as a second layer of skin, and protects the blister even when your skin is wet. Rub the blister plaster gently between your hands (provided your hands are clean). This can help improve the blister plaster's ability to stick to your skin. Apply the plaster taut over the skin, covering the entire blister. This will help reduce pain while allowing the blister to heal. Change the plaster daily, and keep the area clean."

However, if the blister is swollen, filled with fluid, and making it difficult to row or perform other tasks, then you may want to consider lancing and draining the blister in a sterile procedure. Only you will be able to accurately assess how functional your blister is.

                    "description": "Before you touch your blister, it's important to have clean hands. This will help reduce the chances of your blister becoming infected. Wet your hands with clean, running water. Lather soap between your hands by rubbing them together. Scrub your hands for a minimum of 20 seconds. Be sure to apply soap under your fingernails, between your fingers, and on the fronts and backs of both hands. Rinse your hands free of all soap and dirt/debris under clean, running water. Dry your hands with a clean paper towel, and use the towel to turn off the faucet to avoid touching any unclean surfaces. If you do not have access to clean, running tap water, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer to disinfect your hands. However, this will not be effective in removing dirt and grit from your hands. Apply enough hand sanitizer to cover both hands, then rub it over every surface of your hands and fingers. Let it air dry when you're finished."

It's very important that the needle be clean, sharp, and sterilized, because a dirty, rusty, or dull needle can cause injury or infection if you lance the blister with it. You can buy a sterile lancing needle from most drug stores, or sterilize a clean, sharp needle at home. There are numerous ways to sterilize a needle. Some people hold the needle over a flame, while others pour boiling water over the needle. The safest way to sterilize a needle is to simply pour some rubbing alcohol onto a clean cotton swab, wipe the needle down, and let it air dry."

Be careful not to stab the muscle or the deeper skin layers underneath your blister; you merely want to penetrate the outer layer of skin on the blister itself. Larger blisters may require multiple punctures. Be sure to insert the needle close to the edge of the blister for each incision."

You may need to gently massage some of the fluid out if it does not drain well on its own. Be gentle and do not rush through it. Take the time to ensure you get all the serum out of your blister.

Applying a thin layer of ointment, such as Vaseline or Neosporin, to the blister can help your skin return to its normal, elastic state. An antibacterial ointment has the added benefit of cleaning the wound while it's covered. Don't apply too much ointment. The wound will need to be able to breathe, and excess ointment may reduce the flow of oxygen to your skin. Cover the blister with sterile, non-stick gauze, and use medical tape to keep it fixed in place. Be sure that you do not accidentally apply tape to the blister itself, as this may cause significant pain when you remove it. Change the dressings every day, and keep the area clean.

        "This will help reduce the chances of your blister becoming infected.",
        "Wet your hands with clean, running water.",
        "Lather soap between your hands by rubbing them together.",
        "Scrub your hands for a minimum of 20 seconds.",
        "Be sure to apply soap under your fingernails, between your fingers, and on the fronts and backs of both hands.",
        "Rinse your hands free of all soap and dirt/debris under clean, running water.",
        "Dry your hands with a clean paper towel, and use the towel to turn off the faucet to avoid touching any unclean surfaces.",
        "If you do not have access to clean, running tap water, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer to disinfect your hands.",
        "However, this will not be effective in removing dirt and grit from your hands.",
        "Apply enough hand sanitizer to cover both hands, then rub it over every surface of your hands and fingers.",
        "Let it air dry when you're finished.",
        "Disinfect the blister's surface.",
        "Even though you've washed your hands, it's a good idea to disinfect the blister itself.",
        "This is to prevent any outside bacteria from being introduced into the blister once you puncture the surface.",
        "Apply iodine to a clean cotton swab or a clean piece of paper towel.",
        "Swab the blister, including the area immediately surrounding the blister, until it is completely covered.",
        "Let the iodine air dry.",
        "Sterilize a clean, sharp needle.",
        "Now that your hands are clean and the blister has been swabbed with iodine, you'll need to sterilize the needle.",
        "It's very important that the needle be clean, sharp, and sterilized, because a dirty, rusty, or dull needle can cause injury or infection if you lance the blister with it.",
        "You can buy a sterile lancing needle from most drug stores, or sterilize a clean, sharp needle at home.",
        "There are numerous ways to sterilize a needle.",
        "Some people hold the needle over a flame, while others pour boiling water over the needle.",
        "The safest way to sterilize a needle is to simply pour some rubbing alcohol onto a clean cotton swab, wipe the needle down, and let it air dry.",
        "Puncture the blister.",
        "Using the now-sterilized needle, carefully puncture the blister near its edge (where it meets the rest of your finger or hand).",
        "Be careful not to stab the muscle or the deeper skin layers underneath your blister; you merely want to penetrate the outer layer of skin on the blister itself.",
        "Larger blisters may require multiple punctures.",
        "Be sure to insert the needle close to the edge of the blister for each incision.",
        "Let the fluid drain out.",
        "Getting the serum (fluid) out of your blister is the most important part of the process.",
        "You may need to gently massage some of the fluid out if it does not drain well on its own.",
        "Be gentle and do not rush through it.",
        "Take the time to ensure you get all the serum out of your blister.",
        "Leave the overlying skin from the blister in place.",
        "Removing it will cause a large, open sore that could easily become infected.",
        "Apply ointment and cover the blister.",
        "Your skin may be stressed from the injury and subsequent punctures.",
        "Applying a thin layer of ointment, such as Vaseline or Neosporin, to the blister can help your skin return to its normal, elastic state.",
        "An antibacterial ointment has the added benefit of cleaning the wound while it's covered.",
        "Don't apply too much ointment.",
        "The wound will need to be able to breathe, and excess ointment may reduce the flow of oxygen to your skin.",
        "Cover the blister with sterile, non-stick gauze, and use medical tape to keep it fixed in place.",
        "Be sure that you do not accidentally apply tape to the blister itself, as this may cause significant pain when you remove it.",
        "Change the dressings every day, and keep the area clean.",
        "Use more ointment as needed.",
        "Treating a Torn or Drained Blister Wash the area clean.",
        "Whether your blister has torn open or you lanced and drained it, it's important to keep the area as clean as possible.",
        "You should wash the area once each day, and any additional times as needed if the area is exposed to dirt or bacteria.",
        "This is particularly important if you continue to row, as river and lake water is full of bacteria that could easily cause an infection.",
        "Use soap and water.",
        "Do not use alcohol, peroxide, iodine, or any other wound cleanser, as these will irritate the skin and prolong the healing process.",
        "Follow the same guidelines for washing your blister wound as you would for washing your hands.",
        "Keep the flap of skin in place.",
        "If the flap of skin covering the deflated blister gets very dirty or if there is still pus remaining under it, you may need to remove the skin flap.",
        "It's best to let a doctor do this, as she will be able to ensure your injury does not get infected.",
        "Otherwise, leave the skin flap in place so it will help protect the open sore underneath.",
        "If the skin gets bent out of place, gently smooth it back into position over the open sore.",
        "Do not attempt to cut or pull away the skin at home, as this will drastically increase the risk of infection and prolong the healing process.",
        "Apply ointment and a clean bandage.",
        "Once you've washed the blister wound and smoothed the skin back in place, you'll need to protect the wound.",
        "Apply enough antibiotic ointment to sufficiently cover the blister, then cover it with a clean bandage.",
        "If your blister grows itchy or develops a rash, stop using the ointment and see your doctor as soon as possible.",
        "Change the bandage every day, and any time it gets dirty or wet.",
        "Keep the area clean.",
        "Remove the bandage at night to allow the wound to breathe.",
        "Take an over-the-counter pain reliever.",
        "You can take acetaminophen or ibuprofen to relieve some of the pain caused by the blister and to speed up healing.",
        "Read the manufacturer\u2019s instructions to find the proper dosage, or talk to your pharmacist or doctor if you are not sure how much to take.",
        "Preventing Future Blisters Maintain a proper handle grip.",
        "A common cause of rowing blisters, especially for those just starting out, is improper handle grip on the oars.",
        "If your grip is too tight, you're likely to develop blisters.",
        "If it's too loose, though, you could lose your hold on the handle altogether.",
        "Maintain a loose, relaxed grip, but keep proper form and a correct grip on the handle.",
        "It can take a long time to learn how to properly hold on to the handle.",
        "Don't get discouraged.",
        "Just keep with it, and ask your coach or a more experienced rower for advice on your technique.",
        "Keep your oars clean.",
        "A dirty or greasy oar handle will not necessarily cause blisters in and of itself.",
        "However, it can make it difficult for you to maintain the proper grip on your handles, which may cause blisters.",
        "Use an abrasive cleaning product and clean paper towels to scrub down the oar handles after every workout.",
        "Wear non-slip gloves.",
        "If you're comfortable rowing in gloves, a good pair of non-stick rowing gloves can help you keep on top of your rowing without the risk of blisters.",
        "You can find these at many sporting goods stores, or by searching online.",
        "Tape up your hands.",
        "If you're not comfortable wearing non-slip gloves while you row, you can try taping your hands instead.",
        "Use regular, store-bought duct tape for this, but make sure the tape is clean to prevent irritation or infection.",
        "Use a pair of scissors to cut a piece of duct tape.",
        "It should be slightly larger than the spot on your hand(s) that is prone to getting blisters.",
        "Apply the piece of duct tape to your palm.",
        "Press down in the center and smooth the tape in outward strokes to remove any lumps or wrinkles.",
        "Toughen up your skin.",
        "It may be painful and frustrating in the meantime, but eventually your hands will get tougher in the spots that are most prone to blistering.",
        "This can take time, and it's important to be patient while your skin toughens.",
        "Do not let it deter you; it's important to keep rowing until your skin builds up a tolerance to the motion.",
        "Increase your rowing time or intensity gradually.",
        "If you rush to lengthen the time you spend rowing or your intensity, you will easily cause blisters.",
        "Figure out a schedule for yourself that will allow you to increase your time and intensity slowly over several days or weeks.",
        "This is something you will have to determine for your own abilities and endurance.",
        "Don't be afraid to push yourself, but know your own limits."
