You can print your image and text in color or in black and white. After you print out your logo or image, cut it out with a sharp pair of scissors. If the logo features text in it, then you will need to reverse the text to ensure that your words don\u2019t show up backwards on the shirt. If you\u2019re making a logo for your band, then create it using photoshop or another software program.Tip: If you have a blank T-shirt in your closet, you can use that to create a band T-shirt. If not, try checking a yard sale or second-hand store for blank T-shirts."
