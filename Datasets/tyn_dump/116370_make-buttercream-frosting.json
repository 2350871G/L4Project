        "If you have been using a higher speed in your mixer, now is the time to change it to a low setting.",
        "Add the chocolate and mix it some more.",
        "You may have to use a spatula to get all of the chocolate out of the bowl.",
        "Add the rest of the ingredients and mix on a medium speed.",

        "If you cannot tell whether or not the sugar has dissolved, you can rub the mixture between your fingers.",
        "If the mixture feels grainy, the sugar has not finished dissolving.",
        "Let the mixture heat until it reaches 160\u00b0F (72\u00b0C).",
        "This pasteurizes the egg whites and kills any salmonella-causing bacteria.",
        "Be sure to use an instant-read thermometer.",
        "Remove the mixture from the double-boiler and continue mixing it until the egg whites become stiff.",
        "At this point, you can use an electric mixer or transfer it to a food processor with a whisk attachment.",

        "You can give your buttercream a more interesting flavor by adding some extract, flavoring oil, or milk.",
        "Keep in mind that flavoring oils have a much more intense flavor than extracts, so you won't need as much.",
