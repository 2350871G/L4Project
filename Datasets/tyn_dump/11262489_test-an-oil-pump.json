Pop your hood and check the top or side of your engine for the pressure sender unit. Locate the nut holding the sender in place and use a spanner wrench to loosen it. Set the sender unit aside while you\u2019re working so it\u2019s out of the way. Some oil may come out from the port for the sender once you remove it. Keep a shop cloth or rag nearby to catch any spills. Test your oil pressure manually even if you can check it on your vehicle\u2019s dashboard. The sender unit could be faulty or you may have loose wiring inside your vehicle that may give a false reading. The \u201cCheck Oil\u201d notification on your vehicle\u2019s dashboard may light up when you disconnect the sender.Warning: Don\u2019t remove the sender unit while your engine is still warm after running your car. The heat thins the oil and makes it flow easier, so it could spill a large amount once the unit\u2019s taken off."
