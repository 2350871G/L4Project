Summer is the best season for fishing for sea bass in Southern California, but they can be caught into the fall and winter months.

You want to get the attention of the barracuda, which are often followed by the white sea bass. Mackerel works well in this situation because the barracuda will typically not try to feed on it. If a recently-caught white sea bass happens to swim by, this can be an opportunity to catch it in its weakened state."
