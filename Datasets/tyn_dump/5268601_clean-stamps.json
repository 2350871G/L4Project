You can use 2 different sponges if it's easier for you to have 1 wet sponge and 1 dry sponge. Use 2-sided sponges and just use 1 side of each. Rub a stamp on the wet side of the sponge after you stamp something. Rub the ink-covered stamp against the damp soapy side of the sponge until you get off all the ink. Scrub the sides of the stamp as well if there is any ink on them. If you do this while the ink is still wet, right after stamping, then you should be able to remove most of the ink without scrubbing hard or aggressively.
