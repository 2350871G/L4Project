Use your measurements of the van\u2019s interior to cut pieces of insulating material that will fit over the floor, walls, and ceiling of the van. There are many different types of insulation material you can use, including rigid foam, Styrofoam, rock wool, and natural sheep wool. Although different insulation materials come with different installation instructions, a lot of these instructions call for placing roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) of insulation material on the walls and floors, and roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) to 2 inches (5.1 cm) of material on the ceiling. Use spray foam on any remaining cracks or gaps in the installation."

Cut your pieces of plywood or batten so that they will fit your van\u2019s interior, then securely screw this subfloor into the floor of the van to act as a fixing point for the rest of your flooring. Once the subfloor is installed, repeat this process to cut and install your top floor, making sure it is securely screwed into the subfloor below. Commonly recommended types of wood to use for the top floor include laminate, sheet vinyl, and timber."

Measure and cut a piece of plywood for the base of the platform, taking into account any curves found on the sides of your van\u2019s walls. If you\u2019d like to build extra storage space into your platform, cut a piece of 2x6 lumber into 9 pieces roughly 9 inches (23 cm) high, and screw them into the base plywood in a 3 by 3 formation. These will act as pillars to support your top platform while also providing extra storage. Measure and cut a piece of plywood equal to the size of your bottom platform, and screw it into the pillars to act as your top platform. Consider assembling your bed platform entirely inside the van; if you construct the platform outside the van and it\u2019s too big, it won\u2019t fit and you\u2019ll have to make adjustments."

Cut a piece of plywood that will serve as your countertop, making sure it is big enough to include your sink, water container, and whatever else you deem necessary, but also small enough to fit in the van. Cut a square hole in the plywood that is just slightly smaller than your portable sink, so that your sink fits snugly inside the hole in your countertop. Use 2x4 lumber to build a frame for your counter, making sure to stick closely to the measurements you took of the interior van at the outset of the project. Cut your 2x4 into 8 shapes: 4 pieces you will screw together into a rectangle to support the countertop, and 4 pieces that will act as legs to support the entire counter.
