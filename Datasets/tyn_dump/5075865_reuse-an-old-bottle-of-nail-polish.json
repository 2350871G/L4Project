The nail polish thinner will help to release any congealed nail polish, making it usable again. Use as usual, until it's all gone.  Cleaning Out an Old Bottle of Nail Polish Work over a surface where it's okay to make stains. One good way is to line a counter with several layers of newspaper and work over an old ice cream container placed on this paper surface. See Warnings below for ventilation and proper disposal. Tip the bottle over to empty out any nail polish that will come out on its own. Tip into a lidded container ready for proper disposal. This step may not be applicable, if so, simply skip to the next step. Add a few drops of nail polish thinner or paint thinner in the bottle if there are dried-up remnants of nail polish.

If you don't need the brush but you do need the lid, such as for one of the storage options, simply snap the brush off at the highest point possible and dispose of it. Turning the Bottle into a Mini Vase Clean the bottle. See the cleaning method of the article for this. Remove the lid completely, as it is not needed for this project. Decorate the bottle. Use nail polish from other bottles to paint pretty designs onto the bottle. For example, flowers, stripes, patterns, etc. Allow to dry. Decide whether you'd like to add other features too. For example, you might stick on small artificial gems, beads or sequins. Use. The tiny vase can be used to hold a small bunch of dried flowers or leaves, or it could hold incense sticks, or anything long and skinny that you find decorative. Making Your Own Nail Polish Clean the bottle. See the cleaning method for this. Keep the brush applicator intact. Start experimenting with making your own nail polish colors. Choose eyeshadow colors that you think would be interesting when combined with nail polish colors. Choose one eyeshadow to one nail polish to begin with. Alternatively, choose clear nail polish if you just want the eyeshadow color. Start adding drops of nail polish and small amounts of powdered or crushed eyeshadow to the cleaned bottle.  Shake the bottle to combine the colors and items. If you like what you see, continue adding the colors in the same ratio, so as to make enough for continued use. If you don't like the colors, either abandon this combination (clean the bottle again), or adjust the ratios. Keep experimenting. Making your own nail polish colors can be a lot of fun and will have people asking you where you get your colors from. Using the Bottle for Makeup or Travel Clean the bottle. See the cleaning method for this. Decide whether or not keeping the brush is useful by the end use you're seeking. Use the bottle to keep loose makeup in. If makeup is powdery or liquid in nature, it may be suitable for storing in the bottle. This can be helpful if you have broken a container or if you only need a small amount to take with you to work or college. Use the bottle to keep cosmetics in when traveling. You can add shampoo, conditioner, makeup, etc. to the little bottle for short travel trips. Even liquid detergent for washing your delicates could be stored in the bottle. Use it for taking nail polish remover with you when you travel. Just be sure to screw the lid on very tightly. Storing Craft Items Clean the bottle. See the cleaning method for this. Decide which craft items would benefit from being kept in a small storage container. Some suggestions include: Glitter, sequins, seed or tiny beads, small buttons, tiny modeling items, etc. Simply fill the bottle with these items, then attach the lid (with the brush snapped off). When you need the little items or glitter, they'll be very easy to locate and use. Reuse the bottle as a glue dispenser. If you're tired of tipping up the huge bottle of craft glue every time, siphon some into the little glass bottle. Use the brush applicator in the lid to apply glue to your craft projects with ease. Keep hobby or modeling paints inside the nail polish bottle. This makes it easy to mix colors too and keep the mixed color longer.",
