        "The equator is 0\u00b0, with the North Pole at 90\u00b0 N and the South Pole at 90\u00b0 S. Use the scale on the side of the map to determine how far north or south your latitude is.",
        "Start at the Equator, and work your way up or down the horizontal lines on the map until you\u2019ve found the corresponding location on the side of the scale.Tip: Longitude and latitude are usually listed in degrees (\u00b0) with a cardinal direction (north, south, east, or west).",
        "Sometimes, the coordinates will be given in time.",
        "These coordinates replace south and west with a minus (-) in the front of them.",
        "On a world map, the guidelines often represent 15\u00b0 each, so the first guideline above the equator is 15\u00b0 N, and the second guideline is 30\u00b0 N. So if your latitude is given as 44\u00b0 56\u2019 9.816\u2018\u2018 S, start at the Equator and move down 3 horizontal lines to reach 45\u00b0 S. Your latitude will be just above this line.",
        "Keep in mind, your scale may be different and each line may represent increments of 5, 10, or 30 degrees.",
        "Use the Prime Meridian to find the longitude going east or west.",

        "Start at the Prime Meridian and move left or right based on your map\u2019s scale until you\u2019ve located your approximate location.",
        "For example, if your longitude is given as 116\u00b0 32\u2019 8.192\" E, and your scale lists every guideline as 10 degrees, start at the Prime Meridian and move 11 lines to the right to reach 110\u00b0 E. Then, move halfway to the middle of the 2 guidelines and slightly to the right to get near 116\u00b0.",

        "Move 1.15 mi (1.85 km) for every 1 minute in your coordinate.",
        "To make minor adjustments to your location, include the minutes listed after the degrees in your calculation.",
        "For example, 44\u00b0 56\u2019 lists 56 in the minutes position.",

        "For 44\u00b0 56\u2019, this corresponds to 64.4 miles (10,360,000 cm).",

        "You can get even more accurate by adding 80 feet (24 m) for every 1 second.",
