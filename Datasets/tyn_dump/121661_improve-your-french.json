Good pronunciation helps to ensure that you are easily understood and will enable you to enjoy speaking the language more fluently. Ways to improve your pronunciation include:\nListen to native French speakers and repeat what they say. Watch a good French movie and imitate your favorite actor's accents. Listen to native French speakers on your iPod or MP3 player as you're traveling to work, and repeat what they say (when appropriate). Sing French music. Download your favorite songs and sing along. Music is an excellent method by which to perfect accent, and most times, you won't even notice the effort involved. Ensure that you have a good French teacher. If you're not studying as part of your college curriculum, take up French classes after work, or on the weekends. Your teacher should be able to help correct your pronunciation by picking out your weaker points and giving you specific exercises to improve your intonation, inflexion, and sound linking."

            "description": "As with your native language, aim to make learning vocabulary a lifelong learning process. While learning vocabulary gets easier the more you do it, and the faster you are able to work out meanings by context and association, it can be helpful to continue learning vocabulary as a discrete exercise in its own right. The best ways to do this include:\n\nKeep a notebook for writing down words you discover when reading, or listening to some other kind of media. You can choose to look them up later rather than constantly interrupting a good read with dictionary hunting. It is helpful to use categories for the words, such as travel, clothes, body, fashion, car, movies, etc. to make finding the words easier, and to provide contextual association in your mind. Make use of Post-It notes to write down the names of household items. Create a scrapbook. Cut out pictures of items by theme and add the French words to them. A craft exercise on the one hand, a French lesson on the other! Use events that interest you to provide intrinsic motivation for learning new words. For example, if you're a soccer (football) fan, why not watch the games in French, and learn new words? When you learn a new word in your native language, look it up in French at the same time. Read the instructions accompanying your appliances and software in French. Most manuals now come in a range of languages, making it easy for you to learn new technological or technical terms quickly, with the ability to cross-check with the English version. Aim to learn 5 new words every day - that amounts to 35 new words a week, 1820 words a year! Buy a visual dictionary in French. It does not need to have any English in it, although bilingual visual dictionaries do exist. This is an inspiring and very useful way to learn a wide range of vocabulary and is particularly helpful for technical terms that you might need for work, or for a hobby.

Just be sure to pick books that interest you, fiction or non-fiction. Or, if books are not your thing, try reading wikiHow in French.
