                    "description": "Put a saucepan over medium heat and melt the butter in it until it turns brown. Then, add the onions to the pan and cook them until they\u2019re caramelized, which should take about 15 minutes. Finally, stir in the garlic and cook the ingredients together for 3-4 minutes. Medium heat is the middle setting on a stovetop dial. For example, if the burner on your stove ranged from 1 to 10, then medium heat would be the 5 setting. If you want to make your soup slightly healthier, you can use olive oil instead of butter to saute the onions and garlic."

Stir the spices as you add them to the pan so that they spread evenly throughout the mix. Continue to cook the mix until it\u2019s steaming and fragrant, which should take about 5 minutes. You don\u2019t necessarily have to add any spices to the mix, but they do give the finished soup a nice kick.
