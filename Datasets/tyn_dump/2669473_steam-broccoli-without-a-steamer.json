        "Choose a saucepan with a lid that fits snugly.",
        "If necessary, you can use a heat-resistant dinner plate as a lid.",
        "Add the broccoli to the saucepan once the water comes to a boil.",
        "Place the saucepan over high heat and wait for the water to come to a full boil.",
        "Since there\u2019s such a small amount of water in the saucepan, this won\u2019t be a long wait!",
        "Place the thicker, tougher stalk pieces in the saucepan first, then pile the tender florets on top.",
        "Be careful not to splash any of the boiling water onto your skin.",
        "Cover the saucepan and keep it over high heat for 3 minutes.",
        "Don\u2019t lift the lid, shake the pan, or anything else.",
        "Just wait 3 minutes!",
        "It is crucial that you cover the saucepan securely in order to trap the steam inside.",
        "A snug-fitting lid that matches the saucepan is your best option.",
        "Reduce the heat to low and steam the broccoli for 3 more minutes.",
        "Do not remove the lid to check the broccoli\u2014you need to keep the steam trapped inside.",
        "This trapped steam  will continue to cook the broccoli without overcooking it.",
        "Add butter or seasonings, if desired, and serve the broccoli immediately.",
        "After 6 minutes total steaming time, carefully lift off the lid.",
        "Stir the broccoli, and stir in 2 Tbsp (30 g) of butter if you wish.",
        "Consider sprinkling on a pinch or two of salt as well.",
        "Remove the lid so that it acts as a shield to deflect the steam away from your face.",
        "Otherwise, you may get burned.",
        "Once finished, the broccoli should be bright green and tender-crisp.",
        "Mushy, drab green broccoli has been cooked too long.",
        "You can serve the broccoli from the saucepan, or transfer it to a serving dish.",
        "Using a Colander as a Steaming Basket Rinse and cut up a head of broccoli.",
        "Run the head of broccoli under clean water, check for any insects hiding in the florets, and dry it with paper towels.",
        "Use a sharp kitchen knife to cut the florets into bite size pieces, and slice the stalks into 0.125 in (3.2 mm) discs.",
        "If the stalks are especially thick, cut the discs in half.",
        "Aim to make the florets roughly similar in size\u2014about 1 in (2.5 cm)\u2014so that they cook evenly.",
        "The stalk pieces take longer to cook and should be cut smaller than this.",
        "Use an average size head of broccoli, which should weigh about 1 lb (450 g).",
        "You can discard the stalks if you like, but they\u2019re quite tasty and tender when steamed properly!",
        "Pick out a stock pot, lid, and metal colander that suit your needs.",
        "You\u2019ll need a metal colander that\u2019s large enough to hold all the chopped broccoli.",
        "At the same time, it needs to be the right size to nestle into the stock pot and rest on its rim so it doesn\u2019t touch the bottom of the pot.",
        "The lid should fit over the colander and create a fairly tight seal to keep the steam in.",
        "If the colander doesn\u2019t nestle in just right, it will either touch the bottom of the pot (which will result in some of the broccoli boiling instead of steaming) or will stick up too far above the rim of the pot (which will let the steam escape).",
        "If you don\u2019t have the right combination of stock pot, lid, and metal colander, you\u2019re better off either using an alternate steaming method or buying a steamer basket that fits your stock pot.",
        "Add 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm) of water to the stock pot.",
        "2 in (5.1 cm) is preferable, but don\u2019t add that much if it causes the bottom of the colander to be submerged when you nestle it in the stock pot.",
        "Make sure you have at least 1 in (2.5 cm) of water in the pot, however.",
        "You need at least 1 in (2.5 cm) of water to build up enough steam to cook the broccoli.",
        "Bring the water to a boil over high heat.",
        "Since there\u2019s a small amount of water in the stock pot, it won\u2019t take more than a few minutes to come to a boil.",
        "Place the cut broccoli in the colander while you wait, if you haven\u2019t done so already.",
        "Put the colander of broccoli in the stock pot and add the lid.",
        "Wait until the water is at a full boil before doing this.",
        "Move on to the next step\u2014reducing the heat\u2014as soon as you put the lid on.",
        "Make sure the lid is on snugly so the steam can\u2019t escape.",
        "Reduce the heat to medium-low and check the broccoli after 5 minutes.",
        "Tender florets may be done after 5 minutes, but plan for 6-7 minutes in most cases.",
        "Put the lid back on if the broccoli isn\u2019t bright green and easy to pierce with a fork after 5 minutes, then check again 1 minute later.",
        "Repeat once more if necessary.",
        "Steamed broccoli can turn drab green, mushy, and unappetizing quickly, so check every minute after the first 5 minutes of steaming.",
        "Season your broccoli to taste and serve it right away.",
        "Remove the colander from the stock pot and pour the broccoli into a serving dish.",
        "If desired, stir in 2 Tbsp (30 g) of butter and a pinch or two of salt.",
        "Try adding lemon juice, balsamic vinegar, or toasted almond slivers to your steamed broccoli.",
        "Some people even like their steamed broccoli with mayonnaise on the side!"
