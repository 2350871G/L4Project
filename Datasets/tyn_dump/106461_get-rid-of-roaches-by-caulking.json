Just say no to cockroach \"bombing\". To really cure this problem, you need to be in a place you are going to stay for awhile. If you'll only be there for a month or two, you might just want to find a different place. Otherwise it is not labor or cost effective. This worked for us. We got rid of 100% of the cockroaches in our apartment without exposing ourselves or our kids to toxic pesticides. No more checking my kids in the night and seeing a giant pregnant one crawling across the headboard (Gut reaction: Kill! Kill! Kill!). We used the barrier method. It may not be 100% effective in preventing pregnancy but it works pretty damn good for bugs. Basically, roaches live in the walls. People don't, so we decided not to care if they did. We just stopped them from coming out into our side of the apartment (outside the walls). Let's get started!"
