Marinaded pork chops are great both baked and broiled. They retain moisture well. The type of vinegar you use will alter the way the marinade tastes. Apple cider vinegar adds a subtly fruity taste and generally is a good accompaniment to pork. Wine vinegars have a more potent, complex taste, and balsamic vinegar offers a blend of sweet and sour flavors. You can experiment with various types of other flavored vinegars until you find one that appeals to your personal sense of taste. Experiment with the ingredients of the marinade as desired. In general, marinades need to have an acid, like vinegar, and an oil. Other flavors can be contributed depending on the sweeteners, condiments, spices, and herbs you use. For example, another popular choice for pork chops is a marinade consisting of soy sauce, garlic, and ginger. Other acids, like pineapple juice or lemon juice, can be used instead of the vinegar."

Place each pork chop, one at a time, in the resealable plastic bag holding the crushed stuffing mix or crumbs. Seal the bag and give it a shake to coat all sides of the chop. Baking Pork Chops Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (218 degrees Celsius). Prepare a baking pan by coating it with melted butter or nonstick cooking spray. Both marinades and breaded pork chops can be baked. Nonstick aluminum foil or parchment paper can also be used instead of butter or cooking spray. Place the pork chops in the prepared pan.

Note that for some marinades, the juices will always have some tint of color due to the color of the marinade. Serve warm. Let rest for at least 3 minutes before serving. Broiling Pork Chops Preheat the broiler. Pull out a broiler pan with an interior rack. Broil marinaded pork chops, but avoid using this method with breaded pork.

Transfer the pork chops to the broiler pan. Place the chops on the rack, spacing them evenly apart and in a single layer. Cook the chops 5 to 7 minutes on each side. Place the pan on the top rack of the oven. Cook for 5 minutes or until the top begins to brown. Flip and continue cooking until the other side is also brown. The finished pork chops should have no pink inside. Serve warm. Let rest for 3 to 5 minutes before serving.",
