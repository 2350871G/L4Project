    "text": " Cooking in the Microwave Make a cheddar cheese queso dip in the microwave. This low-hassle recipe makes about five cups of queso dip. Cut the cheddar cheese into one inch cubes. Cubing the cheese allows it to melt faster. If you do not cut it into small chunks before heating, portions may melt too quickly and burn, while the center remains solid. If you do not want to cube your cheese, try buying shredded cheese, or shred it yourself. Mix all three ingredients together. Combine the prepared cheese, diced tomatoes, green chiles, an chili beans in a microwavable glass bowl. Be sure the ingredients are mixed together evenly. Microwave for five minutes on a high setting. Pause the microwave after three minutes, and stir the dip. Stirring the dip disperses the heat, promoting more even melting. The dip is finished once all the processed cheese has melted. Feel free to add your own seasoning such as ground cumin, garlic, diced onion, or Worcestershire sauce to add more flavor. Serve hot. Stir the dip once more after pulling it out of the microwave. This will ensure that all of the cheese is melted, and the ingredients are well mixed. Queso dip can be served with tortilla chips, wheat crackers, or fresh vegetables. Cooking on a Stove-Top Try this stove-top recipe for a traditional Velveeta queso dip. This recipe makes about six cups. Whisk together the milk and corn starch. Combine the two ingredients in a medium saucepan, and whisk until the mixture is smooth. There should be no lumps in the mixture after you finish whisking it. You could also use chicken stock, or beer, instead of the milk, depending on the flavor you want. Milk will create the creamiest, richest flavor, beer will create a heartier flavor, and chicken stock will create a smoother dip. Add in salsa. Decide the heat level you want your salsa to be, and then whisk the salsa into the saucepan until well-combined. Use a chunky salsa if you prefer a chunkier, thicker queso dip. Bring the dip to a simmer. Heat the saucepan over medium until the mixture reaches a simmer. Do not cover the top. Stir in the Velveeta and sour cream. The sour cream can be added all at once, but the cheese should be added one handful at a time, stirring well after each addition. To prevent the cheese from burning, allow each handful of cheese to melt before adding more in. Stop adding cheese once the dip reaches your desired thickness. Feel free to add your own seasoning such as ground cumin, garlic, diced onion, or Worcestershire sauce to add more flavor. Heat for an additional minute. After the dip reaches your desired thickness, allow it to heat through for another minute or two to be sure it is fully melted together. Serve warm. You can serve the hot queso dip right out of the saucepan, or pour it into a serving dish. Serve the queso dip with chips or vegetables. Cooking in a Slow Cooker Utilize your slow cooker for a rich chili-queso. This is a great way to make queso and keep it warm for several hours at a time because you can serve it right from the slow cooker. This recipe makes about six cups. Combine the cream cheese and half of the diced tomatoes. Empty one can of diced tomatoes and green chiles into the slow cooker. Do not drain the can of tomatoes and chiles. Then, add the cream cheese in the slow cooker. Cut the cream cheese into one inch cubes to help it melt evenly and to prevent it from burning. Turn the slow cooker on high. Cook the diced tomatoes and cream cheese for approximately 15 minutes, or until the cream cheese completely melts. Do not cover the slow cooker. Stir the dip mixture occasionally as the cream cheese melts. Stir in the Velveeta. First, make sure you cut the cheese into small cubes. Add the cheese to the slow cooker one handful at a time to prevent burning, and stir well after each addition. Continue stirring the cheese in until all of it melts completely. Add the remaining tomatoes and chiles. Pour in a little at a time, stirring until the mixture thickens to a dip consistency. The mixture is at a dip consistency when you can stick a chip into it. Add in the rest of your ingredients. If you chose to add chili beans, ground beef, or any other ingredient, do it at the end. The chili beans and ground beef need to be fully cooked before adding them in the queso dip. Feel free to add your own seasoning such as ground cumin, garlic, diced onion, or Worcestershire sauce to add more flavor. Sprinkle with cilantro and serve warm. Set the slow cooker on low and serve. Keep the slow cooker set on low up to four hours and serve the dip fresh. The queso dip can be served with tortilla chips or vegetables. If your slow cooker has a warm setting, use that instead of the low setting.",
