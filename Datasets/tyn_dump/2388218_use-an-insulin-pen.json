You can avoid this by rotating your injection sites. Pick an appropriate body region and use that area for one to two weeks, but move around within that area with each injection. Inject at least 2 inches away from your last injection site. It may help to keep a chart of where you inject yourself so that you can remember. For instance, you can note that this week you injected into different areas of your right thigh, so that next week you can move to your left thigh or abdomen. Rotate in a clockwise or counterclockwise way to help keep track of your injection sites."
