                    "description": "These layers will help you stay dry and warm by wicking moisture away from your skin, providing insulation, and protecting you from the wind and snow or rain. The inner layer should wick sweat away and fit close to your skin. Opt for synthetics or silk. This layer should keep you dry and not feel scratchy against your skin. Avoid cotton because it will hold moisture, which will quickly turn chilly. A good example is a long sleeved tech shirt. The middle layer is to keep you warm. Pick a fabric that will keep heat against your body without holding moisture, such as a fleece jacket or vest. Experiment to determine how thick this layer should be, depending on the temperatures in your area. The outer layer should provide protection from wind and moisture. It should also be easy to unzip or remove if you get too warm. A lightweight windbreaker is a good choice, and if you need to take it off, you can tie it around your waist.
