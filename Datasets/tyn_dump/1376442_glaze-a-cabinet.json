        "Go with the grain, rather than against it.",
        "Apply a liberal amount, making sure to thoroughly coat the section and ensure the glaze gets into any recesses of the cabinets.",
        "Once applied, the glaze should appear uneven and darker than your desired results.",
        "It\u2019s a good idea to have multiple foam brushes available in different sizes and shapes to help you cover every part of the cabinets.",
        "You may also choose to apply the glaze with a clean rag, rubbing it into the cabinets using a circular motion.",
        "Wipe off the excess glaze with a clean rag.",
        "Remove the bulk of the glaze until you can clearly see the grain of the wood or the paint color underneath.",
        "Continue to wipe, using circular motions, until you\u2019re satisfied with the results.",
        "If you like the look of the glaze, but want it a little darker, re-apply the glaze to the same section and leave it to sit for 5 to 10 minutes before wiping it off.",
        "If you don\u2019t like the results, or decide you want to use a different color, you can remove the glaze using paint thinner and a clean rag.",
        "Continue glazing and wiping in sections until the cabinets are covered.",
        "Use the exact same process you did with the first section to achieve a uniform look.",
        "As you work around corners and crevices, make sure the glaze gets into those areas.",
        "If you have trouble wiping it away with the cloth, you can use a cotton swab or clean foam brush instead.",
        "Working in 2\u20133 ft (0.61\u20130.91 m) sections instead of glazing every surface of the cabinets at once allows you to fix any mistakes and evaluate your work before the glaze dries.",
        "Glaze the doors using the same process you did with the cabinets.",
        "Use the same number of coats in order to achieve a cohesive look once the doors are reattached.",
        "You want the cabinets and doors to match in color and texture as closely as possible.",
        "It\u2019s up to you whether or not you want to glaze the inside of the doors as well as the outside.",
        "If you do decide to glaze the inside, make sure you let the outside dry thoroughly before you turn the door over to avoid ruining your work.",
        "Leave the cabinets to dry for at least 24 hours.",
        "Generally, this is enough time for the glaze to completely dry.",
        "However, it\u2019s a good idea to check the glaze container for specific manufacturer guidelines on drying times.",
        "Touching Up and Cleaning Inspect the cabinets for flaws and consider adding more to the grooves.",
        "Don\u2019t forget to check corners, crevices, and any recessed areas in the cabinets and doors, as these places are easy to miss.",
        "There may be areas where there isn\u2019t quite enough glaze, and other places where extra glaze has collected during the drying process.",
        "This is also the time to decide if there are any areas you want an extra layer of glaze, to achieve a more dramatic look.",
        "For example, you can apply an additional layer of glaze in the grooves of the cabinet doors if you want more dimension.",
        "Touch up any areas as needed.",
        "Apply another layer of glaze to any areas needing touch-ups, using the same process you did the first time.",
        "For the best results, only apply a small amount of glaze in exactly the places you want to touch up, and then wipe clean.",
        "If there are any spots of glaze that need to be removed, do this using paint thinner.",
        "Clean the foam brushes in mineral spirits and dispose of the rags.",
        "Fill a small cup full of mineral spirits and gently dip the foam brushes into it, swirling them around a few times to help dissolve the remaining glaze.",
        "This will prevent the brushes from becoming stiff and allow you to use them for future touch-ups or other glazing projects.",
        "While you can also clean the rags using the same method, it requires a great deal of mineral spirits to dissolve all the glaze, so it\u2019s easiest to simply throw them away.",
        "Remove the painter\u2019s tape and drop cloths.",
        "Grab each piece of tape at the corner and peel the tape back slowly, holding the end of each piece at approximately a 45-degree angle.",
        "It\u2019s important to take your time with this process and try to keep each piece intact as you remove it.",
        "You don\u2019t want to leave behind small pieces of painter\u2019s tape, which can be difficult to remove.",
        "It\u2019s a good idea to store your drop cloths rather than throwing them away.",
        "They may be useful for future glazing, staining, or painting projects.",
        "Reattach the cabinet doors and hardware using the screwdriver.",
        "Once the cabinets are completely dry and you\u2019re satisfied with the color and evenness, it\u2019s time to reassemble them and admire your results!"
