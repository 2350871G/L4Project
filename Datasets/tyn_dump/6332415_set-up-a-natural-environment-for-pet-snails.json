Choose a plastic or glass enclosure with a removable lid instead of a cage or open container as this will keep the soil moist and reduce the chance that your snails could escape. Snails prefer cool, dark environments, so keep the tank in a place out of direct light. Placing the tank away from sunlight helps to maintain the temperature of the habitat and prevents your snails from getting too hot, becoming dry or dehydrated, and dying."
