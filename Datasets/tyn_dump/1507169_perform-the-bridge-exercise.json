As you lie down, make sure to keep your knees bent and hip distance apart, and the soles of your feet planted firmly on the floor. Walk your heels back as close to your buttocks as possible. If it is easier, scoot your buttocks toward your heels. You'll need to use the strength of your feet and your glutes to help you lift up."
