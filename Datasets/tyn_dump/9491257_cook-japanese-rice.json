    "text": " Straining Japanese Rice Measure the amount of rice you want to cook. 1 cup (8 oz) of uncooked rice makes about two cups of cooked rice. Start with at least 1 cup (8 oz) of rice, as smaller amounts do not cook evenly.Depending on how much rice you want to make, measure your rice out and pour it into a stove pot. Fill a pot with cold water. Add enough water to cover the rice completely. Do not add enough water in to fill the pot. The rice should be wet and submerged but not floating in the pot. Use your hand to swish the rice around for 2-3 minutes. Swishing the rice gives it more contact with the water so that the grains can absorb more moisture. This will prevent your rice from going mushy as they cook. Pour out the water while using a strainer to catch the rice. The water poured out should be a milky white color. If the water is still clear after your first time, you may not have swished around the rice enough. Swish the rice again for a longer time to attain the right color. Strain the rice again 3 to 4 times until the water poured out is almost clear. Watch the water drain as you strain the rice again. Each time, you should notice a lighter color. Do not stop straining the rice until it is clear or translucent. Pour your rice into a strainer after the fourth time. Let all the excess water drain out of the pot, then transfer the rice back in. This will keep the rice from getting too sticky as you cook it. Keep the rice sitting in the pot for 3-5 minutes until continuing to cook your rice. Cooking Japanese Rice on a Stovetop Add water to the pot for boiling the freshly-strained rice. For every 1 cup (8 oz) of rice you cook, you will need 1 cup (8 oz) plus 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) (1 oz) of water. Follow this ratio precisely to avoid brittle or mushy rice. If you prefer drier rice, only add 1 cup (8 oz) of water. Let the rice sit in the pot for 10 minutes before cooking. If the rice absorbs water, it will cook at a more even pace. Wait at least 10 minutes before boiling the rice to avoid under- or overcooked rice. Place a lid over your pot and turn the stove to high heat. Do not open the lid while your rice is cooking, as the rice needs steam to cook. Opening the pot lid releases steam and will prevent your rice from cooking. You'll know when the water is boiling by listening to the pot. If you have to, lift the lid to check if the water is boiling before covering the lid. Turn your stove to low heat after about 5 minutes of boiling. Let the rice cook on low heat for about 5 more minutes, which should give the water enough time to absorb. Listen for the water to change from a loud boil to a soft simmer to make sure the water temperature lowers. Turn the heat off after 5 minutes but keep your rice covered for 10 more minutes. This will give your rice a softer texture. After 10 minutes have passed, stir the rice for about 30 seconds and serve. Using a Rice Cooker to Steam Japanese Rice Let the strained rice soak in a bowl filled with water for 30 minutes. The water should completely cover the rice. This will give your rice a softer, more even texture as it steams. After 30 minutes, drain the water out of the bowl with your strainer. Transfer the rice to your rice cooker. Check your rice cooker instructions for the right rice-to-water ratio as well as how to use your specific rice cooker. Close the cooker after adding the water, and let your rice cook for 15-20 minutes. Set the rice cooker's automatic timer for a precise cooking time. Let your rice steam for 5-10 minutes after it is done cooking. Waiting 5-10 minutes will give your rice a softer texture.

Keep your hands and face away from the rice cooker as you open it to avoid steam burns. Then, fluff your rice with a rice paddle and serve it as desired. Making Sushi Rice Combine the strained rice with water in a saucepan. Transfer the rice to a saucepan and add water. For every 1 cup (8 oz) of water, you should add 1.5 cups (12 oz) of water. Your saucepan should have large sides to keep the water from spilling as it boils. Let the rice sit for about 3-5 minutes before turning on your stovetop. 5 minutes of sitting will allow your rice to cook evenly as it absorbs water. Do not cover your saucepan when you turn on the heat. Sushi rice does not need to be steamed until the saucepan is boiling. Cover your saucepan with a lid and bring it to a boil for 5 minutes. Turn the stove to high heat and let your rice boil for about 5 minutes. Avoid opening the lid while your rice boils. When you open the lid, steam escapes from the pot. Turn the stove to low heat. Keep the rice boiling for an extra 20 minutes. Again, keep the lid closed\u2014if you cannot resist the temptation to peek, try using a clear lid so you can watch the rice as it cooks. Turn off the heat and let your rice sit for about 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, take off the lid and check the rice's texture. It should be soft and tender when it has absorbed enough water. Transfer the rice to a bowl and leave it to cool. Combine rice vinegar, vegetable oil, white sugar, and salt in a saucepan. Add 1/4 cup (2 oz) vinegar, \u20442 tablespoon (7.4 ml) (1/4 oz) vegetable oil, 1/8 cup (1 oz) white sugar, and a pinch of salt into your saucepan.
