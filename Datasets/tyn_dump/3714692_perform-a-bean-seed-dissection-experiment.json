    "text": " Preparing for the Experiment Gather your lab materials. You will need a bowl, water, dried beans, a knife, a journal, and a magnifying glass. You can use any large bean such as a kidney or lima bean. You may also consider having a worksheet or print out of the bean\u2019s structures. Use different kinds of beans to compare the seed structure across multiple varieties. Soak dried beans in the bowl of water for 12 to 24 hours. You want the beans to be soft enough to cut. This will allow you to perform the dissection without destroying the bean. An easy cut is essential to preserving the structures inside the bean. Hypothesize what the bean will look like on the inside before you cut it. Write your thoughts down. Include an illustration of what you believe the inside of the bean will look like. A basic sketch is okay if you do not draw well. Dissecting the Bean Split the bean in half. There is a line that runs down the middle of most beans. Use this line to guide the bean open. The bean should be evenly split. Use a knife if you need to cut the bean in half along this line. An adult should cut or supervise the cutting of any beans. Examine and observe the inside of the bean. Use a magnifying glass to see all of the details of the bean. Some structures may not be easily recognizable to the naked eye. Make notes or sketch what you see. Look at multiple beans of the same variety so you can notice the similarities of their insides. Identify the parts of the bean seed. You will find the embryo, cotyledon, and the seed coat. Label each of these structures on a diagram. If you don\u2019t have a diagram, sketch the structures out in your notebook. Concluding the Experiment Compare your observations to your hypothesis. Look at the predictions you made in your journal before the experiment. Determine how many of the structures you predicted are actually in the bean. Record your comparisons in your journal alongside your hypothesis. Ask yourself:\nWas your hypothesis correct? If not, what was different? Compare a dry bean with a soaked bean. Now look at a dry bean. This bean will have the same structures, but they may be visibly different. Record your comparisons in your journal. Answer things like:\nWhat are the similarities? What are the differences? Observe the soaked bean after it has dried. Allow the soaked bean time to dry. Observe the same bean again. The embryo will be easier to identify when the bean is dry. Record your observations in your journal.",
