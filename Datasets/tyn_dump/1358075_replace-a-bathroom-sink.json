In most cases, the clips are adhered in place with a 2-part epoxy that hardens in about 10 minutes after being combined. Follow the product instructions carefully and apply the proper amount to each clip. Then press them into place as per the installation instructions for your sink. Wait 24 hours, then install the drain. Even though the epoxy should be fully set in 10 minutes, it\u2019s important to give the silicone adhesive time to cure fully. Leave the piece of lumber and bar clamp in place for a day before removing them. After that, you can put the drain in place and continue with the installation. Like faucets, drain installations vary by type and brand, but the process is DIY-friendly if you follow the instructions carefully. You could rely on the epoxy to hold everything in place after 10 minutes and not wait the full 24 hours before proceeding, but this is not recommended. Be patient! Making Final Connections and Testing Allow the caulk on a top-mount sink to cure for 24 hours. Instead of making the final connections right away, it\u2019s better to give the silicone caulk time to set up. This will prevent the sink from shifting and breaking the solid bead of caulk that you made. If you\u2019re installing an undermount sink, you should already have waited 24 hours before putting in the sink drain. In this case, you can proceed with the last steps of the installation. Reconnect the water lines and the P-trap underneath the sink. You just need to do the reverse of the disconnecting process. Hand-tighten the water lines where they connect to the hot and cold shutoff valves or use a crescent wrench if needed. Similarly, use your hands to tighten the nut on a PVC P-trap or channel locks for a metal P-trap. If your new sink drain is a little shorter than your old one, you can buy a P-trap pipe extension at your local hardware store. The extension can be cut to fit and will also connect in place with a nut that you\u2019ll either hand-tighten or secure with channel locks. If your new sink drain is a little too long, you can cut off some of the pipe either at the top of the P-trap or the bottom of the drain. Use a hacksaw or pipe cutter to make the adjustment. Turn the water back on and check for leaks. Open the hot and cold water valves by turning them counterclockwise. Then, open the hot and cold faucet taps fully and let the water run for at least 2-3 minutes. Watch under the cabinet for any leaks in the water lines, drain lines, or elsewhere. Tighten any loose connections as needed. Keep the bucket or towel at the bottom of the sink cabinet while you test for leaks. If you have a leak at a pipe connection, try shutting off the water, undoing the connection, wrapping some plumber\u2019s tape around the pipe threads, and then re-making the connection. If you can\u2019t figure out where a leak is coming from and/or how to fix it, shut off the water supply lines and call a plumber.",

        "If you are not experienced with this type of project, you may be better off with a new faucet and drain, since they will come with detailed installation instructions.",
        "Faucet and drain installations will vary quite a bit based on the particular brand and model you select.",

        "If you\u2019re missing a clip or 2, it\u2019s possible that the clips from your old sink may work.",
        "Run a bead of caulk around the rim of the sink where it meets the countertop.",
        "Your goal here is to create a waterproof barrier between the rim of the sink and the countertop so that water can\u2019t seep in under the sink rim.",
        "Once you\u2019ve run the bead of caulk around the sink rim, wet your index finger and run it around the entire bead to smooth the caulk in place.",

        "Remove the holding clips under the sink while supporting it from below.",
        "Although it will be a tight fit in the sink cabinet, this is safer and easier with a second set of hands helping you.",
        "While the second person holds the bottom of the sink, remove the several clips (often 4-6) that pin the sink rim against the underside of the counter.",
        "They will either be screwed or epoxied into place.",
        "If they\u2019re attached with screws, simply use a screwdriver to remove them.",
        "If they are stuck in place with epoxy, use a putty knife to scrape, pry, and wedge the clips apart from the underside of the counter.",

        "Install the faucet, but not the drain, in the new sink.",
        "Unlike with a top-mount sink, don\u2019t install the drain before installing an undermount sink.",
        "But it\u2019s easier to install the new faucet now instead of having to work from inside the sink cabinet.",
        "Installing a faucet is within the skill set of most DIYers, but the process differs based on the type and model of faucet.",
        "Closely follow the instructions that come with the new faucet.",
        "Apply a bead of silicone caulk around the entire top rim of the sink.",
        "Use a silicone caulk designed for bathroom applications.",
        "Make sure the bead is continuous around the entire rim of the sink.",
        "Like the stuff you removed from the old sink, this caulk is mostly there for waterproofing, but also helps hold the sink in place.",
        "Secure the sink in position with a piece of lumber and a bar clamp.",
        "Cut a section of 2 in \u00d7 4 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 10.2 cm) lumber so it\u2019s at least a few inches/centimeters longer than the width of the opening for the sink in the countertop.",
        "Lay this piece of wood across the opening.",
        "Then, while a second person lifts the new sink up into place from beneath, feed the bar clamp up through the drain opening of the sink so that one of its clamps holds up the sink from below.",
        "Secure the other clamp to the piece of wood and tighten it.",
        "Make sure the clamp is tight enough to make the some of the silicone caulk squeeze out between the rim of the sink and the underside of the counter.",

        "Secure the included clips in place with screws or epoxy.",
        "Your new undermount sink will come with support clips to place around the underside of the sink where it meets the underside of the counter.",
        "In some cases, these clips may attach with screws.",
        "If so, drill pilot holes and use a screwdriver to secure the clips in place.",
        "Otherwise, use the brand or type of epoxy recommended by the sink manufacturer.",
        "In most cases, the clips are adhered in place with a 2-part epoxy that hardens in about 10 minutes after being combined.",
