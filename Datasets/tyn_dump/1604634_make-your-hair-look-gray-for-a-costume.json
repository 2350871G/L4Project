Even though the powder is white, the natural color of your hair will come through to make your hair look like it\u2019s gray. If you want a subtly older look, just brushing the powder at the temples is enough to make you look older and grayer, since people tend to go gray first around the temples. Focus on working the powder from the roots of your hair up, especially around the hair that frames your face. Since hair naturally greys from the roots up, this will give it a more realistic appearance. Make sure to avoid getting powder on your face. Brush away powder with a wet cloth if you get it on your forehead or neck."
