    "text": " Creating a High Ponytail Spray some hairspray to the roots of your hair. This is especially important if your hair has been recently washed, because the hairspray will keep your hair from slipping out of the elastic. Lift your hair in large sections and apply hairspray at the roots. Section your hair into three or four sections. You don\u2019t want too many sections, since this will make your ponytail look very, very curly. For Sandy\u2019s look, you only need three to four big, loose curls, so section your hair into four equal sections - one on each side and two in the back. Once you've sectioned your hair, spray it with heat protectant for the straightener doesn't damage your hair. Use rollers to make curls. Place a 1.25 inch (3 cm) wide roller about midway between your roots and the tips of your hair. Curl your hair around the roller until you reach the end of your hair. Once the hair below the roller has been fully rolled, roll the roller one rotation up into the hair above the roller. Then secure it with a roller clip. Repeat this process for each section of hair. Use a straightener to heat the curls. Use a 1 to 2 inch (2.5 to 5 cm) wide straightener and clamp it over the roller. You should leave it there for 5 seconds or so, just long enough for the hair to heat up and the curl to set. Remove the rollers and brush the hair through. Pull the rollers out of your hair by pulling the roller straight out, horizontally. If you unwind your hair instead, the curl won\u2019t hold as well. Brush through the curls gently with a flat paddle brush. Spray the curls with a bit of hairspray. This will ensure that your curls keep their shape, even once they\u2019re pulled into a ponytail. Hold the can or bottle of hairspray about 2 inches (2.5 cm) away from your hair and spray down the length of it. Section your hair at the temples. This top section of your hair will form the top of your ponytail. Use a comb and draw a horizontal line straight back from just above your temple to the crown of your head. Hold this section of hair away from the hair underneath, and then use a comb to draw a horizontal line straight back from the opposite temple so the comb meets the hair you already have sectioned off. Then secure the two sections into one section with a clip. Brush the loose hair into a ponytail. A wide toothed comb is best here, since it won\u2019t damage your curls. Brush the loose hair up into a ponytail, making sure the sides of the ponytail are tight and sleek. Secure the ponytail at the crown of your head with an elastic. Brush the sectioned hair back. Take the sectioned hair out of the clip and brush it straight back, joining It with the existing ponytail. Then secure everything together with another elastic. Back brush your ponytail. Starting in the middle of your ponytail, gently brush the hair up, slowly moving toward the end of your hair. This will give some additional shape and volume to your hair. If you notice any flyaways on the side of your head, smooth them down and give them a spritz of hairspray. Wearing Your Hair Straight with Bangs Wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner. It\u2019s best to use a conditioner with some heat protection in it. This prevents your hair from getting damaged from the blow dryer or straightener. Squeeze the moisture out of your hair after you've washed it. You don't want it to be dripping wet, but it should still be damp. Apply Moroccan oil to your hair. You only need a small amount \u2013 slightly smaller than the size of a dime \u2013 for hair that is to your shoulders. Use a bit more if your hair is past your shoulders. Rub the oil on your hands and then run it evenly through your hair. Spray your hair with a heat protectant. Even if you use a conditioner that protects your hair from heat, a spray heat protector will help keep your hair shiny and healthy. Spray the protectant all over your hair and then use your hands to run in through your hair and evenly distribute it. Attach the flat attachment to your hair dryer. This attachment will look something like a fan, and will force the air out of your dryer in an almost horizontal line. This should make your hair flat, smooth, and shiny. Blow dry your hair to about 40% dry. You don\u2019t want your hair to be completely dry when you\u2019re done with this step since you\u2019ll be applying more heat later. Dry it just enough so that the dampness is almost taken out of it. Use a flat paddle brush to dry your hair to about 90% dry. Brush out a section of hair with your paddle brush. As you run the brush from root to tip, follow along with your blow dryer. Your dryer should be almost touching your hair on the brush. Use a straightener to straighten your hair. Once your hair is almost completely dry, it should look mostly straight. However, to get the super straight look Sandy has in Grease, you\u2019ll want to go back over your hair with a straightener. Using a 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide straightener, section your hair into small sections and run the straightener over each section slowly, moving from root to tip. Your hair shouldn't be completely dry for this step, since using a straightener on completely dry hair can be damaged by the straightener. Curl your bangs. Once most of your hair is finished, you\u2019ll need to curl your bangs. Use a round brush with a small barrel - less than 2 inches (5 cm) wide. Place the brush under your bangs, holding it horizontally. Start at your roots, rolling your blow dryer forward to the tips. Follow the brush with your hair dryer. If your bangs have dried out by the time you get to them, rewet them with a spray bottle of water or a wet comb. Brush your hair. Using a paddle brush, gently brush your hair out. You should look like Sandy in no time! Getting the Greaser Look Spray your hair with a bit a hairspray if it\u2019s clean. This helps your hair hold the curl. If you don\u2019t use spray, the curls could pull themselves out and your hair will end up straight. Section your hair into at least 6 sections. Start the sections by creating one near your neck. Use a comb to create a horizontal part near the base of your neck and pile the rest of your hair on top of your head. The loose hair will be where you start your curls. The more sections you have in your hair, the curlier it will look. Spray each section with thermal spray. Before you curl your hair, spray each section with a heat protectant or thermal spray to protect it from the heat of the curling iron. It\u2019s best to spray as you go. If you spray your whole head before you curl your hair, parts of your hair will dry before you get to them, defeating the purpose of using a spray protectant. Curl the hair around a curling wand. An 18 mm (0.7 inches) barrel curling wand or iron will give the best size curls for this style. Starting at the root of your hair nearest the base of your neck, curl your hair around the wand or iron. You can roll your hair over or under the wand or iron, depending on what feels most comfortable. Hold the wand or iron as vertical as possible. Hold your hair there until you feel it heat up. It should only take 2 or 3 seconds. Work from the back of your head toward the front. Coil the curl flat against your head. Push the curl toward the surface of your head so it lays flat but coiled up. Secure it with a hair clip so it keeps its shape while you work on the rest of your hair. Repeat this process until you\u2019ve curled all of your hair. Release your curls. Once you\u2019ve finished curling and setting your hair, you can take the clips out. Unclip each curl and let them fall naturally. If you want slightly bouncier curls, leave them clipped for about five minutes after you\u2019re finished curling your hair. Use a comb to tease the roots for volume. Once you\u2019ve released your curls, use a comb to tease your hair at the roots. Make sure you only comb down from the root of your hair to the curl. Use your fingers to brush through your curls. Once your hair is teased, finger-brushing your curls helps to separate them a bit without causing them to frizz. Spray your curls with hairspray as you finishing finger-brushing them. Comb back a small section on the side of your head. Just like with teasing your roots, you shouldn\u2019t pull the comb all the way through your hair. Start at about your temple on the left or right side of your head and comb straight back, stopping where your curls begin. Your hair should lay flat against your head on this side. Insert a hair comb. Starting a few inches (5 to 6 cm) away from your roots, insert a hair comb into your hair, pushing it forward toward your temple. Give a final spritz of hairspray. Once your hair is set, give it another couple of squirts of hairspray to set it.",

        "Secure the ponytail at the crown of your head with an elastic.",
        "Brush the sectioned hair back.",
        "Take the sectioned hair out of the clip and brush it straight back, joining It with the existing ponytail.",
        "Then secure everything together with another elastic.",
        "Back brush your ponytail.",
        "Starting in the middle of your ponytail, gently brush the hair up, slowly moving toward the end of your hair.",
        "This will give some additional shape and volume to your hair.",
        "If you notice any flyaways on the side of your head, smooth them down and give them a spritz of hairspray.",
        "Wearing Your Hair Straight with Bangs Wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner.",
        "It\u2019s best to use a conditioner with some heat protection in it.",
        "This prevents your hair from getting damaged from the blow dryer or straightener.",
        "Squeeze the moisture out of your hair after you've washed it.",
        "You don't want it to be dripping wet, but it should still be damp.",
        "Apply Moroccan oil to your hair.",
        "You only need a small amount \u2013 slightly smaller than the size of a dime \u2013 for hair that is to your shoulders.",
        "Use a bit more if your hair is past your shoulders.",
        "Rub the oil on your hands and then run it evenly through your hair.",
        "Spray your hair with a heat protectant.",
        "Even if you use a conditioner that protects your hair from heat, a spray heat protector will help keep your hair shiny and healthy.",
        "Spray the protectant all over your hair and then use your hands to run in through your hair and evenly distribute it.",
        "Attach the flat attachment to your hair dryer.",
        "This attachment will look something like a fan, and will force the air out of your dryer in an almost horizontal line.",
        "This should make your hair flat, smooth, and shiny.",
        "Blow dry your hair to about 40% dry.",
        "You don\u2019t want your hair to be completely dry when you\u2019re done with this step since you\u2019ll be applying more heat later.",
        "Dry it just enough so that the dampness is almost taken out of it.",
        "Use a flat paddle brush to dry your hair to about 90% dry.",
        "Brush out a section of hair with your paddle brush.",
        "As you run the brush from root to tip, follow along with your blow dryer.",
        "Your dryer should be almost touching your hair on the brush.",
        "Use a straightener to straighten your hair.",
        "Once your hair is almost completely dry, it should look mostly straight.",
        "However, to get the super straight look Sandy has in Grease, you\u2019ll want to go back over your hair with a straightener.",
        "Using a 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide straightener, section your hair into small sections and run the straightener over each section slowly, moving from root to tip.",
        "Your hair shouldn't be completely dry for this step, since using a straightener on completely dry hair can be damaged by the straightener.",
        "Curl your bangs.",
        "Once most of your hair is finished, you\u2019ll need to curl your bangs.",
        "Use a round brush with a small barrel - less than 2 inches (5 cm) wide.",
        "Place the brush under your bangs, holding it horizontally.",
        "Start at your roots, rolling your blow dryer forward to the tips.",
        "Follow the brush with your hair dryer.",
        "If your bangs have dried out by the time you get to them, rewet them with a spray bottle of water or a wet comb.",
        "Brush your hair.",
        "Using a paddle brush, gently brush your hair out.",
        "You should look like Sandy in no time!",
        "Getting the Greaser Look Spray your hair with a bit a hairspray if it\u2019s clean.",
        "This helps your hair hold the curl.",
        "If you don\u2019t use spray, the curls could pull themselves out and your hair will end up straight.",
        "Section your hair into at least 6 sections.",
        "Start the sections by creating one near your neck.",
        "Use a comb to create a horizontal part near the base of your neck and pile the rest of your hair on top of your head.",
        "The loose hair will be where you start your curls.",
        "The more sections you have in your hair, the curlier it will look.",
        "Spray each section with thermal spray.",
        "Before you curl your hair, spray each section with a heat protectant or thermal spray to protect it from the heat of the curling iron.",
        "It\u2019s best to spray as you go.",
        "If you spray your whole head before you curl your hair, parts of your hair will dry before you get to them, defeating the purpose of using a spray protectant.",
        "Curl the hair around a curling wand.",
        "An 18 mm (0.7 inches) barrel curling wand or iron will give the best size curls for this style.",
        "Starting at the root of your hair nearest the base of your neck, curl your hair around the wand or iron.",
        "You can roll your hair over or under the wand or iron, depending on what feels most comfortable.",
        "Hold the wand or iron as vertical as possible.",
        "Hold your hair there until you feel it heat up.",
        "It should only take 2 or 3 seconds.",
        "Work from the back of your head toward the front.",
        "Coil the curl flat against your head.",
        "Push the curl toward the surface of your head so it lays flat but coiled up.",
        "Secure it with a hair clip so it keeps its shape while you work on the rest of your hair.",
        "Repeat this process until you\u2019ve curled all of your hair.",
        "Release your curls.",
        "Once you\u2019ve finished curling and setting your hair, you can take the clips out.",
        "Unclip each curl and let them fall naturally.",
        "If you want slightly bouncier curls, leave them clipped for about five minutes after you\u2019re finished curling your hair.",
        "Use a comb to tease the roots for volume.",
        "Once you\u2019ve released your curls, use a comb to tease your hair at the roots.",
        "Make sure you only comb down from the root of your hair to the curl.",
        "Use your fingers to brush through your curls.",
        "Once your hair is teased, finger-brushing your curls helps to separate them a bit without causing them to frizz.",
        "Spray your curls with hairspray as you finishing finger-brushing them.",
        "Comb back a small section on the side of your head.",
        "Just like with teasing your roots, you shouldn\u2019t pull the comb all the way through your hair.",
        "Start at about your temple on the left or right side of your head and comb straight back, stopping where your curls begin.",
        "Your hair should lay flat against your head on this side.",
        "Insert a hair comb.",
        "Starting a few inches (5 to 6 cm) away from your roots, insert a hair comb into your hair, pushing it forward toward your temple.",
        "Give a final spritz of hairspray.",
        "Once your hair is set, give it another couple of squirts of hairspray to set it."
