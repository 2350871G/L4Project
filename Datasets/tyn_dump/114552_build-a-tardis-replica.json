Also consider that a full-sized replica will be incredibly heavy, so you'll want to build it in place. For this article, the measurement used is referred to simply as \"units\" rather than inches or meters. For example, instead of 1 inch or 1 cm, the article uses the abbreviation 1u. This will be the basis for all the relative dimensions you will need to calculate the final sizes. If your TARDIS is to be 4 cm square, then everything is multiplied by 4. For example, say that the vertical posts on each corner are 2u high by .1u square. Multiply everything by 4, and the final dimensions will be 8cm x .4cm x .4cm."

For this article, the measurement used is referred to simply as \"units\" rather than inches or meters. For example, instead of 1 inch or 1 cm, the article uses the abbreviation 1u. This will be the basis for all the relative dimensions you will need to calculate the final sizes. If your TARDIS is to be 4 cm square, then everything is multiplied by 4. For example, say that the vertical posts on each corner are 2u high by .1u square. Multiply everything by 4, and the final dimensions will be 8cm x .4cm x .4cm. Gather your materials. Refer to the Things You'll Need List below, and have all the pieces cut to size and ready build before you start. For the balance of this article, it is assumed that you're building a scale replica. If you wish to build the full-sized version, be sure to build securely, using screws and braces as necessary. Building the Frame Start with the base. Lay it down on a flat surface. If it\u2019s small enough to be moved when the TARDIS is finished, lay it on a sheet of paper or other protective material. If it\u2019s going to stay where you build it, make sure the ground is level and not subject to moisture. Lay down a tarp if necessary. Base = 1u square x .2u high. Add the corner posts and the ceiling. This will be the framework for everything that follows, so build this part carefully. Mark the corners. With a pencil, mark the inside top of the base around all 4 corners at .05u. For example, if your base is 4 cm square, make a mark at .2 cm. (4 x .05 = .2) Connect the dots. Draw a line between the center points of your marks with pencil as a guide for placing the other parts of the TARDIS build. Attach the posts. Glue the posts to the base so that they sit inside the guidelines, as shown. Attach the ceiling. Place the ceiling board on top of the corner posts, aligned so that the edges are flush. Allow the TARDIS frame time to dry and let the glue set.  Building the Roof Build the outer roof frame. Take the 4 outer roof pieces, and glue them together to form a picture-frame-like box. Build the inner roof frame. Using the 4 inner roof pieces, glue them together to form a box that will fit inside the outer roof frame. If there are small gaps, don\u2019t worry\u2013\u2013those can be taken care of with filler before painting. Attach the frame. Center the frame structure on top of the roof, and mark the location. Apply glue to the bottom of the frame, and attach. Add the 4 support blocks on the inside corners of the frame, as shown. Attach the top. Apply glue to the support blocks, and set the roof top in place. It should be flush with the top of the frames. Alternate roof assembly: Replace the frames with solid pieces. Instead of an outer frame and an inner frame plus support blocks, center and attach one .7u square x .1u high piece, then top it with a .6u square x .1u high piece. Add a roof cap for the lantern. Center and glue this block to the top of the roof assembly. Allow to dry. Make sure the entire roof assembly is squared, and let dry. Add a lantern.  Building the Sides Attach between the posts. For all sides but the door side, center the side panels horizontally between the posts. Glue these in place on the bottom and sides, and let dry. If they are too tight, trim a little off one side until they fit snugly. If too loose, add a small frame inside each side of the posts, then attach the side panel to that frame. Add the windows. Attach two window panels on each non-door side. They should fit snugly between the top of the side panels and the roof. Add vertical trim. Attach the long vertical strip in the center of the side panel on all 3 sides, and allow to dry. Add horizontal trim. Starting at .05u from the bottom of the side panel, make a mark every .5u. Do this on each side of the vertical trim piece, and on the edges of the side panels. Attach a horizontal trim piece at each point, as shown. Adding the Door Build the stationary side. Attach the left door panel, centered on the left vertical post. Glue it to the post and to the base, and make sure it is straight across the bottom. Allow to dry. Attach the hinges. The TARDIS opens inward, so attach the hinges to the inside of the right door panel. Center the door panel on the right vertical post, then attach the hinges to that post. Test to make sure it opens smoothly. Add the windows. Attach one window panels to the left door panel, gluing it in place on the panel, the post, and the ceiling. For the swinging door panel, glue only the bottom of the window. Add the vertical trim. Attach the long vertical strip to the left door panel so that the right edge of the strip is flush with the right edge of the door panel. Attach the long vertical strip to the right door panel so that the left edge of the strip is flush with the left edge of the door. Add horizontal trim. Starting at .05u from the bottom of the door panel, make a mark every .5u. Do this on each side of the vertical trim pieces, and on the outer edges of the door panels. Attach a horizontal trim piece at each point, as was done with the side trim. Let everything set and dry thoroughly.  Finish your TARDIS Add personal touches, Now that you are done, you will want to personalize it. Start by painting it a deep gray-blue. Here\u2019s a color chip you can use as a reference. The BBC approved Tardis blue is actually Pantone 2955C. Be sure to mask off the windows, unless you want them blue too! Add a handle. When the paint has dried, add a door handle. You can also add a magnetic latch to secure the door, or a stop on base and roof so that it can\u2019t be pulled outward. Finish the inside. Gold paint would be a good choice. Add signage. Add a panel across the top that says Police Public Call Box on the outside edges of the ceiling. It is white lettering on a black background. The panel on the front of the TARDIS reads as follows: You are now the proud owner of a TARDIS. Safe travels!",
