Dump the hot, ashy briquettes in the center of the grill grate. Rub a little vegetable or canola oil on the grate to prevent the fish from sticking. Season the opah with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Set 2 opah fillets (\u20444 pound (340 g) total) on a plate and season the fish on both sides with 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) of olive oil. Sprinkle both sides of the fish with salt and pepper to taste. Toss the asparagus with olive oil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Put 1 pound (450 g) of trimmed asparagus in a long dish.

Serve the fish with freshly squeezed lemon juice and steamed rice. Store the leftover fish in an airtight container for 3 to 4 days. Making Grilled Opah Fish Tacos Light a charcoal grill or turn a gas grill to high. To heat the charcoal grill, fill a chimney with briquettes and light them. Dump the hot, ashy briquettes in the center of the grill grate and lightly oil the grate. This will prevent the fish from sticking to it. Season the opah with canola oil, salt, and lemon pepper seasoning. Use your fingers or a pastry brush to coat 1 pound (450 g) of opah steaks with 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL) of canola oil. Sprinkle each side of the fish steaks with Hawaiian black lava sea salt and lemon pepper seasoning to taste. Grill the opah for 4 to 5 minutes. Lay the seasoned fish steaks on the greased grill grate. Cook the opah for 4 to 5 minutes, so the bottom browns a little. Flip and grill the opah for 4 to 5 more minutes. Use tongs to flip each opah steak over. Cook the opah until the outsides are cooked and the centers are medium. The fish will flake if you scrape the center with a fork. If you want the fish medium-well, grill it for 2 to 3 more minutes. For medium-rare, reduce the cooking time by 2 minutes. Remove and serve the grilled opah.

Let your guests assemble their own opah tacos. Refrigerate the leftover opah in an airtight container for 3 to 4 days. Making Blackened Opah on the Grill Combine the blackening seasoning in a small bowl. Mix together 2 teaspoons (11 g) of sea salt, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of fresh cracked pepper, 1 1/2 teaspoons (3 g) of paprika, 1 tablespoon (6 g) of dried thyme, and 1 teaspoon (2 g) of cayenne. Brush the opah with butter or oil and rub the blackening seasoning over it. Lay 1 to 2 pieces of opah on a plate and brush 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL) of melted butter or olive oil over the fish. Spread the blackening seasoning evenly over the fish. Use your fingers to rub the seasoning into the fish and set it aside while you heat the grill. Heat a gas or charcoal grill. Turn a gas grill to high or heat a full chimney of briquettes. Once the briquettes are hot and lightly covered in ash, dump them in the center of the grill grate. Brush a little canola or vegetable oil on the grate to prevent the fish from sticking to it. Grill the opah for 5 minutes. Lay the seasoned opah on the grill so it's directly over the briquettes or the hottest part of the grill. Cook the opah for 5 minutes so it blackens on the bottom. Flip and grill the opah for 3 to 5 more minutes. Use tongs to flip the fish over and grill it until it's cooked on the outside.
