Excess, pronounced, and never-ending stress typical of our modern way of living, however, kills brains cells and ages your brain faster. To decrease your brain age, reduce your exposure to and intolerance of stress by finding ways that minimize it, ways that work for you. Some ideas include:\n\nMeditating. Meditation is one of the more effective methods for reducing stress in your life and it can be done at home, at work and even while traveling. Taking up a physical activity that releases stress, such as yoga, martial arts, kickboxing or tennis. Learning to be more assertive and to express yourself. Assertive people are better able to state their needs and wants politely but firmly. Expressing yourself clearly and refusing to allow yourself to be used or swayed by others is a good way of keeping stress at bay. Exercising more. Exercise wards off the effects of stress by burning off the stress hormones and chasing away the cortisol that destroys brain cells. Mood improves with exercise too, as noradrenaline is secreted and endorphins enter the bloodstream. These substances give you a lift and help to ward off depression."

A positive outlook that allows you to maintain a belief in your value and self-worth will allow you to live a fulfilled life in which your brain remains open to new possibilities. On the other hand, constant negative thinking can easily shut you off from continued learning and growth, which will cause your brain to age faster. Learn to control negative thinking. The first step is to recognize negative thoughts. The second step is to change the thoughts to something more realistic and positive. Changing negative thinking is the same as changing any other bad habit. The more you practice positive thinking, the more your brain will respond. Work on your emotional intelligence. When you have emotional intelligence, you can recognize your emotions, reason with them and use them to enhance thought. You will be more creative, make better decisions and implement positive solutions to problems. The better you get at mastering your own emotions, the better you'll become at enabling constructive emotions in others as well, which will create more fruitful connections in your life. Reframe the Past in your mind. While you cannot change the past, you can change your attitude toward it and avoid slipping into a victim mentality. Re-examine events that brought you shame, guilt, humiliation, sadness and fear so that you can let them go and move forward. You'll decrease your brain age with a better attitude because you'll remove useless, energy-sapping thoughts and replace them with healthier, forward-looking and self-forgiving thoughts that will energize you."

Aim to think mostly of words relating to youth, vitality, energy, and pep whenever you consider your own age. Seek to see yourself as younger than your biological age.

Decrease Your Brain's Age With Good Mental Health Practices Cope with stress. Stress is good for you in small doses because it keeps you on your toes and it helps to remind you that you're alive and need to be careful in certain situations. Excess, pronounced, and never-ending stress typical of our modern way of living, however, kills brains cells and ages your brain faster. To decrease your brain age, reduce your exposure to and intolerance of stress by finding ways that minimize it, ways that work for you. Some ideas include:\n\nMeditating. Meditation is one of the more effective methods for reducing stress in your life and it can be done at home, at work and even while traveling. Taking up a physical activity that releases stress, such as yoga, martial arts, kickboxing or tennis. Learning to be more assertive and to express yourself. Assertive people are better able to state their needs and wants politely but firmly. Expressing yourself clearly and refusing to allow yourself to be used or swayed by others is a good way of keeping stress at bay. Exercising more. Exercise wards off the effects of stress by burning off the stress hormones and chasing away the cortisol that destroys brain cells. Mood improves with exercise too, as noradrenaline is secreted and endorphins enter the bloodstream. These substances give you a lift and help to ward off depression. Improve your attitude. Your attitude affects brain activity and influences your mood and emotional state. A positive outlook that allows you to maintain a belief in your value and self-worth will allow you to live a fulfilled life in which your brain remains open to new possibilities. On the other hand, constant negative thinking can easily shut you off from continued learning and growth, which will cause your brain to age faster. Learn to control negative thinking. The first step is to recognize negative thoughts. The second step is to change the thoughts to something more realistic and positive. Changing negative thinking is the same as changing any other bad habit. The more you practice positive thinking, the more your brain will respond. Work on your emotional intelligence. When you have emotional intelligence, you can recognize your emotions, reason with them and use them to enhance thought. You will be more creative, make better decisions and implement positive solutions to problems. The better you get at mastering your own emotions, the better you'll become at enabling constructive emotions in others as well, which will create more fruitful connections in your life. Reframe the Past in your mind. While you cannot change the past, you can change your attitude toward it and avoid slipping into a victim mentality. Re-examine events that brought you shame, guilt, humiliation, sadness and fear so that you can let them go and move forward. You'll decrease your brain age with a better attitude because you'll remove useless, energy-sapping thoughts and replace them with healthier, forward-looking and self-forgiving thoughts that will energize you. Do What You Love. People who love what they're doing in life tend to experience a greater sense of purpose and happiness. You may not be in your dream job, activity or relationship, but you can find things to be grateful for in the life you're leading. Mix up work tasks every day and pursue plenty of other activities to add playfulness, interest and fun into your life. Give mental exercises 100 percent of your effort. When undertaking mental workouts, be sure to focus and concentrate properly. You won't get benefits from simply going through the motions \u2013 you must really throw yourself into doing the mental workout activities with full attention.

Whatever your beliefs or lack of them, nurturing your spiritual self or connecting to the awe and wonder of life is an important aspect of keeping your brain young. Our brains are wired for spiritual experiences, such as times that we take a holistic approach to our place in the world and seek complete well-being and a sense of purpose. Practice prayer, meditation, reflection, taking time out or whatever allows you to focus on your spiritual self. This will give your brain the space to make connections and to seek \"the flow\" of life in which heart, mind, and body all work as one. Nurturing your spiritual self increases your compassion for both yourself and for others, allowing you to connect better with others and thereby enhance your brain functioning.

Hang a map of the world inside a purple frame. Stick purple stick-pins into the places around the world that you'd like to visit or revisit. Be a social butterfly and build social support networks. A lonely brain tends to age faster and while you don't need to be the life and soul of the party, you do need the lift that regular connection with other people can provide you. Don't just hang people of your own age group, especially if you're older. People tend to think similarly to those they spend time with and \"feeling old\" is catching\nOlder people tend to prefer to be around people they're most familiar with while younger people tend to enjoy meeting new people and getting to know a wider variety of people. If you're going to keep your brain younger, think young by mixing up your social contacts and spending time with people in all age groups. Go back in time. Thinking about your youth, and of memories you had when you were young, can keep your brain young. In 1979, a Harvard psychology professor Ellen Langer created an experiment in which elderly people were sent to live in a house set up as if it were 1959, 20 years earlier. They had to watch 1950s TV, wear clothing from the era and act as if they were living in the '50s. Those who participated in the study displayed improved recall, intelligence and even eyesight. They even appeared younger when before and after photos of them were compared. A study by John Bargh showed that people who thought about words related to aging slowed down after they did the test. Aim to think mostly of words relating to youth, vitality, energy, and pep whenever you consider your own age. Seek to see yourself as younger than your biological age. How you think about your age is as important as what you eat and how much you exercise. Much aging is in the mind. If you live and think like a younger person and your brain will definitely cooperate. Avoid multi-tasking. Multi-tasking reduces your brain's effectiveness and can cause you stress. Instead, complete single tasks with greater focus. Reduce the time you spend watching TV. Instead, choose pastimes that are more interactive and require brain input. Only use TV viewing as an occasional treat.",
