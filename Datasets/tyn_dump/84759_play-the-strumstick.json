The Grand to D, A, D. Now, don't worry if you don't know how to read music. The best way is to buy a cheap electric tuner. The tuner will hear what key a single string is tuned to, and will have a read-out of where you are on the scale. It's just a matter of plucking the top string, and loosening or tightening the string to get the right key. In the case of the Basic strumstick, that would be G. Now, pluck the middle string, and tune it to the key of D, and so on to the bottom string, to the key of G again. There is a way to tune your Strumstick manually; which I will provide a link too at the end of this article."
