For example, a birthday party invitation may be done in the honoree's favorite colors or be related to the theme of the event (bright colors for a \"Mexican Fiesta\" theme, red and blue for a Spiderman theme or black and white for a formal wedding.) If you're sending invitations on behalf of someone else, be sure to consult with them about color preferences. The number of colors you use may impact the final cost of your invites. Purchasing paper in multiple colors or designs or printing in colored ink vs. black can add a bit to your cost, so keep that in mind."

Make a visit to your local stationary or art supply store to look at options and contact or visit the website of the delivery service in your area. Envelopes. The most common style of envelopes are A-style (also called A-line)  They have side seams and square, sometimes deep flaps. They come in a range of sizes and their numeric designation corresponds to set  dimensions. For example, A1 envelopes are 5.125' x 3.625' while the larger A-8 are 8.125' x 5.5'. You can do some research online about envelope sizes. Be sure to make note of the size of the invite that will fit into the envelope you choose. Mailing costs. Mailing regulations vary from country to country, so you want to check with the service you'll use about the specific regulations that govern cost. For example, the United States Postal Service (USPS) requires that letters not exceed 11 1/2\" long x 6 1/8\" high or be more than 1/4\" thick.Envelopes that are square or another unusual shapes incur an additional mailing cost because their size makes it difficult for them to be processed on mail sorting machines. Before you decide to get clever with addressing your invites, know, too, that envelopes on which the address is written parallel to the shorter edge cost more to mail."

This kind of paper is most readily available in solid colors. Chose one or more coordinating papers to glue to your first backing sheet.

Measure your paper carefully and cut it using a paper trimmer or scissors. A paper trimmer will help ensure straight, even cuts, but as long as you take your time and are careful, you can do as good a job with a pair of scissors.

Inserts could include directions and/or a map; if this is a wedding invitation, they could also be a reception card, information about local accommodations or an RSVP card and envelope. Plan to stagger the height of your inserts. You can go with what looks good to your eye or standardize the height of your inserts, perhaps making each one 1 1/2\" shorter the one behind it in the pocket. Whatever you decide about the height of your inserts, be sure to give each one a title that'll show when the invitation is open.

        "The longer \"flap\" of paper that's left on the right-hand side will fold up to become your pocket.",
        "Fold across.",
        "With your paper back in place in front of you and the cut-out space in the bottom left-hand corner, you'll work from left to right to make your folds.",
        "Measure in 2\" from the left and create a vertical fold.",
        "Measure 5\" from that fold (7\" from the left-hand edge of the paper) and create a second fold.",
        "Use a paper scorer or folding bone to create sharp folds in your paper.",
        "Fold up.",
        "Measure up an 1 1/2\" from the bottom edge of the long \"flap\" of paper on the right-hand side and fold to create your pocket.",
        "Glue the pocket into place.",
        "Create the invitation text.",
        "Use your computer and home printer to print out the text of your invitation.",
        "The final, cut size of your text should be 4 3/4\" wide x 6 3/8\" tall.",
        "If you find it easier, you can print \"corner guides\" around your text box to give you the proper dimensions and help you cut your paper to the proper size.",
        "Use a glue stick to glue the invitation text to the middle panel of your pocket fold.",
        "Create your inserts.",
        "Print out the text for the inserts that will sit in the pocket of your invitation and cut them to size.",
        "A simple guideline is to make the inserts just a little smaller than the pocket.",
        "In this case, make them just under 4\" wide and a little less than 6 1/2\" tall.",
        "Inserts could include directions and/or a map; if this is a wedding invitation, they could also be a reception card, information about local accommodations or an RSVP card and envelope.",
        "Plan to stagger the height of your inserts.",
        "You can go with what looks good to your eye or standardize the height of your inserts, perhaps making each one 1 1/2\" shorter the one behind it in the pocket.",
        "Whatever you decide about the height of your inserts, be sure to give each one a title that'll show when the invitation is open.",
        "Place the copy for each insert so that it falls below the edge of the insert that gets layer on top of it.",
        "In that way, the overall look of the invitation won't be cluttered, and readers can simply pull each insert out of the pocket in order to read the information.",
        "Assemble your invitation.",
        "Place the inserts in the pocket; the tallest goes in first and each progressively shorter insert is placed in until the pocket is full.",
        "Fold and tie.",
        "Fold the right-hand pocket side of your invitation closed and then fold the left-hand flap over.",
        "Tie a piece of decorative ribbon around the invite to hold it closed."
