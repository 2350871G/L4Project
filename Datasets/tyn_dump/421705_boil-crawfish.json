Most of the weight will get discarded since crawfish come with their shells on. Source the crawfish from seafood and grocery stores or crawfish trucks, which sell crawfish when it's in season. If you don't have a source of crawfish in your area, purchase it online from a vendor such as Louisiana Crawfish co., which will ship the crawfish to you live. When you take home your crawfish or receive your shipment make sure you keep them cool, away from light and heat, so they're fresh when it's time to cook them. Boiled crawfish that have been frozen do not taste nearly as good as live boiled crawfish."
