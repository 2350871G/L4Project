If you need more than what just the certain seat gave you on space, you can fold down just the rear seat. If you need even more, you can fold down both. Push the front seats up (unless you are doing the back seat).  Middle Seats Pull the carpet that is in front of the seat upwards with both of your hands, and place it to the side. It's preferable to place these carpets outside the vehicle when you do so, but after a few times, you'll be able to determine just how much space you'll need to use to be able to find a place to put these. Pulling up the carpeting, will expose the cabinets that will later hold your seats. Ensure that both headrests are down. If there is a lever or pull-cord to fold these headrests down, pull it until the headrest have been completely folded down. You may have to push the headrest into it's closing position. Pull the lever that folds the middle seat's seat-back into a folded position. The lever is on the side of the seat. Take notice of the knob on the floor slightly underneath the seat. It should be just noticeable to the untrained eye. Push on the cabinet-door from the back, and hold it back. Doing this will expose an area that is able to accompany the seat. Pull backwards on the knob. This should free the seats from their locked and upright position. It will also cause the seat to fall frontwards slightly. Push on the back of the seat.

Rear Seats Open the trunk lid using either the key fob's button  or the button located inside the vehicle near the dashboard.  Walk around to the back of the trunk.  Clear out the trunk, as the seat will stow into this section.  Look for and pull on cord number 1. There should be one marked with this style number. It may either start to fold the headrest down, or it may fold the remainder of the seat onto the seating portion of the seat. This cord will be hidden and over to the side. Push on the portion of the seat that will begin to fold down when you pull cord number 1. Pull on cord number 2. It will either fold the remainder of the seat onto the seating position, or it will allow you to begin to stow the seat away (depending on model year and brand). Pull on cord number 3, to slow the rate of speed the rear seats fold down flat at. Release this cord slowly thereafter. Drop cord number 2 and pull on cord number 3 asynchronously, to pull the seat into it's final resting position. Repeat these steps to the other section of seats in the rear of the car. ",
