Cut a 4 inch (10 cm) sprig about \u00bd inch (1 cm) above a junction to allow new branches to grow in its place. The sprig does not need to have many leaves, and almost any sprig will do. Place the sprig in a glass of water, and remove any leaves that fall below the water line. Within a week, small white roots should appear under water. Wait a few more days to another week to allow the roots to develop into a decent length. Add water to the glass as necessary. Make sure that you change the water every four to five days to prevent rot."

Mint spreads rapidly, and its roots have a tendency to choke out the roots of other plants. As a result, it is often best to plant mint in a container without other plants. Use a 12-to-16-inch wide pot for one plant. You should add a water-retaining polymer to the potting soil so that it stays moist and doesn't dry up.
