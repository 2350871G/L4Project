There are also nonprofit bee removal services that keep bees from becoming endangered in high-risk areas where their pollination skills are especially important. Tip: This is the absolute best way to have bees removed. Beekeepers won\u2019t harm the bugs and will relocate them to a safe environment. You normally won\u2019t need to pay a beekeeper to remove a hive. If you do, the fee won\u2019t be particularly high, although it depends on where you live."

You will have to pay to have the bees removed, but a bee removal service will remove the bees safely and thoroughly. Bee removal experts often sell or give away their hives and will not kill the bees unless absolutely necessary. If the hive is easily accessed and the swarm isn\u2019t particularly big, bee removal will cost $75-200. If drywall needs to be removed or the hive is in a tricky location, like a roof, it may cost up to $1,500."

Make sure that you hire an exterminator with experience removing bees. If a large number of bees die and their corpses are not removed, they will break down and leave a particularly funky odor behind that will take some time to get rid of."

Bees have hair and tend to be rounder, while wasps and hornets have smooth exteriors and tend to have pointer thoraxes. You should also inspect the nest if you see one. Honey bees build their nests out of wax, whereas other stinging insects tend to construct their nests out of wood fiber or mud. Warning: If you have an allergy to bees, do not get close to inspect them and do not attempt to extract them without professional help. Between the beekeeper\u2019s outfit, the tools you\u2019ll need, and the vacuum, expect to spend $100-300 on a DIY removal. It might be cheaper to hire a professional, and it's definitely safer for both you and the bees. It's important to make sure that you\u2019re not dealing with wasps or hornets. Bees are valuable pollinators and are not aggressive or dangerous (unless someone in your family has an allergy), so killing them should be avoided whenever possible. Many hornets and wasps are extremely aggressive, so do not get closer if you suspect it isn\u2019t a bee."

The amount of cinnamon you use depends on the size of your garden, but you\u2019ll probably go through at least 1 container a day for a standard-sized home. Do this for 1-2 weeks to let nearby bees know this isn\u2019t a good area for pollination, and the bees will stop coming back to your garden.Warning: This may not work if it rains during the 1-2 weeks that you\u2019re doing this. Wait for an extended period of dry weather to do this. You don\u2019t need to work the cinnamon into the soil. It\u2019s fine to simply let it rest on top of plants and dirt. Wash your ledges with soapy water and mint to keep bees from nesting. Get a ladder, bucket, and sponge. Fill the bucket halfway with water and add 1-2 squirts of dish soap. Then, sprinkle a handful of mint leaves into the water. Enlist a friend to hold the ladder for you. Wash the ledges of your roof with the minty-soap to keep bees away. If your roof is flat, pour the remaining soap and water on your roof and spread it around with a broom or large sponge.This will keep bees from setting up a colony in your chimney, roof, or garden. The odor from the mint and soap will linger for a while, and the bees that seem to be frequenting your home will look for somewhere else to set up shop. Leave the bees alone if they aren\u2019t a bother and there\u2019s no hive. If you look thoroughly and can\u2019t find a hive, it\u2019s possible that the colony doesn\u2019t live nearby. If this is the case, you can probably leave the bees alone since they\u2019re only in your garden for the pollen. Bees are incredibly good for the environment, and if you don\u2019t need to destroy or remove the hive, simply leave it be.If you live in an area where the temperature gets below 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C) during the winter months, the hive may leave on their own. You may be able to simply wait them out.",

        "This is really the only way to safely remove bees without killing them if you\u2019re unexperienced in bee removal.There is a way to remove a colony naturally using a wire cone and an empty box, but this process takes 3-4 months and requires an extensive knowledge of hive behavior.",
