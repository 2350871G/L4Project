Using a primer that treats acne also helps the acne while giving your face a smoother look. Apply a small amount evenly across your face. Using too much can make your foundation appear uneven, which is the opposite effect of what you want when you're trying to cover a blackhead. Make sure that you wait a minute to let the primer dry before applying any other makeup. You can use a tinted primer to improve your facial color."

It is important to apply treatment concealers before foundation so that your skin can receive the treatment within the concealer. To apply, dab the concealer on top of the blemish. Pat, don't rub, to remove excess concealer. Ideally, you'll need a concealer that is similar to your skin color. Depending on your skin tone and the color of the spot (if it is dark or inflamed and red), you can use a color-correcting concealer. For instance, red helps to hide redness on your face, while pink to orangish-pink concealer can help conceal dark spots and marks on your face (pink for lighter skin tones and orangish-pink for darker skin tones). Treatment concealers often come in color correcting shades."
