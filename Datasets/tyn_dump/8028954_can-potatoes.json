Cut a potato chunk in half and check that it is hot in the center before removing the pot from the heat and draining out the water. Filling the Jars Place the empty jars in a pot of water and bring it to a boil, then remove it from heat. Place your jars in a large pot with about 3 inches (7.6 cm) of hot water. Place the pot on a stovetop burner, set it to high heat, and leave it to boil. Once the water is boiling, remove the pot from the heat.

Pressure-Cooking the Jars of Potatoes Fill the pressure canner with 3 qt (2.8 L) of water and set it to warm. Place the water into the bottom of the canner. Set the temperature to warm. If the water starts boiling, turn it down. Check the instructions on the side of your canner to verify that this is an appropriate amount of water for your canner, as it may vary between brands. Place the packed jars onto the pressure canner rack. It is important to use the rack as the jars shouldn\u2019t touch the bottom of the canner. Spread the jars out on the rack. Make that sure that they aren\u2019t touching each other as the steam needs to be able to travel between the jars to cook the potatoes. Use tongs to move the jars around on the rack. Heat the jars for the time suggested on the side of your pressure canner. It is important for your safety, and the proper canning of the potatoes, to follow the unique instructions on your cooker as most brands have different settings. Most canners will require 35-40 minutes of cooking time. Remove the cans and allow them to cool overnight. After the time specified on the pressure canner, carefully remove the cans using tongs. Place the cans on a heat-proof surface, such as a wooden chopping board, to cool. Check that the tops of the lids don\u2019t bounce back when pressed. Once the cans have cooled, press down on the top of each lid. If the lid pops back up, it shows that the jar did not seal correctly.
