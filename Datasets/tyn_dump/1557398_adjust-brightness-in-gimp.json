Moving the slider to the left makes the layer darker, while moving it to the right makes the layer lighter. Note that this transformation will occur uniformly, which means that it will increase or decrease the brightness of each pixel by the same magnitude. For example, if you increase the brightness of a layer that is too dark overall, the finished image will likely have a washed-out appearance. This is because the brightness slider turns the layer's darkest tones (like black) into medium tones, and so the overall contrast has been reduced. To adjust brightness in a non-uniform manner, you should use the \"Curves\" menu instead. This will allow you to adjust brightness while preserving the layer's tonal variety."
