Allow each coat to dry before applying the next one. Keep the stencil in place until you apply your last coat of paint. You can apply the stencils to an unpainted pot or to a painted one. If you are applying the stencils to a bare pot, be sure to wipe it down with a damp cloth first. If you are adding house numbers, aim to make them about 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) tall and 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) wide. This will make them more visible from the street."

Assembling the Planter Place the large terra cotta pot on a matching terra cotta tray. It would be a good idea to add 3 to 4 spacers under the pot so that it doesn't actually touch the tray. \u00bd-inch (1.27-centimeter) thick pieces of wood work great. Place a screen into the bottom of the pot. This will help prevent the soil from falling through the drainage soil. If you can't find any window screening, you can use a lid from a plastic Tupperware container and poke lots of tiny holes into it. Fill the bottom of the pot with some soil. This will be your base layer. You only need 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of soil. Place the medium plastic pot upside down into the terra cotta pot. The bottom of the plastic pot is now the top. Make sure that it is below the rim of the terra cotta pot. If the plastic pot is too far below the rim, take it out, add more soil, then put it back in. Gently press it into the soil to create a seal. Add your second tier. Place the medium-sized terra cotta pot on top of the plastic one, right-side-up. Insert another plastic screening into the bottom, then a thin layer of dirt. Place the second plastic pot upside-down into it, and make sure that it is below the rim. Finish the last tier. Place the small terra cotta pot on top, right-side-up. Insert a piece of window screening into the bottom. You do not need to add another plastic pot into it, unless you wish to save soil. Adding the Plants Choose your plants. Flowers and herbs are popular choices for these types of planters. You can also use trailing filler plants, strawberries, vegetables, or even succulents. You can buy young plants from your local nursery or gardening shop, or you can try to start them from seed. Dampen the soil, if necessary. The soil should feel damp and springy, like a sponge. If your soil is too dry, mix some water into it. Make sure that your soil is suitable for the type of plants you are using. Fill the gaps between the pots with soil.
