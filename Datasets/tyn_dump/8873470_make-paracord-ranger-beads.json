Weave it back down through the first loop. You will now have three loops. Push the end of the cord back down through the third loop. You will now have four loops with a hole in the center. Thread the cord up through the center hole. Pull the end of the cord upward so that it is parallel to the edge of the second loop. Twist and adjust the looped cord until you have a ring shape. Assembling the Counter Fold a second cord in half. Cut 30-inch (76.2-centimeter) length of paracord in a contrasting color. If you can, try to use 550 paracord. Slide the second cord through the ring you just made. Make sure that you are pushing it through the folded end first. Stop when you have about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) sticking out of the top of the ring. Tighten the bead. Gently tug on both ends of the bead's cord.
