The sharper the blade of the pruners or garden scissors, the easier it will be to trim the stem without squeezing it too hard. A pair of shears or scissors with a smaller head are best for reaching into thick bushes. As opposed to flat blades, curved blades tend to make the cleanest cuts. Some pairs of scissors and shears have a \u201ccut and hold\u201d feature that holds onto the stems when they\u2019re cut so they don\u2019t fall to the ground.
