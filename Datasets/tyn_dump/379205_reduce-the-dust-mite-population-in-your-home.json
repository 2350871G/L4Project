High water temperature can kill dust mites better than just using detergent. Also wash curtains. Set your washing machine to its hottest setting. If the water isn't hot enough, check your hot water heater. Most hot water heaters have an adjustable knob to change the maximum temperature. If you can't wash bedding in hot enough temperatures, throw them in the dryer for at least 15 minutes at a temperature above 130 \u00b0F to kill mites. Afterward, wash and dry the bedding so allergens are removed. You could also dry items in direct sunlight. Use a product that contains essential oils, like eucalyptus, cedar or tea tree oil to add to the wash's effectiveness. Using detergent plus bleach will remove most allergens and a significant amount of dust mites, even in cold or warm water. Items can be washed again to reduce mite levels further. Know that live mites can be transferred from mite-infested items to mite-free items during washing. Hot tumble dry items for an extra half an hour after drying or dry clean items to kill dust mites. This will not get rid of the allergen dust mites produce, however."

Stay away from the vacuumed room for about two hours to let everything settle. Keep your vacuum serviced so that it continues to work well. Use a water vacuum to keep mites inside the water container so you can dump the water into your toilet and flush it. You may wish to wear a mask when you vacuum to avoid inhaling allergens.

        "Get plastic toys or washable stuffed toys instead.",
        "If you choose washable stuffed toys, wash them often in hot water and dry thoroughly.",
        "Keep stuffed toys off beds.",
        "Put any non-washable stuff toys that you keep in the freezer every couple of weeks to kill living dust mites.",
        "Try not to sleep on your couch.",
        "This can attract more dust mites to the area by providing ample food in the form of your dead skin cells.",
        "Couches tend to be more difficult to protect from dust mites than beds.",
        "It is better to sleep in a bed with a dust mite cover for protection from allergens and mites.",
        "Leave your bed unmade.",
        "That's right, now you have a legitimate reason not to make your bed every day!",
        "Leaving the bed unmade each morning with the sheets exposed to air will air-dry and release moisture from bedding.",
        "This significantly reduces the number of dust mites you have to contend with.",
        "Using Other Methods Ventilate your home.",
        "Open windows and screen doors to allow fresh air to circulate.",
        "This reduces humidity and can help move dust and other allergens out.",
        "Do this often to reduce dust mite populations.",
        "Use direct sunlight.",
        "Sunlight kills dust mites, but keep in mind that it does not remove dust mite residue.",
        "Hang bedding, clothing and other furnishings outside or in direct sunlight.",
        "Air blankets, rugs and other heavy bedding items outside as often as possible.",
        "Open curtains and blinds to let the sun shine in.",
        "Reduce clutter.",
        "Excess items in the bedroom such as books, magazines, clothing baskets, knickknacks, ornaments, toys and piles of clothing that make it hard to clean or dust create an excellent home for dust mites.",
        "A good rule of thumb to follow is that if it can collect dust, it can be a haven for dust mites.",
        "Try making a mimimalist bedroom.",
        "Reduce humidity.",
        "Dust mites thrive in humid environments because they absorb water from the atmosphere.",
        "Avoid humidifying, and use a dehumidifier or air conditioner to keep relative humidity below 50%.",
        "A hygrometer, available at hardware stores, measures humidity levels in the home so you can have more control.",
        "Control temperatures.",
        "Dust mites do very well in temperatures between 65\u00b0F and 84\u00b0F and a relative humidity of more than 50%.",
        "To cut down on dust mite populations, make your home less comfortable for them.",
        "Along with a reduction in humidity, consider lowering your in-home temperatures to below 70\u00b0F or more.",
        "Install a filter.",
        "A high-efficiency media filter in your furnace and air conditioning unit can help remove allergens and reduce dust mite populations.",
        "Look for a filter with a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) of 11 or 12 and change the filer every three months at least.",
        "Leave the fan on for a whole house air filter.",
        "Use an air purifier.",
        "There are many types of air purifiers that can be attached to the central air return.",
        "These purifiers decrease irritants and food sources for dust mites with most filters removing 50 to 70% of material.",
        "HEPA filters, however, will remove up to 99% of dust mite feces, dust, animal dander, pollen, cockroach feces, and other materials.",
        "Freeze items.",
        "Non-washable bedding, toys, furnishings and other items can be frozen to kill dust mites.",
        "Freeze these items for 24 to 48 hours.",
        "Though this method will destroy mites, it does not remove allergens."
