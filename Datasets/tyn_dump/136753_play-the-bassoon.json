Even the lower cost bassoons are thousands of dollars, so many students start on school-owned instruments. A bassoon uses a double reed \u2013 two pieces of bamboo tied together that vibrate when blown into. The reeds cost about $10-15 each, and you should keep a supply of at least three to four quality reeds on hand. Reeds can break easily. If you care for them well and handle them gently, a good reed can last about a month. If you take a reed out carelessly, it can chip before you ever get the chance to use it. You want to make sure that you keep your reeds inside a special bassoon reed case so that they can be protected from being bumped but still dry out. Also when you use a reed it's good to alternate between 2-3 reeds so that they have time to dry out before their next use. Bassoons come in wood or plastic material. You may be able to achieve a warmer tone with a wood bassoon. Plastic versions tend to be less expensive."

You can save money by making your own reeds, but it is a time-consuming process. Your reeds should not have cracks in them. All of the wires should be intact.

Having a hand rest is optional, however you may need one depending on the length of your hand. If you're going to use a neck strap, you will need some type of hand support. Select a hand rest with a size and shape that is comfortable for you. Get cork grease or paraffin wax. The tenons of your bassoon will need to be lubricated. Get paraffin canning wax if you have thread wrapped tenons. If you have corked tenons, get cork grease. Pen or pencil. Always have a pen or pencil with your music supplies. You will want to mark your music as needed. For example, you can mark upside-down arrows at the points where you should breathe in. Setting up Your Instrument Make sure the bassoon is in working condition. If the instrument has issues, have it checked by a repair person. The instrument may or may not be repairable, depending upon how long it's been since the instrument was used, and how severe the damage is. Check for cracks in the body or pieces missing. Ensure that all of the pads seal, particularly the pads close to the bell. Check the bocal for dents and fissures. Assemble the boot. Rest the boot on the floor. Be careful not to bend any keys while you are assembling your bassoon. Place the tenor joint into the boot. Line up the bridge post on the side with its mate. If there is a pin attaching the tenor and long joints, unpin it if necessary. Then, carefully slide the long joint in. Make sure to align the bridge key mechanism well or the lower register won't function. Attach the bell. Press and hold down the low Bb key. Slide the bell onto the top of the long joint. Then release the key. Attach the hand rest, if applicable. If you have a hand rest, attach it to the boot joint on its female receiver. Situate it however is most comfortable for your hand. Place the bocal into the tenor joint. Don't hold the bocal at the end with the reed. Hold the bocal at its curve. Use careful back and forth turns to insert the bocal. The whisper key should align with the bocal vent hole. Attach the strap. If you'll be sitting, connect the seat strap to the bottom of the boot joint. Place it so that the bassoon's weight is resting on the strap. It's important to position the seat strap two inches from the front of your chair. If you'll be standing, use a neck strap instead of a seat strap. Connect the neck strap to the hook at the top of the boot joint. Adjust your strap. Have firm and upright posture. If you're sitting, your back should be straight against the back of your chair, with the seat strap beneath you and the boot on your right side. Whether you're using a neck or a seat strap, adjust the strap so that it supports the reed entering your mouth with your head facing forward. You shouldn't have to bend to reach the bocal. Prepare the reed. Soak the reed in water for a few moments. You can do this by submerging it in a reed soaker full of water, or by running it under a faucet. Remove the reed and let the water penetrate it. Carefully place the moist reed at the tip of the bocal and attach it. Playing Your Bassoon Make sure your mouth is clean. Don't wear any type of balm or cosmetics on your lips. Either brush your teeth first or gargle with mouthwash before you play your bassoon. Otherwise, food and bacteria residue can build up on your reeds and affect how they play. Position the bassoon. Keep your instrument at a 45 degree angle across your body. Holding it straight up can interfere with fingering and playing the lower register. Practice embouchure. Embouchure refers to the placement of your mouth, lips and tongue when playing an instrument. Place the reed in your mouth. Cover your teeth with your lips, keeping your lips relaxed. Don't bite down on the reed or flatten out your lips. Imagine that there is a drawstring in your lips, and someone is pulling the string towards the back of your mouth, forming a cushion over the reed with your lips. Your upper lip should almost touch the first wire. Keep your chin muscles stretched downward and your cheeks smooth. Practice in front of a mirror to make sure your embouchure is correct. Place your tongue properly. Use the tip of your tongue for articulating; for example, accent and staccato. Think of the way you would move your mouth to say the word \u201cdough.\u201d\nIf you are playing very fast, there is a special method for that called \u201cdouble tonguing.\u201d Repeatedly make the noises of the letters \u201cd\u201d and \u201cg\u201d in succession inside your mouth, up against the reed. Breathe comfortably. Breathe in with your diaphragm and out with your abdominal muscles. To better grasp this technique, try relaxed breathing by lying on your back on the floor (without your bassoon). This is a simple way to observe how you properly breathe with straight posture. Learn fingering. Consult a fingering chart and keep it nearby for reference while you are still learning. The whisper key is your left thumb's home base. Don't rest your right thumb on the bassoon. If you want to play sheet music, you'll need to learn music notations. You can learn how to read music and play the bassoon simultaneously by taking lessons. Try different air techniques. Practice fast and slow air flow. This will help you to observe how air stream affects pitch. Blow into the bocal slowly. Then increase your air flow without changing your embouchure. Practice vibrato. Vibrato is when you add pulsing to notes. Try not to use pressure from your jaw to make a vibrato effect. Use your abdomen primarily and your larynx secondarily to create vibrato pulsations. Maintaining Your Instrument Clean components regularly. Use a damp cloth to clean the keys after every use. Dust under the keys with a small brush. Wash saliva off the reed with water or by using light sandpaper on it. Every week, wipe down your bassoon with a damp cloth, without wetting the pads. Dry your instrument with a swab cloth. If your bassoon has a wood finish, polish it every two months with furniture polish. Polish silver keys monthly. You should have a professional repair person buff nickel keys annually. If your instruments' keys frequently tarnish despite regular cleaning, discuss it with the manufacturer of your bassoon. The climate you play in and the way you play your instrument may be contributing factors. For bassoons with a plastic finish, you can also use soap and water. Grease the tenons well. If there are strings on your tenons, you can grease those as well. Cork wound tenons require a bit more maintenance than thread wrapped tenons. Never use cork grease on thread wound tenons. For cork wound tenons, wipe off any old coating of grease. Then apply a thin layer of cork grease every two weeks. For thread wrapped tenons, warm a cake of canning wax in your hands until it softens. Then add a thin coat of wax onto the threads. Never use cork grease on thread wound tenons. Make adjustments to your reeds. Occasionally you will need to adjust your reed when it isn't sounding right. If the sound is flat, buzzy, or the reed responds too easily, the reed is too soft. If the sound is sharp, muffled, or the reed doesn't respond well, the reed is too hard. Fix a soft reed by opening the first and second wires carefully with needle-nose pliers. Gently slide the reed through 600 grit sandpaper. Then use 240 grit sandpaper lightly on both sides of the front half. Fix a hard reed by slightly closing the first and second wires with needle nose pliers. Gently sand both sides of the reed with 600 grit sandpaper. Then use 240 grit sandpaper to lightly sand the back third of of the reed on both sides, while focusing on the reed's center. Tend to the mechanisms. Every two weeks, apply heavy key oil to pivot screws, and light key oil to long screws. Every week, make sure all screws are tight.",
