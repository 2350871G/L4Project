Don't choose anything with buttons, and try to avoid blouses with decorative designs. You may be able to buy something like this in a department store, but it can be tough to find something plain enough (without buttons and designs)\nIf you don't have any luck, try searching online or at a costume shop.

It is worn over the white blouse. Traditional dirndls extend to the ankles, but shorter lengths are available. Many have a bodice-like design on the top, which is traditional, but some do not.

Pick out a knee-length to floor-length cotton A-line or circle skirt. Go with black, red, dark green, brown, or sky blue. Wear a laced-up bodice over your blouse. Authentic bodices are made of velvet or felt, but work with what you can find. The most traditional skirt option is mid-calf or floor-length.
