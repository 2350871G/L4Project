        "This type of paint has primer in it, which means that you will only need 1 or 2 coats of paint total.",
        "This will help reduce your workload and allow you to enjoy your new ceiling sooner.",
        "If you choose to use primer and paint separately, then you'll need to repeat the entire painting process twice: once for the primer and 1 to 2 times for the paint.",
        "Stir your paint and transfer it into a small bucket.",
        "Open your can of paint give it a stir with a paint stir stick.",
        "Hold the can over a smaller bucket, and slowly the paint into it; try to make the paint stream centered.",
        "Once you have the small bucket filled, put the lid back onto the big bucket.",
        "A smaller can will be lighter than a big can.",
        "It will take up less space and make it easier to move around and carry up and down a ladder.",
        "If you are using a ladder or scaffolding, you should climb onto it now.",
        "Leave the big bucket of paint on the ground and take the little bucket with you.",
        "Use a 2 to 2 \u20442 in (5.1 to 6.4 cm) brush to paint the edges of the ceiling.",
        "Apply the paint 2 to 2 \u20442 inches (5.1 to 6.4 cm) from the top edge of the wall, then work the paint towards the edge.",
        "Feather the paint towards the ceiling by a few inches/centimeters.",
        "If you are painting the walls, you can extend the paint a few inches/centimeters down the walls.",
        "The wall paint will cover it up.",
        "Feathering paint is where you run your brush across the painted area towards the unpainted area.",
        "Move the ladder around as you work your way from 1 side of the room to the other.",
        "If you can't reach the ceiling, mount your brush onto a telescoping extension pole.",
        "Secure the brush with zip ties and packaging tape.",
        "Stir the paint again and pour it into a paint tray.",
        "Climb off of the ladder and open the big can of paint.",
        "Give the paint a stir in case it settled, then pour the paint into a paint tray.",
        "Only pour as much paint as you need to in order to cover the bottom of the tray.",
        "Keep the rest of the paint in the can so that it does not dry out, and cover the can with a lid.",
        "Be sure to replace the lid on the big can of paint so that it doesn't dry out.",
        "Apply the paint to the ceiling with a damp paint roller.",
        "Dampen your paint roller with a wet towel first.",
        "Roll it across the paint tray, then roll it across the ceiling.",
        "Start at 1 corner of the room and work towards the other in 4 by 4 ft (1.2 by 1.2 m) sections.",
        "If you have a textured or popcorn ceiling, use a paint roller that has a \u20442 to \u20444 in (1.3 to 1.9 cm) deep nap.",
        "If you have a flat ceiling, you can use a basic paint roller with a short nap.",
        "After every couple of sections, go over the painted area with a clean, damp roller.",
        "This will smooth the paint out.",
        "If your paint roller doesn't extend, mount it onto a telescoping extension pole, just like you did with the paint brush.",
        "You can also use a ladder.",
        "Use an angled brush to paint around the fixtures.",
        "Mount your brush onto a telescoping pole.",
        "If the pole does not have a special attachment for the brush handle, secure the brush handle with zip ties and packaging tape.",
        "If your ladder or scaffolding is tall enough, then you may be able to use the brush as-is without mounting it onto a telescoping pole.",
        "Let the paint dry, then apply a second coat, if needed.",
        "You only need 1 coat of paint if you are applying a light color over a light color.",
        "If you are applying a light color over a dark color, or if you are using a dark color, you will need at least 2 coats of paint.",
        "Once the paint dries, you can remove the painter's tape.",
        "Let each coat dry before applying the next coat.",
        "It may take at least 1 to 2 hours for the paint to dry, depending on the brand and how humid the weather is.",
        "Some paints require a longer curing time of 2 to 3 days."
