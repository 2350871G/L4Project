While faux leather is the most common material, it\u2019s possible to have a plastic, wooden, or genuine leather steering wheel. When in doubt, check your owner\u2019s manual to find the material and the best practices for cleaning them. Make a mixture of 3 parts all-purpose disinfectant and 1 part water if your steering wheel is made of plastic or faux leather. Use wood polish if you have a steering wheel made of natural wood. Look for a wood grain texture on the wheel. Work with a leather cleaner or conditioner if your steering wheel is made from genuine leather. Faux leather and genuine leather are difficult to differentiate, so check your owner\u2019s manual to be sure.
