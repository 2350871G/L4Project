        "If you have difficulty keeping a straight face, you might want to practice some emotional control exercises.",
        "Set the trap of your prank.",
        "You'll probably want to make up an excuse to explain what you are doing because you'll need to ask to see the prankee's hand.",
        "Hold his hand palm up, and with your finger draw the rough image of his favorite fruit.",
        "Some excuses you might use to explain what you are doing:\n\"I learned a real cool trick in my psychology class.",
        "You can actually trick the brain into imagining certain smells, like fruit.",
        "Here, let me show you.\"",
        "\"The other day I was hanging out with my friend and he showed me this real cool magic trick.",
        "Can I show you?\"",

        "You want to give it a try?",
        "It's real easy.\"",
        "Tell the prankee to smell the image you've drawn.",

        "You are now in striking distance of completing your prank.",
        "Smack the prankee's hand lightly into his face.",
        "While the prankee is smelling his hand, hit it lightly so that he lightly smacks himself on the nose.",

        "\"It's OK, I fell for that one, too.",
        "That's why I had to pull it on you!\"",
        "\"I gotcha pretty good, didn't I?\"",
        "Pranking with an Air Horn Prank Know the goal of your prank.",
        "This prank will use a loud noise to startle the prankee.",
        "To accomplish this, you'll be using tape to fasten an air horn in an unlikely location in such a way that the airhorn is triggered and a loud noise made without the prankee realizing beforehand.",
        "For this prank, you'll need:\nAirhorn\nTape\n\nNOTE: depending on the surface you are taping your airhorn to, you may need gentler tape so as not to do damage to paint or wallpaper.",
        "Choose your moment to set up wisely.",
        "You should set up this prank when the prankee is away from the place you are planning to perform it.",
        "This way he won't overhear the airhorn when you test it out.",
        "He may figure out what you're doing if he hears you setting up!",
        "Determine the ideal location.",
        "When selecting your location, your ingenuity and imagination are the only limit.",
        "You might tape the airhorn to the wall in such a way that when a door is opened it causes the airhorn to go off, startling the prankee.",
        "You could put it beneath his chair so that when he sits the airhorn triggers.",
        "Use camouflage to disguise your airhorn when you are able.",
        "An airhorn taped to the bottom of a chair will be quite suspicious.",
        "Disguise this prank by putting a jacket or hoodie sweatshirt on the back of the chair to block the horn from view.",
        "Tape your prank into position.",
        "Take your tape and use it to attach your airhorn to the location you have chosen.",
        "You'll want to do a trail run after you've secured the airhorn in place so that you're certain the prank will work.",
        "Once you've set the prank, you'll have to wait for it to be sprung.",
        "Don't worry - you'll know it when you hear it.",
        "If the prankee is away for a period of time, you may want to check on your prank several times throughout the day.",
        "Depending on heat, humidity, tape quality, and the surface you've taped the airhorn to, your tape may loosen over time, ruining your prank.",
        "Set up a domino effect.",
        "People rarely expect to be pranked multiple times in a row.",
        "You can use this to your advantage to prank your target especially well.",
        "Do this by setting up several airhorn traps for the prankee in locations he's likely to trigger.",
        "Pranking a Car Break In Know the goal of your prank.",
        "A car is a big investment for most people, and by making your prankee believe that his car window has been destroyed, you can get a hilarious response out of him.",
        "You'll have some cleanup after you set up the prank, but to perform it you'll only need:\nCar window (similar to the prankee's car window)\nGloves (recommended; optional)\n\nNOTE: cheap car windows can likely be purchased from your local junkyard or salvage shop.",
        "You might even be able to get staff to help you choose the right kind of window by bringing them in on the prank!",
        "Borrow the prankee's keys.",
        "You don't want to be accused of theft at any point during this prank, so you should only do this with close friends.",
        "While the prankee is otherwise occupied, like right before he wakes up in the morning, snag his keys and unlock his car.",
        "Then:\nRemove anything of value from the car.",
        "You don't want anything to be stolen because of your prank!",
        "Roll down one of the windows of his car so that it is completely inside the door and cannot be seen.",
        "Shatter your window carefully and quietly.",
        "Then use your gloves to spread the glass around the door of the rolled down window and a little bit inside the car to make it look realistic.",
        "Prepare yourself to be shocked.",
        "To get the best response out of the prankee, you might want to agitate him by getting upset with him over his car being broken into.",
        "You might point out that at least he didn't have anything valuable in the car - an excellent tactic if you've removed something valuable from the car the night before when setting up your prank.",
        "Time your prank to prevent actual theft.",
        "With the window rolled down, the prankee's car will be vulnerable to actual theft.",
        "You'll either need to keep an eye on it so it isn't stolen, or time your prank so that the car is only left unattended for a few moments before your friend comes out and sees it.",
        "You might arrange for your friend to drive you somewhere the morning of your prank so you know exactly when the both of you will be headed to the car.",
        "Don't perform this prank before the prankee leaves for work.",
        "Shattered glass can be dangerous, even if his car window isn't actually broken.",
        "Enjoy the reaction and clean up the mess.",
        "Since you were the one pranking and had fun at the prankee's expense, you should be the one to clean up the mess of your prank.",
        "Use a vacuum cleaner to suck up little bits of glass that are scattered on the inside of the car and sweep up any shards outside the car as well."
