(If you have paper coloured on both sides, the side that faces up now is the colour that will show in the end.) Crease the paper horizontally and vertically, as shown.  Turn the paper over and rotate it 45 degrees, so that it appears as a square.  Fold it horizontally and vertically.

Fold all four corners inwards to meet the corners of the inner square.  Fold all four sides inwards to meet the sides of the small square.  Pick the paper up and fold the diagonal fold lines outwards and horizontal fold lines inwards. This forms a double-layered triangle, known as the waterbomb-base. Press your new triangle flat.  Fold its upper tip down as far as possible.  Insert your finger between the double layers of the triangle and push the upper layer upwards. This turns the model 3-D.
