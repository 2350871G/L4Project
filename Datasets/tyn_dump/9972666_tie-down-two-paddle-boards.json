    "text": " Getting the Equipment and Laying the Boards Make sure you have the proper roof racks with crossbars. You can purchase roof racks made specifically to carry surfboards or paddleboards from a surfing store or online. Your roof racks should have 2 bars that span the width of your car. You may want to purchase and attach a fabric cover over the bars so that you don\u2019t scratch your boards. Purchase 3 locking straps. Locking straps have a metal buckle on one end that\u2019s used to secure the straps. If you want to safely transport your boards on top of a vehicle, it\u2019s important that you buy these straps. You can purchase these straps online or at surfing stores. Lay 1 board on top of the rack with the fins facing up. Carefully lay the board down so that it lies flat and centered on top of your roof rack. The fins of the board should be facing upward and towards the front of the car. If your boards are different lengths, put the longer board on the bottom. Lay the other board on top of the first board. Place the second board on top of the first board, with the fins facing up and towards the front of the car. The second board should be slightly offset towards the back of the car to make room for the bottom board\u2019s fins. Make sure that the second board lays flat on the first before moving onto the next step. Securing the Boards to the Roof Rack Thread a locking strap under the back crossbeam. Start on the right side of the vehicle. Thread the end without the buckle, or the free end, under the back crossbeam and pull it so that both sides are an equal length. Throw the free end of the strap over the boards. Walk over to the other side of your vehicle with the end of the strap with the buckle. Make sure that both ends of the strap are draped over the top of the boards and are laying flat. Do not throw the buckled end or you may damage your car. Thread the strap through the bar on the other side of the rack. Pull the free end of the strap to create some slack before threading it. The buckled end should sit flat on the top board. Make sure that you don't pull the free end too much or the other side of the strap may come undone. Tighten and secure the buckle. Take the free end of the strap and feed it through the small opening on the top of the buckle. Pull on the free end to tighten the strap over your boards, and press down on the tab on the buckle to secure it. Pull harder on the free end of the strap to tighten it more, if need be. Repeat the process on the front bar of the roof rack. Feed another strap under both sides of the front roof rack, tighten it, and secure the buckle. Wiggle your boards to see whether the straps are tight. If they aren't, tighten both straps again. The front straps should be behind the fins on the paddleboard. Attaching the Safety Strap Open your back doors. Both doors will need to be open because you\u2019ll be attaching the strap inside of the car. The safety strap serves as a way to attach the boards to the car even if the roof rack detaches from your car. If you are attaching more than 1 board to your car, a safety strap is essential. Throw the free end of the strap over the boards. Go into your car and pull the free end of the strap into the car with you. The strap should now be completely wrapped around the top of the boards and inside of your vehicle. When you throw the free end over, make sure it goes to the other side of your vehicle. Tighten and secure the strap inside of the vehicle. Take the free end of the strap and feed it through the hole on top of the buckle. Pull the free end to take all the slack out of the strap, then press down on the tab of the buckle to secure it. You'll have to go into the back seat to grab the free end of the strap. Close both your doors. Close the doors on the straps. Your boards are now secured in 3 separate places and should not fall off of the vehicle while you\u2019re driving. Closing the doors on the strap will keep the straps tight even if the buckle fails.",
