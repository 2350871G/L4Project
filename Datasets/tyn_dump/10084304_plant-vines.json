If you notice dry petals, drooping, burnt leaf edges, or a faded or washed out color, your vines are probably not getting enough sun. On the other hand, partial sunlight is between 4 to 6 hours a day, and signs of too much sun exposure are pale, yellowish-green leaves, shriveled dry leaves, or leaves with brown spots. Many vines can tolerate both full and partial sunlight, including the Virginia Creeper, Dutchman's Pipe, Trumpet Vine, American Bittersweet, Boston Ivy, Climbing Hydrangea, Honeysuckle, Clematis, and Hops. Vines like Gourds, Passion Flower, Hardy Kiwi, Perennial Sweet Pea, and Kentucky Wisteria require full sunlight. Both annual and perennial varieties require a specific amount of sunlight. The Tri-Color Kiwi English Ivy, English Ivy, and Moonlight require partial sunlight."

Alternatively, aluminum sulfate additions decrease pH instantaneously, but are more difficult to control. Dolomitic limestone additions raise the pH of soils low in magnesium.
