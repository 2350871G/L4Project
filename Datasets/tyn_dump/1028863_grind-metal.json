These types of grinders work best on large jobs or making straight cuts since they are bigger and cannot easily move with finesse. Electric grinders do not work well in tight spaces or curves. Pick an air grinder for small jobs that require finesse. Air, or pneumatic, grinders use pressurized air to power the machine.

Air grinders do not have as much torque so they can\u2019t cut through metal easily. Put on a grinding wheel on for large jobs. Grinding wheels are thick pieces of compressed composites that quickly grind through thick metals and remove big problems, like rust or tarnish. Grinding wheels generate a lot of heat, which could cause thinner pieces of metal to warp. If a grinding wheel cracks from the heat, it could break and throw shrapnel. Use a Dremel tool with a grinding stone for small jobs. Dremel tools are small, handheld rotary tools used to shave away material. For work like sharpening blades, removing rust, or smoothing out short welds, use your Dremel. There are many different styles of Dremel heads that you can attach to get smooth or rough finishes. Smooth welds with a flap disc. A flap disc is made of layers of sandpaper fit onto a hard backing piece.

Grinding Metal Corners Use an 80-grit flap disc on your grinder when working on an outer corner. An 80-grit flap grinder will smooth out your surface without leaving deep scratches that lower grit disc would leave.
