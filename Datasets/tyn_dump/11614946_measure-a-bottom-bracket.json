Unscrew this piece by turning your tool counterclockwise and set it aside.Tip: If the nut or bolt is embedded in the crank wheel, use a crank extractor tool to reach the nut or bolt. Insert it into the opening and wrap it around the nut or bolt. Then, use a wrench to turn the tool counterclockwise. You cannot access or measure a bottom bracket without moving the crankshaft.

Inspect the area near your bike\u2019s crankshaft for a horizontal cylinder that connects to your pedals. This is the shell for your bottom bracket. Spread the jaws on your calipers out and slide them around the openings on each side of the shell. Slide the movable jaw on the calipers so that they\u2019re flush against the 2 openings of the shell. Measure your width and write down.Tip: Bottom bracket measurements are kind of confusing. For bracket dimensions, the first number is always the width of the shell. The second number is always the length of the bracket itself from spindle to spindle. Bottom bracket measurements are always taken in millimeters. The most common sizes for the width of the shell are 68 mm and 73 mm. You can use a ruler instead of calipers if you prefer. It\u2019s easier to get a precise measurement with calipers, though. To use your calipers, slide the jaws sticking out of the ruler until they\u2019re flush against 2 surfaces. The number above the hash mark on the movable jaw is your measurement. You can do this with the bracket installed on the bike or measure the bracket separately.

The length typically ranges from 113-122 mm. If you\u2019re replacing a bottom bracket, the length of your new bracket must match the length of your old bracket. If you\u2019re replacing the bracket and the pedals though, your bottom bracket\u2019s length must match the required bracket length of your new pedals. The spindles are the little pegs that stick out of the bottom bracket on both sides. You can do this with the bracket installed on the bike, or measure it separately.
