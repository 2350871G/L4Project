        "Hold the speaker plate to the back of the speaker, lining up the newly drilled holes with the holes in the plate.",
        "Insert the required screws and use a screwdriver or a power drill to secure the screws into the speaker.In some cases, the screw may be able to be secured using an allen key that comes with the mount.",
        "Hanging Your Speakers with the Mounts Reattach the mount arm to the ceiling plate if required.",
        "The exact method required here depends upon your speaker mount.",
        "In some cases, the end of the mount arm will have a ball shaft attached that needs to be pushed back into the socket joint on the ceiling plate.",
        "Then, the ball shaft is secured to the socket joint using a socket wrench or allen key to tighten the tension bolt.You will need to hold the full weight of the speaker while securing the arm in place.",
        "You may want to enlist the help of a friend if your speaker is heavy.",
        "Attach an extension arm to the ceiling plate if needed.",
        "Some ceiling mounts will include an extension arm so the speaker will hang further down from the ceiling.",
        "In general, these extension arms are only to be used when mounting the speaker to the ceiling, not the wall.",
        "If your mount has an extension arm, slide that arm into or onto the ceiling plate, then use an allen key to tighten the screw on the arm into the ceiling plate.Mounts that come with extension arms may also come with \u2018low profile\u2019 arms.",
        "Low profile arms are shorter and will hold the speaker closer to the ceiling than the extension arm.",
        "Low profile arms are attached to the ceiling plate using the same method as the extension arm.",
        "Install the speaker to the ceiling mount if not already done.",
        "If the mounting arm was attached to the ceiling plate first, you now need to attach the speaker to that arm.",
        "Hold the speaker up to the ceiling plate and mounting arm and slide the mount assembly from the back of the speaker into or onto the arm.",
        "Use an allen key to secure the arm to the speaker.You may need to stand further up on your ladder, or get a higher ladder, for this step as you\u2019ll need to be quite close to the ceiling to access the mount arm and back of the speaker.",
        "String the wires from your speakers to an amplifier or receiver.",
        "Now that your speaker is hanging from the ceiling, it\u2019s time to attach the speaker wire to your amplifier or receiver.",
        "You have a couple of options for doing this.",
        "One option is to simply run the wire on the outside of the ceiling and wall.",
        "Another option is to run the wire behind the ceiling and wall.",
        "While a final option is to connect your speakers using wifi or Bluetooth so there are no wires involved.Unfortunately, not all speakers have wifi or Bluetooth capabilities and such capabilities cannot be added to a speaker after the fact."
