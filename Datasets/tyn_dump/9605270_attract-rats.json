        "Place some bait just outside the trap.",
        "Food that\u2019s sitting out in the open is easier to see.",
        "Leaving a few pieces where they\u2019re easy to grab will also motivate the rats to wander into the trap in order to get more.",
        "Cut your bait of choice into thin strips or small crumbs so that they can be eaten quickly.",
        "Cautious rats might attempt to drag bigger chunks back to their nests or nibble around the edges from a safe distance.",
        "Use the same bait consistently.",
        "Rodents are suspicious of objects they haven\u2019t encountered before.",
        "Once they develop a taste for something, however, they\u2019ll keep coming back for more.",
        "For this reason, it\u2019s a good idea to stick with one or two items rather than continuously switching them up.",
        "Don\u2019t give up on a particular food or lure if it doesn't work immediately.",
        "It may take a few days for the rats to work up enough curiosity to sample it."
