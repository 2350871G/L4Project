Kings can still only move one diagonal space at a time during a non-capture move. However, when a king is capturing checkers, it can move forward and backward on the same turn. This would apply only if a king was doing a capture move that required it to change directions, such as if two checkers were lined up on diagonal spaces that fall into the same horizontal line. To capture these checkers, the king would have to jump forwards and then backwards. Some checkers sets have a crown on the back of the checkers, so you can just flip a piece over once it is crowned to designate it as the king. There is no limit to how many crowned pieces you can have."
