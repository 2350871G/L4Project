Collecting and storing seeds from your own garden ensures that you always have backups if any of your favorite plants die. Collecting and storing your own seeds allows you to control their quality.

You\u2019ll get better at identifying which seeds are ready for collecting with practice, but having a few basic facts at your fingertips will help guide you through the process. Seeds need the living plant to give them nourishment while they swell into full size in the seed coat. Collect seeds from plants before frost or it rains. Seeds may absorb moisture, swell and crack, which damages the ability to properly germinate. Depending on what seeds you\u2019re collecting, the growing and seed harvesting season begins in March and ends in fall. Late summer is the peak season. Check plants regularly for fading flowers and forming seeds. If plant heads are turning brown, this is also a good time to collect your seeds. You can collect seeds while they\u2019re still green, but let them continue to ripen in the pod or seed head. Harvest seeds when the seeds are a good size and then let them finish maturing in a bag or on some newspaper in a cool place. Don\u2019t necessarily pick seed heads as soon as petals fade. For plants like sunflowers, for example, wait until the visible seeds have plumped up, a sign that they\u2019re mature."

Learning a few basic facts about plant shapes can help you more easily identify where the seeds are. The largest family of flowering plants are called Compositae (Asteraceae) and include flowers such as sunflowers, black-eyed Susans, daisies, and zinnias. Many of these flowers have a green, yellow, brown or black \"eye\" in the center which produce both the flowers and the seeds. The seeds will develop in that \"eye\" forming a seed head. Oftentimes the \"eye\" looks like a button and sometimes it can look a bit like a cone like in purple coneflowers and Rudbeckias. Some Compositae flowers, like those of marigolds, have tight bunches of petals, with no \u201ceye,\u201d but the seeds develop right in the center. When sowing these seeds the easiest method is to break apart the cone or button and sow the seeds directly in the ground. Plants in the mint family, such as basil, grow tiny flowers along a stem. These tiny flowers produce very small seeds that are best harvesting by snipping the entire stalk. The seeds of vegetables and fruits, including tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers are inside the flesh of the plant. Strawberries are an example of a fruit that have seeds on the surface."
