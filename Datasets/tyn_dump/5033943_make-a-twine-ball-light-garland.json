They are often sold as \u201cfairy lights\". You can use standard lights that you plug into a wall, but keep in mind that they tend to contain more bulbs, so you'll have to make more twine balls. If you want a large garland with giant twine balls, consider plug-in icicle lights instead. You can stuff each icicle into each giant twine ball."

How many you blow up depends on how many lights are on your garland. You will need 1 balloon for each light on the garland. You don't have to blow regular balloons up to their full size. Keep in mind that they will end up more oval or egg-shaped. You should still blow water balloons up with air; don't use water. Match the size of the balloon to the bulb. Small balloons will work better for tiny fairy lights than standard-sized balloons. If you are using icicle lights, you will need 1 balloon for each icicle."
