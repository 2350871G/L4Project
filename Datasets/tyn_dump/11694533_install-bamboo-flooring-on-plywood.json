An 80-tooth carbide blade will cut any type of bamboo flooring without issue. Once you have a suitable blade, locate the nut on the blade holster at the front of the circular saw. Turn it clockwise with a wrench to remove it, remove the old blade, then install the new one.Strand bamboo is estimated to be 3 times as strong as hardwood flooring, so weaker sawblades leave jagged edges that make the flooring look worse than it should. This type of flooring is identifiable by the numerous individual strands of bamboo running along the length of each board. Horizontal and vertical bamboo are a little softer than strand bamboo and can be cut with a 40-tooth blade. These boards are made with individual, solid strips of bamboo. Check the packaging if you\u2019re uncertain what kind of flooring you have."

Make sure you leave enough space between the flooring and every wall in the room. Keep this gap in mind while you\u2019re laying down the flooring.The expansion gap can be as much as \u20444 in (1.9 cm) in size. Make sure it is no less than \u20444 in (0.64 cm) in size, though. To maintain the gap, you can set something between the flooring and the wall. Try using small pieces of scrap wood called spacers, for instance. The bamboo boards expand and contract as the temperature changes. If they don\u2019t have room to expand, they push against one another, then buckle and crack.

To make your flooring as strong as possible, position the second row so the joints are in a different spot. Try placing the boards so the joints fall about \u2153 of the way along the lengths of the initial boards.One way to ensure the joints are staggered is by cutting the boards to different length. Flooring packs sometimes come with boards of different lengths to make staggering easier. Staggering the joints prevents the boards from separating over time. It also makes the floor look better when it is finished. For a long-lasting floor, make sure the joints in adjacent rows are no closer than 6 in (15 cm) from one another."

Be wary of what you\u2019re bringing into the room with your shoes, especially if you are going outside. Install the new flooring as soon as possible to prevent new debris from getting onto the plywood. Use a carpenter\u2019s level to check that the plywood is level. Place the carpenter\u2019s level against the floor near one of the corners. The level will have a small capsule of liquid in the center. If the bubble inside the liquid shifts to one side, then that side is higher than the other.

You could also use a floor sander to wear down high spots in the plywood. Fit the sander with a 36-grit disk and even out the floor. Remember to sweep up the debris afterward. Roll a \u20448 in (0.32 cm)-thick foam underlayment over the floor for cushioning. The underlayment comes in a big roll, so push the roll along the length of the room to apply it.

However, if you no longer have the information, you can always measure the panels yourself. Divide the room and flooring widths to determine how many panels you need. Subtract \u20448 in (1.6 cm) from the room\u2019s width first to account for a gap needed during the installation. Then, divide the result by the width of an individual floor panel. Use this number to determine how many rows of panels are needed to cover the entire floor.For example, if you have a room 108 in (270 cm) wide:  108 in - 5/8 in = 107 \u215c in. Then:  108 \u215c in / 7 in panels = about 15 \u2156 rows. Bamboo flooring tends to look best when it is installed parallel to the longest wall in the room. If you\u2019re going to install the panels a different way, make the necessary adjustments to your measurements. Mark your measurements on the panels in pencil before cutting them. Unless your room is the perfect size for the panels, you will have to cut the final row to size. You may also have to cut the length of the end panels down to fit them along the room\u2019s length. Use your measurements to draw outlines so you know where to cut each panel.Try to make the flooring even on all sides. If the final row will be less than 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm) wide, cut it the first row to the same size so the flooring looks better in the end. Follow the same rules when cutting panels to length. Make the end panels on both sides of the room about the same size so the room looks even. Note that cutting the boards lengthwise is often easier after laying them out on the floor. Put on a dust mask and safety glasses before cutting the flooring. Cover up to protect yourself from dust and any fragments released during the cutting process. Avoid wearing safety gloves, jewelry, or anything else that could get caught under the blade. If you are able to, cut the flooring panels outdoors to reduce the amount of dust left in your home. If you\u2019re working indoors, you can vacuum up any dust before installing the flooring.Keep other people and pets out of the area. Unplug and pack up the saw when you\u2019re done. Install an 80-tooth, carbide blade on a circular saw. Bamboo is deceptively strong, so your choice of blade has a big effect on how the cut flooring turns out. An 80-tooth carbide blade will cut any type of bamboo flooring without issue. Once you have a suitable blade, locate the nut on the blade holster at the front of the circular saw. Turn it clockwise with a wrench to remove it, remove the old blade, then install the new one.Strand bamboo is estimated to be 3 times as strong as hardwood flooring, so weaker sawblades leave jagged edges that make the flooring look worse than it should. This type of flooring is identifiable by the numerous individual strands of bamboo running along the length of each board. Horizontal and vertical bamboo are a little softer than strand bamboo and can be cut with a 40-tooth blade. These boards are made with individual, solid strips of bamboo. Check the packaging if you\u2019re uncertain what kind of flooring you have. Use the circular saw to trim the boards to the required size. Lay the boards across a pair of sawhorses. To use the saw, hold onto the grips with both hands and push it slowly along the saw. Follow the guidelines you traced earlier. Keep the saw steady while moving at a consistent rate to get a clean finish that will look great when the boards are installed.If you\u2019re using a stationary saw, slowly move the boards toward the blade instead. Watch your fingers as you get close to the saw. Keep them on the edges of the board so they are far away from the blade. Gluing the Flooring Together Measure \u204416 in (0.79 cm) from each wall to leave a gap between the flooring. This gap is called an expansion gap and is used to prevent the flooring from cracking over time. Make sure you leave enough space between the flooring and every wall in the room. Keep this gap in mind while you\u2019re laying down the flooring.The expansion gap can be as much as \u20444 in (1.9 cm) in size. Make sure it is no less than \u20444 in (0.64 cm) in size, though. To maintain the gap, you can set something between the flooring and the wall. Try using small pieces of scrap wood called spacers, for instance. The bamboo boards expand and contract as the temperature changes. If they don\u2019t have room to expand, they push against one another, then buckle and crack. The expansion gap ensures that your new floor lasts as long as possible! Lay the flooring along the length of the room. Start in the corner furthest from the room\u2019s exit. Set the first board there, keeping it close to the walls. Position additional boards one at a time along the wall. Each board will have a tab called a tongue on one end and an open groove on the other. Fit the tongues into the grooves to snap the boards together.Each board also has a tongue and groove along its length. Position the first row so that the grooved end faces the wall. If you didn\u2019t already cut the boards to length, detach the end board and cut them now. Measure the gap between the wall and the next boards in the row to figure out how much to cut. Line up the second row of boards to stagger the joints. The joints are the spots where a pair of boards meet. If you stand up and look down at the boards, you will be able to spot these joint lines. To make your flooring as strong as possible, position the second row so the joints are in a different spot. Try placing the boards so the joints fall about \u2153 of the way along the lengths of the initial boards.One way to ensure the joints are staggered is by cutting the boards to different length. Flooring packs sometimes come with boards of different lengths to make staggering easier. Staggering the joints prevents the boards from separating over time. It also makes the floor look better when it is finished. For a long-lasting floor, make sure the joints in adjacent rows are no closer than 6 in (15 cm) from one another. Spread a urethane wood glue onto the second row of boards with a trowel. Dip the trowel into the bucket of glue, then apply it all over the tongues on the second line of boards. Keep the coating thin but even. Remember to cover the top and bottom of each tongue as well as its side.The same products used for hardwood also work well on bamboo. Urethane is water-resistant, so it\u2019s what most installers use. If you desire a more permanent installation, you can spread the glue on the underside of the boards as well. This only works if you\u2019re installing them directly onto plywood or another hard surface. It\u2019s more expensive and time-consuming, but it leads to a more stable floor. Fit the boards together by pushing the grooves onto the tongues. Pick up the boards and begin slotting them into the grooves in the first row. Hold them up diagonally at an angle. After pushing them into the other boards, lower them onto the floor to snap them together.When you\u2019re done, you can apply blue painter\u2019s tape across the boards to help hold them together. If you\u2019re careful, the boards won\u2019t move at all while you finish the installation, even if you don\u2019t use tape. Finish laying the rest of the boards on the floor. Repeat the process to cover the rest of the floor. Lay down adjacent rows, then spread glue on the tongues before snapping the boards together. Cut the boards as needed to fit them into the room, especially along doorways.Doorways can be tricky, so the boards may not fit perfectly at first. To deal with this problem, place all of the boards first, then measure the doorway to cut the board to fit around the doorway. Wait about one day for the glue to dry before using the room. Give the glue plenty of time to dry so the flooring doesn\u2019t slip out of place. You can usually walk on it after 15 to 20 hours, but give it more time if you are able to. Don\u2019t move any heavy furniture back until the glue has completely dried.The drying time varies a little depending on the conditions. It takes longer to dry during cold or humid weather. Nailing the Flooring in Place Lay the initial row of boards along the length of the room. Position the first board in the corner opposite of the exit. Remember to leave a gap of at least \u204416 in (0.79 cm) between the board and the surrounding walls. Make sure the grooved side of the board faces the wall as well. Then, place adjacent boards until you reach the opposite end of the room.Each board has a groove and tongue along its shorter end. Slide the tongues into the grooves to secure the boards together. You can wait to cut the final board in the row to ensure it fits perfectly. Place all the boards, then measure the gap between the last one and the wall. Cut the final board to fit. Use a brad nail gun to nail the boards every 8 in (20 cm) along the wall. Starting at the first board you placed, measure along the grooved end facing the wall. Load your nail gun with 18-gauge stainless steel brad nails 2 in (5.1 cm) long. Keep the nail about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) from the edge of the board as well. Then, apply the nail straight through the board and into the plywood.Make sure the boards and nails are spaced properly so you don\u2019t have to readjust them. You could end up having to replace boards due to too many nail holes ruining the finish. Nail the tongue side of the board at a 45-degree angle. Use the same nails and nail gun. Start with the first board and measure 8 in (20 cm) from the end again, this time along the opposite side. Hold the nail gun in the center of the exposed edge, tilting it back toward you at a 45-degree angle. Then, apply a nail every 8 in (20 cm).Make sure the boards are well-secured to the plywood. If you are able to move them, the nails didn\u2019t pass all the way through the boards. Pull out the nails and replace them. Fit the next row of boards in place while staggering the joints. Begin attaching the next row of boards to the first one. Hold the boards up slightly at an angle while slotting the grooves onto the tongues, then lower them to the floor to snap them together. Check the joints, which are the spots where 2 boards in the same row meet. Make sure they aren\u2019t positioned next to the joints from the original row.Try to position the joints about \u2153 of the way from the ends of the boards in the first row. You can cut the boards to different lengths to stagger the joints. Staggering the joints leads to a stronger, more damage-resistant floor. It also causes the finished floor to look better. Nail the new row of boards at a 45-degree angle. Position the nails along the ridged tongue side rather than the grooved side you connected to the other boards. Nail through this unconnected end. Place nails about every 8 in (20 cm) to keep all of the boards well-secured.The additional row won\u2019t be movable once you nail it in place. Since it\u2019s wedged up against the first row, it won\u2019t shift while you\u2019re walking on it. Finish laying and nailing the remaining boards. Lay down another row, nailing it down before moving on to the next row. You can nail them to the floor the same way as the initial rows. Use the 45-degree angle technique with the nail gun to place nails every 8 in (20 cm) along the exposed length of each board.After getting the first pair of rows down, the rest of the floor is much easier to complete. However, take your time to ensure that both the boards and nails are well-positioned. Secure the final row with straight nails on the edge closest to the wall. The final row is similar to the first one you secured. Plan on placing the nails about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) from the side wall. Then, measure 8 in (20 cm) along the length of the board. Nail straight down through the board, then continue placing evenly spaced nails this way.You may need to cut the boards first to better fit tight areas like doorways. Make sure you do this before nailing the boards to the floor!",

        "Nail the new row of boards at a 45-degree angle.",
        "Position the nails along the ridged tongue side rather than the grooved side you connected to the other boards.",
        "Nail through this unconnected end.",
        "Place nails about every 8 in (20 cm) to keep all of the boards well-secured.The additional row won\u2019t be movable once you nail it in place.",
        "Since it\u2019s wedged up against the first row, it won\u2019t shift while you\u2019re walking on it.",
        "Finish laying and nailing the remaining boards.",
        "Lay down another row, nailing it down before moving on to the next row.",
        "You can nail them to the floor the same way as the initial rows.",
        "Use the 45-degree angle technique with the nail gun to place nails every 8 in (20 cm) along the exposed length of each board.After getting the first pair of rows down, the rest of the floor is much easier to complete.",
        "However, take your time to ensure that both the boards and nails are well-positioned.",
        "Secure the final row with straight nails on the edge closest to the wall.",
        "The final row is similar to the first one you secured.",
        "Plan on placing the nails about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) from the side wall.",
        "Then, measure 8 in (20 cm) along the length of the board.",
        "Nail straight down through the board, then continue placing evenly spaced nails this way.You may need to cut the boards first to better fit tight areas like doorways.",
        "Make sure you do this before nailing the boards to the floor!"
