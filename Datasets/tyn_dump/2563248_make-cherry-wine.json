Frozen cherries already have the seeds removed, so there will be less work involved when using frozen cherries. You can also freeze fresh cherries, just make sure to take the seeds out first!

Some winemakers choose not to wash the fruit before crushing. Since fruit has natural yeasts on its skin, it's possible to make wine using only the yeast from the fruit's skin and the air. However, washing the fruit and controlling the yeast you add allows you to ensure that the flavor of the wine will be to your liking\nAllowing wild yeast to grow can produce foul flavors. If you're up for an experiment, you could make two batches of wine, one with controlled yeast and one with wild, to find out which you like best."

Insert whichever tool you choose into the stem end of the cherry. You should feel it hit the pit. Twist your tool around the pit and pop it out. This is not easy. Be patient, experiment a bit for the twisting motion that works best for you. Insert a pastry tip or straw into the stem end of a cherry and push it through.

To make a dry wine, let your mixture ferment completely, allowing the yeast to consume all of the sugar. Here are some things to consider when making \"dry\" wine:\nAfter about 2 weeks most of the sugar will have been consumed by the yeast and fermentation will slow, making it easier to keep track of the falling sugar level of your wine. Tracking the sugar level will give you an idea of how your fermentation has been progressing. You may wish to stop the fermentation early and leave a bit of residual sugar in your wine. The fermentation is considered done when you either reach your desired sugar level or go \"dry\" at 0\u00b0 Brix on the wine scale. A wine with 0.2% residual sugar contains two grams of sugar in a liter of wine. Dry wines are typically in the 0.2%-0.3% range, off-dry wines in the 1.0%-5.0% range, and sweet dessert wines are normally 5.0%-10%.

This way, you won't risk over-oaking your wine. The oak powder will also sink to the bottom of your crock during fermentation, making siphoning easier. When adding oak powder to a batch of homemade wine, you'll want to add anywhere from 4 to 20 grams per gallon, depending on the type of wine (white vs. red) and desired flavor. Generally speaking, for six U.S. gallons of wine you would add about 40 to 50 grams of oak powder for a white wine, or 70 to 85 grams of oak powder for a red wine."

        "Morello cherries work well for a dry wine.",
        "Make a \"dry\" wine.",
        "A dry wine is simply a wine that has no residual sugar, meaning it isn\u2019t sweet.",
        "To make a dry wine, let your mixture ferment completely, allowing the yeast to consume all of the sugar.",
        "Here are some things to consider when making \"dry\" wine:\nAfter about 2 weeks most of the sugar will have been consumed by the yeast and fermentation will slow, making it easier to keep track of the falling sugar level of your wine.",
        "Tracking the sugar level will give you an idea of how your fermentation has been progressing.",
        "You may wish to stop the fermentation early and leave a bit of residual sugar in your wine.",
        "The fermentation is considered done when you either reach your desired sugar level or go \"dry\" at 0\u00b0 Brix on the wine scale.",
        "A wine with 0.2% residual sugar contains two grams of sugar in a liter of wine.",
        "Dry wines are typically in the 0.2%-0.3% range, off-dry wines in the 1.0%-5.0% range, and sweet dessert wines are normally 5.0%-10%.",
        "There is no \"correct\" sugar level for your wine, it just comes down to your personal preference.",
        "Oak your wine!",
        "You can give your wine an intriguing flavor by adding small amounts of oak during the fermenting process.",
        "Here are some things to consider:\nUse oak powder.",
        "This way, you won't risk over-oaking your wine.",
        "The oak powder will also sink to the bottom of your crock during fermentation, making siphoning easier.",
        "When adding oak powder to a batch of homemade wine, you'll want to add anywhere from 4 to 20 grams per gallon, depending on the type of wine (white vs. red) and desired flavor.",
        "Generally speaking, for six U.S. gallons of wine you would add about 40 to 50 grams of oak powder for a white wine, or 70 to 85 grams of oak powder for a red wine."
