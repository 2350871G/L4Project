Instructions for making silly putty are as follows:\nTo make silly putty, you'll need Elmer's Glue-All Multipurpose Glue, Sta-Flo concentrated liquid starch, a measuring cup, a spoon, and a mixing bowl. Pour the glue into a mixing bowl. The more glue, the more silly putty. Keep track of how much you put in. For example, if you've got a 4-ounce bottle of glue, maybe you'll want to put in half, giving you 2 ounces of glue in the bowl. Use your measuring cup to measure out as much liquid starch as the amount of glue you used. Then pour that liquid starch into the bowl with the glue. Use a spoon to mix and stir together the starch and glue in the bowl. Let it sit for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, take the putty out of the bowl. Knead the putty with your hands for 5 to 10 minutes to make sure there are no inconsistencies in the mix."
