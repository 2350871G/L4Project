    "text": " Finding the Measurements on the Chainsaw Look on the side of the bar near the user end for the measurements. The bar of the chainsaw is the long metallic blade that the chain is wrapped around. The user end is the casing around the motor where the handle is located. The chainsaw\u2019s measurements are usually stamped on the right side of the bar, although this varies depending on the maker of the chainsaw bar. Read the left-most fraction printed on the bar to find the pitch. The denominator of this fraction will probably have an inch symbol next to it.

For example, if the number on the bar reads \u201c3/8\", this means that the chainsaw\u2019s pitch is \u20448 inch (0.95 cm). Check for a number next to an image of a drive link.
