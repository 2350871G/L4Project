In addition, it cannot be mixed directly into a skin care product without being dissolved first. If it isn\u2019t dissolved, the arbutin will just sit in the product like flaky chunks of powder and won\u2019t spread evenly across your skin.Warning: When buying alpha arbutin powder, make sure that you\u2019re purchasing it from a reputable source.

If you plan on using it every day, use 20\u201325 grams (0.71\u20130.88 oz) or more. If you only plan on using alpha arbutin on occasion, use 10\u201315 grams (0.35\u20130.53 oz). Use a digital scale to weigh out your arbutin, or purchase a bottle containing the exact amount that you plan on using. The 2 main reasons to use alpha arbutin are for skin lightening and covering blemishes from skin discoloration. If you\u2019re trying to lighten your skin, start off with a 2-month supply (around 25 grams (0.88 oz)) so that you can make adjustments to your skin lightening formula once you find what\u2019s working for you."

To determine how much you need, multiply the amount of arbutin by 5 and convert it to milliliters. For example, if you\u2019re using 25 grams (0.88 oz) of arbutin, multiply it by 5 to get 125 grams (4.4 oz). This converts to 125 millilitres (0.53  c) of water."
