It\u2019s easy to mix herbs together or ruin the flavors of the herbs by drying them together. To protect the flavor, only dry one herb at a time. Preparing the Herbs Remove any damaged, soiled, or imperfect leaves or stems. Check each leaf or stalk for ruined pieces.

If you use a rack, place it over the cookie sheet to prevent bits of herbs from falling down into the bottom of the oven. Lay your herbs on the tray in a single layer row.
