If you are cleaning a small aluminum object, bring water and vinegar to a boil inside a pot, then take the pot off the heat and drop the aluminum object inside. Let it soak for 15 minutes, then take it out and rinse it off. If you are cleaning a large aluminum surface, soak a cloth in vinegar, then wipe it across the oxidation. Scrub with a soft-bristled brush, then wipe away the vinegar and lifted oxidation with a damp cloth. Don\u2019t use abrasive materials like steel wool or sandpaper to scrub the surface of the aluminum. While this can scrape away oxidation, it also will scratch the surface of the aluminum and make oxidation harder to remove in the future.
