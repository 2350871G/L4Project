            "description": "While no extensions have been reported to be incompatible with Firefox Portable, some extensions will extend the portability of Firefox Portable beyond the defaults. These extensions are:\n\nAdblock Plus - Many computer problems are a result of the ever-increasing greed of the advertising industry. While some advertising agencies, such as Google, are content with plain-text ads, some write software designed to damage your computer, and blocking all ads helps whoever is letting you use their computer, and shows your appreciation for their generosity. By blocking ads, you will prevent unwanted problems from ever loading. FoxyProxy - If you start Firefox Portable on a computer at work or school and it can't access the Internet, yet Internet Explorer can, you need to configure Firefox to use the computer's network proxy. To do this, open Internet Explorer, go to Tools, then Internet Options, click the Connections tab, then click LAN Settings near the bottom. Copy the information to the relevant fields in FoxyProxy and be sure the proxy is enabled. Now Firefox Portable should be able to get on the network. Just disable the proxy when you leave, since it will only work on that network. Gmail Manager - If you don't trust the network you're on, it might be a good idea not to be typing your passwords in. If you still want to check your email, and you use Gmail, this is for you. Set up your accounts on a trusted system, and this extension will securely check, and connect you to your email. Its best feature, of course, is that it will tell you how many unread emails you have. There's a similar one for Yahoo! Mail if you use that."
