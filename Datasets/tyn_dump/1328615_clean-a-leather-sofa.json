    "text": " Removing Debris Remove large debris with a vacuum. Using the vacuum\u2019s hand tool, remove any debris from the sofa. Focus around the creases and folds of the couch.

The brush bristles are soft and less likely to scratch the surface of the sofa. Dust the sofa. Using a feather or microfiber duster, lightly dust the entire surface of the sofa. Be careful to remove all of the debris from the sofa before further cleaning as the debris can scratch the leather. Doing Routine Cleaning Create a homemade solution.

Tap water can contain other chemicals which could be harmful to the leather. Commercial leather cleaner can also be used to cleanse the sofa. Read the label on the product to ensure proper use.
