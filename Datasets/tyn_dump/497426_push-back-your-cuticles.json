It's best to do this first, because after you push back your cuticles they may be a little tender, and nail polish remover might sting. In addition, if you leave old polish on your nails, small chips could get pushed into your nail beds as you're working on your cuticles, potentially leading to an infection. Unless you have acrylic nails or a particular manicure that requires it, you should avoid using nail polish remover with acetone, which can dry out your nails and cuticles."

If you like, you can heat up jojoba or coconut oil and add it to the water for even more moisturized cuticles. A long shower might also soften your cuticles enough to push them back. Alternatively, you can put avocado oil or cuticle oil from a beauty supply store on your cuticles and leave for 2-3 minutes. Be sure to rub on in a circular motion and then soak your hands in a nail dish with warm soapy water. Make sure the cream or oil is still on your cuticles and continue to soak for 5-10 minutes."
