Put on gloves and mix trisodium phosphate (TSP) and water according to the instructions on the box. Dip a sponge in the solution, wring it out, and wipe down each cabinet. Then, wipe down each cabinet with a clean cloth to remove any residue. Be sure to clean the inside and outside of each cabinet."

You'll also want to unscrew any handles, pulls, stops or hinges that might get in the way while you\u2019re painting. This way, you'll be able to work without obstructions. Keep everything together in one place to avoid losing important pieces. Labeling the individual bits of hardware or placing them in separate plastic bags can make it easier to keep track of everything. If you\u2019d also like to use this project as a chance to install new hardware, this would be an opportune time."

Primer will be useful for protecting the cabinet\u2019s underlying materials and getting the paint to hold better. Primers should be specially formulated for use with the type of paint you\u2019re working with. Water-based primers, for example, should be used only with water-based paints.

Mask the countertops as well. Make sure the tape is straight and even to avoid glaring mistakes. Painter\u2019s tape will allow you to establish exact boundaries for your paint job and cover areas that you want to keep clear. Wider tape will give you a greater margin of error and can be useful for painting near walls and trim. If you\u2019d prefer not to remove your cabinet doors prior to painting, fold a piece of painter\u2019s tape over the hinges to keep paint from getting on them. If your bathroom is small, consider painting the drawers and cabinet doors in another space that has better ventilation."

Silky finishes also tend to last longer, as they don\u2019t lose as much shine as time goes on.
