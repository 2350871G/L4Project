Cut the bread in half horizontally and trim the crusts. Take 1 loaf of round, crusty bread, and use a sharp knife to slice it in half horizontally. Trim the top and bottom crusts from the bread to create two large, round slices that are approximately 1 \u00bd inches (3.8 cm) thick. These types of round, crusty bread are sometimes called bread boules, and are often used to serve soups and dips in. It can be difficult to cut a round loaf of bread, so be careful to tuck your fingers under when you're slicing. Spread the mustard onto the bread and cover with cheese. Once the bread is cut, use a butter knife to spread the mustard of your choice over one slice.

        "When both sides of the sandwich are golden brown, remove it from the skillet and place it on a cookie sheet.",

        "Sprinkle the cheese over the bread and add other fillings if desired.",
        "On top of the piece of bread on the cookie sheet, spread 1 \u00bd pounds (680 g) of grated cheddar cheese in an even layer.",

        "Fontina, Gouda, provolone, mozzarella, and Colby are all cheese that melt well.",

        "If you only have smaller oven-safe skillets, use multiple pans to weigh down as much of the focaccia as possible.",
        "Place the sandwich in the oven and bake it until the cheese melts.",
        "With the heavy pan on top of the focaccia, set the baking sheet in the preheated oven.",

        "Brush the cut sides of the baguette with the oil mixture and grill for several minutes.",
        "When you\u2019ve flavored the oil, use a pastry brush to spread it over the cut sides of 1 baguette that\u2019s been sliced in half horizontally.",
        "Place the baguette pieces cut side down in the grill pan, and grill them for approximately 4 minutes, or until they\u2019re toasted.",
