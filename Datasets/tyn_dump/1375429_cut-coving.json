Measure from the bend in the coving to the outside edge of the coving on both the ceiling and wall sides. Measure the length of coving you will need to cover the space on your wall and ceiling. Divide the length to be covered by the length of coving strips that you have. If you require a total of 60 feet (18.3 m) of coving and have coving in 3-foot (.9-m) strips, then you will need at least 20 strips of coving. Ensure that you have a few extra strips of coving."
