    "text": " Using Fabric Dye Choose to use either powder or liquid fabric dye. You can use either type of dye to color your tablecloth. Powder dye requires mixing the dye with liquid before you saturate your fabric, while liquid dye is ready to use. Both are highly pigmented and easy to work with. Fill a large bucket or bin with 2 US gal (7.6 L) of very hot water. Turn on your faucet and let the warm water run for a few minutes to heat up. Then, fill up your container with water. Warm water helps your dye adhere to the fabric. You want your water around 140 \u00b0F (60 \u00b0C). Add 1 cup (236.6 g) of salt for every pound of fabric used. The amount of salt you need depends on the thickness and weight of your particular material. Measure out your salt and pour it into your warm water, then mix it up using a spoon. The salt helps the dye penetrate the fabric and stay permanently. To find out how much your fabric weighs, read the packaging if it's a new tablecloth. If its an existing tablecloth, use an online fabric calculator based on your tablecloth's dimensions. Mix your dye in the bucket or bin as outlined on the packaging. On average, use \u20442  c (120 mL) of dye per pound of fabric. Pour your dye into the container using a measuring cup. Each type of dye will have slightly different directions, so it\u2019s important to read the particular instructions before you pour in your dye. Submerge your tablecloth for 5-20 minutes to dye it all 1 color. Dunk the tablecloth into your bucket or bin, and use a spoon to push it beneath the liquid. This way, all of the fabric gets saturated in the dye. Leave the dye in the solution for 5-20 minutes, as outlined in your directions. Leave your tablecloth in the dye for a longer period of time for a highly saturated, vibrant look. Color only the edges of the fabric using a dowel rod for a dip-dyed look.

If you don\u2019t have a clothesline, you can lay your tablecloth over your porch railing or banister. Using Tie-Dye Mix the colors in a tie dye kit to prepare your dye. Included in these kits are gloves, rubber bands, applicator bottles, and dye pigments. Follow the included instructions regarding how to mix the dyes, as each type is slightly different. In general, you simply fill the bottles with water up to the fill line when you are ready to dye your tablecloth.

Then, turn off the heat and add \u20442  c (120 mL) of vinegar. Slowly add your tablecloth to the pot until it is completely covered. Mix it up, and let the fabric soak for at least 2 hours.

Lower your heat, and simmer your mixture for 15 minutes. Drain the liquid with a strainer, and use the liquid as your dye. Then, let your fabric soak in the dye for at least 2 hours.

        "If you don\u2019t have a clothesline, you can lay your tablecloth over your porch railing or banister.",
        "Using Tie-Dye Mix the colors in a tie dye kit to prepare your dye.",
        "Included in these kits are gloves, rubber bands, applicator bottles, and dye pigments.",
        "Follow the included instructions regarding how to mix the dyes, as each type is slightly different.",
        "In general, you simply fill the bottles with water up to the fill line when you are ready to dye your tablecloth.",
        "You can purchase an at-home tie dye kit from most craft supply stores.",
        "1 kit with 3-4 bottles should be enough dye for 1 tablecloth.",
        "Avoid overfilling the bottles, as you can lose pigment.",
        "Spread out your tablecloth on a clean, flat surface.",
        "When dyeing your tablecloth, it is important to lay the material flat so you can prepare your pattern properly.",
        "If there are creases or wrinkles in it, the inside of the fabric may not get as saturated as the outer areas.",
        "You can lay it on your deck, patio, or large table, for example.",
        "Pinch the middle of the tablecloth and spin your fabric to create a spiral.",
        "With your index middle and thumb, secure the center of the fabric, and start twisting your hand clockwise.",
        "As you do this, use your other hand to guide the fabric.",
        "When you reach the end of the fabric, hold it with both of your hands to keep it tight.",
        "Then, wrap the ball of fabric with 3-4 rubber bands to create 6-8 even sections.",
        "This creates an all-over spiral pattern.",
        "If you are having trouble finding the center, fold the tablecloth in half lengthwise so it\u2019s smaller and easier to work with.",
        "Section off your fabric starting at the center for a bullseye pattern.",
        "Pinch the center with your index finger and thumb, and pull the fabric up.",
        "Smooth the fabric into a solid bundle.",
        "Then, stretch a rubber band over the fabric about 2\u20134 in (5.1\u201310.2 cm) down from the end.",
        "Wrap the rubber band 1-3 times so it is tight.",
        "Continue doing this until you reach the end of your tablecloth.",
        "This creates an evenly-spaced, ring pattern across your tablecloth.",
        "Fold the fabric into evenly-sized pleats to make stripes.",
        "Make vertical folds about 2\u20134 in (5.1\u201310.2 cm) wide starting at the edge of your tablecloth.",
        "Your folds should stack on top of eachother like a fan.",
        "Then, wrap your tablecloth 1-3 times with a rubber band about 2\u20134 in (5.1\u201310.2 cm) from the end.",
        "Continue segmenting your fabric until you reach the other end of the fabric.",
        "This creates horizontal stripes across your tablecloth.",
        "Cover each section of your tablecloth with your tie dye.",
        "You can either dye each section a different color, or you can alternate 2-4 colors to create a pattern.",
        "To do this, squeeze the dye over the fabric in between the rubber banded sections.",
        "Avoid getting your tie dye on other sections.",
        "Make sure you apply the dye to the inside of the bundle so the center of the tablecloth gets covered too.",
        "Let your dye soak inside a plastic bag for 24 hours for best results.",

        "Then, launder your tie-dyed tablecloth in warm water, and let it air dry.",
        "This way, your tablecloth will be highly saturated and colorful.",
        "Dyeing with Natural Ingredients Use turmeric, water, and vinegar to dye your tablecloth yellow.",

        "Let both pots sit for 1 hour with the heat on, and then dump out your vinegar mixture.",
        "Pour the dye over your fabric, and heat the fabric for 15-60 minutes.",
        "If you\u2019d like, you can fold the tablecloth into a small bundle so it\u2019s easier to fit in the pot.",
        "Fold the tablecloth lengthwise 2 times, then alternate your folds to create a square.",
        "After your fabric is folded, wrap rubber bands around it horizontally and vertically to keep it in place.",
        "The vinegar helps your fabric absorb the natural color.",
        "Mix chopped beets and vinegar if you want to make a lavender dye.",

        "Lower your heat, and simmer your mixture for 15 minutes.",
        "Drain the liquid with a strainer, and use the liquid as your dye.",
        "Then, let your fabric soak in the dye for at least 2 hours.",

        "Rinse your fabric with cool water after you dye the tablecloth.",
        "Once your tablecloth reaches your desired color, rinse the material in cool water.",
        "The cool water only removes the excess dye.",

        "Warm water can strip the dye away from your fabric, making your tablecloth a lighter color.",
        "Let your fabric air dry for best results.",
        "Stretch your fabric out on a table, across your patio railing, or on a clean tarp.",
        "Then, let your tablecloth dry completely.",
        "After your fabric dries, you can place it on your table or wash it by itself if you'd like.",
        "Using heat when your tablecloth is first drying can release the natural dye pigment, making your tablecloth look faded more quickly.",
        "After you've let your tablecloth dry completely, then you can use heat on your fabric."
