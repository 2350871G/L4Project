It is also good for pots you have planted in before because it will loosen any dirt. If the pot has no stickers and you can tell for sure it is clean, it may be alright to skip the soak. Although you\u2019ll have to leave the pot to dry at various stages in the process, while it soaks, you can use the time to gather your other supplies and set up your paint area.

The paint will not go on even or stick properly if there is any dirt or debris. Your pots may need a soft brush so you don\u2019t scratch them too much, but if there are any stubborn spots you can switch to a wire brush for extra strength. If you happen to scratch the pot any while brushing it, there\u2019s no need to worry because the paint will cover it and even it out."

If the paint is not dry, new coats will pull the paint off of the pot. You can use a different color for the second coat if you want to give the pot a shaded look.

        "If the paint is not dry, new coats will pull the paint off of the pot.",
        "You can use a different color for the second coat if you want to give the pot a shaded look.",
        "If you do this, you might want to thin the second coat with water so it is a little more see-through.",
        "Finish the paint job with designs.",
        "Another option for further creativity is painting lines, shapes, or pictures on the pot.",
        "If you\u2019ll use the pot for a plant with large foliage that hangs down, you probably don\u2019t want to go into great detail.",
        "This is where you can make the pot as simple or as detailed as you want.",
        "For example, you might want to paint a detailed garden scene or you might want to paint the name of the plant in fancy letters.",
        "Spray the pot with an acrylic sealer.",
        "Acrylic sealer will make sure the paint lasts longer without peeling or cracking.",
        "This is especially helpful if the pot will be outside in the elements.",
        "Wait to put the final seal coat on until all the paint has completely dried.",
        "This is not mandatory, but your paint job will most likely not last as long if you pass on sealing it.",
        "You have lots of options when it come to sealants, but pay special attention if you will put the pot outside because not all sealants are meant for all weather.",
        "Let the pot sit and dry for a few more days before you plant anything in it.",
        "Finished."
