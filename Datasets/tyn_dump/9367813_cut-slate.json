To minimize the amount of dust produced when you cut your slate, soak the slate in water for a minute or two before you cut it. Mark and cut the top of the slate when using power tools. When using power tools, it's more important that the slate lies flat on the surface you're cutting on. In this case, you'll mark the top of the slate. Use a straightedge and a pencil to mark a line.
