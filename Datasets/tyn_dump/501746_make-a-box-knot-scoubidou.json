Take the ends of the horizontal strand and cross them over your finger. Bring them to the opposite ends. Weave the vertical strands through the horizontal. Let the vertical ends cross over your finger and under the horizontal strand on the farther side. Pull all four ends to tighten into a knot.  Continuing With a Square Stitch Make two loops over the center with the horizontal strand. Bend the strand nearest opposite you to make one loop. Bend the other strand nearest to you to make another loop opposite you. Pass one vertical string over the horizontal loop nearest it. Then thread it through the second loop farthest it. Pass the second vertical string over the horizontal loop nearest it. Then thread it through the second loop farthest it. Pull all four strings together.
