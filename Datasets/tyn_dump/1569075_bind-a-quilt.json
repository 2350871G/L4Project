As you approach each corner, stop stitching the same distance from the edge as your seam allowance. Miter the corner and continue sewing along the last edge. Finish sewing the first side. When you reach the place where you began binding the quilt, trim the tail, leaving just enough fabric to overlap the starting place by about four inches. Fold the fabric under at a diagonal and tuck the other tail at the beginning of the binding underneath. Continue stitching along the edge of the quilt and sew over your original seam by an inch or so. Backstitch and trim your thread. Turn the quilt over and bind the other side.
