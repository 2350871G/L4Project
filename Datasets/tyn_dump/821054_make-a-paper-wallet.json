    "text": " Folding a Simple Money Pouch Start with a piece of 8 1\u20442 by 11-inch (22 by 28-cm) paper. Double-sided scrapbooking paper will work the best, but you can use other paper too. If the paper is too big, you should cut it down to 8 \u20442 by 11 inches (22 by 28 cm). If you are using double-sided scrapbooking, make sure that the side you want to be on the outside is facing down. Fold the paper into eighths. Begin by folding the paper in half widthwise to make a crease. Unfold the paper, then fold both of the edges to the middle. Crease the edges, then unfold them. Fold the paper lengthwise, crease it, then unfold it. Cut 1-inch (2.5-cm) slits into the lengthwise creases. Rotate the paper so that you have a center horizontal crease and 3 vertical creases. Cut 1-inch (2.5-cm) slits into the top and bottom vertical creases. Fold the left edge towards the last vertical crease. Keep the paper oriented with the 3 vertical creases and 1 horizontal crease. Take the left edge of the paper, and bring it towards the last vertical crease. Fold the paper in half widthwise. Sharpen the crease on the left side of the paper first. Next, bring the top and bottom narrow edges together, and sharpen the crease with your fingernail. Cut off the bottom-left corner. Make sure that your paper is properly oriented first. There should be a solid fold along the bottom edge, and 2 folded edges along the left side. The right side should have 2 layers of paper, and the top should have 4 layers. Once the paper is oriented, cut the bottom-left corner off. How much you cut off of the bottom corner is up to you. Anywhere between 1 \u20442 and 2 inches (3.8 and 5.1 cm) would be good, however. Unfold the paper, then fold down every other flap. When you unfold the paper, you'll have a diamond-shaped hole. Rotate the paper so that the hole is on the right side. Starting on the left side of the paper, fold down every 1-inch (2.5-cm) flap created by the 1-inch (2.5-cm) slits that you cut earlier. You need to fold the top and bottom flaps. Create a gatefold in the paper, then fold the paper in half. Fold the left and right side edges towards the center vertical crease to create a gatefold. Next, hold the paper in half along the center vertical crease to create a skinny rectangle. Sharpen the creases with your fingernail to make them nice and neat. Tuck the flaps into the wallet. Flip the wallet over so that you can see the diamond-shaped hole. Fold the remaining side flaps down. Crease them with your fingernail, then tuck them into the wallet. At this point, you can secure the flaps with a glue stick or a strip of double-sided tape. Fold the wallet in half and use it. Flip the wallet so that the diamond shape is facing you. Fold the narrow ends of the wallet together so that the triangle is enclosed inside the wallet. Sharpen the crease, then unfold the wallet. Slide your credit cards and gift cards into the wallet through the diamond-shaped hole. You can also fold paper money a few times, and tuck it inside too. Folding an Origami-Style Wallet Fold an 8 1\u20442 by 11-inch (22 by 28-cm) sheet of paper in half widthwise. Despite the name, this wallet does not use origami paper, but rather standard printer paper. Fold the paper in half widthwise or hamburger style. You can use colored printer paper, but avoid cardstock, as it is too thick. Unfold the paper, flip it over, and create a gatefold. Open the paper back up so that it is a rectangle again. Flip the paper over, so that you can see the back. Fold the left and right narrow edges towards the crease running down the middle of the paper. This is known as a \"gatefold.\" Fold the right side edge inside the right flap. Open up the right side of the paper to reveal a new crease. Fold the right side edge towards this new crease, then fold the flap back down, just like it used to be. At the end of this step, the left flap will still reach the center crease, but the right flap will only reach it half way. Flip the paper over, then fold the top and bottom edge up by 1/2-inch (1.3-cm). Flip the paper over so that you can see the smooth front first. Make sure that the central fold line is oriented vertically. Next, fold the top and bottom edges down by 1/2 to 1 inch 1/2-inch (1.3 to 2.5-cm). This will determine the length of your wallet. Paper money varies in size from country to country. Check the wallet against your own money. The wallet should be longer than your money. Fold down the top and bottom corners of the wider flap. The top and bottom folded edges have a narrow flap and a wide flap. Take the corner of the wide flap along the top edge of the paper, and fold it down. Repeat with the wide flap along the bottom edge of the paper. You are folding the corners all the way down to the rest of the paper. They will create 45-degree angles. Fold the wallet along the center fold line. Make sure that you are folding it so that the folded top and bottom edges are on the inside. You will get a rectangle that is smooth on 1 side, and has a pocket on the other. Tuck the edges of the wallet into the folded flaps. Turn the wallet so that the side with the pocket is facing you. Bring the flaps with the folded corners to the front. Slide the edges of the pocket side of the wallet into these flaps. Fold the wallet in half widthwise to close it. Make sure that the pocket side of the wallet is facing you. Bring the 2 narrow edges together, and flatten the wallet to fold it. Run your fingernail up and down along the crease to sharpen it. Tuck your money and credit cards into the wallet. Use the small pocket to hold small items, such as gift cards or credit cards. Use the large pocket along the top edge of the wallet to hold paper bills. If you want to \"lock\" the wallet while it's shut, tuck the front panel into the flap on the back panel.
