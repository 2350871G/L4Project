Doing so may cause irreparable damage to the metal wheel beneath the tire, and could even cause you to lose control of the vehicle. Press down on the accelerator lightly, or, if possible, idle along until you find a suitable place to pull over. Traveling at high speeds will just damage your wheel faster, as higher speeds will subject the wheel to greater forces, without the tire to protect it from bumps and debris. If you\u2019re headed downhill, let the car coast gently on its own momentum with your foot poised on the brake."
