Stir the resin together in a container using a stick, making slow circular movements to avoid creating too many air bubbles.Refer to the instructions for how much resin to use depending on the size of your silicone mold. Each layer of resin will likely use 12\u201320 ounces (340\u2013570 g) of resin. Use clear resin if you want to be able to see the materials or objects through the resin. Resin has a strong odor and can be toxic, so work in a space with good air ventilation."
