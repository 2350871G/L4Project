To do this, you\u2019ll need to trace each section of the tunic on large paper. A simple tunic will have just two parts; the front and the back. If you want to add sleeves, you\u2019ll need to trace those too. While tracing, use pushpins to hold the garment in place.

Use a measuring tape to measure the fullest part around your bust, true waist, and hips. Then measure the length of your back (from the neck to the waistline), the width of the chest, width of the back, and distance from the neck to the shoulder bone. Then use these measurements to draw the pattern on a large piece of paper. Make sure you are standing nice and straight while taking these measurements.

So if you\u2019re a beginner, consider choosing a thicker fabric, such as knit or double gauze. Use your pattern as a guide to picking the right fabric.
