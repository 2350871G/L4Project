                    "description": "The simplest way to collect carbon dioxide is to react calcium carbonate (or limestone chips) with hydrochloric acid. First, pour 20 mL of HCl into a conical flask. Add a spoonful of calcium carbonate (or limestone chips) to the HCL. When the reaction starts, cover the conical flask with a bung and delivery tube: you will collect the gas through the delivery tube and into an upturned test tube (which is immersed in bowl of water). If the water in the test tube is displaced, then gas is being collected. You can continue to collect the gas for as long as the reaction occurs. For classroom demonstrations, you only need a small amount of hydrochloric acid, which is diluted to 1 M; a 2 M concentration works best, but should be used with extra care because it's a strong acid. The equation is: CaCO3(s) + 2HCl(aq) ==> CaCl2(aq) + H2O(l) + CO2(g). Be very careful when working with hydrochloric acid \u2013 wear gloves, a lab coat, and protective goggles, and do not let the acid touch your skin! It's best to only perform this reaction if you have access to a lab environment."

A teaspoon will result in a fully saturated solution, whether you use a gallon jar or a smaller container. Fill the jar with distilled water. It's best to use distilled water for this experiment, as it will give you a purer solution. Put a lid on the jar. Shake the solution vigorously for 1-2 minutes, then let it stand for 24 hours.
