You should wind up with approximately 2 tablespoons (30 g) of grated onion, as well as some juice, which you can discard. If you don\u2019t have a grater, you can finely dice the onion with a knife.

Shape each bit of the meat into a patty that\u2019s approximately 1-inch (25.4 mm) thick. If you\u2019re having trouble forming uniform patties for your burgers, take the lid from an old peanut butter or other jar, line it with plastic wrap, and use it as a mold to form a perfect patty."

Turn the heat to medium-high, and add 1 tablespoon (approximately 30 ml) of olive oil or canola oil. Heat the oil until it starts to shimmer, which typically takes 1 to 2 minutes. Instead of a skillet or frying pan, you can also use a griddle to cook the turkey burgers. If you prefer, you can use a non-stick cooking spray in place of the oil.

Turkey burgers are cooked all the way through when their internal temperature reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit (approximately 74 degrees Celsius).

If you are a fan of cheese on your burgers, place a slice of the cheese of your choice on the burger about 1 minute before it will be done. You can use any type of cheese that you like on your turkey burger, but American, cheddar, swiss, and gouda are tasty options. Instead of sliced cheese, you can sprinkle shredded cheese on your burgers. It usually melts more quickly than slices, though, so you can wait until 30 seconds before you\u2019re going to take the burgers out of the pan to add it."

Go the traditional route with ketchup, or mix things up with a little mustard. You can even go with a combination of both if you prefer. Use your favorite condiment or burger sauce as a finishing touch to your tasty turkey burger.
