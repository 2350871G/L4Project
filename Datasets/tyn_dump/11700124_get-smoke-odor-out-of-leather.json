Fill a bag or open container with cat litter and place it near the leather item. After a couple days, the smoke odor should be gone! If the smoke smell is still lingering after several days, dump out the used cat litter and replace it with fresh cat litter. Purchase cat litter from your local pet supply store or big box store."

If you have a smaller item that smells or you\u2019d rather not apply the baking soda directly to the leather, fill a plastic or paper bag with baking soda and place the bag on or in the leather item. Leave the bag filled with baking soda on or in the leather item for at least 1-2 days so it has time to properly absorb the smell. For example, place a bag of baking soda in a purse or wrapped in a leather jacket."
