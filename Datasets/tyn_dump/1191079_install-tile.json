Cement board will help waterproof your structure and it will also be much more resistant to warping, which helps to prevent cracks. Score the cement board and then snap it cut out the pieces that you need. Screw it down along the edges (every couple inches) and also at the center (3-4 evenly spaced locations should do). Make sure to stagger the joints between different rows of the cement board. This will prevent large cracks from appearing over time. If attaching the cement board to a subfloor, you will need to apply mortar before lying down each panel, and then screwing it into place.

If when you lift up the tiles you see only lines of mortar on the tile, then the mortar has dried out too much or the bed is too thin and the height of the ridges must be increased.
