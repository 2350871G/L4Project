Another option is to place a Phillips-head screwdriver in the anchor. Tap it gently with a hammer. Once it is pushed slightly into the wall, apply joint compound over it to smooth out the hole. Cutting the Collar Out Push a single utility razor blade under the collar. The blade should be sharp and flush with the wall, with the blade facing down. Do not push the blade toward the wall, or you could damage the surface of the drywall. This method works well on plastic anchors, not metal ones. Saw the collar off the anchor. Rock the razor blade back and forth, to slowly cut through collar. Once the collar breaks off, discard it. Push the anchor through the wall with a screw driver. Once the collar has been removed, you should be able to push the anchor through the wall without damaging it. Press a screwdriver into the hole where the anchor is held. It should fall out on the other side of the wall. Once the hole is clear you can proceed to patch it up, so no one will ever be able to know the anchor was there.
