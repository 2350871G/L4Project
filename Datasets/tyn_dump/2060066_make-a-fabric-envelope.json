You will need to decide upon the size of your envelope based on how much fabric you have and how big you want your envelope to be. For a regular card-sized envelope, cut your 2 scraps into 10 by 10-inch (25.4 by 25.4-cm) pieces with sharp pair of fabric scissors or a rotary cutter, plastic ruler and mat. For a rectangular business-sized envelope, cut your 2 scraps into rectangular 8.5 by 10-inch (21.6 by 25.4-cm) shapes. You will fold this sized envelope differently, by folding it in thirds. Experiment with different sizes. If you have a specific item that you want to place in the envelope, measure and cut the envelope fabric so that it is 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) larger in width and 3/4 to 1 inch (1.9 to 2.54 cm) taller in height."
