        "Since your camera will be pointed directly at the sun for a long period of time, it\u2019s a good idea to start with the lowest native aperture setting and work your way up incrementally as needed.",
        "On most higher-end models, somewhere between f/5.6 and f/8 will be the sweet spot.",
        "The amount of light is also known as \u201cexposure,\u201d and it can be the difference between a photo that\u2019s crisp and clear and one that\u2019s washed out or oversaturated.",
        "You may have less (or sometimes no) control over the exposure with an inexpensive digital camera.",
        "Adjust the shutter speed to its fastest value.",
        "Shutter speed determines how clearly defined the action in a photograph is.",
        "Since your goal is to capture the eclipse as accurately as possible, a high shutter speed is best.",
        "At 1/4000 or 1/8000, every glowing wisp and dazzling streak of the corona will be plainly visible.",
        "With a high (fast) shutter speed, the camera\u2019s sensor is only exposed to light for a split second, effectively freezing an image.",
        "Lower (slow) shutter speeds let the light linger, which can result in a blurry, smeared effect.",
        "It may be necessary to alter your shutter speed to successfully track the moon\u2019s progress as the light grows faint.",
        "Practice shooting with the settings you've worked out.",
        "You\u2019ll be juggling some technical and potentially temperamental settings, made even more frustrating by constant changes in lighting and atmospheric conditions.",
        "Make sure you take some time to familiarize yourself with what each feature does before the day of your shoot.",
        "That way, you can be sure that you'll walk away with some dazzling images and not an endless string of washed out black frames.",
        "Carry out a few sessions in a low-light setting, like a dark room or moonlit night, to mimic the conditions of shooting an eclipse as closely as possible.",
        "Perform a dry run of each of the techniques you'll be using during the event, including altering your shutter speed, cycling between different exposures, and removing and replacing the solar filter.",
        "Getting the Perfect Shot Shoot at many different exposures.",
        "The trickiest part of shooting a solar eclipse is keeping up with the ever-shifting light.",
        "In the seconds before and after totality, \u201cbracketing\u201d your exposure will maximize your chances of getting true-to-life light levels.",
        "One simple way to do this is to increase or decrease your shutter speed\u2014the longer the shutter is open, the more light the lens will take in, and vice versa.",
        "More sophisticated cameras sometimes have an auto-bracketing feature, which will allow you to set the shutter speed to predetermined \u201cstops,\u201d or degrees of exposure.",
        "Take some time to figure out your preferred exposure settings a few days before the actual phenomenon by practicing on the unobstructed sun.",
        "Once you've got them how you want them, leave them alone to make sure they stay just as they are.",
        "Turn off the flash.",
        "If you\u2019re shooting with a standard digital camera or phone camera, double check that the flash is completely disabled (not on \u201cauto\u201d).",
        "That way, an artificial secondary light source won\u2019t interfere with the natural light peeking out from behind the moon.",
        "The sun itself will provide plenty of illumination, even while it\u2019s obscured, so there\u2019s no need to worry about your shot being too dark.",
        "Even the brightest flash will be too weak to compete with the sunlight, but it\u2019s possible for it to affect the look of your immediate surroundings on film.",
        "Inadvertent flash could spoil the ambient lighting for other photographers nearby.",
        "Remove the solar filter during totality.",
        "As mentioned, the fleeting moments when the moon is hiding the sun are the only time it will be safe to shoot without the protection of your solar filter.",
        "This is when you\u2019ll be rewarded with the most stunning photos.",
        "Remember to keep the entire radius of the eclipse in the frame to include all of the little details and tricks of light.",
        "Be prepared to remove and replace your solar filter quickly so you don\u2019t waste a moment.",
        "Totality typically only lasts around a minute.",
        "Shooting totality with the solar filter still in place will just result in a dim, unimpressive approximation of the eclipse\u2019s true glory.",
        "Don\u2019t miss out on viewing the event for yourself.",
        "While photographing a solar eclipse can be a fun and exciting project, nothing compares to seeing it with your own 2 eyes.",
        "Whether you\u2019re putting together a spread for a nature magazine or just shooting for your own enjoyment, be sure to pause for few moments to take it all in.",
        "It may be decades before you get another chance.",
        "Get the sun centered in your viewfinder early so you can step away and get a firsthand look.",
        "Don\u2019t waste time struggling with an uncooperative camera.",
        "If you happen to experience technical difficulties, just set your equipment aside and enjoy the show."
