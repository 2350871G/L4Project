Large segments of mangosteen fruit usually contain a seed, so watch out for these while you\u2019re eating. Smaller segments are usually seedless. Mangosteen seeds are white when the fruit is fresh, but as the fruit ages, the seeds will start to turn brown, affecting the color of the fruit. You can use this to gauge the freshness of the mangosteen. Yellow sections of mangosteen flesh will be very bitter. Whole mangosteen can be stored at room temperature for several days. Once you cut open the shell, though, place any remaining fruit in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week. Serving suggestions: Add mangosteen to sweet treats like jam and ice cream, or use the whole segments as a sweet salad topping!"
