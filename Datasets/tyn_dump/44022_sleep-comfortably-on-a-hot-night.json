Place three to four tablespoons of dish soap in a resealable Ziploc bag. Place it in the freezer. The soap will not harden, and it will hold the cold temperature longer than ice and/or the blue ice packs.

You can also Make a Rice Sock. Place it in the freezer and leave it there for at least two hours. When you turn in, bring the bag with you to use as a cool compress.
