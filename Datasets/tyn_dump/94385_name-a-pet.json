Just because it is at the time you name it, does not mean in the future it will not loose/gain weight, so don't name a pet Boney or Chubs. Also avoid names that might alienate people, such as \"Cujo,\" which could remind others of the killer dog from the movie, \"Cujo.\" It's also smart to nix names that are tongue twisters and that can be confused with training cues or everyday words. \"Mo,\" for example, can be confused with \"no,\" \"Tom\" can be confused with \"come,\" and \"Trey\" can be confused with \"stay.\""
