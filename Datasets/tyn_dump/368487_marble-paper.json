To make enough alum for several dozen sheets of paper, stir 1 tbsp (15 mL) alum into 1\u00bd cups (360 mL) warm water until completely dissolved, at least two minutes. Buy pure aluminum sulfate from an art supply store or online. Do not use alum sold as a spice. This is usually a related chemical compound that may damage the paper. Keep alum out of reach of children. It is not dangerous to handle, but can dry the skin and irritate the nose when inhaled. Wear gloves or wash hands after handling, and avoid inhaling the powder."

Most brands and colors will sink, in which case you should add marbling gall to that container of paint. Vegetable oil is a cheap substitute, but may leave your paper a little greasy. Stir in one drop at a time, testing in between, until a drop of paint float on the surface and spreads out slowly. Stir in more if the drop rapidly spreads to more than 3 inches (7.5 cm). Old-fashioned ox gall will not work with acrylic paints. Use a detergent-based marbling gall that does not contain animal products. This is also sold as surfactant or dispersant. Test each color separately, and test before each marbling session. Changes in temperature and humidity can change the amount of gall required."
