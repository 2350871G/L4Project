To figure out how many cylinders to make and prepare, ask a project manager, supervisor, client, or inspector on the job site. Set up the cylinder molds. Place all of them with the opening up on a flat, even surface. Keep all of your equipment easily accessible so that you can readily use it. Making the Concrete Cylinders Scoop concrete into each cylinder mold. Using the concrete scoop (or a small shovel if a scoop is not available), scoop concrete into the cylinder mold. Put the scoop into the mold. Rotate your hand clockwise as the concrete falls into the mold. Then fill the mold halfway.

It is essential that the concrete is even and level with the edges of the mold. If it is not even, it may not fit properly in the compression test machine and not be used. Finishing the Cylinders Finish the surface. Using the handheld float, carefully and slowly run it across the surface of the mold. As you keep doing this, it will create a smooth surface. It is helpful to get the float damp before doing this to help create a smooth surface. Place a cap on the cylinders. Make sure they are on all the way to prevent moisture from escaping, and that they will not fall off during transport. Curing the Cylinders Wash any equipment used. The concrete will get stuck on equipment used so they must be washed immediately after use to keep them clean. It is best when a hose is available, if it is not use the water in the bucket to rinse the material of equipment. If there is a large amount of concrete on the outside of the cylinder molds wipe it off. Make sure the information written on it is not covered. Move the cylinders to safe location.
