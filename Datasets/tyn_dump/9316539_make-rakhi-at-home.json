Firmly press it onto the upward facing side of the other circle (the side that the ribbon is glued to). Glue gemstones to the ribbon with fabric glue. You can also use tiny decorative mirrors. Glue the decorations to the top side of the ribbon. Making Rakhi with Silk Thread Hold the end of a thread between your thumb and pointer finger. Use silk thread to make soft, vibrant rakhi. Wrap the thread around three of your fingers about twenty times. Wrapping it around your pointer finger, middle finger, and ring finger will be easiest. Continue to hold the end of the thread between your thumb and pointer finger as you wrap the thread. Slide the looped bundle of thread off your fingers when you\u2019re finished. Wrap the thread around the middle of the looped thread. Wrap it around several times and then tie a knot to hold the thread in place. Pull the knot tight.

Cut at the point of each loop that\u2019s furthest away from the knot in the center. After you cut the loops, you\u2019ll have a bunch of thread ends on each side of the knot.

When you\u2019re done, the fanned out threads should be flat and make a full circle. This will be the amulet for your rakhi. If you want the amulet to look more full, make a second one and glue it on top of the first one. Decorate one side of the thread. Use fabric glue to apply decorative gemstones and beads to the thread. Work outward from the center of the thread. Don\u2019t cover all of the silk thread with decorations. You want some of it to show through your design. Cut a 6-12 inch (15.2-30.5 cm) piece of ribbon. The ribbon should be long enough for you to tie around the wrist of whoever you\u2019re giving your rakhi to. Choose a color ribbon that matches or complements the thread you used. Glue the back of the thread to the middle of the ribbon with fabric glue. The backside of the thread is the side without decorations on it. Make a line of glue down the middle of the backside of the thread and firmly press the ribbon onto it. Decorate the ribbon. Glue decorative gemstones, beads, or mirrors to the top of the ribbon with fabric glue. Finished. ",
