The glove should start out beside the child's body. When the ball arrives, they can then push it forward to catch the ball. This lets them see their hand position and the ball at the same time. At first, kids will have a difficult time doing this, but encourage them as often as possible. It's for their own safety. Most kids won't have the strength yet to do this comfortably, so it'll take them a while to learn. Be patient. Play a game of catch. Any parent can help their child learn how to catch. Lob the ball to them and watch their technique. Adults are the best partners for this exercise since they aren't as likely to make errant throws. If you're teaching a team of kids, you can let the kids throw to one another. Start with low throws and move onto pop-ups when you feel like the kids are ready. If you let kids throw to one another, assign an adult to chase down loose balls. Give the kids a few extra balls so they don't have to wait. Teaching Throwing Techniques Get them to point their shoulder towards the target. Have every kid line up in front of you. Each child should plant their throwing foot behind them. Then, they should turn their bodies so the opposite shoulder points directly at the target. Give them a demonstration before letting them throw. Anything makes a good throw recipient, including baskets, cones, or other adults. Instruct kids to lift their throwing elbow. Their arms need to raise up to shoulder-height. Next, have them bring their throwing arms behind their heads. Tell them \u201cyour elbow points at your target like a big arrow.\u201d Have them shuffle forward before throwing the ball. Have the kids step forward twice before making the throw. Remind them again and again to \u201cmove their feet.\u201d Step forward with the front foot, then follow it with the back foot. Repeat it a second time. After this, the back foot stays planted firmly under the throwing arm. Tell the kids that \u201cYou don't throw the ball with your arm.\u201d Although it isn't completely true, it shows them that legs are important for strong, accurate throws. Snap the arm forward to throw the ball. To throw the ball, the elbow of the glove arm pulls back while the throwing arm snaps forward. Watch the kids as they release the ball. Make sure their throwing hand is above their elbow. If they don't do this, they'll throw sideways. As you teach them this technique, use the phrase \u201cshuffle, shuffle, pull, snap.\u201d It helps them put the foot and arm movements together. Stop kids from arcing the ball when throwing. At first, some kids throw the ball high in the air. Correct this before it becomes a habit. Gently remind them that fast throws stay level with the ground. Go back and practice the mechanics of a good throw to encourage them not to arc the ball. One exercise for this is to have kids throw bouncing balls to a catch partner. It's also a great opportunity to practice fielding. Practice throwing at a target. Inventing a game is a great way to let the kids have fun while practicing their throwing technique. Set a bucket or laundry basket on the ground. From a distance, have the kids take turns trying to bounce balls into the basket. Assign points, such as five points for hitting the side of the basket and ten for hitting the center.",
