Switch to 150-grit for the second half, then a 120-grit belt when you\u2019ve gotten to the line in order to smooth it out.

Remember you can take away more door but you cannot put back what you\u2019ve already removed, so sand carefully. The planer works faster than the belt sander. It also will make larger sawdust that you are less likely to breathe and easier to cleanup, because it does not float so far away in the air. You can also use the planer on the door, without removing it, if it sticks on the top side or the side of the knob. If you\u2019re sanding the latch edge of the door, be sure to first remove the latch hardware. You may have to use a sharp chisel to dig out the latch hole so it doesn\u2019t protrude from the door after planing. If it sticks out a bit, you can often sand or plane it down in place."
