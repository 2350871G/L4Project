Find the dial located on the front side of the cleaner, next to the tank. The dial will have settings for light, normal, and heavy cleanings. Depending on how dirty your carpeting is, select the correct setting and adjust it as you go. Turn the tools dial to the floor cleaning option. The tools dial is the large one on top of the water tank. Spin the dial until the marked arrow on it points down, towards the floor cleaning option. Your machine is now loaded and ready to go. Cleaning the Carpet Flip on the power and heater buttons. Plug the power cord into a nearby outlet, then locate the buttons on the cleaner's back.
