    "text": " Creating and Transferring Your Design Create a template on a sheet of paper. You can draw the design directly onto the paper itself, or you can find an image on the computer and print it out instead. Make sure that the lines are dark, otherwise they won't be visible behind the parchment paper. If you want to make a card, draw a straight line down the middle of the page. Place your outside design on the left, and the inside design on the right. Tape a sheet of parchment paper over your template. Place the template onto a flat surface and tape down the edges. Set the parchment paper on top, and tape down the edges as well. If you're having trouble seeing the lines, remove the parchment paper, and trace over them with a black pen.
