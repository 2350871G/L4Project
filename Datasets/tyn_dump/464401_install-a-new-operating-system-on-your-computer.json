Operating systems have varying system requirements, so if you have an older computer, make sure that you can handle a newer operating system. Most Windows installations require at least 1 GB of RAM, and at least 15-20 GB of hard disk space. Also, your CPU needs to be powerful enough to run the OS you want to run. Make sure that your computer can accommodate this. If not, you may need to install an older operating system, such as Windows XP. Linux operating systems typically don't require as much space and computing power as Windows operating systems. The requirements vary depending on the distribution you choose (Ubuntu, Fedora, Mint, etc. )."
