    "text": " Using a Standard Piece of Paper Fold the piece of paper in half. Make sure you're folding so the page is wider rather than longer (hamburger fold). Cut out a rectangle. On the edge where you made the fold cut a long and skinny rectangle. Leave about an inch on the page. Make the initial cut. Start on the inch stub from the previous cutout on the left side. Cut upwards towards the edge that hasn't been cut. Stop once you're about an inch away from the edge. Flip the paper. Now flip the paper over and start your incision from the edge that is loose. Repeat whatever the width of the initial strip was for this strip. Do the same method as before. Stop about an inch from the edge of the page. Alternate cuts till the end. Continue flipping the page after each cut until you've reached the other side of the paper. Unfold the paper. Carefully unfold your paper and you should have a flimsy ring that you can fit your body through. If you had any strips that were too thin, it could turn out extra flimsy. Practice a few times before trying to impress anyone. Passing Through an Index Card Fold the card in half. For the index card, you'll need to fold it hotdog style, or longways. Cut initial slits. From the folded edge, make two initial incisions on the left and right sides. Leave a little bit less than an inch for the index card's strips. Remove the center. Starting from one of the slits, cut parallel to the folded edge. You'll want to make the cut a little less than an inch down from the folded edge. Flip and cut. Starting from the unfolded edge, cut upwards towards the rectangle you just removed. Again, you'll want to space these slits a little under an inch. Flip and repeat.
