Pants that are too tight make it difficult to sit or squat, which makes your crotch measurements too short. Measure from the front inseam to the waist in order to find the front rise.

It's best to put on the pants and sit in a chair so you can see how the curve of your hip affects the crotch depth. Measure the back rise and add it to the front measurement to find the crotch length. Flip the pants over and smooth wrinkles from the crotch. Pull the measuring tape from the crotch inseam up to the top of the back waistband. Then, add this number to the front rise number to get the crotch length. For example, if your front rise measurement is 13 inches (33 cm) and the back rise is 15 inches (38 cm), your crotch length measurement is 28 inches (71 cm). Take your measurements twice and double-check them. It's easy to make a mistake when you're taking the measurement and writing it down, so ensure you wrote the right number. Do both measurements again and double-check them against the measurements you wrote. This is especially important if you'll be using the measurements to cut fabric for a pair of pants.",
