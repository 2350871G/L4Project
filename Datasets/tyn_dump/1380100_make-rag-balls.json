Always snip in line with the grain of your fabric. In other words, look carefully at the fabric, determine which way the fibers run, and cut in the same direction. This ensures that your fabric will tear easily and evenly. Grasp the fabric on either side of the snip and pull it apart. Cotton, in particular, will tear easily along the grain.

You can tear all the way through the edge of the fabric, but you'll end up with a pile of strips that you have to knot or sew together. If you stop 1 inch away from the edge, you can create 1 long strip of fabric from any square or rectangular piece.
