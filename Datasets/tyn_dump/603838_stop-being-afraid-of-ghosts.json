Fear can be a helpful feeling as it often alerts us to danger; but other times, fear becomes an automatic response to fear of the unknown. This feeling can make situations appear worse than they really are. So ask yourself if there is really a ghost or if you are just afraid of the unknown. Ask yourself, \u201cWhat am I actually afraid of?\u201d Pick apart your fear by determining if you are actually in danger, or if your fear of the unknown is getting the better of you."

Even if you\u2019ve never experienced a ghostly encounter, your mind has a way of pulling together all of the worst images possible to make you afraid.

Calm an overactive imagination by watching less television. TV plays a major part in what we think about on a daily basis. By limiting the amount of movies and TV watched, you can stop buying into the false sense of reality created by media. At a minimum, limit the amount of ghost-themed TV you watch. Try meditation to learn to calm an active mind. By concentrating on different thoughts, objects, or chants, you can learn how to focus your mind and block out unwanted thoughts."
