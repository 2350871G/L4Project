Fasten off the body. Cut the yarn, leaving a 2-inch (5-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to knot off the work, then weave any excess yarn into the back of the project. This step completes the body of the fish. You should have a standard round dishcloth at this point. Work the fishtail. Choose any point along the outer perimeter of the fish body and tie on the yarn for your tail. Attach the yarn to the hook using a slipknot. Work one single crochet into each of the next nine spaced to form a foundation for the tail. Chain three, then turn the work before continuing.
