The abdomen of a garden spider is egg-shaped and slightly shiny, which helps when trying to find them in direct sunlight. A female abdomen will be black with patches of bright yellow, whereas males have patches of pale yellow coloration. Note if the front body section of the spider has short, silvery hairs.

Check for these with a magnifying glass (or camera with a zoom function), but be careful not to concentrate the sun's rays on the spider and burn it.

You can often find their webs built on trellises and on fences around the house, and they are abundant in natural areas too. Garden spiders often like to build their webs in areas of tall grass and foliage, as the grass provides a natural buffer and hiding spot. Identify its circular, orb-like web with a zig-zag pattern. Garden spiders spin their webs in large, circular spirals often with a thick strand of silk that resembles a zig-zag going directly through the middle. This is an indication that you have a garden spider in your yard, but there are other types of spiders that make their webs in a similar fashion.

Identifying Other Spiders in your Garden Recognize a cross orb-weaver by its pyramid-shaped abdomen with a white cross. The cross orb-weaver is sometimes mistaken for a garden spider as it has a similar coloring, but the shape of the cross orb-weaver's abdomen, as well as the white stripe coloration on its body, differentiates it. Its web is circular and spiraling, much like the garden spider's web. Identify a grass spider by its funnel-like web and brown striped legs. A grass spider is a common spider that makes its web in a funnel shape. Their webs are typically low to the ground, which can indicate that it belongs to a grass spider and not a garden spider. The grass spider has black and white spots on its abdomen and brown-striped legs. Their bites are slightly venomous but do not cause any damage to people.

The cobweb spider's web is erratic and patternless and is easily destroyed by the wind, which is why they are usually found in corners and out of the elements.
