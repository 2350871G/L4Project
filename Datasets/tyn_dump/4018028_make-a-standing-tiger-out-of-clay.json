If you create it on a bumpy surface, the tiger might look bumpy or some parts smaller than the other, for example, the head is bumpy or one leg is bigger than the other. A flat space will help you make your clay tiger comfortably. Start with a big piece of orange clay. Roll it into a ball. Shape it into a rectangular prism. Round the edges to help it look like a tiger's body. Roll a smaller piece of orange clay into a ball. This will be the head. Stick the head at the end of the body with a toothpick.

Roll two small yellow balls of clay and add them to the bottom (not all the way at the bottom) of the head. Poke small holes in them. Roll another small ball of yellow clay, and add them under the two muzzles, in the middle. You will see a mouth form. Roll two small orange pieces of clay into two balls for the ears.
