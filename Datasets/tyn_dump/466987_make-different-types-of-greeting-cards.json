    "text": " Steps Get a sheet of any writing material, preferably that thin cardboard, but coloured paper or thick cardboard will do. Fold it in half or in quarters, however you want your card. Write your message on the front with a pencil, pen, coloured pen or marker. Usually a joke, or if you're going to a themed party, make the card themed too. For example, if you were going to a princess party, you wouldn't write on the front, \"Laze around and have a few movies tonight!\" or something to that effect. Open up your card and write your message.  Now you have your Birthday, Valentine's Day, Thank you,or any other card. Just change the messages for a different type! Pop Up Cards Take the cardboard and fold in directly in half.  Take a pair of scissors and cut two parallel slits in the middle, but leaving a two centimetre gap in between where you haven't cut.  Open up your card and finding the slits, hold your fingers on the back of the card. Push the gap in the middle forward so that you have a neat little half-square. Close your card and crease the end. It should have a square on the side. Test the card. Now when you open your card the rectangle should pop up. On another piece of paper, make a message or a character to pop up. Cut out your character/message and glue it onto the front rectangle. Wait until it dries, then close your card again. Get another piece of thin cardboard and fold it in half the same way you folded the other one. Put it to the other one and making sure it is exactly meeting at the corners and sides, glue it on. Write your messages for the front and the inside and decorate it how you like. Now you have a pop-up card!",
