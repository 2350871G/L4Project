You might even consider having a competition with friends for the \"best towel\". Take photos of everyone, including the winners. For people who don't get the significance of your towel, let them know why you have it. You might also explain that a towel is a significant psychological tool, as outlined in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."
