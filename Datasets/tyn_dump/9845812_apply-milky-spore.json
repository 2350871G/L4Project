If you can\u2019t apply the powder in the early fall, aim for applying it during the summer. Apply the powder anytime during the year, as long as the soil is at least 65 \u00b0F (18 \u00b0C). To check the temperature of the soil, stick a metal thermometer roughly 3 inches (7.6 cm) deep into the soil. If the soil is below 65 \u00b0F (18 \u00b0C), the grubs won\u2019t be feeding and the powder won\u2019t be ingested. The soil doesn't need to be damp or wet for you to apply the Milky Spore."
