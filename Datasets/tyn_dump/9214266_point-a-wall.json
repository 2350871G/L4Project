Lime mortar should be available for purchase at a local hardware store or gardening center. Landscaping-supply businesses will also likely sell lime mortar. It\u2019s difficult to estimate how much lime mortar you\u2019ll need to point your wall. It depends on how badly your wall is in need of repair, and whether you\u2019ll be pointing 1, 10, or 100 cracks. That said, if you\u2019re pointing a relatively small wall that\u2019s 3.3 feet (1 m) high by 6.6 feet (2 m) (2 m) wide, you\u2019ll need about 40 lb (18 kg) of lime mortar. A 60-pound (27-kg) bag of lime mortar will usually cost around $5\u2013$10 at your local hardware or home-supply store. You\u2019ll likely need to buy your own sand too, although this should be inexpensive."

It\u2019s easy to pour more water into dry mortar, but if you add too much water all at once, you\u2019ll have to pour in much more mortar and sand to absorb all the extra water. If you're mixing the mortar in a wheelbarrow, mix the mortar using a front to back motion. To speed up the mixing process, use a mixing paddle attached to a drill to stir the mortar."
