Place a heating pad below 1 side of the enclosure and install a reflector or incandescent bulb above it.

This creates a temperature gradient which means that the temperature changes depending on the location inside the enclosure. The heating pad can be one specifically for reptiles or it can be a regular electric blanket that is set to the lowest temperature. It\u2019s important to create a temperature gradient inside the enclosure. This allows the garter snake to move to a warmer area such as the heating pad if needed. It also lets the snake cool down in the cooler part of the enclosure. This is why the heating pad only warms part of the enclosure. A stick-on thermometer is an ideal way to get a good estimate of the temperature inside the enclosure. Temperatures that are above 91 \u00b0F (33 \u00b0C) can be dangerous for garter snakes. If the snake is moving quickly around the enclosure with its mouth open, this means that it is overheating. Immerse the snake in cool, running water and adjust the enclosure temperature to the appropriate range."
