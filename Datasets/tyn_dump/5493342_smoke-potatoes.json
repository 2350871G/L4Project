After the smoker achieves a high and steady heat, reduce the heat to about 250 degrees Fahrenheit (130 degrees Celsius). Open the air vents when you start preheating the smoker. Allow the smoker to heat up for 20 to 30 minutes, at which point it will be about 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius). Turn the air vents so that they are almost completely closed. This should cause the temperature to drop. Watch the thermometer and wait until it drops between 250 and 275 degrees Fahrenheit (130 and 135 degrees Celsius)."

        "Wait until the wood chips begin to smoke before proceeding.",
        "Place the potatoes directly on the smoker rack.",
        "Once the smoker and potatoes are all ready, carefully arrange the potatoes over the smoker rack.",
        "Keep the potatoes in a single layer and try to keep at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space in between them.",
        "Better air flow will result in better, more even cooking.",
        "Cook for 1 hour.",
        "Close the smoker and smoke the potatoes for roughly 60 minutes.",
        "The vents should be partially closed while you smoke the potatoes.",
        "When ready, the potatoes should have the same tender consistency as a baked or microwaved potato.",
        "They should \"give\" a little when squeezed without completely falling apart.",
        "Serve warm.",
        "Remove the finished potatoes from the smoker and serve within several minutes.",
        "Enjoy the smoked potato in the same way you would enjoy a baked potato.",
        "Slice it open and add butter, sour cream, cheese, chives, bacon, or any other desired toppings.",
        "Method Two: Charcoal Grill Soak the wood chips.",
        "Cover 2 cups (500 ml) of untreated wood chips with water.",
        "Keep the chips submerged for 30 minutes.",
        "Mesquite chips work well with potatoes, but alder wood chips are another good choice.",
        "This step is only necessary if you are using dry wood chips.",
        "Pre-soaked chips do not need to be soaked a second time.",
        "Separate the coals.",
        "Create two even piles of charcoal on either side of the grill.",
        "Separate the two piles by placing a foil drip pan in the center of the grill.",
        "You will likely need to remove the grill grate while filling the grill with coal.",
        "After putting everything in place, return the grate to its proper position.",
        "Light a fire.",
        "Use a lighter to start both piles of charcoal on fire.",
        "Allow the charcoal to burn down until it is covered by white ash.",
        "You may need to sprinkle the coals with lighter fluid before setting them on fire.",
        "It can take 10 to 20 minutes for the coals to burn down significantly enough.",
        "Prepare the potatoes as you wait.",
        "Prick each potato with a fork.",
        "Use a metal fork to pierce the skin of each potato 8 to 12 times.",
        "Space the piercings evenly around the entire potato.",
        "You should do this step while the fire is burning down.",
        "Piercing the skin of each potato allows steam to escape from inside the potatoes during the cooking process.",
        "Season with butter, salt, and pepper.",
        "Brush the skin of each potato with enough melted butter to completely coat the surface.",
        "Generously season with salt and pepper, if desired.",
        "The salt and pepper amounts can be altered to suit your own tastes.",
        "Add wood chips to the coals.",
        "Once the potatoes are ready and the coals have burned enough for ash to form, evenly spread your soaked wood chips over the surface of your charcoal piles.",
        "You'll need to spread about 1 cup (250 ml) of wood chips over each separate pile.",
        "You do not need to spread any wood chips over the drip tray.",
        "Place the potatoes on the grill grate.",
        "Position the potatoes over the center of the grill grate.",
        "Keep each potato over the drip tray and not over either pile of coals.",
        "The potatoes must also be arranged in a single layer with at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space separating them.",
        "Both precautions will allow for more even cooking.",
        "Smoke the potatoes until soft.",
        "Cover the grill and smoke the potatoes without turning for 60 to 75 minutes.",
        "Check the potatoes after the first hour.",
        "If they are not sufficiently tender, add 12 fresh coals and 1/2 cup (125 ml) pre-soaked wood chips per side, then continue cooking.",
        "When ready, the potatoes should be soft enough to squeeze and pierce with a metal skewer.",
        "The consistency should be similar to that of a baked potato.",
        "Serve warm.",
        "Take the cooked potatoes off the grill and serve them within a few minutes.",
        "Smoked potatoes can be served in the same way as baked potatoes.",
        "Split each potato open and cover with the toppings of your choice.",
        "Popular options include butter, sour cream, cheese, bacon, and green onions.",
        "Method Three: Gas Grill Soak the wood chips, if applicable.",
        "If you plan to use wood chips with your gas grill, submerge 2 cups (500 ml) in a bowl of water.",
        "Let the chips soak for 30 minutes.",
        "Only use wood chips if your grill has a separate smoker box or smoker pouch.",
        "Do not worry about wood chips if your grill does not have a smoker attachment.",
        "Only use untreated wood chips.",
        "If using pre-soaked wood chips instead of dry ones, you can skip this step.",
        "Mesquite and alder wood chips are both good choices for smoked potatoes.",
        "Preheat the burners on high.",
        "Turn on all the burners of your grill, setting them to high heat.",
        "Wait until the burners are fully preheated before continuing.",
        "If there is no light or indicator to let you know when the burners have preheated, wait at least 10 minutes before moving onto the next step.",
        "Turn off the center burners.",
        "Switch off the center burners, then place a drip pan in the center of the grill over the burners you just turned off.",
        "If your grill only has two burners, turn one off and place a drip pan over that burner.",
        "Lower the burner temperature.",
        "Reduce the heat of the remaining burners to medium or medium-low.",
        "Wait approximately 10 minutes for the temperature inside the grill to drop.",
        "If the grill has a thermometer inside or on the lid, wait for the internal temperature to read 250 degrees Fahrenheit (130 degrees Celsius) before proceeding.",
        "Place wood chips in a smoker box, if applicable.",
        "If your grill has a smoker attachment, fill it with your soaked wood chips now.",
        "Continue preheating the grill until you see smoke coming from the attachment.",
        "Prepare the potatoes.",
        "Pierce each potato several times with a metal fork, the season with melted butter, salt, and pepper.",
        "Pierce each potato 8 to 12 times, spacing the holes evenly around the surface.",
        "Doing this lets steam and pressure escape from the potato during the cooking process.",
        "Brush enough melted butter over each potato to completely coat the surface.",
        "Use as much salt and pepper as desired to satisfy your own tastes.",
        "Place the potatoes on the grill.",
        "Arrange the prepared potatoes over the drip tray placed in your prepared grill, keeping them in a single layer.",
        "Try to keep 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between them, if not more.",
        "Good air circulation will result in better cooking.",
        "The potatoes must be over the drip tray regardless of whether that tray is in the center of the grill or along one side.",
        "Cover and smoke until tender.",
        "Cover the grill and smoke the potatoes for 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes.",
        "You do not need to turn the potatoes as they cook.",
        "When ready, the potatoes should be roughly the same consistency as a baked potato.",
        "You should be able to squeeze the center with your fingers, but the potato should not completely fall apart when you do so.",
        "You should also be able to easily pierce the potato with a metal skewer.",
        "Serve warm.",
        "Remove the smoked potatoes from your grill.",
        "Let them cool slightly for 2 to 5 minutes, then serve and enjoy.",
        "Serve smoked potatoes like you would serve baked potatoes.",
        "Slice each potato open and add butter, sour cream, cheese, bacon, green onions, or any other toppings you may desire."
