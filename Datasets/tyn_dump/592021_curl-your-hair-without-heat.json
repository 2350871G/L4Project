If you\u2019d prefer tighter curls, use small or medium rollers, which typically range from \u20444\u2013\u20442 in (0.64\u20131.27 cm) in diameter. Rod-shaped curlers are great for creating spiral curls or defining natural curls. They're also perfect for curling short hair, since they tend to have a smaller diameter. If you don\u2019t have rollers, you can cut strips out of an old T-shirt, instead. Make the strips the same width that you want your curls to be, and a little longer than the length of your hair. Foam rollers might get damaged if you put them into wet hair, so make sure to use a roller that\u2019s designed to be used while your hair is damp. Also, look for a soft roller, like one made from rubber, satin, or silicone, if you\u2019re planning to sleep with the rollers in."

For your pin curls to look their best, you\u2019ll want each section of hair to be approximately the same size. Typically, pin curls are made with about 1 in (2.5 cm) sections, which will allow you to wrap them easily. If you experiment with pin curls, you may find that slightly larger or smaller curls work better for your hair! If you prefer, you can pin up the hair on the top of your hair and start the curls at the bottom, then work your way around to the front of your head. Wrap the ends of the first section around one of your fingers 1-2 times. Place the ends of your hair against your finger, then loosely roll the hair around it a few times.

Your hair might hold a curl better 2-3 days after your last shampoo, rather than the same day you washed it. Comb your hair thoroughly. To get smooth, sleek curls, detangle your hair completely before you put it up. Use a wide-toothed comb to get rid of any tangles, and part your hair with the comb if you\u2019re planning on doing more than one bun. If you\u2019re only making one bun, comb your hair back away from your face. Create one bun for voluminous waves. Pull your hair back into a ponytail at the top of your head, then fasten it with a hair tie. Wrap your hair in a bun by twisting the ponytail 2-3 times, then wrapping your ponytail around the first elastic all the way to the end. Secure the bun with a second hair elastic or bobby pins. You can also make a donut bun with a sock. Cut the toes off of a sock and roll it into a donut shape, then place the end of your ponytail through the hole in the sock. Spread the ends of your hair until they cover the entire sock, tucking the ends underneath. Then, roll the sock down the length of your ponytail until you reach the crown of your head, and secure it in place with bobby pins. Separate your hair into 2 buns for tighter waves. If you want waves with a little more curl, try dividing your hair into 2 buns or twists, instead. Once you\u2019ve parted your hair with your comb, pull each section into a ponytail high on the side of your head. Twist the ponytail tightly until it starts to curl around itself, then continue wrapping the ponytail around the base all the way to the ends. Secure each twist with a hair tie or bobby pins. You can also tuck the twist into a wraparound cloth headband to secure it. For curls that start lower on your head, place the buns near the nape of your neck.

Madeleine Johnson\t\t\tHair Stylist & Hair Extensions Specialist\t\t\t\tSleep in braids overnight for beachy waves. Instead of a bun, you can put your hair in tight braids while it's wet and leave the braids in overnight. Braids are a great alternative to heat styling. Sleep in the buns. Since you\u2019re wrapping your damp hair up tightly, you\u2019ll need to let your hair dry for about 6-8 hours, or overnight. Luckily, this is a great way to get wavy hair while you sleep, and since your hair is pulled up, it\u2019s more comfortable to lay on than some other styles might be. If you don\u2019t want to sleep in the buns, try wearing your hair up all day, then take it down for a glam evening look. Take the buns out in the morning. When you wake up, gently remove the hair elastics or pins that are holding your buns in place. Use your fingers to loosen your hair, and enjoy your light waves! Use a little hairspray to set the waves, if you want. Using Cold Rollers Choose wet-set rollers that are a little smaller than the curls you want. If you want larger curls, or if you mostly just want to add volume, opt for large rollers, like a 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm) diameter. If you\u2019d prefer tighter curls, use small or medium rollers, which typically range from \u20444\u2013\u20442 in (0.64\u20131.27 cm) in diameter. Rod-shaped curlers are great for creating spiral curls or defining natural curls. They're also perfect for curling short hair, since they tend to have a smaller diameter. If you don\u2019t have rollers, you can cut strips out of an old T-shirt, instead. Make the strips the same width that you want your curls to be, and a little longer than the length of your hair. Foam rollers might get damaged if you put them into wet hair, so make sure to use a roller that\u2019s designed to be used while your hair is damp. Also, look for a soft roller, like one made from rubber, satin, or silicone, if you\u2019re planning to sleep with the rollers in. Dampen your hair. Wash and condition your hair, or just spritz it with water from a spray bottle. If you\u2019re starting with wet hair, gently blot your hair with a soft towel until it\u2019s damp. The curls will hold better if you start with damp hair, but if it\u2019s too wet, it might not dry completely once you put in the rollers. Do not apply serum or leave-in conditioner to your hair, as the curls may not set. Detangle your hair with a wide-toothed comb. Gently run a wide-toothed comb through your damp hair to make sure it\u2019s perfectly tangle-free. If you have any tangles in your hair, your curls will look messy, and it will be harder to get the sections perfectly even. Avoid brushing your hair when it\u2019s wet, which can lead to breakage. Section off a small piece of your hair near your forehead. Separate out a piece of hair that\u2019s about the same width as the roller, or just a little smaller. Typically, this will be about 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm). Hold the section of hair away from your head vertically, then place the roller horizontally against the end of your hair, on the side facing away from you. Roll the hair away from your face, all the way down toward your scalp. Secure the roller with the included clips. If you\u2019re using a T-shirt, roll your hair the same way, then tie the ends of the strip to hold the curl in place. If you only want to curl the ends of your hair, stop rolling halfway up your head and tie the strips at the place where you want the curls to stop. Continue rolling the top section of your hair. By following a pattern when you\u2019re rolling your hair, you\u2019ll end up with a more symmetrical style, and it will be easier to keep the sections separate. Start by rolling the top section of your hair, or the mohawk area, all the way back to your crown. When you\u2019re finished, you should have a neat row of horizontal rollers all the way along the top of your head. This will give you plenty of volume at your roots. Roll the sides and back of your hair to finish. Once you\u2019ve rolled the front section, take another section of hair near one of your ears. This time, hold the hair straight out from your head horizontally, and place the roller vertically at the end of your hair. Roll the hair all the way to your scalp and secure it again, then continue for the hair on both sides of your head. Roll your hair under for curls that curve toward your neck, or roll it up for curls that bounce outward. You can arrange the rollers at the back of your head horizontally or vertically, depending on the look you\u2019re going for. Using horizontal rollers will give you more of a voluminous curl, while putting in your rollers vertically will result in more of a spiral curl. Leave the rollers in place until your hair is dry. Since you\u2019re not using heat, it will take several hours for the curls to set, so plan to leave the rollers in for at least 4 hours, although overnight is better. If you want your hair to dry faster without adding any heat, use a hair dryer set to its coolest temperature. Hide the rollers by wrapping your head in a silk scarf if you need to go somewhere before your curls are set. Remove the rollers and loosen your hair. Once your hair is completely dry, take the clips out of the rollers, untie the T-shirt strips, or remove the bobby pins from your hair. Do this gently, especially if you want tighter curls. For loose curls or big waves, gently run a wide-toothed comb through your hair. You can also run your fingers through your curls to fan them out, but do not brush them. Set the look with a little hairspray if you'd like. Wrapping Your Hair around a Headband Start with damp hair. Your curls will set best if your hair is slightly damp when you put it up. Wash and dry your hair as normal, then blot it dry. If you don\u2019t need to wash your hair, you can just spritz it with plain water from a spray bottle, instead. Use a wide-toothed comb to detangle your hair, as well. Place an elastic headband over your head. Pull the headband down so it sits low on your forehead and circles around the back of your head, over your hair. Your curls will start where the headband sits, so adjust it based on how you want your curls to look. This is a great option if you want to go out while your curls are setting! Your hair will be pulled up in a soft, romantic style. Try picking a headband that will match your outfit for the day! Did You Know? It can be hard to get curls when you have short hair, but you can try this as long as your hair is long enough to wrap around the headband! Take a small section of hair and wrap it around the headband. Start on one side, working with the hair closest to your face. Choose a section that\u2019s the same width you want your curls to be\u2014about \u20442\u2013\u20444 in (1.3\u20131.9 cm) will result in soft, pretty waves. Wrap the first section up and over the headband, then tuck it behind the elastic. At this point, your hair will be looped once around the headband. Keep looping the hair around the headband until you get to the end of the section, then pin it in place with a bobby pin. If you don\u2019t have bobby pins, you can just tuck the ends of your hair under the headband to hold them in place. Continue wrapping all the way around your head. Once you\u2019ve wrapped the first section around the headband, take another section of hair that\u2019s about the same size as the first one, and wrap it in the same way. Keep doing this until you\u2019ve wrapped all of your hair around the headband. To make sure your curls are even, you may want to wrap all the way around one side, then move to the front of the other side and work toward the back again. Let your hair dry in the headband. You\u2019ll need about 4-6 hours for your hair to dry, or a little more if you have very thick hair. You can wear this style out, or you can sleep in it if you\u2019d prefer. Either way, check to make sure your hair is completely dry before you take it down, or your curls might fall out. To speed things up, you can use a hair dryer on the cold setting to blow air over your hair. Remove the headband and shake out your curls. Take out all of the pins around the whole headband, then gently unwrap each section of your hair. When you\u2019ve unwrapped all of your curls, slip the headband off of your head. This style will give you pretty, vintage curls. Lightly scrunch your curls with mousse or hairspray to hold them in place.",
