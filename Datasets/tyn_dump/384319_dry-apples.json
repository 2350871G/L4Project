Here are some methods you can use to pretreat the apples:\nSoak the apple slices in lemon juice. Mix 1 cup (240 mL) lemon juice into 1 quart (2 pints) of water. Do not soak for more than 10 minutes. Drain the liquid from the fruit. Soak the apple slices in sodium bisulfite. Mix 2 teaspoons (9.85 mL) of sodium bisulfite into 1 quart (2 pints) of water. Do not soak for more than 10 minutes. Drain the liquid from the fruit. Soak the apple slices in ascorbic acid for a result 6 times more effective than lemon juice. Mix 1 tablespoon (14.78 mL) of crystalline ascorbic acid into 1 quart (2 pints) of cold water. Soak the fruit for 3 minutes. Drain the liquid from the fruit. You can also add orange juice and lemon juice mixed with water."
