Now, while holding it snug, mark off a small vertical line where the 2 ends of the fabric overlap. Purchase red cotton fabric from crafts stores\u2014just make sure the color matches your skin suit! You can also use a red pillowcase or t-shirt. Cotton is the comfortable fabric choice, but don't be afraid to use a different kind. Just make sure you can tolerate it as mask material. Mark off a straight cutline down the fabric. Using the overlap mark as a guide, draw a vertical line across the fabric where the 2 ends overlap. This is where you need to cut to remove the excess fabric. Use a straight wooden ruler to guide your vertical line. Cut off the excess portion of fabric. Use a pair of scissors to cut along the vertical line and remove the excess fabric. Use a ruler to guide your cutting if it makes things easier! Never use scissors without the help of an adult. Create 2 hems at each end of the fabric. Use a glue gun to apply a small line of glue down one of the vertical portions of the fabric about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) from the edge. Now, fold the \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) of fabric over the glue and press it down firmly for about a minute until it dries in place. Repeat the above process for the other vertical edge of the fabric. Purchase a glue gun from a crafts or big-box store. Glue both of the hems together. Lay the fabric onto a flat surface with both hems facing upward.

Now, press the side pieces down onto the glue and hold them in place for about 1 minute until the glue dries. After this step, the excess fabric should be barely noticeable when looking at your mask from the front. Making Deadpool's Eyes Cut out 2 eye pieces from a plastic mask. Don't worry about the color\u2014it's going to be covered with leather. Start by drawing from the bridge of the nose down to the just below the cheekbone. Now, draw from the temple down to the same point below the cheekbone. Bring your marker back up to the bridge of the nose and draw to the top of the forehead.

Repeat this process for both eyepieces. Use a marker to create the eyepiece outline. For black face masks, use a white marker. If your face mask is white, use a black marker. Cut 2 triangles from a piece of cardboard. Each Deadpool eyepiece has a pointed top part that can be created using cardboard triangles. Start by drawing the triangles onto a piece of cardboard.

Apply small lines of glue onto the eyepieces underneath the remaining loose pieces of leather. Afterward, press the fabric down and hold it for 2 to 3 minutes until dry.
