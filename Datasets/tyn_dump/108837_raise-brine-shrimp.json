        "Once the tank has maintained this temperature for 24 hours, it is stable enough to hold the brine shrimp.",
        "Check the temperature at least twice a day\u2014if the heater is accidentally unplugged or the temperature drastically changes for any reason, your brine shrimp could die.",
        "Hatching Brine Shrimp Buy brine shrimp eggs.",
        "Packets of dehydrated brine shrimp cysts are sold at aquarium and pet stores.",
        "Beginning with one packet is fine, since the brine shrimp will multiply rapidly.",
        "Place the cysts in the water, and they will hatch after 15 to 20 hours.",
        "If your tank is the correct temperature and salinity for the shrimp, they will hatch within a day.",
        "12 hours after that, you will have young shrimp swimming around in the tank.",
        "Enjoy watching the brine shrimp population grow.",
        "Brine shrimp will multiply quickly.",
        "They will begin as tiny cysts and end up as small shrimp.",
        "You do not need to aid them in hatching or growing, since they will do so naturally in a well-maintained tank.",
        "If your brine shrimp are not growing or hatching, check the salinity and temperature of the tank for problems.",
        "It is natural for some of the brine shrimp to die.",
        "Maintaining a Suitable Habitat Make a reserve of saltwater.",
        "You will need to keep the saltwater on hand for when you change the tank water.",
        "Always having a gallon of saltwater ready will make changing the water much easier.",
        "Fill a gallon container with reverse osmosis water.",
        "Add the salt per manufacturer\u2019s instructions.",
        "Cap the container, and store the saltwater in a cool, dry area until you need it.",
        "Use a gravel vacuum to change the water in the hatchery regularly, about 20% (2 gallons) per week.",
        "Turn off the aeration and circulation system before changing the water.",
        "Let the air in the tank settle so it is not moving.",
        "Shine a bright light at the surface of the tank so the brine shrimp all flock to it.",
        "Siphon the dirty water off the bottom of the tank with the gravel vaccum.",
        "Then, replace the siphoned water with some of the marine salt mixture you made earlier.",
        "Check the salinity and temperature of the tank to make sure the levels are good.",
        "Rinse or replace the sponge filter every 1-4 weeks.",
        "The sponge filter may get noticeably dirty.",
        "To rinse or replace the filter, turn off the air pump, remove the sponge, and rinse it in the used tank water, or non-chlorinated (conditioned with Prime or other conditioner) room temperature-or current temperature of your aquarium  water.",
        "When it is clean again, replace it, and turn the air pump back on.",
        "You will only need to get a brand new sponge if it disintegrates.",
        "It houses useful bacteria to keep the tank healthy.",
        "Never rinse the sponge or any other filter in anything other than used tank water or conditioned water.",
        "To rinse filter media in too hot, too cold or chlorinated water destroys the bacteria that supports a healthy tank.",
        "Use a flashlight to herd the brine shrimp away from the sponge filter when doing this.",
        "You may need someone to help you grab the filter or shine the light.",
        "Regularly check the tank\u2019s temperature, salinity, and cleanliness.",
        "All of these factors are important to keep in mind when you are maintaining a saltwater habitat.",
        "Get into the habit of checking these factors weekly.",
        "Feeding Brine Shrimp Use enrichment formulas.",
        "Selcon is a popular brand, and there are many others available at most aquarium stores.",
        "Ask an employee for help if you have trouble finding the formulas, or use an online store to buy the food in bulk.",
        "Feed the brine shrimp yeast, pureed greens, powdered eggs, or powdered milk.",
        "Brine shrimp are not picky, and they will eat these human foods.",
        "Spirulina is another option to feed the brine shrimp.",
        "Feed only small amounts, but do so several times a day.",
        "Do not overfeed the brine shrimp!",
        "If the tank water begins to look excessively murky and dirty with food, clean the tank and feed the brine shrimp smaller amounts.",
        "Harvesting Brine Shrimp Begin harvesting the brine shrimp after 8 days.",
        "Of course, if you are raising brine shrimp purely for pleasure, you do not have to harvest them, but after 8 days, the adults are large enough to catch with a net and feed to other fish.",
        "Turn off the circulation system.",
        "After about 10 minutes, the empty cysts shells will float to the surface, and unhatched cysts will sink to the bottom.",
        "Now, you can more easily catch the live brine shrimp.",
        "Shine a flashlight where you want them to herd.",
        "All of the brine shrimp will flock to the light, so they will be easy to catch with the fish net.",
        "Use a fish net to catch the adult brine shrimp.",
        "The smaller brine shrimp will fall through the net, but larger ones won\u2019t.",
        "Catch the amount you wish to feed to your other fish.",
