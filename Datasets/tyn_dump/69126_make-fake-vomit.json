        "Don't get too carried away!",
        "Let the vomit cool for a few hours.",
        "After that, you can take the vomit off the plate with a spatula and put it somewhere to gross someone out.",
        "Making Reusable Vomit with Glue Squeeze out some glue into a mixing cup.",
        "You can use a decoupage glue, like Mod Podge, or white school glue.",
        "Plan on squeezing out about 1/4 to 1/2 cup (60 to 120 milliliters).",
        "Use a cup that you can throw away, like a paper one.",
        "Add a hint of brown.",
        "You just need a tiny drop of brown food coloring, water color, or paint.",
        "The vomit will look light tan now, but it will get darker after it dries.",
        "Stir it up until the color is even.",
        "You can use just about anything to stir: a plastic spoon, a popsicle stick, a toothpick, etc.",
        "Pour half of it out onto a sheet of parchment paper.",
        "Place the parchment paper onto a baking sheet first.",
        "Next, pour the glue onto the parchment paper into a vomit shape.",
        "Save the rest of the glue for later.",
        "You can also use a sheet of wax paper or even plastic wrap.",
        "Add something chunky.",
        "A handful of dry cat or dog food will look gross.",
        "If this is human vomit, you could try a handful of dry oatmeal or granola.",
        "Put most of the chunks in the middle of the glue puddle, and a few bits on the edges.",
        "Cover the chunky bits with the rest of the glue.",
        "Simply pour the rest of your colored glue over the vomit puddle.",
        "Make sure that you cover all the chunky bits you added in.",
        "This will help seal them in.",
        "Wait for the glue to dry.",
        "The glue will turn clearish once it dries.",
        "This may take a few days.",
        "If you get impatient, let it dry for about 48 hours, then bake it for about 10 minutes in the oven at 275\u00b0F (135\u00b0C).",
        "If you want to bake it, open up a window.",
        "It will stink!",
        "Don't put wax paper or plastic wrap into the oven.",
        "If you used those, you'll have to let it air dry.",
        "Peel the vomit off.",
        "The glue will dry semi-flexible, but be careful not to bend it too much.",
        "Leave the vomit some place for your victim to find, like the floor or their pillow.",
        "Because this vomit is made from glue, it should last a very long time."
