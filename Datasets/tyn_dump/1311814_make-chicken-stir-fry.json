Others take more of an \"everything-but-the-kitchen-sink\" approach. Go with whatever sounds good to you, or whatever you happen to have in your kitchen. When preparing the veg, try to chop everything into pieces of approximately the same size. This prevents one vegetable from becoming overcooked while another is still raw. Regardless of uniform size, some vegetables will still cook quicker than others. Place all of the chopped veg into bowls, separated according to their cooking times. This will make it easy for you to throw all of the  vegetables with longer cooking times into the wok together, while keeping the fast cooking veg separate. If you are unsure of how long each vegetable takes to cook, here's a quick guide:\nMushrooms will need five to ten minutes, depending on their size and type. Cabbage, spinach and other greens will take approximately four to six minutes. Veggies like asparagus, broccoli, carrots and green beans will take between three and five minutes. Peppers, peas, courgette and squash will only need two to three minutes. Bean sprouts are the fastest of all, with a cooking time of less than a minute."
