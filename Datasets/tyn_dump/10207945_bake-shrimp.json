You can also thaw frozen shrimp by placing them in a colander and rinse them with cold water for about 5 minutes. Frozen shrimp often comes peeled and deveined. For this variety, skip to the cooking process after thawing. Fresh shrimp may have the head, legs, and tail still on, so you will need to do a little extra work."

Depending on your oven and heat setting, the cooking time may vary. It usually takes between 7 to 10 minutes, though. Serve the shrimp with bread and store leftovers. Since the butter sauce can be heavy, lemon butter shrimp is often eaten as is. Treat it like a baked shrimp scampi. It goes well with a slice of crusty bread. You can use the bread to mop up excess sauce. You can always add the shrimp to angel hair pasta and other noodles if you prefer. Keep the leftovers in an airtight container. They will last about 4 days in the refrigerator and 3 months in the freezer.",

        "The shell should crack down the middle, allowing you to gently peel it off like you would with an egg.",
        "You can also use a pair of kitchen shears to cut into the shell on the shrimp\u2019s top side.",
        "The shell is a little harder there, but after you cut it you can easily peel it off.",
