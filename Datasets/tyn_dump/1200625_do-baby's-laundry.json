            "description": "Hand-me-downs can sometimes be stained or moldy from sitting for a long time. Since you don't want your new baby wearing moldy clothes, you could try washing these clothes separately with hot water, detergent, and, optionally, vinegar. Make sure all mold is gone and that there is no lingering smell of mildew. It may take a few washes and don't get upset if you can't save them all. Hot water or (for white or pale clothes) chlorine bleach will kill all the mildew, though harmless stains might remain. Wash a final time with the rest of your baby's clothes."

            "description": "It's best to use fragrance-free, dye-free detergent, sometimes called a \"sensitive skin\" detergent and skip bleaches, softeners, and stain removers. Tide Free and Clear, and Method are all great detergent choices. Watch out for detergents with strong perfumes or bleach because they may irritate baby's delicate senses and skin. \"Fragrance-free\" generally means without any fragrance, while \"unscented\" can mean either without fragrance or with only mild fragrance to mask the sometimes-odd smell of active ingredients. Either may well be fine, but all else being equal, go with \"fragrance-free\"."

Baby clothes can also be dried on a clothes line. Sunshine on diapers is an excellent method to ensure they are thoroughly clean."

If baby's clothes are kept separate and organized, it's easier to keep track of them and know when you'll need to wash more."
