    "text": " Dressing Like Harry Potter Put on black trousers and a white shirt. If you can, use slacks and a collared, button-up shirt. The Hogwarts dress code requires everyone to look smashing. Wear a burgundy cardigan (red sweater) in cold weather. Wear an old black robe. Harry Potter doesn't wear this all the time in the films, but it's required for all Hogwarts students in the books. Besides, a shirt and trousers aren't too wizardly by themselves. There are several ways to track one of these down: Look in graduation stores that sell academic gowns. Ask whether they have old ones they will sell cheaply for costume purposes. Thrift stores, charity stores, and costume shops might stock these. If you know any professors, judges, or lawyers, ask to borrow their robes. (Note \u2013 lawyers in the United States don't wear robes.) Wear a long, black coat back-to-front, or a long black skirt over your shoulders. Hide long hair under a hat. A pointy black hat isn't necessary for Harry Potter, but it is easily recognized as a wizarding hat. The main use for a hat like this is to hide long hair, if you have it.

Adding Props Turn a stick into a wand. Find a strong stick from any tree, about 11 inches (28 cm) long. Decorate it however you like with paint, or make spiral patterns with puffy paint or a hot glue gun. Harry Potter's wand looks pretty simple in the films, but your version doesn't have to be. You can use a thick wooden dowel from a hardware shop instead. For a quick and easy wand, tape together a few pencils, twigs, or chopsticks. Tape brown or black construction paper over them.
