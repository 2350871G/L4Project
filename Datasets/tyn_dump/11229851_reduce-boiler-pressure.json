It is usually in highly-visible area, but may be near the ground on the side of your boiler near the return line or release valve. Look for a gauge with a needle and numbers on it to find your pressure gauge.Tip: The pressure gauge is normally right next to a temperature gauge. If the pressure is high and your temperature gauge is in the red, call an emergency boiler repair company. High pressure and extreme temperatures can lead to explosions or damage to your property. Your gauge will read pressure in either bars or psi. Psi stands for pressure per square inch, while the bar is a metric unit of pressure (1 bar is roughly 15 psi)."

The pressure may be lower if it is warm out, or higher if it is cold out. If it nears 3 bar or 45 psi though, your pressure is too high. Pressure gauges are often color-coded. If the needle is in the green, your pressure is usually fine. Yellow typically means that the pressure is high, but acceptable. Red means that the pressure is too high or low."

        "Put a bucket under the radiator bleed valve and get a cloth.",
        "The bleed valve is the small port on the side of a radiator near the top.",
        "Place a bowl or bucket under the valve and get a large, dry cloth.",
        "Put on thick gloves before touching your radiator.Warning: The radiator will be hot if it was running recently, so you have to wear thick gloves to protect yourself.",
        "Even if the radiator isn\u2019t hot, bleeding it causes hot water to come out.",
        "It\u2019s pretty easy to see a bleed valve.",
        "It will be the only object attached near the top of your radiator.",
        "If you\u2019re bleeding the boiler itself, hook up a hose to the threading on the bleed sprout.",
        "This will look like a standard outdoor hose spout, and will be pointing downward near the bottom of your boiler.",
        "Some bleed sprouts point directly to a nearby drain.",
        "Open a bleed valve near the top of your radiator with the key.",
        "Use the radiator key or tool to start loosening the bleed valve.",
        "Turn it counterclockwise once or twice until you start hearing hissing.",
        "This is the air leaving your pipes and a sign that your pipes are clearing!",
        "A little bit of water may come out while the air is emptying so keep the cloth nearby while it makes noise to catch or wipe up any water.",
        "It should only be a little bit of water, but that may change after a few seconds.",
        "Keep your key attached to the valve so that you can close it quickly.",
        "To open a boiler\u2019s bleed sprout, simply turn the handle 2-3 times counterclockwise.",
        "Close the valve when water starts flowing out.",
        "As soon as the hissing noise turns into the bubbling sound of water flowing, it is a sign that you are almost done.",
        "Once your radiator starts to release a steady stream of water, close your valve.",
        "Tighten it by turning it clockwise until you can\u2019t turn it any further and the hissing noise has disappeared.",
        "On a boiler, run the water until it runs clear and doesn\u2019t sputter.",
        "Repeat this process on every single radiator in the building.",
        "Bleed your other radiators, even if they aren\u2019t cold or lukewarm.",
        "Use your radiator key, bucket, and cloth to bleed every radiator in the building.",
        "Each time you bleed a radiator, you\u2019re removing the air pockets in the pipes leading up to that unit.",
        "By bleeding every single radiator, you ensure that all air is removed from the boiler system.",
        "Solving Uncommon Problems Close the valves on the filling loop if they're open.",
        "The filling loop is a thin, U-shaped pipe that connects 2 pipes under or next to your pressure gauge.",
        "The filling loop is used to refill your boiler from the water main.",
        "If it is left open, it may be feeding a constant supply of water to your boiler, causing the pressure to increase.",
        "Make sure that the filling loop\u2019s valves are closed by rotating the tab on top of each connection so that it runs perpendicular to the pipe and stays closed.",
        "If you ever bleed all of the water out of a boiler, you use the filling loop to refill it.",
        "Put your ear next to the filling loop.",
        "If you hear water coming through it, it is a sign that it is open.",
        "The filling loops may be soft and pliable like the supply lines under a sink.",
        "Remove debris by draining a little bit of water out of the filter.",
        "Newer boilers come with filters that prevent debris in the pipes from returning to the boiler.",
        "Your filter may be filled with bigger pieces of debris that are blocking the flow of water and increasing pressure.",
        "Get a large bucket and set it out underneath the spout.",
        "Turn the spout to release water and wait for the pressure on your gauge to drop.",
        "Once it does, retighten the spout until it is closed.Warning: This can be dangerous if you\u2019ve never done it before.",
        "The water may be quite hot and it come out very quickly.",
        "Consult a professional if you\u2019re not familiar with your boiler\u2019s filtration system.",
        "If the pressure doesn\u2019t drop as you\u2019re emptying the filter, you could have a faulty pressure gauge.",
        "The filter is a larger container attached to a pipe next to the boiler.",
        "It is usually plastic and built into a pipe near the pressure filler loop.",
        "Older furnaces don\u2019t tend to have filters.",
        "Monitor the pressure control boxes to see if they\u2019re operating normally.",
        "The pressure control boxes are self-contained mechanisms that regulate the pressure on larger boilers automatically.",
        "They are usually on the side of a furnace or on a nearby wall and they look like clear thermostats.",
        "While your boiler is running, watch your pressure control boxes to make sure that they click on and off as your boiler turns on and off.",
        "If more than 1 of them is clicking at a time, contact a boiler repair specialist to diagnose problems with them.",
        "Each box performs a different function.",
        "The first 2 boxes control when the boiler automatically cuts on and off.",
        "The other 2 automatically regulate pressure increases and decreases.",
        "If all 4 of them are clicking at the same time, something is wrong with your system.",
        "Many pressure control boxes have small vials of mercury in them.",
        "If you see 2-4 boxes with little tubes filled with a silver liquid, these are your pressure control boxes.",
        "You can\u2019t really do anything about your pressure control boxes without the help of a professional.",
        "Some of them are filled with mercury, but even if they aren\u2019t, they\u2019re incredibly complicated parts and require an experienced hand to adjust them.",
        "Look at the top and sides of each box.",
        "If there is a small button labeled \u201creset\u201d you can press it to automatically reset the boxes."
