Then, shake in approximately one tablespoon (15ml) of baking soda for every cup the flask holds. The vinegar and baking soda mixture will froth up, so be sure to put the flask in the sink when you combine them. Baking soda and vinegar are excellent at killing germs and wearing down stains when acting together. It\u2019s important to use distilled white vinegar, as it's more acidic and will result in a better cleaning. It\u2019s also less likely to leave a lingering odor or taste in your flask, which other types of vinegar may do."

This will help loosen the dried stains from the inner surface of the flask, as well as distribute the vinegar and baking soda throughout. Leave the cap off the flask to keep the pressure from building up too much. Baking soda and vinegar are notoriously reactive.

A basic bottle brush only costs about $5, but it\u2019s a very useful tool to have on hand for difficult cleaning jobs.
