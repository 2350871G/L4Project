You can give your box to a person and tell them never to open it like Pandora, or you can put it out in a library or classroom, telling people who pass never to open it. Either way, you should tell people the story of Pandora and how she opened the box even though she was forbidden to, and you should put a sign on the box with something like \"Pandora's Box\" or \"Never Open\"."
