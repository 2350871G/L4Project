        "Go around the edges of the painting and clean up any drippings with the paintbrush.",
        "Let the isolation coat dry for 24 hours.",
        "The painting will be dry to the touch after about 30 minutes, but it\u2019s recommended that you wait an entire day before applying the varnish.",
        "Leave it laying flat somewhere it won\u2019t be in the way of pets, children, or other disturbances.It won\u2019t hurt the painting if you leave it for longer than 24 hours before moving on to varnishing.",
        "Adding Layers of Varnish Position the painting on a flat surface.",
        "You shouldn\u2019t varnish a painting while it\u2019s propped up on an easel or hanging on a wall, as the varnish will run off the canvas.",
        "Lay old newspaper underneath the canvas to catch any drips.If the painting is too big or if you don\u2019t have a table available, you could always set it on the floor.",
        "Just make sure it\u2019s somewhere out of the way so it won\u2019t get stepped on.Using Spray Varnish: Set the painting vertically for spray varnish.",
        "Shake the can well, and then spray the painting evenly from left to right and then right to left, all the way down to the bottom of the canvas.",
        "Wait 5-7 minutes between the first coat and second coat and always work in a well-ventilated area.",
        "Prepare the varnish by following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.",
        "Depending on what kind of varnish you decided to use, you may need to dilute it with water or a solvent.",
        "Pour the varnish into a shallow container so it\u2019s easy to dip your paintbrush into it.Some varnishes don\u2019t need to be mixed with anything else, so check the back of the bottle or container before doing anything.",
        "Test the varnish on the painting to see how it alters the colors.",
        "In most cases, the varnish will either amplify the colors you used by adding a layer of gloss, or they may mute them slightly if you\u2019re using a matte finish.",
        "Apply the varnish to a small, inconspicuous part of the painting and let it dry for about 10 minutes to make sure it doesn\u2019t alter your painting in an undesirable way.If the sides of your canvas are painted, you could always test the varnish there so you don\u2019t add any varnish to the actual painting yet.",
        "Use a wide paintbrush to apply the first thin coat of varnish.",
        "Dip about 1/3 of the brush into the varnish, then start brushing it onto the canvas from the center of the painting.",
        "Spread it evenly from side to side using long, even strokes.",
        "Try to follow the same brushstrokes you used when applying the isolation coat.Continue dipping your paintbrush into the varnish as the bristles become dry.",
        "Even out the brushstrokes before the first layer of varnish dries.",
        "After coating the surface area with varnish, go back and brush long, even strokes either from side to side or from top to bottom.",
        "Make sure the layer of varnish is as even as possible.If you notice small bubbles forming in the varnish, use just the tip of your paintbrush to make long strokes from side to side to pop them before the varnish dries.",
        "Sometimes tilting the painting from side to side can help you see if there are areas that you missed or that are over-saturated with the varnish.",
        "Wait 3-6 hours to let the varnish cure before doing your second coat.",
        "Varnish dries pretty quickly but will give better results if it has several hours to dry between each application.",
        "Apply the second coat the same way you did the first coat.Check the instructions on your varnish to see if there are specific curing guidelines.",
        "Most acrylic paintings need just 2 coats of varnish, but if the varnish looks uneven in some sections after it has dried, apply a third coat.",
        "Sometimes if each coat is very thin, it may not evenly cover the entire canvas.",
        "Let the painting cure for 1-2 weeks before moving it or hanging it up.",
        "The varnish may feel dry to the touch soon after it was applied, but it takes time for it to completely dry and adhere to the paint.",
        "Keep the painting somewhere safe from disturbances during the curing process.Place the painting against the wall or on an easel with the painting facing the wall or easel to protect it from getting dust or hairs on it."
