In this way, decisions can be made quickly, there\u2019s a central point of contact for most everything and it reduces confusion and malaise."

There\u2019s nothing like being able to stroll into the living room to watch a late night movie with whoever is staying up. Conversations need not be interrupted prematurely and plus there\u2019s always a central base that is the hub of activity. Sharing the cost of this type of accommodation is practical and cost effective too. Cruise \u2013 the ultimate in convenience. You don\u2019t have to worry about food and you unpack only once. Make sure you get cabins reasonably near each other or else you risk spreading the hub of activity. Tours \u2013 Some tour companies can customize a tour for your family if you have a minimum number of people in your group. Many view tours as a great way to learn more about a place while others may view tours as being too restrictive. Hotels / Resorts \u2013 suites are a great way to pack more people together and to save on costs. For large get-togethers though it can be somewhat impersonal because hotel rooms are too small to accommodate everybody for a chat or to play a game and so you end up with dispersed mini-groups within the get together. If you have to book multiple hotel rooms, try to get them all in one wing or even suites that connect if possible. Look for group discounts too - depending upon the size of your group you may qualify. Family member's house \u2013 choosing one family member\u2019s house to congregate at is definitely the cheapest option. You never have to worry about picking the right restaurant and stocking up is easy to do. There are other options such as working ranches/farms, Disneyland, Disney World, RV, houseboat, camping, renting, and taking that trip around America on Amtrak.The key is to get the commitment first. As soon as you agree, start booking. Once people are committed, meaningful planning goes a lot faster and easier."
