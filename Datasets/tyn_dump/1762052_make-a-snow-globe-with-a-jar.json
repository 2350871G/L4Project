Ensure there's a good flat surface to glue down. Ceramic or plastic are good bets. If you're not sure, place your figurine in a bowl of water for a few hours and see if anything happens. You can also make your own figure out of sculpey clay. It's easy to find in craft stores and comes in a variety of colors."
