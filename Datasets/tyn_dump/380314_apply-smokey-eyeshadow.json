                    "description": "To create a smokey eye, you will need to work with a dark palette. A traditional smokey eye uses blacks and grays, but you can use dark hues of almost any color. Browns, golds, purples, greens, and navy blues all also work well for smokey eyes. You will need a dark eyeliner, a medium-dark eyeshadow, and highlight shadow in the same color group to make your smokey eye. Look for colors and shades that match your skin tone. If you have very fair skin, a mid-tone shadow may be dark enough for a smokey eye with your complexion. If you have ebony skin, you\u2019ll need to use a very deep shade to create a smokey eye. Think about how you want to wear your smokey eye. A lighter, more subtle look could be dressed up or down during the daytime, while a very dark, dramatic smokey eye can be a bold statement when you plan to go out for the night."

                    "description": "A basic smokey eye usually starts with eyeliner. Use a creamy pencil liner, and run it along your upper and lower lash lines. You should keep the liner thinner on the lower lash line, but you can go a little thicker across the upper lash line. Next, smudge the liner with a small brush, your finger, or a cotton bud to soften it. Using your finger to smudge the liner will give your smokey eye a messier, grungier look if you prefer that type of makeup."

Use a small, flat brush to apply your chosen shade across your entire lid, even over the smudged liner. Concentrate more of the pigment on the outer corner of your eye, leaving the inner half of the lid lighter. If you\u2019re worried about the dark shadow looking too harsh, use one that has a slightly shimmery finish. It will reflect light, and your eyes won\u2019t appear quite as dark. If you don\u2019t have a brush to apply the shadow, you can use the sponge-tip applicator that usually comes with eyeshadow to press the color onto your lid."

You don\u2019t want any harsh lines or edges. If you can\u2019t diffuse enough color into the crease from your lid by blending with a bare brush, you can tap the crease brush against the shadow to pick up some additional product.

Depending on your skin tone, apply an ivory, cream, or beige shade with a small brush to those areas. While you can use any light shade that you like to highlight, it\u2019s best to choose a shadow that doesn\u2019t have too much shimmer or glitter unless you use a metallic shadow for the lid.

Start by using an eyelash curler to curl and lift your lashes. Next, apply your favorite mascara to lengthen and thicken the look of your lashes so they can stand out against the dark eye makeup. You may need more than one coat of mascara to get help your lashes stand out with the darker makeup. Make sure not to apply too much, though, or lashes may start to clump."

Before you apply any shadows to your eyes, dab on an eye primer. It will form a barrier between the oils in your lid and the shadow, so it stays looking fresh. Primer can also help intensify the shadows that you layer over it. If you don\u2019t have a specific eye primer on hand, apply a little concealer or foundation to your eyelids before using any eyeshadows.

Keep the shadow on the lid and crease area, so your brow bone remains brightened by the base shade. You may want to apply multiple layers of the medium dark shade to get it to the depth and intensity that you prefer. The pigment should be darkest near your lashes and fade gradually in the crease so that it blends seamlessly with the lighter shade."

Use a pointed crease brush to work the shade into the outer corner of the eye. Start at the outer edge of the lash line and create a diagonal line toward the end of your brow. When you reach the crease, drag the brush inward to darken up that area. You\u2019ll effectively create a \u201cV\u201d shape at the corner of your eye. Make sure to blend the dark shadow well, so there are no harsh lines or edges. You may want to switch to a clean, fluffy brush after you\u2019re done applying the shadow to soften it.

Smudge out the liner, and then press a powder shadow in a similar color to the liner over it with a small pencil brush to darken it up further. You can use a brush or a cotton swab to smudge the liner. It\u2019s best not to use your finger, though, because it can make the look seem a little messy.

        "It will form a barrier between the oils in your lid and the shadow, so it stays looking fresh.",
        "Primer can also help intensify the shadows that you layer over it.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a specific eye primer on hand, apply a little concealer or foundation to your eyelids before using any eyeshadows.",
        "Next, dust the lids with translucent powder to create a smooth base.",
        "Use a light base shade over the entire lid.",
        "To begin your smokey eye look, choose a light shade of powdered eyeshadow that flatters your skin tone, such as a white, ivory, cream, beige, or tan.",
        "Use a brush or a sponge-tip applicator to apply it over the entire eyelid, from your upper lashline to under your brow.",
        "Dab a little in the inner corner of your eyes as well.",
        "It\u2019s best to use a matte shadow as your base shade.",
        "Press a medium dark shade over the base of your eyelid.",
        "Start to add depth to your eye look by applying a medium dark tone to your eyelid with a flat shader brush or a sponge-tip applicator.",
        "Keep the shadow on the lid and crease area, so your brow bone remains brightened by the base shade.",
        "You may want to apply multiple layers of the medium dark shade to get it to the depth and intensity that you prefer.",
        "The pigment should be darkest near your lashes and fade gradually in the crease so that it blends seamlessly with the lighter shade.",
        "Apply the darkest shade to the outer corner and crease.",
        "To really make your smokey eye look sultry and dramatic, you\u2019ll want to work in an even darker shade.",
        "Use a pointed crease brush to work the shade into the outer corner of the eye.",
        "Start at the outer edge of the lash line and create a diagonal line toward the end of your brow.",
        "When you reach the crease, drag the brush inward to darken up that area.",
        "You\u2019ll effectively create a \u201cV\u201d shape at the corner of your eye.",
        "Make sure to blend the dark shadow well, so there are no harsh lines or edges.",
        "You may want to switch to a clean, fluffy brush after you\u2019re done applying the shadow to soften it.",
        "If the dark shadow isn\u2019t as dark as you\u2019d like, layer it until you build it up to the intensity that you prefer.",
        "Line your upper lashline.",
        "Use a creamy eyeliner pencil in black or another dark shade to add definition to your upper lashes, moving from the outer corner to the inner corner.",
        "The color should be at least as dark as your darkest shadow, if not darker.",
        "Smudge out the liner, and then press a powder shadow in a similar color to the liner over it with a small pencil brush to darken it up further.",
        "You can use a brush or a cotton swab to smudge the liner.",
        "It\u2019s best not to use your finger, though, because it can make the look seem a little messy.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a brush or cotton swab, a sponge tip applicator can work.",
        "Add liner to your lower lashline.",
        "With the same pencil that you used on your upper lashline, line your lower lashes.",
        "Keep the liner as close to your lashline as possible, though.",
        "Next, use a brush or cotton swab to soften the line to give it a smokier look.",
        "If you want a really sultry smokey eye, consider applying the dark eyeliner to your inside rim of your lower lash line, also known as the water line.",
        "Pull lightly on your lower lid to expose the area, and gently run the liner over it.",
        "Apply mascara or false lashes.",
        "Finish off your smokey eye by defining your lashes.",
        "Use an eyelash curler to curl your lashes, and apply several coats of your favorite black mascara.",
        "If you\u2019ve used very dark shadows or just want a bolder look, though, you may want to Apply False Eyelashes to really add drama.",
        "Don't forget to apply a little mascara to your lower lashes too.",
        "Doing the Rest of Your Makeup Apply your eye makeup first.",
        "Many people start with their face makeup, and move onto the eyes later.",
        "However, you often get fallout on your cheeks from the shadows that you\u2019re applying to your eyes.",
        "When you\u2019re using really dark shadows, it can be difficult to get rid of the specks on your face without ruining your foundation and concealer.",
        "That\u2019s why it\u2019s best to do your eye makeup first and then apply your face products.",
        "If you just prefer to do your face makeup first, apply a generous amount of loose translucent powder beneath your eyes before applying your shadow.",
        "The powder will catch any fallout, and you can just sweep it away with a brush when you\u2019re finished with your eyes.",
        "Keep the rest of your makeup subtle.",
        "When you\u2019re wearing a bold, smokey eye, it\u2019s usually best to tone down the rest of your look.",
        "That means wearing a bright red lip or super shimmery blush with a dramatic black smokey eye isn\u2019t always the best choice.",
        "Instead, opt for light, neutral shades, such as a nude lip color and a matte neutral blush, so your eyes are the star of your look.",
        "Keep in mind that they are no rules in makeup.",
        "If you feel like wearing a bold red lip with your smokey eye, go for it.",
        "However, if you\u2019re new to smokey eye looks, it\u2019s best to start slow with a soft pink or nude lip.",
        "Add color to your cheeks.",
        "While you typically don\u2019t want to go too bold with the rest of your makeup, it\u2019s important to add some color to your face with a smokey eye.",
        "That\u2019s because the dark eyeshadows can make you look pale and almost sickly.",
        "Apply a rosy or peachy blush to the apples of your cheeks and blend it back toward your hairline to liven up your skin.",
        "If you\u2019re not a fan of blush, swap it for your favorite bronzer.",
        "Dust it over the tops of your cheekbones to add warmth and color to your skin."
