You only need to apply the bitter apple spray to the lower parts of the furniture that your rabbit can reach. Bitter apple spray is safe to use with rabbits. Bitter apple spray prevents rabbits from chewing as it has a bad flavor that your rabbit won\u2019t like. While bitter apple spray is generally considered to be very effective against chewing, some rabbits do appear to like the taste. If the bitter apple spray doesn\u2019t stop your rabbit from chewing, wrap chair and table legs with cardboard. This means that your rabbit will chew through the cardboard rather than the wood. Alternatively, you can place PVC tubing around wooden furniture legs. The PVC tubing will be too difficult for your rabbit to bite through. It\u2019s natural for rabbits to chew, so stopping all chewing activity may not be possible."

Set a piece of plastic carpet runner under every piece of furniture that you cannot easily see under, but that your rabbit is able to fit under. Make sure that the spiked side is facing up as this will deter your rabbit from walking over it. Plastic carpet runners are sheets of flexible plastic that are placed over the carpet to protect it. Normally, the spikes face down into the carpet to hold the runner in place. Rabbits love to nest in soft upholstery such as beds and couches, as these spaces are warm and dark, and feel secure. If you have a recliner, always check underneath before you put it down. If you are concerned about your rabbit being underneath the recliner, tightly stuff old blankets and towels in the space so that your rabbit cannot get in."
