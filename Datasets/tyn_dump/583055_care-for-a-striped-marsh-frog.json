If you\u2019re only keeping 1 marsh frog, you can use a smaller tank that\u2019s about 24 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 13 in (61 \u00d7 33 \u00d7 33 cm). The enclosure must be waterproof, escape-proof, and non-toxic. Make sure that the tank has 1 elevated side to create 2 sections: a higher section for substrate and a lower section for water. These 2 sections are typically the same size, with the substrate half elevated by 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm). In most divided tanks, the substrate will taper down as it approaches the low side of the tank. A 30 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 12 in (76 \u00d7 30 \u00d7 30 cm) long tank is a standard medium-sized aquarium. The size is referred to as a \u201c30 long,\u201d and pet-store owners will know what you\u2019re referring to if you use that term. To keep frogs from getting out (and unwanted insects from getting in), pick up a steel or aluminum flyscreen to rest on top of the tank. Striped marsh frogs can jump quite high. To prevent frog escapes, tape down any loose, non-locking lids. Although striped marsh frogs get along well with other frogs of the same species, it's unwise to keep them in the same tank as frogs of different species. Also avoid keeping fish in the water half of the frog tank, since the frogs will eat them."

        "Plants that typically thrive in these conditions include orchids, bromeliads, ficus, Mondo grass, and types of moss.",
        "Avoid planting calla lilies or oleander, as these plants are poisonous to frogs.",
        "If you prefer not to have to care for and water the plants in the frog terrarium, purchase plastic plants from a pet store instead.",
        "Provide dechlorinated water so the frog can swim in its tank.",
        "Frogs are amphibious animals and need constant access to a body of water.",
        "Fill the lower side of the divided tank with room-temperature, dechlorinated water.",
        "The water should be at least 2 in (5.1 cm) deep.",
        "Change this water at least twice a week by siphoning out old water and adding new water.",
        "Replace 100% of the water each time you change it.",
        "Striped marsh frogs do not like currents in the water that they lay in, so don\u2019t install a water filter.",
        "Set 3-4 stones and other resting places in the water and a ramp up to the land area of the tank.",
        "You can purchase plastic resting decorations and a plastic ramp at any large pet store.",
        "Install 3-6 small hiding places for your frog to conceal itself behind.",
        "Frogs like hiding places, so set half a dozen small rocks, leaf litter, and logs across the substrate.",
        "Purchase objects in a variety of sizes so your frog can hide near those it likes best.",
        "For example, choose a 2 in \u00d7 4 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 10.2 cm) log and a 5 in \u00d7 5 in (13 cm \u00d7 13 cm) rock.",
        "These objects will help recreate the frog\u2019s natural habitat and will give it places to sleep, digest its food, and get out of the light if it begins to overheat.",
        "You can purchase plastic versions of all of these objects at a large pet store.",
        "They'll most likely be in the aquarium section.",
        "Locate the frog tank in a cool part of your home.",
        "Marsh frogs can tolerate a range of temperatures and, in most cases, don\u2019t need to be heated.",
        "The temperature in the tank should not drop below 46 \u00b0F (8 \u00b0C) and not go above 77 \u00b0F (25 \u00b0C).",
        "Ideally, the temperature in the tank should hover around 59\u201368 \u00b0F (15\u201320 \u00b0C).",
        "If the temperature in the tank slips below 46 \u00b0F (8 \u00b0C) in the winter, clip a heat lamp on to the side of the tank.",
        "Direct the heat towards a patch of substrate so the frog can lie there and warm up.",
        "It's unlikely that the water will reach a temperature that's too high or too low for the frogs, even when the tank is heated.",
        "However, to avoid the risk of overheating, don't set the tank in an area that receives direct sunlight for more than 1-2 hours.",
        "Maintaining the Frog Tank Light the frog tank for at least 6\u20138 hours a day.",
        "When setting up the tank, purchase a fluorescent light that either clips on to the top of the tank or rests over the enclosure as part of an add-on roof.",
        "Keep the fluorescent light on for at least 6\u20138 hours of the day.",
        "If you\u2019d rather not have to remember to regularly turn the light on and off, purchase a timer and set it so that the light is on during regular daylight hours.",
        "Unlike various other types of frogs and amphibians kept in captivity, striped marsh frogs do not need special UV lighting.",
        "Rinse the substrate 2-3 times per week to keep it clean and moist.",
        "If the substrate is left for too long, unhealthy bacteria will build up.",
        "To keep the substrate clean, pour 1 litre (0.26 US gal) of water over it 2-3 times a week.",
        "You don't need to remove the substrate from the tank in order to do this, since the water will drain through the substrate.",
        "If you maintain the substrate, you won\u2019t need to replace it more than 2 times a year.",
        "Plan to change the substrate, for example, once in spring and once in fall, even if you don't note any visual differences at these times.",
        "Spray the plants and substrate with water 3\u20134 times weekly.",
        "In order to keep the humidity high in the frog\u2019s tank and to prevent the soil from drying out, spray water over the interior of the tank using an ordinary spray bottle.",
        "Spritz the substrate and plants half a dozen times with dechlorinated water, but avoid spraying water directly onto the frog.",
        "Also take the time to spray the substrate in your tank each time that you change out the water.",
        "Clean the tank twice each month with warm tap water.",
        "Remove all of the items from your frog\u2019s tank\u2014including any plastic plants and objects, stones, etc.\u2014and run them under warm tap water.",
        "Scrub the items with a sponge to remove bacteria and residue.",
        "Then use the same sponge to wipe down the inner walls of the frog\u2019s tank.",
        "Avoid using cleaning products\u2014even mild ones\u2014as they can irritate the frog\u2019s sensitive skin.",
        "If you\u2019re concerned that your frog may try to escape as you clean its tank, place it into a smaller backup tank (without substrate and water).",
        "The frog will be fine in this tank during the 20-30 minutes it'll take you to clean the main tank.",
        "Feeding Marsh Frogs Dust insects with a vitamin mixture before feeding your frog.",
        "When kept in captivity, frogs aren\u2019t able to produce calcium and other healthy compounds on their own.",
        "So, before feeding your frog each day, place 5\u201310 insects in a plastic bag.",
        "Dump in 1 small spoonful each of multivitamin powder and calcium powder.",
        "Then, shake the bag for 30 seconds until the insects are fully coated.",
        "Purchase live insects, calcium powder, and multivitamin powder at a local pet store.",
        "Most pet stores sell mixtures of vitamins that have been specifically designed to provide the nutrients that frogs need, since their dietary needs may be different than those of reptiles and other amphibians.",
        "If you\u2019d rather not dust the insects yourself, most pet stores will have a bin of live insects that have already been dusted with a powder containing calcium and other vitamins and nutrients.",
        "Keep food constantly available for juvenile marsh frogs.",
        "Juvenile marsh frogs eat frequently and have large appetites since their bodies are still growing.",
        "So, keep insects constantly available for a juvenile frog to eat.",
        "Check the tank 4\u20135 times daily to make sure that there are insects inside from the previous feeding and, if there are not, deposit 6-7 insects on the substrate.",
        "Suitable foods for young frogs include small insects like crickets, house flies, and fruit flies.",
        "Marsh frogs are considered juvenile until they reach sexual maturity at 5 months of age.",
        "Make sure to always dust the insects with calcium and vitamin powders before feeding your juvenile frogs!",
        "Feed a mature marsh frog insects 2 or 3 times a week.",
        "Frogs older than 5 months will eat large meals every 3 or 4 days.",
        "So, each time you feed your marsh frog, give it 12-15 insects and adjust the amount you feed once you get a sense of the frog\u2019s appetite.",
        "Do this 2\u20133 times a week.",
        "Older frogs have a habit of eating anything they can fit in their mouths, so you can give them fairly large insects (e.g., grasshoppers or cockroaches) to eat.",
        "You can purchase live insects and other frog-friendly foods at a local pet store.",
        "At the end of each day, remember to remove all dead food from the tank!",
        "Otherwise, it will begin to decay or may attract unwanted insects.",
        "Use a pair of tweezers to feed insects to a mature frog.",
        "To feed a mature marsh frog, pick up each individual insect with a pair of tweezers.",
        "Take the top off of the frog enclosure, and lower the insect towards the waiting frog.",
        "Try placing each insect directly into the frog\u2019s mouth or onto the ground 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) away.",
        "Since they\u2019ll be preoccupied with eating the insects, your marsh frogs shouldn\u2019t try to escape the tank while you\u2019re feeding them.",
        "You can try to feed your juvenile frogs in the same way.",
        "However, since they need a constant food supply, it may be more practical to deposit 6-7 insects in the tank all at once."
