Choose educational programming with limited or no advertising, and watch along with them whenever possible. To make things a bit more engaging, help them set up their dolls or stuffed animals in chairs to create a \"movie theater.\" You might even make up tickets to sell for the show! Or, drag out some home movies for them to watch. Toddlers are often fascinated by seeing themselves on the big screen, and they might be especially intrigued by seeing themselves as a tiny baby!"

When they suddenly lose interest in the pots and pans they were banging on, for example, have some building blocks or art supplies ready to go. There is one thing that can invariably keep a toddler occupied for a long stretch of time\u2014you! Make the most of the full attention your toddler wants to give you\u2014they'll be off to school and making friends before you know it! Rely on TV or screen time only as a temporary last resort. Plopping a toddler in front of a TV or other screen to keep them occupied should only be a short-term alternative when you don't have better options. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no screen time for kids under 18 months, very limited screen time with an adult watching along at 18-24 months, and no more than 1 hour per day of solo screen time from 2-5 years. Choose educational programming with limited or no advertising, and watch along with them whenever possible. To make things a bit more engaging, help them set up their dolls or stuffed animals in chairs to create a \"movie theater.\" You might even make up tickets to sell for the show! Or, drag out some home movies for them to watch. Toddlers are often fascinated by seeing themselves on the big screen, and they might be especially intrigued by seeing themselves as a tiny baby!",
