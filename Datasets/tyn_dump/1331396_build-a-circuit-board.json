You can do this either using a Sharpie for a simple circuit or a printed out version from a computer program. Only one of these is needed, so select according to your preference. Draw the circuit schematic on either graph paper or a simulation programs such as MultiSim or Eagle CAD. The schematic should contain a detailed description of all parts, as well as easy to follow connections. If a simulation program is being used, test the circuit thoroughly in the simulated environment. If no simulation program is used, assemble and test one or more prototypes of the circuit on a breadboard. Breadboards are very easy to use, and allow one to view the results of a circuit in real time without the need for solder or permanent etches. Make sure the circuit functions on the breadboard, or in the simulation software.  Acquire a circuit board.

Etching Put on old clothes, gloves and safety goggles.  Warm the ferric chloride, stored in a non-corrosive jar and sealed with a non-corrosive lid, in a bucket of warm water. Do not heat it above 115 F (46 C) to prevent toxic fumes from being released. Pour only enough ferric chloride to fill a plastic tray that has plastic risers in it to rest the circuit board on. Be sure to do this in a well-ventilated space. Use plastic tongs to lay the circuit board face down on the risers in the tray. Allow 5 to 20 minutes, depending on the size of your circuit board, for the exposed copper to drop off the board as it etches away. Use the plastic tongs to agitate the board and tray to allow for faster etching if necessary. Wash all the etching equipment and the circuit board thoroughly with plenty of running water.  Drill 0.03 inch (0.8 mm) lead component holes into your circuit board with high-speed steel or carbide drill bits. Wear safety goggles and a protective mask to protect your eyes and lungs while you drill. Scrub the board clean with a scouring pad and running water. Add your board's electrical components and solder them into place.
