If you don\u2019t have plain Greek yogurt, you can substitute it with 1/3 cup (80 mL) of milk or stock. If you\u2019re using white bread instead of store-bought breadcrumbs, tear up the slices and pulse the pieces in a food processor until you\u2019ve formed coarse breadcrumbs. You can also toast the bread before tearing and pulsing it. A panade will make your patties super juicy, but you can skip this step if you want to cut some calories."
