        "Remove the plastic after a week, mist it with water, and proceed.The plastic keeps the moisture in the base layer from evaporating too fast, which can weaken the stucco.",
        "Repeat the process to add another layer of base layer stucco.",
        "Mix up another batch of base coat stucco using the exact same recipe you did for the first.",
        "Apply it using your brick trowel, then pack it down and smooth it out until it is just barely lower than the edges of the surrounding stucco using your finishing trowel.",
        "Score the surface of the second coat when it loses its wet sheen, then tape plastic over it again, but leave it for just 3 days.Adding stucco in 3 layers will ensure that it cures properly so it\u2019s strong and long-lasting.",
        "Applying the Finish Coat Remove the plastic sheet after 3 days and mist the second coat.",
        "Let the second coat of stucco cure for just 3 days this time.",
        "Take off the plastic sheet after 3 days, mist it with water to moisten it, and proceed.",
        "Mix a batch of finish coat stucco in your wheelbarrow.",
        "Pour 1 part plastic cement and 4 parts masonry sand into a wheelbarrow and blend everything together with a mason\u2019s hoe.",
        "Add water a little at a time, stirring as you go, until it is a pudding-like consistency.You can use a pre-mixed stucco finish coat if you want and just add water.",
        "The finish coat just has more sand than the base coat.",
        "Apply the finish coat using your brick trowel.",
        "Fill the patch in with the finish coat stucco up to the level of the surrounding old stucco.",
        "Smooth it out and blend it in around the edges by dragging your trowel out across the surrounding stucco.Stucco can have many different textures, so you can experiment to give the finish coat the look that you want.",
        "For example, if the old stucco has prominent blobs of texture, try scooping up tiny bits of stucco on the tip of your trowel and flicking them against the patch to give it more texture.",
        "Wait 60-90 days before painting the patched stucco.",
        "The average drying time for stucco is 90 days, but it may dry faster if the conditions are warm and dry.",
        "Wait at least 60 days if you are in a hot, dry climate, and about 90 days if you are in a humid or cold and moist climate.Even if the stucco feels dry and hard to the touch, it can still be in the process of curing.",
        "The drying process goes very slowly, which is what makes stucco durable, so don\u2019t rush into painting it."
