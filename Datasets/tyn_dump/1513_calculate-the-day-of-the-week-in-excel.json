To add additional date info, use the following conventions, in any order:\n\nTime: hh:mm:ss will give you the full time. You can also enter any part of that for more abbreviated time displays. Day of week: as described above, ddd gives you the abbreviated day name, and dddd gives you the full day name. Date: dd will give you the date with a leading zero for the 1st through the 9th. A single d will drop the leading zero. Month: mmm will give you the abbreviated month, and mmmm will give you the month spelled out. Year: For just the decade, use yy. For the complete year, use yyyy. For example, to have field A1 (as above) read as \"Wed, 7 Nov., 2012\" you would enter \"=TEXT((A1), \"ddd, d mmm., yyyy\"). Make sure you include the quotes, and that your parentheses are balanced (as many open ones as closed ones)."
