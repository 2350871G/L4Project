Once the foal is moving, walk around the pen with your helper right behind the foal, to give him a tap if he stops. When pulling his head to the side to turn, do not give one continuous pull; remember, always short tugs, and stop immediately when he obeys. After around ten minutes of leading, stop and take the halter off and praise your foal. Only stop on a good note, not if your foal has just stopped on his own, or if he had just resisted and pulled against you. If he does this, correct him by giving him a tug and the command to keep going. It is best to give your foal two lessons a day, ten minutes long each. Make sure to stop before your foal starts to get bored, so he doesn't act up. Foals are young, and have very short attention spans. A bored foal will resist to whatever you want to teach him, and he might react by nipping, pulling against you, or kicking. Keep lessons at 10 minutes or less to keep this from happening. Many short lessons are way better then one long lesson. After your foal will easily lead without having a helper behind to encourage him, and when he will listen to your commands immediately, you have successfully trained your foal to lead! Remember to have lots of patience, and most of all, enjoy your foal!"
