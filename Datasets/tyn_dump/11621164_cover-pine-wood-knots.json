If you find any, hold a heat gun 6\u20138 inches (15\u201320 cm) away from the spot and wave it back and forth for 20-30 seconds. The hot air will cause the sticky fluid to harden rapidly, allowing it to be sanded away with ease. A hair dryer set to the highest heat setting may also help dry up flowing resin if you don\u2019t have a heat gun handy.

Scuffing up the existing paint or stain will create a grippier base surface, helping your filler materials stick and set up better. While you\u2019re at it, be sure to remove any loose wood chunks or splinters you find in the area surrounding the knot. A pair of tweezers can come in handy for this. Simply slapping an extra layer of paint or stain onto a bleeding pine knot won\u2019t cut it. The natural oils and resins in softwoods are so potent and persistent that they can leach through multiple coats of finish."
