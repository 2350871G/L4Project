Then, chop the onion into small pieces. Since onion shrinks when it cooks, don't worry about chopping it too finely at this point.

Choose a large, deep skillet and pour in a generous amount of palm oil, about 2 tablespoons (30 mL) to begin with. Place the skillet over a large burner, and turn the heat up to medium-high. Saut\u00e9e the chopped onion in the palm oil. Once the palm oil is hot, scrape the chopped onion off of your cutting board and into the skillet.

Stir the tomatoes and peppers regularly to prevent them from burning or sticking to the pan. The tomatoes and peppers are cooked when they look browned and crisp. Add the stock, chili powder, and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) salt to the skillet. Once the tomatoes and peppers have cooked, pour the leftover meat stock into the skillet. Add your 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of chili powder and another 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of salt. Use your wooden spatula to mix the ingredients together. Simmer for 5 minutes. Turn the burner down to medium-low heat and let the soup simmer. Leave the lid off of the skillet while the efo riro simmers, so excess moisture evaporates. Adding the Meat and Spinach Stir in the fried meat. After the 5 minutes have passed, add the blend of fried meats to the deep skillet. Use your spatula or a spoon to blend the meat in with the vegetable ingredients. If you opted to cook tilapia and shrimp instead of lamb and tripe, set these aside. Do not add them to the efo riro yet. Stir in the blanched spinach. Add the blanched fresh spinach (or frozen spinach) that you set aside earlier.
