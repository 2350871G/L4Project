Pump the stain onto the concrete using even strokes to make sure the surface is complete coated, but without creating any puddles. Allow the first round of spraying to set, and then look for any areas that are lighter than you prefer. Administer a second and even a third coat of the stain to create the look you want."

A paint roller made with synthetic fiber rather than cotton fiber will make it possible to apply the sealant evenly and avoid streaking.
