    "text": " Making a Simple Cupcake Open up the diaper, so that it is a long strip, and position it horizontally. Make sure that the inside of the diaper is facing you. Do not unfold the adhesive flaps. Try to use a plain white diaper; this way, it will look more like frosting. Fold the diaper in half lengthwise. Keep the folded edge at the top, and the elastic edges at the bottom. Start rolling the diaper tightly from one end to the other. Try to roll at a slight angle, so that your cupcake will have a nice peak. Make sure that the folded edge is making the peak, and not the elastic edge. Wrap a rubber band around the middle of the diaper to hold it together. Don't worry about what the rubber band looks like. You will be covering it up later. Gently push on the bottom of the roll to form the peak, if needed. If the cupcake is still too flat for you, turn the cupcake so that the bottom, elastic edge is facing you, gently poke the center of the spiral with your finger. This will push the peak out further. Tie a ribbon around the rubber band to hide it. You can also use an elastic baby hair tie or headband instead.

A cupcake box from a baker or a tiered cupcake stand would make a wonderful touch! Making a Fancy Cupcake Roll a pair of baby socks up, starting from the toes and ending at the heels. Keep the socks together as you roll them. The tip of the socks will stick out of the top of the cupcake and look like a little decoration. Choose a solid-colored baby sock that contrasts with the diaper. Red, pink, or light blue would look great! Open up a diaper, then fold it in half lengthwise. Keep the folded edge at the top and the elastic edge at the bottom. Use a plain, white diaper if you can; this way, it will look even more like frosting. Position the rolled up baby socks at one end of the folded diaper. Make sure that the toe part of the sock is facing upward and sticking out over the edge of the folded diaper. The other end of the sock roll should be lined up with the bottom (elastic) edge of the diaper. Start rolling the diaper tightly around the sock. This will make the frosting part of the cupcake. If you'd like to, you can roll it at slight angle so that it creates a peak. Wrap a rubber band around the center of the cupcake. If you need to, use two rubber bands, one towards the top and one towards the bottom, for extra support. Don't worry about what the rubber band looks like; you will be covering it up. Set the cupcake aside when you are done. Fold a baby washcloth lengthwise so that it is the same height as the rolled up diaper. You may have the fold the washcloth into thirds.

Choose a washcloth that matches the baby's gender or the theme color of the baby shower. Wrap the washcloth around the rolled up diaper, and secure it with another rubber band. Keep the folded edge of the wash cloth at the top, and the loose edge towards the bottom. Make sure that the bottom of the washcloth is aligned with the bottom of the cupcake. Once you have the washcloth wrapped around the diaper, secure it around the middle with a rubber band. Cover the rubber band with a pretty ribbon. You can also use an elastic baby headband or hair tie as well. Try to match the ribbon to the baby's gender: pink for a girl and light blue for a boy. If you don't know the baby's gender, consider matching the ribbon to the theme color of the baby shower instead. The width of the ribbon does not matter, but it shouldn't be too thick or too thin.
