Overall, there will be 2 knots in your turban. The first will be at the front, and the second will be at the base of your head. Tuck in the loose ends at the front and back of the turban. Fold the small triangle of fabric by your forehead over the knot at the front of the turban. Repeat this with any loose ends of fabric at the back to make the turban feel tight. Making a Turban Headband Measure the circumference of your head and add on 6 in (15 cm) to it. Use a tape measure to measure from the nape of your neck to just above your forehead. Then add 6 in (15 cm) to the measurement that you took. This means that if you\u2019re head circumference was 22 in (56 cm), your final measurement will be 28 in (71 cm). Measure out a rectangle on a 36 in (91 cm) length of fabric. Fold your fabric in half. Measure out a rectangle that is your final head measurement across by 4.5 in (11 cm) wide. Use chalk to mark out the rectangle. Use pins to hold the folded fabric together while you are measuring it out.

Approximately 36 in (91 cm) will work well for making a few headbands, depending on the width of the fabric. Cut out the rectangle. Use fabric scissors to cut around the chalk outline that you made. Keep the pins holding the folded fabric together while you cut out the rectangle. Remove the pins holding the fabric together once you have finished cutting out the rectangle. Wrap the headband around your head. Center the middle of the fabric at the nape of your neck. Tie the 2 sides in a knot just above your forehead. Keep the fabric folded in half as you tie it around your head to make the headband thicker. The knot will create a bow-like shape just above your forehead. Making a 1940s Vintage Costume Turban Get a scarf that is approximately 59 in (1.5 m) long. Find a fabric that isn't slippery like silk to help your turban stay secure. If possible, use a scarf that matches the color or pattern of your outfit to create a true vintage style. Place the middle of the scarf over your hair with the front edge folded in. Estimate where the middle of the length of the scarf is. Place this edge against your forehead. Fold this edge under slightly to create a neat line. The opposite edge of the scarf should brush against the nape of your neck. Tie the sides of the scarf at the back of your head. Gently bring the sides of the scarf around your head.

Create a loop with the other side. Tuck the other side of the scarf behind the knot. Leave it only halfway pulled through again to create another loop. Also fan this loop out to create the other half of the bow. Tuck the loose ends into the turban. Gather each loose end of scarf and tuck these behind the knot. You can also tuck these under the fabric that's next to the knot if that fits better. Make sure that you tuck in each loose end tightly to keep your turban secure. Decorate the turban with a small cluster of flowers. Use brightly colored flowers to embellish your 1940s style turban. Tuck the flowers into the knot so that they are just in front of the bow. Flowers that contrast with the scarf color work the best. You can use real flowers if you prefer, otherwise artificial flowers will also work well as they will last for many future costumes!",
