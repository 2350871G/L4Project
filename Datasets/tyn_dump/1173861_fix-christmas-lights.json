If you don't feel comfortable removing light bulb sockets, then you can just leave a light bulb in the socket or cover it with electric tape to prevent an electric shock.) Follow this method:\nUnplug the lights. Using wire cutters, cut the wire on either side of the broken socket. (Do not cut the other two wires.) With a wire stripper, strip about \u00bd inch (1.25cm) of insulation from each cut end. Twist the two strands of wire together. Get a twist connector from an electronics store (a small conical cap).

        "Place the detector on this wire about halfway along the string, between two bulbs.",
        "(If your tool has a small hole for a detector, place a light bulb into the hole instead.)",
        "If the tool hums or lights up (depending on model), the problem is in the half of the string farthest from the plug.",
        "If there is no hum or light, the problem is in the half closest to the plug.",
        "Move the tool to the middle of the problem area and test again, narrowing it down to \u00bc of the string.",
        "Repeat until you find a bulb with current on one side of it and no current on the other.",
        "Mark this bulb with tape so you don't lose track, then replace this bulb as described below.",
        "Finding the Dead Bulb (DIY) Understand the goal.",
        "Each Christmas light bulb has a \"shunt\" that is supposed to close the gap when the bulb burns out.",
        "This often fails, but a small surge of current can trigger this and put your lights back on.",
        "This will not work every time, especially with this DIY approach.",
        "If you're looking for quick results, try the methods above instead.",
        "Find a lighter operated by button.",
        "This type of lighter has a piezoelectric crystal which creates a spark when pressed.",
        "Do not use the type with a metal wheel, which creates the spark through friction.",
        "Empty the lighter of fuel.",
        "If the lighter is disposable, just burn the fuel away.",
        "If the lighter is refillable, transfer the lighter fluid to another lighter, or to a sealed, clearly labeled fire-proof container.",
        "Never dispose of lighter fluid in a drain or in household trash.",
        "Remove the piezo igniter.",
        "Pry apart the plastic cover, then lift out the igniter with a pair of needle nose pliers.",
        "The piezo igniter includes a button, and two tiny metal or plastic prongs.",
        "When the button is pressed, a spark jumps between these prongs.",
        "The spark is not dangerous, but it will give you a mild electric shock.",
        "More importantly, it could ignite fumes and light a small flame.",
        "Work over a nonflammable surface and keep your fingers and face away from the sparker during removal.",
        "Zap the prongs of the light string.",
        "Position the two prongs of the sparker against the two prongs of the Christmas light plug.",
        "Push the button about 10\u201320 times.",
        "You should hear a click and see a spark each time.",
        "If it's too hard to line up the prongs, connect them with insulated wires.",
        "Plug in your lights.",
        "If all went well, the lights should now light up.",
        "There will be one or two dead bulbs, which should be replaced as described below.",
        "Leaving the dead bulbs on will cause the other bulbs to burn out sooner.",
        "Replacing Individual Bulbs Twist the light bulb to check the connection.",
        "This is rarely the problem, but it only takes a second to check.",
        "Twist the light bulb gently to tighten it in position.",
        "If the bulb moved noticeably, plug in the lights and see if a loose connection was causing the issue.",
        "Assuming the bulb is still out, continue to the next step.",
        "If you have many lights, buy a string of bulbs of the same brand and type.",
        "Keep it in storage and twist off the bulbs to use as replacements when you need them.",
        "Purchase replacement bulbs.",
        "If you don't have any replacements, take along the burnt-out bulbs to a hardware store, pharmacy, or home improvement store.",
        "Look for bulbs that match as closely as possible.",
        "Ideally, check the packaging your lights came in to see what type of bulb is needed.",
        "Some bulbs are flashers, and when installed, will cause lights to flash on and off.",
        "There is no need to have two flashers on the same circuit, as they may cause unusual on / off timings.",
        "Remove each of the blown-out Christmas light bulbs.",
        "Use your thumb and index finger to delicately put pressure on each of the broken light's plastic base, to remove the fragile bulbs.",
        "If you have a Christmas light repair tool, it may come with a small grip for this purpose.",
        "In order to remove a broken Christmas bulb from its socket, find the two copper wires that sit on the base of the old bulb, noting their position on the base.",
        "Push both of the copper wires down, so that they are pointing towards your floor, and the bulb is pointing towards the ceiling.",
        "Pull upward on the bulb, and it should now be separated from the light's base.",
        "Insert the replacement bulb into the old bulb's socket.",
        "Make sure the two copper wires are completely aligned with the holes in the bulb's base.",
        "Once the bulb is fully seated in the base, fold the copper wires against the base in the same position as noted above.",
        "Plug in your lights and watch them glow.",
        "If you used a continuity/voltage detector tool, and your lights still won't turn on, use the tool again.",
        "There may be a second burned-out bulb.",
        "These tools can only detect one burned out bulb at a time.",
        "Remove broken sockets.",
        "If a new bulb still won't light up, your socket may be corroded or the wire may be damaged nearby.",
        "Removing this is not as difficult as it sounds, although each bulb you remove will cause the remaining bulbs to burn more brightly and therefore burn out sooner though removing one or two bulbs should be fine.",
        "(Note that a damaged wire or a repair using this method, unless done well, may present an electric shock or fire hazard.",
        "If you don't feel comfortable removing light bulb sockets, then you can just leave a light bulb in the socket or cover it with electric tape to prevent an electric shock.)",
        "Follow this method:\nUnplug the lights.",
        "Using wire cutters, cut the wire on either side of the broken socket.",
        "(Do not cut the other two wires.)",
        "With a wire stripper, strip about \u00bd inch (1.25cm) of insulation from each cut end.",
        "Twist the two strands of wire together.",
        "Get a twist connector from an electronics store (a small conical cap).",
        "Twist this over the wire, holding it in place."
