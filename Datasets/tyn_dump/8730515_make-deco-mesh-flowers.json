Try to fold the corners in as evenly as possible, but don\u2019t worry about the petal shapes being perfect. The flower will have a more natural appearance if the petals are slightly irregular. Fold the mesh in half. Once the mesh square is resembles a bow tie, fold the pieces in half. Both of the \u201cpetals\u201d should point in the same direction so they can form the outer layer of the flower. Arranging the Large Petals Add glue to the center of a floral pin. To attach the petals to the foam disc that serves as the flower\u2019s base, you\u2019ll need U-shaped floral pins. Use a hot glue gun to add a dab of glue to the center of the pins so you don\u2019t have to worry about the petals coming loose. You can use straight floral pins to attach the petals as well. Be sure to add some glue just below the head of the pin, though, so the petals are secure. Pin the petal in place around edge of a foam disc. For the flower\u2019s base, you\u2019ll need a 6-inch (15-cm) styrofoam disc. With the glue on floral pin, insert it through the bottom of the petals and press it into the foam along the outer edge of the foam disc. You can move the mesh around to arrange the petals as you like, but wait 5 to 10 minutes after you pin them so the glue has time to set. Repeat the process until the entire outer edge of disc is lined. After you\u2019ve pinned the first set of petals to the foam disc, take another square of decorative mesh and repeat the entire process of folding and pinning it. Continue adding large squares of mesh until the entire outer edge of the foam disc is covered. Filling in the Flower's Center with Smaller Petals Cut the mesh into small squares. To fill in the center of the flower, you\u2019ll need smaller squares of mesh to form petals. Use the scissors to cut approximately 10 to 12 10-inch (25-cm) squares from the decorative mesh. Depending on the look that you\u2019re going for, you can either use the same color mesh as the outer layer of petals or choose a contrasting shade. White and yellow make ideal shades for the flower\u2019s center. Repeat the folding and gathering process. Just as with the large mesh squares, fold opposite corners of the smaller square in toward the center. Pinch the center with your fingers to gather it together and then fold it in half. Add glue to a floral pin and pin the petal in the center of the foam. Take another U-shaped floral pin and add a dab of glue to the center. Insert the pin into the center of the mesh petals and press it into the center of the foam disc. As with the larger petals, allow the hot glue to set for at least 5 minutes before you try to play with the arrangement of the smaller petals. Continue adding small petals until the center is full. Once you\u2019ve added the first set of smaller petals to the center of the flower, repeat the procedure of folding and pinning the small mesh squares. Keep adding the petals until the entire center is filled in. If you prefer, you can tuck the ends of the petals in the center of flower underneath to give it a puffed appearance. Adding Tubed Mesh to the Center of the Flower Cut small squares of mesh. If you prefer to fill in the center of your flower with tubed mesh, you still need to cut out squares from the mesh. Use scissors to create approximately 15 to 20 10-inch (25-cm) squares from the mesh. Because the tubes are more compact than the fluffier petals, you will need more squares to fill in the center of the flower. Roll the mesh into a tube and stick a pin in it. After you\u2019ve cut out all of the mesh squares, roll s square up into a tube. Next, take a straight floral pin and insert it the center of tube. Because the tubes are more compact, it isn\u2019t necessary to add hot glue to the pin. However, if you want to ensure that your flower is sturdy, you can add a dab below the head of the pin. Fold the tube in half and attach to the center of the flower. When the pin is in the center of the tube, fold the mesh in half to form two \u201cpetals.\u201d Press the pin into the foam disc at the center of the flower, making sure that it\u2019s secure.
