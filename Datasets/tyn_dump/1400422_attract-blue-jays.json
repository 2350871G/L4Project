For this reason, they will make good use of a flat nesting platform instead of a traditional house. The floor area should be no less than 8 inches (20 cm) by 8 inches (20 cm). It should be high off the ground, either mounted in a tree or on a pole. Whatever platform location you choose, make sure it is not prone to predators such as raccoons. Blue jays can build their nests anywhere from 5 feet (1.5 meters) to 50 feet (15 meters) above ground. You can also buy hanging feeders, like peanut wreaths, that are especially designed to attract birds like blue jays. You can also try a fun craft if you have kids or make it alone. Take a pinecone and cover it with peanut butter and bird seeds. Birds go crazy for them and you can sometimes find these things right in your very own home. Hanging feeders are more free-floating, making it harder for other animals like raccoons to get at. However, they are more unstable and larger birds may shy away from them."
