                    "description": "Any handheld clothing or upholstery steamer will work for this project. Hold the steamer 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) away from the window and steam the entire outside of the window first. Then, apply steam to the inside of the window. Work in long, sweeping motions from the top to the bottom and try to heat the pane of glass evenly.Variation: If you don\u2019t have a steamer, you can use a hairdryer or heat gun to loosen the adhesive instead. However, this takes longer, isn\u2019t as effective, and will probably leave behind a lot of glue that you\u2019ll need to clean off. Just be sure not to heat the glass so much that it breaks! Steaming the outside helps heat up the window enough for the adhesive to dissolve. You don\u2019t need to do this for the rear window of your vehicle or if the windows in your home are on the second level and you can\u2019t access them easily, though."

Chad Zani\t\t\tAuto Detailing Expert\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: Glass is difficult to scratch, so you can run a razor blade across the glass with a lubricant to remove the tint. You can also use a razor blade to remove the sticky residue that is left behind after the tint is gone. Another option to remove the sticky residue is using a citrus-based cleaner."
