    "text": " Using Pressure Obtain a heavy chair. Make sure you are able to lift at least one corner up easily. The chair does not have to be fancy, it can be a kitchen chair or a stationary desk chair. Avoid using plastic stools and mobile office chairs. Lift one corner of the chair. Ask for assistance if needed. Place the glue stick underneath the chair leg. Slowly lower the chair leg onto the glue stick cap. Apply a soft pressure using your hands. If the pressure is not strong enough, sit on the chair gently and ensure that you do not crack the cap of the glue stick. Stop when you hear a cracking sound, this should be the glue separating from the cap. Remove the glue stick from under the chair and pull the cap off. If the cap still remains stuck, apply more pressure using the chair. You can also apply more pressure using your hands. Wash the glue stick. Make sure you remove the sticky residue from using the glue. Using a damp sponge can help wipe off the excess residue. Using Boiling Water Boil water using a kettle or stove. A cup of water should be enough. Allow the water to cool slightly. Wait for the water to stop moving and making sizzling sounds. This is to ensure that the glue stick will not melt as soon as you place it into the boiling water. Pour the water into a small bowl. Place the cap end of the glue stick into the bowl and wait 30 seconds. Take the glue stick out of the water. Check to see if the glue residue has melted. Pull the cap off quickly before the residue hardens again. If the cap still remains on the glue stick, leave the glue stick in the water for longer at a higher temperature. Wipe off excess residue. Do this before the glue residue hardens again. Using a Sewing Pin Grab a strong, thin sewing pin or needle. Test to see if the pin is not flexible and doesn't break easily. Insert the pin between the cap and glue stick. Make sure the pin reaches the surface of the glue stick. Drag the pin across the gap between the cap and glue stick. Push hard while doing so to ensure the pin does not come out again. Break into small intervals to help the separation between the cap and glue stick. Clean both the pin and glue stick. If the pin has snapped or has been damaged, dispose of it as it will be useless for future use.",
