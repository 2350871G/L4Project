The natural thickness of the avocado opens up the entire spectrum of consistency. Add a small amount, blend it up, and decide whether or not you'd like to add more. Give it a taste test, too! It probably goes without saying that the thicker and richer your milk, the thicker and richer the final taste will be. Whole milk and avocado will be more smoothie-like while almond milk and avocado will be thinner -- and have a completely different taste."
