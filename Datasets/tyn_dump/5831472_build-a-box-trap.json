The items are: a hammer, small box of 8 penny (1 and \u00bd inch galvanized) nails, one 10 foot long pine (1 inch x 8 inch) wood plank, circular saw, jig saw, safety goggles, tape measure, pencil, speed or \u201cT\u201d square, drill, 1 inch paddle bit, wire (old phone cord would work), a wooden dowel (approximately broom handle width) 3 feet in length (long enough for a 18 inch and 11 inch sections), bait can, and some form of bait. Cut the materials to size. Using the circular saw, cut the 1 x 8 pine plank into: three lengths of 2 feet (bottom and side boards), 1 length of 22 inches (top board), one length of 9 inches (back board), one length of 10 inches (door board), four lengths of 1 inch (rail boards), and one length of 2 inches (fulcrum board). Then cut the wooden dowel into one length of 11 inches (trigger) and one length of 18 inches (lever).  Lastly, cut two 8 inch lengths of the wire.  Attach the rails to create a channel for the door. Using two of the three two foot lengths, attach the rails (four 1 inch length) to the front of the side pieces. This is done by first nailing the 1 inch length flush with the end of the side board but raised \u00be inches above the top, use at least two nails per rail. The second rail is spaced 1 inch from the initial rail and runs parallel to it. Using a speed-square will assist with correct spacing.

The ends of the bottom and side board should be flush with one another. Nail the two boards together, making sure to drive no less than four nails through the bottom board into the right side board.

Note that the ends of the side of the end of the side and bottom boards should be flush. Attach the back board. Place the back end of the trap toward the assembler. Position the 9 inch length so that it is flush with the bottom and side boards, but uneven with the top leaving it \u00be inches above the top of the side boards. This will allow the top board to be flush with the back board once it is attached.

The depth of the partial hole should be approximately \u00bd inch and should not completely penetrate the board. With the partially drilled hole facing inward slide the door into the rail channels, making sure the door smoothly slides up and down. Prepare the trigger dowel. Drill a hole, 1inch from the end of the trigger dowel, using an 1/8 inch bit; making sure the hole is equal distance from each side. Place one of the two wires through the hole and knot is on one end. A notch that goes halfway through the trigger dowel is cut 5 inches from the bait end and continues 2 inches toward the lever end. Make sure that the notch can catch onto the underside of the top board, but will easily be tripped. Prepare the lever dowel. Drill a hole, using an 1/8 inch bit, 1 inch from the end of the lever dowel. Place the wire, previously run through the trigger dowel, through the lever dowel hole and knot the wire so the trigger and lever are closely connected; making sure the ends of the two dowels do not bind.
