Fountain pens are versatile and good for on-the-go calligraphy, but straight and oblique holders for nibs (which are then dipped in ink) are the traditional standard.

Purchase smooth, non-fibrous paper, like Rhodia Lined Paper. Most kinds of cartridge paper work as well and are relatively inexpensive. Each ink will have unique features.
