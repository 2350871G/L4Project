You can take the following steps to try to determine where the problem is with your drill:\nMake sure the drill is plugged into a receptacle that has the correct voltage. You might plug a similar tool into the same receptacle to test the power, and if the alternate tool works, you can continue. Inspect the tool and its power cord. Most drills are double insulated, so if you see burnt connectors on the plug, or one is missing, you can assume that this might be causing the problem. Look for damaged insulation or other signs of a problem as well. Smell the drill's motor where the vents are visible. If the internal parts have overheated, there will be a distinct odor of burnt plastic. Hold the trigger in the \"on\" position and tap the drill lightly, making sure the chuck is in a safe position. Loose wires and bad brushes sometimes will allow the drill to run intermittently when you tap the drill."

            "description": "Remove the drill's switch cover so you can test the wires and motor after you have completed the previous steps. If you have already determined the cord is damaged, you can probably skip the testing steps and proceed with repairs. Test the drill's power cord for continuity with an ohmmeter to determine if the conductors are broken. This can be done by connecting the test leads to the prong on each side and the terminal at the drill's switch. If you read continuity on each wire, you can test the switch itself. Squeeze the trigger while contacting the terminals on each side to see if the circuit through the switch is making a connection."
