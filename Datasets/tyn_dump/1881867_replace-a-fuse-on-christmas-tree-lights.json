Be careful not to electrocute yourself. Find the socket that enters the wall. Take a firm hold of the socket and pull it out of the wall. Don\u2019t pull out sockets from the cord. Pulling out light sockets from the cord can cause damage to your lights. Test your lights to verify that they are still not working. Turn on the switch to see if the lights light up."
