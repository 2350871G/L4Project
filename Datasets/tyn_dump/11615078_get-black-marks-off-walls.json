Wring it out so it\u2019s only damp rather than soaked. Start off rubbing lightly and see if the mark starts disappearing. If it doesn\u2019t start coming off right away, then gradually increase the pressure until it does. Then dry the area with a clean, dry cloth. If you have flat paint on your wall, make sure to squeeze the sponge out well. This type of paint isn\u2019t water-resistant, so you could strip the paint if you use a soaked sponge. Make sure the sponge or cloth you use is clean, or you could leave stains on the wall. Scrub in several different directions to hit the stain from multiple sides and remove it completely. If you\u2019re using a kitchen sponge, only use the non-abrasive side. The rough side could damage the paint. If water starts dripping down the wall, then the sponge is too wet and could leave water marks. Wring it out some more and scrub again."

        "Scrub from multiple different directions to work all the mold off.",
        "Start with back and forth, then switch to side to side, and finally to a circular motion.",
        "This method also works on wallpaper, but make sure you wring out the brush well or the wallpaper could bubble up.",
        "If mold is appearing on your wallpaper, there may be more growth underneath it.",
        "You should consider peeling it back around that spot to check.",
