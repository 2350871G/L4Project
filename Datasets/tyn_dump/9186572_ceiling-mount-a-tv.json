Position the brackets so the screw holes align with the mounting slots at the back of the TV. Use the fasteners that came with the wall mount to attach both brackets.

Most ceiling mounts will have different sized fasteners for its various component parts. Use the mount\u2019s instructions to determine which fastener to use. Before tightening the fasteners for the TV brackets, make sure they\u2019re evenly aligned. If uneven, your TV may end up being mounted crooked."
