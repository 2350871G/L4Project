You\u2019ll need at least one or two of these to do a good job, so take into consideration your dog\u2019s breed, hair type, and needs when selecting brushes. For instance, wire-pin brushes work well on curly or wooly coats and on medium to long-haired dogs like retrievers, spaniels, and setters. They may or may not have rubber-tipped ends. Do not use brushes with tips, because these can pull and tear out a healthy coat. You can use bristle brushes on all coat types. However, the longer and coarser your dog\u2019s hair, the more widely spaced and stiff the bristles should be. Slicker brushes have fine bristles made from wire and are especially good at getting rid of tangled hair, as well as touching up the \u201cfurnishings\u201d like the ears and the hair on the hocks.

        "Work against the lay when possible.",
        "Brush the rear-end and tail.",
        "Rear-ends can also be sensitive areas for dogs.",
        "You might do a test-run with the slicker brush to see just how sensitive your pet\u2019s is, before deciding whether to do the rest with a wire-pin brush or comb.",
        "Then, take a long-toothed comb and move to the tail.",
        "A long-haired dog may have lots of tangles and matting here.",
        "Use detangler and a comb for difficult spots.",
        "Remove matting gently.",
        "Many dogs, but especially ones with long and thick double coats, will get mats.",
        "Be patient with any and all of these problem spots.",
        "Above all, make sure not to pull too hard at the hair and hurt the animal.",
        "With a slicker brush, look for mats in the usual spots: behind the ears, in the pants, and under the forelegs.",
        "Hold the fur at the base of mats, and then use a long-toothed comb to try to tease the hair apart.",
        "For larger or difficult mats, apply detangler and work the liquid into the hair with your fingers.",
        "Wait 3-5 minutes before returning with a dematting comb.",
        "Start at the loose end of the mat and, with a sawing motion, move the comb slowly in toward the tangle\u2019s base.",
        "Take a slicker brush once the knot is loosened and make short strokes in the mat, moving toward the dog\u2019s body.",
        "Last, take a long-toothed comb and comb out the whole area to remove any loose hair.",
        "Repeat daily.",
        "Regular grooming will keep your dog healthy and happy.",
        "Brushing removes dirt, fleas, and parasites, spreads out the hair\u2019s natural oils, and keeps the animal\u2019s skin clean.",
        "It will also allow you to note any injuries, bumps, or irregularities on the dog.",
        "Long-haired dogs should be brushed once a day, ideally.",
        "Brushing will remove tangles, promote a healthy coat, and reduce the amount of dander in your home.",
        "Brushing also makes other grooming steps like bathing, trimming around the feet, and clipping toenails easier.",
        "Done regularly and right, brushing should be an enjoyable experience for your dog and a bonding experience for you both.",
        "\u201cRolling\u201d the Undercoat Mist the dog with water.",
        "Many long-haired dog breeds have what it called a \u201cdouble coat.\u201d This means they have a fluffy undercoat for insulation, covered by a coarser outer coat.",
        "\u201cRolling\u201d this undercoat removes dead hairs, spreads out natural oils, and prevents a good deal of  matting.",
        "To get started, mist the dog from head to tail with water from your spray bottle.",
        "As before, the water should get rid of static electricity.",
        "Have dog next lay down on her side.",
        "You will want to do one flank at a time.",
        "Brush the coat back with a wire-pin brush.",
        "Starting at the shoulder, brush back against the lay of the fur.",
        "Hold the dog gently near the head and brush the hair toward her head to create a part.",
        "Continue to back brush small areas of fur \u2013 about 2 inches of coat per stroke \u2013 until you reach the dog\u2019s pants.",
        "Once you have brushed all the fur from the head to the pants, gently brush it back to its normal lay.",
        "Turn dog over.",
        "Now, do the other side.",
        "Turn the dog over, mist, and repeat the procedure.",
        "Brush back with the wire-pin brush, working from the head to the pants, and return the hair to its normal lay when done.",
        "Try to roll the dog\u2019s coat once per week throughout the year.",
        "When done, you should be able to easily run a comb through the length of the coat.",
        "Take a closer look at areas where the comb sticks \u2013 you may find small mats, burs, or insects there."
