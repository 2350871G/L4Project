Spray foam directly into gloved hand and smear a thin layer (1/4\" or so) onto paper. Don't worry about spreading the foam into an even layer. Uneven layers will add texture and shape to your wall. As round bubbles appear, smooth over them with your gloved hand to shape the texture. Add any details now (like crags, shelves, etc) with the foam. Change gloves as needed (you may find that you need to change gloves after each can). Foam will expand for about 30 minutes.
