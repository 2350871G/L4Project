To ensure that the oven is ready to broil the sandwich, move the broiler rack so it\u2019s approximately 8-inches (20-cm) below the heating element. Set the oven to broil and allow it to heat for approximately 5 minutes. Most oven broilers only have two settings: on and off. If yours has more specific heat settings, set the broiler to high. Add olive oil to the bread and broil it until browned. Place 1 loaf of ciabatta bread that\u2019s been cut in half lengthwise on a foil-lined cookie sheet with the cut sides facing up. Drizzle 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of extra virgin olive oil over the pieces of bread, and set them under the broiler until they are crispy and brown, which should take approximately 2 to 3 minutes. You can substitute your favorite type of Italian bread loaf for the ciabatta. It should have a crispy crust, though. Cover the bottom piece of bread with sauce. After you\u2019ve toasted the bread in the broiler, set the top piece aside on a cutting board. Spread approximately 1 cup (257 g) of spaghetti or marinara sauce over the bottom piece of bread so that it\u2019s completely covered.

You can also sprinkle some grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese over the chicken cutlets if you like. Broil the sandwich bottom until the cheese melts.

You may want to serve the sandwiches with some extra sauce for dipping. Pasta salad is a tasty side to serve with the chicken parm sandwiches. Assembling Italian Tomato Hoagies Combine the oils, vinegars, fennel seeds, mustard powder, and dried herbs. Add 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of olive oil, 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of vegetable oil, 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of red wine vinegar, 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of white wine vinegar, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of ground fennel seeds, \u00bd teaspoon (1 g) of English mustard powder, \u00bc teaspoon (\u00be g) of dried basil, and \u00bc teaspoon (\u00bc g) of dried oregano to a small jar with a lid. Place the lid on the jar, and shake well to mix all of the ingredients. The vinaigrette can be made up to a week ahead of game day. Keep it covered, and store it in the refrigerator. Season the vinaigrette with salt and pepper. After you\u2019ve mixed the vinaigrette, remove the lid to taste it. Add kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to season the dressing to your liking. If you\u2019d like your vinaigrette to have some heat, you can also mix in some crushed red pepper to taste. Mix the ricotta and olive oil. Add \u00be cup (188 g) of fresh ricotta and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil to a small bowl. Use a whisk to blend the ingredients together until they are smooth and whipped. Set the mixture aside for a moment. After you mix the ricotta and olive oil together, you can season it with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper for an extra layer of flavor if you like. Combine the lettuce, basil, oregano, and some of the vinaigrette. Add 1 cup (75 g)  of shredded romaine lettuce, 1 cup (25 g) of fresh basil leaves, 2 tablespoons (2 g) of fresh oregano leaves, and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of the vinaigrette to a medium bowl. Toss all of the ingredients together until they\u2019re fully combined. You can substitute iceberg lettuce for the romaine if you prefer. Season the tomatoes with salt and pepper. For the sandwiches, you\u2019ll need 3 to 4 large heirloom tomatoes that have been thinly sliced. Place the tomato slices on a  large plate, and sprinkle them with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. You can substitute beefsteak tomatoes for the heirlooms if you prefer. Spread the ricotta on the bottom half of the rolls. To assemble the sandwiches, you\u2019ll need 4 soft sandwich rolls that have been lightly toasted. Split the rolls open, and use a spatula or butter knife to spread the ricotta mixture over the roll bottoms. Top the ricotta with the greens, tomatoes, pickles, and onions. After you\u2019ve spread the ricotta mixture over the rolls, divide the mixed greens and tomato slices between the four sandwiches and place them over the ricotta. Add bread-and-butter pickles and thinly sliced red onions to each sandwich as well. You add or substitute sun dried tomatoes, roasted red peppers, marinated artichoke hearts, or sliced olives as toppings for the sandwich. If you want to add meat to the sandwiches, consider layering a slice or two of proscuitto, salami, or pepperoni over the tomatoes. Drizzle the sandwiches with the vinaigrette and serve. After you\u2019ve placed all of the fillings on the sandwich, add some of the remaining vinaigrette to each. Place the roll tops on each sandwich, and press gently to close them. Set the sandwiches on a platter to serve. Consider serving the tomato hoagies alongside homemade potato chips. Whipping Up Oven-Baked Pulled-Pork Sandwiches Adjust the rack and preheat the oven. To ready the oven for the pork, move the rack to the lower middle position. Next, set the temperature to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (165 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat. Keep an eye on your oven so you know when it\u2019s reached the proper temperature. Most models will flash an indicator light or beep to alert you.
