Leave the pan uncovered, and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat, which should take 3 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle the breadcrumbs into the pan, and cook until the sauce thickens. After the pan comes to a boil, add \u2154 cup (84 g) of breadcrumbs to the mixture. Allow the mixture to cook for 2 minutes, or until it thickens up. Use plain, unseasoned breadcrumbs for the recipe.
