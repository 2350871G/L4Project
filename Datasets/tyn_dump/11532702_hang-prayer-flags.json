In order for the spiritual messages on the flags to have the greatest success of bringing compassion and goodwill, Buddhists believe they should be hung on auspicious days, some of which are based on the Tibetan calendar. For example, the Tibetan New Year, which fell on February 5th in 2019, is considered an auspicious day.The Tibetan calendar also includes inauspicious dates or days which are not conducive to success. It is recommended that you do not hang prayer flags on inauspicious days. For example, the four elements\u2013earth, water, fire, and wind\u2013influence each day in pairs. January 9th, 2019 was a Fire-Water day, which is considered inauspicious. While the date is important, the Dalai Lama believes that your intentions while hanging prayer flags is much more important than the day on which you hang them."

The 3 Tibetan festivals are: Losar (Tibetan New Year - first day of the lunar calendar), Zam Ling Chi Sang, and Sangpo Chuzom. Put up your prayer flags on a date with an auspicious elemental combination. Use a Tibetan calendar to determine which elemental combination will occur on the dates you want to hang your flags. Check that the day is one of the following combinations, which are auspicious: Earth-Earth, Water-Water, Earth-Water, Fire-Fire, Wind-Wind, and Fire-Wind.Try to avoid hanging your flags on inauspicious days of Earth-Wind, Water-Wind, Earth-Fire, and Fire-Water. Use the auspicious days for your animal sign to hang your prayer flags. If you were born before 2001, keep adding 12 to your birth year until you reach a number between 2001 and 2012.

For example, if you were born in 1980, add 12 to get 1992, then add 12 again to get 2004.

        "Allow a small amount to burn, then blow out the flame to create the smoke.",
        "Move your prayer flags through the smoke to bless them.",
        "Alternatively, move the sang or incense alongside your flags so the smoke touches each one.",
        "Focus on your intentions and motivations while doing this.",
        "Sang is made from juniper or cedar and includes sacred substances such as sugar, molasses, honey, milk, butter, and curd.",

        "Hanging and Disposing of Prayer Flags Handle your prayer flags respectfully and never let them touch the ground.",
        "Whether you\u2019re simply handling your prayer flags, writing messages on them, hanging them, or taking them down and disposing of them, never allow your flags to touch the ground.",
        "Each flag includes sacred texts and spiritual symbols which must be treated with respect.If and when it comes time to dispose of your prayer flags never put them in the garbage.",

        "Hang prayer flags in groups of 5 in the proper order of colours (blue, white, red, green, and yellow).",
        "All prayer flags come in groups of 5 in this order and they should never be separated or rearranged.Each colour represents a specific element: blue is sky or space, white is air or wind, red is fire, green is water, and yellow is earth.",
        "This means you must have your prayer flags in multiples of 5.",
        "You can hang 5 flags, 10 flags, 15 flags, etc., but you can never hang less than 5 flags or 6 flags, 7 flags, etc.",
        "Ensure the day you hang your flags it\u2019s sunny and windy.",

        "Select one or more auspicious day that meets the weather criteria and hang your flags on one of those days.If the forecast is inaccurate and the weather is not sunny and windy, cancel your plans to hang your flags and wait until another auspicious day with the proper weather.",
        "Hang your prayer flags between two structures outside.",
        "Select a location outside where the flags will be able to blow in the breeze.",
        "This location can be between two structures (e.g., trees) or alongside a structure that would allow the wind through (e.g., fence).",
        "Tie together multiple groups of flags with a double knot, if you\u2019re hanging more than one set of flags.",
        "Tie one end of the rope on which the flags are hanging to one structure, then tie the other end to a second structure.For visualization purposes, the flags should look like a clothesline or banner once hung up.",

        "Think about or say your motivations and intentions for the flags while you\u2019re hanging them up.",
        "Allow your prayer flags to fade and disintegrate naturally.",
        "Leave your flags hanging up indefinitely, if you want.",
        "The outside elements (wind, sun, rain, snow) will naturally cause the flags to disintegrate and the spiritual messages to fade.",
        "This fading and disintegration represents the messages being sent to the world and travelling away from the flags.Feel free to hang new prayer flags alongside old prayer flags.",
        "This method represents the continuing cycle of birth (new flags) and death (old flags).",
        "Flags made of cotton will fade faster than flags made of synthetic materials.",
        "Burn or bury your old prayer flags if you have to take them down.",
        "Use a fire to burn any old prayer flags you may have if you had to take your flags down.",
        "If you are unable to have a fire, bury the flags in an out-of-the-way location.",

        "Flags made of synthetic materials, especially polyester, should not be burned, as the smoke produced is toxic.",
        "The smoke from the burning flags is said to carry the blessings from the flags to heaven."
