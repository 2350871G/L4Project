Your doctor will generally want to do an Electrocardiogram (EKG) and an Echocardiogram before resorting the Holter monitor. The EKG and the Echo will give your cardiologist a reading of your heart\u2019s activity in that moment. But your doctor may want a prolonged, more detailed reading. Some common reasons people end up wearing a Holter monitor include suspecting they have an irregular arrhythmia or checking to see if various medication is working effectively."
