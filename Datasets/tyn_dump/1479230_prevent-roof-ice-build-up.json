Climb up to the attic or top room of your house and try to find the source of the leak. Then, plug a box fan into the nearest outlet. It needs to be adjustable so you can position it to point directly at the leak. Note where the leaks are so you can look for them after the weather warms up. Dripping water or water stains make them recognizable. They will often be behind ice dams on the roof. The cold air helps freeze the melting ice back up. It\u2019s a temporary solution, but it gives you some time to regroup until you can call a roofer or get on the roof on a warmer day."

        "Place the stocking so it\u2019s perpendicular with the roof, allowing the salt to melt a trough for water to flow through.",
        "You can create multiple tubes to speed up the drainage process.",
        "Calcium chloride, found at most hardware stores, is often used to prevent ice build up on concrete.",
        "To prevent it from corroding any metal up there, don\u2019t add it directly to the roof.",
        "Another option is to spray the ice with warm water to melt a drainage channel into it.",
        "Don\u2019t do this unless the temperature is above 32 \u00b0F (0 \u00b0C) in your area, or else you will end up with even more ice.",
        "Chip at the ice with a mallet after it has begun to melt.",
        "Use a rubber mallet to limit your chances of damaging the roof.",
        "As the ice around the edges of the eaves begin to melt, climb up on a ladder and start hammering.",
        "Widen any drainage channels you see in order to draw moisture off the roof at a faster rate.",
        "This works best on warmer days when the ice begins to soften.",
        "Make a channel in the ice first by using an ice melter or warm water.",
        "Once the ice softens, it\u2019s much easier to chip away.",
        "Never use sharp tools like ice picks or hatchets on the ice, since you will most likely puncture the shingles underneath it.",
        "Be very careful when working to avoid hitting the roof.",
        "Removing the ice this way can be very dangerous if you\u2019re not careful.",
        "You could trigger the entire sheet of ice.",
        "To prevent it from falling, work on a warm day and chisel away at the edges of a melted channel.",
        "Hire a professional to remove the ice dams in an emergency.",
        "Professionals follow a lot of the same steps you would take to remove an ice dam on your own, but they have better tools.",
        "They scrape off the excess snow and then they melt a channel in the ice with steam.",
        "They then chip away at the remaining ice.",
        "It\u2019s a little pricey, but you don\u2019t have to worry about your roof sustaining damage.",
        "A basic treatment from a professional costs between $200 to $300 USD on average.",
        "If you\u2019re too late to stop the ice from forming and notice leaks in the roof, it may be worth the cost.",
        "Fixing Roof Leaks Check for leaks underneath roof shingles and insulation.",
        "Start by climbing into the top room of your home and pulling away the insulation.",
        "Look for those telltale water marks as well as any spots that feel cold or wet to the touch.",
        "When the weather gets warmer, head up onto the roof and check for gaps in the roofing and waterproofing.",
        "Keep in mind that warm air leaking up through an attic floor can also contribute to ice build up.",
        "Track water stains higher up along the roof if you\u2019re uncertain of where a stain originates.",
        "Expect moisture to run downhill along the slope of the roof.",
        "Another way to find damaged spots is to shine a light up through the roof.",
        "Look for the light to shine through small holes in the insulation.",
        "The insulation around these spots may also turn black over time.",
        "Repair leaks by covering them with foam or caulk.",
        "Clear away any debris around the damaged portion, then fill it in with something waterproof.",
        "Use a caulking gun to spread a sealant or an expanding foam.",
        "If your roof is in bad shape, you may need to cut away and replace the damaged portion.",
        "It could lead to big heat leaks that cause even more water and ice damage.",
        "The repairs you need to make depend on the type of roof you have.",
        "Replace old shingles to repair a shingle roof.",
        "Patch over the membrane with roofing cement if your roof is made out of a substrate.",
        "Install waterproof flashings if your chimney is leaking.",
        "Chimneys are common sources of water leaks, meaning that escaping heat could be melting snow there.",
        "To fix this, you will need to purchase L-shaped steel flashings that fit snugly against the chimney and the roof.",
        "Remove the old flashings if you have had any installed in the past.",
        "Spread a fire-resistant sealant to hold the new ones in place, then nail them to the roof.",
        "Installing flashing is somewhat difficult if you\u2019re unfamiliar with how to do it.",
        "You need to measure the angle formed by the roof and chimney, then cut or order metal pieces that fit.",
        "Consider hiring a professional installer to keep your roof safe.",
        "The installation process can be dangerous.",
        "While on top of your home, wear a safety harness anchored to the roof.",
        "Seal and insulate leaking roof ducts with caulk.",
        "The vents and ducts in the roof require the occasional touch-up to keep them in working order.",
        "Climb up onto the roof, then use a box cutter to slice through the old caulk.",
        "Scrape away the debris, then spread a bead of caulk around the duct or vent to seal it in place.",
        "If your vent is leaky, it probably is also leaking hot air.",
        "That hot air melts the ice, causing an ice dam further down.",
        "Clip a snow melting system to your roof to resist ice formation.",
        "Snow melting systems take the form of heated wires that clip to shingles and the edge of your roof.",
        "Run the heating elements back and forth in a zigzag above the gutters.",
        "Then, plug the system into a nearby outlet to melt away the snow.",
        "You will need to run the wire through downspouts attached to the roof so the water doesn\u2019t freeze as it runs off the roof.",
        "Wait for a clear, dry day to install the wires.",
        "Don\u2019t risk going up on the roof while it\u2019s slippery.",
        "Wear a harness to guard against falls.",
        "Place an ice and moisture barrier under shingles to waterproof them.",
        "The barrier is a membrane that limits ice and water leakage.",
        "It is basically a sticker that you press onto the roof after you peel off the backing.",
        "Once the barrier is in place, lay new shingles down on top of it.",
        "Although this is an effective solution, it is also pretty expensive.",
        "It\u2019s worth the cost if you\u2019re redoing the entire roof.",
        "When you need to repair individual tiles, try sliding a barrier in place before adding new shingles.",
        "Venting and Insulating Your Home Hire a professional to evaluate your roof for damage and sustainability.",
        "Look for affordable roofing contractors in your area.",
        "Make sure they have plenty of experience weatherizing roofs.",
        "When you call, ask them to take a look at your roof and check that the insulation is secure.",
        "A contractor with weatherizing expertise can show you where you need to pad the insulation to bring it up to code.",
        "Some good contractors may be listed as energy management or insulation contractors.",
        "That usually means that they specialize in dealing with heat flow issues that cause ice dams.",
        "Also, see if your roof is capable of handling the snow load that may build up after you insulate and waterproof your roof.",
        "Architects can often help with this.",
        "Cover attic hatches and fans with weatherstripped caps.",
        "Think of a cap as a foam box that fits over the attic opening in the ceiling or any big fans you have up there.",
        "Caps are made of foam boards with foil on one side.",
        "If you\u2019re making your own, position the boards so the foil is on the inside of the finished cap.",
        "Then, use aluminum tape to bind the boards to one another.",
        "You can buy pre-made caps at a hardware store, although they aren\u2019t too hard to make by buying the individual parts.",
        "If you\u2019re looking for something more professional, consider adding a plywood inner layer.",
        "Glue the foam boards to the wood with caulk.",
        "Add thicker insulation to prevent the roof from getting warm.",
        "Attics need a layer of insulation between 12 to 14 in (30 to 36 cm) thick.",
        "Pull back the insulation and measure it.",
        "If it\u2019s too thin, purchase fiberglass or cellulose, then pack it between the rafters in your attic.",
        "Use a blowing machine, which is often free to rent when you purchase insulation from a hardware store.",
        "Insulation is irritating, so protect yourself by covering up.",
        "In addition to a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, and work gloves, wear eye goggles and a dust mask.",
        "Add a ridge vent strip to the roof\u2019s peak if you don\u2019t already have one.",
        "Ventilation holes direct warm air out so that the roof stays at a consistent temperature.",
        "A ridge vent runs across the entire length of the roof.",
        "It is then covered with a vent strip nailed in place and covered with new shingles.",
        "While you can get all the supplies you need from a hardware store, it\u2019s usually better to let a professional roof installer do the work.",
        "Keep in mind that many roofs are difficult to vent.",
        "If your roof is flat or has skylights, for instance, you may need to find another strategy.",
        "Make vents along the roof\u2019s eaves to let out hot air.",
        "Soffit vents fit underneath the hanging edges of a roof.",
        "To install a soffit vent, cut away part of the wood underneath the horizontal edge of the roof.",
        "Then, fit an 8 in \u00d7 16 in (20 cm \u00d7 41 cm) metal ventilation plate over the hole and screw it in place.",
        "Add more vents as needed to improve the air flow inside your home.",
        "You need approximately 1 sq ft (0.093 m) of vent space for every 300 sq ft (28 m) of floor space in your attic.",
        "If you\u2019re unwilling to risk installing vents yourself, contact a roofing professional.",
        "Route exhaust ducts and vents outdoors instead of through the attic.",
        "Heating ducts in the attic increase the chances of ice forming on the roof.",
        "Follow these ducts from the appliances in your home to see where they go.",
        "For the best result, they need to pass directly through the roof or walls to transport hot air outdoors.",
        "If they don\u2019t, try to reroute them through an external vent.",
        "Check the ducts leading from kitchens, bathrooms, and laundry equipment.",
        "These sources can dump a lot of hot air in the attic if the ducts aren\u2019t routed correctly.",
        "Consider calling a heating and cooling technician to help you solve duct issues."
