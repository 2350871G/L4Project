Locate the screws or bolts holding the top cover on the chainsaw's body and use either a screwdriver or wrench to loosen them. Look for a black wire plugging into a circular port under the cover, and pull the wire out of the port to disconnect power from the spark plug. Don't measure the bar length while the spark plug wire is still attached to prevent the saw from starting while you're working on it.
