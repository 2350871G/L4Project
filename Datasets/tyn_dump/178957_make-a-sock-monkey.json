Again, note that the heel is actually hidden beneath the sock at this point, so you may have to flip it over briefly to double-check your positioning. Erasable fabric marker works best for drawing. Make sure before you cut that your line is indeed on the halfway mark -- a monkey with one fat leg and one skinny leg is not a happy monkey.

You can either use a sewing machine or sew by hand. If you're using a sewing machine, use your walking foot. Cut along the line between your two seams. The monkey\u2019s legs and colored feet will now be clearly visible. Making the Body and Head Turn the sock right-side out and stuff the entire thing. Polyfill stuffing is available at all craft supply stores. The upper half of the sock will become the torso and head. The amount of stuffing is up to you. How firm do you want your monkey? If the sock is thin, you may want to err on the side of under stuffing, as overstuffing it may cause it to stretch. Sew the head and/or hat.

Attach the arms to either side of the body. You may want them a little higher than your natural inclination says; this will give your sock a more monkey-like posture. Assembling the Face and Ears Trim away the edges of the heel piece if necessary. Since this will form the muzzle, try to make sure the piece of fabric is uniform in color.
