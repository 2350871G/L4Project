There are large desktop scanners, smaller handheld varieties, and models that can be installed in your vehicle and operated while you're driving. Before you shell out hundreds of dollars on the first model you see, take a moment to consider which type will work best for your intended purposes. Ask yourself how you'll be using your scanner. Do you plan on doing most of your listening from the privacy of your home, or would you rather keep up with the action while you're out on the go? Standalone police scanners can range in price from hundreds to thousands of dollars.
