The drawback is that suckers will develop from the stem that you leave behind, which will require additional pruning. This technique is better when you're dealing with large suckers; if the wound becomes diseased, it will be further away from the main stem. This method also leaves a few inches on the sucker to reduce the shock to the plant. Prune suckers all summer long to keep the plant healthy.
