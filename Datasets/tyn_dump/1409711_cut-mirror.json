Avoid cutting mirrors that are already severely chipped or cracked in multiple places. A mirror in bad condition may not be able to withstand the cutting process and shatter while you\u2019re working with it. If you\u2019re looking for another source to buy uncut mirror, look for specialty shops that deal specifically in mirror and glass. It may be helpful to purchase a few pieces of inexpensive mirror to practice on. Try single-strength window glass, since it is easier to cut and usually the least expensive."

Place them so the bottom jaw touches the score on your mirror. The top jaw should touch the mirror about 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) on either side of the score line. Squeeze the pliers, which will cause them to separate, and the pressure will widen the score line. This widening will cause the score to crack along the rest of your line in a very controlled breaking pattern. If you\u2019re breaking a long score line, you might want to apply the pliers gently at one end, until you hear a very faint clicking sound.

        "This will cleanly complete the break at the edges.",
        "Use running pliers and a springy surface to break curved score lines.",
        "For scores that have multiple curves, turn the mirror upside down on a springy surface, such as a piece of foam or cardboard.",
        "If the curve isn't very dramatic, press down on the score line with your thumb, which will cause the break.",
        "However, running pliers are the best to use on curves and semi-circles.",
        "If you're cutting mirror with lots of curves, invest in running pliers and the breaking process will go much more smoothly.",
        "Sand and seal the edges of your newly cut mirror (optional).",
        "If you\u2019re placing your mirror in a frame so that the raw edges won\u2019t be visible, this is probably unnecessary (although you can still do it if you like).",
        "Sand down the edges with sandpaper, then apply mirror edge sealant or some other hermetic coating to the edges.",
        "You can find these materials at any hardware store.",
        "You can also use clear fingernail polish and get similar results."
