        "If necessary, plop your bottles back into the solution while scrubbing them to remove any clinging scraps of paper.",
        "Use baking soda and dish soap to dissolve labels that put up a fight.",
        "Combine equal parts baking soda and liquid dish soap in a small dish and mix the two ingredients until they form a thick paste.",
        "Smear the paste onto the outside of the bottle using a cloth or sponge and let it sit for about 5 minutes before wiping it off.",
        "The rest of the label should vanish with it.",
        "Flip your sponge over and use the abrasive side if you need to increase your scrubbing power.",
        "You can use this solution to deal with troublesome adhesive residue after the fact or apply the paste directly to the label itself.",
        "Dissolving Stubborn Adhesive with Oil Remove as much of the label as possible by hand.",
        "Start by scraping up a corner of the label with your fingernail and using the flap to peel off the bulk of the label.",
        "Don\u2019t worry if your handiwork isn\u2019t very clean\u2014that\u2019s what the oil is for.",
        "If you\u2019re having trouble getting the label started, soak the bottle in warm water for 10-15 minutes before giving it another shot.",
        "This method works best as a secondary measure to get rid of leftover label adhesive, but you could also use it on a label that\u2019s still in place.",
        "Crack open a container of cooking oil.",
        "Olive or vegetable oil are two of the most frequently-recommended oils for label removal, but you could also use canola, peanut, sunflower, avocado, or any other liquid oil.",
        "Whatever you\u2019ve got lying around in your cupboard should get the job done.",
        "Oils essentially work by weakening the adhesive\u2019s grip on the smooth plastic.",
        "You\u2019re not guaranteed to have the same luck with semi-solid oils like coconut oil or vegetable shortening, but they might be worth a try if you don\u2019t have anything else on hand.Tip: In a pinch, a commercial lubricant or solvent like WD-40 or Goo Gone can also do the trick.",
        "Spread the oil onto the remaining residue and let it sit for 5 minutes.",
        "Drizzle a little oil onto a folded paper towel and rub it directly onto the outside of the bottle, focusing on spots where the adhesive is still heaviest.",
        "Once you\u2019ve done that, set the bottle down and let the oil begin working its magic.",
        "A cotton swab or soft sponge could also serve as a useful applicator.",
        "Make sure you wear gloves to protect your hands if you\u2019re working with WD-40 or a similar lubricant or solvent.",
        "Products like these can cause minor irritation when brought into contact with exposed skin.",
        "Wipe off the loosened residue.",
        "To do this, you can either use the same paper towel you used to apply the oil or grab a wet cloth or sponge.",
        "In most cases, a quick rinse with warm water will also be enough to flush away the liquefied adhesive.",
        "You can now use your bottle for any number of other projects or purposes.",
        "If the outside of the bottle feels slick afterwards, wash it with warm water and a few drops of liquid dish soap to lift away the excess oil.",
        "Freezing off Labels Place the empty bottle in your freezer.",
        "That\u2019s it.",
        "Stick it in the freezer and get back to your busy life.",
        "This solution is perfect for when you want to put your empty prescription bottles to other uses but don\u2019t have time to clean them up manually.",
        "If possible, situate your bottle or bottles in the coldest section of the freezer.",
        "In most freezers, this will be on the top shelf, or in the back near the air vents.",
        "Freezing is perhaps the most hands-off way to remove stuck-on prescription labels, but not everyone may get the same results.Warning: In order for this method to work, it\u2019s important that the temperature of the surrounding environment be as low as possible.",
        "A refrigerator just won\u2019t have the same effect.",
        "Leave the bottle in the freezer for 3-5 hours.",
        "No need to bother with a timer.",
        "Just let the bottle sit for a few hours and come back and check on it later.",
        "In the meantime, avoid opening the freezer anymore than necessary to ensure that the temperature inside stays constant.",
        "The idea is that the cold air circulating through the freezer will make the tacky adhesive brittle, eventually breaking its grip on the plastic and causing it to fall right off.",
        "Peel off the chilled label in one piece.",
        "In all likelihood, you\u2019ll open your freezer to find the label lying at the base of the bottle.",
        "If that\u2019s not the case, just pry up one corner and marvel at how effortlessly the rest comes loose.",
        "It\u2019s that simple!",
        "On the off chance that the label is still sticky, you can always give it a brief soak in warm, soapy water, zap it with a hair dryer, or wipe it down with cooking oil to finish what you started."
