Baby goats need a space that is both warm and dry, as either cold or dampness can have an ill effect on their health. Make sure there is plenty of warm bedding, such as pine chips , wheat straw and hay can be used for warm bedding . Change any bedding that becomes wet. If the area is cold, consider adding a heat lamp. Make sure the heat lamp is absolutely secure, as it is a fire hazard. Keep the lamp at least 3 ft (0.91 m) above the kids, and make sure they can go to a cooler area if they get too warm."

However, freshly broken navel cords can become infected and may need additional attention. Never cut the cord between the mother and newborn. Allow this to break naturally. Only attempt trimming the cord if it is longer than four inches after it breaks. If you are unsure of what to do, make sure your veterinarian is on site during the birthing process. If the cord is still quite long, you should trim it closer to the kids stomach. Trim to about three to four inches in length. Always used sterilized instruments. Make sure whatever instrument, such as a pair of scissors, are sharp enough to make the cut. Dip the cord in iodine, betadine, or diluted chlorhexidine. This kills bacteria and prevents infection. It also helps the cord dry much faster. The cord should fall away from the newborn within three weeks."

If bottle feeding, you can get milk from the mother, another goat producing milk, or purchase it from a farm supply store. Dramatic changes in their lifestyle or diet can affect their mood and the solidness of their stool.

Help it to get to this stage by slowly introducing solid foods, such as hay or pasture feed, while reducing the amount of milk being offered. Offer hay, grain, time in the pasture, and fresh water to allow your baby goat to start eating these foods instead of milk. Most healthy goats can start to be weaned at about thirty days old. A goat can start to be weaned at about twenty-five to thirty pounds or double its birth weight. You may start to offer grain at about one week of age to help the goat start rumen development."

If you are unsure of how to dis-bud your baby goats, please contact a veterinarian. Improper removal of horn buds can cause serious harm. Remove horn buds at around one week old. Removing horns only becomes more difficult with an older goat. Usually, a disbudding iron will be used to dis-bud your baby goat.
