You must purchase dust that is specifically for chinchilla dust baths. Do not use bath sands, as the grains are too coarse. A finely ground pumice is the best option. The dust you use should resemble volcanic ash, which is very fine and light. You can also buy lightly scented chinchilla dust, if you want a little something special."

Fish bowls and plastic house-like containers are suitable choices for your chinchilla. The proper bathhouse will ensure that your chinchilla can comfortably and happily keep its coat shiny and clean. The right choice will also eliminate the majority of dust particles from exiting the house and ending up in the cage or surrounding areas. Buying a clear bathhouse will allow you to watch the entertaining wonder of a chinchilla taking this unique type of bath. Plastic houses will get scratched up overtime. If you plan on buying a clear house so that you can watch your chinchilla take its dust bath, a thick and sturdy glass house is a better option."
