Warm \u00bd cup (120 milliliters) of vinegar in the microwave for 30 seconds, use it to dampen a sponge or clean rag, and scrub it over the scum. Let soak for 5 minutes, then rinse off with warm water. The vinegar may leave an unpleasant smell, but this should wash away after a shower or 2 after it dries. If your bathroom has poor ventilation, dilute the vinegar with equal parts water to prevent irritation of your eyes and sinuses. The soft side of the sponge is usually sufficient. The abrasive side is more effective, but can scratch some types of glass, especially if used repeatedly."
