    "text": " Basic Lasagna with Meat Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (176 degrees Celsius). In a large skillet, add the ground beef and sausage and cook on medium heat until lightly browned. Drain most of the fat from the pan, leaving some behind for flavor. Stir in four cups of the spaghetti sauce. In a large bowl, beat the eggs and then add the ricotta cheese, 1 1/2 cups of mozzarella cheese, garlic powder, parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix all of the ingredients together. Set the remaining mozzarella cheese aside for later. Add one cup of the meat sauce to the bottom of a baking dish. Spread the mixture out evenly to form a smooth layer. Cover the meat sauce with one layer of uncooked noodles (about 3). Spread half of the cheese mixture over the noodles. Make sure to form an even layer that covers the entire dish. Repeat the process with another layer of meat sauce, noodles, and cheese. Then add an additional layer of noodles and top it with the remaining meat sauce. Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella and parmesan cheese over the meat sauce. Cover with aluminum foil and bake in the oven for 45 minutes. Remove the dish from the oven and take off the foil. Bake uncovered for an additional 15 minutes, or until the noodles are tender. Let the lasagna stand for 15 minutes before serving. Italian Lasagna with Creamy Bechamel Sauce Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius).  Prepare the Bechamel sauce. In a large pot, melt the butter completely over medium heat. Add in the flour and whisk until smooth. Gradually add in the milk, continuing to whisk and simmer over medium heat for about 10 minutes. The sauce should be thick, smooth, and creamy when finished. Set aside and allow to cool completely. Heat extra-virgin olive oil in a saut\u00e9 pan and then add the ground beef. Season with salt and pepper and cook the meat until it is browned. Drain the excess fat and set aside, allowing to cool completely. In a medium-sized bowl, whisk the eggs. Add in the ricotta cheese, salt, and pepper and then mix thoroughly. Spread an even layer of the Bechamel sauce (about 1/3 of it) into the bottom of a baking dish. Cover it with one layer of pasta, overlapping the pasta slightly to make sure the entire dish is covered. Cover with one layer of the ricotta mixture. Follow with one layer of spinach, and then add another layer of pasta sheets. Add all of the ground beef in an even layer. Cover it with 1 1/2 cups of mozzarella cheese. Spread another 1/3 of the Bechamel sauce over the mozzarella. Arrange another layer of pasta on top, and then spread the remaining bechamel sauce over it. Sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Cover the lasagna with aluminum foil and bake for about 30 minutes. Remove the cover and bake for an additional 15 minutes. Allow to cool before serving. Enjoy with a glass of red wine if you are old enough.",
