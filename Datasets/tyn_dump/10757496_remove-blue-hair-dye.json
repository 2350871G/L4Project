Mix the crushed Vitamin C tablets with 3 to 4 tablespoons (44 to 59 mL) of shampoo. Apply the paste to damp hair, put on a shower cap, and let the paste sit for 2 hours. Afterwards, rinse out the paste and then use some conditioner to moisturize your hair. The citric acid in the Vitamin C tablets breaks down the dye in your hair, which makes it come out easier when you wash it. This method works best on semi-permanent dyes, but it can also help to lighten permanent dyes, too. Repeat this process as many times as you want to get the color you\u2019d like. One treatment should lighten your blue hair by one shade, so depending on how dark your hair is, you may need to do 3 or 4 treatments."

After you\u2019ve washed your hair, apply the baking soda paste to your entire head, and let it sit for 10 minutes. Rinse out the paste with warm water and then condition your hair like you normally would. The dandruff shampoo and baking soda combo works well because the shampoo contains clarifying properties, which strip away color, and the baking soda is great at removing stains, which is essentially what has happened to your hair. This is a great way to speed up the fading process for blue hair dye. Use this method each time you wash your hair to quickly fade your locks over the course of several weeks."
