The right oil will soak into the wood's pores, keeping the wood strong and slowing absorption of water that can cause rot. A couple coats of oil can protect wood for years, but this depends greatly on the oil and environment, so check regularly. If a dab of oil is rapidly absorbed, the wood has dried out. Even if you plan on painting the wood, you may want to oil it first, especially if the wood is old and in poor condition. Teak is a uniquely long-lived wood which does not need to be oiled, although once it has been oiled it may require regular reapplication."

Follow this advice to select the best one for your wood:\nTung oil gives good protection, if you can accept the high price and hours of drying time. A finish that contains tung oil gives better water protection than 100% tung oil, but avoid varnishes that create a top layer instead of soaking in, and be wary of products sold as \"tung oil\" that have no relation to the real product. For cutting boards and other kitchen applications, use food-safe mineral oil, or coconut, walnut, or almond oil. Avoid the last two if nut allergies are an issue. Mix in \u00bd teaspoon (2.5 mL) melted beeswax for each cup (240 mL) oil for additional protection. There are many synthetic products out there, including pretty good ones that use linseed oil as a base but provide additional protection. Modern water-based finishes are cheap and easy to apply, but not good for long-term preservation. Boiled linseed oil (\"BLO\") is a common choice, but provides poor water resistance and yellows over time. Its main advantage is price.
