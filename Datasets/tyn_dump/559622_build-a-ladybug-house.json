Instead of making round holes, try cutting thin slats into the house. Slats are big enough for ladybugs but too small for bees and butterflies.

Use decorations such as stickers to make the house unique and stand out. For example, use bright stickers in the shape of flowers to attract more ladybugs, or use round, black stickers for a house with ladybug spots.

Soaking a cotton ball or paper towel in clean water is a safe way to keep the house supplied. Replace it once it begins to dry out. Alternatively, make your own pool. For example, shape tin foil or cut up a Styrofoam plate into a shallow pool about 5 in (13 cm) wide. Keep pools very shallow in case the ladybugs fall into it. Even small amount of water can be dangerous for them. For that reason, using bottle caps isn\u2019t recommended. If you have bamboo or other plants in them, lightly spray the house with a misting bottle. That way, the ladybugs have plenty of water without needing a pool."

        "If you leave the house open, for example, the holes are unnecessary.",
        "Paint and decorate the outside of the house if you desire.",
        "Get a can of water-resistant latex paint in your favorite color, then use a big brush to color the house.",
        "Ladybugs respond to bright colors like white, yellow, and light blue.",
        "To make your house stand out, also consider painting it red and black for some ladybug fashion.",
        "Use decorations such as stickers to make the house unique and stand out.",
        "For example, use bright stickers in the shape of flowers to attract more ladybugs, or use round, black stickers for a house with ladybug spots.",
        "Work in a ventilated area and wear a safety mask while painting, especially if you choose to use spray paint instead of canned paint.",
        "Priming a new house isn\u2019t necessary for fresh wood, especially if you sanded it first.",
        "If you ever need to repaint the house, plan on priming it first to hide the old layer of paint.",
        "Filling the Inside Part of the House Place a stick or wood block in the house to create compartments.",
        "Cut a piece of scrap wood about 5 \u20442 in (14 cm) long and 1 in (2.5 cm) tall, for instance, and fit it inside the house.",
        "Most ladybugs congregate together, but some like to crawl off on their own.",
        "The wood creates a divider that gives the ladybugs more surfaces to crawl around on.",
        "Make sure the scrap block or stick you choose fits inside the house, dividing the space up into separate little \u201crooms\u201d for shy ladybugs.",
        "Bamboo sticks are a great way to give ladybugs lot of hiding spots.",
        "Order some bamboo online, then cut the sticks into segments that fit inside the house.",
        "Position the sticks so the cut end faces the house\u2019s entrance.",
        "Place raisins and other sweet foods inside the house.",
        "Although ladybugs mostly live on pests, they enjoy sugar from time to time.",
        "Set a couple of raisins or an apple slice in your ladybug house for the new guests.",
        "To make the raisins bigger and last longer, soak them in water for 5 minutes, dry them gently with a paper towel, then cut them in half.",
        "Ladybugs also love sugar water.",
        "Stir some sugar into a bowl of water, about 1 part sugar to 10 parts water.",
        "Then, soak the water up with a sponge.",
        "Move the sponge into the house for the ladybugs.",
        "Add a water source like a cotton ball dampened in fresh water.",
        "Ladybugs, especially younger ones, need a little bit of clean water to survive.",
        "Soaking a cotton ball or paper towel in clean water is a safe way to keep the house supplied.",
        "Replace it once it begins to dry out.",
        "Alternatively, make your own pool.",
        "For example, shape tin foil or cut up a Styrofoam plate into a shallow pool about 5 in (13 cm) wide.",
        "Keep pools very shallow in case the ladybugs fall into it.",
        "Even small amount of water can be dangerous for them.",
        "For that reason, using bottle caps isn\u2019t recommended.",
        "If you have bamboo or other plants in them, lightly spray the house with a misting bottle.",
        "That way, the ladybugs have plenty of water without needing a pool.",
        "Hanging and Maintaining the House Set the house in a secure spot out of the rain.",
        "Find a spot to set the house, such as on a sturdy tree branch.",
        "Choose a covered spot with plenty of leaves, a roof, or other protections that will keep water from entering the house.",
        "Make sure the house won\u2019t get blown over by the wind.",
        "The best spot for the house is up in the air, on a branch, wall, or a similar surface.",
        "That way, bugs on the ground have a harder time reaching it.",
        "To secure the house, hang it on a branch or a pole with a hook.",
        "Tie it in place with a strong wire.",
        "Drill small holes as needed to thread a hanging wire through the house.",
        "Place ladybug houses near gardens to get more visitors.",
        "Ladybugs eat pests like aphids and mites, which live on garden plants.",
        "If you keep your house as close to a garden as possible, you have a better chance of attracting ladybugs to it.",
        "They may stop by as they fly to and from the garden.",
        "Rose bushes are popular with aphids.",
        "They also like vegetable plants, such as lettuce and broccoli.",
        "Keep the ladybug house near these plants to increase the chances of attracting visitors.",
        "Ladybugs also eat pollen from some flowers and herbs.",
        "Hang the ladybug house as a shelter near dill, cilantro, geraniums, cosmos, and other garden plants.",
        "Replace the food and water sources every week.",
        "Check the house often to make sure the ladybugs are happy and healthy.",
        "When the old food starts to spoil, swap it out for something fresh.",
        "Also, refill the water source or mist the house when it dries out so the ladybugs don\u2019t leave.",
        "For example, replace raisins when they start smelling sour or become moldy.",
        "Apple slices will turn soft and brown as they spoil."
