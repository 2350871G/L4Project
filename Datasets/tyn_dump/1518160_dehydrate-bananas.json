This raised wire platform exposes every side of the banana to the air and allows excess moisture to drip through. Also ready a cookie sheet or baking pan to place beneath it. The bananas should be in a single layer, not stacked atop each other. It's fine if their edges are touching.

Use the center rack of the oven and be careful not to drop any slices onto the oven floor. If using a wire rack, place the baking sheet in the oven first to catch drips, then place the rack on top of the baking sheet. Let them bake according to shape and desired crispiness. For chips, this will take 1 to 3 hours. Wedges will take 6 to 12 hours. The longer you bake them, the crispier they will be. Flip the bananas over once about halfway through the baking process. This will dry each side evenly and is especially important if the bananas are placed directly on a baking sheet.

The early preparation is similar to the oven method, but pay attention to the sizes. Peel the bananas and slice them in 1/4 inch rounds (0.6 cm) to produce leathery chews, or slice them 1/16 to 1/8 inches thick (0.15 to 0.3 cm) to make crunchy chips.

Spray or rub a little oil on the rack of your dehydrator. This step isn't mandatory but will prevent the banana slices from sticking. You could even rub oil directly onto the bananas to be extra cautious. Place the slices on the dehydrator's drying rack. None of the slices should overlap. It's fine if they touch slightly; they should shrink a little as they dry. Set the temperature to 135\u00ba F (57\u00baC). Making leathery chews will take anywhere from 6 to 12 hours. Crisp chips will take longer, up to a full 24 hour day. If your model of dehydrator comes with specific instructions for bananas, use the temperature and time listed there instead. Check their progress every 2-4 hours and rotate the tray to ensure even drying. If you decided not to put lemon juice on them, the caramel brown color is a good sign that they're done or nearly done. Otherwise, you can take a sample out to taste test once it's cooled to room temperature. If you leave your chews in too long and dislike the extra-tough texture, continue to dehydrate them and turn them into crisps. This may not work if the slices are extra thick. Cool the bananas to room temperature before eating. If you store them in an airtight container, they should stay good for months. Fruit Leather in a Dehydrator Peel the bananas. You can keep them whole or slice them in half lengthwise. Place the whole bananas between two sheets of parchment paper. The bananas should be at least 3 inches apart from one another. Use a heavy cutting board to smash the bananas. Try to apply even pressure to keep the banana mash an even consistency. You can also use a rolling pin for this. The goal is to get the bananas down to about 1/8 of an inch (0.3 cm). If you don't want to measure them, just make it as flat as you can! Transfer the parchment paper to the dehydrator rack. Peel off the top sheet before you begin dehydrating. Set your dehydrator to 135\u00baF (57\u00baC) for 7 hours. Check in at the 4 and 6-hour mark to see how they're doing. When ready, the top should be leathery but not sticky. If the bottom is still moist, you can optionally flip them over halfway through. Let cool and slice into strips. These can be rolled up and stored in an airtight container for several months. Microwave Crisps Peel and slice the bananas. Aim for 1/4 inch rounds (0.6 cm) or slightly smaller. Larger slices won't cook as well, while smaller ones burn more easily. Oil a microwave-safe plate. Use a generous amount of pleasantly flavored oil such as olive or coconut oil. Place the banana slices on the plate with space between each one. Microwave on high for one minute. The bananas should start turning soft and releasing moisture. Turn each slice over. You can also add additional flavor at this point. A sprinkling of sea salt or kosher salt adds a great savory flavor, while grated nutmeg or ground cinnamon works well with the bananas' sweetness. Continue microwaving for 30 seconds at a time. This might take a couple of minutes depending on your microwave. Serve immediately. Unlike other drying methods, these will only stay fresh for about a day. Sun-Drying Chips Check your area's weather forecast. To successfully sun dry fruit, you'll need at least 2 days of hot, dry weather and a clear sky (at least 90\u00ba F/32\u00baC with low humidity). Ideally, you should allow for a full 7 days of drying, especially if the temperature is below 100\u00baF/38\u00baC. Make or purchase an outdoor drying screen. All you need is a rectangular wooden frame with a food-safe mesh stretched across it. Stainless steel or plastic are the best options for meshes. Do NOT use aluminum, hardware cloth, or fiberglass meshes (unless the fiberglass mesh is clearly labeled food-grade). Prepare the bananas. Since you're using a much lower temperature than other methods, you may wish to slice them extra thin. Peel the bananas and slice them into 1/8 inch rounds (0.3 cm), or at least no larger than 1/4 inch (0.6 cm). If you want to prevent browning, dip the pieces in lemon juice. Add additional flavor if desired. Powdered cinnamon adds a strong flavor for sweet snacking. Place the chips on the mesh of the drying frame. Keep them in a single layer with no overlaps. It's fine if their edges touch; they should shrink a little as they dry. Cover the chips with an insect-proof netting or cheesecloth. This will help keep dust off your food as well. Place the drying frame in direct sunlight away from sources of car exhaust and out of reach of animals. Elevate it at least a few inches off the ground (for instance by placing it atop stacked cinder blocks). Your roof is a great high-sun option that keeps it removed from most environmental pollution. A concrete driveway will reflect the heat from the ground, drying the bananas faster. Bring the drying frame indoors at night. Even if the nights are still relatively warm, dew will add additional moisture to the bananas. Put it outside again during the day. Flip the bananas over once about halfway through the drying process. The timing doesn't need to be precise; anytime on the second day of drying is fine. Continue to dry for up to 7 days. Check daily to see if they're ready to eat. If you're not sure, just cut one open or bite into it to check for moisture. Store the bananas in an airtight container. If completely dried, they should stay good for months. Finished. ",

        " Chips or Wedges in an Oven Preheat your oven to the lowest temperature setting.",
        "This is usually between 125\u00ba\u2014200\u00baF (50\u00ba\u201490\u00baC).",
        "A higher temperature risks scorching the outside and not drying the inside.",
        "Peel and slice the bananas.",
        "To make chips, slice the bananas into 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) rounds.",
        "To make wedges, cut the banana lengthwise, then lengthwise again, and slice into desired length.",
        "NOTE: Wedges can take up to 12 hours to dry!",
        "Start preparing them in the morning so you don't risk starting a fire overnight.",
        "Chips dry much more quickly.",
        "For extra crispy chips, slice the bananas into 1/8 inch rounds instead (0.3 cm).",
        "This may be easier with a mandoline.",
        "If the bananas are mushy and difficult to slice, chill them in the fridge for 5-10 minutes to firm them up.",
        "You don't even need a knife to make wedges!",
        "Work your finger into the end of the peeled banana and it should divide into three segments.",
        "It doesn't matter if the banana breaks in the process.",
        "You'll want it in smaller lengths anyway.",
        "For a large quantity of bananas, soaking them in lemon juice for several minutes before slicing will save you preparation time, but the additional moisture will add time to the baking stage.",
        "Dip the pieces in lemon juice.",
        "This will add flavor and vitamins, but the main purpose is to prevent the bananas from turning brown.",
        "If you don't mind brown chips, you can skip this step.",
        "Brushing the juice onto both sides of the bananas will also work.",
        "Pineapple juice, lime juice, or any other acidic juice will work instead.",
        "You can even use vitamin C tablets crushed in water.",
        "If you don't like the flavor of the juice, dilute it in a 1:4 ratio with water and soak the bananas for 3-5 minutes.",
        "Place the bananas on a wire rack.",
        "This raised wire platform exposes every side of the banana to the air and allows excess moisture to drip through.",
        "Also ready a cookie sheet or baking pan to place beneath it.",
        "The bananas should be in a single layer, not stacked atop each other.",
        "It's fine if their edges are touching.",
        "If you don't have a wire rack, cover a cookie sheet with parchment paper or spray it with a nonstick cooking spray.",
        "This method will be less effective at removing moisture and could take many hours longer (especially for wedges).",
        "You can mitigate this by leaving the oven door a few inches ajar to allow moisture to escape.",
        "An electric fan kept next to the open oven door will also help air circulate.",
        "Add additional flavor if desired.",
        "A sprinkling of sea salt or kosher salt adds a great savory flavor, perfect for eating on their own.",
        "Place the bananas in the preheated oven.",
        "Use the center rack of the oven and be careful not to drop any slices onto the oven floor.",
        "If using a wire rack, place the baking sheet in the oven first to catch drips, then place the rack on top of the baking sheet.",
        "Let them bake according to shape and desired crispiness.",
        "For chips, this will take 1 to 3 hours.",
        "Wedges will take 6 to 12 hours.",
        "The longer you bake them, the crispier they will be.",
        "Flip the bananas over once about halfway through the baking process.",
        "This will dry each side evenly and is especially important if the bananas are placed directly on a baking sheet.",
        "The bananas will become crispier as they cool, so remove them when they're still a little softer than you would like.",
        "Cool the bananas completely on a wire rack.",
        "They won't be completely dry or crunchy until they're cooled to room temperature.",
        "If you don't have a wire rack, a dish-drying rack can work instead.",
        "An ordinary plate will still do in a pinch.",
        "Store the bananas in an airtight container.",
        "If completely dried, they should stay good for months.",
        "Chips or Chews in a Dehydrator Prepare the bananas.",
        "The early preparation is similar to the oven method, but pay attention to the sizes.",
        "Peel the bananas and slice them in 1/4 inch rounds (0.6 cm) to produce leathery chews, or slice them 1/16 to 1/8 inches thick (0.15 to 0.3 cm) to make crunchy chips.",
        "Chips will take up to 24 hours to dehydrate, whereas leather should be done within 12.",
        "Plan accordingly.",
        "Slices smaller than 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) will tend to stick together when stored.",
        "Dip the pieces in lemon juice to prevent the chips from turning brown.",
        "This step is optional.",
        "Add additional flavor if desired.",
        "Grated nutmeg works well with the bananas' natural sweetness.",
        "Spray or rub a little oil on the rack of your dehydrator.",
        "This step isn't mandatory but will prevent the banana slices from sticking.",
        "You could even rub oil directly onto the bananas to be extra cautious.",
        "Place the slices on the dehydrator's drying rack.",
        "None of the slices should overlap.",
        "It's fine if they touch slightly; they should shrink a little as they dry.",
        "Set the temperature to 135\u00ba F (57\u00baC).",
        "Making leathery chews will take anywhere from 6 to 12 hours.",
        "Crisp chips will take longer, up to a full 24 hour day.",
        "If your model of dehydrator comes with specific instructions for bananas, use the temperature and time listed there instead.",
        "Check their progress every 2-4 hours and rotate the tray to ensure even drying.",
        "If you decided not to put lemon juice on them, the caramel brown color is a good sign that they're done or nearly done.",
        "Otherwise, you can take a sample out to taste test once it's cooled to room temperature.",
        "If you leave your chews in too long and dislike the extra-tough texture, continue to dehydrate them and turn them into crisps.",
        "This may not work if the slices are extra thick.",
        "Cool the bananas to room temperature before eating.",
        "If you store them in an airtight container, they should stay good for months.",
        "Fruit Leather in a Dehydrator Peel the bananas.",
        "You can keep them whole or slice them in half lengthwise.",
        "Place the whole bananas between two sheets of parchment paper.",
        "The bananas should be at least 3 inches apart from one another.",
        "Use a heavy cutting board to smash the bananas.",
        "Try to apply even pressure to keep the banana mash an even consistency.",
        "You can also use a rolling pin for this.",
        "The goal is to get the bananas down to about 1/8 of an inch (0.3 cm).",
        "If you don't want to measure them, just make it as flat as you can!",
        "Transfer the parchment paper to the dehydrator rack.",
        "Peel off the top sheet before you begin dehydrating.",
        "Set your dehydrator to 135\u00baF (57\u00baC) for 7 hours.",
        "Check in at the 4 and 6-hour mark to see how they're doing.",
        "When ready, the top should be leathery but not sticky.",
        "If the bottom is still moist, you can optionally flip them over halfway through.",
        "Let cool and slice into strips.",
        "These can be rolled up and stored in an airtight container for several months.",
        "Microwave Crisps Peel and slice the bananas.",
        "Aim for 1/4 inch rounds (0.6 cm) or slightly smaller.",
        "Larger slices won't cook as well, while smaller ones burn more easily.",
        "Oil a microwave-safe plate.",
        "Use a generous amount of pleasantly flavored oil such as olive or coconut oil.",
        "Place the banana slices on the plate with space between each one.",
        "Microwave on high for one minute.",
        "The bananas should start turning soft and releasing moisture.",
        "Turn each slice over.",
        "You can also add additional flavor at this point.",
        "A sprinkling of sea salt or kosher salt adds a great savory flavor, while grated nutmeg or ground cinnamon works well with the bananas' sweetness.",
