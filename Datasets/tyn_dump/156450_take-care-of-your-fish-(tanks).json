These fish need a consistent aquarium heater in order to survive. Many warm water fish serve as a beautiful but low-maintenance addition to an aquarium. Maintaining the water temperature is very important for this type of fish. Check the heater often and consider getting an aquarium thermometer."

In addition, some tropical fish are hardy enough to live without a heater. Loaches, minnows, danios, and even crayfish and shrimp live in cooler waters. Coldwater fish tend to be hardier than tropical fish, but they often need more room. A well-kept goldfish will grow much bigger than you expect! Coldwater fish often require a water temperature a little below what tropical fish need. A goldfish, for instance, requires water between 65 and 72 \u00b0F (18 and 22 \u00b0C)."

Saltwater fish tend to be more expensive and require you to keep a close watch on the aquarium\u2019s salinity level. If you are willing to watch the salinity, saltwater fish are almost as easy to care for as any tropical breed. Some examples of saltwater fish include firefish, yellow shrimp goby, Klein\u2019s butterfly fish, and coral beauty angelfish. Metal components in saltwater will rust over time. Get a tank and equipment designed for use with saltwater to reduce rusting."

                    "description": "You may feel tempted to fill your tank with whatever colorful species you can find. Before choosing a fish, read up about what fish go well together. Stick to a limited number of fish from a few species, avoiding any that are territorial or predatory. Try to get fish that originated from the same part of the world, since they are more likely to live together peacefully in nature. If you\u2019re unsure about which fish to get, ask employees at the pet store for advice. For example, betta fish are known as fighting fish. They are territorial around other bettas. In addition, they will attack other species that nibble at their fins. They coexist with neon tetras and corydoras. Goldfish sometimes eat fish smaller than them. They live well with rosy barbs, loaches, and danios, but may still attack them at times."

When something goes wrong with the tank, such as a problem with the pH, the change is much slower in a larger tank than in a smaller tank. In addition, larger tanks provide spaces for individual fish or schools. If you\u2019re unsure what size you need, select a fish breed you like and research its needs. Bigger fish needs bigger tanks. For example, a small fish like a tetra or guppy needs a minimum of 5 gallons (19 L) of water. A school of these fish need a minimum of 15 gallons (57 L). Get a 20 gallons (76 L) tank to hold goldfish. Choose a tank that holds an extra 10 gallons (38 L) for every additional goldfish you plan on keeping. Use a tank that holds 10 gallons (38 L) of water to keep a clownfish. Increase the tank size to 60 gallons (230 L) to hold a school of them."

Slide the parts out and set them in a bowl filled with water from the tank. Swirl the filter around in the water to clean it. This is also a good time to check the filter chamber. If it looks dirty or has algae in it, scrub it with an algae brush and water from the tank. If the filter pad still looks dirty after rinsing it, replace it. Another way to tell is by how slowly water cycles through the tank. A slowed water flow is often a sign of a clogged filter, which is fixable with a new filter pad and some scrubbing.",

        " Choosing Fish and a Tank Start with tropical fish if your aquarium is heated.",
        "Most aquarium fish sold in stores are tropical fish.",
        "There are many types to choose from, including neon tetras, guppies, and bettas.",
        "These fish need a consistent aquarium heater in order to survive.",
        "Many warm water fish serve as a beautiful but low-maintenance addition to an aquarium.",
        "Maintaining the water temperature is very important for this type of fish.",
        "Check the heater often and consider getting an aquarium thermometer.",

        "Goldfish and minnows are a few popular fish for aquariums without heaters.",
        "Many subtropical fish survive well in cool aquariums.",
        "In addition, some tropical fish are hardy enough to live without a heater.",
        "Loaches, minnows, danios, and even crayfish and shrimp live in cooler waters.",
        "Coldwater fish tend to be hardier than tropical fish, but they often need more room.",
        "A well-kept goldfish will grow much bigger than you expect!",
        "Coldwater fish often require a water temperature a little below what tropical fish need.",
        "A goldfish, for instance, requires water between 65 and 72 \u00b0F (18 and 22 \u00b0C).",
        "Raise saltwater fish for hardier pets that require more maintenance.",
        "Saltwater fish are a little trickier to maintain than freshwater fish.",
        "Saltwater fish tend to be more expensive and require you to keep a close watch on the aquarium\u2019s salinity level.",
        "If you are willing to watch the salinity, saltwater fish are almost as easy to care for as any tropical breed.",
        "Some examples of saltwater fish include firefish, yellow shrimp goby, Klein\u2019s butterfly fish, and coral beauty angelfish.",
        "Metal components in saltwater will rust over time.",
        "Get a tank and equipment designed for use with saltwater to reduce rusting.",
        "Pick fish that go well together in a tank.",
        "You may feel tempted to fill your tank with whatever colorful species you can find.",
        "Before choosing a fish, read up about what fish go well together.",
        "Stick to a limited number of fish from a few species, avoiding any that are territorial or predatory.",
        "Try to get fish that originated from the same part of the world, since they are more likely to live together peacefully in nature.",
        "If you\u2019re unsure about which fish to get, ask employees at the pet store for advice.",
        "For example, betta fish are known as fighting fish.",
        "They are territorial around other bettas.",
        "In addition, they will attack other species that nibble at their fins.",
        "They coexist with neon tetras and corydoras.",
        "Goldfish sometimes eat fish smaller than them.",
        "They live well with rosy barbs, loaches, and danios, but may still attack them at times.",
        "Pick an appropriately-sized tank for the fish you wish to keep.",
        "Larger tanks are much easier to maintain and work well for any fish you plan on including in your aquarium.",
        "When something goes wrong with the tank, such as a problem with the pH, the change is much slower in a larger tank than in a smaller tank.",
        "In addition, larger tanks provide spaces for individual fish or schools.",
        "If you\u2019re unsure what size you need, select a fish breed you like and research its needs.",
        "Bigger fish needs bigger tanks.",
        "For example, a small fish like a tetra or guppy needs a minimum of 5 gallons (19 L) of water.",

        "Use a tank that holds 10 gallons (38 L) of water to keep a clownfish.",
        "Increase the tank size to 60 gallons (230 L) to hold a school of them.",
        "Setting up a Tank Set the tank away from sources of heat and cold.",
        "Temperature fluxes have dangerous effects on both tank water and glass.",
        "Some parts of your home to avoid include open windows letting in direct sunlight, drafty basements, furnaces, and fireplaces.",
        "Find a spot where the temperature and sunlight stay level throughout the day.",
        "Remember that fish tanks are controlled environments.",
        "Any little change may have drastic effects.",
        "Sunlight, for example, warms water and facilitates algae growth.",
        "Level out the tank so it doesn\u2019t crack when you add water.",
        "Set the tank on a stable surface, then use a bubble level to test it.",
        "Place the bubble on the top edges of the tank.",
        "The bubble in the center of the level will move to the side if the tank is uneven.",
        "Water will also flow towards the uneven side, putting extra pressure on the glass.",
        "Getting the tank perfectly level is difficult.",
        "Put the tank on a level stand on flat ground to get it as level as possible.",
        "Put wooden shims underneath the tank to make small elevation adjustments Install an aquarium heater and filter system in the tank.",
        "You will need these submersible systems in order to regulate the waters for your fish.",
        "First, choose systems rated as compatible with the size of tank you have.",
        "Assemble the components, such as by pushing the filter inside its tube housing.",
        "Most heaters and filters are easy to install, since all you have to do is drape them over the walls of the tank and plug them into a wall outlet.",
        "Heaters and filters are available in different models.",
        "Some manufacturers, for example, require you to place the filter underneath gravel.",
        "Heaters have adjustable settings.",
        "You twist the knob on the heater to determine how hot it makes the water.",
        "The setting you choose depends on what your fish need.",
        "Tropical aquariums usually need to be between 75 and 80 \u00b0F (24 and 27 \u00b0C), for instance.",
        "Add a substrate to the tank and plant decorations in it.",
        "Spread enough aquarium gravel or sand to hide the bottom of the tank.",
        "Rinse all the decorations in warm tap water before pushing them into the gravel.",
        "Press them down into the gravel until they stick in place.",
        "Include plastic decorations like a castle or a pirate ship for variety and shelter in the tank.",
        "When choosing aquarium plants, consider the tank\u2019s environment.",
        "Plants like water wisteria, Amazon sword, hornwort, and java fern do well in tropical freshwater tanks but aren\u2019t appropriate for saltwater tanks.",
        "Fill the tank with lukewarm tap water and dechlorinate it.",
        "Since you don\u2019t have any fish in the tank yet, add the tap water directly to it.",
        "Fill it all the way up, then add some water conditioner into the water.",
        "Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions to add the appropriate amount for the size of tank you own.",
        "When the water is ready, scoop some up and pour it into the tank\u2019s filter to get it ready.",
        "Water conditioner is available at pet supply stores.",
        "Don\u2019t use dechlorinators like those made for pools.",
        "Get a product designed for fish water.",
        "The water needs to be lukewarm so it doesn\u2019t damage the tank.",
        "Don\u2019t let cracked glass ruin your fish\u2019s new home!",
        "Mix marine salt into the water if the tank is for saltwater fish.",
        "Purchase salt made for use in fish tanks, then follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions to treat the water with the right amount.",
        "Depending on the product, you may need about 5.5 cups of salt (1501.5 g) of salt for every 16 cups (3,800 mL) of water.",
        "Stir the water thoroughly with an aquarium net or another tool.",
        "You will need to repeat this process whenever you add fresh water to the tank.",
        "Run the tank\u2019s systems for at least 24 hours before adding fish.",
        "Doing a \u201cfishless cycle\u201d with the tank\u2019s heat lights and filter gives beneficial bacteria a chance to grow.",
        "Fish, uneaten food, and rotting plants give off nitrogen.",
        "Some bacteria converts nitrogen to nitrates while a second type of bacteria converts the nitrites to harmless nitrates.",
        "These bacteria need some time to get established in the tank.",
        "If you add the fish too soon, you will see a significant spike in nitrogen and nitrates when you test the water.",
        "This could be harmful to your fish!",
        "For saltwater fish, give the tank at least 3 weeks for it to cycle.",
        "If you have time, set the tank up in advance and let it cycle for a few extra weeks to ensure your new pets are safe.",
        "Maintaining a Fish Tank Feed fish a little bit of food twice a day.",
        "The amount of food you need to add depends on the size of your fish and how many of them you have.",
        "Start out with small amounts of food so you don\u2019t overfeed them.",
        "Fish generally need about 3 to 5 fish food pellets or a similar amount of fish flakes.",
        "Feed the fish at the same time every day.",
        "Overfeeding is a serious problem that harms fish.",
        "Fish generally eat themselves sick.",
        "Any food they miss ends up rotting in the tank, leading to problems like algae growth.",
        "Read about the dietary needs of the species you keep.",
        "Each species is different.",
        "Scrub algae off the tank walls every other week.",
        "Get an algae brush from a pet supply store.",
        "Scrubbers have a rough pad for brushing off algae and a sharper edge for scraping off stubborn remnants.",
        "Work from the bottom up, letting the algae fall to the tank floor, then vacuum it up with an aquarium siphon.",
        "Algae consumes oxygen that your fish and aquarium plants need to survive, so remove green spots as soon as you see them forming.",
        "Some places also sell algae magnets.",
        "To use the magnet, you hold it against the outside surface of the aquarium, then vacuum up the algae like usual.",
        "Another way to deal with algae is by keeping a snail or algae-eating fish in the tank.",
        "Test the water pH and makeup at least once a month.",
        "Purchase a water testing kit designed for aquariums.",
        "Testing strips are the easiest to use since all you have to do is dunk the testing strip into the aquarium water.",
        "Other tests require you to take water samples, then mix it with a drop of the included dye.",
        "Follow the testing instructions to ensure the environment is right for your fish friends.",
        "Freshwater fish prefer a pH level between 5.5 and 7.5.",
        "Saltwater fish need a pH level over 8.0.",
        "Each species of fish has different needs, so do some research online to find the perfect level.",
        "Ideally, the water will have 0 ammonia, 0 nitrite, and 5 to 10 parts per million of nitrate.",
        "If you have saltwater fish, make sure your kit tests for water salinity.",
        "The ideal level is 35 parts per thousand.",
        "Vacuum the gravel with a siphon at least twice a month.",
        "Fish tank siphons are long tubes with a vacuum at the end.",
        "Set the free end of the tube in a large bucket you use only for aquarium maintenance.",
        "Then, press the vacuum lightly against the gravel.",
        "Use it to collect debris in the gravel, such as uneaten fish food and algae.",
        "Return any siphoned gravel to the fish tank.",
        "If it looks dirty, rinse it off in some of the siphoned tank water.",
        "Wash your hands before handling the gravel so you don\u2019t introduce bacteria to the tank.",
        "Replace up to 25% of the tank water every 2 weeks.",
        "Use your gravel vacuum to drain some of the water into a big bucket.",
        "You don\u2019t need to remove the fish from the tank.",
        "Then, prepare to replace the lost water with an equal amount of clean water.",
        "The old water can be disposed of or repurposed, such as to water any plants in your home.",
        "The best time to do a water change is when you\u2019re vacuuming the gravel.",
        "The vacuum will suck up some water, so combine the tasks.",
        "Aim on removing 10% to 15% of the water if you vacuum the tank weekly.",
        "Refill the tank with warm, dechlorinated water.",
        "Put the water in a bucket first before adding it to the tank.",
        "Check it with a thermometer to make sure it\u2019s at a similar temperature to the water in the tank.",
        "Then, treat it with some bottled water conditioner from a pet supply store.",
        "Read the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for the recommended amount to mix into the water.",
        "Treat the water with supplies you only use for the aquarium.",
        "For example, use an aquarium net for a safe and easy way to mix conditioner into the water.",
        "This is because any item you use elsewhere may introduce soap or bacteria into the tank water.",
        "If you keep saltwater fish, also mix marine salt into the replacement water according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.",
        "Rinse the filter every month and replace it when it gets dirty.",
        "Unplug the filter to turn it off, then open it up to access its internal components.",
