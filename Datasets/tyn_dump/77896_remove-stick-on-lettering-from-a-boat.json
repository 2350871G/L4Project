Start with a razor blade  It is usually best to get the long, skinny razors with extend able blades, but this does depend somewhat on personal preference. The short fat ones work as well. Try slipping the blade under the letters. Most letters you should be able to get off this way. As long as you are careful, you shouldn't have a problem scratching the fiberglass, but watch what you're doing with the blade."
