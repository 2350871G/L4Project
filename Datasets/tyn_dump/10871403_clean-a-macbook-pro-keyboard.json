Try tapping all of the keys on your keyboard repeatedly and then shake it over the trashcan again. Tapping the keys helps to dislodge dirt and other material that may have collected over the weeks, or years, since the last time you cleaned your keyboard. You may see some unwanted debris fall out as you gently shake the laptop, but don't be discouraged if you don't. Doing this will still help break up unwanted gunk that will be dealt with as you continue cleaning."

This angle helps dirt, dust, and debris fall out, rather than pushing them deeper into your laptop. You'll want to move the compressed air from left to right, moving down the length of the keyboard and then back up to make sure you have reached every pocket. Be sure to keep the end of the straw about a half-inch away from the keyboard. Avoid inverting the can while you are spraying. You may want to get a friend to help you hold your computer at this angle while you spray. If you have a MacBook Pro that is older than the 2016 model you can skip the compressed air. Using compressed air on older models of the MacBook Pro can force dust deeper into the laptop, rather than blowing it out."

Maintain the same 75-degree angle to be sure that dust continues to fall out of your keyboard. Rotating your computer in this way helps the compressed air continue to clean out all the nooks and crannies found beneath your keyboard. Don't forget to keep the end of the straw about half an inch away from the keyboard. The compressed air has enough force that it will be able to clean out the keys from that distance. Spraying it any closer could damage the keys."

Continue to lead the compressed air from left to right, tracking up and down the keyboard in a zig-zag manner. This is a good time to do a final once-over with the can of compressed air. If you think you may have missed a spot, take the time now to access it. You may want to give your laptop one more gentle shake over the trashcan, for good measure."

Cleaning with disinfectant gets rid of any spills, stains, and especially dirty crevices. This will also get rid of unseen germs and bacteria. It is not uncommon for a small amount of grime to accumulate on the surface of your keyboard, so take your time as you wipe the surface and apply extra attention to food spills or grimy corners. Be gentle with the keys by pressing lightly, although you can scrub harder on dirtier sections if you're careful. Make sure your disinfectant wipes don't contain bleach. Apple suggests Lysol Wipes or Clorox Kitchen Disinfecting Wipes. You can also use electronics cleaner and a microfiber cloth in place of the disinfectant wipes. Or, try making a cleaning solution yourself, using equal parts water and rubbing alcohol. Be really careful to avoid liquid pooling around your keyboard. Have a dry towel on hand to mop up any spilled cleaning solution. Avoid spraying liquid directly onto the keyboard (apply to a lint-free, microfiber cloth, instead). Remember that liquid is not a friend to your keyboard. The last thing you want to do is damage your keyboard while you're trying to clean it. Less is more when it comes to using cleaning solution."
