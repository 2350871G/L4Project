Using circular motions, gently work the cleanser into your skin, making sure not to skip your hairline, eye area, or neck. Then, rinse your face until it's clean and pat it dry with a clean towel. Work the cleanser into your skin for at least 20-30 seconds, making sure to get every crease and corner of your face."

Be sure to apply sunscreen liberally to your face and neck at least 15-30 minutes before you go outside. You can also use two separate products by applying a simple moisturizer and following it with a sunscreen of 30 SPF or greater. You should wear sunscreen every day, even when it's not sunny outside."

Use a color correcting primer on your bruise before applying any other makeup. Since bruises change color as they heal, you'll want a different color primer for each stage of your bruise. Purchase a color correcting palette with a wide variety of colors. To figure out which color to use take a quick look at the color wheel. Orange cancels out blue, green cancels out red, purple cancels out yellow, and yellow cancels out purple."
