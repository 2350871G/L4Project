Some cages are bi-level and come with specialty ramps and spots to attach a hammock. Don\u2019t keep your ferret in an aquarium. The solid sides prevent the flow of air and makes it a poor habitat for ferrets. Make sure that any cage that you select has a solid, secure latch.

Look for a quality dry ferret food that contains ingredients at these levels. You can also talk with your vet about using high-quality kitten food as well. Ferrets enjoy small, cut-up snacks of cooked turkey, cooked egg, or chicken meat. Avoid giving your ferret fresh fruits or vegetables. The sugars in fruits can irritate your ferret\u2019s digestive system. And, ferrets have been known to choke on raw vegetables.
