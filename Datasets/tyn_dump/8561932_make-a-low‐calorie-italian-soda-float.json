    "text": " Making Fresh Fruit Italian Soda Float Scoop fresh ice into the glass. Adding ice to your float is the first step in this healthy, low-calorie alternative. You can either use cubed or crushed ice depending on your preference. Combine a handful of strawberries and blueberries to the glass. Add your frozen fruit to the glass of ice. Frozen fruit will impart a fresh, fruity flavor to your drink and won't get mushy because it's frozen. Fill your glass 3/4 of the way with sparkling water. You can use any sparkling water flavor that you like, but raspberry, orange, and strawberry taste best for this recipe. Because there's no syrup in this drink, it's important to use a flavored sparkling water or else your drink will be tasteless. Add 2 tablespoons (29.57 ml) of half-and-half or almond milk. Almond milk is a lower-fat alternative to half-and-half, so use if you're trying to cut down on your calories. I addition to being lower in fat than half-and-half, almond milk is a non-dairy. Once you've added the almond milk to the drink, stir it up to mix all of the ingredients together. Top the drink with vanilla ice cream. Take a large scoop of vanilla ice cream and top the beverage that you just made. You can also use a soy based ice cream for a non-dairy alternative. The ice cream should float on the top and slowly melt into the drink. You can now enjoy your Italian float with a spoon or straw. Creating a Mint Italian Soda Float Divide the sorbet into two separate glasses. Use a scooper or a tablespoon to scoop two equal portions of sorbet into each glass. You can purchase flavored sorbet at most grocery stores. Make sure to read the calorie count for the sorbet you are buying. Add the club soda to the glass. Pour 1 cup (237 ml) of club soda into each glass. The sorbet and the soda should mix and give your drink a pink or reddish color. Top each glass with half-and-half or almond milk. Put one tablespoon (4.9 ml) of almond milk or half-and-half into each glass. You can also use fat-free half-and-half or evaporated skim milk as a healthy replacement for half-and-half. Garnish the top with a sprig of mint. Break off two pieces of fresh mint and place them on the top of each drink. Use a straw to sip the float. Making Blood Orange Italian Soda Float Boil the zest, blood orange juice and agave nectar in a saucepan. Set your stovetop to medium-high and add your 1 cup (237 ml) of blood orange juice and 1/3 cup (100 grams) agave nectar to the pan. Sprinkle the zest into the mixture and bring the solution to a boil. You can also use other fruit juice or crushed fresh fruit for a replacement for blood orange. Simmer the solution for 10 minutes on low. Cover your saucepan and reduce the stovetop to low. Let the mixture simmer for the next 10 minutes and continue to stir until the agave nectar dissolves and incorporates with the other ingredients. Take the syrup off the stovetop and strain it. When the color of your syrup darkens, you should take it off of the stovetop. Use a fine mesh sieve and strain your syrup to remove any of the zest remaining in it. Let your syrup chill in the refrigerator. Allow your syrup to cool in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before trying to assemble your Italian soda float. If you are making the floats at a later date, you can keep the syrup in the refrigerator for up to a week, covered. Pour 1/4 cup (59.14 ml) of blood orange syrup and ice into two glasses.
