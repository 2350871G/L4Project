Some deciduous plants have thorns on their branches, which can help protect your yard or garden from large animals, such as deer.Warning: Avoid using plants like Japanese barberry, burning bush, autumn olive, or privet since they are considered invasive and can quickly grow out of control if you aren\u2019t able to maintain them properly."

        "Buy the same species of shrub so your hedge fence looks uniform.",
        "For example, if you want a 15 ft (460 cm) hedge fence, you would divide 15 by 3 to get 5.",
        "Therefore, you will need to plant 5 shrubs.",
        "You can choose different species of shrubs if you want your fence to have a more natural look, though it may not grow as dense.",
        "Planting the Hedgerow Dig a trench 2 times wider and the same depth as the largest shrub\u2019s root ball.",
        "Measure the diameters and heights of the root balls for each shrub you purchased with a measuring tape to find the largest.",
        "Find the spot in your yard where you want to plant your hedge fence and begin digging with a shovel.",
        "Start with the middle of the trench first before expanding it wider so you can easily measure the size.",
        "For example, if the root ball was 1 \u20442 feet (46 cm) wide and 2 feet (61 cm) tall, then your trench should be 3 feet (0.91 m) wide and 2 feet (0.61 m) deep.",
        "You can also rent a mini-excavator or trench digger from a heavy machinery supply store if you want to dig the trench more quickly.Tip: Spray paint the outline of the trench on the ground so you can see how much more you need to dig.",
        "Mix compost and manure into the excavated soil to provide more nutrients.",
        "Look for bags of compost and manure at your local gardening center.",
        "Pour 1 part compost and 1 part manure for every 2 parts of soil that you dug out of the trench.",
        "Use your shovel to turn the compost and manure into the soil until it\u2019s thoroughly mixed together.",
        "You can also use your own compost for your hedge.",
        "Mix the soil with your manure and compost in a wheelbarrow if it\u2019s easier for you.",
        "Tease the roots out from the shrubs with a hand cultivator.",
        "A hand cultivator is a small metal claw that breaks apart soil without ripping through the roots.",
        "Pull the shrubs out from their pots by the base of the trunk or cut through the burlap around the root ball.",
        "Drag the claw of the cultivator gently across the soil around the roots to expose them.",
        "Don\u2019t remove all of the soil from the root ball, or else you could damage the shrub.",
        "You can buy a hand cultivator from your local gardening store.",
        "You may also break the soil off by hand if you don\u2019t have a hand cultivator.",
        "Wear gardening gloves so you don\u2019t get any skin irritation while you\u2019re working.",
        "Set your plants in the trench so they\u2019re 3\u20134 ft (0.91\u20131.22 m) apart.",
        "Position the first shrub so it\u2019s 1 \u20442\u20132 feet (46\u201361 cm) from the end of the trench since it will grow and expand.",
        "Keep the shrub in the middle of the trench, and turn it so the fullest side faces your home.",
        "Set the next shrub so its trunk is 3\u20134 feet (0.91\u20131.22 m) from the first shrub\u2019s trunk.",
        "Continue placing the shrubs along the entire length of the hedge fence.",
        "Don\u2019t plant the shrubs any closer together, or else they\u2019ll compete for nutrients and won\u2019t grow fully.",
        "Backfill the soil to form mounds around the shrubs\u2019 trunks.",
        "Use your shovel or a wheelbarrow to pour the mixture of soil, compost, and manure back in the trench.",
        "Make sure you completely cover the roots for each shrub so they\u2019re not exposed.",
        "Compact the soil around the shrubs\u2019 trunks to form small mounds so water doesn\u2019t gather and cause rot.",
        "Water the plants until the soil is wet 1 in (2.5 cm) deep.",
        "Use a watering can or a garden hose with a sprayer attachment when you water the shrubs.",
        "Pour the water as close to the roots as you can so it can absorb into the soil and provide nutrients.",
        "Stick your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle to feel if the soil is damp.",
        "If it isn\u2019t, continue watering until it does.",
        "Avoid using a jet attachment on your hose since you could harm the plants or disturb the soil.",
        "You can also use a sprinkler to water your plants.",
        "Cover the soil with a 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) layer of mulch.",
        "Shovel or pour the mulch on top of the soil between the shrubs.",
        "Use a rake to spread the mulch in an even layer on the soil so it\u2019s about 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) deep.",
        "Keep the mulch 2 in (5.1 cm) away from the trunks of the shrubs since they could cause rot.",
        "You can buy mulch from your local gardening store.",
        "Mulch helps retain moisture in the soil and prevents weeds from growing underneath your hedge.",
        "Caring for Your Hedges Water the hedge once per week until the soil is completely saturated.",
        "Use your watering can or hose to provide water for the shrubs.",
        "Try to water the soil evenly around the roots so they can absorb the nutrients and keep the shrubs healthy.",
        "Check the soil by sticking your finger into the ground down to the first knuckle.",
        "If the soil feels damp, then you can stop watering.",
        "If not, continue watering and check again in 5 minutes.",
        "If it rains heavily during the week, then you don\u2019t need to water your hedges.",
        "Run a drip irrigation system underneath your hedges to provide water for them regularly without having to do it yourself.",
        "Check for signs of pests or diseases weekly to keep your hedges healthy.",
        "Inspect the leaves of the hedges to see if they have holes, bites, or scaly damage on them.",
        "Lift the leaves and check the undersides to see if there are any bugs on them.",
        "If you find pests, spray a commercial pesticide on the shrubs to get rid of them.",
        "If you notice dead branches, shriveled foliage, or yellowing leaves, cut off the affected area so the disease doesn\u2019t spread.",
        "Common garden pests include aphids, scale insects, and spider mites.",
        "Diseases include powdery mildew, bacterial canker, and blight.Tip: If you aren\u2019t sure what\u2019s wrong with your shrubs, take a clipping of the affected area and take it to your local garden center to diagnose the problem.",
        "Trim the hedges in the late winter so they get narrower at the top.",
        "Opt to prune your hedges after any buds or flowers turn brown so you don\u2019t remove healthy growths.",
        "Hold an electric trimmer so the blade is parallel to the side you\u2019re trimming.",
        "Guide the hedge trimmer straight across the tops and sides of the shrubs to cut back about \u2153 of the growth.",
        "Make sure the top of the hedge tapers narrower than the base, or else the lower branches won\u2019t be able to get sunlight.",
        "Hedges usually need to stay at least 3 feet (0.91 m) thick so they can stay healthy and grow.",
        "Clip branches inside the hedge every 2\u20133 ft (0.61\u20130.91 m) whenever you prune.",
        "Reach into the middle of your hedge and grab 1\u20132 branches.",
        "Cut the branches at a 45-degree angle with a pair of hand pruners so water doesn\u2019t pool on top of them.",
        "Move at least 2 feet (61 cm) down the hedge and cut 1\u20132 more interior branches.",
        "Continue cutting along the length of the entire hedge fence.",
        "Removing interior branches allows more airflow and light to reach the inside of the hedge.",
        "Wear long sleeves and gardening gloves if your hedge has thorny branches so you don\u2019t hurt yourself.",
        "Spread 10-10-10 fertilizer around the hedges every spring.",
        "Go to your local gardening store and look for a granular fertilizer to use on your hedges.",
        "Scoop out the recommended amount of fertilizer on the package and pour it around the base of the hedge.",
        "Water the hedge immediately so the fertilizer can soak into the soil and provide nutrients to your plants.",
        "Avoid letting the fertilizer touch the trunks of the shrubs since you could damage them."
