Measure the distance between the middle part of each leg to figure out how long the apron rails need to be. The exact size the boards need to be will vary depending on where you place the legs. Normally, they are easiest to fashion when the legs are placed right near the table corners, but they don\u2019t have to be put there. If your table already has an apron attached, you will see wood panels attached to the underside. Skip this part and screw the legs to the apron rails or remove the rails to cut mortise and tenon joints. A mortise and tenon joint is a secure way to connect pieces of wood by making them fit together. A mortise is a slot, which is often cut into table legs. A tenon is a same-sized projection that fits into a mortise. The mortise and tenon technique is a classic way to create stable tables.

After marking the cuts you need to make, lower the router and carefully move around the outlines. Note the thickness of the table legs, taking care not to cut more than \u00be of the way through them. Using a router can be dangerous if you\u2019re not careful. Keep a firm grip on it with both hands and keep your fingers up on the safety guards. Move it slowly and shut it off when you\u2019re done. One way to make the cutting process easier is to drill holes at the ends of each mortise outline, then follow up with the router. Doing this can make the router glide a little more smoothly over the wood. Each leg will have a pair of mortises for the apron rails connecting it to adjacent legs. Make sure the mortise cuts look smooth. If you don\u2019t have a router, you could also use a dowel jig to drill holes into each leg and rail. Then, fit wood dowels into the holes. The dowels will allow you to push the pieces together just like with a mortise and tenon design."

If you\u2019re not using wood, make sure you choose something compatible with the type of material you\u2019re using. When you\u2019re done, fit the pieces back together and clamp them in place for about 24 hours to dry. Let the pieces dry completely before turning the table back over. Use some effective bar clamps or a similar tool to keep the rails and legs pushed together until the glue solidifies. Another option is to screw the rails and legs together. Getting the screws in the right place is tough, so it can easily make your table uneven. To do it, drill the screws diagonally down through the table legs and into the rails."

Installing T-Nuts Purchase 4 T-nuts and hanger bolts. T-nuts are circular connectors that attach to the table\u2019s underside. Each T-nut has a central opening used to secure a table leg. When selecting T-nuts, be sure to compare them to the hanger bolts you plan on using. Get bolts that are the same diameter as the opening on the T-nuts. The equipment you need is available online or at most home improvement stores. T-nuts are useful for tables you plan on moving a lot. They work well on any type of wood table without an apron but are best for unfinished tables. If you plan on covering the table with another piece of wood or upholstery, T-nuts are a good choice.

The exact positioning depends on where you want the legs to be. They are often placed close to the corners but can be moved according to your preference. If you need more precision when placing the T-nuts, measure out from the edges and mark where each one needs to go. Drill 4 holes through the base of the tabletop. Create the holes in the spots where you plan on placing the legs. Keep the holes roughly the same size as the openings in the T-nuts. The exact size will depend on the T-nuts you plan on using, so refer to their length and diameter. It will be labeled on the packaging. For example, \u204416 in (0.79 cm) is a common T-nut diameter. Create same-sized holes with a power drill. Be wary of the table\u2019s thickness so you don\u2019t drill all the way through it. Use shorter T-nuts if your table is too thin to support the ones you purchased. Tap the T-nuts into the holes with a hammer. Place a T-nut into each of the holes you drilled. Position them so the wider, circular end is face up. Gradually tap each T-nut down with a light amount of force until it is level with the wood. The opposite end of each T-nut is a central circle with a smaller opening. This side goes into the wood. The base of each T-nut has small blades that will also pass into the wood as you hammer. Drill a pilot hole through the center of each table leg unless they have pre-installed hanger bolts. Arrange the legs so the top part, meant to connect to the table, faces you. Before drilling pilot holes, refer to the diameter of the hanger screws you purchased. Choose a drill size slightly smaller than that. When you\u2019re ready, drill holes that are the same length as the hanger screws. For accuracy, take time to measure out and mark the center point on each leg if you need to.

Cutting Mortises and Tenons Put on a dust mask and safety glasses before cutting the table. Protect yourself from the dust and possible wood shards released during the cutting process. If you can, work outdoors to further reduce the amount of dust you have to contend with. Also, avoid wearing a long-sleeved shirt, gloves, or jewelry that could get caught by the saw. If you can\u2019t work outdoors, select a well-ventilated spot like a workspace with a strong ventilation fan. Open up nearby doors and windows to direct more of the dust out. Keep other people and pets out of the area until you are done and have had a chance to clean up. Cut boards into rails for the table\u2019s underside if there isn\u2019t an attached apron. These rail boards fit between the table legs, creating an apron. Flip the table over, then rough fit the legs near the table corners. Place the boards between them, measuring the length and size you need them to be. Plan on cutting 4 boards so you have 1 that fits between each leg. Measure the distance between the middle part of each leg to figure out how long the apron rails need to be. The exact size the boards need to be will vary depending on where you place the legs. Normally, they are easiest to fashion when the legs are placed right near the table corners, but they don\u2019t have to be put there. If your table already has an apron attached, you will see wood panels attached to the underside. Skip this part and screw the legs to the apron rails or remove the rails to cut mortise and tenon joints. A mortise and tenon joint is a secure way to connect pieces of wood by making them fit together. A mortise is a slot, which is often cut into table legs. A tenon is a same-sized projection that fits into a mortise. The mortise and tenon technique is a classic way to create stable tables. It\u2019s often used for big tables that require plenty of stability, such as picnic or dining room tables. It can also be done for metal. Mark spots to cut the mortise and tenons in the boards. Plan on cutting mortise slots into the table legs and matching tenons on the apron rails to plug into them. These slots can vary as needed depending on the table you\u2019re working with. For a simple table, you might measure about \u20448 in (1.6 cm) from the edge of each leg, and then another \u20442 in (1.3 cm) to make a mortise of the same size. Remember to fit the leg and apron rails together in order to get an accurate fit. The pieces have to line up so the tenons plug into the mortises once they are cut. Cut mortises in the table legs with a router. The router is a mobile tool you push along wood to cut smooth, consistent shapes. It\u2019s perfect for cutting a mortise in the center of each leg. After marking the cuts you need to make, lower the router and carefully move around the outlines. Note the thickness of the table legs, taking care not to cut more than \u00be of the way through them. Using a router can be dangerous if you\u2019re not careful. Keep a firm grip on it with both hands and keep your fingers up on the safety guards. Move it slowly and shut it off when you\u2019re done. One way to make the cutting process easier is to drill holes at the ends of each mortise outline, then follow up with the router. Doing this can make the router glide a little more smoothly over the wood. Each leg will have a pair of mortises for the apron rails connecting it to adjacent legs. Make sure the mortise cuts look smooth. If you don\u2019t have a router, you could also use a dowel jig to drill holes into each leg and rail. Then, fit wood dowels into the holes. The dowels will allow you to push the pieces together just like with a mortise and tenon design. Trim tenons on each of the apron rails. Use the router to make matching tenons that fit into the mortise slots. Make one on the end of each rail, centering it according to your outline. The tenon sticks out from the rest of the rail, which rests against the uncut portion of each leg. The tenons can be tough to cut to the correct size, so work slowly. Keep them a little bigger if needed, since you can always chip off the excess material later. Fit the apron rails into the legs to make sure they fit. Position the legs near the corners of the tables, aligning the mortises. Then, plug all of the apron rails into them. When they are cut to the right size, the tenons will join perfectly to the mortises. You won\u2019t be able to see the tenons at all. You may need to trim the pieces a little more to get them to fit. If you need to shave them down a little bit, try using a chisel to gradually reduce them. Use wood glue to secure all of the pieces together. Take apart the mortise and tenon joints, then coat them with a layer of wood glue. Use something strong, such as carpenter\u2019s glue, PVA, or epoxy. If you\u2019re not using wood, make sure you choose something compatible with the type of material you\u2019re using. When you\u2019re done, fit the pieces back together and clamp them in place for about 24 hours to dry. Let the pieces dry completely before turning the table back over. Use some effective bar clamps or a similar tool to keep the rails and legs pushed together until the glue solidifies. Another option is to screw the rails and legs together. Getting the screws in the right place is tough, so it can easily make your table uneven. To do it, drill the screws diagonally down through the table legs and into the rails.",
