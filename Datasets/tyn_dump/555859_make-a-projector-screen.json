        "Add the finishing touches.",
        "Although your screen is technically ready to be used you will want to add a few more elements to it.",
        "These last few additions will allow you to easily hang it on a wall and can help make the edges of the screen look clean and professional.",
        "Screw in regular picture hangers evenly along the top horizontal beam of your frame.",
        "You can try adding black artists tape to the edges of your screen to give it a nice stylistic finish.",
        "Adding a dark border can also help improve picture quality by cutting down on light reflection.",
        "Draw your guidelines.",
        "Before you can hang your projector screen you will need to make sure you are hanging it in the right place.",

        "Build the frame.",
        "After you have all of your pieces assembled and your pipes cut to the length you can begin assembling the screen.",
        "Since PVC pipes are standardized, building the screen will require you to simply connect the pieces to one another.",
        "Take a look at the following order of connections to build your frame:\nConnect the two 8'6\u201d pipes to the 6'6\u201d pipes using your 90 degree connectors.",
        "This builds the bottom rectangular base.",
        "Add three T-connecters to the 8'6\u201d pipes.",
        "They should be spaced two feet apart from each other and the corners.",
        "On the back of the base, place the 3'6\u201d pieces of pipes into the T-connectors closest to the corners.",
        "Put ninety degree elbows on these 3'6\u201d pipes and then add the 1'6\u201d piece out of them.",
        "Add a 45 degree elbow on the end of that pipe.",

        "Add a ninety degree elbow to each end.",
