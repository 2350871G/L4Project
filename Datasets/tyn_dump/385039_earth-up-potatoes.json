This will ensure enough foliage is left to allow the plant to carry on growing strongly, but will starve the developing tubers of light so that they are prevented from turning green and poisonous. Whilst doing this, take the opportunity to remove any weeds or debris that have returned since planting."

As the plant continues to grow, repeat the process every time it reaches 10-15cm (4-6 inches) of new growth above ground. This could mean repeating the process 3 or 4 times per season."
