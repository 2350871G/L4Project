Use a shovel to manually remove the top 1\u20133 inches (2.5\u20137.6 cm) of sod wherever you intend to level. Alternatively, you can slice the turf into 1 ft (0.30 m) x 2 ft (0.61 m) strips using an edger or sharp spade, then loosen each strip with your shovel. Dampening the grass on your leveling site with a hose may make it easier to pry up in neat, intact sections. There\u2019s no need to remove your sod by hand if you\u2019re going to be breaking up your soil with a tiller. One of the many advantages of this tool is that the spinning blades automatically turn living plant matter like grass into mulch.

        "If one of your strings sags, it may throw off your readings once you attach a level.",
        "Nylon is much stronger than other common string materials like cotton or jute, which makes it less likely to sag or break.",
        "Attach a string line level to the center of your first section of string.",
        "A string line level is a type of spirit level designed to be fitted horizontally onto a marking string.",
        "Simply align the slots on either side of the level with the string and snap it into place.",
        "Be careful not to tug on the string as you set up your level, or you could accidentally pull your stakes out of alignment.",
        "A good level line will only run you around $2-3, and is a handy tool to have around for a variety of projects.",
        "Adjust each section of string so that it\u2019s perfectly level.",
        "Once you\u2019ve got the level in position, slide the ends of the string up or down until the bubble rests directly in the center of the transparent chamber.",
        "Then, remove the level, attach it to the next section, and make any necessary adjustments.",
        "When you\u2019re finished, the strings should form a perfectly level plane over the surface of your lawn.",
        "To make more precise micro adjustments when lowering the string, try tapping the stake on the higher side deeper into the ground instead of going to the trouble of moving the string itself.",
        "Establishing a level with your string first will give you a helpful visual reference that you can check while adding or reshaping the dirt at your work site.",
        "Redistributing Your Soil Till the area inside your level-grade line or fill it with transplanted soil.",
        "If you\u2019re using a motorized tiller, go over the exposed dirt a few times, churning it up enough to allow you to spread it easily.",
        "If you\u2019ve opted to bring in soil from an outside source, you'll need to dump it into your leveling site in multiple wheelbarrow loads or shovelfuls.",
        "If you plan on cultivating the ground you\u2019re leveling, consider mixing your soil with 1 part compost and 2 parts sand to introduce beneficial nutrients and make it less vulnerable to compaction.",
        "To level the ground around smaller holes, depressions, and ditches, disperse your soil equally over each of the spots you want to fill, leaving the surrounding surface uncovered.",
        "Spread the soil until it\u2019s roughly even with your level-grade line.",
        "Use a shovel, landscaping rake, or flat spade to gradually redistribute the soil from higher areas to lower areas until your entire site has a uniform appearance.",
        "As you work, keep an eye on your string lines for reference.",
        "Measure noticeably high or low patches along your level-grade line with a tape measure to get a better idea of how much soil you\u2019ll need to displace.",
        "This step is simple but time-consuming, so be patient and focus on getting every part of the soil as flat and smooth as possible.",
        "To deal with large areas more systematically, draw out your leveling site as a grid, using the stakes you put down earlier to represent the criss-crossing lines.",
        "Measure and mark high and low spots within the squares based on how much soil they need to gain or lose.",
        "Check the level of your work site with a scrap board and a carpenter's level.",
        "Lay the board down flat near the center of the site and set the level on top.",
        "If the bubble is poised directly between the indicator lines, the ground is perfectly level.",
        "Otherwise, continue spreading and smoothing until it is.",
        "Be sure to check the level in multiple spots to confirm that it's the same all around.",
        "If the bubble is higher on one side of the level, it means that the terrain slopes downward in the opposite direction.",
        "Using a board as a buffer will give your level a flatter surface to rest on than the soil itself, which will naturally be a little inconsistent.",
        "Tamp down the newly-spread soil to prevent it from shifting.",
        "Go over your work area 2-3 times with a water-filled roller or hand tamper to gently compact the soil.",
        "If you\u2019re spot-leveling small patches, walking over the reshaped terrain will also do the trick.",
        "Just be careful not to disturb the surface of the soil with your feet.",
        "Ask about renting a roller or another tamping tool of choice when you go in to reserve your motorized tiller.",
        "Water the area lightly to help the dirt settle.",
        "Use a gardening hose or watering can to moisten the dirt between your string lines.",
        "This will encourage it to stick together and speed up compaction and solidification.",
        "Add enough water to darken the soil, but watch out for streaming or standing water.",
        "Oversaturating the soil could result in runoff, uneven drying, or other issues that could end up undoing all your hard work.",
        "Repeat the process if necessary to build up the soil to your leveling line.",
        "After raking, tamping, and watering, you may discover that the surface of your soil has dropped below the string.",
        "If this happens, you\u2019ll need to run through the same steps using smaller amounts of soil until you make up the difference.",
        "When you\u2019re done, pull up your stakes and move on to the next phase of your project.",
        "If you plan on replacing the strips of sod you dug up earlier, make sure the dirt remains 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) below the bordering grass.",
        "Otherwise, the grass will end up being too high in the area you just leveled.",
        "You can also top off the soil with a thick layer of sand or decomposed stone if it will be supporting a weight-bearing structure, such as a deck, patio, or raised flower bed.Tip: Starting with a little more soil than you think you realistically need can keep you from having to haul in another load later on."
