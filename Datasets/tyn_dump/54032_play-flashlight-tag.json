        "You can also play indoors with the lights off.",
        "This works best in a big, open room, like a furnished basement without too much furniture.",
        "Be careful playing around heavy furniture or household items that could break.",
        "Gather a group of people and some flashlights.",
        "Team flashlight tag is best played with a lot of people.",
        "If you have ten or more people who want to play, team flashlight might be more fun than playing with only one 'it' person.",
        "With team flashlight, half of the people playing are 'it' at the same time, so be sure to have enough flashlights for half of your friends.",
        "Be sure to have extra batteries handy so that if someone's flashlight stops working mid-game, they can replace their batteries quickly.",
        "You may also want to set a rule to employ if batteries do run out.",
        "For instance, if someone's batteries do run out, they would have 30 seconds or one minute to \u201cpause\u201d and replace their batteries before rejoining the game.",
        "During this \u201cpause,\u201d they could not be tagged 'out.'",
        "Pick teams.",
        "Be sure to split the group into two even halves, with approximately the same number of people on each team.",
        "Determine a location for the \u201cjail.\u201d The size of your \u201cjail\u201d will depend on how many people you have on each team.",
        "Your \u201cjail\u201d should be large enough for everyone from one team to fit comfortably.",
        "You can outline the \u201cjail\u201d with sidewalk chalk if you don't have a clearly defined area to use as the \u201cjail.\u201d Be as specific about the parameters of the \u201cjail\u201d as possible, since people can be tagged out of \u201cjail\u201d by another member of their team.",
        "Choose one team to be 'it.'",
        "The easiest way to decide which team is 'it' would be to flip a coin.",
        "You could also choose a representative from each team to play rock-paper-scissors.",
        "Once a person goes to \u201cjail,\u201d they can be tagged back into the game by one of their team members.",
        "Thus, the 'it' team will need to guard the \u201cjail.\u201d Choose one or two people to act as guards during the game.",
        "Hide!",
        "Allow one minute for the team who is not 'it' to run and hide.",
        "During this time, the 'it' team must remain in \u201cjail\u201d with their eyes closed.",
        "After the minute is up, the 'it' team can leave jail and begin tagging members of the other team.",
        "Tag members of the other team until no one else is left.",
        "To tag someone, a person should sneak up on a member of the other team and shine the flashlight on them.",
        "This person is then out and must go to \u201cjail.\u201d\nMake sure to quickly shine the light on the person you want to tag and then turn it off immediately.",
        "Otherwise, another person hiding in the area might see you and run away.",
        "During this time, members of the not-'it' team should try to rescue the team members in \u201cjail.\u201d You can do so by tagging their hand, at which point they are back in the game.",
        "Continue until all of the members of the not-'it' team are in \u201cjail.\u201d A game of team flash light ends when everyone from the not-'it' team is caught and put in jail.",
        "However, if a game is taking too long, you can always agree that, after a certain point, the 'it'-team loses.",
        "For example, give the 'it'-team an hour to locate all the players before they lose.",
        "After a complete team has been tagged 'out,' you can restart a new round.",
        "The not-'it' team from the last round will now be the 'it' team.",
        "Taking Precautions Keep the field of play away from the campfire and tents.",
        "If you're playing flashlight tag while camping, make sure to keep the field of play safe.",
        "Do not play too close to the campfire and tents.",
        "You do not want to risk getting burnt by the fire, or accidentally knocking down a tent late at night.",
        "Use dim flashlights and avoid laser pointers.",
        "You should play flashlight tag with somewhat dim flashlights.",
        "You do not want to be shining bright lights into other player's eyes, as this can cause eye irritation.",
        "Never use laser pointers to play flashlight tag.",
        "Laser pointers can be extremely harmful to eyesight and even cause temporary blindness.",
        "This puts players at risk for falling and getting hurt.",
        "Keep your playing area small.",
        "If you're playing flashlight tag, try to keep the play area small.",
        "For one, this can make the game more fun.",
        "If you're playing in an open area, like the woods, it can be nearly impossible to find everyone with unlimited access to hiding spots.",
        "Also, playing in a small area is good for safety.",
        "You do not want any players getting lost.",
        "Keep track of all players, if you're the adult.",
        "If you're an adult supervising a game of flashlight tag, make sure you keep track of all the players.",
        "You do not want any kids to get lost or injured during a game.",
        "Do a quick role call before and after a game of flashlight tag to make sure everyone's accounted for."
