When you adjust the focus knob, a lens on the enlarger will move up or down, changing the focus. If the image gets blurrier when you adjust the focus, turn the knob in the opposite direction. Set the aperture on the enlarger to f/8 for most photographs. The aperture setting determines how wide the lens opening on the enlarger is.

The right aperture setting can vary depending on the image you\u2019re printing, but generally, f/8 is a good place to start. Testing the Exposure Cut a strip of photo paper to test the exposure with. Before you print onto a full-size sheet of photo paper, you\u2019ll need to test several exposure times on a strip of photo paper to see which time is best for your image. Cut a strip that\u2019s wide enough to capture a detailed portion of the image. The size of the strip doesn\u2019t need to be precise. You\u2019ll need to use actual photo paper to test the exposure since you\u2019ll be developing it.Warning: Don\u2019t turn on the lights to cut your photo paper or the strip will be ruined. Place the strip of paper on the projection plane. Open up the top of the frame, and place the strip inside of it. Then, close the frame. Position the strip so it will capture a detailed portion of the image, which will make it easier to determine which exposure time is best. Expose the entire strip of paper to light for 2 seconds. First, use the dial on the timer to set the exposure time to 2 seconds. Then, press the \u201cstart\u201d button on the timer to turn on the light bulb inside the enlarger. After 2 seconds, the light should turn off. Cover one-fifth of the strip, and expose the rest of it for another 2 seconds. Use a piece of thick scrap paper to cover up the end of the strip. That way, that portion of the strip won\u2019t be exposed to any more light, and you\u2019ll be able to see what 2 seconds of light exposure looks like once you develop it. After you cover one-fifth of the strip, set the timer to 2 seconds, and press the start button. At this point, the rest of the strip will have been exposed to light for 4 seconds. Repeat until you\u2019ve exposed 5 sections to different durations of light. For each additional section, increase the exposure time. Use the following schedule for the remaining 3 sections:\nCover two-fifths of the strip and expose it to 4 seconds of light. Cover three-fifths of the strip and expose it to 8 seconds of light.

Then, transfer it to a stop bath for 30 seconds, stirring it continuously. Next, submerge the paper in a fix bath for 30 seconds. Finally, rinse it with water for 1-2 minutes. When you\u2019re finished developing the image, you can turn the lights back on. Use the test strip to determine the best exposure time for your final print. Your developed image should be divided into 5 distinct sections. Choose the section that looks the best (not too bright and not too dark), and write down the exposure time for that section so you can use it for your final print. The exposure times for the different sections are:\nFirst section: 2 seconds. Second section: 4 seconds. Third section: 8 seconds. Fourth section: 16 seconds. Fifth section: 28 seconds. Make a more specific test strip if none of the exposures look quite right (optional). The test strip is a good way to narrow down what exposure time might be best for your image. However, if none of the strip colors are what you want, try making another test strip with exposure times in closer increments.

Enlarging and Developing Your Final Print Turn the lights off again. Do this before you remove the photo paper for your final print so it\u2019s not ruined by the light. If it\u2019s not still on, turn the red safety light on so you can see what you\u2019re doing. Place a full sheet of photo paper on the projection plane. Lift up the top of the frame, insert the paper, and close the frame. Then, place the projection plane on the base of the enlarger. Expose the paper to light using your desired exposure time. Set the exposure time on the timer using the dial. Then, make sure the projected image is lined up with the photo paper, and press the start button on the timer. For example, if you liked the image quality for 16 seconds of exposure time on the test strip, you\u2019d set the timer to 16 seconds. Develop your final print.

        "The right aperture setting can vary depending on the image you\u2019re printing, but generally, f/8 is a good place to start.",
        "Testing the Exposure Cut a strip of photo paper to test the exposure with.",
        "Before you print onto a full-size sheet of photo paper, you\u2019ll need to test several exposure times on a strip of photo paper to see which time is best for your image.",
        "Cut a strip that\u2019s wide enough to capture a detailed portion of the image.",
        "The size of the strip doesn\u2019t need to be precise.",
        "You\u2019ll need to use actual photo paper to test the exposure since you\u2019ll be developing it.Warning: Don\u2019t turn on the lights to cut your photo paper or the strip will be ruined.",
        "Place the strip of paper on the projection plane.",
        "Open up the top of the frame, and place the strip inside of it.",
        "Then, close the frame.",
        "Position the strip so it will capture a detailed portion of the image, which will make it easier to determine which exposure time is best.",
        "Expose the entire strip of paper to light for 2 seconds.",
        "First, use the dial on the timer to set the exposure time to 2 seconds.",
        "Then, press the \u201cstart\u201d button on the timer to turn on the light bulb inside the enlarger.",
        "After 2 seconds, the light should turn off.",
        "Cover one-fifth of the strip, and expose the rest of it for another 2 seconds.",
        "Use a piece of thick scrap paper to cover up the end of the strip.",
        "That way, that portion of the strip won\u2019t be exposed to any more light, and you\u2019ll be able to see what 2 seconds of light exposure looks like once you develop it.",
        "After you cover one-fifth of the strip, set the timer to 2 seconds, and press the start button.",
        "At this point, the rest of the strip will have been exposed to light for 4 seconds.",
        "Repeat until you\u2019ve exposed 5 sections to different durations of light.",
        "For each additional section, increase the exposure time.",
        "Use the following schedule for the remaining 3 sections:\nCover two-fifths of the strip and expose it to 4 seconds of light.",
        "Cover three-fifths of the strip and expose it to 8 seconds of light.",
        "Cover four-fifths of the strip and expose it to 12 seconds of light.",
        "Develop the test strip.",
        "Dip the strip of paper in a development bath for 60 seconds.",
        "Then, transfer it to a stop bath for 30 seconds, stirring it continuously.",
        "Next, submerge the paper in a fix bath for 30 seconds.",
        "Finally, rinse it with water for 1-2 minutes.",
        "When you\u2019re finished developing the image, you can turn the lights back on.",
        "Use the test strip to determine the best exposure time for your final print.",
        "Your developed image should be divided into 5 distinct sections.",
        "Choose the section that looks the best (not too bright and not too dark), and write down the exposure time for that section so you can use it for your final print.",
        "The exposure times for the different sections are:\nFirst section: 2 seconds.",
        "Second section: 4 seconds.",
        "Third section: 8 seconds.",
        "Fourth section: 16 seconds.",
        "Fifth section: 28 seconds.",
        "Make a more specific test strip if none of the exposures look quite right (optional).",
        "The test strip is a good way to narrow down what exposure time might be best for your image.",
        "However, if none of the strip colors are what you want, try making another test strip with exposure times in closer increments.",
        "For example, if 8 seconds is too bright and 16 seconds is too dark, try making a test strip with five sections between 8 and 16 seconds.",
        "To do this, expose the whole paper for 8 seconds, then expose each of the next 4 sections for 2 seconds.",
        "Your new test strip will then display exposures of 8 seconds, 10 seconds, 12 seconds, 14 seconds, and 16 seconds.",
        "Depending on the image, you may want to try 5-second intervals instead.",
        "Enlarging and Developing Your Final Print Turn the lights off again.",
        "Do this before you remove the photo paper for your final print so it\u2019s not ruined by the light.",
        "If it\u2019s not still on, turn the red safety light on so you can see what you\u2019re doing.",
        "Place a full sheet of photo paper on the projection plane.",
        "Lift up the top of the frame, insert the paper, and close the frame.",
        "Then, place the projection plane on the base of the enlarger.",
        "Expose the paper to light using your desired exposure time.",
        "Set the exposure time on the timer using the dial.",
        "Then, make sure the projected image is lined up with the photo paper, and press the start button on the timer.",
        "For example, if you liked the image quality for 16 seconds of exposure time on the test strip, you\u2019d set the timer to 16 seconds.",
        "Develop your final print.",
        "Repeat the developing process that you used for the test strip.",
        "Start with the development bath for 60 seconds, then dip the paper in the stop bath for 30 seconds.",
        "Finally, transfer the paper to the fix bath for 30 seconds before rinsing it off with water.",
        "When you\u2019re finished developing your final print, hang it up to dry in the darkroom."
