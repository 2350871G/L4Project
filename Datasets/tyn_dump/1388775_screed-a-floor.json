This protects your floor from moisture in the subfloor, and from settling and other issues in the main structure. However, unbonded screed is more likely to curl. Reinforcing can help with this problem, as described below. Due to the risk of curling, an unbonded screed should be at least 50mm (2\") thick at all points. This means pouring a layer at least 70mm (2.75\") thick to allow for variations on the sublayer."

        "Push the straightedge across the surface of the screed in a side-to-side sawing motion.",
        "Tilt the lumber slightly so the corner forms a cutting edge to make the screed level.",
        "Repeat until the floor is complete.",
        "Trowel on, compact, and level the screed in stages until the first section is filled, then move on to the next.",
        "Once you have two sections filled, remove the batten between them and fill in the gap.",
        "Continue until you have screeded the whole floor.",
        "If you cannot screed the floor in one day, install day joints at the edge of the screed.",
        "Finish the concrete.",
        "It's a good idea to bull float the screed right away to remove imperfections.",
        "Float a second time once the concrete has stopped bleeding and excess water has evaporated (or after you have removed it).",
        "For final finishing instructions, refer to your flooring manufacturer or use these suggestions:\nTo create a textured finish, swirl a wood float in an arced motion across the surface.",
        "This works well under ceramic tiles and carpets.",
        "For a smooth finish, use the same motion with a steel trowel instead, held flat against the surface.",
        "This works well under vinyl tiles.",
        "Cure the screed.",
        "One way to cure the screed is to place it under polyethylene sheeting, sealed at the edges.",
        "Leave the screed undisturbed for at least 7 days, or longer if average temperatures fall below 10\u00baC (50\u00baF) in a 24 hour period.",
        "Wait for the floor to dry.",
        "Even after curing, your screed will need time to dry.",
        "Avoid vehicle traffic and do not install floor for at least three weeks.",
        "As a rough rule of thumb, the screed takes one day to dry for each mm (0.04\") of depth.",
        "If you are bonding ceramic or stone tiles, terrazzo, or synthetic resin floor to the screed, cut stress relief joints every 5\u20136 meters (16.4\u201319.7 ft), in straight vertical lines halfway through the screed.",
        "You can do this with a trowel now, but it may be easier to align with the tiles if you wait until the screed hardens and cut joints with a saw (within 3\u20134 weeks)."
