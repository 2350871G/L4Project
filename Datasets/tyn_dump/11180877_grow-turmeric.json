Your rhizomes are going to need to be watered regularly, especially if you live in a warmer climate where the water is likely to evaporate very quickly. Check on your turmeric once every couple of days to see if the soil is damp. If it\u2019s still a little moist, you can wait another day before checking. Water your rhizomes with tap water until the soil at the top is visibly dampTip: If it\u2019s cold outside or your soil is still wet when you go to water it, you do not need to water your turmeric immediately. If you\u2019d like to keep the humidity level up though, fell free to mist it with a spray bottle. Wait 6-10 months for your turmeric to grow. Your turmeric will begin to sprout after 6-10 months of watering in a warm climate. Once you see a stalk start to stick out of the planter or pot, it has started to grow into a mature plant. Leave your turmeric plants where they are until the stalks grow to 4\u20138 inches (10\u201320 cm) in length. Transferring Your Stalks Outdoors Transfer your stalks to their final pot once the stalks are 4\u20138 in (10\u201320 cm) long. Once your stalks have emerged, you need to transfer them to a bigger pot or section of your garden where they can be exposed to sunlight. To transfer a plant, pour soil halfway into your new pot. Dig your hands into your turmeric pot\u2019s soil around the root to find the rhizome. Carefully lift it out of the soil, moving topsoil out of the way by hand as needed. Space plants in the same planter or planter\u2019s box at least 1.5 feet (0.46 m) apart from one another.Tip: Any pot that\u2019s at least twice the size of your original container should provide more than enough space for your plant. Use the same soil that you used to originally plant your rhizome. If you\u2019re growing your turmeric in your garden, you don\u2019t need to transfer your plant. If you\u2019re moving the plants into a planter\u2019s box, dig your hole so that the plant has at least 1.5 feet (0.46 m) of space around it in every direction. Move your plants to partial shade once they\u2019re in a bigger pot or planter. Find a place with partial shade to keep your leaves from getting burnt as it adjusts to the sunlight. Once you\u2019ve transferred your plants into a bigger container, move them outdoors so that they can be exposed to sunlight and continue growing. Turmeric doesn\u2019t need a ton of light to stay healthy, and keeping it in partial shade for at least part of the day will ensure that the leaves don\u2019t dry out quickly. You\u2019ll have to store your turmeric indoors near a window if it\u2019s still colder than 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C) outside. Water your outdoor plants every 2-3 days. Moving the plants outdoors is essential once the leaves have grown, as the plant will need sunlight to grow. Continue to water the plant as you normally did when it was indoors to keep your plant from drying out. If the plant doesn\u2019t get enough water, it will start to die. Use the mist setting on your garden hose to water your plant to avoid damaging the leaves. Look out for damage or discoloration in your plant. If you find lots of physical damage to your leaves, it could be a sign that you have a thrips infestation or a caterpillar feeding on your plant. Use an organic pesticide like neem oil or a nontoxic soil treatment to ward off unwanted bugs. When you remove or inspect a rhizome, if it looks gray or pale, it could be a sign of scale damage. Throw your rhizome out to prevent the infestation from spreading and then treat your soil with dimethoate. Turmeric plants are often unappealing to many insects in temperate regions of the world. Turmeric powder can even be used as a pesticide with some crops! Harvesting Your Plant Harvest your turmeric when the leaves and stem start to brown and dry. At some point in the next 2-3 months, the turmeric plant will begin to brown and dry out. This is the best time to harvest your turmeric. If you continue to let the plant grow, it will slowly rot over time and ruin any potential turmeric that you could extract. You can tell if your turmeric is almost ready for harvesting if it seems like it\u2019s struggling to retain water and dries out quickly. Cut the stems of your plant 1\u20133 inches (2.5\u20137.6 cm) from the soil. To harvest the turmeric, you need to access the adult rhizomes underneath the soil. To start, use garden shears or a cutting knife to remove the stalks near the soil. Discard the leaves by composting them. If the plant is dry enough, you should be able to simply snap the stalk near the bottom. Remove the rhizome and wash it in the sink. Once you\u2019ve cut the stem, pull the remainder of the plant out of the soil by hand. Cut or snap off the remaining sections of stalk and take the mature rhizome to a sink to wash it. Run it under warm water and rub it softly by hand to remove the dirt and soil off of the rhizome. Don\u2019t forcibly scrub the rhizome. You just need to remove the outer layers of dirt and soil before grinding, using, or storing it. Store any matured rhizomes in the refrigerator if you don\u2019t plan on using them. Place any rhizomes that you don\u2019t plan on using in an airtight plastic bag or storage container. You can store them in the fridge for up to 6 months without inflicting any damage on the flavor of the turmeric.Tip:You can replant rhizomes after they\u2019ve been stored in your fridge if you\u2019d like. As long as the rhizome hasn\u2019t been boiled or cooked, you\u2019ll be able to replant it using the same process that you used before. Boil and peel a rhizome to prepare it for grinding. To prepare a rhizome for grinding, boil a clean rhizome in a pot with water. Once the water reaches a rolling boil, turn it down to a simmer. After 45-60 minutes, drain the pot in a colander or strainer. You can rub the skin off of the rhizome after boiling it, although it\u2019s perfectly fine to leave it on. You can tell if the rhizome is ready for grinding if a fork easily pierces it after boiling. Grind your rhizome to make turmeric powder. Let your rhizome dry out in the sun overnight. Put on some rubber gloves before making turmeric powder, since the orange powder that you\u2019re creating won\u2019t easily wash off of the skin. Cut your rhizome into smaller pieces and then grind it with a spice mill, grinder, or with a mortar and pestle until you\u2019ve got a fine powder. You can use a food dehydrator set to 140 \u00b0F (60 \u00b0C) to dry your rhizome more quickly if you\u2019d like. It\u2019s ready to cut and grind once it\u2019s brittle and dry. This process usually takes 30-45 minutes. Store turmeric powder in an airtight container designed for food storage for future use.",
