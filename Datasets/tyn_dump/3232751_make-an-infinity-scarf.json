Use matching thread and keep the stitching as invisible as possible; some people recommend twisting the ends before stitching to help when looping the scarf around your neck; you may wish to experiment.

Crocheting an Infinity Scarf Use a 9mm crochet hook (size N or 15 US; 00 UK). Choose chunky but easily worked yarn, 1 ball/skein. Row 1: Chain 100. Join up the chain in the round using slip stitch. When doing these, keep the chain untwisted. Row 2: Chain 1, single crochet 100.  Rows 3 to 10: Repeat Row 2.  Fasten off the end. Weave in the ends to complete. The round will be completed and you'll have an infinity scarf to wear. Transforming by Knotting Find a long winter scarf or other scarf. (must have two ends) Tie the ends of the scarf together in a flat knot.  Loop scarf over your head twice.  Arrange scarf carefully so the knot is hidden.  Tuck in the ends of the knot. An easy infinity scarf is now yours to wear.",
