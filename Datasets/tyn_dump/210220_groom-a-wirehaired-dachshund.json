However, if your dog is too nervous to stand on a higher surface, you can brush it on the floor. Lay down an old towel or newspaper to catch any fallen hair. A grooming table is a good investment if you groom your dachshund regularly for shows. You can secure your dog to a grooming table with the attached collar and loop, which helps if your dog likes to move around. Never leave your dog unattended on a counter or table. The dog could get seriously injured if it fell."
