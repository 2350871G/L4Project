Make sure that the photo isn't wet -- dry it off with a clean towel right away too. Check the photo to see if it\u2019s flexible. When you're done looking for condensation, feel the photograph to see if it's become softer and more pliable. If it\u2019s still not flexible enough to uncurl, put it back on the rack.

You can usually find archival blotting paper at art supply stores. The piece of blotting paper should be large enough to rest the photo.

Place the photo on a clean surface and cover it with a piece of paper. Add a heavy item such as a brick on top, and let it sit for a few days. Place the photo between the pages of a heavy book. Open the book to the middle, and set the photo between the pages. Let the photo sit in the book for a day or two so it has to time to smooth out. To make the process faster, you can place a heavy item such as a brick on top of the book. Run an iron over the photo\u2019s edges for a few seconds. If weight doesn\u2019t seem to be helping to uncurl the photo, place the photo picture-side down on an ironing board with a thin towel over it.
