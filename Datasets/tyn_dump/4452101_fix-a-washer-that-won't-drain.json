The new pump should line up exactly with the existing screw holes in your washing machine. If it doesn\u2019t, check that you got the right pump for your washing machine. Reattach the drain hose to the new pump. Insert the end of the grey drain hose into the port on the pump. Make sure that it\u2019s attached securely so that it won\u2019t leak while the machine is running. Some pumps attach to an additional pipe. If your machine has a second pipe, attach it to the second port on your pump. Attach the pump belt to the new pump. The pump belt is under the washing machine and is attached to the motor. Lift your machine to access the belt and wrap it around the new pump. This will make the pump operate so it can drain the water. Test your pump by turning on your washing machine.",
