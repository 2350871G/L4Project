        "Tap the anchor into the hole you drilled.",
        "If possible, just use the pressure of your hand.",
        "If the anchor won't go in that way, gently tap it with a light hammer until it is flush with the wall.",
        "Be very careful, however.",
        "Plaster is brittle and can crumble if you accidentally hit it with the hammer.",
        "If you do end up with a crack or small hole in your wall, you may be able to repair it with a plaster compound repair kit.",
        "Look for one at a hardware store.",
        "Basically, you will need to carefully smear the compound into the damaged area, smooth it out, and let it set.",
        "Expert Answer\t\t\t\t\t\tQ\t\t\t\tWhen asked, \"How does a drywall anchor work?\"",
        "Jeff Huynh\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGeneral Manager, Handyman Rescue Team\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJeff Huynh is the General Manager of Handyman Rescue Team, a full service solution in home services, renovations, and repair in the Greater Seattle area.",
        "He has over five years of handyman experience.",
        "He has a BS in Business Administration from the San Francisco State University and his Certificate in Industrial Electronics Technology from North Seattle College.",
        "EXPERT ADVICE\t\t\t\tJeff Huynh, the general manager of Handyman Rescue Team, answered: \"The anchor expands when you place it in a hole in the drywall.",
        "That friction creates holding force once the screen is installed, provided there's enough support behind the wall.\"",
        "Drive the screw into the anchor.",
        "This should be fairly easy, but you can use the drill with a screw attachment to do it quickly.",
        "Don't drive the screw all the way in.",
        "Leave a small distance between the screw head and the surface of the wall.",
        "Attach the hanger on the back of the object to the screw on the wall.",
        "Or, if you prefer, you can wrap one end of a piece of wire tightly around the screw head, then attach the other to the object's hanger.",
        "Check the placement of your object with a level to make sure it's even.",
        "Installing Multiple Hangers Insert more screws, if necessary.",
        "If the object is large or very heavy, put another screw in the wall to the side of the first one, using the same procedure.",
        "This will help distribute the weight of the object and keep it more secure on the wall.",
        "If possible, drive the second screw into a stud.",
        "Move the stud finder about 16 inches (41 cm) to the side of the first screw and try to locate another stud.",
        "This is the standard distance between studs, but it can vary widely.",
        "Before you drill the second screw's anchor hole, place a level on the line between the first screw and the spot where you want the second one to be.",
        "Raise or lower the second screw's spot to make things even.",
        "Have someone help you with the hanging if the object is very heavy or cumbersome.",
        "Map out the screw locations if you are hanging multiple objects.",
        "If you want to hang several objects at the same height, start with the location of the first screw.",
        "Figure out the distance you want there to be between the middle of one object and the middle of one next to it.",
        "Using your measuring tape and a pencil, mark out that distance to the right or left of the first screw.",
        "If you want the objects to sit at the same height, put a level on the line you measured out to ensure the screws are even with each other.",
        "If you want the objects to sit at different heights, measure up or down from the second mark.",
        "For instance, if you want the second object to sit 4 inches (10 cm) higher and 18 inches (46 cm) to the right of the first one, measure out 18 inches (46 cm) to the right of the first screw.",
        "Then measure 4 inches (10 cm) up from there and put the second screw in.",
        "Keep measuring, leveling, and installing screws until you have them all in position.",
        "Hang shelving.",
        "Most shelves consist of a set of anchors (usually 2-3) that hold up the shelving material.",
        "These anchors usually require at least 2 screws apiece.",
        "Measure the height you want the shelf to be, and pre-drill one hole there.",
        "Set the anchor in place, then drive a screw in.",
        "Predrill a hole for the second (and third, if necessary), and install that screw.",
        "To install the additional anchors, measure out the required distance right or left of the first one (depending on where you want the shelf to sit).",
        "Set a level on the line made by your tape measure to make sure the second anchor will be even with the first.",
        "Install the screws as you did for the first anchor.",
        "Follow the instructions that came with your shelving to determine the required distance between your anchors."
