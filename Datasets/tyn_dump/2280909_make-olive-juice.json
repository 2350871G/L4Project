            "description": "Cured olives work best because they are relatively easy to come by and can be preserved longer than fresh olives. Water-cured olives can be used if you want a fresher flavor, but these olives tend to be considerably bitterer and do not last quite as long as brine-cured olives. You could use fresh olives during harvest season, which falls out around late September through mid November, but fresh olives have a very bitter taste that may make the juice less palatable. Dried olives should be avoided, since they do not contain enough juice to extract. Use whole or pitted olives. Avoid olives that are stuffed with other ingredients."

Even though you will end up placing the olives in a salty, brine-like solution later on, it is important that you wash off any old brine to avoid contaminating the solution you use with additional salt."

Crushing the olives beforehand may release too much of the juice too early, causing you to lose it. If you do not pierce the olives, however, the juice may struggle to break through the skin and reach the liquid."
