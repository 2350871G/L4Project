If there isn't a front of back, then check the hems; make sure that the folded-under side of the hem is facing you. This method will create a skinny, elegant wrap with straight ends. The napkin needs to be about 3 times the height of your knife. Fold the bottom edge up by 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm). The measurements don't have to be exact; they are there simply to create a pocket for your silverware. The napkin should now be twice the height of your silverware. This will create a soft of pocket for your silverware to slip into. Make sure that the pocket is the same width from left to right. The side edges need to match up. Tuck stacked silverware behind the fold, on the right side of the napkin. Make sure that your silverware is  oriented vertically, so that it is sticking out from behind the napkin's pocket. Stack your silverware starting with the knife. Add the forks next, starting with the larger one and finishing with the smaller. Fold the top edge so that the napkin is the same height as the knife. Make sure that the bottom edge of your stacked silverware is nestled inside the napkin's pocket. Next, grab the top edge, and fold it down over the silverware. Like with the pocket, make sure that the top edge is nice, neat, and straight. Adjust the folds so that the top edge touches the bottom fold. Napkins and silverware come in different sizes, so what works for one size may not work for another. The top edge of your napkin should be touching the bottom, folded edge of the napkin. If it doesn't, adjust the width of the pocket until it does. For example:\nIf the top edge doesn't touch the bottom edge, the bottom edge is too wide. Make it narrower, then fold the top edge back down. If the top edge extends past the bottom edge, the bottom edge is too narrow. Fold it up more, then pull the top edge back down. Roll the napkin tightly, starting from the right side. Take the right side of the napkin, and flip it over towards the right. Make sure that the silverware is tucked into the fold, then begin to roll it tightly towards the left side. Be sure to smooth out any ripples or wrinkles as you roll. Make sure that the top and bottom folded edges don't shift or move. Add a napkin ring or ribbon, if desired.

If you don't want to secure the bundle with anything, set it seam-side-down on top of the table. Folding a Pointed Pouch Orient a square napkin like a diamond. If the napkin has both a front and back side, make sure that the back is facing up. This method will give you a flat, house-shaped pouch. If you want to make a non-pointed pouch, orient the napkin like a square, with one of the straight edges facing you. Use a napkin that is about twice the height of your knife. Center your silverware on top of the napkin so that it's touching the top corner. Do not stack the silverware. Instead, place the fork, knife, and spoon side-by-side on top of the napkin. Make sure that they are centered, oriented vertically, and touching the top corner. For a square pouch, have the silverware touch the top, straight edge instead. You should have an equal amount of fabric to the left and right sides of the aligned silverware. Fold the bottom corner of the napkin over the silverware. How many inches or centimeters you fold it up by depends on the length of the silverware. The bottom edge of the silverware should be nestled right inside the fold.
