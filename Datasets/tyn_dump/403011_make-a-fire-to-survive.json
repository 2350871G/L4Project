Using wet or live materials for fire starting will result in more smoke than fire, so leaves should be avoided at all costs. To test whether the wood is good for fire or not, make sure that when you break the wood, it breaks cleanly. If the wood bends, it is not good for burning. Clear the ground in a large circle where your fire will be. The circle should be at least a 2 meter (6.6 ft) circle away from trees. Place rocks in a small circle in the center to make the fire ring. They should be big rocks, about 2-4 times larger than your fist. These will prevent the fire from spreading. When you make an outdoor fire, rocks should always be placed around it. Place a large bed of tinder in the center ready to take an ember.  Put a small amount of kindling in order to retain the flame once tinder is lit.  Creating an Ember Find a plank shaped piece of wood.  Carve a dime sized bowl near the edge of the plank.  Cut a V shaped notch from the bowl to the edge of the plank.  Find a very long rod shaped branch with an end compatible to your bowl and notch on the plank, this will be your spindle.  Place your best tinder under the notch, this is where the ember will form.  Place the end of the spindle in the notch.  Spin the spindle using a back and forth motion between both hands.  Continue until an ember is seen (30+ minutes straight is not uncommon). Once smoke is seen you must continue vigorously until an ember is seen in the tinder. This is the around the point of exhaustion, but you must not stop otherwise you might have to start again. Using the Bow and Handle Method Collect the equipment you will need for the Bow Drill: A short spindle should be used due to the downward pressure that will be applied, so that it does not bend or break. A top handle that has another bowl carved out of it will be held in your left hand for stability. A bow with the string wrapped once around the spindle will be used to do the back and forth motions. A string. A boot's shoelace works very well for this application, due to the standard sizes being very long. Set up the Bow Drill. The setup should not differ very much from the one in  this image. Wrap the string around the spindle once. Tie the ends of the shoelace to the ends of the bow. Place the spindle on the piece of wood which you will make the ember on, and place a piece of small wood on top of the spindle for stabilization. Move the bow back and forth while pushing downward on the spindle to create friction and make an ember.  Starting a Fire Blow on the ember in the tinder cluster until it catches fire, this may take several minutes. It will smoke more and more until it catches fire. Make sure not to blow too hard though, you don't want to have to make another one. Place the tinder cluster in the fire circle to light the tinder and kindling previously arranged.  Continue to add kindling until it burns easily.  Slowly add fuel wood until it burns easily. At this point the fire is ready for cooking and signaling. Before this it was not hot enough to cook, and signaling would put out the fire. Add fuel wood to the fire every few hours to keep fire burning through the night.  Put out your fire. When you are finished with the fire and ready to move on, smother the fire completely so it is cool to the touch. Disassemble the fire ring and return the area as close as possible to how it was before you arrived. Cooking Making a tripod. Ideally, if a string is available, lash a tripod and hang a pot from it over the fire. Balance your pot on flat wood. If there is no string available, lay a bed of fuel wood flat enough so that a pot can be balanced on top. Make sure that the fire still touches the pot Use a rock if you don't have a pot. Leave a large piece of flat rock on the fire to heat up, and then use it as a frying pan Signaling Add a living branch of wet leaves to the fire once it is fully self-sustaining to produce a large cloud of smoke, but only attempt this after the fire has been started and is strong, so it is not extinguished.  Prepare a signaling system for emergency. Have leaves attached to a branch, so they can all be removed and added at once if needed. If you know Morse Code, signal it in puffs of smoke. Warming Up Dry all your clothes that are wet. This is very important because even with snow on the ground, it is better to be naked in front of a fire then with wet clothes on. Wet cotton is the worst of the fabrics (especially sweaters and sweat pants), and will sap all warmth out very quickly. Build a drying place for your clothes.
