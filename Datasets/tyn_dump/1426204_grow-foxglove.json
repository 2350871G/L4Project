If you decide to start foxglove from seed, you'll need to be ready to plant it in early summer. If you're planting seedlings, you may plant in spring or fall. If you're starting from seed, use 4-inch seed trays with seed compost. Lightly press the seeds into the compost. Do not cover the seeds with more compost once they are sown, since they require light to germinate. Plan to plant the seedlings when they are a few inches tall."

You\u2019ll want to use a large container that is at least 16 inches (40.6 cm) in diameter, with drainage holes at the bottom. Use a potting mix with 2 inches (5.1 cm) of compost mixed into the top inches and plant the foxglove so that the root ball is covered. Make sure to place your foxglove where it will get 3 to 6 hours of direct sun each day while it\u2019s inside. Try a south or west-facing window. Cover the plant\u2019s soil surface with a 2-inch deep layer of mulch. This will keep the soil moist. Water the plant deeply about twice each week, checking the soil first \u2013 if the soil is dry at a depth of two inches, water. Fertilize the foxglove once in the spring before it flowers, using a 10-10-10 water-soluble fertilizer. Mix in one tablespoon of fertilizer in a gallon of water for each plant."
