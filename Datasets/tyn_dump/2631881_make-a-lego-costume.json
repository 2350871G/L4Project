Get a tube that's at least 4\u20135 inches (10\u201313 cm) wider than the diameter of your head so you're still comfortable. Transfer the measurement for the height of your head onto the tube and carefully push a utility knife through it. Follow along the mark you made to cut completely around the tube.You can buy forming tubes from your local hardware store or online. Don't use a tube that's too narrow or else the LEGO head will look too skinny and your head may not fit inside. Double check the inner diameter of the tube before you buy it since it may be different than the outer diameter."

If you can't find a helper, take your measurements in front of a mirror so you can see better. Cut a form tube so it's the same height as your head. Form tubes are thick cardboard cylinders that are usually used to form concrete pillars, so they are sturdy enough for your LEGO head. Get a tube that's at least 4\u20135 inches (10\u201313 cm) wider than the diameter of your head so you're still comfortable. Transfer the measurement for the height of your head onto the tube and carefully push a utility knife through it. Follow along the mark you made to cut completely around the tube.You can buy forming tubes from your local hardware store or online. Don't use a tube that's too narrow or else the LEGO head will look too skinny and your head may not fit inside. Double check the inner diameter of the tube before you buy it since it may be different than the outer diameter. Shape \u20442 in (1.3 cm) foam into 4 discs matching the tube's diameter. Use sheets of Styrofoam that are \u20442 in (1.3 cm) thick to make your discs. Trace the outer diameter of the form tubing on your foam 4 times so you can cut out each shape. Hold the foam steady with your nondominant hand and carefully along your outlines with a serrated bread knife. Follow as closely along the lines as you can so the discs are all the same shape.You can buy sheets of Styrofoam online or from craft stores. Be careful so you don't break off pieces of the Styrofoam while you're cutting it. Make the top and bottom head pieces by gluing 2 foam discs together for each. Check that the foam discs line up perfectly when you stack them, and trim off any excess material with your knife. Apply a thin coat of spray adhesive to the flat sides of one of the discs and press a second disc on top of it. Make any adjustments quickly so the edges are flush. Repeat the process for the other 2 discs you cut. Let the spray adhesive dry for 10-15 minutes before handling the pieces again.Work in a well-ventilated area since the spray adhesive may create harmful fumes. Avoid using hot glue or rubber cement since it could melt through the Styrofoam. Don't trim off too much foam or else the pieces will fall into the form tube. Attach the top and bottom pieces to the form tube. Set one of the pieces you just glued on top of the form tubing and line it up so the edges are flush. Slowly wrap a layer of masking tape around the seam between the foam and the tube, being careful not to leave any creases or raised edges. Go around the seam 3-4 times to hold it securely in place. Repeat the process to attach the bottom piece.If the top and bottom pieces feel loose against the tubing, try using more layers of masking tape over the seam to hold it in place better. Rip or cut the tap into smaller sections so it's less likely to bend or leave visible creases. Remove a portion of the bottom foam piece so you can fit your head inside. Draw a circle in the center of the bottom piece that's 2 inches (5.1 cm) wider than the diameter of your head. Carefully stab your knife through the center of the circle and cut toward the outline you drew. Slowly work around the circle until you can fit your head into the tube.You can trace a bowl or dish if you don't want to draw a circle freehand. Don't try to force your head into the tube since you could break the foam and need to build the bottom piece again. Sand the edges of the foam disks to curve them.

Sanding foam can be messy and put foam particles in the air, so wear safety glasses and a dust mask while you're working. Glue a smaller foam disc in the center of the top piece. Cut another foam disc that has a diameter of about 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) and sand one of the edges so it's slightly rounded. Spray a small amount of spray adhesive onto one side of the smaller disc and press it onto the center of the top piece. Hold it there for at least 5 seconds while the glue sets.The smaller disc on top of the head is the \u201cstud\u201d piece that LEGO figurines have so you can stack other things on them. Be careful not to press onto the disc too hard or else you could break through the top piece. Cut out eye holes so you can still see when you wear the head.

Assembling the Body Take your body measurements so you know how large to sculpt the body. Start the end of a flexible tape measure at the top of your shoulders and extend it down to you your waist so you know how tall the body needs to be. Then measure from one end of your shoulders to the other so you know the width of the body. Take another measurement from the front of your chest to the bottom of your shoulder blades to see how deep you need to make the body.Ask a partner to help you take the measurements since and can be difficult to find them on your own.

The side pieces: 2 rectangles where the short sides are 2 inches (5.1 cm) longer than the depth of your chest and the others equal to the length as the angled sides on the trapezoid pieces. The top piece: 1 rectangle, where the long sides equal your shoulder width and the short side equals is 2 inches (5.1 cm) longer than your chest depth.Tip: You can buy sheets of cardboard from craft stores or online.

Put on solid-colored pants and shoes that are the same color. The leg and foot pieces on a LEGO figurine are typically the same color, so look for pants and shoes that match one another. Find something comfortable to wear and matches the outfit on the rest of your LEGO body. Look for closed-toed shoes, like boots or sneakers, to help them blend in with your pants more.You can try using boxes to make LEGO legs, but they are difficult to walk in and uncomfortable. Slide the body piece over your arms and head. Stick your arms out above your head and reach through the bottom of the LEGO body. Put your hands through the armholes and shimmy the body down until you can slide your head through. Pull the body down so it's flat on your shoulders so you comfortably move around.Don't try to put your head through the hole before you put your arms in since you'll deform the cardboard and break the body. Place the LEGO head on so you can see out of it. Grab the LEGO head and position the eyeholes on the front side so you can see. Slowly set it onto your head so it doesn't break or fall down too fast. Readjust the head again until you can look straight ahead without obstructing your vision.The LEGO head may wobble around while you're wearing it, so you may need to adjust it throughout the day.",

        "Don't try to force your head into the tube since you could break the foam and need to build the bottom piece again.",
        "Sand the edges of the foam disks to curve them.",
        "LEGO figurines have smooth, rounded heads so work away any sharp corners with 180-grit sandpaper.",
        "Work around the top and bottom edge of the foam pieces until they have a gentle curve.",
