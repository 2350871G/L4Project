Then do the same to the bottom lash line and your waterline (the side of your bottom lashes closest to your eyeball) by pulling your undereye skin down slightly. Use a gel or liquid liner for your upper lash line if you like, but only use pencil on your waterline, because liquid liner will easily transfer to your eyeball from your waterline and irritate your eye.

Katya Gudaeva\t\t\tProfessional Makeup Artist\t\t\t\tNew to eyeliner? According to professional makeup artist Katya Gudaeva: \"If you're a beginner with eyeliner, start with an angled brush and eyeshadow. It gives you a little more wiggle room, so if you make a mistake it's easier to fix. You can just dip a cotton swab into micellar water then use it to clean up the line. Then, if you want, you can go over the eyeshadow with a liquid liner.\""
