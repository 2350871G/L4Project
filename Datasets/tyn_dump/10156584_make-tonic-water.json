Once the water has calmed to a simmer, stir in \u00bc cup (28 grams) of chopped cinchona bark. Alternatively, if you can\u2019t locate cinchona bark, you can use the powdered version, called quinine. Add 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of the quinine to the water and stir thoroughly to combine. Keep in mind that ingesting too much quinine can be hazardous to your health, so don\u2019t add more quinine than needed. In general, cinchona bark is safer, as it is easier to filter from the tonic. If you can\u2019t find quinine or cinchona bark in the herb aisle of your local grocery store, look in your local natural health store."
