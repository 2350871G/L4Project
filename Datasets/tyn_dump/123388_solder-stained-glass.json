Plug in your soldering iron, set it on its stand, and allow it to heat up. It's important to have everything set up before you begin the soldering process, because precise timing is very important in this project. Cut a length of adhesive copper foil to fit your glass pieces. Solder won't stick to glass by itself--you need another metal on the surface to hold it in. Adhesive copper foil will wrap around the edge of the glass you want to solder. Measure this by lining up the copper foil along the edge of the glass, leaving about \u20448 inch (3.2 mm) on each end. Then cut the foil carefully with your scissors. You can buy readymade strips of foil from most craft stores. Remove the backing from the strip of adhesive foil. After you cut the foil pieces, you can gently peel the backing off. You should be able to easily strip away the paper backing from the foil, revealing the adhesive side. Place the adhesive side of the copper foil on the edge of the glass. Try to position the edge of the glass directly on the center of the copper foil. Then, press the foil down gently around the edges of the glass. Be careful when wrapping the foil around sharp edges! You can wear heavy-duty craft gloves to protect your hands from cuts. Use a roller to make sure the foil is firmly on the glass. Use a roller or a pencil to roll out any creases, wrinkles, or bubbles in the foil. This is very important because the solder may not bond with wrinkled foil. Repeat until all your glass pieces are lined with foil. Each one of the pieces you plan to use should have foil wrapped all the way around it. Double-check to be sure the foil is firmly stuck on all the glass edges. Brush a coat of liquid flux onto the copper foil. The flux helps the metal in the solder and the foil to stick together permanently. Brush one coat of liquid flux onto all of the copper foil. It doesn't have to be applied perfectly, so long as all the foil is covered. Soldering Prepared Glass Pieces Position your glass pieces for soldering. Assemble your glass pieces into their final design position. Leave a very thin gap (about \u204416 inch (1.6 mm)) between the pieces so the solder will be able to flow into the seam. You can assemble the glass on any hard, heat-resistant surface, but metal work tables are best. Unroll about 4 inches (100 mm) of solder from the coil. This will melt to form the bond between the two pieces of glass. Since most solder contains lead, it's best to wear gloves to prevent accidental poisoning. Hold the coil of solder in your left hand and the soldering iron in your right hand. This can be reversed if you are left-handed. Choose whichever is more comfortable for you. Be very careful picking up the soldering iron--the tip can easily cause serious burns. Place the tip of the unrolled solder above the copper foil.

Cutting Glass for Soldering Choose your design. Decide what you'd like to make and how much glass and solder you'll need for it. The amounts of both will depend on what you're trying to make, but if you're a beginner, it's best to start out small with a simple design. Put the glass on a towel on a hard surface. You'll want to brace the glass against something hard, but too much force can cause it to shatter.

Using your glass cutter, press down firmly and make one single score, from one edge to the other, where you'd like the glass to break. It's very important to make only one score line in order to get a clean break. Be careful scoring the glass--both the cutter and the glass itself can be dangerous. Snap the glass along the score line. Carefully break the glass along the line you made. The simplest way to do this is by holding the glass with one hand on each side of the line. Make a quick snapping motion and the glass will separate along the score line. Score the glass until you have enough to work with. Continue scoring and breaking glass until you make enough glass pieces to create your project. Most stained glass projects use pieces that fit together like a puzzle.
