You should make the hole a little less than halfway down the cup. This is where your cup will connect to the center cup. Note to kids:  use scissors under adult supervision. Cut four holes under the lip of the center cup. Ideally, these holes will be evenly spaced around the top of the cup, just under the lip. This will help the anemometer stay balanced as it turns. The holes should be the same size as those you cut into the four outer cups. Cut a hole in the bottom of the center cup. Make this hole large enough to insert a pencil or other small pole. It should be exactly in the center of the cup\u2019s base. This hole will allow you to set the center post in your anemometer. Building the Anemometer Staple a straw to two of the outer cups. Push the straw through the hole of the outer cup until it reaches the opposite edge. Then bend the end of the straw that is touching the opposite edge down against the inside edge of the cup. Staple the straw into place. Repeat this process for a second cup, but not for all four cups. The last two cups will be assembled differently. For children:  have a responsible adult present for stapling. Push two straws through the center cup. Each straw should enter at one side of the center cup and exit on the opposite side through two of the top holes.

Push the pin down as securely as possible so that they don't move while you're using your anemometer. Calibrating the Anemometer Ask someone to take you for a slow ride in a car. Have them drive down a street that isn\u2019t busy at ten miles per hour. This will create a steady and controlled amount of wind. Try to calibrate your anemometer on a day that is not very windy, as natural wind could alter the results. Do not attempt to drive and calibrate the anemometer alone. Hold your anemometer out the window. Grasping only the center post, hold the anemometer out the window.
