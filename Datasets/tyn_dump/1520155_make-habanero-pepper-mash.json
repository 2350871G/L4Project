The gloves need to fit against the skin snugly and not allow capsicum from the peppers to seep through and get into your skin. If you ignore this, the peppers you handle will make your hands have a burning or throbbing sensation for hours, possibly all day. When handling the peppers or seeds, wear these gloves. When through, make sure to wash the gloves well and rinse with plenty of water before removing them. To be extra safe, wash your hands as well and rinse with copious amounts of water. This will prevent the capsicum from the peppers and seeds from irritating your sensitive skin and membranes, should you happen to touch these areas."

If you bite into one, you will feel a rush of sweetness, then the heat will hit you and you might regret taking such a big bite.

The real heat comes from the connecting veins that attach the seeds inside the peppers to the pepper walls. You can always use the seeds for planting more peppers. If you intend to save the seeds for planting, don't save the seeds from puny, stunted peppers. Save those from the biggest, fattest peppers for planting. That way you will have more fat peppers in your next harvest."

If you plan to save the seeds, use a sharp paring knife to slice into each pepper and pry it open with your fingers, then scrape the seeds out, one pepper at a time.

However, you can still spread them on paper towels and dry them in a food dryer or in an oven at 110\u2109 (43\u2103) for a day. You may then pulverize the seeds in your blender at high speed, then put the resulting dust in a salt or pepper shaker. Instead of using a blender, you may also push the peppers, with or without seeds, through a juice extractor. This will extract the seeds and a good amount of the pulp. Cycle it through the juicer several times to get out as much of the pulp as possible. Use the output of the juicer for the fermentation process.
