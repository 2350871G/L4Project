Keep them in the oven until you are ready to bake the sandwiches. Melt the butter. Take out 24 pieces of white bread. Melt two sticks of butter in the microwave, or in a pot on the stove. Pour the butter into a bowl. Apply butter to the bread. Use a pastry or basting brush to apply the butter to the bread. First, butter 12 slices of bread and lay them face down on a cutting board. Then, butter what will be the outside of the other 12 slices of bread. Place the cheese. You will need 24 slices of cheddar cheese. Put 2 slices of cheddar cheese squarely on top of 12 slices of bread. Make sure you are putting the cheese on the unbuttered side of the bread. You can put more or less cheese on each sandwich, depending on your preference. Complete the sandwich assembly. Put the remaining 12 slices of bread on top of the cheese. Again, the unbuttered side of the bread should be placed on top of the cheese. You should have 12 sandwiches when you are finished. Baking Grilled Cheese Sandwiches Put the sandwiches on a baking sheet. Take the baking sheets out of the oven once you are done making the sandwiches. Arrange the 12 sandwiches evenly on the first baking sheet. Depending on the size of the baking sheet, you may be able to fit more or less than 12 sandwiches. If you can\u2019t fit 12 sandwiches, use the second baking sheet, and quickly warm up two more baking sheets in the oven.

The second baking sheet acts as a panini press, making both sides of the sandwich crispy. Bake for 10-12 minutes. Carefully place the baking sheets in the oven. Allow them to bake for 10-12 minutes. The time may vary depending on your oven, so check the sandwiches after a few minutes. Remove them from the oven when the bread is golden brown, and the cheese has melted. Allow them to cool for a few minutes and then serve warm. Using Alternative Ingredients Use mayonnaise. You can spread mayonnaise on the bread instead of butter. Any type of mayonnaise will work. Mayonnaise spreads easier than butter, and the bread often comes out with an even golden brown. Try out different cheeses. Experiment with different types of cheeses on your grilled cheese. Outside of cheddar, you can also use provolone, pepper jack, Swiss, mozzarella, etc. Use one type of cheese on each sandwich, or use at least two types of cheeses on each sandwich. Change out the bread. If you don\u2019t like white bread, you can experiment with other options. For example, you can use wheat and sourdough bread.
