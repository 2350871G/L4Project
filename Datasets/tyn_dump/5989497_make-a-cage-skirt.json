If you want a full length cage skirt, use your waist to ankle measurement; if you want a knee length cage skirt, use your waist to knee measurement; etc. Note this number for when you go to purchase your fabric. Decide how full you want your skirt to be. To do this, lay the boning in a circle on the floor around you and keep widening or narrowing the circle until the hoop is the size that you want the largest part of your skirt to be. You can also use a simple math equation to figure out how long to make your boning strip. For example, if you want your skirt to be 30\" across at the widest part, multiply 30 by Pi (3.14) and use the rounded result (94inches) as your boning length. Gathering and Preparing Materials Calculate how much fabric you will need. The total amount of fabric you will need is based on your choices for the length and width of the skirt.

So if your fabric measures 35\u201d by 94\u201d, then you should cut your ribbon pieces into 94\u201d strands. You will need the same number of ribbon pieces as boning pieces. Sewing Your Cage Skirt Sew together the short ends of your largest piece of fabric. This large piece will be the skirt. Before you sew, fold your fabric in half width-wise and match up the two shorter ends of the fabric so that they are perfectly even. You can pin the edges together or just sew them together right away. When you sew the ends together, make sure to leave about \u00bd inch of material at the seam. Pin the ribbon pieces to your skirt fabric. Pin the ribbon pieces to what will be the inside of your skirt. Remember to space the ribbons about 5\u201d apart, but also leave 2\u201d below the lowest ribbon and an extra 2\u201d (7\u201d total) above the highest ribbon. Sew the ribbon pieces onto your skirt. Sew along the long edges of the ribbon pieces. Stay very close to the edge of the ribbon as you sew so that you will be able to slide the boning into the space between the skirt and the ribbon. Do not close off the seam at the ends of the ribbon. Make sure that you can lift up the ribbon a bit and that you can slide the boning into the tube you have created. Create the waist for your skirt.
