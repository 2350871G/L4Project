If your skin has dry or red patches, this means that you have a dry skin type. However, if your face looks oily all over, this means that you have an oily skin type. Make sure that you don\u2019t wipe or blot your face during this time so that you get an accurate result for your skin type. There are also a few other skin types. For example, you have a normal skin type if your skin does not change, or a combination skin type if just your T-zone looks oily.

Coconut oil may be beneficial to your skin if it\u2019s too dry or too oily, however, it may not be useful if you have a normal or combination skin type. Coconut oil can be useful for people with dry skin, as it can add oil and moisture which your skin needs to be healthy. Contrastingly, it can also be helpful for people with oily skin, as many harsh acne treatment products will strip your skin of too many natural oils. This means that your skin overcompensates by producing too much oil which exacerbates the acne. Coconut oil has a score of 4 out of 5 on the comedogenicity scale. This scale ranks ingredients from the least pore blocking (1) to the most pore blocking (5). This means that coconut oil may not be helpful in treating acne for all skin types."
