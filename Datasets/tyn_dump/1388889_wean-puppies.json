Puppy food is high in protein and basic nutrients and as such will help your dog gain that much needed weight. With this in mind, you don\u2019t want to cause your dog to gain too much weight. You might choose to begin feeding your pregnant pooch puppy food when you discover her pregnancy or if you know that your dog is prone to weight fluctuations, you might decide to wait until 2-3 weeks before its whelping (the birth). Moreover, you should choose the puppy chow that you plan on feeding your puppies. This will make it easier for the puppies to transition to puppy food \u2014 in terms of their overall health and more specifically their GI balance."
