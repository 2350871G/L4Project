Preparing to Sew in a Zipper Purchase a zipper that is the correct size and style for your project. Zippers come in a wide variety of colors, styles, and sizes. Pick the one that works best for your project. If you can't find a zipper that is the perfect length, purchase a zipper that is slightly longer than the seam opening you want to put it in. This will give you some leeway in positioning the zipper and will help you avoid hitting the end stop of the zipper with your sewing needle, which would break it. Pre-wash the zipper to prevent shrinkage. This is only necessary if your zipper is made of natural materials. Simply follow package recommendations, as most zippers are made from man-made materials but some are made from natural fibers such as cotton. Press the fabric sides of the zipper. Make sure it is as flat as possible. Use a gentle heat to prevent melting the zipper if the teeth are made of plastic. Zippers with metal teeth can stand up to more heat from an iron. Cut pieces of fusible lightweight interfacing into one inch strips that are as long as your seam. This is only necessary if you are using a lightweight fabric that is not very strong or stiff. The interfacing will be used to make it stronger and stiffer, better able to handle the repetitive pressure that is caused by a zipper being opened and closed. Insert the interfacing into the seam area of your project. Simply follow the directions on your fusible interfacing to complete this step. In most cases you will simply place the thin strips of interfacing on the wrong side of your fabric right next to the seam. You will then iron over the fabric and interfacing, which will attach the interfacing to the fabric.",
