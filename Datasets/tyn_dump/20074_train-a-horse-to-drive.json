As your horse moves forward, say \u201cWalk,\u201d loudly and clearly. Face your horse as it moves around the circle, keeping your body just behind the withers and the lunge whip at the hip. Position yourself so that you form a triangle between the horse\u2019s haunches, its shoulder, and yourself. You will use your body position to help drive the horse forward. You moving with your horse tells it to keep moving forward. To slow down or stop, relax your body, move with your horse more slowly, and lower the whip. Say \u201cStop!\u201d or \u201cWhoa!\u201d clearly. To start trotting, raise your shoulders slightly, move more energetically, and slightly elevate the lunge whip at your horse\u2019s hip.

        "Long line your horse from behind with the harness on and practice every verbal command.",
        "Train in both directions.",
        "Take your time and don\u2019t rush the training, so that you and your horse can build confidence and trust.",
        "This is as close as you can get to real driving without using a cart!",
        "If your horse loses confidence or has trouble at any time, simply return to a previous stage like lunging or long lining to get more practice.",
        "Adding Weight and Attaching a Cart Train your horse to drag objects while ground driving in the harness.",
        "Learning to pull weight is an essential part of driving.",
        "Attach heavy cotton ropes to the harness and let these drag behind your horse as you ground drive.",
        "When your horse is comfortable, practice with heavier weights by tying the ropes around PVC pipes and then a tire.",
        "Practice every gait, verbal command, and direction while ground driving with the added weight.",
        "The PVC pipes and tire will bounce around.",
        "This is ideal because it helps to desensitize your horse to the noise, weight, and movement of a cart.",
        "Get professional advice before you start driving your horse.",
        "Contact a driving instructor or your local driving club.",
        "They will visit you and your horse and watch you work with the harness.",
        "Take any advice that they give on-board and don\u2019t begin driving with a cart until you have been given the all-clear.",
        "Don\u2019t feel discouraged if the driving professional suggests that you repeat some training.",
        "Safety is essential while driving, and the instructor just wants to make sure that you and your horse are fully prepared.",
        "Attach the driving cart to your horse once you are both confident.",
        "Place the cart in the middle of the pen and let your horse inspect it for as long as necessary.",
        "Show your horse any noises that the cart makes before you attach it.",
        "When your horse is fully comfortable, place the harness on and attach the cart shafts to the harness.",
        "Walk alongside your horse and get 2 other people to help pull the cart as your horse moves so that it can get used to the new feeling.",
        "If your horse loses confidence at any point, remove the cart immediately.",
        "Return to an earlier stage of training to build trust again before slowly reintroducing the cart.",
        "Never remove the bridle of a horse that is attached to a cart.",
        "This is because there would be no way to control the horse if an accident happened.",
        "Never leave a horse unattended while it\u2019s attached to a cart.",
        "Accidents can happen very quickly and with little to no warning.",
        "Enter the cart and slowly begin driving.",
        "Begin in a safe, quiet, and secure location.",
        "Communicate with the driving lines and verbal cues like you would while ground driving.",
        "Start with simply walking on and halting, before moving on to turning and trotting.",
        "Practice slowly and steadily so that you and your horse gain confidence and trust.",
        "Join your local driving club to gain more experience, learn new skills, and attend driving outings when your horse is ready.",
        "Whenever you are in the cart, always wear a riding helmet.",
        "This goes for passengers too.",
        "When you first begin driving in more risky situations like on roads, at shows, or with other horses, always have someone experienced with you.",
        "They can provide advice and assistance if anything unexpected happens."
