First, decide how many drums you want, along with the depth and diameter of each drum. At the least, you will want a snare drum and a bass drum, but adding a few toms will round out your kit. You will also need to decide on the color of your drums' shells and hardware, and the wood used for the shells. Maple, birch, and beech are all common choices for drum shells. You will need to decide on how any toms will be mounted; if you mount any toms to the bass drum, you will need the appropriate hardware to do so."

Each drum will need the following hardware: rims, tension rods with washers, and lugs. Toms will need mounts and arms, while bass drums will need spurs. The snare drum will also need a strainer (also called a throw off), a butt, and a set of snares. When buying shells, make sure that the bearing edges (the angled part where the rim meets the shell) are already planed. Planing them yourself would represent a major undertaking.
