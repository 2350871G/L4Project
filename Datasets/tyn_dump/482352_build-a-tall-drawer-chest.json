            "description": "The chest shown here had to fit in a cavity in the wall that was 37\u201d wide and 24\u201d deep and went up all the way to the ceiling, so the chest of drawers was planned to be about 4 feet (1.2 m) tall, 3 feet (0.9 m) wide and 2 feet (0.6 m) deep. The chest box is made up of 5 panels of 3/4th inch plywood, two sides, a top and a bottom, and the front. The back will b of 1/4th inch MDF. The dimensions of the 5 3/4th inch panels for the chest box were: Top panel = 22\u201d x 34\u201d; Bottom panel = 22\u201d x 34\u201d; Left panel = 22\u201d x 46\u201d; Right panel = 22\u201d x 46\u201d; Front panel = 20.5\u201d x 44.5\u201d. A paper template with 1\u201d = 1 foot (0.3 m) and then laid these on 4\u201dx 8\u201d  to see how to cut these from 4 feet (1.2 m) x 8 feet (2.4 m) plywood panels. Based on the best fit, lines were drawn on a 3/4th inch plywood panel and the individual pieces were cut. See the set-up to cut these without a table saw. The panels were stained with a gel based stain that simulated mahogany."

            "headline": "Assemble the bottom panel.",
            "description": "The bottom panel is assembled by screwing in metal 3/4th inch L-brackets to the left front, right front, left back, and right back as shown in the diagram. Screw holes for the L-brackets are not shown, but each leg of the L had two screw holes. The brackets were coated with glue (Gorilla glue) and then screwed into the edge of the plywood. These brackets add a bit of strength during the assembly process. Two 3/4th inch by 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) strips of wood were cut to a length 1.5 in longer than the front of the panel (3/4 in x 1.5 in, sold as 1x2 strips). One strip was attached to the front edge of the bottom panel with a \u20444 inch (1.9 cm) overhang on each side. The other strip is similarly attached to the top panel. Strips are cut of the same length as the sides of the panel (22 inches) and then glued and screwed into the side edges of the top and bottom panel to form a three sided tray. Finally you will end up with a top and bottom panel for the chest that have three strips covering the front and side edges of the plywood sheets. The strips will project about 3/4th inch from the surface of the plywood. The back edge of the plywood does not have a strip."

Place the back panel of the chest cut from 1/4th inch hardboard or MDF. This panel has to be cut with square edges as it will help pull the chest into an exact rectangle once it is attached to the back of the carcass. Place a bead of the gorilla glue onto the edge of the plywood of the chest carcass and carefully place the back onto the carcass. Attach the left side of the panel to the plywood with \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) screws. Then adjust the chest carcass till it is aligned with the other edge of the back panel.
