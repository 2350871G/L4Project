Get a number of radios based on how many people you want to have a radio. If you\u2019re just planning on chatting with a friend, get a pair. If you\u2019re hoping to staff a security team or other set of professionals, get 10-20 radios based on the number of employees or team members that you have. All of the walkie talkies that you plan on using need to be the same make, model, and brand. You may notice that it becomes difficult to track what people say if you have more than 10-15 people on a single frequency. This is a common issue with cheaper radios. If you want to use walkie talkies as a baby monitor or listening tool, get a version that has a \u201cmonitor\u201d mode."

Plug them into the charging stand or USB charger and wait until the light on the radio indicates that they\u2019re fully charged. Take the radio off of the charger and turn the dial at the top to turn it on. On most radios, you\u2019ll see a green light turn on. If it has a screen, this should pop on as well. Every style of walkie talkie is different, but almost every type of radio will have a light on the charger or walkie that turns on when it\u2019s being charged. Some radios use batteries instead of chargers. These aren\u2019t a good option if you\u2019re planning on using your radios regularly, since the batteries can be a pain to replace. Some cheaper radios won\u2019t have dials. Look for a power button if you can\u2019t find a dial to turn it on."

Even if they\u2019re the same brand and model, people on channel 1 will only be able to hear and talk to other people on channel 1.

Turn the volume up as high as it will go and press the \u201cpress-to-talk\u201d button before saying something. The press-to-talk button is usually the biggest button on the side of the walkie talkie. Confirm that each radio works before splitting them up. Once the radios are split up, it\u2019s a good idea to test them again just in case they\u2019re out of range or something is wrong with the antenna. If channel 1 isn\u2019t working, move to channel 2. Sometimes the individual frequencies get a little messy. This can be caused by other radio waves or interference. The number of frequencies ranges from 2-10 based on the type of radio you have. If none of the channels seem to work, double-check the volume knobs. Then, if they still don\u2019t work, look on each radio for a sync button. Hold the sync buttons down at the same time on every radio to link them up."

Get a set of radio earpieces that work with your brand of radio and have a built-in microphone.

        "Some radios use batteries instead of chargers.",
        "These aren\u2019t a good option if you\u2019re planning on using your radios regularly, since the batteries can be a pain to replace.",

        "Get earpieces if you\u2019re using radios professionally.",
        "If you\u2019re setting up radios for a security team, construction crew, school staff, or hospitality team, you need to get earpieces so that the conversations over the radio remain private.",
        "Get a set of radio earpieces that work with your brand of radio and have a built-in microphone.",
        "Plug an earpiece in, wrap the speaker around your ear, and press the button on the microphone built into the cord to talk to the other radios.",
        "To be on the safe side, buy your earpieces from the same company that makes your walkie talkies.",

        "To activate the microphone on your walkie talkie, press the \u201cpush-to-talk\u201d or \u201cPTT\u201d button.",
        "On almost all makes and models, the PTT button is the biggest button on the radio and it\u2019s almost always on the side of the unit.",
        "On some radios, the button will simply be labelled \u201ctalk\u201d for short.",
        "On an earpiece, the PTT button is on the small case attached to the cable near the top of the earpiece.",

        "On higher-end radios, the microphone is normally right underneath the antenna and will look like a vent.",
        "On cheaper radios, look for a small group of holes in the plastic case.Tip: The microphone in walkie talkies is usually designed to only pick up sound within 1\u20132 feet (30\u201361 cm) of the microphone.",

        "Wait 1-2 seconds before you start speaking.",
        "Waiting 1-2 seconds before speaking allows your walkie talkie to establish a clear connection  with the other radios on the frequency.",
        "If you don't pause before speaking, the beginning of your  message might get cut off and you may have to repeat yourself.",
        "This is usually a problem for cheaper radios, but it's still a good idea to wait at least 1 second to establish the connection before you speak.",
        "Keep your message short and pronounce words clearly.",
        "Keep the button held down and say whatever you need to say.",
        "It can be kind of tricky to make out what people say over a radio so it helps if you keep your messages short.",
        "Think about what you want to say before pressing the PTT button and enunciate each word so that everyone can clearly hear what you\u2019re trying to say.",
        "Avoid saying personal or private things over a walkie talkie unless you know for a fact that everyone on the channel is wearing an earpiece and it\u2019s essential that everyone hears it.",
        "If you\u2019re using a radio in a professional setting, avoid using it to chat about random things that aren\u2019t related to your work.",
        "Radio lines should generally be kept open for important information.",
        "Release the button immediately after speaking and wait for a response.",
        "Once you\u2019re done talking, quickly release the PTT button and hold the radio up to your ear.",
        "You will not be able to hear anyone if the PTT button is still being held down, since the PTT button automatically shuts the speaker off.",
        "This prevents the microphone from picking up white noise or cross-talk, so keep your finger off of the button while you\u2019re waiting for a response.",
        "Repeat this process whenever you want to talk.",
        "Hold the button down to talk and release it to listen.",
        "Turn your radio off and charge it after every use.",
        "After every use, plug your walkie talkie in to let it charge when you\u2019re not using it.",
        "This way you\u2019ll have a set of fully-charged radios when you need them.",
        "This is especially important in a professional situation where the radios are being used daily, since they tend to take a long time to charge.",
        "Some cheaper radios rely on batteries and can\u2019t by charged.",
        "Keep a set of spare batteries nearby in the event that the batteries in the radio die.",
        "Using Radio Codes to Communicate Say \u201cover\u201d right after you\u2019re done speaking to indicate you\u2019re finished.",
        "One problem with using radios is that other people can\u2019t hear what you\u2019re saying if they\u2019re holding down the PTT button.",
        "To work around this, say \u201cover\u201d as soon as you\u2019re done talking.",
        "This is a signal to everyone else on the frequency that you\u2019re releasing the PTT button and will be able to hear responses.",
        "For example, if you say, \u201cI\u2019m over on Main street\u201d but don\u2019t say \u201cover\u201d at the end, other radio users on your channel will think that you\u2019re thinking about something and are about to speak.",
        "Instead, say \u201cI\u2019m over on Main street, over,\u201d and then release the button to listen.",
        "Usually you\u2019ll know everyone on a frequency and will be able to identify their voice or comments.",
        "If you\u2019re on a giant network of radios though, it may be a good idea to say your name before saying \u201cover.\u201d This is rare unless there are more than 10 people on a channel, but at that point you usually break up into multiple channels to minimize background noise.",
        "Stick with \u201ccopy\u201d instead of \u201cokay\u201d or \u201cgot it\u201d to show you understand.",
