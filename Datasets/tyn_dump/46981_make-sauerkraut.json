If you prefer to calculate the ratios of cabbage and salt needed instead of going off a measurement, weigh your cabbage and add about 2% of the cabbage's weight in salt. You'll need about 2 large heads of cabbage to get 4 \u20442 pounds (2.0 kg) of shredded cabbage. If you don't have fine ground salt, use kosher or pickling salt as long as they don't have additives such as iodine or anti-caking agents. These would make the brine cloudy and make fermentation difficult."
