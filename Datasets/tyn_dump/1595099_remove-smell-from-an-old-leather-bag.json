For instance, you might leave the bag on a table on a covered porch, or under a balcony. However, make sure you only place your leather bag outside on a clear, dry day. If it's raining out or you live somewhere really humid, the moisture in the air could damage the leather. Be sure not to leave the bag in full sun, as that may dry out or discolor the leather.
