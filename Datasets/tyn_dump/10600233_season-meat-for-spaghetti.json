For a basic recipe, try using about 1 teaspoon (5.69 g) of salt and \u00bd a teaspoon (1.15 g) of black pepper. Adjust the seasonings to suit your tastes."

They are frequently used to give depth to ground beef and turkey, but also try them with sweet or spicy meats. Cook the onions and garlic before you begin browning the meat. Dice up a small onion and 2 cloves of garlic. Cook them for about 7 minutes until they soften. The garlic softens faster than the onions, so consider saving it until the final 2 minutes of cooking time."

Some mixtures include parsley and other herbs. Add the herbs to browned meat to give it a balanced flavor that helps it stand out against heavy sauces and noodles. Any spices in an Italian herb mixture can be used separately. For example, use about \u00bd cup (10.1 g) of fresh basil to make the meat taste a little sweet and savory."
