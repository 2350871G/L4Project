This pattern calls for a size G (4.25 mm) crochet hook and lace weight (#0) or super fine weight (#1) yarn, but you can easily adapt it for use with different hooks and yarn. Keep in mind that larger hooks and heavier yarns will create chunkier bows. Work a foundation chain. Work 45 chain stitches from the loop on your hook to create a foundation for the bow. You can also vary the number of chains to create smaller or larger bows. The length of the foundation chain will be nearly six times as long as the final width of the bow. A foundation chain of this size should create a bow measuring approximately 3 inches (7.6 cm) across. Single crochet across. Single crochet once into the second chain from the hook, then work one single crochet into each chain across the foundation. Your stitch count for this row should be one less than the stitch count of your foundation. If you started with 45 chains, you should complete 44 single crochets in this row. Fasten off. Cut the yarn, leaving a tail measuring about 3 inches (7.6 cm). Pull this tail through the last loop on your hook to fasten off the yarn. Use a yarn needle to weave the start and end tails into the completed stitches. Doing so should hides these ends while further securing the yarn. Fold the strip. Loop the completed strip into the shape of a bow. You can either tie a basic bow from the strip or loosely fold the strip into the basic bow shape without tying it. Either option should work. Make sure that the loops and tails of the bow are even on both sides. Knot new yarn around the center. Cut 6 inches (15 cm) of yarn. Slide the new yarn beneath the center of the bow shape, then tie a basic overhand knot over the center of the bow. Wrap the center. Wrap the long end of the new yarn around the center of the bow several times. Once you're satisfied with the way it looks, tie a knot at the back of the bow using both ends of the new yarn. You should wrap the center at least four or five times to secure it. If you prefer a chunkier center, though, you can make additional wrap-arounds after that. Use the yarn needle to weave in both ends of the center yarn when finished. Method Two: Wide Bow[2]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source\n\t\t\n[3]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source Tie the yarn to the hook. Attach the yarn to the crochet hook using a standard slip knot. This pattern calls for a size J/10 (6 mm) crochet hook and light to medium-worsted weight yarn, but you can vary the hook size and yarn weight as desired to create different sizes. Use lighter yarn and a smaller hook for a daintier bow, or use heavier yarn and a larger hook to make a chunkier bow. Work a foundation round. Work 25 chain stitches from the loop on your hook to create a foundation for the rest of your stitches. Slip stitch the last chain to the first to create a round. You can alter the size of the bow by changing the number of chains. The final length of the bow will be about half the length of your foundation chain. Working 25 stitches with the pattern hook size and yarn weight should create a bow between 3 and 4 inches (7.6 and 10 cm) long. Half double crochet across. Chain two, then work one half double crochet into each chain across the foundation round. Slip stitch the last half double crochet to the top of the initial chain-two. The number of half double crochets should match the number of chains in your foundation. Work three more rounds of half double crochet. Complete three more rounds following the same pattern used in the previous round. Chain two, then half double crochet once into each of the stitches of the previous round. Slip stitch the final stitch to the top of the chain-two in each round. Turn the work over in between rounds to keep the stitch pattern even. Fasten off the yarn. Cut the yarn, leaving roughly 3 inches (7.6 cm). Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off. Use a yarn needle to weave the start and end tails into the inner stitches of the work. This step completes the body of the bow. You'll create the bow center separately. Tie new yarn to the hook. Attach new yarn to the crochet hook using a standard slip knot. This step starts the bow center. The yarn and hook used for the center of the bow should match that used for the body of the bow. Work a foundation chain. Work four chains from the loop on your hook, creating a foundation row. The exact number of chains can vary depending on the size of the bow and your personal preference. This chain will determine the width of the center, so you can add fewer or more depending on how wide you want the center to be. Single crochet across. Work one single crochet into the second chain from the hook, then work one single crochet into each remaining chain across the foundation. The number of single crochets made in this step should be one less than the number of stitches in your foundation. If you started with four chains, you should make three stitches in this step. Work additional single crochet rows. Continue working rows of single crochet until you have a strip of material long enough to wrap around the center of the bow body. For each row: chain one, single crochet once into the same stitch as the chain, and single crochet once into each stitch across the rest of the previous row. Turn the work over in between rows. The final strip should wrap tightly around the center of the bow body. It will need to be slightly larger than the width of the body. Fasten off the yarn. Cut the yarn, leaving 10 inches (25.4 cm) of excess. Pull the excess tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off. Wrap the short strip around the center of the bow. Fold the bow body to create one double-layered band. Cinch the center of that band, then wrap the smaller strip around that center. Center the seam of the bow body along the back of the folded band. The short ends of the bow center should meet over this seam. Sew the short ends together. Using the 10-inch (25.4-cm) tail and the yarn needle, whip stitch the stitches along the short ends of the bow center, fastening it together. After finishing the seam, knot the yarn and weave it into the stitches. Method Three: Magic Circle Bow[4]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source Make a magic circle with two chains. Wrap the yarn around the crochet hook into the form of a magic circle. Work two chain stitches over the edge of the circle. This pattern calls for a size B/1 (2.25 mm) hook and lace to super fine yarn, but you can experiment with different hooks and yarn weights to alter the size of the bow. Double crochet into the circle. Work six double crochet into the center of the magic circle. These double crochet will form one side of the bow. Work a connecting chain. Work three chain stitches, then slip stitch once into the center of the ring. The connecting chain will help separate the two sides from one another, making them distinct and preventing them from running together. Repeat the pattern. Create another bow side and another connecting chain following the same pattern used for the first set. To complete the second side of the bow, chain two and work six double crochet into the center of the magic ring. To complete the second connecting chain, chain three and slip stitch the last chain into the center of the magic ring. Tighten the loop. Carefully pull the ending tail of yarn, tightening the center of the magic ring in the process. Note that you may need to hold the starting tail steady to cinch the center closed. Continue tightening the center until the ring seems as tight as possible. Stop before the two sides of the bow can fold in on one another, though. Fasten off the yarn. Cut the yarn, leaving 6 inches (15 cm) of excess. Pull this excess tail through the last loop on the hook to fasten it off. Wrap the tail around the center. Wrap the remaining tail around the center of the bow several times to define the shape. When you're satisfied with how it looks, knot the tail at the back of the bow. Weave the starting tail and the remaining end tail into the back side of the stitches using a yarn needle.",

        "You'll create the bow center separately.",
        "Tie new yarn to the hook.",
        "Attach new yarn to the crochet hook using a standard slip knot.",
        "This step starts the bow center.",
        "The yarn and hook used for the center of the bow should match that used for the body of the bow.",
        "Work a foundation chain.",
        "Work four chains from the loop on your hook, creating a foundation row.",
        "The exact number of chains can vary depending on the size of the bow and your personal preference.",
        "This chain will determine the width of the center, so you can add fewer or more depending on how wide you want the center to be.",
        "Single crochet across.",
        "Work one single crochet into the second chain from the hook, then work one single crochet into each remaining chain across the foundation.",
        "The number of single crochets made in this step should be one less than the number of stitches in your foundation.",
        "If you started with four chains, you should make three stitches in this step.",
        "Work additional single crochet rows.",
        "Continue working rows of single crochet until you have a strip of material long enough to wrap around the center of the bow body.",
        "For each row: chain one, single crochet once into the same stitch as the chain, and single crochet once into each stitch across the rest of the previous row.",
        "Turn the work over in between rows.",
        "The final strip should wrap tightly around the center of the bow body.",
        "It will need to be slightly larger than the width of the body.",
        "Fasten off the yarn.",
        "Cut the yarn, leaving 10 inches (25.4 cm) of excess.",
        "Pull the excess tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off.",
        "Wrap the short strip around the center of the bow.",
        "Fold the bow body to create one double-layered band.",
        "Cinch the center of that band, then wrap the smaller strip around that center.",
        "Center the seam of the bow body along the back of the folded band.",
        "The short ends of the bow center should meet over this seam.",
        "Sew the short ends together.",
        "Using the 10-inch (25.4-cm) tail and the yarn needle, whip stitch the stitches along the short ends of the bow center, fastening it together.",
        "After finishing the seam, knot the yarn and weave it into the stitches.",
        "Method Three: Magic Circle Bow[4]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source Make a magic circle with two chains.",
        "Wrap the yarn around the crochet hook into the form of a magic circle.",
        "Work two chain stitches over the edge of the circle.",
        "This pattern calls for a size B/1 (2.25 mm) hook and lace to super fine yarn, but you can experiment with different hooks and yarn weights to alter the size of the bow.",
        "Double crochet into the circle.",
        "Work six double crochet into the center of the magic circle.",
        "These double crochet will form one side of the bow.",
        "Work a connecting chain.",
        "Work three chain stitches, then slip stitch once into the center of the ring.",
        "The connecting chain will help separate the two sides from one another, making them distinct and preventing them from running together.",
        "Repeat the pattern.",
        "Create another bow side and another connecting chain following the same pattern used for the first set.",
        "To complete the second side of the bow, chain two and work six double crochet into the center of the magic ring.",
        "To complete the second connecting chain, chain three and slip stitch the last chain into the center of the magic ring.",
        "Tighten the loop.",
        "Carefully pull the ending tail of yarn, tightening the center of the magic ring in the process.",
        "Note that you may need to hold the starting tail steady to cinch the center closed.",
        "Continue tightening the center until the ring seems as tight as possible.",
        "Stop before the two sides of the bow can fold in on one another, though.",
        "Fasten off the yarn.",
        "Cut the yarn, leaving 6 inches (15 cm) of excess.",
        "Pull this excess tail through the last loop on the hook to fasten it off.",
        "Wrap the tail around the center.",
        "Wrap the remaining tail around the center of the bow several times to define the shape.",
        "When you're satisfied with how it looks, knot the tail at the back of the bow.",
        "Weave the starting tail and the remaining end tail into the back side of the stitches using a yarn needle."
