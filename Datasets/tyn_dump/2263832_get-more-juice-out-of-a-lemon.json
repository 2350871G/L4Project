After freezing solid, take it out and let it thaw for 4-8 hours, until the rind reaches room temperature. When you heat it afterwards, the frozen juice will expand in the membrane of the fruit and break down. This will make the juicing process more efficient and give you the most juice possible. It\u2019s actually a lot harder to juice a lemon when it\u2019s cold or at room temperature. Heating the lemon before cutting it is the best way to juice your fruit."

This is faster than soaking the lemon in warm water, but it\u2019s a little riskier. If there are any tiny holes in the lemon\u2019s rind, you\u2019ll end up evaporating some of the juice. If your lemon is at room temperature, heat it for 10 seconds. If it was in the refrigerator, microwave it for 20 seconds."

Place your palm on top and press down with moderate pressure. Then, roll the lemon back and forth between your palm and the hard surface. Do this for 30-45 seconds to soften the membrane inside the lemon.Tip: If your lemon is on the harder side, you can use a rolling pin to compress it by rolling the pin over the lemon while pushing down."
