For example, a play set in a village in a deforested environment might show the impacts on a family unable to get clean drinking water, suffering from food shortages and relying on monotype crops. End the play with positive actions for remedying the damage; for example, show the village planting more trees again, putting in a ground well to get underground water supplies and re-introduction of native species of plants and animals."
