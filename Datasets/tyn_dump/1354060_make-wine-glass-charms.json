Bend the tip of the wire upwards at a 90 degree angle. Close the wine glass charm. In order to close the charm, place the turned end of the wire under the flattened end. Push the wire through the punched hole. If it doesn't hold, carefully pull the charm at the sides. This will create more tension. Use the charm.
