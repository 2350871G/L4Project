Once you applied the caulk, apply pressure to it for about 2 minutes while it sets. Put your weight on one of your feet so the shingle lays flush on your roof again. Repeat the process for any other loose or broken shingles on your roof. Install metal roofing if you live in an area with frequent severe storms. Metal roofing will last close to 50 years and can survive winds up to 140 mph (230 km/h). To install metal roofing, layer the panels so there are no gaps between them. Then, screw the panels together so they hold firmly, but not so tightly that it damages the paneling. Have a professional install metal roofing if you feel uncomfortable doing it yourself.
