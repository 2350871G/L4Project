It\u2019s just a little easier when the sides look different. Fold the left and right corners to touch the center of the diamond. The corner tips should meet in the center of the paper. Crease both folds firmly. Once you\u2019ve done this, flip the model over. Now your folds are facing the table. Your model should look like an elongated hexagon. Fold the long edges of the hexagon to the center. The long edges should meet at the center. As you fold them in, a triangle of paper will pop out on either side of your model. If the triangles don't pop out, but instead bend around the back of your model, just unfold them so they stick out. Fold the two sticking-out triangles in, to touch at the center of the model.

This crease will be helpful for lining up later folds. Fold the second diamond from the bottom in half, upward. The pointed tip of the paper you just folded should line up with the tip of the top diamond. Crease your fold firmly. Crease the top paper on the center line of the model and fold back. See where you creased the center of the whole model a few steps ago. Use that as the line to fold back your top piece of paper, which you folded up in the last step. You will now have a long part of your model and a short part of your model. The long part of your model will become the blade, and the short part will become the handle, or hilt. Fold inward both edges of the short part of your model to make the hilt. The edges will meet at the middle. Crease each side firmly. Squash down the triangles of paper that form. As the edges fold inward they will make small triangles of paper form. Flatten these crisply. This is called a squash fold. You should see the hilt of the sword starting to form. The hilt has a vertical handle, and a horizontal part, called the cross-guard. Fold the top part of your sword down and up to cover the cross-guard. First fold the whole model down over the cross-guard. Then fold up the top so that only the cross-guard is covered. If you flip the model over you will see that you have just made what looks like a proper hilt. Fold in the sides of your blade, with more squash folds. You don\u2019t want your blade to be as wide as your cross-guard. So fold in the long edges to meet at the middle. This will require more \u201csquash folds\u201d of squashing down the triangles of paper that form. Fold the bottom tip of the handle to square it off. Keep the triangle on the top of your sword for a pointy blade. But fold up the bottom triangle for a squared-off handle. Turn your model upside down, so the side facing the table is facing you. There\u2019s your sword! You can try making swords out of different colored paper, until you have enough for all your friends.
