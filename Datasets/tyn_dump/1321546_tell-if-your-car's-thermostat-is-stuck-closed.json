        "Look at the temperature of the engine and the upper hose after your vehicle has run for 10-15 minutes.",
        "If the temperatures are within 10\u00b0 Fahrenheit (18\u00b0 Celsius) of one another, then the thermostat is working properly.",
        "However, if the hose is still substantially cooler than the engine, then there isn\u2019t any coolant running through it and the thermostat stayed closed.",
        "If the hose is the same temperature as the engine but it\u2019s still overheating, then there may be another problem with your vehicle instead of the thermostat.",
        "Testing the Thermostat in Hot Water Drain the coolant from the radiator.",
        "Crawl underneath the front of your vehicle so you\u2019re below the radiator.",
        "Look for the drain plug (the white or black plastic wingnut) near the bottom corner or side of the radiator tank.",
        "Place a bucket underneath the drain plug so the coolant doesn\u2019t spill when you drain the radiator.",
        "Unscrew the drain plug and let the coolant flow into the bucket until your radiator is empty.",
        "Screw the drain plug back onto the tank when you\u2019re finished.",
        "Vehicle coolant can be toxic, so keep it away from children or pets.",
        "Don\u2019t drain the coolant unless your vehicle and engine are completely cool or else it could be extremely hot and cause burns.",
        "If your radiator doesn\u2019t have a drain plug, use a screwdriver to loosen the clamp around the lower radiator hose before pulling it out of place.",
        "Then, drain the coolant from the lower hose into the bucket.",
        "Disconnect the upper radiator hose from the engine.",
        "The thick black hose runs from the side of your radiator and attaches to the top or side of your engine block with a tube clamp.",
        "Use a screwdriver to loosen the nut on the tube clamp and then pull the hose off of the engine.",
        "Set the end of the hose aside for now so you can access the thermostat housing on your engine.",
        "Place a shop cloth or rag in the end of the hose to prevent dirt or debris from getting inside it.",
        "Remove the thermostat after disconnecting the thermostat housing from the engine.",
        "The thermostat housing is the blocky metal piece connected to your engine block that the hose was attached to.",
        "Use a socket wrench to loosen the bolts holding the housing in place, and set them aside so you don\u2019t lose them.",
        "Pull the housing off of the engine to expose the thermostat, which looks like a small metal cylinder with a spring and 2 metal rings around it.",
        "Grab the end of the thermostat and pull it out.",
        "If it\u2019s difficult to grab the thermostat by hand, use a pair of needle-nose pliers or a screwdriver to pry it out.",
        "The bolts for your thermostat housing may be different lengths.",
        "Make note of where each bolt went inside the housing so you can reattach it correctly later.",
        "Submerge the thermostat in a pot of water so it doesn\u2019t touch the bottom.",
        "Use a pot that\u2019s deep enough to completely submerge the thermostat in water.",
        "Fill the pot with water from your faucet and set it on a stove.",
        "Hold the top of the thermostat with a pair of tongs so it\u2019s underwater.",
        "Don\u2019t let the thermostat rest on the bottom of the pot since it could affect the temperature on the reading.",
        "You can also hang the thermostat on the side of the pot with a piece of string or metal clip.",
        "Heat the water until it reaches about 195\u2013220 \u00b0F (91\u2013104 \u00b0C).",
        "Turn your stove onto high heat and place a thermometer in the pot of water so you can record the temperature.",
        "Continue heating the water until it reaches 195\u2013220 \u00b0F (91\u2013104 \u00b0C), which is the temperature engines operate the best.",
        "Turn off the heat once your thermometer reads within the range.Tip: Look on the thermostat to see if it has an operating temperature listed.",
        "If it does, the thermostat should open once it reaches that temperature.",
        "Take the thermostat out of the pot to see if it\u2019s opened.",
        "Pull the thermostat out of the water with your tongs and set it on paper towels to dry it off.",
        "As the thermostat heats up, the spring should compress and the center ring will separate from the outer ring to make a gap in the middle.",
        "If the spring compresses and there\u2019s a gap, then the thermostat opened and works fine.",
        "If the thermostat doesn\u2019t have a gap between the circular metal pieces, then it\u2019s stuck closed and should be replaced.",
        "You can get replacement thermostats from an auto supply store or online.",
        "Make sure the thermostat matches the model vehicle you have."
