If you bought your dish from a TV service, for instance, you may have a hard time connecting to their competitor's satellites. Search for available satellites at https://www.lyngsat.com/. To differentiate between satellites, look at the names listed along with the coordinates. Tracking sites list the names, which usually include the owning company or the service they provide. If you bought a satellite service, it is possible to receive signals from satellites outside that service. Since you usually need to replace several parts, it's easier to get a new satellite instead. Try to pick a satellite close to your area. If you subscribe to a particular TV service, you will need to use the company's satellites. The biggest providers have multiple satellites."

Adjusting the elevation is usually pretty easy because of the labeled slot. Moving the bolt along the slot raises or lowers the dish.

Gradually move the arm about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) at a time until the signal quality is perfect. This part is easier if you are able to set up a TV close to the dish. If the TV is far away, have someone else stand near it and give you feedback. You may need to wait to adjust the LNB until you're done with the wiring. Take care of it before then if you're able so you don't have to keep climbing on the roof to make adjustments.

The clamp is little more than a flat piece of metal meant to hold the U-shaped rod in place. The adjustment panel has 3 different slots. Use the slots to reposition the satellite dish. In most cases, the middle slot is best for setting the dish at the proper angle. Bolt the antenna bracket to the back of the satellite dish. You have a couple more bolts to add to finish the bulk of the assembly, and this is one of the easiest parts to finish. Line up the holes on the plate with the holes on the back of the dish. Stick the longest bolts you have, usually 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) in length, through the front of the dish. Then, place a washer and nut on the end of each bolt, tightening it with your wrench. Make sure all of the components stay bolted together. If they feel shaky, carefully separate them and tighten the bolts. Install the LNB on the end of the LNB arm. One last component, the LNB, controls the dish's functionality. First, slide the handle of the LNB onto the open end of the arm. Secure it with nuts and bolts, then take the LNB out of the box. It looks almost like a round speaker or flashlight. Position it on the handle, facing it toward the dish before bolting it in place. Some stronger satellites have up to 3 LNBs designed to feed a stronger satellite signal into your home. You may need to loosen the LNB later to readjust it and improve the signal quality. Connect the adjustment panel on the dish to the wall mount. Fit the dish onto the open end of the mount. If everything is attached correctly, it will fit inside or behind the adjustment panel. You can then add the 1 or 2 remaining bolts to fasten these pieces together. If the dish looks good, then you're ready to position it to communicate with a satellite. These parts can attach in a variety of different ways depending on what satellite you have, so be sure to refer to the owner's manual. If the mount is meant to attach to the back of the panel, your satellite will also come with a pair of clips. Position them behind the mount, then add the screws through them to bind the parts together. Pointing the Dish at a Satellite Select a satellite you wish to connect to. Pick a satellite that is in range of your particular dish. There are numerous satellites out there, but dishes cannot get signals from all of them. If you bought your dish from a TV service, for instance, you may have a hard time connecting to their competitor's satellites. Search for available satellites at https://www.lyngsat.com/. To differentiate between satellites, look at the names listed along with the coordinates. Tracking sites list the names, which usually include the owning company or the service they provide. If you bought a satellite service, it is possible to receive signals from satellites outside that service. Since you usually need to replace several parts, it's easier to get a new satellite instead. Try to pick a satellite close to your area. If you subscribe to a particular TV service, you will need to use the company's satellites. The biggest providers have multiple satellites. Find the satellite's location before positioning the dish. You're going to need to point the dish in the correct direction, then angle it up at the sky. This is difficult to do if you don't know the satellite's positioning. Fortunately, satellites don't move much, so you can use a positioning database to adjust your dish. Use a site like https://www.dishpointer.com/. Type in your address and choose a satellite you wish to connect to. The site will give you the precise positioning needed for your dish to receive the signal. You won't be able to receive a signal from a distant satellite. Don't expect to reach a Chinese satellite if you're in North America, for instance. Use the azimuth number to rotate the satellite. Have a compass handy and locate true north first. Then, look at the azimuth number and find where that is on the compass. North is considered to be 0 degrees, east is 90 degrees, south is 180 degrees, and west is 270 degrees. Rotate the satellite dish horizontally until it points in the correct direction. For example, if you need to point the dish to 225 degrees, find north first. Then, turn the satellite southwest from there. Move the dish vertically to adjust its elevation. Once you know the elevation needed to reach the satellite, go behind the dish. Examine the end of the mount where it connects to the dish. You will see a bolt inside a slot labeled by degrees, usually 10 to 60. Loosen the bolt by twisting it counterclockwise, then reposition the dish to the proper elevation. Adjusting the elevation is usually pretty easy because of the labeled slot. Moving the bolt along the slot raises or lowers the dish. For instance, if the dish requires a 53-degree elevation, it will point up into the sky almost as much as it possibly can. Slide the loosened bolt back toward the 60-degree marker. Adjust the dish's polarization until you get a clear signal. The final part that needs to be adjusted is LNB, responsible for receiving and sending the signal into your home. It is usually an arm on the front that points toward the dish. Test out the signal quality by hooking the dish up to the receiver and a TV, then loosen the connecting nut on the arm by turning it counterclockwise with a wrench. Gradually move the arm about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) at a time until the signal quality is perfect. This part is easier if you are able to set up a TV close to the dish. If the TV is far away, have someone else stand near it and give you feedback. You may need to wait to adjust the LNB until you're done with the wiring. Take care of it before then if you're able so you don't have to keep climbing on the roof to make adjustments. The LNB can sometimes be controlled by turning a mount part on the back of the dish left or right. Wiring the Dish Drill a \u20442 in (1.3 cm) hole in the roof if you need one. Check your home first for a previously-used cable opening. The dish's cable needs its own little space to enter your home and hook up to your TV. Unless your home is in the process of being built, drilling a single hole is the easiest way to do this. Position your TV and the satellite receiver nearby to prepare for the connection. If you're installing the satellite on the ground, dig a trench to bury the cable so it doesn't get damaged. It needs to be below the frost line, the lowest point that freezes in winter, which is about 3 in (7.6 cm) deep. Run a coaxial cable from the LNB to the receiver. Get a basic RG6 coaxial cable and look for a slot on the LNB. Plug it in, then plug the opposite end into the \u201cSat in\u201d port on your receiver. Make sure the receiver is positioned close to the satellite to ensure the cable can reach it. You can buy a cable online, from hardware stores, and also from electronics suppliers. TV service providers will also give you one when you buy a satellite from them. The coaxial cable sometimes connects to the back of the satellite. Usually, though, it plugs directly into the LNB. Connect an HDMI cable to the receiver and your TV. Plug one end of the HDMI cable into the back of the receiver, then stretch it to the TV. Most modern TVs have a couple of HDMI slots, so choose whichever one you prefer. Once the cord is in place, your TV will be able to receive the satellite signal. Turn on the TV to see if it works. Some satellites and receivers don't connect this way. The receiver may plug directly into the TV instead. Consult a wiring guide for specific instructions on how to connect the satellite, receiver, and your TV. If you bought the satellite from a TV service provider, they will also provide a wiring guide. Turn on the TV to test the signal. Press the satellite button if your remote has one or navigate to the settings menu. You should be able to get a picture right away. If the signal quality is poor, make sure you positioned the satellite dish correctly. Adjust it to get the clearest possible signal! You can check the settings menu to get an idea of where the satellite dish is.Take note of the azimuth, elevation, and LNB numbers and compare them to the satellite's location.",
