Seek medical care right away if this has never happened to you before, if your lips are severely swollen, if it affects your breathing, or if your throat swells. If you've had similar allergic reactions in the past and know that these are mild symptoms, take an antihistamine, and keep your inhaler or epinephrine shot nearby. If the reaction was caused by an insect bite, seek emergency services immediately. If you're not sure what caused the swelling, take precautions as though it were an allergic reaction. In many cases, the cause of the allergic reaction is never discovered. \"Mild\" cases can still last several days. Visit a doctor if the swelling hasn't disappeared by then."
