Cutting your vegetables mimics the effects of blanching and stops the enzyme reaction in the vegetable that causes flavor and color loss. Leafy greens include kale, lettuce, arugula, and spinach. Use caution as you chop your vegetables. Keep your fingers tucked underneath your hand with your knuckles facing the knife to avoid an injury."
