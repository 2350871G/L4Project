                    "description": "Chop your ingredients into manageable, bite-size pieces. Cutting them up makes them easier to eat and to handle, and it also helps them cook faster and more evenly. Different foods will need to be cut differently in order to get the best taste. Carrots, for example, are very fibrous, so you'd do well to julienne them before saut\u00e9ing. Greens like spinach, on the other hand, will wilt very quickly and therefore won't need to be cut. Try to cut the ingredients at an equal size. Ingredients chopped down to the same size will cook evenly. Ingredients that are chopped at wildly different sizes will cook unevenly, producing some food that is over- or undercooked. It sounds simple, but it's incredibly important."

                    "description": "Because you're saut\u00e9ing, you want you pan to get hot before putting anything in it. This is important for several reasons:\nA colder pan has hot spots. Hot spots are places on the pan where it is inordinately hotter than elsewhere. This can cause uneven cooking, leaving you with some ingredients that are overcooked and others than are undercooked. As you continue to heat the pan, the heat distributes itself evenly over the entire pan, producing a better final product. Cold proteins on cold pans will dry out the proteins before they even begin to cook. Put a cold piece of chicken on a cold pan and your chicken will likely be much drier than had you started with the pan piping hot. Needless to say, dry food isn't ideal."

                    "description": "The amount will vary by recipe, and the type of fat you want to choose will affect the final dish being served. Here's a quick primer on whether to choose butter or oil as your fat:\nButter has a smoking point of 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C), while most oils have a higher smoking point (375-450 \u00b0F). This means that butter burns easier than oils. If you're worried about burning your fat while you cook, opt for oils. On the other hand, butter leaves a better \"fond\" (brown crust) and richer taste; if you're cooking over less heat, opt for butter. One way to solve the flashpoint dilemma of butter is to use clarified butter or ghee. Clarified butter is simply butter with the milk solids removed. Because the milk solids are what end up burning, removing them from the butter should allow you to cook it at higher temperatures. One caution using olive oil. While many chefs prefer the taste of olive oil over other oils, it actually has a lower smoking point than other oils. For this reason, it may be beneficial to cook with a neutral oil like avocado oil (smoke point 480 \u00baF) and then add olive oil at the very end for taste."
