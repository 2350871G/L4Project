Cut evenly all the way around the bottom of the shirt to accomplish this. Each t-shirt will be different depending on the size and how it fits on your own body. Cut away a smaller amount than you think you want, then try it on. Make additional cuts if you want it shorter, and keep trying it on to check the length. You can also create a pattern at the hem of your t-shirt, whether or not you cut it shorter for a crop top. Try cutting strips for a fringe hemline, or cut shapes like diamonds just above the hemline for a cute cutout look."

Cut along the arm hole seams for a regular tank top, or further down the sides of the shirt for a wide-armed muscle tee look. You may also want to cut a wider neckline for a classic tank, but this is not necessary. For a muscle tee, you can cut in a straight or slightly angled line down from the shoulder to the side of the shirt. Try it on between cuts to make sure you like how much of the side is open. You can also cut all the way down through the bottom hemline of the shirt and tie the ends together at the bottom for a cute side-tie look."

To make sure the front and back of your neckline are symmetrical, fold the shirt so that the shoulder seams line up and the neckband is folded evenly on itself. Then cut below the band, following the original curve of it. Create a v-neck neckline by folding the shirt in the same way with the shoulder seams lined up.
