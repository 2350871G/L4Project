You could cut out squares, rectangles, triangles, or even differently-sized cards, depending on your taste. Use a pen or finely-tipped marker to write the name of a guest on each card. Card stock works well for this kind of project because it\u2019s thicker and less likely to bend or crease. You can find lots of different colors of card stock at your local craft store.

Cut out about 100 of each shape for a garland that\u2019s 6 to 7 feet (1.8 to 2.1 m) long. To make this project easier, purchase a punch in the shape you want from your local craft store. For a cute Valentine\u2019s Day option, cut out heart shapes from red and pink papers, stitch them together, and then hang them from the ceiling so that it looks like hearts are flowing down.
