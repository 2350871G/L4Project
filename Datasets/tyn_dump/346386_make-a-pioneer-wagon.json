If your box is too tall, trim it down a little. How much you trim down from the top of the box depends on how big the box is to begin with. Use your best judgement. You can even use a milk carton. Cut out one of the side panels, then trim the walls down so that they aren't so tall."

Press the cut out shapes onto the matching sides of the box. If you don't have brown construction paper, you can use brown cardstock or even a brown paper bag. You can cover the bottom of the box, or you can leave it blank. It won't be visible in the end.
