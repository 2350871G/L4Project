        "Air bubbles prevent the clutch from engaging properly and are often caused by leaks.",
        "If you have replaced the clutch fluid recently, that could also cause air to get into the reservoir.",
        "Drive the car to see if you can shift gears while operating the clutch.",
        "Starting with the car in first gear, press down on the clutch to build up speed.",
        "Press it again when the engine reaches about 2,000 RPM and shift into second gear.",
        "Watch for anything out of the ordinary, such as the vehicle lurching, a stuck clutch, or a grinding noise.",
        "Visit a mechanic right away to solve most of these problems.",
        "For something like a stuck clutch, check the fluid level first.",
        "A drained reservoir will prevent the clutch from working.",
        "Transmission problems are very serious and difficult to repair at home.",
        "Don\u2019t ignore signs like grinding gears or a clutch that won\u2019t work at all.",
        "Drain and replace the clutch fluid if it looks dark.. Fresh clutch fluid has a clear yellow coloring.",
        "It darkens, turning red or black, over time.",
        "If the fluid looks dirty, bleed it from the clutch valve underneath your vehicle.",
        "If it still looks clear, simply top off the reservoir tank as needed with new fluid.",
        "Bleeding the valve requires you to jack up the vehicle\u2019s front end and get under it.",
        "Once you find the valve, you attach a rubber hose to it and press the clutch to drive out the fluid.",
        "However, keep the tank full by adding new fluid after every couple of presses.",
        "If you\u2019re uncertain about doing this on your own, contact a mechanic to have them deal with the clutch fluid.",
        "Jacking up a car is dangerous when it isn\u2019t done properly.",
        "Inspect the fluid reservoir and surrounding components for leaks.",
        "Like any other car parts, the components responsible for operating the clutch wear out over time.",
        "Open the engine bay and examine the clutch fluid reservoir.",
        "Have a friend press the clutch pedal down while you keep an eye on the fluid level.",
        "Check the reservoir tank and the parts around it for leaked fluid.",
        "If you notice a leak, get an identical replacement part or take the vehicle to a professional right away.",
        "You may not notice small leaks right away.",
        "One easy way to spot hidden leaks is by noting the fluid level, then checking it again after several days.",
        "If it has changed by a noticeable amount, then your vehicle needs repairs.",
        "Look at the clutch lines and slave valve underneath the car for leaks.",
        "The slave cylinder is a small component located above the transmission on your engine.",
        "To find it, follow the cables running from the clutch reservoir to the engine.",
        "Have a friend press the clutch pedal a few times while you watch for the slave cylinder to move.",
        "Check it for leaks or bubbles as well.",
        "If the cylinder doesn\u2019t move, it has to be replaced.",
        "Take the vehicle to a mechanic.",
        "Leaks can be fixed by replacing parts.",
        "Have a mechanic do it if you are unable to do it on your own.",
        "If you do it on your own, you will need to bleed out the clutch valve afterward."
