Avoid using heavy fabrics like velvet or wool, as these are too heavy to be held up properly using liquid starch. If you pick a patterned fabric, you'll need to match the design up along the seam wherever there is a break in the fabric.

        "Then move onto applying the liquid starch both underneath and over each subsequent panel.",
        "Aim to use enough liquid starch so that it soaks through the fabric and onto the wall.",
        "Let the fabric dry for approximately 24 hours.",
        "You need to wait until all of the liquid starch has dried before you continue working on the wall.",
        "Run your hand over the fabric to check if it\u2019s dry.",
        "Keep the windows open if possible or turn on a fan to help speed up the process.",
        "The length of time that it takes for the fabric to dry depends on the temperature and humidity.",
        "Finishing the Edges and the Corners Remove the masking tape when the fabric is completely dry.",
        "Get a step ladder and begin at the top corner of the fabric.",
        "Gently peel off the masking tape and unfold the edges of the fabric.",
        "Work your way over the whole wall until all of the masking tape is gone.",
        "Add liquid starch to any loose areas with a paintbrush.",
        "Some areas around the trim, corners, and baseboards of the wall may have loose fabric.",

        "Remember to smooth it out in between each coat of liquid starch to prevent wrinkles.",
        "Trim the excess fabric away with a utility knife when it\u2019s dry.",
        "Wait for all of the additional liquid starch to dry again before you begin trimming the fabric.",
        "Run the utility knife along each straight edge of the wall, such as the trim, the corner, and the baseboards, to cut away the excess fabric.",
        "It\u2019s important to wait until the fabric is fully dry before cutting it, as sometimes it can shrink slightly when the liquid starch is added.",

        "Fill up a bucket with warm water and get a clean sponge.",
        "Saturate the sponge in the water and then wring it out slightly.",
