Look for sheepskin detergent where you bought your sheepskin, at a furrier, or online. A regular wool detergent may damage sheepskin. Check the label on your detergent to make sure it says it is safe to use on sheepskin. You can also use a very mild clothing detergent. Try a detergent made for delicates or one that is dye-free and fragrance-free. If you are unsure if it's mild enough, test the detergent on a small section of the sheepskin first. Avoid detergents that contain enzymes or bleach, and do not use a fabric softener."
