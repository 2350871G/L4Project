        "Put the camera on a tripod to get a steady image.",
        "Always use a tripod when you are shooting fireworks, as this will ensure you get a clear, high quality image.",
        "Set up the camera, or your smartphone, on a tripod in the shooting location.",
        "Make sure the shutter speed, ISO, and aperture have already been set, as you do not want to have to touch the camera too much once you start shooting.",

        "Get a remote shutter release to avoid touching the camera.",
        "The remote shutter release attaches to your camera and is controlled by a small remote you hold in your hand.",
        "This feature is ideal when you are shooting fireworks, as touching your camera while shooting can cause the images to appear blurry or unclear.",
        "You can buy a remote shutter release at your local camera store or online.",
        "Focus the camera on a distant object near where the fireworks are going off.",
        "Look into the lense and adjust the focus manually so it is on an object that is fairly far away, just beside or in front of where the fireworks are going to explode.",
        "This will then ensure the fireworks appear in focus when they enter the frame.",
        "You can also try zooming out or in and focusing on the fireworks to get a different perspective.",
        "Your wide or telephoto zoom lense should make doing this fairly easy.",
        "Frame the fireworks with people, objects, or a landscape.",
        "Use your surroundings to make the photographs more interesting and unique.",
        "Try placing a landmark in one corner of the frame and focusing on it as the fireworks go off.",
        "You can also focus on the skyline just below the fireworks to get a nice landscape in the foreground.",
        "Including people watching the fireworks can also make the photographs more interesting.",
        "Try shooting at a lower angle to capture people in the foreground or background of the image.",
        "Reduce the shutter speed if the fireworks appear blurry or unclear.",
        "If you notice your images are coming out blurry or unclear, it may be because your shutter speed is not slow enough.",
        "Bump it down 1-2 speeds so the lense stays open longer and you can capture the full effect of the fireworks.",
        "You may need to also play around with the aperture setting when you reduce the shutter speed to find the right balance.",
        "Use \u201cbulb mode\u201d to experiment with exposure.",
        "To do this, press the shutter down as the fireworks are launching.",
        "Continue to hold the shutter for several seconds until the burst fades and then slowly let it go.",
        "This allows you to create a long exposure that will capture the fireworks as it explodes.",
        "Use a remote shutter release to do \u201cbulb mode\u201d as this will prevent you from touching the camera and causing it to shift or move, which can ruin the photograph."
