Positioning them inside glass terrariums or globes is a popular and attractive solution. You can also mount an air plant to a surface permanently with hot glue or super glue. If you don\u2019t want to use glue, tie the plants in place with fishing wire. Try mounting your air plant on a piece of driftwood or coral using hot glue to create a pretty display. Decide where you want to position the air plant on the chosen material, apply a small amount of hot glue to the area, and press the underside of the air plant clump into the glue. Hold the plant in place for 10-15 seconds so the glue can set."
