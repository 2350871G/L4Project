If you\u2019re making ornaments or other crafts, you might want slices closer to 0.125 inches (0.32 cm). Think about what thickness you need. When using a bandsaw to make thin, small slices from a tree branch, it's best to use a branch that is 6 inches (15 cm) or less in diameter. Different band saws have different capacities, however, so you may want to check the product manual first."

        "Measure the thickness with a tape measure.",
        "Mark the trunk in multiple places with a permanent marker so that you can line the saw blade up at those points.",
        "You can also try wrapping a piece of masking tape around the tree trunk and use that as your cutting guide.",
        "Hold the chainsaw firmly with both hands and turn it on.",
        "Hold the saw 4 inches (10 cm) to 5 inches (13 cm) above the tree and line it up with the marks you made.",
        "Wrap your left thumb around the front handle of the saw's grip.",
        "Turn the saw on and slowly lower it down to the tree trunk.",
        "Wrapping your left thumb around the grip will allow you to keep the saw under control if you experience any kickback.",
        "Glide the chainsaw blade through the wood slowly.",
        "Apply a small amount of pressure as you push downward through the tree trunk with the saw.",
        "Go slow and hold the chainsaw as firmly as possible so that your cut is clean and straight.",
        "You don't need to press down with a lot of force; let the blade do most of the work while you guide it.",
        "Move the slice out of the way and repeat, if desired.",
        "If you only want 1 slice, turn off the chainsaw and you're done!",
        "If you want multiple slices, turn off the chainsaw and move the first slice out of the way.",
        "Measure and mark your new slice and repeat the same actions.",
        "Sanding and Drying Your Slices Use a wire or nylon brush around the edges of each slice.",
        "Brush around the edges where the bark is still attached to remove loose bark.",
        "Take care to remove all loose or broken pieces of bark from the edges of each slice.",
        "Sand both flat sides of the slice if you want a smooth finish.",
        "For table tops, a relatively smooth finish is desirable.",
        "Use a sanding block to smooth away any rough and uneven areas on both sides of the slice.",
        "Once you're happy with the smoothness, brush away any sawdust clinging to the surface.",
        "Use a 120 to 220 grit sanding block for the smoothest finish.",
        "Wipe down the slice thoroughly with a damp cloth.",
        "Lightly dampen a soft cloth with tap water.",
        "Use it to wipe the flat surfaces of the slices first, then run the damp cloth around the edges of each slice to remove any lingering sawdust and loose bark.",
        "Let the wood air-dry completely before proceeding.",
        "You are only using a dampened cloth to wipe the wood down, so it shouldn't take longer than 30 minutes to dry.",
        "Touch the surface with your fingers to test it before proceeding.",
        "Preheat your oven to 250 \u00b0F (121 \u00b0C).",
        "Make sure nothing is inside your oven.",
        "Set the dial to 250 \u00b0F (121 \u00b0C) and wait 10 minutes for it to heat up.",
        "Line your slices up on a foil-lined baking sheet.",
        "Tear off a sheet of regular aluminum foil and spread it over a baking sheet.",
        "Position your wood slices on the lined baking sheet so that none of them are touching.",
        "Depending on how many slices you made, you may need to do this in batches.",
        "If you are working with large slices that don't fit into an oven, you'll need to use a kiln instead.",
        "Bake the slices in the oven for about 60 minutes.",
        "Once the oven is fully preheated, slide the baking sheet into the oven at the center of the main rack.",
        "Close the oven door.",
        "Baking your slices will dry the wood as well as make sure there are no critters still living inside.",
        "Drying the wood is necessary if you plan to paint your slices and/or seal them with a clear coat."
