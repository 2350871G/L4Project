    "text": " Knitting a Simple Scarf Choose your house colors. You will need equal amounts of both colors. Choose yarn that is the same weight and texture, and preferably the same brand. The house colors are as listed below:\nGryffindor: Red and Gold\nHufflepuff: Black and Yellow\nRavenclaw: Blue and Bronze (books) or Blue and Silver (films)\nSlytherin: Green and Silver Cast on 20 - 25 stitches with your first color. It does not matter which color you start with; they will even out in the end. This pattern will create a simple block-style scarf, with equal sized stripes. Knit 20 rows. You can knit the stockinette stitch, which is alternating rows of purl and knit stitches. This will give you a knit texture on one side, and a bumpy (purl) texture on the other. You can also knit the garter stitch, which is knitting every stitch on every row. This will give you a bumpy (purl) texture on both sides. Change colors to the second color. Cut your yarn down to about 6 inches (15.24 centimeters). Pull out your second color and have it ready to knit with. Leave behind a 4 to 6-inch (10.16 to 15.24-centimeter) tail. Knit 20 rows using your second color. Once again, you can do a stockinette stitch or a garter stitch. Which ever you choose, make sure that it matches the one you used for your first color. Continue alternating colors and knitting 20 rows. Keep doing this until the scarf is the length you want it to be. Most scarves are about 60 inches (152.4 centimeters) long. Cast and bind off. Knit two stitches onto your right needle. Use your left needle to pull the first stitch over the second stitch and slip it of off your needle. Keep knitting a stitch, and using your knitting needle to pull the previous stitch off the needle, until you have one stitch left. Tie the yarn off. Once you reach the end, cut your yarn down to 6 inches (15.24 centimeters). Thread it back through the last stitch, then back through the loop you made. Once you have a tight knot, use a yarn needle or a tapestry needle to weave the tail back into the scarf. Cut off any excess yarn. Tie the tail ends and weave them in. Go back over your scarf where you had the color changes. Tie the tail ends together, then weave them back into the body of the scarf. You can do this with a yarn needle or a tapestry needle. Cut off any excess yarn. Knitting a Fancy Scarf Choose your house colors. This design uses a base color and an accent color. The first color listed is your main house color, and the second color is your accent house color. Gryffindor: Red and Gold\nHufflepuff: Black and Yellow\nRavenclaw: Blue and Bronze (books) or Blue and Silver (films)\nSlytherin: Green and Silver Cast on 20 to 25 stitches with the main house color. This design will create alternating thick and thin stripes. Your first stripe will be a thick one, using your main house color. The main house colors are listed below as such:\nGryffindor: Red\nHufflepuff: yellow\nRavenclaw: Blue\nSlytherin: Green Knit 20 rows. You can use a stockinette stitch or a garter stitch. The stockinette stitch is alternating rows of knits and purls. It is knit on one side, and bumpy on the other. The garter stitch is knitting on each row. It will give you a bumpy texture on both sides. Change colors to the accent house color. Once you reach the end of the row, cut your yarn down to 4 to 6 inches (10.16 to 15.24 centimeters). Set the yarn aside, and pick up your accent color. The accent colors are as listed below:\nGryffindor: Gold\nHufflepuff: Black\nRavenclaw: Bronze (books) or Silver (films)\nSlytherin: Silver(films) Knit two rows. Use the same stitch as you did for your main house color: stockinette or garter. Be sure to leave behind a 4 to 6-inch (10.16 to 15.24-centimeter) tail when you start knitting. Change back to the main house color and knit for two rows. Once you reach the end of the second row, cut your accent color down to 4 to 6 inches (10.16 to 15.24 centimeters). Pick up your accent color. Knit two more rows with your accent color. Once again, leave a 4 to 6-inch (10.16 to 15.24-centimeter) tail at the start of the first row and the end of the second one. This will create a distinctive double-stripe seen on the house scarves in the later films. Continue knitting until you have the scarf as long as you want it. Most scarves are about 60 inches (152.4 centimeters) long. Repeat the pattern listed below:\n20 rows in your main color\n2 rows in your accent color\n2 rows in your main color\n2 rows in your accent color Cast and bind off. Knit two stitches onto your right needle. Use your left needle to pull the first stitch over the second stitch. Slip that first stitch of off your right needle. Keep knitting a stitch, then using your knitting needle to pull the previous stitch off the needle. Stop when you have one stitch left. Tie the yarn off. Once you reach the of the row and have one stitch left, cut your yarn down to 4 to 6 inches (10.16 to 15.24 centimeters). Thread it through the last stitch, then back through the loop.

Go back over your scarf where you had the color changes. Tie the tail ends together, then weave them back into the body of the scarf. You can do this with a yarn needle or a tapestry needle.

Flannel will also work. Avoid using fabric that frays. Gryffindor: Red & Gold\nHufflepuff: Yellow & Black\nRavenclaw: Blue & Bronze (books) or Blue & Silver (films)\nSlytherin: Green and Silver Cut your fabric into strips. The strips need to be 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) wide and 9 inches (22.86 centimeters) long. You will need 9 to 10 strips of each color. Pin the strips together. Pin the strips with the right sides facing together, the long edges touching. When you are done, you should have a long strip that is 9 inches (22.86 centimeters) wide and about 60 inches (152.4 centimeters) long. Sew the strips together using a \u00bc-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance. Use a thread and bobbin color that matches one of your colors. Pull out the pins as you sew. Press the seams open. Use an iron to go over each of the seams you just made, and press them open. This will help reduce bulk for your scarf. Fold the scarf in half lengthwise. Make sure that the wrong sides are sticking out and the right sides are sticking on. Pin the scarf along the edges, if necessary. Sew along the scarf's edge, excluding the first and last stripe. Use a \u00bc-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance. Start sewing at the bottom of the second stripe, and stop sewing at the top of the second to last stripe. Do not sew across the narrow ends of the scarf. Backstitch at the start and end of your sewing to keep the stitching from coming undone. Trim off the tail ends of the thread. Cut a fringe into the first and last stripes. Cut some slits into the first and last stripes, \u00bd-inch (1.27-centimeters) apart. Try to cut through both layers of fabric. When you reach the folded edge, simply cut it apart. Turn the scarf inside out. Make sure that you get all of the fringes out as well. For a neater finish, press the scarf flat with an iron. Focus on the side edges. Sew across the ends of the scarf, right above the fringes. Sew across the top of the first stripe, and the bottom of the last stripe. Use a thread and bobbin color that matches the fabric.",
