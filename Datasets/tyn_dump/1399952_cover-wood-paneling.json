Dirty walls may need a commercial degreaser to prepare the surface for paint, followed by a thorough water rinse. Degreasers can be dangerous to skin and lungs, so follow label instructions carefully. TSP (trisodium phosphate) is an effective choice, but it is banned in some areas for environmental reasons. If you want an environmentally friendly cleaner, you might try using a brand like Simple Green."

You can paint over the panels without filling, but the grooves will still be visible. If your panels are solid lumber (not plywood), prime the area with a joint compound (such as the kind you would use for drywall) before filling the grooves. If you don't, any filling you put in the grooves will eventually crack or fall out."

This is faster, but you'll have to work one panel at a time, priming as soon as the deglosser dries to the correct consistency. Check product label for details. If you cleaned the panels with TSP, you might be able to skip this step. An additional light sanding or deglossing is still a good idea. If you do not sand away the finish, you should use an oil-based primer instead, as this will be easier for the paint to adhere to."
