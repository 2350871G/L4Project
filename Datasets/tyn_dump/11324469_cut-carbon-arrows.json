A rotary cutter is a handheld multitool that spins quickly to cut through materials.

Position the hose of a shop vacuum behind the rotary blade. Cutting carbon arrows creates dust that can cause irritation if you breathe it in, so it\u2019s easiest to vacuum it immediately to prevent it from spreading. Set the end of the hose on your work surface so it\u2019s directly behind the rotary cutter\u2019s blade. Connect the other end of the hose to the intake port on your vacuum.

If the blade has difficulty cutting the arrow straight through, try rotating the arrow while you hold it against the blade to make it easier. Cutting Shafts with an Arrow Saw Attach a shop vacuum hose to the port on the back of an arrow saw. Many arrow saws have a port on the back where you can attach a vacuum hose to collect dust.
