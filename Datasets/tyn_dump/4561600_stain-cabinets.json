If you don\u2019t take all the hinges and knobs off, the stain won\u2019t penetrate the entire area, and you may have inconsistencies and bubbles in your finish. Keep all the knobs and hinges in sealable plastic bags with the screws that attach them. Label all of the doors and hardware with a strip of painter\u2019s tape and the exact location. Write in marker. Purchase some stain colors to test. Choose a bottom door and sand down the back to remove the original finish. Then, apply stain in several coats to adjoining sections so that you can see what color works best. Remove the cabinet bases and boxes themselves if you are in the process of a whole room remodel. If you can do this project outside or in a garage with a drop cloth, you will reduce your mess and make the inside of your house a lot more tolerable during the project. Sanding the Finish Open your windows. Buy a ventilation mask and wear safety goggles. Some cabinets are treated with formaldehyde, which shouldn\u2019t be breathed in as it is sanded off. Purchase a small power sander or several sanding blocks in both medium and fine grit. Start with 100 to 120 grit sandpaper and repeat with 200 grit sandpaper to remove the existing finish. Sand the doors, drawers and bases to remove the glossy sealant. Use a shop vac to get rid of the majority of the dust. Then, follow up by wiping the cabinets with a tack cloth. Staining the Cabinets Tape down drop cloths around the base of your cabinets if you are unable to remove them. Tape off counters and walls with painter\u2019s tape. Keep cleaning wipes nearby in case of spills or mistakes. Buy cloth with which to apply the stain. You can also cut up old t-shirts or use old tube socks. Choose white fabric or fabric with very little dye left in it. Apply the stain by dipping the cloth in it and applying a thin coat. Start with the bases of the cabinets. Then, move onto the doors and drawers. It\u2019s better to apply several thin coats than one thick coat, because the wood must slowly absorb the liquid or gel stain. Allow it to dry according to package directions. Then, repeat with a second and third coat. Sealing the Cabinets Apply a polyurethane topcoat with foam brushes.  Allow it to dry, and then apply another coat.  Wait 24 hours to several days to cure the finish.  Reassemble your cabinets. Screw the doors and doorknobs into the bases. Keep the area well ventilated for several weeks.",
