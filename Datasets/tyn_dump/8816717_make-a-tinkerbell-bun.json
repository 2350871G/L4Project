If you have bangs, exclude these from the ponytail. You can style them later to create Tinkerbell's poofy bangs. Slide a bun maker that matches you hair color onto your ponytail. The bun maker should be covering the hair tie, and you hair should be sticking out through the middle of the bun maker. Use a bun maker that is proportionate to you. If you have long, thick hair, use a large one. If you have very thin hair (or styling a child's hair), use a small one. Spread your hair around the bun maker to cover it up. Use your hands to smooth your hair down evenly onto the bun maker. Make sure that there are no gaps showing. If you can see the bun maker through your hair, you might want to switch to a smaller size. Slide another hair tie over the bun maker. This will cinch your hair under the bun maker, creating the perfect bun look. If you need to, shift your hair around so that it covers the bun maker completely. It is best to use a hair tie that matches your hair color. Twist the ends of your hair around the bun for a neater touch. Take a small strand of hair and twist it into a rope. Add another small strand to the rope and twist again. Continue adding strands and twisting, working your way around the bun. Tuck the tail end of the rope under the bun, and secure it with bobby pins. If you plan on making false bangs, sweep all of your hair towards your forehead instead. Secure it under the bun with bobby pins so that it stays in place. Wrap a green ribbon around the base of the bun. Tie the ends of the ribbon into a bow at the back of the bun. The exact shade of green does not matter, but it should match your Tinkerbell costume. If you don't have a Tinkerbell costume, go for a bright, spring green.
