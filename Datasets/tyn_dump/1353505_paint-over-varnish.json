                    "description": "Fine-grit sandpaper ranges from 120- to 220-grit. Use a sander for an effortless sanding option, or sand the surface by hand if there are intricate spots or details. Continue sanding in small, circular motions until the surface of your table is smooth and level. Doing this etches the surface, making it easier for the paint to stick. Cover your mouth and nose with a facemask to avoid breathing in the dust and debris as you do this. For an extra-smooth finish, sand the surface with medium-grit (60- to 80-grit) sandpaper after you finish with the fine-grit sandpaper. This is helpful if your wooden surface is very damaged or uneven.

Whenever you paint over something that has a clear oil based finish on it, you have to rough it up so the paint will stick. If it\u2019s a big flat surface, you can use standard 220 grit for the whole thing. If it\u2019s small or has a lot of curves and edges, you\u2019ll want to use a finer grit.\u201d"
