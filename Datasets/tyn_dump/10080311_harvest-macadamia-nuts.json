When the weather is dry, collect your nuts less often\u2014every 1 to 2 months. Wet weather is more likely to cause mold, germination, and rat or pig damage. Always make it a top priority to get your nuts inside during this weather. Healthy macadamia trees begin bearing nuts after 6 to 7 years. They will produce around 30 to 50 pounds (14 to 23 kg) of nuts by 10 years of age. This amount gradually increases as your tree ages from this time."
