        "This is so you can slip it on once your costume is ready.",
        "Create the fins.",
        "Take your green fabric and lay the end down on top of the shiny turquoise blue fabric.",
        "Trace around the bottom of the green fabric, where the fins are, onto the blue fabric.",
        "Then cut the fins out of the blue fabric.",
        "Sew the blue fabric on to the green.",
        "Cut a split into the fins.",
        "Now you need to cut a split into the bottom of the tail so that you\u2019ll be able to walk.",
        "Cut the split right up the middle of the fins, starting at the bottom, up to your knees.",
        "This creates an opening for your feet and bottom part of your legs, so that you can walk in the costume.",
        "You can cut the split just at the bottom of the fins, so it does not show your legs.",
        "Sew the elastic band at the top of the fins.",
        "You\u2019ll do this right where the green tail meets the blue fins.",
        "Sew it all the way around.",
        "This allows you to slip the costume bottom on, and the bottom of the tail will cling at the bottom, resembling Ariel\u2019s tail.",
        "Making The Bottom Option 2 Gather your materials.",
        "To make Ariel\u2019s tail you\u2019ll need 1 large piece of green fabric that has some stretch to it.",
        "Spandex is a good choice.",
        "Check out material intended for dancewear - you can find some really fun material, like a deep green fabric covered in green sequins and other sparkly things that would be great for Ariel.",
        "You\u2019ll also need a sewing machine, green thread and scissors.",
        "Wrap the green material around your waist.",
        "Adjust it until you have the ideal fit for you.",
        "Make sure that, once wrapped around your waist, the material extends beyond your feet by about 6 inches.",
        "Pull it close to your legs all the way down, stopping at your heels.",
        "You can stop at your calves rather than your heels if you want a costume that's a bit easier to move around in.",
        "Pin the garment in place from the heel to the waist.",
        "Before pinning it, make sure it fits you exactly how you want it to.",
        "You now have the foundation of the tail there.",
        "The green material will drift out in front of your feet about 6 inches, with the material gathered in at the heels in the back, creating a tail fin effect.",
        "Sew the garment together from the heels to the waist.",
        "You can keep the material on while you have a friend hand sew it all the way up, or you can take it off and use a sewing machine to stitch it together.",
        "Completing the Costume Get a wig with long red hair.",
        "Ariel\u2019s hair is very long, red and wavy.",
        "You\u2019ll want to style the hair to be tousled but pretty.",
        "Use bobby pins to secure it to your head.",
        "If you have a hard time finding one, you can definitely order one inexpensively on the internet.",
        "It would be cute to add some little embellishments in the hair, like small barrettes with starfish on them.",
        "You could also spray the hair lightly with the canned glitter made specifically for hair \u2013 it would be pretty and look like water droplets.",
        "Do Ariel\u2019s makeup look.",
        "You\u2019ll want to use red lipstick in a shade almost identical to the red hair on the wig.",
        "That\u2019s the most important element.",
        "You could also add glittery aqua eye shadow or face shimmer for a great Ariel vibe.",
        "Add your finishing touches.",
        "There are so many things you can do for this \u2013 your imagination is the limit!",
        "Body glitter would be great for Ariel.",
        "Painting your fingernails a nice glittery shade of silver would be a great touch, as well!"
