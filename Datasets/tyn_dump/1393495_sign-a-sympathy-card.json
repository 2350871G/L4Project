                    "description": "The most common way to begin a sympathy card note is to start with the word \"Dear.\" You could also write \"Dearest,\" or simply start with the person's name. Avoid starting with \"Hi\" or another casual salutation - err on the side of being a little formal. Address the person to whom you're writing as you'd normally address that person. If you're writing to a teacher you normally call \"Ms. Frankel,\" address her that way in the card. If you're writing to someone you know well, using the person's first name is appropriate. If the card is meant to express sympathy to an entire family, and not just one person, write each person's name out. If you don't know the names of everyone in the family, you could write \"Sarah and family.\""
