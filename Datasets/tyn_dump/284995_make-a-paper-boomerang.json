    "text": " Getting Started Use scissors to cut a sheet of blank paper in half lengthwise. Start with a sheet of paper that's 8.5 inches (21.6 cm) by 11 inches (27.9 cm). Place one of the halves on a flat surface in front of you. Discard the other half or save it to make a second origami boomerang. Fold the piece of paper in half lengthwise. Use your finger to make a crease along the fold. Unfold the piece of paper. Fold the paper in half lengthwise on both sides of the crease. Bring the edges of the paper to the center crease when you fold the sides in half. Make a crease along both folds with your finger. Leave the sides folded in. Fold the paper in half crosswise. Bring the top edge of the paper down to the bottom edge. Make a crease along the fold with your finger. Leave the paper folded in half. Fold the top left and right corners to the center crease. Crease the folds with your fingers. Go over these creases several times so they're really defined. Unfold the corners. Unfold the crosswise fold you made and turn the paper so it's horizontal. When you're finished, you should have a thin horizontal rectangle with 2 triangles pointing at each other in the middle. Unfold the flap of paper on the bottom half. This is the flap of paper that's closest to you. After you unfold it you should see a diamond in the creases on the lower half of the paper. Making Valley and Mountain Folds Make a valley fold from the right tip of the diamond to the bottom edge of the paper. To make a valley fold, fold each side of the crease up and crease along the fold with your finger. Unfold the paper. Make a valley fold along all the creases in the diamond. Carefully make a fold along each crease by folding the two sides of the crease up. Crease along the fold with your finger. Make a valley fold along the 2 creases on the right side of the upside down triangle. Make the folds one at a time. Fold up the paper on each side of the crease and then crease along the fold. Make a mountain fold along the left crease in the upside down triangle. A mountain fold is the reverse of a valley fold. Instead of folding the paper up, you fold it down. Fold the paper down on each side of the crease and make a crease along the fold with your finger. Make a mountain fold along the crease running down the center of the diamond. Make the fold the same way you did with the other mountain folds. Fold the paper down on both sides of the crease. Crease along the fold with your finger. Fold up the top half of the paper so it's perpendicular to the table. The top half of the paper should have been lying flat on the table up until this point. Fold it up along the crease running lengthwise down the center of the paper. Folding Into a \"7\" Shape Bend the right side of the paper clockwise until it makes a \u201c7\u201d shape. The bottom half of the paper will start to lift up as you're moving the right side of the paper clockwise. The paper should bend in half along the mountain fold in the middle of the diamond. Fold the left edge on the stem of the \u201c7\u201d shape to the right along the crease. Use your finger to make a crease along the fold. Fold the top edge on the top of the \u201c7\u201d shape down along the crease. Make a crease along the fold with your finger. Fold up the bottom edge on the top of the \u201c7\u201d shape to make a valley fold. Tuck the right corner into the pocket located at the top right corner of the \u201c7\u201d shape. Crease along the fold with your finger. Finishing Your Boomerang Unfold the bottom of the stem on the \u201c7\u201d shape. Don't unfold the entire stem. Just slightly unfold the section at the bottom. Fold the bottom left and right corners into the center crease. Use your finger to crease along the folds. Slightly unfold the corners. Make an inside reverse fold using the left corner. Use your finger to push the tip of the left corner inside the corner itself. Once the corner is pushed in, crease the folds. You should now have a flat, diagonal edge along the bottom left side of the stem of the \u201c7\u201d shape. Tuck the right corner between the 2 layers of the left reverse fold. Pull the tip of the right corner to the left and curl it under so it reaches. Fold along the crease with your fingers. Unfold the left side of the top of the \u201c7\u201d shape. Don't unfold the whole top. You just want to slightly unfold the left side. Fold the top and bottom corners into the center crease. Use your finger to make a crease along the folds. Make an inside reverse fold using the top corner. Push the tip of the top corner inside of the corner until the corner is folded inside of itself. When you're finished, you'll have a diagonal edge along the top of the top of the \u201c7\u201d shape. Tuck the the bottom corner between the 2 layers of the top reverse fold. Do this just like you did on the stem of the \u201c7\u201d shape. Pull the bottom corner up and curve it down so it tucks into the inside reverse fold at the top. Crease along the fold with your finger. Your origami boomerang is complete! Try out your origami boomerang. Hold the middle of the boomerang between your thumb and index finger. Throw the boomerang horizontally like you're throwing a frisbee. Flick your wrist out as you throw the boomerang so it spins in the air.",
