Thrift stores often have sets of old ornaments, or you can find inexpensive packs at the dollar store. For the bows, use gift wrap stick-on ones, fabric bows, or use wire-edged ribbon to make bows yourself. Anywhere from 15-30 ornaments should be good for your sweater. Keep in mind that they definitely don\u2019t need to match, and they don\u2019t need to be super attractive, either. For a flashier sweater, opt for glitter-covered ornaments. They\u2019ll add sparkle to your outfit, and they\u2019ll catch lots of light, making you the star of the party."
