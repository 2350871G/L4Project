    "text": " Making the Tunic Buy a half a yard (0.5m) of orange fabric and half a yard (0.5m) of brown fabric. Felt from a bolt at the craft store works great for this project because it doesn\u2019t fray. You can also dig in your closet for an old orange or brown t-shirt or sweatshirt. Measure the circumference of the costume wearer\u2019s waist. Buy a half-inch width of elastic that will cover this width. Measure the length of their body from waist to just below the knees. Add two inches (5cm) to the measurement for the waistband. Use a cloth measuring tape to cut a width of orange felt that is one to two inches longer than the wearer\u2019s waist. Then, measure the length and cut it to the knee measurement you just took. You should have an orange rectangle that will serve as a skirt. Lay the rectangle right side down. Place the elastic across the top and fold the top edge down over the elastic. Pin it in place, leaving about a quarter of an inch (0.6cm) below the pin for the seam. Thread your sewing machine and sew the top band of the skirt down over the elastic. You can also sew by hand if you don\u2019t have a sewing machine. Pin the back edge of the skirt together, where the two ends meet. Turn it inside out. Sew through both layers for an easy hem. Cut a saw tooth pattern into the bottom of the skirt with fabric scissors. Cut up about three inches to make triangles. The bottom hem of the skirt should be zigzagged all the way around, to follow the Flintstones famous fashions. Take your brown fabric. Cut a long four-inch (10cm) section with your fabric scissors. Attach it with pins to the front right-hand side of the skirt and the back left-hand side. Have your costume-wearer try it on. Adjust and pin accordingly. Sew the strap inside the waistband of the skirt. Cut small triangles out of the remaining brown fabric. You will need about 30 2-inch (5cm) triangles for the skirt and 10 for the cap. Glue the triangles onto the skirt at random, but even, intervals.  Accessorizing the Costume Find a dog bone. A stuffed, white dog toy is ideal, but you can also use a lightweight dog bone. Glue it onto the front of the strap on the skirt. Buy a short white wig. A white mop head can also work for this purpose. Set the new mop head on the wearer\u2019s head and then trim around the ears. Find an orange ball cap. A hunter\u2019s cap works well, or you can look for a small beanie. Glue the remaining triangles onto the cap with fabric glue. Find a plastic child\u2019s bat, such as a whiffle ball bat. Spray paint it brown. Have your child hold it. You can create a plush version out of extra fabric and stuffing if you are afraid of damage.",
