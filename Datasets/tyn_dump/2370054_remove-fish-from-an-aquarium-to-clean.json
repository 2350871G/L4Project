        "Doug has worked in the aquarium and fish-care industry for over 20 years, including having worked as a professional aquarist for the Minnesota Zoo and Shedd Aquarium in Chicago.",
        "He received his Bachelor of Science in Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior from the University of Minnesota.",
        "Doug Ludemann\t\t\tProfessional Aquarist\t\t\t\tThe key to removing algae is exporting the nutrients that cause algae to grow.",
        "The cheapest way to do this is through water changes.",
        "You can also try protein skimming, which eliminates compounds from the water instead of only trapping them in a filter where they can break down and cause algae.",
        "Change 20% to 25% of the water if the tank is excessively dirty.",
        "Normal tank maintenance has you replace 10% to 15% of the water on a weekly basis, but sometimes you might need to do a little more.",
        "For example, if your tank hasn\u2019t been cleaned in several weeks, or if your fish have started to get sick or die, you might need to do a larger change than you normally would.",
        "Keep in mind:\nIf you have a saltwater aquarium, you will need to check the saline, pH, and ammonia levels and get them back to a normal range before replacing your fish.",
        "If you have a freshwater aquarium, you will need to pay attention to the water temperature and dechlorinate the water before you add it to the tank.",
        "Transfer the fish back to the aquarium once you\u2019re done cleaning.",
        "Once the tank is clean, gently net the fish and put them back into the aquarium.",
        "Remember to move 1 fish at a time and to lower the net into the aquarium to safely release them.",
        "Don\u2019t forget to feed your fish once they\u2019re back home.",
        "Maintaining Your Tank Change 10% to 15% of the tank\u2019s water every week.",
        "Fill up a bucket (always use a clean bucket that has never been washed with chemicals or detergents) with tap water for a freshwater tank or reverse-osmosis water or distilled water for a saltwater tank.",
        "Check that the water temperature is the same as the water currently in the aquarium.",
        "For a freshwater tank, add in a de-chlorinator to treat the water.",
        "For a saltwater tank, treat the water with an aquarium-specific saline solution.",
        "Then use an automatic water changer to siphon off old water and replace it with the new water.",
        "If you don\u2019t have an automatic water changer, you\u2019ll need to haul off several buckets-full of water manually and replace them with the fresh water.",
        "Don\u2019t just \u201ctop off\u201d the tank to replace water that has evaporated.",
        "The water still has some built-up impurities that need to be replaced, and that\u2019s only done by removing and replacing water.",
        "Clean out the filters on a bi-weekly or monthly basis.",
        "Fill a small, clean bowl with water from the aquarium.",
        "Remove the filters and rinse them out in the bowl.",
        "Never use tap water, because that can remove the good bacteria that you need to keep your tank healthy.",
        "Replace the filters right away.",
        "If the tubing for the filters looks dirty, use a pipe cleaner or filter brush to scrub them clean, too.",
        "Scrub away algae from the walls of the aquarium bi-weekly.",
        "Use an algae scrubber to scrape down the sides of the tank, working from the top of the tank down to the bottom.",
        "Make sure your hands are clean before you put them into the tank, or wear clean rubber gloves to do this work.",
        "Never use a dish sponge or rag to clean the tank.",
        "These could introduce harmful bacteria to your aquarium.",
        "If you don\u2019t already, think about getting some algae-eating creatures to help keep your tank clean.",
        "Siphon the gravel every 2 weeks to clean away waste.",
        "Use your aquarium vacuum by sticking one end into the gravel and following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.",
        "Vacuum the bottom of the tank back and forth until the water coming out the other end starts to run clear.",
        "You usually don\u2019t need to clean all of the gravel.",
        "Rather, try cleaning just 1/4 to 1/2 of it.",
        "This will leave some of the healthy bacteria in place that helps keep your aquarium\u2019s habitat running.",
        "Remove and clean the tank decorations when they get visibly dirty.",
        "When you notice that the decorations in the tank are starting to get covered in algae, take a few minutes to remove the item and clean it off.",
        "Just clean 1 item at a time to keep from disrupting your fish.",
        "Never use chemical cleaners or soap to clean aquarium decorations."
