If you cannot turn your back to a wall, stand up as straight as possible and avoid hunching your shoulders. Stretch your arms out as far as they will go. Avoid bending your arms or your fingers. Try to keep your arms level and even, as raising or lowering your arms can also decrease your full arm span. Measure between both of your middle fingers.
