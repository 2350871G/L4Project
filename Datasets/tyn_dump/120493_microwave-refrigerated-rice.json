    "text": " Using a Paper Towel Put the rice on a plate. Unless you have a specific need to use a bowl, a plate allows the rice more surface area on which to be heated. It will allow the moisture added to reach more of the rice. Use a fork to break up any clumps of rice. If you must use a bowl, try and have it be as shallow as possible. Dampen a paper towel. Take a paper towel and soak it in lukewarm water. Make sure to use a large enough paper towel to cover the area of the plate you're using. Once damp, carefully ring out the towel (avoid tearing) enough so that it's still damp, but not dripping water. Place the towel over the rice. Lay the damp paper towel flat over the top of the rice.

This both helps to cool down the rice and allow more time for the moisture to reach the rice. Once done, remove the paper towel and enjoy your rice. Using a Cup of Water Fill a microwave-safe cup. Using any micro-wave safe cup, fill about 2/3 of it with warm water. If you have no paper towels on hand, including a cup of water in the microwave along with the rice is an alternative way of adding moisture into the microwaving process. As the water heats, it releases steam at least some of which will return to your rice as added moisture (much how rice is cooked in the first place). Microwave the cup for one minute. Before adding the rice, heat the water in the microwave for a minute (or until you see it boil) to prime it for use with the rice.
