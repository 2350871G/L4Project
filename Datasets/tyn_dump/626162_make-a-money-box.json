Take the lid off the shoebox, and, using your largest piece of currency (eg, quarter, half-dollar, etc.) as a guide, draw a rectangular coin slot wide enough for it to fit. You can draw the coin slot on either the lid or one of the long sides of the box, depending on your preference. Cut out the coin slot. Using a craft knife (scissors will leave a ragged edge), cut out the rectangle to make the coin slot. If a child will be doing this project, have an adult do this part. Measure the dimensions of the box. You\u2019ll use these measurements to cut out pieces of paper or fabric to fit the box. Use a ruler to measure the height, width, and length of the shoebox on its four sides and its lid. Write these measurements down. Use a ruler to measure the length and width of the top of the lid. Measure the height of the lip of the top and add that onto both the length and width measurements. Write the measurements down. Cut out the paper or fabric.

You\u2019ll want a container large and sturdy enough for your particular purpose that includes a plastic lid, like a can of nuts. Empty the container of its contents. Wash and dry the inside. Remove the lid and set it flat and upside-down on a cutting surface. Make sure the lid is sitting so that it\u2019s resting flat against the cutting surface for stability. Find the largest coin you have (like a quarter or half-dollar). Using the coin as a guide, trace the outline for the slot opening with a permanent marker or felt-tip pen. Cut out a hole in the lid. Using the outline you traced, cut a hole for the coin slot with a craft knife or pocket knife (which ever is best). Be extremely careful when using the craft knife, as it\u2019s quite sharp.

Use the circumference (including the additional centimeter or two) for the width of the rectangle. Cut out the rectangle. After tracing out the rectangle, cut it from the paper or fabric using the outline as a guide. Once the rectangle is cut, wrap it around the container to make sure it fits properly. If it\u2019s too large, trim it down to size. If it\u2019s too small, begin again with a new piece of paper or fabric. Add any decorative writing or drawings you want to include.

        "If a child is doing the project, perform this step for them.",
        "Test the coin slot.",
        "Using the same coin, test the slot you\u2019ve cut in the lid to be sure it\u2019s big enough.",
        "If the slot is too small, carefully use the craft knife to trim the edges until it\u2019s the right size.",
        "Measure the container.",
        "Using a flexible measuring tape or ribbon, measure the container so you can wrap it with the right amount of paper or fabric.",
        "Measure the circumference of the container; write down the measurement, adding one or two centimeters for overlap allowance.",
        "Measure the height of the container and write it down.",
        "Choose the paper or fabric with which to wrap the container.",
        "This is what will turn your can from a boring food container to an attractive, personalized money box.",

        "Lay the paper or fabric face-down on your cutting surface.",
        "Outline the dimensions of the container.",
        "Using the height and circumference measurements you wrote down, use a ruler to draw a rectangle of the same height.",
        "Use the circumference (including the additional centimeter or two) for the width of the rectangle.",
        "Cut out the rectangle.",
        "After tracing out the rectangle, cut it from the paper or fabric using the outline as a guide.",
        "Once the rectangle is cut, wrap it around the container to make sure it fits properly.",
        "If it\u2019s too large, trim it down to size.",
        "If it\u2019s too small, begin again with a new piece of paper or fabric.",
        "Add any decorative writing or drawings you want to include.",
        "Before securing the paper or fabric to the container, lay it down right side up and write or draw any of the decorations you plan to use.",

        "Wrap the paper or fabric around the container and secure it.",
        "When you\u2019ve finished adding any desired writing or drawings, flip the fabric or paper upside down.",

        "Slowly and carefully wrap the paper or fabric around the container, smoothing it with your hand as you go.",
        "The paper or fabric should ideally overlap, but if it doesn\u2019t and a small strip of the container is visible, cover it with a ribbon, a strip of colored paper, or another decoration.",
        "Add any additional desired decorations.",
        "After the paper or fabric is secure, add any additional decorations you may want.",
        "At this stage, you can add decorations like buttons, ribbons, jewels, etc.",
        "Use hot glue if the decoration is heavy or won\u2019t stay in place with regular glue.",
        "Place the lid on the container.",
        "Finally, place the lid with the coin slot on the container.",
        "When the glue is dry, your money box will be ready for use.",
        "Using Gift Boxes To Make a Wedding Box Choose the gift boxes you\u2019ll use.",
        "Gift boxes are a slightly nicer option for money box material and so can be ideal for making a wedding box--the box into which guests can put checks, money, cards, etc.",
        "at a wedding reception.",
        "This particular design mimics the look of a tiered wedding cake or a stack of gifts.",
        "Choose three gift boxes (or whatever number you prefer).",
        "The boxes you choose can be square or round, depending on your own preference or the wedding theme.",
        "The boxes should be in descending size, in order to create what will appear to be a stack.",
        "Cut a slot in either the side or lid of the top box or in the side of the middle box.",
        "The box you choose is up to you; the top box will be easier for people to see, while the middle box will be larger.",
        "The placement of the slot depends on how you're decorating the box and what you think will be more visually pleasing.",
        "Use a ruler and marker to trace out a rectangular shape either on the lid or side of the top box or on the side of the middle box.",
        "The rectangle should be slim but both long and wide enough to accommodate long envelopes.",
        "Cut out a neat rectangle shape.",
        "Use a craft knife to cut out the rectangle shape to form an envelope slot.",
        "A craft knife is preferable over scissors, which will leave ragged edges.",
        "Measure the dimensions of the boxes.",
        "Use a ruler to measure length and width or each side of each gift box.",
        "Write down the dimensions of each.",
        "Cut decorative paper or fabric to fit over the sides of the boxes.",
        "Using the measurements for reference, lay the paper or fabric upside down on a flat surface.",
        "Trace the dimensions of each side of each box onto the paper or fabric.",
        "If necessary, label the outlines so you\u2019ll know which box they belong to.",
        "Adhere the fabric or paper to the boxes.",
        "Spread a thin layer of glue on the back of each cutout and attach it to the corresponding part of each box.",

        "Add a message underneath the money slot, saying something simple, such as \"Thank You\" or \"Kaitlin and Rob, 2015.\"",
        "Assemble the money box stack.",
        "Place the largest box at the base, place the next largest on top, then place the smallest on top.",
        "Secure them in place with glue.",
        "You can optionally also tie a wide, quality ribbon around the entire stack, finishing it with a large bow on the top box to make it resemble a stack of gifts.",
