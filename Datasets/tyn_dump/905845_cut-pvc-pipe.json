You could also use another type of work clamp to just secure the pipe into place on your workbench, rather than using a vise. Use what's available. Clamp it a few inches away from the cut to give yourself ample clearance. If possible, you can clamp on both sides of your cut, but having one clamp a few inches from intended cut line will make it plenty secure."
