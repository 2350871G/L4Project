Get the \"old country\" look by making bright squares but putting them together with a black border. Get a classic American look by combining, white, red, blue, and pale yellow.

After the yarn you pulled is wrapped around the hook, pull another loop through that, making a second chain stitch. Be sure to leave at least 4 inches (10.2 cm) of yarn at the beginning in case you need it later. Slip stitch into the first chain. This forms a ring. Pull a new loop through the loop already on the hook, as well as through the chain stitch. Chain three. This is the same as if you were doing rows of double crochet stitch. Double crochet. Make two double crochet into the center of the ring. Chain and double again. Chain two then make three double crochet into the center of the ring. Do this 3 times, for a total of 4 groups of 3 dc (double crochet). Slip stitch to finish. Slip stitch into the top of the three chain to finish the round. Making the Middle Row Start with a new color. Add a new color for the next row if you like. Simply start crocheting with the new color from any ch-sp (chain space, the gaps left by the chain stitches between the bunches of double crochet). Chain three again. Again, this is the same as if you were doing rows of double crochet stitch. Double crochet in the corners. In the chain space described above, do 3 double crochet stitches (but don't forget that in your first set, the first dc is really the chain three that you did already). Move to the next chain space. Chain two over the double crochet bunch and then make three more double crochet stitches into the next chain space. This begins to create the square. Form the corner. Make 3 chain stitches to form the corner of the square and then double crochet 3 more into the same chain space. Change to 1 chain stitch between if you want a rounder, tighter square as shown in the pictures. Continue until the row is complete. Do all 4 corners, and then slip stitch to the top of the ch-3 in the first corner to finish the round. Each corner should have two sets of three dc, each separated by three chain stitches. Completing the Square Start the next row. Change colors again if you like. Continue similarly to the previous row. Double crochet 2 bunches of three stitches (separated by three chain stitches) into each corner.
