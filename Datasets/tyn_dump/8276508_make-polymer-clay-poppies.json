        "Set the peduncle in place.",
        "Apply just the slightest pressure to help it set into the liquid.",
        "Once it\u2019s in place, use the same stylus as before to reshape any lines that might have smoothed out while being handled.",
        "If necessary, go over it again with your toothbrush as well.",
        "Add more liquid clay.",
        "First, trace a thin line around the edges of the peduncle.",
        "Secure it that much more to your flower.",
        "Then add lines of liquid clay from the peduncles\u2019 edges straight up along the petals.",
        "Remember: you\u2019re trying to replicate nature, so try not to be too orderly about drawing lines.",
        "Avoid patterns (like one short, one long, one short, one long, etc.)",
        "or drawing two side-by-side lines that look exactly the same.",
        "When it\u2019s finished, there shouldn\u2019t be any open space between the lines radiating out from the peduncle.",
        "Adding Finishing Touches Bake your clay.",
        "Harden what you have so you can move on to the flower\u2019s back without wrecking its front.",
        "Heat your oven to 130 degrees Celsius (266 Fahrenheit).",
        "Once it\u2019s ready, set your flower on a baking sheet and bake for ten minutes.",
        "However, always check the directions of your particular brand of clay first.",
        "If the manufacturer advises a lower temperature, follow their instructions.",
        "Polymer clay is safe to bake in a home oven, as long as you don\u2019t burn it.",
        "If it burns, it may start to release toxic fumes.",
        "To be extra safe, use an oven thermometer to confirm that your oven doesn\u2019t heat higher than the temperature you set it to.",
        "A baking sheet is probably very easy to clean, but to be extra safe, devote one exclusively for clay.",
        "Don\u2019t reuse it for cooking.",
        "Add petals to the back.",
        "After your clay is done baking, let your flower cool off before handling it again.",
        "Once it\u2019s cool enough to touch, brush liquid clay along the back of the base.",
        "Use fresh red clay to form a thin disk that\u2019s a little smaller than the flower\u2019s base.",
        "Press this into the liquid clay.",
        "Once your disk is attached to the back of the base, add your remaining five petals to the fresh clay.",
        "Use the same technique as before.",
        "Smooth the bottom of each petal into the clay.",
        "Use each petal to cover half of the previous one.",
        "Then use your styluses to twist your petals\u2019 edges for a more natural, random effect.",
        "Top the back with a sepal.",
        "A flower's sepal is a leaf-like growth that cups the back of the flower.",
        "Roll out a thin sheet of green clay.",
        "Use your stylus to trace outline for a sepal to add to the back of your flower (these resemble a bikini shape), and then cut it out with a sculpting knife.",
        "Run your stylus down the center of each one of its three offshoots.",
        "Then use your thinnest stylus to draw veins from the center line out to the edges of each side.",
        "Once you\u2019re done, place one sepal over the back\u2019s center, using your fingers or stylus to gently press it into the new petals so their clays join.",
        "Go over your sepal\u2019s lines with your thin stylus again to sharpen them if they smoothed out while you pressed.",
        "Bake, paint, and glaze, if desired.",
        "Return the clay to the oven to bake for another 15 to 20 minutes.",
        "Remove it and let it cool off again.",
        "To add even more detail in and around the peduncle, apply brown or black acrylic paint with a fine brush along its lines, as well as the surrounding lines of dried liquid clay.",
        "Once the paint dries, brush the whole thing with sculptor\u2019s glaze for a shiny finish, if you like."
