Semi-permanent dyes last through 6-12 shampoos and demi-permanent dyes last for 12-24 shampoos. Semi- and demi-permanent dyes provide limited coverage, so they work best if you have minimal gray or need to touch up gray roots on dyed blonde hair. These dyes are great options if want to experiment with color without commitment. They can be invaluable tools as you begin your gray-to-blonde journey!"

                    "description": "For the longest lasting and best coverage with the least amount of damage, permanent hair dye is the way to go. It\u2019s the best choice if you need to dye your full head rather than touch up your roots. You can also go with high-lift dye, which is a type of permanent dye that includes additional boosters and ammonia to strip out stubborn or dark gray. High-lift dyes lighten and deposit new color simultaneously so that you don't have to bleach your hair. Gray hair is fragile so it's best to avoid bleach if you can. High-lift dyes are more damaging than the other options, but they're still a lot less damaging than bleach. Once your gray roots start growing in after using permanent or high-lift dye, you can use a gentler demi- or semi-permanent dye to cover them with minimal damage to your hair.Tip: If your hair is naturally medium to dark brown, auburn, or black and you haven't gone completely gray, you'll need to strip the natural color out of your hair with bleach first. Buy a bleaching kit at a beauty supply store and apply the product to your hair following the package instructions. After rinsing out the bleach mixture, apply a permanent blonde dye or use a purple toning shampoo to achieve the blonde shade that you want."

If you\u2019re mostly gray, a cool or ashy blonde shade works great because it blends well for all-over coverage and flatters most skin tones. If you aren\u2019t sure what to choose, consider a neutral blonde shade, which includes a mix of warm and cool tones and tends to flatter everyone's skin tone. Neutral blonde shades might have names like \"iced latte\" or \"pearl copper.\" Most dyes state warm, cool, or neutral on the box, though. If you\u2019re dyeing your roots, choose a blonde shade that matches your lengths or go 1 shade lighter to create a natural-looking blend with your lengths. If you aren\u2019t using a box kit, you\u2019ll need to buy dye and developer separately at a beauty supply store."

If your hair is dirtier than that, the oils and product buildup may prevent the dye from adhering to the hair shaft and you could end up with patchy results.

        "These dyes are great options if want to experiment with color without commitment.",
        "They can be invaluable tools as you begin your gray-to-blonde journey!",
        "Select permanent or high-lift dye if you need more than 25% gray coverage.",
        "For the longest lasting and best coverage with the least amount of damage, permanent hair dye is the way to go.",
        "It\u2019s the best choice if you need to dye your full head rather than touch up your roots.",
        "You can also go with high-lift dye, which is a type of permanent dye that includes additional boosters and ammonia to strip out stubborn or dark gray.",
        "High-lift dyes lighten and deposit new color simultaneously so that you don't have to bleach your hair.",
        "Gray hair is fragile so it's best to avoid bleach if you can.",
        "High-lift dyes are more damaging than the other options, but they're still a lot less damaging than bleach.",
        "Once your gray roots start growing in after using permanent or high-lift dye, you can use a gentler demi- or semi-permanent dye to cover them with minimal damage to your hair.Tip: If your hair is naturally medium to dark brown, auburn, or black and you haven't gone completely gray, you'll need to strip the natural color out of your hair with bleach first.",
        "Buy a bleaching kit at a beauty supply store and apply the product to your hair following the package instructions.",
        "After rinsing out the bleach mixture, apply a permanent blonde dye or use a purple toning shampoo to achieve the blonde shade that you want.",
        "Choose a blonde shade of dye that flatters your skin's undertones.",
        "If your skin has warm undertones, a golden blonde shade will flatter your skin and blend well with the gray.",
        "If you\u2019re mostly gray, a cool or ashy blonde shade works great because it blends well for all-over coverage and flatters most skin tones.",
        "If you aren\u2019t sure what to choose, consider a neutral blonde shade, which includes a mix of warm and cool tones and tends to flatter everyone's skin tone.",
        "Neutral blonde shades might have names like \"iced latte\" or \"pearl copper.\"",
        "Most dyes state warm, cool, or neutral on the box, though.",
        "If you\u2019re dyeing your roots, choose a blonde shade that matches your lengths or go 1 shade lighter to create a natural-looking blend with your lengths.",
        "If you aren\u2019t using a box kit, you\u2019ll need to buy dye and developer separately at a beauty supply store.",
        "Brush out your dry, unwashed hair to remove any tangles.",
        "Gently run a paddle brush through your lengths to get rid of any knots.",
        "Keep in mind that freshly washed hair doesn\u2019t absorb the dye well because it makes the hair slippery.",
        "Hair that hasn\u2019t been washed in 24-48 hours is ideal for applying hair dye.",
        "If your hair is dirtier than that, the oils and product buildup may prevent the dye from adhering to the hair shaft and you could end up with patchy results.",
        "If you have thick, curly hair, use a wide-tooth comb instead of a paddle brush to work through any tangles.",
        "Put on an old T-shirt and plastic gloves to protect your skin and hands.",
        "Dyeing your hair can be a messy job, so be sure to wear clothing that you don\u2019t mind staining and pull on a pair of plastic gloves before you start working with the dye so you don\u2019t stain your skin.",
        "You may also want to cover your work surface with plastic garbage bags or newspaper.",
        "Mix the dye and developer according to the package instructions.",
        "If you\u2019re using a kit, follow the provided instructions to mix the developer and dye in a plastic applicator bottle.",
        "You don\u2019t need to do any measuring.",
        "If you bought your items separately, mix the developer and dye in a medium-sized plastic bowl.",
        "Stir the ingredients together until they\u2019re fully combined.",
        "Measurements for separate products will vary, but the ratio is typically 1:1.",
        "Your dye kit will include the plastic applicator bottle.",
        "Separate your hair into 4 quadrants and clip up 3 of them.",
        "Run the pointed end of a rat tooth comb across your hair from ear to ear to create 2 sections of hair.",
        "Then, run the end of the comb from the center of your forehead back to the crown of your head to create 4 sections.",
        "Twist and clip up 3 of the sections with plastic hair clips.",
        "If you\u2019re touching up regrowth, use a hair clip to secure the lengths of your hair away from your face.",
        "You only need to apply dye mixture to your hairline and visible roots.",
        "Be gentle with your hair as you section and clip it up!",
        "Gray hair tends to be on the dry side and manipulating it roughly can cause breakage.",
        "Use the applicator to apply the dye mixture from root to tip.",
        "If you\u2019re dyeing your whole head of hair, brush the dye mixture on your hair with the applicator, starting at the roots.",
        "If you\u2019re using an applicator bottle, apply at the roots and spread the mixture over your roots with your fingers.",
        "Once the roots are saturated, work your way down to the ends until all of the hair in the first section is fully saturated.",
        "To refresh roots, brush the dye mixture at the hairline first.",
        "Stay close to the roots and only cover the amount of dark hair showing.",
        "Clip the saturated hair back and repeat the process for the remaining 3 sections of hair.",
        "Clip each section back up after you saturate the hair with dye mixture to keep it out of your face.",
        "Let the dye sit on your hair for the recommended time on the package.",
        "Check the instructions for the processing time.",
        "This varies by brand, but it\u2019s typically 15-20 minutes for a root touch up and 20-35 minutes for a full head application.",
        "Don't be concerned if the dye mixture looks darker on your head than it did when you first mixed it.",
        "This is totally normal and the color of the dye mixture at this point doesn't accurately represent the color of your actual results.",
        "For safety reasons, never let hair dye sit on your hair for longer than the recommended time on the packaging.",
        "Rinse out the dye thoroughly with cool water.",
        "Remove the clips and carefully rinse each quadrant of hair with cool water until the water runs clear.",
        "Be sure to rinse your scalp along with your lengths so that all traces of dye are removed.",
        "Retouch roots with demi-permanent dye every few weeks, as needed.",
        "As your hair grows, those stubborn grays will start showing at the roots once again.",
        "How long this takes depends on how quickly your hair grows and how much gray hair you have.",
        "If you are mostly gray, you may need to touch up your roots after about 3-4 weeks.",
        "Ask your stylist about adding dimension with highlights or lowlights.",
        "Highlights and lowlights incorporate subtly different shades of blonde throughout your hair to create a natural look with lots of dimension.",
        "They can be a great tool for blending gray hair into an all-over blonde look.",
        "Talk to your stylist about getting semi permanent highlights and/or lowlights to achieve this look.",
        "It\u2019s best to have highlights and lowlights done in a salon by a professional.",
        "As your hair grows, those pesky gray roots will usually be most visible around your hair's part.",
        "Try asking for highlights along your part to break up the gray!",
        "Applying Blonde Henna Recipe with Cassia Obovata Select a henna powder product that is labeled blonde or cassia obovata.",

        "The only blonde shade available is cassia obovata.",
        "Some products may simply be labeled as blonde so customers can find the right shade more easily, but the powder\u2019s true name is cassia obovata.",

        "Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit for 12 hours.",
