Use a sharp chef\u2019s knife to slice the carrot in half horizontally. If a carrot is particularly long, you may want to cut it into three or four pieces. You\u2019ll have the easiest time julienning pieces that are approximately 3- to 4-inches (8 to 10 cm) long or smaller. It\u2019s important to work on a cutting board so you don\u2019t damage your countertop or other surface while you\u2019re julienning the carrots."

Be careful to curl your fingertips out of the way because the round shape of the carrot means it may move as you\u2019re cutting. If your carrot keeps moving as you're trying to cut, you may want to slice a small piece off on one side to create a flat surface to steady it. The safest positioning when holding a carrot for cutting consists of your fingertips bent at the top knuckle, so that your fingernails are vertical to the carrot. You can also apply slight pressure with your fingernails as a means of holding the carrot steady from this position"

Julienning Carrots with a Mandoline Set the mandoline on a flat surface.
