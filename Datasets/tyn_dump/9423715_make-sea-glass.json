After a few hours or days, it\u2019s possible for these gases to build up inside the barrel, which could create pressure leaks or send glass particles spraying out when you remove the lid later. The baking soda will absorb the gases, limiting the pressure inside the tumbler. Keep an eye on your rock tumbler as it turns. If the barrel looks like it\u2019s bulging, remove the lid momentarily to let the excess gas escape. Baking soda isn\u2019t an essential component for making sea glass, so there\u2019s no need to go out and buy it if you don\u2019t already have some.
