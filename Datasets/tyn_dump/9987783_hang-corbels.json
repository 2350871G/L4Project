Slide the stud finder across the wall where you want to hang the corbels. Listen for a beep, or look for the light to flash, depending on your model. When the finder locates your stud, make a mark with a pencil so you can position your corbels. If you don\u2019t have a stud finder, that\u2019s okay. Use heavy-duty wall anchors and screws instead.

Oftentimes, corbels have keyhole slots on the back so you can easily hang them on the wall.

Ensure your holes are parallel, so you don't hang your corbels unevenly. Ensure your nail is the appropriate size for your keyhole or drilled hole. Place the nail inside the slot or hole before you hang up the corbel. If the nail fits securely, it is an adequate size. Most keyhole slots are \u204416 in (0.48 cm), so you want to use a nail with a \u204416 in (0.48 cm) head. If you use the wrong size nail, your corbel may fall off the wall. Use a pencil to mark the placement of each hole. Line your corbels up with your guidelines, and make a mark on either side approximately where the hole or slot is located. Do this for both corbels so you can easily hammer in your nails. Hammer 4 nails into the wall at a 45-degree angle. Hold 1 nail up to 1 of the markings you made, and tilt the top slightly upwards so it is at an angle. Then, use a hammer to attach it to the wall. Continue hammering until about \u20444 in (0.64 cm) of your nail sticks out of the wall. Hammer in a nail for each of your markings. You should have 2 nails installed for each corbel.
