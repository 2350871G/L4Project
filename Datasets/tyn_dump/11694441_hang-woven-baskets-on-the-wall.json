To create an engaging design, try placing your larger baskets on 1 side of the wall, then hang up baskets that gradually decrease in size. As a simple design idea, place your woven baskets in a straight line on your wall, arranging them in descending order by size. Alternatively, arrange the baskets in a circle. Put the largest basket in the middle and group the others around it so they get smaller toward the edges."

If your baskets aren\u2019t painted or dyed, sort them by the color of the material. As you prepare to hang up your baskets, consider displaying baskets with multiple colors and shades. For instance, you could hang up 3 cream-colored baskets along with 3 light brown baskets. As a potential design plan, try alternating light and dark baskets to create an ovular or rectangular shape on your wall!"
