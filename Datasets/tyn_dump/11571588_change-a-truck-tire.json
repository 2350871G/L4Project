Also, pick a secluded spot where you won\u2019t be disturbed by other vehicles. Hard surfaces are always better than soft ones. Soft soil, for example, may not be able to support the truck\u2019s weight, causing it to fall off a jack. The spot you choose is an important part of changing a tire safely. If you don\u2019t feel safe where you are, you are better off calling for a tow truck."

                    "description": "Chocks are small rubber blocks you can wedge underneath each wheel. Place a chock in front of and behind each tire other than the one you want to change. If you don\u2019t have chocks, use bricks or wooden boards instead. Make sure they are firmly wedged underneath each wheel so it can\u2019t rotate at all. Auto part stores sell chocks, but you can also get them online. They are inexpensive but very effective at keeping you safe while working on a truck.

Slip the tip of a flathead screwdriver between the metal cover and the rubber tire. Then, pry the cover toward you in a few different spots to pop it off of the wheel. Some hubcaps are held in place by lug nuts. Using a lug wrench, loosen all of the nuts gradually and evenly until you are able to remove them. Most pickup trucks and flatbeds have hubcaps. Bigger vehicles, including semi trucks, often have a mix of covered and uncovered wheels."

They can be difficult to move at first, but keep trying until you no longer feel any resistance. You may need to step on the wrench or throw your body weight into it to break the lug nut free. Once you feel it come loose, stop turning it and leave it on the wheel. If you\u2019re having a hard time getting stubborn lug nuts to turn, spray a rust-busting lubricant like WD-40 on them. Lug wrenches are fine for pickups and flatbeds, but you will most likely need something stronger for bigger vehicles. Try using a breaker bar if you\u2019re doing it manually. For an easier way to detach the nuts, get a 1 in (2.5 cm) cordless impact wrench. It\u2019s a handheld tool similar to drill, but it has an open end meant to fit over lug nuts."

Many vehicles have notches near the wheel wells indicating a safe spot to place the jack. When using a bottle jack, pump the handle up and down to raise the truck. Lift it so the wheel is about 6 in (15 cm) off the ground. For safety, position the jack along a metal part of the frame rather than the plastic exterior. Check the owner\u2019s manual if you are unable to locate the jack point just by looking at the truck. To lift heavier trucks, including dump trucks and similar haulers, use a hydraulic lift instead. Park the truck on the lift, then pump the handle to raise it. The biggest lifts are capable of supporting the additional weight. Really big trucks like semis often don\u2019t need to be lifted. The other wheels are capable of supporting the truck\u2019s weight."

        "Lowering and Securing the Tire Pull the jack stands out from under the truck.",
        "Use the jack to raise the truck by 1 in (2.5 cm).",
        "This will give you some room to reach underneath the truck and slide the jack stands toward you.",
        "Collapse the jack stands so they are easier to store.",
        "Make sure the truck is stable on the jack before attempting to reach underneath it.",
        "Lower the truck by operating the jack.",
        "If you\u2019re using a bottle jack, remove the handle and attach it to the metal valve near the jack\u2019s base.",
        "Pump the handle to gradually bring the jack down until the truck\u2019s tires touch the ground.",
        "For a hydraulic lift, lower it until the truck is back on the ground.",
        "Don\u2019t remove the jack yet.",
        "Wait until you have finished tightening the lug nuts with a lug wrench or breaker bar to ensure the new tire is secure.",
        "Tighten the lug nuts by turning them clockwise with a lug wrench.",
        "Once the new tire is on solid ground, finish securing all the lug nuts.",
        "Tighten them until they can no longer be moved.",
        "Test the nuts by attempting to remove them by hand.",
        "If you are able to turn them, then you haven\u2019t tightened them enough.",
        "Use your foot or body weight as needed to help turn difficult nuts.",
        "Switch to a breaker bar or impact wrench if you aren\u2019t working on a pickup truck.",
        "Remember that bigger trucks can have as many as 10 lug nuts.",
        "Make sure you get them all!",
        "Replace the hubcap if the wheel had one.",
        "Many hubcap wheels fit directly over the side of the wheel and don\u2019t require any special tools to replace.",
        "Line up the notch on the hubcap with the valve stem, then push the hubcap onto the wheel.",
        "Start with the bottom edge, fitting it against the bottom rim of the tire.",
        "Then, fit the upper part against the tire, tapping it into place with a rubber mallet or the soft part of a hubcap removal tool.",
        "Some hubcaps screw into place.",
        "If you have this kind, fit it over the lug bolts before putting the nuts back into place.",
        "Keep the jack underneath the car until you\u2019re done with the installation."
