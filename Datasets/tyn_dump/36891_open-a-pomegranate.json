With a flat palm, apply gentle pressure along the side of the pomegranate. Continue to press firmly against it as you roll the pomegranate over your clean cutting board. This will make it much easier to remove the seeds. Put your pomegranate on its side on a cutting board. Place the pomegranate so that the fleshy side is facing the cutting board.

Submerging in Water to Remove Seeds Fill a large bowl with fresh, cool water. Use clean water, as you'll be consuming the pomegranate seeds.

There's no need to cut off the top or bottom if you're just removing the seeds. Just make a thin cut through the skin of the pomegranate. Don't cut deeply, as you don't want to cut the seeds.
