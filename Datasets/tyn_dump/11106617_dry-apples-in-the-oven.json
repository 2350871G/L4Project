Once the oven reaches the desired temperature, all you\u2019ll have to do is pop in the apples and set a timer. Feel free to use a lower heat setting if your oven has one. Some ovens go as low as 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C). Low, even heat tends to be best for drying, as it prevents food from burning. Keep in mind, however, that it can take considerably longer for your apples to dry fully at lower temperatures."

The natural citric acid will keep your apples from becoming brown and mushy while they\u2019re in the oven, but too much can actually have the opposite effect. This step is entirely optional.
