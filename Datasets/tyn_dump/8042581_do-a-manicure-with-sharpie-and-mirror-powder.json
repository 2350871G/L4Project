If you are using a non-UV gel top coat or a regular top coat, wait until it feels dry to the touch. It needs to feel rubbery, but not tacky or sticky. Applying the Mirror Powder Dip the tip of a foam, eyeshadow brush into the mirror powder. Use silver mirror powder, if you can. Sharpies are translucent, so the colors will show up the best against silver mirror powder (as opposed to other colors). Gently tap the powder onto your nail, starting from the cuticle and working your way to the tip.

If you are using a UV gel nail polish, use a no-wipe top coat. If you are using a non-UV or regular nail polish, use a water-based top coat and let it dry. Once it dries, brush on a layer of your usual top coat, and let it dry. Painting on the Sharpie Find something to use as a palette. You can use just about anything that is smooth and flat as your palette, such as a: piece of plastic, sheet of wax paper, plastic lid, or a plastic paint tray. Choose two to three colors of Sharpie. You will be blending these colors together, so pick out colors that will blend well together. Avoid contrasting colors, as they may create a muddy effect. Here are some color samples for you:\nWarm colors, such as: red, orange, yellow\nCool colors, such as: blue and purple or blue and turquoise\nAnalogous colors, such as: pink, blue, and purple. Draw patches of color on your palette. Keep some space between each color, so that they don't blend together. You will do all blending on the nail itself. Spray or drop some 91% rubbing alcohol onto the color patches. You do not need a lot of rubbing alcohol. A single spritz or a drop of rubbing alcohol will be plenty.
