Cover with plastic wrap if the bowl does not come with a cover and marinate the meat in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat.  Place the meat and marinade into a saucepan, turn the stove burner on high and bring to a boil.  Boil for 3 to 5 minutes to sanitize the meat before dehydrating.  Remove the strips of meat with a pair of tongs and let them drain on paper towels.  Oven Method Turn the oven on to the lowest setting.  Place the strips of meat directly onto the racks, leaving enough space between the strips for air flow.  Crack open the oven door 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) to further encourage air flow.  Dry the meat anywhere from 8 to 12 hours. The meat is dehydrated when it cracks but does not snap. There should be no moisture present, as this is where bacteria will grow. Storage Let the dehydrated meat cool before storing. Place the strips of meat on cooling racks. Put the meat into airtight containers or zip lock bags.  Store the dehydrated meat at room temperature for 1 to 2 months or freeze the dehydrated meat for a longer shelf life. ",
