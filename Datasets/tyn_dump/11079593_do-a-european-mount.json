The brain should be fairly soft at this point, so you can use a garden hose to clean it out if the hole is smaller and hard to get inside, If the hole is bigger, you can use a teaspoon to scrape the brains out.

Dermestid beetles are also known as flesh-eating beetles, and will clean your skull without damaging it. You can store a colony of dermestid beetles outside in an old freezer or lockable large container if you live in a warmer climate.

        "The antlers can stick out of your pot, since there isn\u2019t any tissue on them that you need boil off.",
        "Place a piece of wood across the top of your pot to hang the antlers over your pot.",
        "This will also keep the nose of your skull from breaking on the bottom of the pot.Tip: A turkey cooker is an excellent pot for boiling most deer skulls.",
        "It\u2019s a good size and tends to keep water at a simmer quite easily.",
        "Don\u2019t hang your antlers if you\u2019re using open fire to cook your skull.",
        "You\u2019ll risk starting a fire if the flames travel past the sides of your pot.",
        "Use a metal rod instead.",
        "Simmer the skull for 6-7 hours.",
        "Turn the heat to medium if you\u2019re using a regular stove or burner.",
        "Let the water heat slowly and wait for the water to simmer.",
        "If you see the water visibly boiling, turn the heat down.",
        "If it\u2019s too high, you\u2019ll risk damaging the skull or causing discoloration from the water.",
        "Check your skull every hour and add water as needed.",
        "Water will evaporate out of the pot as you\u2019re cooking the skull.",
        "Check on it every hour or so and add a little bit of water as needed to ensure that the entire skull stays submerged as you\u2019re cooking it.",
        "If the water changes color as it cooks, drain your pot and refill it.",
        "You don\u2019t want any discoloration heating into the pores of you skull.",
        "Pull the skull out of the water and shake it lightly to remove the bottom jaw.",
        "Once you\u2019ve cooked the skull for 6-7 hours, lift the skull out by the top of the antlers.",
        "Shake it up and down for 1-5 seconds and let the bottom jaw fall off into the pot.",
        "The only thing connecting the bottom jaw to the upper jaw is tissue.",
        "If the lower jaw doesn\u2019t fall off immediately, it means that you didn\u2019t cook it long enough.",
        "Try cooking it an additional hour and try again.",
        "Remove any remaining organic tissue with a power washer or hose.",
        "If you have one, use a power washer to remove excess tissue.",

        "Rinse your skull in cold water and let it dry.",
        "A thorough rinse under cold water should be more than enough at this point to remove any lingering tissue or pieces of muscle.",

        "Soak the skull in pool clarifier to keep it shiny and white.",
        "Fill a large pot with a pool clarifier or 3-5% hydrogen peroxide solution and soak your skull for 30-45 minutes.",
        "This will remove any discoloration from your skull and keep it looking shiny and white.",
        "Let it air dry for 5-6 hours after you\u2019ve soaked it.",
        "This is entirely optional.",
        "If you like the rugged look of a slightly yellowed skull, you don\u2019t need to soak it in peroxide or clarifier.",
        "Mounting Your Piece Find a stud on the wall where you want to hang your skull.",
        "You can use a stud finder to locate a stud in your wall by turning it on and running it over sections of your wall until it beeps.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a stud finder, you can tell if there\u2019s a stud in the wall based on the sound that it makes when you tap on it with a knuckle.",
        "A stud will sound flat and solid, while the area between studs will sound hollow and empty.",
        "Studs are almost always either 16 inches (41 cm) or 24 inches (61 cm) apart, so once you find one stud it should be easier to measure out the others.",
        "Hang the skull on its own with a simple screw if you don\u2019t want a wood mount.",
        "Drill a 4 in (10 cm) screw into your stud downwards at a 45-degree angle.",

        "Hold your skull so that the nose is facing downwards and carefully place the screw inside of the opening for the spinal column at the base of the skull to hang it.",
        "You can use a hook screw if you\u2019re worried about the skull slipping off of the screw.",
        "Drill a pilot hole in the base of the skull if you want to mount it to a board.",
        "Hold the skull in your hands and flip it so that the nose of the animal is facing downwards.",
        "About 2 inches (5.1 cm) directly under the opening for the spinal cord, you\u2019ll see 4 bumps facing towards the same section of bone.",
        "Drill a \u204432 in (0.24 cm) pilot hole with your power drill directly into the bone where the 4 bumps meet in the center.",
        "Use the lowest setting on your drill and go slowly so that you don\u2019t risk damaging your skull.",
        "Put a pilot hole in the section of wood where you want to mount your skull.",
        "Use your drill to punch a \u204464 in (0.28 cm) pilot hole in the location where you want to attach your skull.",
        "You can use a plaque for a more traditional look, or a piece of reclaimed wood for a more contemporary style.",
        "Any kind of wood will work, as long as it\u2019s not thicker than 2 inches (5.1 cm).",
        "Vertical plaques are commonly used to mount skulls, and can be purchased at your local craft or hardware store.",
        "Place a large pillow or rolled up blanket under your skull.",
        "On a solid work surface, lay your skull upside-down on a large pillow or rolled up blanket with the antlers hanging away at a 45-degree angle.",
        "This will give the surface of the skull some protection when you attach it to your wood and will prevent the fragile parts, like the nose and eye sockets, from getting crushed under the pressure of the drill.Tip: The bigger your antlers are, the bigger your blanket or pillow has to be.",
        "You don\u2019t want all of the weight resting on the antlers alone.",
        "Take a 3 in (7.6 cm) screw and drill it through the back of your wood.",
        "Drill it through the opposite side of the wood so that 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the screw is sticking out of the other side.",
        "Take the point of your screw and line it up with the pilot hole on your animal\u2019s skull.",
        "Drill your screw into the skull and hang your mount.",
        "With your wood in between the drill and the skull, line the point of your screw up with the pilot hole in the animal\u2019s skull.",
        "Once they\u2019re aligned, pull the trigger on your drill and screw them together.",
        "When you start to feel resistance from your screw, turn your mount over and inspect the alignment of the nose.",
        "If it has slid out of place at all, hold it back in place while you tighten the screw.",
        "Install a small D-ring or sawtooth hanger on the back of your mount to hang it on the wall.",
