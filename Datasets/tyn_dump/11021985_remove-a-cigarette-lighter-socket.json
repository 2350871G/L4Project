        "To remove it, grip it lightly between your fingers and rotate it counterclockwise.",
        "It comes free after about a quarter of a turn, so turn it slowly to avoid pulling the wires.",
        "The wire connector looks like a round plug.",
        "It is often gray, but it might be a different color in your car.",
        "The plug always has a pair of wires, green and black, that make it recognizable.",
        "Some cigarette lighter sockets have 2 different plugs.",
