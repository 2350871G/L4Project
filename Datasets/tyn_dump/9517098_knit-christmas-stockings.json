You may make the cuff of the stocking as long or as short as you like, but you may want to aim for at least 6 inches (15 cm) of length. You may change colors every couple of inches if desired, or work the cuff all in one color. Shaping the Heel Move half of the stitches onto one needle. Take \u00bc of your total stitches from the first double pointed needle and \u00bc of your total stitches from the last double pointed needle and transfer them onto 1 needle. You will then work back and forth across this needle in rows to extend the heel section of your stocking.

Take the first stitch from your needle with all of the stitches on it and slip it onto your other needle. Then, knit to the end of the row and turn your work around. Slip a stitch and purl to the end of the second row. Slip the first stitch onto the empty needle. Then, purl to the end of the row. Turn your work around again. Repeat this sequence until the heel measures 2.25 inches (5.7 cm). Keep working back and forth across the same row to extend the heel portion of the stocking. Repeat the last 2 rows until your heel piece measures 2.25 inches (5.7 cm). Slip a stitch, knit, knit 2 together, and knit 1. When your heel piece measures 2.25 inches (5.7 cm), start decreasing by 1 stitch each row. For the first row, slip 1 stitch over from the needle with all the stitches on it to the empty 1, and then knit until you only have 3 stitches left.

Repeat this sequence for 6 more rows. Repeat the last two rows in sequence for 6 more rows or a total of 8 rows. This will continue to shape the heel section of your stocking. Knit across the row. After your 8th row, knit across the row. However, do not turn the work around when you reach the end of the row. Pick up 12 stitches on side of heel section.

When you finish picking up stitches, begin knitting across the other needles. Knit all the way across the other 2 needles until you reach the other side of the heel section. Pick up 12 stitches on other side of heel section. Pick up 12 stitches along the other side of the heel section. This time, move up the side of the heel section towards the top of the heel section. Finishing the Stocking Divide stitches evenly among 3 needles again. When you have finished picking up all of the stitches for the heel, count your total number of stitches and divide them evenly among 3 needles. You may have to have 1 less or more on one of the needles to do this. For example, if you have 84 stitches, then you can place 28 stitches onto each needle. But if you end up with 85 stitches, then 1 needle will need to have 29 stitches on it and the other 2 will have 28 stitches. Knit until the foot section measures 4 inches (10 cm) or longer. When your stitches are divided evenly among the 3 needles, begin knitting in the round. This will start to form the foot section of the stocking. Knit several rounds until the foot section of your stocking is about 4 inches (10 cm) or longer. Decrease until the total number of stitches is 28. After the foot section measure about 4 inches (10 cm) from the heel, you can start to decrease the total number stitches in each round. Knit the rounds as usual, but knit 2 stitches together when you reach the last 3 stitches in the round. Then, knit 1 and repeat the round. Continue decreasing in this way until you have a total of 28 stitches. Bind off the remaining stitches. When you have 28 stitches left, bind them off.

        "Finishing the Stocking Divide stitches evenly among 3 needles again.",
        "When you have finished picking up all of the stitches for the heel, count your total number of stitches and divide them evenly among 3 needles.",
        "You may have to have 1 less or more on one of the needles to do this.",
        "For example, if you have 84 stitches, then you can place 28 stitches onto each needle.",
        "But if you end up with 85 stitches, then 1 needle will need to have 29 stitches on it and the other 2 will have 28 stitches.",
        "Knit until the foot section measures 4 inches (10 cm) or longer.",
        "When your stitches are divided evenly among the 3 needles, begin knitting in the round.",
        "This will start to form the foot section of the stocking.",
        "Knit several rounds until the foot section of your stocking is about 4 inches (10 cm) or longer.",
        "Decrease until the total number of stitches is 28.",
        "After the foot section measure about 4 inches (10 cm) from the heel, you can start to decrease the total number stitches in each round.",
        "Knit the rounds as usual, but knit 2 stitches together when you reach the last 3 stitches in the round.",
        "Then, knit 1 and repeat the round.",
        "Continue decreasing in this way until you have a total of 28 stitches.",
        "Bind off the remaining stitches.",
        "When you have 28 stitches left, bind them off.",
        "To bind off, knit the first 2 stitches in the round, then slip the first new stitch over the second new stitch.",
        "As you do this, let the first stitch to slip off the then of the needle.",
        "Then, knit 1 and slip the first stitch over the second stitch again.",
        "Repeat this until you have worked all of the stitches off of your needles.",
        "Make sure to leave a long tail (12 inches (30 cm) or longer) so that you can use the tail yarn to weave the toe opening closed.",
        "Sew the opening closed.",
        "Thread the tail yarn through the eye of the yarn needle.",
        "Then, begin sewing the opening closed.",
        "Match up the bound off stitches and sew through 2 at a time to close up the opening.",
        "When you get to the end, insert the needle into the inside of the stocking\u2019s toe and then-then turn the stocking inside out to secure it from the inside and hide the knot."
