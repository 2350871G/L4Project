You can also cover the pot briefly -- the steam will condense on the sides of the pot, dissolving the sugar and dripping back into the mixture. Clamp a candy thermometer into the mixture and wait until it reads 300\u2109. This is the \"hard crack\" stage of candy. This means that, when it cools, the candy will break up into the hard pieces of toffee that you are looking for. Turn the heat off when the thermometer reads 300\u2109. If you do not have a candy thermometer, the toffee is done when the mixture is a rich golden-amber color, similar to the skin of an almond. Do not let it get brown, however, as this means it is burning. Turn off the heat and quickly stir in 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. This ensures that you get the extract throughout the mixture evenly, but don't cause any more crystals to form. 3-4 stirs around should be enough. Carefully pour the toffee onto your baking sheet. You'll leave it on your baking sheet to cool and harden, then you can break it up into smaller pieces afterward. If you want nuts in your toffee, spread them on the sheet ahead of time and pour the toffee over them. Cool the toffee in the freezer for 20-30 minutes. You can then remove it, crack it into pieces, and serve. Toffee will last for 7-10 days in an air-tight container at room temperature and up to a month in the freezer. Making Variations Add 2 cups of chocolate chips to the toffee right after pouring it out into the pan.

Sweet, salty, and savory, bacon toffee is hard to resist. To make it, simply fry, dry, and finely chop 1lb of bacon. Then lay the small pieces on your baking pan and pour the toffee over them.
