    "text": " Playing Staccato Place the bow in your hand in the pronate position. Make sure you have your bow length at the bottom to the middle section of the bow. To pronate your hand, turn it down and out towards the left side. Accent your sound. To do staccato you will need part of your sound to be accented. Simply slightly jerk the bow in a fast and short way. Accenting is important to do so that the staccato sound comes out nicely sharp and clean. Practice this technique quite a bit. Don't make it too jerky. Instead, use a fast short weighty bowing technique. Always make sure that when playing staccato you have lots of arm weight. Do not use pressure on your bow. Instead, relax and use the weight of your arm. Playing Legato Start off with a less pronated position and have your bow at the frog of the bow (near the part where you hold the bow.) Make sure your bow has the proper direction when playing. For this technique you use a lot of rosin. Make sure you use cello bow rosin. Use less arm weight and move your hand slowly along the strings. When moving your cello bow across the strings, count the time signature in your head. Keep your shoulder and elbow up. Make sure your feet are on the floor, and you are sitting on the edge of your chair. Play the legato notes slowly.

Set your metronome under 85. Fast legato is known as sweeping stroke (See the last technique). Make it sound smooth. You can do this by:\nNot having pressure on the bow and having a relaxed bow hand. Going near the bridge of your cello (as shown in the picture above where the bridge is located) and slowly move the bow along. Having proper cello position. Playing Jet\u00e9 Make sure your hand is pronated. Have the bow at the middle tip. Make sure your bow is in the right 'bow direction'. (A picture of a pronated hand is above) Lift the bow in the air. Let it drop on the string and bounce. This will make the 'jet\u00e9' sound. Make sure it starts to bounce on the middle-tip part of the bow. Do not apply pressure on the bow when doing this.
