Performing With Ableton Have the screen open on Session view and label each track. When you open Ableton, the default view is session view. If you are using a grid based controller, you should see a colored box outlining specific clips that the controller is viewing. Populate the Session with audio and/or MIDI clips. To make performing easier, keep each clip consistent to the same length (ie. 4, 8, or 16 bars). Group similar clips together onto the same track (drums, bass, synths, etc. ).

Set the follow action to play the next clip after a desired amount of bars have passed. For example, if the clip is 8 bars long, set the follow action to take place after 8 bars have passed). Select the drop down menu below the follow action and pick \"next.\" This will play the next adjacent sequential clip after the current clip has finished playing. Add a Limiter on the Master track. This will prevent digital audio clipping during playback of your clips. On the left side of the screen, select audio effects. Drag a Limiter onto the Master channel. Launch clips from Session view. To launch a clip, simply click on it. To launch an entire row of clips (scene), click on the scene launch button. Use your DJ controller to experiment with launching clips from different songs or sections simultaneously. Grid based controllers will make launching clips extremely easy. Add effect racks to different channels and experiment using them. Ableton has preset effect racks under Audio Effects > DJ & Performance. Simply drag the effect rack onto the desired channel.
