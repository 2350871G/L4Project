The arc is established between the wire and the base metal. Often times an inert gas is used, which flows out of the gas nozzle to shield the welding process from the atmosphere. There are several modes of metal transfer:\nShort circuit (thin metals)\nGlobular transfer (heavier metals)\nSpray transfer (hottest)"
