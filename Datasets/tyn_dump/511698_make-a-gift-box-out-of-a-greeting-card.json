The easiest way to make the top fit over the bottom is to make sure both halves of the card are the same size, so you may have to trim a little. You will use the colorful front of the card as the box lid. Decide how tall you want your box to be. This may depend on the design on the front of the card, or on how big the item is that you want to enclose. This demonstration uses 1 inch (25mm) for the top, and 1 and 1/16 (27mm) for the bottom. Add a little to the measurement for the bottom, so the top will fit over it. Draw a square in each corner of the top and bottom of the card, the size of your measurements. You can mark just the corners, making a square so you can see where to cut. Score the card all the way along all four sides, using the squares to give you the distance from the edge.  Cut along the score line from the edge to the next, perpendicular score line in each corner, but do so for only one side of the square you drew. Leave one side of the box uncut to make a tab. Do this for all four corners of the card. Fold the sides up, and fold the tabs in.  Glue each tab and paper clip it into place until it dries.  Repeat the marking and scoring for the other half of the box.  When your box is dry, place your gift or other small objects inside.  Square gift or trinket box using an old card Cut the card apart and keep the bottom half for the bottom of your box.  Cut a square out of the front of the card. Use the shorter edge as your measure, or decide what part of the image you want on top of your box. Make this the center of your square. Draw a diagonal X on the back side of the card from corner to corner. Do not fold. Fold one corner to meet the center of the X. Make a crisp crease. Fold the same corner up once again, aligning the folded edge with the center line. Then unfold. Repeat for the remaining 3 corners, making crisp creases. Unfold when done. Fold in 2 opposing corners so they meet point-to-point in the center of your square. This makes 2 large triangular shapes, pointing toward the center. Make 4 careful cuts along the crease line, from the edges, up to the next crease mark. Stop just short of cutting the triangular piece. Cut carefully to the intersection of the creases for a nice straight edge on your box. Unfold when done. Fold the other 2 opposing corners so they meet in the center. Turn the two cut flaps up and in, then fold the remaining flat sides up and over the top of the flaps, tucking it down inside your box. It should hold by itself. Repeat for the other side of the box. For bottom of box, cut the square 1/4 \" smaller than the top. This will allow for the box to fit together nicely, without being too tight. Repeat the steps to make the bottom of the box.  Decorate. If using construction or cardstock paper in solid colors, decorate as you wish. Hint: Use a small amount of glue stick to help hold the inside of the boxes down if needed. Add some tissue paper or cotton balls as padding for small gifts or jewelry. Use yarn or ribbon and add a bow.",
