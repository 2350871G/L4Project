Steam rollers will work the best on straight hair, but you can try using them to define curly or wavy hair. If you have natural or kinky hair, however, you will need to start with a blow-out. Otherwise, the curls will not have as much definition. Apply a heat protectant to your hair. Even though steam rollers are much gentler on your hair than regular hot rollers, they still use some heat. Apply your favorite heat protectant evenly throughout your hair. If you need to, use a comb to help distribute it. Set up the tank. Fill the tank with cool to room-temperature water up to fill line and replace the lid. Set it down on a stable surface and plug it in. Turn the tank on and wait for the steam to form. It will take about 1 minute before you start seeing steam come out of the lid. How much water you use depends on the size of the tank. Place the first roller into slot on top of the tank. Wait 3 to 5 seconds for it to soak up the steam. Some manufacturers may recommend up to 7 seconds. It's okay if you go over that time, but be aware that it may take longer for your hair to dry. Using the Rollers Take a small section of hair from the top of your head. Grab a 1 to 2-inch (2.54 to 5.08-centimeter) wide, horizontal section of hair. If you are using a smaller hair roller, can use a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) section of hair. Then, clip the rest of your hair out of the way before using a roller. If your hair is natural or kinky, take a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) section and smooth your hair with a comb. Wrap your hair around the roller.

Hold the roller in place while you wait for the cap to steam. If your hair is natural or kinky, leave the cap on for 10 seconds. Place the cap over the roller. This will secure the roller to your head and keep it from moving. You are now ready to move onto the next roller and section of hair. Continue curling your hair.

For natural or kinky hair, continue to use the largest roller size in the kit. If you use the smaller rollers without blowing out your hair first, your hair may turn out frizzy. Finishing and Setting the Style Leave the rollers in your hair for 20 minutes. If you can't wait that long, you can blow dry your hair using a cold setting for about 1 minute. Your hair must be completely dry and cool before you move on, otherwise the curls may come out. Keep in mind that the longer you leave the rollers in, the tighter the curls will be.
