Swipe the pad all over your face to tone your skin. Brush the soaked cotton ball or pad over your clean face. Your skin should feel wet for a few seconds, but the witch hazel will dry quickly. Concentrate on specific areas to soothe irritation and acne. Because witch hazel can cleanse and calm irritated skin, brush it over oily or acne-prone areas. For example, swipe a soaked cotton pad over your T-zone (the center of your forehead and nose) if it's oily. Use witch hazel on your skin 1 to 2 times per day.
