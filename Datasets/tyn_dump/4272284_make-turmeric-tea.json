    "text": " Preparing the Ingredients Choose your turmeric. Ground turmeric is more widely available that the fresh variety. Nonetheless, fresh turmeric can often be found at farmers\u2019 markets, larger grocery stores, health food stores, and Asian markets. To mince fresh turmeric, peel it with a small spoon and then grate it on a Microplane or on the smallest holes of a box grater. You can also mince it with a large kitchen knife. Choose your optional ingredients. Ginger is the most common flavor addition to turmeric tea. Cinnamon is another popular option. Both, like turmeric, are hailed as anti-inflammatories. When choosing an herbal teabag, look for lemongrass. Prepare the optional ingredients. Grinding the dried spices will result in more potent flavors. Prepare fresh ginger in the same manner as you would the turmeric. Peel it with a spoon. Then, grate in on a Microplane or box grater. Cinnamon sticks can be added whole. Or, for a stronger flavor, you can grind them in mortar and pestle or a clean coffee grinder. Black pepper can be added whole or ground. Cayenne pepper can be added for some extra kick and a small metabolism boost. Brewing the Tea Bring the water to a boil in a small saucepan or kettle.  Add the turmeric directly to the boiling water. Add any optional ingredients, except the milk, at this time. If using an herbal tea bag, do not add it yet. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes. Simmering happens at a lower temperature than boiling. Review the process here: How to Simmer Remove the saucepan from the heat. Do this carefully. The contents of the pan will be very hot!
