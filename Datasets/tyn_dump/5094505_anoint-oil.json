The most common restriction regards who may bless or anoint the oil. In some denominations, such as in Catholicism, only a priest or similar clergyman can bless the oil. Some denominations even limit which clergymen are authorized to consecrate oil. It is also important to note that some denominations, such as the Latter Day Saints, also have guidelines and laws concerning what oil should be consecrated and how it can be used afterward."

However, it should be olive oil instead of another type of oil since it has greater traditional and biblical significance because it is mentioned in religious texts. Unless you are told otherwise by a religious authority, it is not necessary to buy special oil for anointing. Extra-virgin cold-pressed olive oil is the purest variety available, so many people prefer to use that when shopping for an anointing oil. You can find this oil in the vast majority of grocery stores. If desired, you can buy scented olive oil from a religious or secular store.

You can buy a special oil stock at a religious bookstore or online, or you could use any small bottle. The most common vial is a short metal container with a screw-on lid, with a sponge placed inside to help hold the oil in. However, less expensive plastic oil stocks are also available.

The prayer should be firm and one made in good faith. The prayer you use must ask God to bless and cleanse the oil, so that it can be used for the sake of God's glory. For instance, the prayer might be something like, \"God, I pray that you anoint this oil in Your heavenly name. I pray that You cleanse it of any defilement in it or upon it, and that You make it holy for the work of Your glory. May this be done in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
