        "Set your two trusses flat on your workspace so that each lay parallel.",
        "Then, take your popsicle sticks, laying several crosswise between each of your trusses.",
        "These will form the deck, or the road, that runs the length of your bridge between the truss walls.",
        "Lay out popsicle sticks until your deck stretches the distance of the trusses.",
        "The distance between your crosswise popsicle stick deck will determine the width of your bridge deck.",
        "Be sure that all of your popsicle sticks are even, otherwise the deck leading over your bridge will look irregular.",
        "Anchor your deck with staggered lengthwise supports.",
        "Larger sized popsicle provide more stability, but smaller popsicle sticks should work just fine if you don't have any larger ones on hand.",
        "Lay your sticks in a staggered formation lengthwise to join your deck into one, continuous piece.",
        "Once your deck supports are in position, use your hot glue gun or some other suitable glue to fasten your supports in place.",
        "If you are using wood glue or general purpose glue, allow some time for the glue to dry before handling the deck.",
        "Measure for cradle supports for your deck and truss joiners.",
        "Take your yardstick or ruler and measure the length of your deck.",
        "You'll need to created union braces for your deck to rest upon.",
        "These will also connect the walls of your trusses crosswise together.",
        "Take the measure of your deck and the thickness of either truss.",
        "Cut your cradle supports and truss joiners.",
        "If you have popsicle sticks of assorted sizes, you may be able to use this, so long as it is as long or longer than the total width of your deck and both trusses.",
        "If you are using a yardstick or ruler and your deck/truss measurements, you'll need to:\nMultiply the width of your truss measurement by two to account for the width of both trusses and then add the width of the deck.",
        "Cut three or four popsicle sticks to this length.",
        "If your popsicle sticks are too short, make a longer one.",
        "Cut two sticks and, with glue, join each by attaching another stick to the bottom for support.",
        "Putting It All Together Unite the truss walls.",
        "You may want to consider having a friend help you for this part of the bridge assembly, or you might use books to lean your trusses up against to make gluing more manageable.",
        "You should:\nSecure the first two deck cradle beams within the cross braces of the trusses at both ends of the bridge.",
        "Use your glue to attach your cradle beams on the truss beam.",
        "Hold the glue firmly until it sets and is well bonded to the truss.",
        "Lay additional deck support beams as needed.",
        "The more braces you add and the more triangles you create with the frame of your bridge, the stronger it will be.",
        "Use your glue to add additional deck cradle beams to support the truss walls.",
        "Attach your deck, if desired.",
        "You may want to leave your deck loose, so that you can show off every aspect of your bridge's construction.",
        "However, if you want the deck connected to the cradle beams, simply add glue to the cradle beams and lay your deck into place.",
        "Try to move quickly during this step, especially if using hot glue.",
        "It would be unfortunate if the glue dried before you were able to lay the deck into place.",
        "Add upper support beams.",
        "If you have long popsicle sticks, you can simply lay these across the top of the struts and then glue each into place.",
        "However, if your popsicle sticks aren't long enough, you may make longer ones.",
        "Cut a few and join these into a longer stick using a stick glued to the bottom as support.",
        "Equal distance spacing will give the appearance of the real thing."
