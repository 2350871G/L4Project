            "description": "If the muffler has a hole, it can cause dangerous gases such as carbon monoxide to leak into the cabin of a vehicle. This colorless, odorless gas is a product of the combustion process. Mild exposure to carbon monoxide can cause headaches, dizziness, and nausea. Prolonged carbon monoxide exposure can lead to unconsciousness and death. Many homeowners' associations, cities, restaurants, and apartment complexes have laws against loud noises from defective mufflers. If you have a broken muffler, you may face fines or refusal of service until you get the muffler fixed. A damaged muffler can cause a car trip to be noisy and uncomfortable."
