The corn muffin mix most likely already contains salt and flour in the pre-made ingredients. When adding extra salt and/or flour, you may not want to add too much. Crack 1 egg into an empty mixing bowl. You can decide of course whether or not you will be using the egg whites, yolk, or the entire egg. Add 1/3 cup of mayonnaise to the egg bowl.
