Proper pH levels allow chlorine to kill bacteria and algae. A water testing kit can determine the chemical levels of your pool, and can be purchased from a pool professional. Regular testing will help you ensure the liner lasts for many years to come and that your water is kept at a safe and healthy level for your swimmers. A pH level of between 7.4 \u2013 7.8 helps the liner from wrinkling or eye and skin irritation occurring to swimmers. A pH level of between 7.4 \u2013 7.8 helps the liner from wrinkling or eye and skin irritation occurring to swimmers. Total alkalinity should be between 100-150ppm. Saturation index should be between -0.1 to +0.4. Free chlorine should sit between 1-3ppm to prevent algae and bacteria from thriving. Never combine the chemicals; add chemicals to pool water separately and circulate them throughout the pool. Allow one chemical to dissolve throughout the pool before adding the second chemical."

When you choose one that tightly fits your pool, no foreign materials can enter from the top or the sides when the pool isn\u2019t in use. A good pool cover will reduce the amount of water evaporating from your pool (saving on water costs), will reduce how much cleaning you will need to do and will prevent staining of the liner from leaves and dirt entering the pool. Certain pool covers can even help heat the pool as well. Uncover the pool a few weeks before it's warm enough to swim and put in the correct amount of chemicals to clear the water over time."
