If you have virgin hair, you can usually go a few shades lighter with a high-lift boxed dye. Going from dark brown hair to blonde with hair dye alone is probably unrealistic, but you can definitely lighten up virgin hair without bleach. For example, if you have light brown hair that\u2019s never been dyed, you can dye it blonde without using bleach. If you have dark brown virgin hair, you can dye it light brown or red without using bleach. Buy the dye that depicts the hair color you want to achieve on the box; you don't need to amend anything to account for darker hair as long as it's virgin."

Get as close to the roots as possible without touching your scalp. Once the section is saturated with the mixture, clip it back up and out of the way. Work as quickly as you can, since the bleach mixture loses strength the longer it sits out. The bleach will still work if you let it sit out for a few hours, but it will take longer to process your hair and generally be less effective.
