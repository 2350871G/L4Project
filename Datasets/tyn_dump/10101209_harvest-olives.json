Olives typically start as green olives and get darker as they become riper. Ripe purplish colored olives are less bitter and pungent than green olives. Green olives are also firmer than ripe olives. Ripe olives have a shorter shelf life than underripe varieties. Your olives may ripen at different times depending on the variety, temperature, amount of sunlight, and irrigation. Overripe olives are mushy and shriveled. Discard any olives that appear overripe."
