To help it accomplish this, put the lock washer on first, below the fastener. If your project calls for other washers or hardware elements, they should go on before the lock washer so that it can hold them in place. Make sure your washer is tight against the fastener and other surface. To operate correctly, your lock washer must press against both the threaded fastener and the other adjacent surface, creating a tight connection. If the connection isn\u2019t tight, press the fastener down until it is. This is particularly important when dealing with lock nuts, which require that that grooves of a toothed washer lock together with the grooves of the nut. Tighten your threaded fastener. For small, general purpose jobs, tighten your nut or threaded fastener by turning a wrench or ratchet clockwise. Do this until the fastener is firm but can be loosened if necessary.

For split washers, make sure that the washer is slightly out of alignment, indicating that it is exerting tension on the threaded fastener. If the washer is not operating correctly, loosen the nut or threaded fastener and fix the washer. Removing Lock Washers Remove the nut or threaded fastener holding the washer in place. For most nuts and fasteners, you can attach a simple wrench or vise-grip to the object and turn it counter-clockwise.

Picking a Lock Washer Use a split lock washer for small jobs. A split lock washer, also known as a helical spring washer, is the most common form of lock washer.
