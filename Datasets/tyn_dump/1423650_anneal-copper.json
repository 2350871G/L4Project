Wear a pair of goggles that are rated to at least shade 4 to adequately block the bright acetylene flame from harming your eyes. If you don't wear safety goggles, you could risk seriously damaging your eyes by looking directly at the acetylene flame. Goggles used for annealing, arc cutting, and welding are rated on a scale of 2\u201314, with 2 as the least tinted and 14 as the most tinted. Since an acetylene torch is much less bright than a welding torch, your eyes will be protected by relatively lightly tinted glasses. If you do not own a pair of safety goggles, purchase a pair at a large hardware store or a welding-supply store."

You'll also adjust the amount of oxygen coming from the tank to control the intensity of the flame. Before you begin, make sure that the 2 pressure gauges on the oxygen tank and the 2 pressure gauges on the acetylene tank are all at \u201c0.\u201d\nIf you don't already have an oxygen acetylene torch, you can purchase or rent one from a large hardware store or a home-improvement store."

        "Pick up the annealed copper with a pair of pliers.",
        "At this point, the copper will be incredibly hot, so you obviously cannot pick it up with your bare hands.",
        "So, slip 1 of the jaws of a pair of pliers under the edge of the copper bar or pipe, squeeze the pliers tightly shut, and pick up the annealed copper.",
        "If you don't already have a pair of pliers, purchase a pair at a local hardware store.",
        "You don't need to wear gloves at this point (or at any other point during the annealing process), since you'll never touch the metal directly until it's cool.",
        "In a pinch, you could use a pair of ordinary tweezers to pick up the superheated copper.",
        "Just be careful not to drop it!",
        "Deposit the annealed copper into a metal bucket of water.",
        "This will cause the red-hot copper to immediately lose heat and cool off.",
        "Keep an eye on the copper so you can gauge its temperature.",
        "Once the metal returns to its original reddish-brown color, use the pliers to remove the copper from the metal bucket.",
        "The cooling process should take less than 5 minutes.",
        "Once this time has passed, the copper is now annealed and will be soft and malleable for working.",
        "It's important that you use a metal bucket to cool the heated metal, since it could potentially melt through a plastic bucket."
