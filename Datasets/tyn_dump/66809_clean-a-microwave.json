Then, you can add 2 to 3 citrus slices or 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vinegar to the water. If your microwave is really dirty, consider adding both the citrus and the vinegar. You can use any type of vinegar, such as plain white vinegar or apple cider vinegar. Try adding slices of lemon, orange, or lime.

The baking soda will absorb the smells as the water heats.Tip: If you'd like to remove undesirable smells from the microwave while making your machine smell better, you can also add 2 to 3 slices of citrus with the water and baking soda before you microwave it. Put a wooden skewer into the bowl. If you're going to heat the water in a perfectly smooth bowl, the microwave can superheat the liquid and cause the bowl to burst. To prevent the liquid from superheating, add a wooden skewer or wooden spoon to the bowl. Avoid putting a metal skewer or spoon into the bowl since it can overheat and scorch your microwave. Microwave the solution on \"high\" for 5 minutes. Place the bowl with the skewer on the microwave's turntable and close the door. Microwave the solution for 5 minutes so the water begins to boil and create steam. Wait 5 minutes to open the microwave so the steam can loosen grime. If you open the microwave immediately, the steam will escape and your cleaning solution will be incredibly hot. Instead, wait 5 minutes before you open the door. Scrubbing the Inside of the Microwave Remove the solution and turntable before washing it with soapy water. Take out the bowl of solution and lift the turntable off of its track. Remove the turntable and wash both sides of it with soapy water. Put the clean turntable on the counter while you clean the inside of the microwave. If the bowl is still hot after 5 minutes, wear oven mitts to remove it. If the turntable is really greasy or has burnt-on stains, you could soak it in a sink full of soapy water while you clean the inside of the microwave. Scrub the bottom, sides, top, and door of the interior with a sponge or cloth. Since food often splatters in every direction, you'll need to spend some time wiping down every interior surface. Dip a sponge or cloth into the cleaning solution you made earlier and use it to wipe away all of the grease and food remnants.Tip: If the door is greasy, you could spray the inner glass door with grease-cutting product before scrubbing it.

You should also wipe the top and bottom of the machine until the entire interior is dry. Put the turntable back into the microwave. Place the clean turntable in the bottom of the machine so it rests on its tracks. If it's not on the tracks, the turntable will appear tilted or it may not rotate properly when the machine is on. Removing Stubborn Stains Rub away grease stains using a baking soda paste. Mix together enough baking soda and water to make a spreadable paste. Then, rub the paste with a cloth over the greasy areas before you wipe it away with a wet cloth. If there's a lot of grease, consider spraying the inside with a grease-cutting product. Wipe away yellow stains with nail polish remover. If you have an older microwave, it's probably got yellow stains from years of use but these are easy to remove with a little nail polish. Dip a cotton ball in acetone nail polish remover and rub the yellow stains until they lift. To remove the harsh acetone smell, wipe the microwave down with a damp cloth. Scrub scorch marks with a sponge soaked with vinegar and baking soda. All it takes is burning 1 bag of popcorn and your microwave will be left with scorch marks. Fortunately, you can usually scrub these away by soaking a sponge in vinegar and sprinkling an even layer of baking soda over it. Rub the rougher side of the sponge over the marks until they're removed. You can also try lifting the stains by rubbing a cotton ball soaked in acetone over them. Polishing the Outside Dip a cloth into soapy water and wring it out. Fill a bowl or the sink with warm soapy water and drop a dishcloth into it. Swish the cloth around so it absorbs the soapy water. Then, wring most of the soapy water out of the cloth. You can use liquid dishwashing soap to make the soapy water. Use the cloth to wipe the top, sides, and display panel.

You'll probably have to spend a little extra time on the display panel since this can become sticky with a lot of use. You'll also need to wipe around the handle, which can be grimy.
