Between each set of inner pipe cleaners, twist an additional one around the 2 outer rungs. To secure the pipe cleaners around the rungs, simply pinch the 2 sides together near the base of the wreath and twist them together 2 to 3 times. It doesn\u2019t matter what color of pipe cleaner you use because they won\u2019t be visible when you\u2019re finished with the project. In all, you\u2019ll use 12 pipe cleaners\u20146 will go around the inside of the wreath, and 6 will go around the outside. You can buy a wreath that already has the pipe cleaners, or connectors, attached to it, but it\u2019s a lot less expensive to buy the pieces separately and assemble it yourself."

Remove the deco mesh from their rolls, and gather the ends together. Seal them in a bottom-rung pipe cleaner to start your wreath. Don\u2019t be afraid to get creative with the deco mesh fabrics. You can really use any combination of colors that you like. A purple, black, and orange wreath would look nice, as would one that was just orange and black.

For example, you could try black ribbon on the inner section of deco mesh and purple on the outer section, or you could mix a patterned ribbon with a plain-colored ribbon.

You can also stick some small plastic spiders into the actual webbing itself. Use a ribbon to hang the embroidery hoop from a door.

        "Don\u2019t be afraid to get creative with the deco mesh fabrics.",
        "You can really use any combination of colors that you like.",
        "A purple, black, and orange wreath would look nice, as would one that was just orange and black.",
        "Deco mesh can be bought at the craft store, but you can also sometimes find it at dollar stores.",
        "Bunch up the deco mesh between the first and second pipe cleaners.",
        "Use about 6 inches (15 cm) of material between each pipe cleaner for a full, festive looking wreath.",
        "Twist the second pipe cleaner around itself several times to hold the deco mesh in place.",
        "How big you make each bunch is up to you\u2014the bigger the bunch, the fuller your wreath will look.",
        "Repeat this process all the way around the outer pipe cleaners.",
        "Try your best to make each bunch equal in size.",
        "Do your work from a standing position, if you can, so that you can visualize what the wreath will look like when someone sees it hanging from your front door.",
        "Remember to twist the pipe cleaners several times around each section so that the material stays firmly in place.",
        "Take your time and make sure the deco mesh is laying the way you want it to.",
        "It\u2019s harder to make adjustments once the material is tied down, so doing it as you go is the best idea.",
        "Cut off the excess material once you\u2019ve brought it back to the beginning.",
        "End your deco mesh at the same pipe cleaner at which you started it.",
        "Twist the pipe cleaner around the material again, and then use a pair of scissors to cut off the extra deco mesh.",
        "Don\u2019t throw away the excess material, as you\u2019ll use it for the inner section of the wreath, too.",
        "Attach the deco mesh to the inner-set of pipe cleaners.",
        "Repeat the bunching and tying steps you did around the outside.",
        "Firmly twist each pipe cleaner around the bunch of deco mesh so that it stays in the right shape.",
        "Stop once you\u2019ve brought the material back to the first pipe cleaner, and trim away the excess material.",
        "Periodically check the bunches as you secure them to the wreath.",
        "You want them to be equal in size.",
        "Lay the colored ribbon out around the wreath.",
        "For this part of the craft, you could use orange, black, purple, or green ribbon, or find some fun Halloween-patterned ribbon to use.",
        "Cut off about 2 feet (24 in) of each ribbon, and drape it around the wreath to decide where you want to place each color and how you want it to lay.",
        "After you lay it out, step back and look at it, and then make any adjustments.",
        "Keep doing this until you achieve the look you like best.",
        "For example, you could try black ribbon on the inner section of deco mesh and purple on the outer section, or you could mix a patterned ribbon with a plain-colored ribbon.",
        "Don\u2019t secure the ribbon to the wreath yet.",
        "Use this time to try a few different arrangements.",
        "Secure the ribbon in place by twisting the pipe cleaners around it.",
        "Once you\u2019ve decided how you want the ribbon to look, twist the pipe cleaners around it at every outer and inner interval.",
        "If you\u2019re using any ribbon that is colored or patterned on one side only, make sure that the plain side is facing down and can\u2019t be seen when you look at the wreath head on.",
        "If you decide you don\u2019t like the look of the ribbon, that\u2019s okay.",
        "You definitely don\u2019t have to use it if you don\u2019t want to.",
        "Twist the pipe cleaners so the ends are at the back of the wreath.",
        "After the ribbon is in place where you want it, it\u2019s time to hide the ends of those straggling pipe cleaners.",
        "Pull the ends back through the rungs so that they\u2019re coming out of the back of the wreath.",
        "Twist them around several times, then snip off the excess material.",
        "Twisting the pipe cleaners again in the back gives a little extra security to your wreath.",
        "If you want, you could even add some hot glue to the final twist.",
        "Cut off 12 3 in (7.6 cm) pieces of mesh to cover the pipe cleaners.",
        "Use pieces that are all the same color, or mix-and-match for a fun visual effect.",
        "Pair one piece of mesh with each pipe cleaner.",
        "Wrap the mesh over the visible pipe cleaner, and tie it off in the back.",
        "Repeat this until all 12 pipe cleaners are covered.",
        "If you like the color of the pipe cleaners you used, or if they aren\u2019t visible because of how full your wreath is, then you can skip this step.",
        "Decorate your wreath with add-on Halloween objects.",
        "You can find mini pumpkins, plastic bats, skeletons, spiders, and other fun Halloween items at the craft store or dollar store.",
        "Position these however you\u2019d like around the wreath.",
        "Use your hot-glue gun to glue everything into place.",
        "For example, you could place several small pumpkins at regular intervals around the wreath.",
        "Try out several arrangements before you actually glue anything into place.",
        "For large or heavy items, you may want to glue a pipe cleaner to the bottom of the object and then use that to secure it to the wreath.",
        "Allow the glue to dry, then hang up your wreath and enjoy!",
        "Hot glue doesn\u2019t take long to dry, just a couple of minutes usually.",
        "Hang the wreath by using an over-the-door wreath hanger, a nail, or even a command hook.",
        "Put a small Halloween sign in the center of your wreath for a fun addition.",
        "If you notice any sagging decorations after the wreath has been hung, just add some super glue to the object to help it stay in place.",

        "Let the glue dry, and then hang the wreath up on your front door.",

        "Create a mummy wreath for a simple, yet cute, craft.",
        "For this project, use a wreath base that is made of foam.",

        "Rip the cheesecloth into 3 in (7.6 cm) strips and wrap them loosely around the wreath base.",
        "Secure them into place with the glue gun.",
        "Leave a small gap on the side, and glue down a pair of googly eyes to make it look like a creature is peeking out of the cloth.",
        "If you can\u2019t find a foam wreath, use a straw one instead.",
        "Wrap a foam base in gray twine to create a bat-themed wreath.",

        "Get a few bags of candy corn, a foam wreath, a hot glue gun, ribbon, and black duct tape.",
        "Cover the wreath entirely in the black duct tape to create a background for the candy corn.",
        "Use your glue gun to add the candy corn to the wreath.",
        "Once the glue is dry, use the ribbon to hang the wreath from the door.",
        "For the candy corn, use whatever kind of pattern you like best.",
        "You could alternate rows of candy corn going in different directions, or make a herringbone pattern.",
        "The candy corn will no longer be safe to eat because of the glue, so make sure to keep it out of the reach of small children.",
