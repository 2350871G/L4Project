Your hair will be much easier to braid when it is moisturized and free of tangles. Examples of oils or butters you can use to keep your hair moisturized and tangle-free are coconut oil, argan oil, jojoba oil, shea butter, or aloe butter products. Check the natural hair care aisle at a pharmacy or beauty supply store to find these products. If your natural hair is tightly coiled, you may also want to blow dry your hair before you start braiding. Blow drying will help stretch out your curls and give your cornrows a neater look."
