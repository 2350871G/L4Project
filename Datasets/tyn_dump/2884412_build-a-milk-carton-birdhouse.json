Be sure to rinse away all soapy residue, then let the carton dry completely. For best results, use a \u20442 gallon (1.9 L) or 1 gallon (3.8 L) carton. Small, single serving milk cartons aren't large enough to use as birdhouses.Tip: You can also order unused empty milk cartons online.

The hole will allow birds to enter the birdhouse. The right size for the hole depends on the birds in your area. For most wrens and songbirds, a 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm) hole is ideal. If you want to attract larger birds, such as screech owls, make the hole 3 in (7.6 cm) in diameter. Use caution with blades and other sharp objects. If necessary, have an adult help you cut the carton. To trace a perfect circle, use the bottom of a measuring cup, bottle cap, or other round object that\u2019s 1 \u20442 to 3 in (3.8 to 7.6 cm) in diameter."

Hanging birdhouse at least 5 feet (1.5 m) above the ground will help keep out snakes, insects, and other predators and pests.
