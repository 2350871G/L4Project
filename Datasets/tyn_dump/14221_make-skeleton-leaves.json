        "The water will get rid of any excess bleach and stop the bleaching process Allow the leaves to dry.",
        "If you want the leaves to dry flat, place them between two sheets of paper towel, then stack some heavy books on top of them.",
        "If you want more natural-looking leaves, allow them to dry on a paper towel without anything on top.",
        "Without anything weighing them down, the leaves will curl and warp slightly as they dry.",
        "This process should take about 20 minutes.",
        "Soak the leaves in food coloring or liquid watercolor for a dyed effect.",
        "Mix water with enough food coloring or liquid watercolor to get the shade you want.",
        "Soak the leaves in the solution for up to 20 minutes, then lift them out.",
        "Rinse them in fresh water, then left them dry using the same method as before:\nIf you want flat leaves, sandwich them between paper towels, then stack books on them.",
        "If you want natural leaves, let them dry on a paper towel.",
        "Paint the leaves with liquid watercolor or food coloring.",
        "Pour your desired colors into small cups or caps.",
        "Use a soft, watercolor paintbrush to paint the leaves with the dye.",
        "You can paint the leaves a solid color, or you can paint bands to create an ombre effect.",
        "Let the leaves dry between two books when you are done.",
        "Avoid using brushes with stiff bristles; they can damage the leaf skeletons.",
        "Spray paint the leaves if you want a metallic effect.",
        "Set the leaves down onto a paper towel.",
        "Lightly spray them with metallic spray paint.",
        "Use a pair of tweezers to lift the leaves up.",
        "Transfer them to a clean paper towel, and let them dry.",
        "Repeat the process for the other side.",
        "Don't let the leaves dry on the spray painted paper towel, or they will stick.",
        "Use floral spray paint for even better results.",
        "Decorating or Using the Leaves Add some bling with seed beads, glitter, or rhinestones.",
        "Outline the leaf and/or the center stem with liquid glue, then sprinkle on extra-fine scrapbooking glitter.",
        "You can also use tiny, glass seed beads or tiny rhinestones instead.",
        "Alternatively, you can draw designs onto the leaves using glitter glue.",
        "School glue or craft glue with a small tip will work the best for this.",
        "You can also paint the glue on using a thin, pointed paintbrush.",
        "Don't use the regular kind of glitter.",
        "It will be too chunky for this project.",
        "Use dried leaves to make a bowl or box.",
        "Cover your bowl or box with plastic wrap.",
        "Mix equal amounts of school glue and warm water.",
        "Dip the leaves into the glue, then smooth them onto the bowl or box.",
        "Let them dry, then lift the leaves off; peel away any plastic wrap stuck to the leaves.",
        "Add a sprinkle of extra-fine glitter to the glue for some sparkle.",
        "If you don't have school glue, you can try craft/tacky glue or decoupage glue (ie: Mod Podge).",
        "Use the leaves in scrapbooking and card making.",
        "You can glue the leaves to cards and scrapbooking paper using a glue stick.",
        "You can also paint the back of the leaf with a thin layer of liquid glue, and stick it to the project instead.",
        "For a fancier touch, use a shaped hole puncher or a craft blade to use an interesting shape (ie: heart, star, moon, etc) out of the middle of the leaf.",
        "You can also use the leaves to make prints instead.",
        "Paint the back with watercolor, press them against paper, then peel them away.",
        "Decoupage the leaves onto glass votives or vases.",
        "Wipe the glass object with rubbing alcohol first.",
        "Paint it with glossy decoupage glue (ie: Mod Podge).",
        "Apply a thin layer of decoupage glue onto the back of the leaf, then paint it onto the glass object.",
        "Coat the leaf with a final layer of decoupage glue.",
        "String the leaves onto a garland.",
        "Thread the leaves right through the joint where the center stem meets the base stem.",
        "You can even make several garlands, then hang them from vertically to create a backdrop.",
        "The string needs to be thin enough to pass through the leaf skeleton.",
        "More delicate leaves may only be able to handle thick thread or baker's twine.",
        "Sturdier leaves may work well with both thick thread or baker's twine, as well as thick twine, thin yarn, or thin jute cord.",
        "If you want to make the leaves keep their position on the string, tie a small knot in the string to either side of the leaf."
