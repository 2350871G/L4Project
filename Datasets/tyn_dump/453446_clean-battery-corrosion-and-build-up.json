        "If the corrosion is fairly light, the baking soda solution may do most of the work for you, in which case, you won\u2019t need to do much scrubbing.",
        "You can also use a wire brush to clean off the residue.",
        "Use the rest of the solution to wash the cable terminals.",
        "If there\u2019s corrosive buildup on the terminal clamps, pour the remaining baking soda solution over them.",
        "Use your toothbrush or a terminal brush to scrub away any residue that remains.",
        "Focus on the parts of the terminals that make direct contact with the battery posts.",
        "Wipe the posts and terminals dry with a clean rag.",
        "Take a clean shop rag and carefully wipe the battery posts and cable terminals to get rid of any remaining moisture or residue.",
        "If there\u2019s a lot of debris, you can rinse the terminals and posts first with cool water from a hose or spray bottle.",
        "Make sure the terminals and posts are completely dry before you attempt to reconnect your battery.",
        "You\u2019re not likely to get a severe electric shock from handling a wet car battery, but it\u2019s best to use caution.",
        "Apply petroleum jelly to the posts to prevent corrosion.",
        "Before you reconnect the battery terminals, rub a generous amount of petroleum jelly on each post.",
        "This will help prevent corrosion from forming on the posts and terminals again.",
        "You can get petroleum jelly at most drug stores.",
        "Reconnect the battery terminals, positive first.",
        "Put the positive terminal back on the positive post and use a wrench to tighten it in place.",
        "Next, do the same with the negative terminal.",
        "When you\u2019re done, start your ignition to make sure the car will start and run properly.",

        "Cleaning Corrosion on Alkaline Battery Contacts Put on rubber gloves and safety goggles.",
        "While the \u201cacid\u201d in alkaline batteries is not actually acidic, it\u2019s still corrosive.",
        "Protect your skin and eyes by putting on household gloves (such as nitrile or rubber cleaning gloves) and safety glasses or goggles before you start working.",
        "It\u2019s also a good idea to protect your workspace by spreading out some newspapers or a plastic tablecloth.",
        "Dispose of the corroded battery.",
        "Once an alkaline battery starts to leak, it\u2019s not good anymore.",
        "Depending on where you live, you may be able to throw the batteries away in your regular trash, or you may need to take them to a hazardous waste disposal facility.",
        "Call your local sanitation department to find out what to do with the batteries.Tip: To prevent the spread of caustic battery fluid, you may wish to use vinegar or lemon juice to clean any corrosion off the batteries themselves before throwing them away.",
        "If you live in the U.S., you can use the Earth911 Recycling Locator to find facilities near you that will accept alkaline batteries for recycling.",
        "Dip a cotton swab in white vinegar or lemon juice.",
        "Unlike a car battery, alkaline batteries are filled with an alkaline, or basic, fluid.",
        "You\u2019ll need a slightly acidic cleaning agent to neutralize the fluid and clean up the corrosion.",
        "Pour a little white vinegar or baking soda into a glass or plastic bowl, then dip a cotton swab in it.",
        "You can also use a small toothbrush.",
        "Take care not to oversaturate the swab so that you don\u2019t get liquid inside the electrical components of your device.",
        "It should be damp but not dripping wet.",
        "You can always squeeze the swab to remove any excess.",
        "Wipe the battery compartment and contacts with the swab.",
        "Take the cotton swab dipped in vinegar or lemon juice and rub it around inside the battery compartment wherever you see corrosion, especially on the battery contacts.",
        "This will start the process of dissolving and neutralizing the corrosion.",
        "Wipe the contacts dry with a clean paper towel when you\u2019re done.",
        "Make sure to get inside the springs.",
        "Scrape away any remaining residue with a metal tool.",
        "Use a small blade or flathead screwdriver to scrape off any stubborn corrosion that remains after wiping down the battery contacts.",
        "You can also use a fiberglass pen brush.",
        "Do this lightly so you don\u2019t scratch up the contacts too much!",
        "Coat the contacts with silicone grease to prevent tarnishing.",
        "When you\u2019ve scraped away as much of the corrosion as possible, use a cotton swab to apply a light coating of silicone grease to the contacts.",
        "You can also use petroleum jelly.",
