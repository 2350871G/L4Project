    "text": " Crafting a Rabbit Onesie Costume Start with a large cut of pink, white or gray fleece fabric, or a fleece blanket. Make sure it is longer than your height from head to toe and wide enough to wrap completely around yourself with a good amount of extra space. Make your onesie. Measure your fit against a comfy pair of sweats and a hoodie. Fold them lengthwise and cut on your folded fabric, leaving about 1.5 in (4 cm) for seam allowance, then flip them and repeat to cut out the back of your onesie. Sew on your zipper, then cut out and sew on your sleeves. Cut and sew your hood. Fold your sweatshirt in half on an unused, folded section of your fleece. Trace it or pin it in place, then cut around it, leaving about 1.5 in (4 cm) for seam allowance. Sew the two pieces together on the curved edge. Open the hood and pin its bottom portion to the back collar of the onesie. Sew it into place. Make a chest piece. Choose a complementary felt color, such as pink for a white or gray costume, or white for a pink costume. Measure yourself from chest to waist, then cut out an oval of that length. Cut it in half, then use a sewing machine or fabric glue to affix the pieces to either side of your zipper. Add a pair of bunny ears to your hood. Cut out two long ear-shaped pieces of matching felt, then two smaller inner ear pieces out of your complementary color. Glue or sew the inner ears onto the bigger ones. For floppy ears, simply glue or sew your felt pieces directly onto your hood. For ears that stand up, attach pipe cleaners or thin wires to the back of the ears, following the edge of the felt. Glue or sew a strip of felt over the wire or pipe cleaners to hide them, then attach the ears. Make a bunny tail. To add the finishing touch to your bunny onesie, use handful of small white cotton balls, one large cotton ball, or a bunched-up feather boa that matches your chest piece and the insides of your ears. Attach it to the back of your costume using fabric glue and let it dry overnight. For added security, clip it on with a few safety pins once it's dried. Making a Simple Bunny Outfit Use an old white sweatshirt for the main section. Cut off the sleeves. For a fuller, fluffier look, line the inside with the batting from a pillow or old couch cushion, hot gluing it in place at the neck and armholes. To prepare for cold weather, wear a long-sleeve white shirt and leggings underneath the sweatshirt, or leave the sleeves attached and role them at the wrist if needed. Use a boa or cotton balls for a tail. Cut off a section of marabou boa, bunch it up and glue it to the back of the costume for a tail. If you don't have a boa, clump together some cotton balls or glue on a larger pom-pom. Make a chest piece with felt or boa. Glue the rest of your boa onto the front of the costume for a cute, fuzzy look. To add a pop of color, cut a large oval out of pink felt and attach to the front of the costume with glue or a sewing machine. Make a bunny hat out of one sleeve. Turn the cut-off sleeve inside out and glue it closed at one end. Snip this end off of the sleeve and fit it to your head, trimming more if necessary. With the other sleeve, cut out two triangles, about 7 in (2.5 cm) long each. Cut out two smaller, teardrop-shaped pieces of pink felt to glue to the ears. Glue the triangles onto the hat for floppy bunny ears. Make a fake carrot as an accessory. To complete the costume, cut out a carrot-shaped piece of cardboard and cover it with orange construction paper. Add some chopped-up green pipe cleaners to the top for a stem. You could use a real carrot for a shorter party. For example, a real carrot would probably be OK to last through an Easter party, but not a full day of school or a long night of trick-or-treating. Assembling a Flirty Bunny Costume Use a black, pink or white leotard or dress. If you don't want to craft the main section of your costume, simply re-purpose another article of clothing. Use a leotard or one-piece swimsuit, a tight or A-line dress, or even a regular shirt and a tutu or full skirt. Make a dress or leotard out of a large T-shirt. Lay a black, white or pink T-shirt flat and place a fitted dress on top of the shirt. Cut around the shirt around the outline of the dress, leaving about 0.5 in (1.2 cm) in space along the sides. Turn it inside out and either glue or sew the sides together. Cut out a neckline if you'd like a lower-cut dress. Hold the dress up against your body before cutting a neckline to get an accurate measurement. Remember to cut carefully.

If you don't have a fitted dress to use as a template, try on the T-shirt and pin it into the style and fit you want, then cut. Create a cute bunny ear headband.

You want to make sure they'll stay on as long as you wear them. Make a fluffy tail. Glue a white, pink or black pom-pom to the back of your dress or leotard with hot glue, using safety pins to attach it more securely. If you used lace for your ears, bunch up some of the extra, tie it together and fluff it out to create a cute tail that matches your ears. Wear tights in case of cold weather. Pair your dress or leotard with some black or lace tights for a look that's more elegant, warmer, and a bit more conservative. Create cufflinks and a collar for a \"Playboy Bunny\" look. Snip two cuffs and the collar off of an old button-down shirt, trimming off any stray strings, and button them around your neck and wrists. Tie a black bow tie around the collar. Feel free to embellish further with a stripe of black or pink fabric, or leave your collar and cufflinks plain white for a classic look.",
