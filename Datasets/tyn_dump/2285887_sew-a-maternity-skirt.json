Begin measuring from just below your baby bump, and finish measuring wherever you want the skirt to land. Add 2 \u20442 inches (6.4 cm) to your measurement for the hem. This will give you the length of the skirt material, including seam allowances. Cut a rectangle based on your measurements. Woven cotton or knit jersey (T-shirt) material are great options for this.

Assembling the Skirt Turn the skirt right-side-out and the waistband inside-out. At this point, you can press the seams on the skirt and the waistband for a nicer finish, but you don\u2019t absolutely have to do this. Slip the waistband over the top edge of the skirt. Make sure that the bottom edge of the waistband (the edge without the elastic) is aligned with the top edge of the skirt. Secure the 2 pieces with sewing pins.

        "The heat settings on irons are usually labeled for the type of fabric they're meant for, like cotton, linen, wool, etc.",
        "If your iron doesn't have fiber labels, use a hot setting for cotton and linen, and a cool or medium setting for wool and synthetics.",
        "Sew along the hem as close as possible to the inside folded edge.",
        "Use a straight stitch for woven material and a zigzag stitch for knit material.",
        "Match the thread color as close as possible to the fabric.",
        "Start and finish sewing at the seam, and remember to backstitch so that your thread doesn't unravel.",
        "Assembling the Skirt Turn the skirt right-side-out and the waistband inside-out.",
        "At this point, you can press the seams on the skirt and the waistband for a nicer finish, but you don\u2019t absolutely have to do this.",
        "Slip the waistband over the top edge of the skirt.",
        "Make sure that the bottom edge of the waistband (the edge without the elastic) is aligned with the top edge of the skirt.",
        "Secure the 2 pieces with sewing pins.",
        "Place the waistband\u2019s side seam in the back of the skirt.",
        "This will give you a nicer finish.",
        "Sew the belly band to the skirt using the shirt\u2019s bottom hem as a guide.",
        "Most T-shirts will have a \u20442 in (1.3 cm) bottom hem.",
        "Since this is the edge that you are sewing to the skirt, you\u2019ll have to ensure that it doesn\u2019t show.",
        "Use the shirt\u2019s bottom hem as a guide for your seam allowance.",
        "Be sure to remove any pins as you sew.",
        "If you used a belly band, then just use a \u20442 in (1.3 cm) seam allowance.",
        "It would be best to use a zigzag stitch for this, but if you can still pull the skirt on and off easily, then you can use a basic straight stitch instead.",
        "Backstitch when you begin and finish sewing so that your stitching doesn't unravel.",
        "Pull the waistband up and press the seam down.",
        "If you want to, use sewing pins to keep the seam down as you press it with an iron.",
        "Remember to take the pins out once you are done, however.",
        "For an even nicer finish, you could topstitch the seam down.",
        "Topstitch the seam using a straight stitch and a matching thread color.",
        "Sew about \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) away from the seam."
