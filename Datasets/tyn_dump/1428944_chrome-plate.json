        "If the object that you\u2019re working with is greasy or oily, skip this step.Tip: If there are any contaminants on the item that you\u2019re plating, your finished product won\u2019t come out as intended and you may have water stains, bubbles, or impurities in your chrome finish.",
        "Put on a pair of rubber gloves and wear protective eyewear.",
        "Most commercial degreasers are skin and eye irritants.",

        "Then, take a clean cloth and scrub the degreaser into the item and remove any oily substances.",
        "Pick up a degreaser at your local cleaning supply or home goods store.",
        "If you want to create your own degreaser, mix 3 tablespoons (43 g) of baking soda with 1 cup (240 mL) of warm water.",

        "Don\u2019t use a scouring pad on plastics that you\u2019re planning on spray painting.",
        "Simply rinse the item under water and wipe them dry.",
        "Painting Items Chrome Purchase a chrome spray paint from a home supply or auto parts store.",
        "Go to a home supply, construction, or auto parts store.",
        "Look for a can of spray paint that is labeled \u201cchrome\u201d or \u201cchrome plating.\u201d Check the label carefully to see if it contains VMP (vacuum metalized pigments), which are chrome-plated paint pigments.",
        "Avoid cans of paint that simply say \u201csilver\u201d or \u201cgold\u201d to get an authentic color that actually replicates the color of chrome plating.Tip: Paints with VMP contain pigments that have been vacuum-plated, meaning that the paint pigment itself has been chrome plated.",
        "These paints are more expensive, but they\u2019re worth it if you want a finish that actually approximates real chrome plating.",
        "These spray paints are often marketed as \u201cmetallic\u201d spray paint.",
        "This is the best option if you have an inexpensive object, like a cheap necklace or vase, that you want to turn chrome for decorative purposes.",
        "Spray painting something chrome isn\u2019t technically chrome plating.",
        "However, spray painting is the easiest method to get a chrome finish, and it\u2019s safer than the other methods.",
        "Take your item outside and lay a drop cloth underneath it.",
        "Aerosol paint can become a lung irritant if you aren\u2019t working in a well-ventilated area.",

        "Move the can back and forth along the top of your item, working down towards the bottom as you spray.",
        "Avoid holding the can in one location for too long to prevent drips from forming on the surface of your item.",
        "Spray painting can feel kind of odd if you\u2019ve never done it before.",
        "If this is your first time using spray paint, try practicing on an item you don\u2019t care about first, like a cardboard box or empty milk carton.",
        "Wait 2-3 hours for the item to dry and flip it over.",
        "Once you\u2019ve covered one side of your item, wait 2-3 hours for the paint to dry completely.",
        "Once the item has air dried, flip it over to expose any unpainted areas that you haven\u2019t covered yet.",
        "Normally, spray paint can dry in 15-30 minutes.",
        "VMP spray paint tends to take a little longer to dry.",
        "Waiting a few hours is a good way to play it safe and ensure that the paint is completely absorbed by the metal or plastic.",
        "Paint the remaining sections of your item and let it air dry.",
        "Paint the unpainted sections of your metal or plastic item using the same process you used on the first side.",
        "Hold the can roughly 8\u201316 in (20\u201341 cm) away from the item and use a smooth back-and-forth stroke to completely cover the object.",

        "If you\u2019d like a brighter finish or a more evenly-textured look, feel free to apply additional layers of paint using the same process you used to paint the object the first time.",
        "Apply an additional 2-4 coats of paint to brighten the color and improve the finish.",
        "Using a Spray Plating Kit Buy a chrome plating spray kit from a chrome plating supply company.",

        "Spray kits will not only give your items a beautiful shine, but they\u2019ll protect metals from rust and erosion!",
        "Unless you have a ton of objects that you\u2019re trying to chrome plate, it\u2019s usually cheaper to simply take your item to a shop that offers chrome plating services.",

        "Take your materials outside to avoid exposure to any of the chrome plating chemicals.",
        "If you\u2019re only plating one side of an item, put a thick drop cloth down underneath your item to ensure that you\u2019re only spraying your object.",
        "You can also set the object up on a stand or stable work surface if you want to spray your entire item at once.",
        "Do not do this on a windy day when the chemicals are going to be blown all over the place.",
        "Cover the object in your activating solution spray.",

        "Pull the trigger on your bottle to cover your object in the activating solution.",
        "Spray 10-20 times across every section of the surface to completely cover it in the activating solution.",
        "Your item must be dripping with the activating solution by the time you\u2019re done.",
        "The activator coats the object in a solution that will bind your chrome spray to the material of the item.",
        "Some kits will refer to the activator as a primer.",
        "Every spray kit is different.",
        "If your instructions tell you to do something before applying an activator, or don\u2019t mention an activator at all, go ahead and skip this step.",
        "Mix your chroming solution with deionized water.",
        "Read your specific kit\u2019s instructions to determine how your chrome spray solution should be mixed.",
        "Most kits provide the deionized water, so you simply have to combine 2-3 bottles into a single spray bottle and shake it up.",
        "Some kits will only require a deionized water rinse before the chroming solution is applied.",
        "If you need to make deionized water yourself, run tap or spring water through a DI system.",

        "If you use a wider nozzle setting, the thinner application may result in an uneven coat.",
        "You should see your item changing color almost immediately as the activator, water, and chrome spray bind to the object\u2019s surface.",
        "Depending on your specific kit, you may have to apply multiple coats of different-density chrome solutions to complete the process.",
        "Apply your sealant by spraying it on.",
        "Either apply your sealant immediately or wait for your chroming solution to dry based on your specific kit\u2019s instructions.",
        "Spray your sealant all over the item that you\u2019re spraying.",
        "Use the same method that you used for the chroming solution, spraying the object by holding the bottle 6\u201310 inches (15\u201325 cm) away from the surface.",
        "Spray it with the sealant until you\u2019ve covered the entire item on every side.",
