Wrap the cake in plastic wrap and place it in a corrugated cardboard box. Tape the box shut to keep out moisture. While you can store the cake in a cake carrier instead of a box, moisture could get into the cake. Moisture will cause condensation to form on the fondant and the colors could run. If the cake is filled with pastry cream, whipped cream, pudding, mousse, or fresh fruit, you'll need to refrigerate the cake."
