        "These are not mandatory to the cosplay, but they will make it more authentic and detailed.",
        "You will need to buy Itachi's red/scarlet Shu ring online from a cosplay supply shop.",
        "You can buy his necklace on there as well, or you can make it yourself by tying pieces of black cording to three silver washers.",
        "The washes need to be spaced a few inches apart.",
        "Doing Your Hair and Makeup Start with primer, foundation, and concealer.",

        "Any shade of brown (a warm, reddish brown or a cool, ashy brown) will do just fine.",

        "If you want to, you can add a neutral shade that matches your skin tone on the lid, and a lighter shade on the brow bone.",
        "Don\u2019t get too carried away, however; you want to keep this part of your makeup subtle.",
        "Add black eyeliner to both your upper and lower lids.",

        "Remember to set your makeup with setting powder or setting spray.",
        "Even if it is a cool day or the convention hall is air conditioned, you will still sweat.",
        "This can cause your makeup to look shiny or wear off.",
        "A good dusting of setting powder or a light misting of setting spray will help prevent this from happening.",

        "A lot of anime characters have exaggerated personalities.",
        "That\u2019s what makes them so fun on screen.",
