Cool water will help seal the cuticle (outer layer) of your hair strands, making your hair sleeker and healthier. To keep it shiny and healthy, wash your hair in the coldest water you can stand. It is especially important to use cool water when rinsing out your conditioner. This will help lock in the moisture from the conditioner."

While tangles and styling are a concern, be careful not to brush and comb too often. Using appropriate methods and tools will keep your hair strong. Brush hair only when it is needed, either to combat tangles or for styling purposes. Over-brushing and vigorous brushing can damage or pull out hair. Do not brush it when it is wet, either.

Combs are for wet hair and removing knots, as well as parting hair and distributing styling products. Brushes are for distributing hair\u2019s natural oils, styling and using with a blow dryer. For example, using a comb to remove tangles allows you to more carefully tease the knot apart without breaking the hair. Brushes do not allow for this kind of finesse."

If you do not have the proper nutrients, your body cannot build hair as quickly or as strongly. Eat a proper diet with the correct nutrients to promote hair growth. Protein: Hair is made mainly of proteins, so your body cannot build good strong hair if it does not have enough. Make sure you are getting complete proteins, either by eating meat, soy products, or multiple alternative sources of protein. Beans, seeds, nuts, milk, and seaweed are good alternative sources of protein but must be eaten in combination to produce a complete protein. Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Your body needs these to produce hair. Hair is made up of 3% fatty acids such as these. However, your body can\u2019t produce these on its own, so you need to be sure that your diet includes these. Fish (such as salmon) and nuts (such as walnuts) are an excellent source of these healthy fats, as well as protein. Zinc: Without zinc, your scalp will become dry and itchy. This can lead to poor hair growth or even hair loss. Get more zinc in your diet by consuming fortified cereals and grains, oysters, and eggs. Vitamin A or beta carotene: Consuming beta carotene allows your body to produce vitamin A. Vitamin A serves many functions in your body but also helps to regulate the oils on your scalp. Without these oils your skin will become dry and your hair will become damaged. Increase beta carotene in your diet by eating lots of sweet potatoes, pumpkin, apricots and carrots. Iron: Iron is necessary for helping oxygenate the blood. This oxygen is necessary for healthy hair. Low iron is a major cause of hair loss, especially in women. Get more iron in your diet by eating dark greens, eggs, and meat. Vitamin B: The entire vitamin B class will help promote healthy hair. Vitamin B5 is necessary to process the fatty acids mentioned above and B7 and B12 are used to process proteins. B9 affects cell growth directly. Get more B vitamins in your diet by consuming turkey, tuna, and lentils. Vitamin E: Vitamin E is absolutely essential to healthy skin and healthy skin means a healthy scalp. It also helps to protect hair. Get more vitamin E by eating sunflower seeds, nuts, and avocados."

Eggs are some sticky business, so wash your hair as normal -- but wash it well. Make darn sure that all the sticky goodness is out, since you don't want to smell like a jar of mayonnaise later on in the day. Shampoo and condition as usual, if you'd like. The drier your hair is normally, the less likely it is that your hair will need shampooing. You know your hair -- will the mask make it at all greasy? If you're prone to quick oil build-up, use shampoo. If not, you can skip it. Style as usual. You can use a deep-treatment mask like this up to once a week, if you'd like. You'll see a difference in no time!",

        "Brushes do not allow for this kind of finesse.",
        "Use the right kind of brush.",
        "Don\u2019t use plastic brushes, as these can be harsh on your scalp and create split ends.",

        "Avoid tight hairstyles like ponytails and buns or too-tight braids and extensions, as these pull hair and hinder growth.",
        "The strain on hair from tight styles such as these can leader hair to weaken and break.",
        "It also puts strain on the scalp itself by inhibiting blood flow.",
        "This can lead to headaches and keeps hair from getting necessary nutrients.",
        "The places on your scalp which see the most strain could even see hair loss (traction alopecia).",
        "Use looser styles if possible and try to avoid hair ties with metal pieces, as these can catch on and pull out hair.",

        "It may seem counter-intuitive, but trimming your hair can actually promote hair growth.",

        "If hair is trimmed regularly, this will significantly reduce split ends, leading to stronger and better-looking hair.",
        "Hair should be trimmed by half to one inch every six to eight weeks.",
        "Even if trimming means you have to sacrifice more length than you\u2019d like, keep in mind that it\u2019s better to have shorter, healthier hair than long, unhealthy hair.",

        "Petrissage relaxes and stretches the muscles, and also improves circulation to the scalp.",
        "Eat healthy.",
        "Eating healthy will have a huge impact on hair growth.",

        "Eat a proper diet with the correct nutrients to promote hair growth.",

        "Beans, seeds, nuts, milk, and seaweed are good alternative sources of protein but must be eaten in combination to produce a complete protein.",
        "Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Your body needs these to produce hair.",
        "Hair is made up of 3% fatty acids such as these.",
        "However, your body can\u2019t produce these on its own, so you need to be sure that your diet includes these.",

        "Get more zinc in your diet by consuming fortified cereals and grains, oysters, and eggs.",
        "Vitamin A or beta carotene: Consuming beta carotene allows your body to produce vitamin A. Vitamin A serves many functions in your body but also helps to regulate the oils on your scalp.",

        "Take vitamin supplements.",
        "Taking vitamins will help ensure that your body has the nutrients it needs to produce healthy hair.",
        "While eating a well-balanced, healthy diet should allow you to have the proper nutrients, vitamin supplements can help you ensure that you are getting the proper amount of each vitamin.",
        "Prenatal vitamin supplements are probably best suited to promoting hair growth, as these contain the vitamins most commonly associated with healthy hair.",

        "Consult your doctor before starting any dietary supplement.",
        "Give your hair an antioxidant mask.",
        "Applying a couple tablespoons of olive oil and coconut oil every couple weeks will flush your hair with antioxidants to fend off decay from free radicals.",

        "Eight glasses of water per day is the typical recommended amount for an adult.",
        "Get plenty of sleep.",
        "Regular sleep cycles help your body regulate melatonin and cortisol levels, both of which affect hair growth.",
        "Also, sleep is necessary to maintaining your body in general.",
        "When your body doesn't get enough sleep, it begins to shut down side processes like hair production.",
        "Each person is different in how much sleep they need, so be sure to get the right amount for your body.",

        "And if you don't like the smell of mustard, replace it!",
        "Olive oil is great for hair strength and shine.",
        "Milk and coconut oil will make it soft and luxurious.",
        "Honey will add a glow and apple cider vinegar will bring it back to life.",
