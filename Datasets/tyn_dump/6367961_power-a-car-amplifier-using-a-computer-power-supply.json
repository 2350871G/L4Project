        "Push the exposed wire underneath the screw, and use a screwdriver to tighten it down.",
        "Make sure the wire doesn\u2019t slip or pull out if you likely tug on it.Cut the COM wires from 2 other 4-pin peripherals and secure them in the ground port if you plan on using the amplifier for more than 30 minutes at a time.",
        "Connect the 12 V+ and remote ports on the amp with the 2 in (5.1 cm) wire.",
        "The remote port on the amplifier allows it to turn on when you start your vehicle, but the remote port needs a 12 V wire attached to it if you use a computer power supply.",
        "Use the second 2 in (5.1 cm) piece of 18-gauge wire you cut earlier to connect to the remote port.",
        "Slide one end of the wire under the screw on the 12 V port and retighten it with your screwdriver.",
        "Feed the other end of the wire underneath the screw labeled \u201cREMOTE\u201d and secure it in place.The amplifier will not start if you don\u2019t connect power to the remote port.",
        "You can also use another COM wire if you want, but you will need to cut it off of another peripheral connector.",
        "Attach speakers to the amplifier with speaker wire.",
        "You can use any type of speaker with your car amplifier.",
        "Plug 1 end of the speaker wire into one of the speaker ports along the back of the amplifier, which are usually labeled \u201cSpeaker Output.\u201d Tighten the screw holding the wire in place so it doesn\u2019t pull out.",
        "Run the other end of the wire to your speaker\u2019s input port, which will either be a clip or screw on the back.",
        "Slide the end of the wire under the screw or into the clip, and tighten it so it\u2019s secure.You can attach multiple speakers to the amplifier, but the power supply may not provide enough electricity for them to work to their full potential.",
        "Plug in the power supply to run the amplifier.",
        "Reconnect the power supply to your wall outlet and turn on the power switch.",
        "Check the amplifier to see if the power light turns on so you know it\u2019s working properly.",
        "Try playing music through the speakers with your phone or another audio device to see how well it works.",
        "When you\u2019re finished, turn off the power supply.If the amplifier doesn\u2019t turn on, check your wire connections to make sure they\u2019re plugged in properly.",
        "If it still doesn\u2019t work, then the amp or power supply may be faulty."
