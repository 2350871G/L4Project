A star ornament requires only the knowledge of three folds and a spool of gift ribbon. Macrame Jewelry would require only a spool of jute and a bag of beads. Origami requires only paper and instructions. (folds flat! Great for stuffing down the side of your purse for a boredom emergency!) Dollar bill origami uses the cash in your pocket instead of origami paper, and is a great way to leave a creative tip and kill time while waiting for the check in a restaurant. All you need is small bills and instructions. A spool of quarter-inch ribbon is all that is needed for a Ribbon Bookmark. Two or three skeins of embroidery floss will make any number of friendship bracelets. Pocket-sized embroidery kits are available to make tiny ornaments. A crochet hook and a small ball of string or yarn is enough for a granny square, motif, or other small project or part of a larger project. Use your imagination. there are lots of fun things to do that take up less than a quart bag in volume."
