Bend the end of the two strands inside the cork into a hook shape. The hook of each strand should curve the same way.

Use a pair of good wire cutters for this. Twist the five iron wire lengths together with your fingers. You want a long braid of wire. It needs to be tightly wound as well. You can make an actual 5-strand braid, or you can just gather the ends together, then twist them like a rope. Place the twisted iron wires onto the copper hooks, making sure it touches both copper strands. For an even better fit, you can tighten the hooks around your iron filament.
