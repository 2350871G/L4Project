Ideas for scenery can include countryside, farmland, mountain areas, villages, and even a cityscape. Consider the season or climate as well as the landscape. This provides you with an opportunity to develop scenery around specific themes, such as a snowy winter, a colorful fall, a bright summer or even a tropical setting. Look up famous train lines on Wikipedia or train hobbyist sites, for inspiration. Obtain your supplies from a hobby store. Good supplies include grass, trees, buildings, people etc. You will also need a shaker to put the grass into the scenery. If you don't know what to products to buy, ask for help. Also gather items from around the home that can be repurposed as model train scenery.

A wooden board is recommended, as it is strong and not likely to bend. Cardboard would need to be thick or layered and is not likely to be as effective as wood. Creating the basic scenery Use glue or scenic cement to glue down the larger scenery elements to your layout. Hobby brands such as Woodland Scenics have a great range of scenic cement but if you want a cheaper option, make your own using PVA glue, detergent, a glass jar and an eye dropper. Mix half glue half water and two drops of detergent in the jar then shake the mix. Put down some glue solution or scenic cement. Put the grass material in a shaker and gently shake on the chosen area. Open a jar, get an eye dropper and some glue solution or scenic cement. Gently drop over area. Continue adding other scenic elements.  Wait until dry. If the scenery did not turn out the way you wanted, put another layer on and repeat until you are happy.",
