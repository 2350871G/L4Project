Repairing PVC Piping Purchase a PVC slide repair coupling for your broken pipe. PVC slide repair couplings are made from 2 parts: the slip fix, which is the extendable portion, and the smaller slip coupling. After attaching the slip coupling to one end of the broken pipe, you can pull the extendable slip fix toward the other end and attach it. This makes pipe repair easier and reduces the need for exact measurements. Buy a PVC slide repair coupling from a home improvement store. Always purchase products that are designed for the same size as your piping. For example, if your PVC piping is 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter, make sure you purchase a slide repair coupling for 4 inch (10 cm) diameter pipes. Attach the slip coupling to the piston end of the slip fix. The piston end of the slip fix is the smaller region that extends from the larger region. Slide the coupling over the piston end and press it against the slip fix with considerable pressure. Be sure the slip coupling is flush with the piston end of the slip fix. Place the compressed slip fix against the piping to determine where to cut. Hold the slip fix and coupling against the region of your piping that needs to be repaired. Mark off the point of the piping that aligns with each side of the compressed slip fix using a permanent marker. Be sure the slip coupling is attached firmly to the slip fix before taking your measurements. Remove the damaged section of the piping with PVC pipe cutters.

Continue doing this until you make a clean cut through the PVC piping. Now, repeat this process for the other cut line. Make sure the cuts are as straight as possible. Apply primer to the slip coupling and piston end of the slip fix. PVC primer softens the material and prepares it for solvent cement. Remove the slip coupling from the piston end of the slip fix. Now, use the brush applicator to apply primer to the inside 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the slip coupling as well as the top inner 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the piston end of the slip fix. Purchase PVC primer from home hardware stores. Apply solvent cement over the primer on the slip coupling and slip fix. Solvent cement is designed to bind PVC pipe fittings. Use the brush applicator to apply solvent cement to the same regions of the slip coupling and piston end of the slip fix that you applied PVC primer. Purchase solvent cement from home hardware stores. Push each slip piece together until they are flush against each other. Push the slip coupling over the piston end of the slip fix and press it in using a considerable amount of force. Once the two pieces are flush, turn the slip coupling \u00bc of the way around the piston end of the slip fix. Now, hold the pieces together in this position for 4 to 5 seconds. Wipe off excess solvent cement with a rag when you're finished. Apply PVC primer and solvent cement to the coupling and one repair pipe. Use your brush applicators to apply another 1 inch (2.5 cm) of PVC primer followed by  1 inch (2.5 cm) of solvent cement to the inner exposed end of the slip coupling. Afterward, do the same to the inner end of one of the pipes that you are repairing. Be sure the slip coupling and slip fix are firmly held together before this step. Install the coupling over the repair pipe covered with solvent cement. Press the exposed end of the slip coupling over the exposed repair pipe until it can't go any farther. Afterward, give it a 1/4 turn around the piping and hold it in place for 3 to 4 seconds. Again, wipe off excess solvent cement with a cloth when you're finished. Repeat the previous process for the remaining repair piping. Again, apply another 1 inch (2.5 cm) of PVC primer followed by 1 inch (2.5 cm) of solvent cement to the inner region of the remaining end of the slip fix, which is the piston end. Now, apply the same amounts of product to the inner end of the remaining exposed pipe you are repairing. Always apply PVC primer before you apply solvent cement. Connect the piston end of the slip fix to the remaining piping. Pull the piston end of the slip fix toward the remaining piping, turning it clockwise as you do so. Continue pulling the piston and turning it so that it extends over the piping until it cannot extend any farther. Let the solvent cement dry according to the manufacturer's instructions. Turn the main water supply back on and flush your water lines. After the solvent cement dries, turn your main water supply back on and be sure that your piping doesn't leak.

        "Repeat the cutting process over the second cut mark.",
        "Always make sure the head of the cutters faces the ceiling when starting the initial cut.",
        "Pipe cutters are handheld tools for cutting copper piping and can be purchased from a home improvement store.",
        "Cut a repair sleeve 1 inch (2.5 cm) longer than the damaged pipe.",
        "A repair sleeve is the new piping\u2014cut from the longer repair coupling\u2014that connects the two exposed pieces of piping.",
        "To determine the length of the sleeve, measure the length of the damaged piece of piping and add 1 inch (2.5 cm).",
        "Now, mark this amount on a repair coupling from one of its ends using a permanent marker.",
        "Using your pipe cutter, grip the marked section firmly and turn the screw while rotating the cutter clockwise.",
        "Always start cutting with the pipe cutter head facing upward to the ceiling.",
        "Clean the repair sleeve before inserting it.",
        "Start by inserting the pipe cutter blade into the cut region of the repair sleeve.",
        "Turn the cutter around the perimeter to scrape off uneven regions of the piping until it can smoothly fit over the older piping.",
        "Afterward, insert a wire fitting brush into the repair sleeve and scrub out any corrosion.",
        "Finally, wipe off the outer surface of the piping with emery paper or a plumber's sand cloth.",
        "Just to be safe, always clean the repair sleeve before inserting it\u2014even if it already fits evenly over the older piping.",
        "Slide the repair sleeve between the two older pipes.",
        "You should now have two exposed pipes with a gap where the damage used to be.",
        "Start by sliding one end of the repair sleeve onto one of these pipes.",
        "Afterward, slide the remaining hole of the repair sleeve over the remaining piping.",
        "If you're having trouble fitting the repair sleeve, loosen any close-by pipe hangers\u2014the circular clamps that line most pipes\u2014with a screwdriver.",
        "Just be sure to tighten them once the repair sleeve is attached.",
        "Make sure approximately \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) of each pipe inserts into the repair sleeve.",
        "Open the faucet above the leaking pipe if there is one.",
        "Before you start soldering, turn on a faucet located on an upper level above the leak.",
        "At this point, the main water supply should be completely off, so nothing should come out\u2014it will just keep pressure from increasing and pushing water into the damaged piping as you repair.",
        "If there is no faucet directly above your piping, skip this step.",
        "Before you move to the next step, make sure you have a gas torch and solder.",
        "You can purchase both from a home improvement store.",
        "Solder the joint using a gas torch and solder.",
        "Start by opening the fuel adjustment valve of the torch and lighting the tip by hitting the ignitor button.",
        "Adjust the flame until the blue cone is about 1.25 inches (3.2 cm) long.",
        "Now, hold the flame so that the tip barely touches the fitting.",
        "Hold the tip of the solder at the opposite side of the joint and wait until the solder wire liquefies and travels into the joint.",
        "Once the solder melts enough to fill the entirety of the joint, remove the flame.",
        "Cover wooden ceiling joists with a flame protector cloth.",
        "Afterward, place a steel place cover any nearby flammable materials.",
        "Give the solder 30 to 45 seconds to cool before turning on the main water supply.",
        "Turn on the main water supply and flush your lines.",
        "After letting the solder set, turn the main water supply back on and check if there are any leaks.",
        "If there are, check your piping and look for any regions that the solder did not flow into.",
        "Re-solder these regions until no water flows from the main water supply.",
        "Once the pipes are repaired, let your water lines run for about 5 to 10 minutes to flush out any debris.",
        "Be sure to turn your water supply off and drain affected piping before re-soldering.",
        "Repairing PVC Piping Purchase a PVC slide repair coupling for your broken pipe.",
        "PVC slide repair couplings are made from 2 parts: the slip fix, which is the extendable portion, and the smaller slip coupling.",
        "After attaching the slip coupling to one end of the broken pipe, you can pull the extendable slip fix toward the other end and attach it.",
        "This makes pipe repair easier and reduces the need for exact measurements.",
        "Buy a PVC slide repair coupling from a home improvement store.",
        "Always purchase products that are designed for the same size as your piping.",
        "For example, if your PVC piping is 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter, make sure you purchase a slide repair coupling for 4 inch (10 cm) diameter pipes.",
        "Attach the slip coupling to the piston end of the slip fix.",
        "The piston end of the slip fix is the smaller region that extends from the larger region.",
        "Slide the coupling over the piston end and press it against the slip fix with considerable pressure.",
        "Be sure the slip coupling is flush with the piston end of the slip fix.",
        "Place the compressed slip fix against the piping to determine where to cut.",
        "Hold the slip fix and coupling against the region of your piping that needs to be repaired.",
        "Mark off the point of the piping that aligns with each side of the compressed slip fix using a permanent marker.",
        "Be sure the slip coupling is attached firmly to the slip fix before taking your measurements.",
        "Remove the damaged section of the piping with PVC pipe cutters.",
        "Align your PVC pipe cutter jaws around the first mark and grip the handles.",
        "Squeeze the handles of the cutters tightly while moving the cutters in an up and down motion.",
        "Continue doing this until you make a clean cut through the PVC piping.",
        "Now, repeat this process for the other cut line.",
        "Make sure the cuts are as straight as possible.",
        "Apply primer to the slip coupling and piston end of the slip fix.",
        "PVC primer softens the material and prepares it for solvent cement.",
        "Remove the slip coupling from the piston end of the slip fix.",
        "Now, use the brush applicator to apply primer to the inside 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the slip coupling as well as the top inner 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the piston end of the slip fix.",
        "Purchase PVC primer from home hardware stores.",
        "Apply solvent cement over the primer on the slip coupling and slip fix.",
        "Solvent cement is designed to bind PVC pipe fittings.",
        "Use the brush applicator to apply solvent cement to the same regions of the slip coupling and piston end of the slip fix that you applied PVC primer.",
        "Purchase solvent cement from home hardware stores.",
        "Push each slip piece together until they are flush against each other.",
        "Push the slip coupling over the piston end of the slip fix and press it in using a considerable amount of force.",
        "Once the two pieces are flush, turn the slip coupling \u00bc of the way around the piston end of the slip fix.",
        "Now, hold the pieces together in this position for 4 to 5 seconds.",
        "Wipe off excess solvent cement with a rag when you're finished.",
        "Apply PVC primer and solvent cement to the coupling and one repair pipe.",
        "Use your brush applicators to apply another 1 inch (2.5 cm) of PVC primer followed by  1 inch (2.5 cm) of solvent cement to the inner exposed end of the slip coupling.",
        "Afterward, do the same to the inner end of one of the pipes that you are repairing.",
        "Be sure the slip coupling and slip fix are firmly held together before this step.",
        "Install the coupling over the repair pipe covered with solvent cement.",
        "Press the exposed end of the slip coupling over the exposed repair pipe until it can't go any farther.",
        "Afterward, give it a 1/4 turn around the piping and hold it in place for 3 to 4 seconds.",
        "Again, wipe off excess solvent cement with a cloth when you're finished.",
        "Repeat the previous process for the remaining repair piping.",
        "Again, apply another 1 inch (2.5 cm) of PVC primer followed by 1 inch (2.5 cm) of solvent cement to the inner region of the remaining end of the slip fix, which is the piston end.",
        "Now, apply the same amounts of product to the inner end of the remaining exposed pipe you are repairing.",
        "Always apply PVC primer before you apply solvent cement.",
        "Connect the piston end of the slip fix to the remaining piping.",
        "Pull the piston end of the slip fix toward the remaining piping, turning it clockwise as you do so.",
        "Continue pulling the piston and turning it so that it extends over the piping until it cannot extend any farther.",
        "Let the solvent cement dry according to the manufacturer's instructions.",
        "Turn the main water supply back on and flush your water lines.",
        "After the solvent cement dries, turn your main water supply back on and be sure that your piping doesn't leak.",
        "Once the piping is fixed, turn on the water lines for 5 to 10 minutes to flush out any debris that made its way into the system.",
        "If your piping still leaks, double-check that your slip fix and slip coupling are flush against each other and not loosely connected"
