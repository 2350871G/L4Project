Making Crayon Floam Gather your materials. You will need two crayons, vegetable oil, water, flour, polystyrene beads, a knife, a pan, and a stovetop or hot plate.

It's also a good idea to keep your floam in an airtight container or zipper bag to prevent it from drying out. Making Floam without Borax Put about \u00bd cup of white craft glue in a mixing bowl. Measure about \u00bd cup of white craft glue out and place it into a medium-sized bowl. If you want to make several floams in different colors, use separate bowls for each \u00bd cup of glue. Squirt contact solution into the bowl. There\u2019s no exact amount for this, just squeeze the bottle into the bowl for about 2 seconds. Use a spoon to stir the glue and contact solution together. Add food coloring. Use any color you want! Start off with 2 or 3 drops, then stir it into the glue mixture. Evaluate the color. If you want your floam to be darker or brighter, add a few more drops of food coloring and stir again until fully incorporated. Add the Styrofoam beads.

Add 1 to 2 additional tablespoons of the beads (depending on the consistency you want) and mix well again. If you need to add more, continue in this way until you\u2019re satisfied with the texture.

Mix well until the baking soda dissolves and is fully incorporated. Pour about 2 teaspoons of the baking soda mixture into the floam. Mix vigorously until fully incorporated.
