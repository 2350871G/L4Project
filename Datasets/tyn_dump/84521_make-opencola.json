Use a spoon to mix the oils and water until they are thoroughly combined. This mixture makes the flavouring for the cola. If you find it difficult to source neroli oil, use petitgrain, bergamot, or bitter orange oil instead. Cassia oil is also called cinnamon oil. If possible, use pure essential oils, as these will have a superior taste. Purchase essential oils from a health store or online."
