The pencil will anchor your pendulum and keep it from falling down, so be sure to use enough tape to secure it and keep it from moving around. Test the pencil by flicking it with your finger.

Tie a knot with the loop to keep it from coming undone. Slide the loop onto the pencil and slide it off to make sure it\u2019s not too tight. Make a small \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) hook with a metal wire. Take a 2 in (5.1 cm) length of metal wire and curl one end of it into a \u201cJ\u201d shape to form your hook.

Tape a piece of paper on a wall or table behind the hook. You can use the paper to mark where you release the pendulum each time so you can see the way the pendulum behaves and swings based on where you release it. Tape the paper so that it is a backdrop behind the hook with the nut on it. Any color paper is fine, as long as you can see the pencil markings. Experimenting with the Pendulum Pull the hook with the nut on it back about 20 inches (51 cm). Before you release it, use your pencil to mark on the paper taped behind the pendulum where you release it from. That way, you can repeat the experiment by letting the pendulum go from the same place each time. You need to have a consistent release point for accurate results in your experiments! Release the pendulum and start a stopwatch. When you release the pendulum, count the number of oscillations, or the number of times it swings back and forth, for 1 minute. Repeat the process 5 times, releasing the pendulum from the same spot on the paper each time. Let the pendulum fall on its own; don\u2019t swing or push it. Write down the number of oscillations so you can calculate an average. Calculate the average of the oscillations. Take the number of oscillations from each time you released the pendulum, add them all together, then divide the number by 5.
