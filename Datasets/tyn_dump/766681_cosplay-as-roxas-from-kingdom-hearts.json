The zipper piece is a complex shape that resembles four arrows or even a shuriken. Look for a sweatshirt with a gray ribbed cuff at the bottom by the waist. The second part is a white short sleeved sweatshirt with a zipper, and various black patterns on it. The sleeves have a black cuff. Near the chest are blocky patterns that match front-to-back.
