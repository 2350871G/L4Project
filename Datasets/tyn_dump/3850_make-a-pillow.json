        "Lois Wade\t\t\twikiHow Crafts Expert\t\t\t\tWhat stuffing works well for homemade pillows?",
        "DIY guru, Lois Wade, tells us: \"You can use pretty much anything that's soft and can withstand being put through a washing machine.",
        "I wouldn't recommend paper, but you could use fabric scraps, cotton wool, polyester wool, woolen wool, Kapok, thistledown, mill end thread, or whatever else you have on hand.",
        "I\u2019ve had some very useable couch pillows stuffed with plastic shopping bags that had been cut into squares.\"",
        "Pin and sew the opening shut.",
        "You can do this by hand with a ladder stitch or a blind stitch, or you can topstitch it on the sewing machine instead.",
        "Remove the pins when you are done.",
        "Keep the stitching tight and small hen hand sewing.",
        "Knot the thread securely at the end.",
        "Use a \u215b-inch (0.32-centimeter) seam allowance and a matching thread color when machine sewing.",
        "Remember to backstitch at the start and end of your sewing.",
        "Sewing an Envelope Pillowcase Pick your fabric.",
        "You can use jut about any type of fabric you want to make a pillowcase.",
        "Some types of fabric work better than others depending on what you ill be using the pillow for, however.",
        "For example, a soft cotton with a high thread count will work best for a sleeping pillow.",
        "Brocade and home decor fabric would work better for decorative throw pillows.",
        "Cut a piece of fabric that is the same size as your pillow form.",
        "Measure the pillow insert first, then cut a piece of fabric according to that measurement.",
        "This will make the front of your pillow.",
        "You will be making the pillowcase a little smaller than the pillow form itself.",
        "This will give you a nice, full pillow.",
        "Cut two smaller pieces of fabric for the back of the pillow.",
        "Each piece needs to be the same width as the pillow, but only half the height, plus an additional 5 inches (12.7 centimeters).",
        "This will create an overlap while accounting for hems and seam allowances.",
        "Alternatively, you can make the pieces the same width and two-thirds of the height.",
        "The back piece can be the same color and pattern as your front piece, or they can be different.",
        "Hem one of the long edges on each of the back pieces.",
        "Turn one of the back pieces so that the wrong side is facing you.",
        "Fold the long, top edge down twice by \u00bd-inch (1.27 centimeters).",
        "Press it flat once more, then topstitch it as close as possible to the inside folded edge.",
        "Repeat this step for the other back piece.",
        "Pin the back pieces to the front piece, hemmed edges overlapping.",
        "Set the front piece down first, right-side-up.",
        "Place one of the back pieces on top, right-side-down, then add the second back piece, right-side-down.",
        "Make sure that the raw edges of the back pieces match up with the raw edges of the front piece.",
        "Make sure that the hemmed edge of the back pieces are overlapping along the middle of the front piece.",
        "Sew along all four edges.",
        "Use a \u00bd-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance and a matching thread color.",
        "Backstitch at the start and end of your sewing, and remove the pins as you sew.",
        "Do not leave a gap for turning.",
        "You will be turning the pillow through the opening created by the overlapping back pieces.",
        "Finish the inside of the pillowcase, if needed.",
        "If you used thick or bulky fabric, snip off the corners as close to the stitching as you can.",
        "If your fabric is prone to fraying, serge or zigzag stitch the raw edges.",
        "Turn the pillowcase right-side-out.",
        "Pull apart the to hemmed edges in the middle of the pillow.",
        "Reach into the pillow and grab it by the corners.",
        "Pull the corners through the opening.",
        "Use your fingers to push the corners out further, if needed.",
        "Insert your pillow form.",
        "The back pieces of the pillow will overlap across the back of the pillow form, keeping it inside.",
        "There is no need to add buttons, snaps, or zippers!",
        "Tying a No-Sew Pillow Get some non-fraying fabric, such as fleece or flannel.",
        "You will be cutting two pieces of fabric, one for the front of the pillow, and one for the back.",
        "You can use the same color and pattern for each piece, or you can use coordinating ones.",
        "Make sure that you use the same type of fabric, however!",
        "Cut the fabric into two identical squares or rectangles.",
        "Each piece needs to be 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) wider and 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) longer than you want the final pillow to be.",
        "Your fringe will be 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) long.",
        "If you want a longer fringe, cut the fabric larger.",
        "Cut a 3-inch (7.62-centimeter) square out of each corner.",
        "Lay the two fabric pieces on top of each other, with the wrong sides facing in.",
        "Cut a 3-inch (7.62-centimeter) square out of each corner.",
        "Make sure that you are cutting through both layers of fabric.",
        "If you cut your fabric larger for a longer fringe, cut the squares the same size you want the fringe to be.",
        "Cut a fringe into each of the four edges.",
        "Each tassel needs to be 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) deep and \u00bc to 1 inch (0.64 to 2.54 centimeters) wide.",
        "Again, make sure that you are cutting through both layers of fabric, otherwise the fringes won't match up.",
        "Tie the top tassels to the matching bottom tassels.",
        "Use a tight, double knot or a square knot.",
        "Tie together three of the edges, and only half of the fourth edge.",
        "You won't be turning the pillowcase inside out, but you will be stuffing it!",
        "Add your stuffing.",
        "A polyester stuffing will work the best, but you can use a pillow form as well.",
        "Stuff the pillow until it is nice and full, making sure to fill out the corners.",
        "You can buy polyester stuffing at a fabric store or craft store.",
        "Finish tying the pillow.",
        "Poke the stuffing into the pillow as you tie the last few tassels together.",
        "For extra security, tie the corners together in a double-knot."
