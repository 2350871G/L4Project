    "text": " Slicing and Cooking the Ginger Choose a young, fresh ginger root to make the candied ginger with. Look for a ginger root that is tender and firm. Avoid any ginger roots which feel papery, as this means that they are old. Grease a cooling rack and line a half sheet pan. Use a non-stick cooking spray to lightly coat the cooling rack. Then line the half sheet pan with a sheet of parchment paper. A half sheet pan is 18 by 13 inches (46 cm \u00d7 33 cm). Wash 1 lb (450 g) of fresh ginger and peel it using a spoon. Wash the ginger root first under cool, running water. Then scrape the skin off with the edge of a spoon using strong, downward strokes. You can peel the ginger whole, or you can break lobes off and peel each one individually. Slice the ginger into \u215b in (3.2 mm) thick slices. Use a mandoline to evenly slice the entire ginger root. Place the ginger into the handguard, and push it down the runway to create the slices. Alternatively, if you don\u2019t have a mandoline, use a paring knife to slice the ginger as thinly as possible. Cook the ginger in 5 cups (1.2 L) of water for 35 minutes. Place the ginger slices into a saucepan, and turn the stovetop burner on to medium-high heat. Cover the saucepan as the ginger cooks, and leave the saucepan over the heat until the ginger is tender. A 4-quart saucepan is the best size to use for cooking the ginger in the water. Use a fork to check if the ginger is tender. Drain the ginger and retain \u00bc cup (60 ml) of the liquid. Put a colander into a large bowl, and transfer the ginger pieces into it. Lift the colander up and gently move it around to drain the water from the ginger. Use a measuring cup to reserve some of the liquid. The rest of the cooking liquid can either be discarded or kept to make a ginger infused tea. Candying the Ginger Weigh the cooked ginger and measure out the same weight of sugar. Place the ginger onto a set of kitchen scales, and remember the measurement. Remove the ginger from the scales, and measure out the exact same amount of granulated sugar. This will most likely be approximately 1 lb (450 g) of sugar. Keep the remaining granulated sugar, as you will use this to coat the ginger when it has crystallized. Bring the ginger, cooking liquid, and granulated sugar to a boil. Place the ginger, sugar, and \u00bc cup (60 ml) of the cooking liquid into the saucepan. Adjust the stovetop to a medium-high heat, and stir the ingredients as you bring it to a boil. Use a wooden spoon to stir the ingredients. Cook the ingredients over a medium heat for approximately 20 minutes. Once the ingredients start boiling, reduce the heat down to medium. Let the ginger cook until the sugar syrup has almost evaporated and looks very dry, and then remove it from the heat. Continue stirring the ingredients frequently as they cook. The sugar syrup will be recrystallizing by around 20 minutes. Coat the ginger pieces in the remaining sugar on the half sheet pan. Use a slotted spoon or a serving spoon to take the ginger from the saucepan to the half sheet pan. Use tongs to thoroughly cover the ginger pieces in the extra sugar. A slotted spoon or a serving spoon will help to drain any excess syrup off the ginger pieces before they go onto the half sheet pan.
