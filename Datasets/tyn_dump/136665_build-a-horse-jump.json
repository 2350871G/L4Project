A pair of sawhorses is ideal to do this, but you can also use a hay bale or bag of shavings as well. Regardless, make sure your piece of wood is steady and well-supported. Purchase sawhorses and treated wood pieces from a home hardware store. Buy bags of shavings or hay bales from a farming store, tractor supply, or online supplier. Grip your wood and saw properly before making your cut. Hold the wood with your non-dominant hand and the saw with your dominant hand. Now, grip the saw at the handle with your thumb and 3 fingers. Keep your index finger on the side of the handle and pointing down in the blade's direction. Direct your fingers away from the saw blade. Saw your piece of wood into two 4 foot (1.2 m) pieces. The piece of wood is cut into 2 standards, which stand vertically across from each other and hold the horizontal PVC pipe your horse jumps over. Start drawing the saw blade on the cut line at a 45-degree angle and continue until there is a groove in the wood. Now, start stroking back and forth along the length of the blade. Be sure to slow down and decrease pressure as you reach the end. Use as little pressure as possible\u2014let the saw do the work. Use a fine-toothed saw for a smoother cut. If you use a large-toothed saw, you will be able to cut faster but with less accuracy. Draw a line 18 inches (46 cm) from the bottom of each piece of wood. Lay down both 4 foot (1.2 m) pieces onto a flat surface. Now, use a measuring tape to mark the spot 18 inches (46 cm) from the bottom of each. Mark jump cup holes in the center of each beam from the line to the top. Start by marking a small circle in the center of the line you just drew. Now, measure 3 inches (7.6 cm) from here and mark another one. Continue doing this until you reach the top of the beam. Repeat this process for the second beam. The jump cups hold the beam that your horse will jump over. Drill \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) holes through the beam at each mark. Attach a \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) drill bit to your electric drill. Now, drill holes at each of the circles all the way through the beam. Pull the drill trigger and look for a wobble in your drill bit. If you notice one, readjust it. If the drill motor turns off, rotate the collar below the drill bit\u2014also known as the clutch\u2014to a higher number. The numbers indicate torque, and if the motor turns off it means there's too much resistance and you need more torque. Widen the \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) holes to \u20442 inch (1.3 cm). Switch your electric drill's spade bit to \u20442 inch (1.3 cm). Afterward, drill through each of the \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) holes again with your new bit to widen them. Mounting the Jump's Feet and Pole Measure every 20 in (51 cm) down 2 treated 1 in \u00d7 4 in (2.5 cm \u00d7 10.2 cm) planks. Place the first plank onto your sawhorses or other objects. Now, use a pencil to mark every 20 inches (51 cm) from one end to the other. Repeat the process with the second plank. Make sure your pieces are 8 feet (2.4 m) long. Cut each plank into 4 foot (1.2 m) pieces. Each piece is a \"jump foot\" that will be attached to the 4 in \u00d7 4 in (10 cm \u00d7 10 cm) beam. Use your saw to cut each 1 by 4 inch (2.5 cm \u00d7 10.2 cm) plank into 4 pieces. Take care to cut along the line at a 45-degree angle and cut back and forth using almost the entire length of the blade. Minimize the amount of pressure you apply and let the saw do most of the work. Attach a foot to the base of a 4 foot (1.2 m) 4 by 4 inch (10 cm \u00d7 10 cm) beam. Place one of your 4 in \u00d7 4 in (10 cm \u00d7 10 cm) beams on your sawhorses and place a beam perpendicular to it so it creates a 90-degree angle along the bottom. Now, mount the foot using 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) wood screws. Align the screws at the upper-right and bottom-right of the top of the foot an equal distance about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) from the edge. Continue mounting the other three 4 foot (1.2 m) jump feet in a pinwheel pattern. Rotate the beam after mounting each foot. Be sure to use two 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) wood screws to mount each one. Add the remaining 4 jump feet to the free end of the 4 in \u00d7 4 in (10 cm \u00d7 10 cm) beam. Attach the jump cup pins into each \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) hole. Insert the pins on each jump cup into the holes on the sides of the posts. Be sure that the jump cups are at an equal height\u2014this is where the pole will run horizontally. Connect your 10 foot (3.0 m) 40 PVC pipe between the cups. Attach each end of the pipe into a jump cup. Adjust the standard pieces as needed to ensure the pipe fits and is perfectly aligned. Use a PVC pipe that is 4 inches (10 cm) wide for the best results.",
