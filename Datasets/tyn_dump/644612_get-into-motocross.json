Find a bike that suits your size. Especially if you're a beginner, you need a bike that's short enough to allow you to put both feet on the ground. How old are you? If you're a teenager, you'll want a 85cc-250cc bike. Adults should get 250cc-500cc bikes. Note that cc stands for cubic centimeters. The more cubic centimeters, the more power the bike has. How much time are you willing to put into maintenance? Different bikes require different amounts of care. Generally speaking, two stroke bikes take more maintenance but are easier to maintain as four stroke motors are more complex. How much money are you willing to spend? Motocross is expensive. Bikes generally cost thousands of dollars. Used bikes cost significantly less. Find a bike that fits your budget. Remember that you have more expenses coming with other equipment and memberships."
