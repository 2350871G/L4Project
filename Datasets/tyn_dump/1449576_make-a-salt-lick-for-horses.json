Check that the salt is not a mineral salt blend, such as red salt, or salt that is meant for de-icing roads. If you are introducing your horse to a salt lick, start with plain white salt or iodized table salt. The type of salt that is best for your horse will depend on his nutritional needs and his current diet. If your horse only needs sodium and chloride, table salt is a great option. Some horses may do better with iodized salt or trace mineral salt if they are not getting enough supplements in their diet. If you are giving your horse commercial feed or a vitamin/mineral supplement, he does not need iodized salt as he is already getting enough iodine in his diet. A build up of iodine in your horse can lead to other health issues. Always talk to your vet before you give your horse any homemade products, including a salt lick."
