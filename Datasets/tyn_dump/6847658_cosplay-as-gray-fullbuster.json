If you can\u2019t purchase the props online, it is possible to make them from cardboard, paper mache, and paint. To make the ice sword, cut out a long piece of cardboard with a pointed end. The shape should look like a basic sword. Then, on a separate piece of cardboard or paper draw half of a snowflake and cut it out. Attach it to the sword, about eight inches high onto the cardboard, with glue. Then, paint the sword blue and white. To make the \u201cIce Make\u201d cannon, you will need to start with a cardboard tube. Then, cut an octagon with a circle in the middle out of foam. Make one more octagon and put the two together to create a three dimensional shape. Attach this octagon to the end of the tube. Then, cut two circular shapes out of foam and attach them together to make a three dimensional shape. Attach this piece three-quarters of the way at the end of the tube. This is the basic shape of the cannon. Next, use smaller circular tubes to make the \u201cscrews.\u201d Once the shape is put together, cover the cannon in papier mache, paint it white and blue, and allow it to dry."
