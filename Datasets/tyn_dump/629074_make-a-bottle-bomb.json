Tear a paper towel in half or tear off a square of plastic wrap, approximately 7 inches by 7 inches. Measure out about a tablespoon of baking soda and place it in the center of the paper towel or plastic wrap. Set aside. Pour the vinegar. Pour about an inch to an inch-and-a-half of vinegar into the bottle. Be careful not to fill it too full or the bomb may explode before you\u2019re ready.
