Place 2 cups (400 grams) of fresh, sliced strawberries, \u00bd cup (115 grams) of granulated white sugar, and \u00bd cup (120 milliliters) of water into a saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-low heat, then reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes. Pur\u00e9e the strawberry mixture. Pour the strawberry mixture into a blender or food processor, and pur\u00e9e until smooth, about 10 seconds. From time to time, pause the blender/food processor, and use a rubber spatula to push any lumps or clumps down towards the bottom. The smoother the pur\u00e9e is, the smoother your buttercream will be. Chill the strawberry syrup in the fridge for at least 20 minutes. Pour the syrup into a bowl, and cover it with a sheet of plastic wrap. Put it into the fridge, and leave it there for at least 20 minutes. Set aside 4 tablespoons of the strawberry syrup, and store the rest in the fridge. Keep the leftover strawberry syrup in a jar or bottle with a tight-fitting lid, and use it within one week. You can use it on top of ice cream, waffles, pancakes, and other desserts. Beat the butter and \u00bd cup (65 grams) of the powdered sugar. You can do this using a handheld mixer, a stand mixer, or a food processor fitted with whisks. Be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl. The more sugar you add, the stiffer your buttercream will be. Add 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of the strawberry syrup and beat again. Keep adding the sugar and strawberry syrup a little bit at a time until you have used up all of your sugar. Remember, you are only using 4 tablespoons (60 milliliters) of the strawberry syrup. Add the vanilla extract. Beat it in using a high speed setting for 20 seconds. This will lighten the frosting. Vanilla extract can change the color of frosting slightly. If this bothers you, use the clear, colorless kind. Beat in the half-and-half, 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) at a time. Keep adding the half-and-half until the buttercream holds its shape.

Making Strawberry Cream Cheese Frosting Pur\u00e9e the strawberries and the sugar. Add 1\u00bc cups (250 grams) of fresh, chopped strawberries and 1 tablespoon (15 grams) of granulated white sugar into a blender or food processor. Pur\u00e9e until smooth, about 10 seconds. From time to time, pause the blender/food processor, and scrape any large clumps down towards the bottom with a rubber spatula. Pour the pur\u00e9e through a fine, mesh sieve into a medium-sized saucepan. Discard anything that gets caught in the sieve. You will end up with about \u00bd cup (120 milliliters) of strawberry pur\u00e9e. Cook the strawberry pur\u00e9e for 10 to 15 minutes. Bring the strawberry pur\u00e9e to a boil over medium heat, then reduce the heat to low. Let the pur\u00e9e simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until it thickens. You will end up with about 3 to 4 tablespoons (50 to 60 milliliters) of strawberry pur\u00e9e. Chill the strawberry pur\u00e9e, then set aside 3 tablespoons (45 milliliters) for your frosting. Pour the strawberry pur\u00e9e into a bowl, and let it reach room temperature before chilling it in the fridge for at least 20 minutes. Once the pur\u00e9e has chilled, measure out 3 tablespoons (45 milliliters). If you have any left over, you can store them in the fridge in a small bottle or jar. Cream the butter and cream cheese together until smooth, about 30 seconds. You can do this in a bowl using a handheld mixer. You can also use a stand mixer or a food processor fitted with whisks.

Add \u2153 cup (80 milliliters) of chilled strawberry pur\u00e9e or strawberry jam. You can use something that you bought from the store, or you can make your own. Beat everything together until stiff peaks form. You want the color and texture to be even and consistent. If you are using a handheld mixer, be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl.
