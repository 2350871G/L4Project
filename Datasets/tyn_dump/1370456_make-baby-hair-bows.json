Then, cut one 4 in (10 cm) long piece of \u20448 in (0.95 cm) wide ribbon, which you will wrap around the center of your baby bow. Measure the 2 pieces of ribbon with a ruler and cut them with a sharp pair of fabric scissors. Choose 2 kinds of ribbon that complement each other. Also, make sure to select ribbon in prints, colors, and textures that you like. Since you will be folding the ribbon in half, a 4 in (10 cm) long piece of ribbon will create a 2 in (5.1 cm) bow, while a 6 in (15 cm) piece will create a 3 in (7.6 cm) bow."
