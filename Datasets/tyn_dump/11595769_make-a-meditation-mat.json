Buy a piece of fabric that is 59 in (150 cm) long by 21 in (53 cm) wide. Purchase a section of fabric in your chosen color from a fabric store. These dimensions will allow you to cut out the 3 necessary pieces for the meditation mat. This is to make a round cushion-style meditation mat, also known as a zafu meditation pillow. Cut a 59 in (150 cm) long by 6\u20139 in (15\u201323 cm) wide fabric strip.

Assembling and Sewing the Cushion Fold and iron pleats into the long strip of fabric. Start 6.5 in (17 cm) from 1 end of the strip and make 3 marks 0.75 in (1.9 cm) apart, then repeat this every 3 in (7.6 cm).
