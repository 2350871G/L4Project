Nonetheless, priming the surface won't hurt, so it might be worth consideration. Use an acrylic PVA (latex-based) wallboard primer capable of sealing the pores in your drywall. Apply the primer in a smooth, even coat with a standard paint roller, then let it dry completely before continuing. Those in favor of priming argue that the process can encourage even drying while also limiting the potential shrinkage of the applied joint compound. Good primer fills in and seals the pores of the drywall, thereby preventing the mud from seeping into those pores and shrinking in volume."
