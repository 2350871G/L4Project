Non-dairy milk, such as rice or soy, will not work. Stir in 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of white vinegar. It does not matter whether or not the vinegar is distilled.The purpose of the vinegar is to help separate the curds from the whey. If this is for an experiment, try using distilled vinegar in 1 batch and non-distilled vinegar in another. Cook the solution over low to medium heat until lumps form. Reduce the heat to low, then let the solution heat up, stirring often. After about 3 minutes, you should start seeing solid lumps form. These lumps are the curds! If it is taking too long for the lumps or curds to form, turn the heat up to medium. Pour the solution through a strainer. Set a strainer over a glass, mug, or bowl.
