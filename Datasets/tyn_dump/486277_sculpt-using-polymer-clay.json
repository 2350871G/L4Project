                    "description": "One of the best things about polymer clay is that it doesn\u2019t require expensive equipment to get started. Head to a department or craft store and pick out some polymer clay and a few sculpting tools. Alternatively, choose a beginner sculpting set for a convenient way to get everything you need. To start, make sure you have a roller, clay blade, and a few sculpting tools, like those with balls or rubber tips at the end to create various shapes. You can also use items that you find around your home as sculpting tools. Look for anything that can be used to make interesting details on the clay. Popular choices include sewing needles, knitting needles, craft knives, dental tools, pens, pencils, and toothpicks. Polymer clay comes in a variety of colors and consistencies. Choose firm polymer clay if you want to work with clay that holds its shape better. Alternatively, pick soft polymer clay if you are after a type that is easier to shape and stretch. Cover your work surface with a non-porous material like a plastic placemat to keep the oil in the clay from leaching into your table or desk."

Press the clay in your fingers and massage it in your palms to begin warming it up. Roll the clay into a ball and don\u2019t be afraid to break it into smaller pieces that are easier to work with. Continue bending and rolling the clay until it feels soft enough to mold. Aim for the clay to reach a stretchy, malleable consistency.Tip: If the clay is too firm and won\u2019t soften in your hands, simply place it into a resealable plastic bag and keep the bag in your pocket for approximately 30 minutes. Alternatively, run the plastic bag full of clay under hot water for 2-3 minutes or until it feels soft."

For example, if you want to make a model of a head, shape the face, eyes, eyebrows, ears, nose, and mouth separately first. Then, put them all together by gently pressing the pieces of clay into each other. Remember that if you make a mistake, you can simply remold the clay."

Try out a variety of different tools to see the shapes that each tool can make. Get creative and use the tools by pressing, dragging, or rolling them into the clay. If you don\u2019t like the effect, simply smooth the area out with your fingers and try a different way or tool. Flatten the clay with a rolling pin or ruler. You can create flat, thin pieces or shapes with flat sides like squares or rectangles. Sewing needles are great for making small indents, while knitting needles are ideal for larger impressions. Wire loop-shaped tools are great for creating circular patterns and craft knives are perfect for making intricate markings and lines. If a tool sticks or doesn't glide easily, dip it into water first and then try using it again."
