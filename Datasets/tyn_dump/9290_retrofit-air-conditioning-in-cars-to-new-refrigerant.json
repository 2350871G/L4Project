Watch your high pressure gauge. When the gauge reads 225 to 250 PSI, close the valve on your refrigerant can. Always close the valve before disconnecting the can so that you don't spray refrigerant into the atmosphere. Generally, your A/C will take in about 12 ounces (355 ml) of refrigerant. If your system isn't fully charged after your refrigerant can is depleted, then you can add another can of refrigerant until your gauge reads in the right PSI range. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/2f\\/Retrofit-Air-Conditioning-in-Cars-to-New-Refrigerant-Step-16Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Retrofit-Air-Conditioning-in-Cars-to-New-Refrigerant-Step-16Bullet2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/2f\\/Retrofit-Air-Conditioning-in-Cars-to-New-Refrigerant-Step-16Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Retrofit-Air-Conditioning-in-Cars-to-New-Refrigerant-Step-16Bullet2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Finish the Job Store your refrigerant can with the service hose attached.
