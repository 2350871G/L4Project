Canine wipes are the best cleanser to use on your dog\u2019s wrinkles, but you can also use a soft wash cloth, cotton balls, or cotton swabs to clean the folds. If you are using one of these options, moisten the object with a 50/50 mixture of high-quality rinse-free canine shampoo and water first. If you choose to clean your pug\u2019s wrinkles with a shampoo-water mix, avoid using regular soap or shampoo that requires rinsing. Soaps can dry out and irritate your dog\u2019s skin if not rinsed off completely. Clean your dog\u2019s wrinkles at least once a day. Doing so several times a day\u2014particularly after your dog eats\u2014is even better for keeping the folds clean. Keep an eye on any areas you notice are infected or have a strong odor. If these areas do not improve after a day or 2, make an appointment with your vet."

To do so, use a small nail clipper or nail grinder and clip only the curved part of the nail. Watch out for the quick, which is the vein running through your dog\u2019s foot. Be careful not to cut this vein when you are clipping your dog\u2019s nails. A good time to cut your dog\u2019s nails is when they are in a deep sleep at night. Even if your pug wakes up while you are trimming its nails, it will probably be too drowsy to put up a struggle. If you accidentally clip the quick while trimming your dog\u2019s nails, apply some styptic powder to the cut to help stop the bleeding and prevent infection. Depending on the types of surfaces your dog encounters on a regular basis, you may only need to clip its nails every 3-6 months. Walking on hard outdoor surfaces frequently may help keep the nails filed down. You should still check its nails every few weeks to make sure they\u2019re not getting too long, however."

Say the words \u201cteeth\u201d or \u201cbrush\u201d while you do this so your dog will begin to associate these key words with getting its teeth brushed.

Don\u2019t moisten the cotton ball with plain water, as this can introduce too much moisture to your pug\u2019s ears and increase the risk of infection. Ask your vet to recommend a good antimicrobial ear cleaner. Many canine ear cleansers are also designed to cause the pores in the dog\u2019s skin to tighten, preventing moisture and bacteria from entering the tissues of the ear canal.

        "Brushing your pug both before and after you bathe it will also help cut down on shedding.",
        "Bathing will loosen up the hairs in your dog\u2019s coat, so brushing it after its bath will help catch many of these loose hairs.",
        "Trim your Pug\u2019s nails.",
        "Pugs\u2019 nails grow extremely fast.",
        "Trim your dog\u2019s nails every 2 weeks to make sure they do not get too long.",
        "To do so, use a small nail clipper or nail grinder and clip only the curved part of the nail.",
        "Watch out for the quick, which is the vein running through your dog\u2019s foot.",
        "Be careful not to cut this vein when you are clipping your dog\u2019s nails.",
        "A good time to cut your dog\u2019s nails is when they are in a deep sleep at night.",
        "Even if your pug wakes up while you are trimming its nails, it will probably be too drowsy to put up a struggle.",
        "If you accidentally clip the quick while trimming your dog\u2019s nails, apply some styptic powder to the cut to help stop the bleeding and prevent infection.",
        "Depending on the types of surfaces your dog encounters on a regular basis, you may only need to clip its nails every 3-6 months.",
        "Walking on hard outdoor surfaces frequently may help keep the nails filed down.",
        "You should still check its nails every few weeks to make sure they\u2019re not getting too long, however.",

        "Do your best to touch all of the teeth.",
        "Say the words \u201cteeth\u201d or \u201cbrush\u201d while you do this so your dog will begin to associate these key words with getting its teeth brushed.",
        "Praise your dog when it sits still for this and offer it a small, healthy treat at the end of each session.",
        "For the following week, use a canine finger tooth brush or a small breed toothbrush to go over the teeth.",
        "Wet the brush, but don\u2019t apply toothpaste.",
        "Remember to say the key word while you are doing this.",
        "At the end of the week you can start using a toothbrush with toothpaste on it.",
        "Brush your pug\u2019s teeth regularly.",
        "It is recommended you spend 3-4 minutes brushing your dog\u2019s teeth every day.",
        "Make sure you cover the front, back, and sides of all teeth.",
        "Be sure you\u2019re cleaning all the surfaces of the teeth and invest in a quality canine toothpaste, as human toothpastes can be toxic to dogs if they are swallowed.",
        "Keep using the key word when you brush your dog\u2019s teeth.",

        "Don\u2019t moisten the cotton ball with plain water, as this can introduce too much moisture to your pug\u2019s ears and increase the risk of infection.",
        "Ask your vet to recommend a good antimicrobial ear cleaner.",
        "Many canine ear cleansers are also designed to cause the pores in the dog\u2019s skin to tighten, preventing moisture and bacteria from entering the tissues of the ear canal.",
        "If you notice any pus, excessive liquid wax, or irritated areas in your dog\u2019s ears, take it to the vet.",
        "These symptoms can indicate an infection of some kind.",
        "Clean your pug\u2019s eyes.",

        "Clean your dog\u2019s eyes daily with a baby wipe, moistened cotton ball, or canine eye wipes.",

        "Wipe your dog\u2019s face with a clean wipe after cleaning out the eye to keep any leftover debris away from its face.",
        "Bathing Your Pug Fill your tub with about 3 inches of water.",
        "Pugs need to be bathed approximately every 3 weeks.",
        "To start, fill your bathtub, laundry tub, or another basin with about 3 inches (7.6 cm) of warm water.",
        "Use the inside of your wrist to check the water temperature before you begin, as water that is too hot can irritate your dog\u2019s skin.",
        "Running water can make pugs somewhat skittish, so fill the tub or basin before putting your dog in it.",
        "If the tub or basin you\u2019re using is slippery, place a non-slip mat on the bottom of it to keep your pug from sliding around.",
        "Wet your pug\u2019s coat.",

        "Be careful not to get shampoo into its eyes, nose, or ears.",
        "Use only dog shampoo, as human shampoo can be too harsh for a pug.",
        "Wipe your dog\u2019s folds with a washcloth.",
        "Take a soft washcloth and gently wipe the folds around your dog\u2019s nose and mouth.",
        "You may need to lift the top of the fold with your hand in order to access the skin underneath the fold.",
        "Rinse well.",
        "When you are done lathering the shampoo and scrubbing your dog\u2019s skin, rinse the shampoo out well.",
        "Shampoo that is left on the skin can be drying, so make sure you get it all out.",
        "Use your hands and fingers to work the shampoo down your dog\u2019s body and out of its coat.",
        "Apply conditioner to your dog\u2019s coat.",
        "After rinsing, apply a dog conditioner to your pet\u2019s coat.",
        "Using shampoo alone can be too drying, so applying conditioner will help keep your dog\u2019s skin moisturized and prevent hair breakage.",
        "Work the conditioner into your dog\u2019s coat, making sure you get it down to the skin.",
        "Rinse well.",
        "Once the conditioner is worked in, rinse your dog\u2019s coat well, using your hands and fingers to massage the skin to help get all of the conditioner out.",

        "Once all of the shampoo and conditioner is rinsed out of your dog\u2019s coat, use an absorbent towel to pat your pug dry.",
        "Try to avoid rubbing with the towel, as this can irritate your dog\u2019s skin.",
        "A pug\u2019s coat can hold quite a bit of water, so you may need to go over the coat several times with the towel before all the excess water is removed.",
        "Keep a couple towels handy in case you need to switch to a dry towel to get the rest of the water from your pug\u2019s coat."
