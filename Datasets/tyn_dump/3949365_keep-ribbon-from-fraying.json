Snip the edge at a 45-degree angle, or cut it in an inverted \u201cv\u201d shape to discourage fraying. Purchase clear nail polish. Use a good quality, trusted brand that you know encourages long wear. Dip the nail polish brush into the nail polish. Wipe the brush on the top of the bottle to remove excess polish. Apply a thin layer to the edges of the ribbon. You can either hold the ribbon in your hand and paint it at the very edge or lay it flat and paint one side, and then flip it and paint the other side.
