        "Fold the edge of the new gasket over the rubber band.",
        "Use your fingers to pry up the edge of the gasket that\u2019s overlapping the material of the drysuit.",
        "Peel it back and roll it over the rubber band to expose the underside of the gasket material.",
        "Apply a thin line of repair adhesive on the underside of the gasket.",
        "Take a tube of repair adhesive and spread a continuous line around the underside of the gasket that you folded over the rubber band.",
        "Make sure there aren\u2019t any gaps in the line so the adhesive forms a tight seal.You can find repair adhesive at diving supply shops and online.",
        "Popular brands of repair adhesive include Gear Aid Aquaseal and M Essentials Aquaseal.",
        "Roll the gasket back over the material and wrap masking tape around it.",
        "Once you\u2019ve applied the repair adhesive, carefully unroll the gasket back over the material of the drysuit as evenly as you can.",
        "Use your hands to smooth out the material so there aren\u2019t any air bubbles trapped.",
        "Then, take a roll of masking tape and apply a strip of tape around the gasket so it\u2019s pressed tightly against the adhesive.The tape will ensure that the adhesive cures as thinly as possible to create a tight seal.",
        "Allow the adhesive to cure overnight then remove the tape.",
        "The adhesive takes at least 8 hours to cure, so leave the drysuit alone until then.",
        "Once it\u2019s done, remove the rubber band and take out the foam form or object.If there are any seams or rips where the gasket connects to the suit, you\u2019ll need to repeat the process and make sure you apply the adhesive properly.",
        "Seal the drysuit and inflate it with a pump.",
        "Use 2 plastic cups to seal the sleeves of the suit, but poke a hole that fits the end of your pump into 1 of the cups.",
        "Zip up the suit zipper and tie off the neck with a bungee cord or string.",
        "Place the end of the hand pump into the hole in the cup and inflate the suit.Leave the pump in the opening in the cup so you can add more air as the suit deflates.",
        "Be careful not to overinflate the suit.",
        "Spray a soap and water solution on the gasket and check for leaks.",
        "Take a spray bottle and fill it with warm water.",
        "Add a few drops of dish soap into it and shake it to combine the mixture.",
        "Spray the gasket and the edges where it connects to the suit.",
        "Check for bubbles that would indicate that the suit isn\u2019t sealed.Apply more adhesive to the edges of the gasket if there are bubbles.",
        "An unsealed gasket can cause water to enter your drysuit."
