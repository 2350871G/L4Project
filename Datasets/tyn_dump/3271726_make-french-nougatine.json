    "text": " Sliced almond nougatine Gather the ingredients. You'll need:\n4 cups sugar\n1 cup sliced almonds\nRaisins (optional). Melt the sugar in a heavy-based saucepan. Heat until the sugar caramelizes, stirring frequently. Add about a tablespoon of water until it forms a nice, gloopy texture. Wait for it to cool for three minutes.  Pour two thirds of the mixture onto a sheet of waxed paper. Place the paper on a baking sheet, to provide firmness underneath. Fold the paper in half, with the sugar sandwiched between. Then press it down, spreading the mixture until it is about \u20443 centimeter (0.1 in) thick. Mix the remaining third of the sugar mixture into the almonds. Using its own sheet of waxed paper, proceed as for steps 5 and 6. Place the spread mixtures in the refrigerator. Allow to chill for about 6-10 minutes, at which point the mixture will be half cold. Remove from the fridge. Use a knife to cut both slices into neat squares. Peeling off the waxed paper, stack the squares. Stack them in this order: Plain sugar square, almond square, plain sugar square, almond square, plain sugar square. If the nougatine is still slightly too cold to be sandwiched, use a teeny bit of syrup to stick the pieces together.  Place the finished stacks in the freezer for a bit. This will firm them up. Remove from the freezer after about a half hour to an hour. They're now ready to serve. Crushed almond nougatine Gather the ingredients. You'll need:\n200g/7 oz/1 cup of caster or superfine sugar\n4 teaspoons liquid glucose\n100g/4 oz/1 cup ground almonds. Prepare the baking sheet. Oil it with an edible vegetable oil. Pour the sugar and liquid glucose into a heavy-based saucepan. Melt over a high heat. Stir constantly with a wooden spoon. Add the ground almonds when the sugar mixture turns a light brown. Stir well. Transfer to an oiled baking sheet. Allow to cool slightly, and set just a little. If the nougatine is to form the base of a cake, transfer it straight into the base of the oiled cake pan instead. Oil a rolling pin. Use this to roll out the nougatine mixture on the baking sheet. Roll to the desired thickness. Cut shapes out of the nougatine. Use an oiled biscuit or cookie cutter. Once completely cooled, transfer to an airtight container for storage. Or, serve. Hazelnut nougatine Gather the ingredients. You'll need:\n30g of hazelnuts, shelled\n50g sugar. Chop the hazelnuts using a large knife. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Add the sugar to a heavy-based saucepan. Heat over a medium heat to melt it. Stir frequently to prevent burning, or turn down the heat. Stir well when it starts to turn a light caramel color. This will increase its liquid state. Add the chopped hazelnuts. Mix through quickly. Remove from the heat.Transfer the sugar and nut mixture to the baking sheet lined with parchment paper.  Place another sheet of baking paper over the top of the mixture. Using a rolling pin, roll over the top to flatten the nougatine mixture as thinly as possible. Work quickly, as the caramel will be setting as you roll. Allow the entire sheet, paper and all, to completely cool down to set.  Remove the set nougatine from the pieces of parchment paper. Using your hands, break into small shards. Serve. The nougatine is now ready to eat. Store what hasn't been eaten in an airtight container, although there won't be a lot, so maybe it will all be eaten!",
