Use a stand or electric mixer to beat the ingredients on high speed for several minutes. The mixture should look light and fluffy. Your butter and cream cheese must be soft.

Beat the sugar cookie dough just until it's combined and you no longer see pockets of flour. Scoop the dough onto plastic wrap and shape it into a disk. Wrap the disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for one hour. Chilling is important because it will make the cookies easier to roll and will prevent them from being tough."
