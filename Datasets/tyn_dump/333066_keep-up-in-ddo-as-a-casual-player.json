For a casual player, it might take a month or more to level up using this method. Or, you could build a level 10 to 14  party that includes a couple of good level 14 players, and then do Madstone Crater on normal, hard, and elite difficulties. The base XP of Madstone Crater is around 15,000 XP. You will get a conquest bonus without any extra effort most of the time, which is about 3250 XP. You will get a first time bonus of either 3250 or 6500 depending on difficulty. And you will get a few other bonuses as you complete it. So, even with the 50% penalty, you will be getting over 15,000 XP on normal and hard, and over 18,000 XP on elite. Continue this with other Gianthold quests and you will soon level up to where you are no longer taking a penalty."
