Extra care can be taken with the placement of the stems, too. Remember, the three important things about doing vases:\nBe sure the ellipse or curvature at the foot of the vase carries up and is repeated on the mouth of the vase. Avoid a flat, straight across line. Also, if there are designs on the vase, have them adapt to the shape of the vase and not be painted flat. Stripes going around the vase need to contour to the roundness of the object. Finally, every arrangement will cast a shadow on the table surface. Keep it transparent, neutral in color and do it fast and in one swipe. Do not try to alter or edit that shadow shape."
