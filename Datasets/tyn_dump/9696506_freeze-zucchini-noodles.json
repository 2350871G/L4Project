To make sure you store your zucchini noodles for an appropriate amount of time, put a label on each bag and write the initial freeze date on it. If you created different portion sizes for each bag, consider listing the amount of zucchini noodles as well. Store your zoodles in a freezer for up to 1 year. Like most forms of summer squash, you can keep zucchini noodles in your freezer for up to 12 months. However, they may become less flavorful over time, so try to eat them as soon as possible.
