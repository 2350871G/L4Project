To remove the door, lift it upward while pulling the bottom away from the track along the bottom. Then, place the door on a flat surface. If you have a door handle in the way of your screen, remove the screws with a flathead screwdriver to take it off. The door should easily come off with moderate force. Not all door styles will have a door handle overlapping the screen. If your screen door is on hinges, tap the hinge pins with a screwdriver to remove them and slide the door upward from the hinges."

Be careful when removing the splines. If they are still in good shape, you can reuse them. If you pierce the splines or damage them, throw them away and get new splines that have the same diameter as the old ones."
