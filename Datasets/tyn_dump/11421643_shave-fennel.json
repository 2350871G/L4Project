While holding the bulb steady, slice straight down through each stalk to remove it. To cleanly cut through the fennel, use a sharp knife. Pick one that is big enough to cut all the way through the fennel, such as a chef\u2019s knife. The stalks and frond leaves have plenty of flavor, so consider saving them for another use.

The root end of the bulb may need to be trimmed a little to even it out. Cut gradually and test the bulb by standing it on its root end.
