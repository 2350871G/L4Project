The hijab is not just a piece of cloth that covers hair - it covers and protects your whole self, including your mannerisms, speech, your gaze, and your heart. It changes you mentally and spiritually by identifying you as a Muslim. Think of it as a way for Allah azza wajjal to protect the women. As soon as you wear the hijab, your whole perspective on self-respect and values will automatically change. Quran 24:30-31 explains that women should pull their headcovers (khumur) over their chests or breasts, and Quran 33:59-60 says that veiling will help women be recognized as Muslims. A hadith narrated by the Prophet's wife Aisha says that Allah will not accept prayer from a woman who has reached puberty unless she wears hijab."

But this does not mean you cant wear nice clothes. Sober or pastel colours, such as black, brown, blue and green are recommended. Remember that it is obligatory to cover the whole body except the face, hands, and sometimes the feet, although some scholars believe it's obligatory to cover those as well (especially in the Hanbali school of thought). If you truly believe it is obligatory or wish to seek additional rewards, then make the effort to cover your face with the niqaab and your hands with gloves, as no harm can come from it. There isn't one \"right\" way to cover. Some Muslims believe you can leave your face visible, while others believe it's required to cover it (i.e., wearing niqab). Some say the feet can be left uncovered, while others disagree. In many cases, it's considered sufficient to cover your hair, ears, neck, and most of your body, though if you have questions or are uncertain, talk to other Muslims about it."

        "If you choose to avoid befriending boys, learn how to politely reject interaction with boys who approach you.",
        "Avoid friends that bring bad influences, that harm or hurt your feelings or hold you back from your study and worship.",
        "There isn't a clear-cut answer on befriending non-Muslims.",
        "Some Muslims think it's haram because you could be distracted from Islam and stop believing, while others think it's accepted by Allah and that it's important to be tolerant.",
