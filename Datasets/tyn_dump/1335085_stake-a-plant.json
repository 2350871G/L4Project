            "description": "If you have a fast-growing plant, you may need to re-stake them every few months. Consider how large the plant will be in a year, and stake accordingly. The stake should be about 12 inches (30.5 cm) higher than the plant. Additionally, if your plant is in an area that doesn't suffer from strong winds, you may be able to use 1 to 2 stakes. For gustier winds, plan for at least 3 stakes. If you're using wooden stakes, make sure the wood is left untreated. Stains or paints on the wood may contain chemicals that can leach into the soil. Reusable garden stakes are a long-lasting option and fold easily for winter storage. Ideal for vegetable plants, these stakes might come in L shapes and hook closely together to make whatever size you desire."
