        "Do this for 6 or 7 more pieces to create a 3-D felt flower.",

        "Sewing a Rickrack Flower Brooch Cut your desired length of rickrack.",

        "Pull until the thread is taut to secure the end of the rickrack.",
        "Make sure that the raw edge of the rickrack is facing away from you when you tack it down.Tip: Use a needle that is durable enough to puncture thicker material.",
        "A thin needle could snap if forced through multiple layers of rickrack.",
        "Sew each loop together across the bottom of your rickrack.",
        "Use your fingers to hold the first 2 bottom loops together and then insert the needle through both.",
        "Pull the thread taut.",

        "Sew back and forth across the rickrack circle to secure the pieces together more firmly.",
        "Make sure to sew on the back side of your rickrack flower so that these stitches will not be visible.",

        "Press the flower onto the felt circle and hold it there for about 15 seconds if you are using hot glue.",
        "Place the pin near the top of the circle.",
        "Sewing it in the middle will cause the brooch to sag when you are wearing it.",
