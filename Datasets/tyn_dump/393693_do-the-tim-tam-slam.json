You may find that the long, thin version of Tim Tams, Tim Tam Fingers, make an even better straw.

Some beverages will absorb more quickly than others, but eventually your Tim Tam will become saturated. Timing is important at this point in the slam. If you wait too long, your Tim Tam might fall apart into your drink. If you jump the gun, you might find your Tim Tam hasn't reached optimal saturation. You should avoid drinking beverages that are too hot with your Tim Tam. This could result in you burning your mouth! If your drink just came out of the coffee pot, microwave, or off the stove, you may want to wait a few minutes."
