                    "description": "Antihistamine creams and tablets are medications that can ease an itch resulting from an allergic reaction. They work by blocking histamines binding to your cells and thus, prevent the release of mediators that cause the symptoms of allergy (including itching). Apply Benadryl (diphenhydramine) topical cream to the skin or take oral tablets/liquid before bedtime. Besides helping with the itching, oral Benadryl also causes drowsiness, which can help you sleep better. If you have large areas of skin that itches, you should choose an oral anti-histamine instead of putting a topical cream on a large area. However, choose either the topical cream or the oral diphenhydramine. Never use both together or you could be exposed to too much of the medication. Always follow the directions in the label and never exceed the recommended dose. Other antihistamines you can try include over-the-counter Zyrtec (cetirizine) and Claritin (loratadine). Make sure you check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking oral medications if you have medical conditions, allergies to medicines, or take other medications."

If the itching is caused by an inflammatory condition (such as eczema), try using corticosteroid cream. When using corticosteroid cream, you may want to cover the area with a damp cotton material soaked in water. This will help the skin absorb the cream. Corticosteroid creams are available in mild forms over-the-counter, or stronger by prescription only. If the itchy area isn\u2019t large, your doctor may prescribe calcineurin inhibitor drugs (such as Protopic or Elidel) instead of corticosteroid creams."
