                    "description": "One of the benefits of clear plastic bottles is that it is easy to identify what is inside. This makes clear plastic bottles excellent storage containers for dried goods, spices, or snacks\u2014especially since you can usually seal them tightly to keep their contents safe during storage. Make sure that you don\u2019t heat the bottle in the microwave or set it in hot water. Certain kinds of bottles have added benefits as well. In particular, coffee creamer bottles come with caps that make pouring quite easy. Make sure to check the number inside of the triangle at the bottom of plastic bottles before using them to store food. Any plastic bottle with a #2, #4, or #5 printed at the bottom of the bottle is safe for food storage, but bottles with a #4 may not hold up in the long term."

                    "description": "You can make a pencil and pen organizer for your desk with very little effort. First, use a knife to cut the plastic bottle to your desired length by cutting it in half. Then, use a pair of scissors to trim any sharp or rough edges. Lastly, you can use a steam iron to heat the edges a little bit and smooth them out, although sandpaper also works. You can paint or decorate the bottle to give it a personal touch! Be careful when heating the edges of a bottle with a steam iron. Use the lowest possible setting or you\u2019ll warp the plastic. Half the height of a standard 16 oz. water bottle works well for pen and pencil storage, but you\u2019ll want to cut higher for longer materials like paintbrushes, or pipe cleaners."

Whether you\u2019re priming a fresh canvas or touching up the trim in a freshly painted room, repurposing a bottle as a paint tray or easel is easy enough. If the bottle\u2019s opening is too small to dip your brush into, simply cut an opening of 6 to 8 in (15 to 20 cm) in to the side of the bottle on the opposite side of the handle and make one. Many people prefer using a bottle like this to a purchasable paint tray because the sharp edge left by your cut makes it easy to get excess paint off of your brush. To remove excess paint with the edge, simply press your bristles in to the edge while pulling your brush out and you\u2019ll see the excess paint drip nicely back into the rest of the paint in the bottle."
