        "Instead, complete the massage, then ask her if she's enjoying it.",
        "Assuming she says yes, try gently kissing her feet a few times.",
        "After 20-30 seconds or so, look up and ask, \"How are you enjoying it now?\"",
        "If she isn\u2019t into the foot kissing and seems ready for the massage to end, take the cue and stop trying to seduce her for now.",
        "But don\u2019t worry, your efforts may pay dividends at another time!",
        "Ask if you can massage the rest of her.",
        "This is a big step, so word the question in a way that gives her a clear signal of what you\u2019re hoping will happen.",
        "Simply saying, \"Can I massage the rest of you?\"",
        "might just work wonders on its own.",
        "If you think she's in the mood and you want to try something a little more seductive, say, \"The rest of you looks tired too.",
        "Can I take care of that for you?\"",
        "Say \"yes\" if she asks to massage you.",
        "In some cases, she may want to turn the tables and give you a massage.",
        "This is usually a strong signal that she wants to go further than just a massage, so you should definitely agree.",
        "Don't blurt out \"heck yeah!\"",
        "or mutter \"I guess,\" though.",
        "Instead, say \"sure\" or \"yes I would\" in your seductive voice!",
        "Sometimes a massage is just a massage, however, so don't assume too much.",
        "Just enjoy the massage and, if anything beyond that happens, think of it as the icing on the cake!"
