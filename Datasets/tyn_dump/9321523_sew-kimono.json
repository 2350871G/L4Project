Try using a fabric like chiffon, silk, lightweight cotton, or a knit blend for the best results. You may choose a solid color or a print fabric for your kimono. Your fabric piece will need to measure 40\u201d (107 cm) by 55\u201d (140 cm). To save time, you might consider asking the store associate to cut your fabric to these exact dimension. If you cannot get this exact measurement from a fabric store, then measure and cut your piece to these dimensions when you get it home. This size fabric piece will create a kimono that falls around or just below your hips. If you want your kimono to be longer, then get a piece of fabric that is longer than 55\u201d (140 cm), such as a 40\u201d (107 cm) by 65\u201d (165 cm) piece. The 40\u201d size piece will result in sleeves that are about 3/4 length. If you want longer or short sleeves, then adjust the width of your fabric piece. For example, if you want longer sleeves, then you might go with a piece of fabric that is 48\u201d (122 cm) by 55\u201d (140 cm)."
