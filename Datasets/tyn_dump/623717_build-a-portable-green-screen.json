If you want a green screen wider than that, look for fabric that comes in a 54\" or 60\u201d width, or sew two pieces of fabric together for an even larger size. It\u2019s also a good idea to iron your fabric so that it is free of wrinkles before use as a green screen. Visible wrinkles that show up on camera will interfere with the keying process that replaces the color with another image. If you cannot find a suitable green color of fabric, you may be able to paint or dye fabric to your desired shade. However, this method may not turn out as even or consistent as a pre-dyed fabric."

Get A clamps (or spring clamps) to clamp the fabric to the top of the frame. You will also use these to attach the fabric smoothly to the sides of the frame, so you can grab a few more with very little expense from a hardware store. Try sewing a \u201cpocket\u201d into the top of the fabric by folding it over and sewing to create a long loop through which to slide the PVC pipe. Use approximately 6 inch pieces of elastic band fabric, folded over to create loops large enough to fit around your PVC pipe. Then sew or staple these loops to the fabric wherever you want it to connect to your frame."

Then use two microphone stands with the extensions removed and slide the side pieces of PVC pipe over the mic stands so the frame stands upright.
