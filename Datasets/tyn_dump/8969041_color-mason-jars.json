The newspaper will protect your work surface from Mod Podge and food coloring spills. Clean your jar. You must do this if you are re-using an old mason jar. Wipe the inside and outside of the jar with a cotton swab soaked in rubbing alcohol. Then wash the jar with soap and water. Use a clean, dry towel to dry the jar. If you are using new, unused mason jars, then just rinse the jars with water, and dry them with a clean towel. Mix together your Mod Podge and water. Pour 4 tablespoons (60 ml) of Mod Podge onto a paper plate. Then mix in 2 tablespoons (15 ml) of water.
