A large, sterile gravel parking lot can also be used for spraying out the last bit of remaining product as a last resort to storing it for transfer to a proper disposal site if absolutely necessary. Avoid spraying it in the most heavily trafficked part of the gravel lot. Choose an out-of-the-way location, such as near a fence."

Ammonia is effective for most herbicides, but not all. Research your particular herbicide to see if a bleach solution, powdered detergent, or kerosene solution would be better. A de-greasing liquid dish soap also works well, especially on petroleum based chemicals. You can also purchase a commercial tank cleaner at a hardware or home improvement store.
