        "A big door might make your castle look even harder to break into!",
        "If you\u2019re drawing a castle from the side, the door may not be visible at all.",
        "Keep in mind the angle you have chosen for your drawing.",
        "Sketch windows along the castle by drawing small arches.",
        "People need some way to look out of the castle, so add a couple of windows along the front.",
        "Try drawing a pair of windows above the door, keeping them about \u20444 in (0.64 cm) from the top.",
        "Place a single window in the center of each tower section and then 3 more on the outer walls.",
        "To draw simple windows, make them the same shape as the door.",
        "Draw a small, horizontal line, then draw an upside-down U-shape over it.",
        "The window positioning, size, and shape can vary a lot.",
        "It\u2019s your design, so draw them how you want them!",
        "Top the outer walls with rectangles about \u20444 in (0.64 cm) tall.",
        "Start at the edges of the wall.",
        "Draw  a short, horizontal line, followed by a vertical line that stops short of the walls.",
        "Repeat this to form a series of small blocks similar to what you see on real castles.",
        "The blocks are small areas to protect people as they look down from the castle walls.",
        "Make them look nice by keeping them small and spaced consistently.",
        "Draw \u20444 in (0.64 cm) blocks along the top of the keep.",
        "To distinguish the keep, make the blocks a little different than the ones on the wall.",
        "Try drawing half squares coming out of the top of the keep.",
        "Space them out consistently, leaving small gaps between them so the people in the castle have room to look out.",
        "If you wanted to, you could erase the outline forming the roof of the keep and replace it with these small squares.",
        "Try making these rectangles a little bigger than the ones on the towers to distinguish them.",
        "Finish the door with some horizontal lines and other decorations.",
        "The simplest way to make the door stand out is with a series of lines consistently spaced out across its width.",
        "Try measuring about \u20448 in (0.32 cm) from the edge of the door.",
        "Then, draw a straight line from top to bottom.",
        "Keep doing this until you have run out of room.",
        "To ensure these lines are spaced out more evenly, measure the width of the door first.",
        "Take the measurement across the bottom or middle part of the door where it is widest.",
        "For additional decoration, you could draw a pair of thin wooden bars running across the door\u2019s width.",
        "Try placing them \u20443 in (0.85 cm) of the way from the top and bottom edges.",
        "You could also draw an arch around the door to make it look like it has a wood frame.",
        "Sketch pennants coming from the top of each tower for optional detail.",
        "Draw a vertical line out of the peak of each tower to create flagpoles.",
        "Then, make a simple flag by drawing a triangle attached to it.",
        "You could customize it by making it wavy, like it\u2019s blowing in the wind, or by giving it a forked shape similar to a dragon\u2019s tongue.",
        "You could also choose to change the flag size or leave them off the castle.",
        "Customize your castle with different decorations!",
        "Completing the Background and Coloring Draw mountains and other background details if you wish to add them.",
        "Try sketching some mountains behind the castle to make it look like a strong, majestic fortress.",
        "Draw a couple of triangular peaks coming up from behind the castle.",
        "Draw a circle underneath the mountain peaks for snow caps.",
        "Add other details as well, including a sun, flowers, or anything else that could make the scene come to life.",
        "For example, if your castle is on a cliff, shade the cliff to make it look rocky.",
        "Try making a few thin, vertical lines.",
        "Add some horizontal ones and curves for rocks and cliffs.",
        "Erase any outlines or stray makes left on the castle.",
        "If you\u2019re using a pencil, this part will be easy.",
        "Remove anything you don\u2019t plan on keeping for the final version of your drawing.",
        "For example, you could have some stray outlines left over from when you were forming the various parts of the castle.",
        "Make sure the remaining edges look neat so your castle looks magnificent.",
        "Always sketch the castle\u2019s shape and details in pencil first.",
        "You can always draw over and erase the outlines before finishing you\u2019re done Darken parts of the castle walls if you wish to make them more realistic.",
        "Lightly shade some selected spots with a pencil to make them look darker than the surrounding stone.",
        "Try shading a few spots around the sides of the towers, outer walls, and doorways.",
        "To shade them, draw a bunch of thin, diagonal lines or dots close together.",
        "Picture where the shadows are on the castle and shade those areas.",
        "You can also add discolorations to the castle walls to make them look a little more weather-worn and natural.",
        "Shading can be tough, but you don\u2019t need to do it if you\u2019re happy with your design.",
        "Make thin marks across the castle to outline its stones.",
        "Space them out evenly, starting with the horizontal lines.",
        "Using a thin pencil and a ruler, sketch these lines very lightly across the castle.",
        "Then, add vertical lines when needed to divide the castle up into individual building blocks.",
        "Remember that you don\u2019t have to draw each individual stone or make them look perfectly even.",
        "You could sketch a few light lines in some places to make the walls look rough and detailed.",
        "These small details are difficult to get right, so consider using less of them or not including them at all if they affect your design negatively.",
        "Color the castle with markers or something else if you want.",
        "Adding color is optional, but it could make your drawing feel more finished.",
        "Crayons, markers, colored pencils, and all sorts of other tools can be used here.",
        "For a basic design, you might wish to color the tower peaks blue and the flags red.",
        "Then, make the castle walls beige with some black and brown spots.",
        "Color the background elements as well, such as the sky and any mountains you have added.",
        "Make sure the castle contrasts with the background so you can easily admire it!"
