        "For a richer flavor, replace the oil with butter.",
        "Brown the venison cubes.",
        "Place the coated cubes of venison roast in the skillet of hot oil.",
        "Cook, turning frequently, until lightly browned on most sides.",
        "Browning the cubes of meat before adding them to your slow cooker deepens the flavor.",
        "The oil or butter also adds fat to the otherwise lean meat, which will help the meat stay tender and moist during the cooking process.",
        "Place the deer meat in a slow cooker.",
        "Dump the contents of the skillet into your slow cooker, dispersing the venison evenly over the bottom of the appliance.",
        "Do not drain the excess oil.",
        "Pour it into the slow cooker along with the meat.",
        "Add the vegetables.",
        "Layer the cubed potatoes, diced carrots, chopped celery, and chopped onion on top of the meat.",
        "You can alter or omit the vegetables you use, but you should always include onion since the pungent onion flavor helps mask the \"gamey\" taste of venison.",
        "Pour in the broth.",
        "Pour enough broth over the contents of the slow cooker to completely cover the venison.",
        "You do not need to keep all of the vegetables submerged, but the meat itself needs to be submerged if you want it to remain moist.",
        "If you do not have beef broth, chicken broth, vegetable broth, venison stock, or water can be used, instead.",
        "Cook on high for 6 hours.",
        "Cover the slow cooker and cook it on high for 6 hours, or until the vegetables and cubes of meat are tender enough to fall apart.",
        "If you want to prolong the cooking time, switch the slow cooker on low and cook the stew for 8 to 10 hours.",
        "Serve warm.",
        "Switch the slow cooker to warm and serve the venison roast stew directly from the appliance."
