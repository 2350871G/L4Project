            "description": "Put on sunscreen, remaining conscious of the fact that the white sand also reflects solar rays upward. Don't forget the underside of the chin, the underside of your nose (even the septum and edges of the inside of your nostrils--a sunburn there is painful! ), and the underside and back of the ears and earlobe. If you have sensitive eyes, bring sunglasses and a hat as well. Wear an old pair of shoes, or at least bring an extra pair with you. They will definitely get loaded with sand, which is much finer than the sand on beaches. If you don't want too much sand in the car, bring another pair of shoes and put plastic or sheets on the upholstery (but you'll still need to vacuum the interior after your visit, no matter what you do). On the dunes themselves, it is fairly safe to go barefoot, but there is a small risk stepping on litter or a tarantula. The sand itself, though, is easy on bare feet, unless it's in the winter, in which case it can be very cold. It doesn't heat up too much in the summer due to its highly reflective qualities, but it might be uncomfortable for some."
