Cut your meat so that the fillets are no larger than 4 by 6 in (10 by 15 cm). They should not be thicker than \u20442 in (1.3 cm). For thicker cuts of fish, slice it laterally to make 2 thinner slices. Keep your fish refrigerated until you are ready to cook it."

Placing a cast iron skillet directly on the rack of the grill works best. After your grill is heated, it should only take around 5 minutes for the skillet to become hot. Only use skillets that can withstand high temperatures and direct heat. You can also heat a cast iron skillet on the stove on high heat for 10 minutes.
