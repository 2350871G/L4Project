Alternatively, you can use granulated sugar instead of brown sugar. Coconut oil is great for hydrating your skin. However, you can also use olive or grapeseed oil instead."

Add the essential oil drops directly into the bowl and use a fork or a spoon to stir the ingredients thoroughly until they are well combined. Scrape the sides of the bowl while you\u2019re stirring to make sure that all of the ingredients are mixed in. Vanilla is soft and comforting, peppermint is fresh and revitalizing, and lavender is relaxing and calming. If you don\u2019t have essential oils, extracts work just as well. You can find essential oils and extracts at health stores. However, if you\u2019re using an extract rather than an essential oil, use only 1  tsp (4.9 ml) of the extract. This is because some extracts have very strong alcohol fumes, so it\u2019s best to use only a little. Alternatively, you can use a potato masher to combine the ingredients."
