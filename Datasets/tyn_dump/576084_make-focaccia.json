Add 2 teaspoons (11 g) of salt to one side of the bowl and put 2 1/4-ounce (7 g) packages of instant (easy blend) yeast into the opposite side.Did You Know? If the yeast and salt come into direct contact, the salt will kill the yeast and the focaccia won't rise. Instant yeast can be mixed directly into a dough without the need to activate it first."
