Be careful not to add more than 3 cups (710 ml) of flour to the mixture, as this will likely make your buns way too dense. Shaping and Baking the Buns Let the dough rest on a flat surface sprinkled with flour for 10 minutes. Gather a small handful of flour and lightly sprinkle it on a section of clean counter space. Remove the dough from the bowl and set it down on the floured section before placing a large bowl overtop. Let the dough rest under the bowl for 10 minutes. Shape the dough into 12 balls.

Let the oven preheat fully before putting the buns in the oven. Once the dough balls have risen, place the baking sheet in the oven and let them bake for 12-15 minutes or until the tops of the balls are a light golden brown.
