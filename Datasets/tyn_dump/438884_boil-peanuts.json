If you live in the Southeast where peanuts are grown, you may notice signs during the summer that advertise fresh peanuts being sold at roadside farm stands. Purchase roughly two pounds of fresh peanuts to boil. Fresh, green peanuts do not last for longer than a few weeks, so make sure not to buy more than you can boil within that time period. Look for fresh peanuts with a firm, brown shell and a strong nutty smell. Green peanuts do not actually look green. Their name refers to the fact that they have been recently harvested and not dried."
