Measuring Tiles Measure the size of the tiles you want to use and any tile spacers or grout. Decide how many tiles you will need to use to complete your pattern. Ensure level tiles with the use of a batten, or wooden straight edge. Do not measure the tile according to the ceiling or floor, since these surfaces are not always level.

Measure each tile before cutting for a good fit. Allow the tiles to dry for at least 24 to 36 hours. The glue directions should specify the necessary time. Applying Grout Spread grout over the surface of the tile with a grout float. Choose a tile that is water and mold resistant. Clean the surface of the tile with a wet sponge. Run the wet sponge over the surface of the tile. Allow the grout to dry completely. Polish the surface of your tiles with a dry cotton rag. This should remove any remaining grout residue.",
