Sometimes a game will have multiple rulebooks, so ask for recommendations or read online reviews to determine which will be best for your roleplay. If you're making up your own game, think about what kind of limits there should be. Can players rise from the dead, fly, or disappear? If you're playing a fanfiction or historical roleplay, can they act completely different from the original character?
