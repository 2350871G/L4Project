Try printer paper, loose leaf, cardstock, scrapbook paper, drawing paper, handmade paper, or a variety of paper types. Use a stiffer piece of cardstock for the cover, in the color of your choice. Saddle-stitched notebooks work best when they\u2019re left thin. Avoid overstuffing your notebook since it won\u2019t lay flat when it\u2019s done. If you\u2019re using lightweight paper like printer paper, feel free to use up to 15 sheets. For thicker papers, use only 5 or 6 sheets for your notebook. To determine how many pages your notebook will have, multiply the number of sheets you\u2019re using by 2. Each piece of paper will be folded in half, so if you start with 8 sheets of paper you\u2019ll have a 16-page notebook."

If you want a rustic-looking notebook, some slight variations in size can look nice in the finished product.
