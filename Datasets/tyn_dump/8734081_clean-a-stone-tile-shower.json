Use a mild detergent, like dish soap, warm water, and a toothbrush to scrub the grouted cracks between tiles. Rinse the area thoroughly afterwards and repeat as necessary until the grout is clean. Because grout is often dirtier than the tile itself, clean the grout first to prevent it from spreading to the tile. Avoid using general grout cleaners when cleaning the grout of natural stone tile. These often have ingredients that can damage your stone. Stiff bristle brushes can harm the finish of your stone and cause scratches. Only use soft bristle brushes and soft cloths when cleaning."

        "Persistent stains or blemishes that are difficult to treat may require an expert.",
