    "text": " Making a Floral Bouquet Choose flowers that match the shower color scheme. Alternatively, you can choose white flowers so that the corsage remains neutral. The design can be used to create either a lapel or a wrist corsage after the greenery and ribbon are attached. Decide whether you want fresh or silk flowers. If you choose fresh flowers, then be sure to make the corsage within 24 hours of the shower. A silk flower corsage can be made well in advance. If you want fresh flowers, check and see what blooms are in season in your area. Blooms that are in season are easier to find and are often much more affordable. Choose an odd number of blooms for your bouquet. You can choose one large bloom, three medium blooms, or five small blooms. Choose the same blooms or complementary blooms. For instance, choose daisies in one color or a variety of different colored daisies.. Leave about a 3\u201d (8 cm) stem on each bloom. Apply florist wire to the stem. Poke florist\u2019s wire into the base of the blooms. Then, wrap the wire loosely around the length of the stems. For a 3\u201d (8 cm) stem, your wire should go around about seven to nine times. Cut the wire. Wrap the wired stem with florist\u2019s tape. Florist wire can be difficult to cut through, so use proper wire cutters for safety. Wrap florist tape around the wire. This will protect the blooms and hide the wire. Bend the wrapped stems. You want to bend them at a 90\u00b0  angle right at the base of the flower. The flower should face forward instead of upward. Arrange the blooms in a cluster.Twist the wire together to connect the flowers and secure the twisted wire with florist\u2019s tape. When twisting the wire, pinch and twist the wire together to make it as compact (not bumpy) as possible. Making a Baby Sock Bouquet Choose 3 pairs of baby socks. You will use 5 of the 6 socks from the pairs to make the blooms for the corsage. Be sure to save the 6th sock so that the mother-to-be can use all 3 pairs for her baby. This design will also be suitable for either a lapel or a wrist corsage after the greenery and ribbon are attached. Roll each sock into a rosebud. Start at the base, or toe, of the sock and roll inward. Wrap florist\u2019s wire around the center of the rosebud. Hold the blooms in one hand and grab the five wires directly below the blooms with the other hand. Twist the five wires together until you reach the ends. Leave about 3\u201d (8 cm) of wire trailing from the sock. Cut off the remaining wire. Pull gently on the top of the rosebud to  loosen the \u201cpetals.\u201d This will make the baby sock blooms look fuller.  Bend the wire at a 90\u00b0 angle right against the sock fabric. The blooms will now be facing forward, not upward. Arrange the blooms. Twist the florist\u2019s wire together to hold them in place. Wrap the twisted wire in florist\u2019s tape for added security. This will also minimize the sharpness of the wire which could tear the sock or be uncomfortable to wear. Adding Greenery and Attaching the Bouquet Choose any kind of greenery that you desire to add to either the floral or the baby sock bouquet. Popular choices include lily leaves and fern leaves. Choose three to five pieces of greenery, depending on width of the leaves. Choose five pieces of narrower greenery and three pieces of wide leaves. Tape florist\u2019s wire to the backs of the leaves. Leave 3\u201d (8 cm) of wire below the leaves and trim off the rest. Hold the leaves in one hand or place them on a work surface. Keeping the bases of the leaves together, fan out the tops to make a fan-shaped design. Twist the wires holding the stems together. You will want to twist the wires as if you were braiding them. First, twist the right wire underneath the middle one. Then, twist the left wire under the middle one. Repeat this step until the wires are twisted together in a fan shape. These wires should hold together on its own. Cover the twisted wires in florist\u2019s tape. This will avoid annoying pokes or damage. Attach the bouquet to the greenery. The blooms should fill the center of the greenery with only the tops of the greenery visible behind the blooms. Twist the wires together to hold the blooms and greenery together. You want to make sure the wires are twisted together tightly to avoid damage. Wrap florist tape around the wire. The twisted wire should be secure in the tape. Adding a Layered Ribbon Choose a ribbon. You can either use a single ribbon in a color that complements the blooms or a sheer ribbon. Or, you can place a sheer ribbon on top of your colored ribbon and tie them together simultaneously. Create a loop of ribbon. It should be about 1/2\u201d to 1\u201d (1-2.5 cm) wider than the diameter of your blossom cluster. Create a loop. It should be the same size and be above your original loop. Continue to form the ribbon into loops. You want four to five loops of a uniform size. Pinch the center of the loops together. Secure the centers with florist\u2019s wire. Leave about 2\u201d (5 cm) of florist\u2019s wire to attach the ribbon to the rest of the corsage. Fan out the loops. This will create the traditional bow look. Tuck the ribbon behind the blooms. The center of the ribbon should be placed at the point where the blooms and the greenery are taped together. Twist the wire around the ribbon\u2019s bottom joint and flowers. This holds the blooms and greenery together. Wrap the connection in florist\u2019s tape. This will hold your corsage together. Trim the ends of the ribbon. Leave a bit of ribbon dangling beneath the blooms. Cut the ribbon at an angle or cut a notch into the ribbon to complete the corsage. Attaching the Corsage to a Lapel Choose a straight pin that has a pearl or other decorative top for best appearance.  Hold the corsage against the lapel (such as that on a blazer or jacket) of the mother-to-be\u2019s shirt. If her shirt has no lapel, then place the corsage between her shoulder seam and her collar. Pull the lapel upward or pull the shirt fabric forward. This will ensure that you don\u2019t stick the pin into the mother-to-be\u2019s skin. Push a straight pin into the mother\u2019s shirt or lapel just above the corsage. The pin should be angled 45\u00b0  to the right of the top of the corsage. If you\u2019re visualizing a clock face, then place the pin at about 1:30. The pin should go into the fabric and then out of the fabric, catching a small piece of fabric as you push it through. Push the pin through the tape-wrapped connection of the greenery, ribbon, and blooms. Be sure the pin goes through the entire corsage. Push the pin into the wearer\u2019s shirt or lapel just below the corsage. Again, let the pin go in and out of the fabric so that the sharp end of the pin is on top of the fabric. Tug gently. This should ensure the stem of the corsage to be secured to the wearer\u2019s lapel or shirt. Creating a Wrist Corsage Choose an appropriate wristband. Use a white or other neutral color of elastic wristband that is covered in gathered fabric or ribbon. You can either purchase a pre-made wristband or make your own using elastic that is covered with gathered fabric. If you make your own, then cut the elastic the length of the circumference of the wearer\u2019s wrist. Stitch the ends together, making sure that they overlap slightly for maximum comfort and the best appearance. Find the seam of the wristband. Wrapping your bouquet around the wristband seam will hide the seam. Coil the stems. Tie the bouquet around the seam so that the bouquet is firmly attached. Place a dab of hot glue on the seam of the wristband using a hot glue gun. This will help to hold the bouquet in place. You may want to hold the flowers into place while dabbing the hot glue so that you know exactly where the glue should go and avoid burns. Do not hot glue the flowers when the corsage is on a wrist! This can cause burns! Trim the ends. Make sure the stem is trimmed as needed so that the wire doesn\u2019t poke into the wearer\u2019s wrist. Slip the elastic wristband and corsage over the wearer\u2019s hand. It should rest securely around her wrist. It should be loose enough to be comfortable but tight enough to not fall off.",
