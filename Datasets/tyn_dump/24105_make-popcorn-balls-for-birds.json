Then carefully pour 1/4 cup (56 g) of unpopped popcorn kernels into the pot and cover it with a lid. Wait for approximately 30 seconds, until you can hear the popcorn popping! When the popping sound slows down to 2-3 seconds between each pop, take the lid off the pot and remove the pot from the heat. This makes approximately 8 cups of popped popcorn. Don't add salt, butter, or any other toppings to the popcorn."

For example, use a wild bird seed mix if you want to feed wild birds in your backyard. Alternatively, use a species-specific type of bird seed if you want to feed your pet bird.
