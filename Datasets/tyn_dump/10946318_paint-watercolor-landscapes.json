If you want bolder color, dip the brush back into the puddle of paint as you apply the wash. If you used the liquid masking fluid, you can paint directly over the objects in the foreground. For a greater depth of color, mix a few different colors for your base wash. For example, to make a wintery sky, combine blue, red, and yellow to create a cool gray."

Some artists prefer to lay in lighter washes before applying darker washes, but others choose to paint the darker washes to prevent the colors from becoming muddy. Experiment to find which style you like best. For example, make a greenish-brown color and use it to make a wash that will become a mountain range.

To create a richer atmosphere, apply a darker color to the base of the treeline. If you don't want to paint a treeline in your landscape, consider blurring the existing sky with the middle ground.
