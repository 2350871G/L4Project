The exact amounts of vinegar to baking soda don\u2019t matter as much as the consistency. It should have a paste-like consistency. Start by pouring some white distilled vinegar into a bucket or bowl and then slowly add baking soda. The mixture will foam up, so add the baking soda slowly so you it doesn't overflow.
