You can use a 50/50 mixture of 2 different colors to achieve a specific shade or add a few drops of 1 color to another to adjust the shade slightly. Mix the paint colors together well using a spoon or fork. For example, you could use 1 tablespoon (15 mL) each of blue and white to create a pastel or light blue shade. Or, add a few drops of green to 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of white paint for a light mint green paint. If you don\u2019t want to adjust the shade of your paint before coloring the inside of the mason jar, pour it directly into the jar."
