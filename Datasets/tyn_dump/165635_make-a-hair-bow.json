Choose a solid color that matches your favorite outfit or go for a funky pattern that will make a statement. Consider the following options when you pick out your fabric:\nSturdy fabrics like cotton, linen or denim will make your bow stiff and well-shaped. Stretchy or limp fabrics will create a floppy bow. Choose a fabric with a texture that will create the look you want. Large designs won't be completely visible once the fabric has been turned into a bow. Small polka dots, stripes, and other tiny patterns will show up well."
