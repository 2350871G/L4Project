Once you\u2019ve finished cleaning the leaves, set them aside on a dry paper towel or cutting board. You can also place the collard greens in a colander to rinse them. However, make sure that both sides of the leaves get cleaned off if you do this. Did you know? Boiling (otherwise known as blanching) your collard greens helps to halt the enzymes that would lead to the leaves browning, fading, and spoiling. While boiling is an optional step, it\u2019s highly recommended for people looking to store their greens for a long time.
