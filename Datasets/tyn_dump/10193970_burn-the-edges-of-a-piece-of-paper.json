Once it\u2019s lit, move the tip of the lighter under the paper so the flame is barely touching the paper. Keep it there to darken the paper and safely burn it without the sheet catching on fire. You can use a small lighter, but it won\u2019t give you as much control over the flame. Use caution with an open flame and ask a parent for help if you\u2019re younger."
