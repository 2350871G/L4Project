        "Firmly scrub out the wheel well completely.",
        "Because the buildup on wheel wells is usually stubborn, this part of the car is designed to be sturdy and resilient.",
        "Scrub the wheel well vigorously.",
        "Keep your brushes separate.",
        "Do not use your stiff well brush on your wheels, nor should you use your soft wheel brush on the wells.",
        "Keep the wheel wet while brushing it.",
        "The presence of water will help prevent scratches and a spotted finish.",
        "Rinse the wheel thoroughly.",
        "Use your hose or power washer to completely clean soap from all areas of the wheel.",
        "Start with the wheel well, as this area will likely splash grime on your wheel while rinsing.",
        "Pay close attention to spokes and lug nuts.",
        "Flush soap from lug nut holes.",
        "Dry the cleaned wheels with a microfiber cloth.",
        "Allowing your wheels to air dry will likely result in spots.",
        "To protect the finish of your wheels, only use a soft microfiber cloth.",
        "Keep wheel-drying cloths separate from others to prevent corrosive brake dust from harming more delicate parts of your car.",
        "After you\u2019ve finished cleaning all your car wheels, wash your wheel drying cloths separately from other laundry or car cleaning items.",
        "Use cleaning clay to remove embedded particles when necessary.",
        "No matter how many times you scrub your wheel with cleaner, embedded particles will likely remain.",
        "Use cleaning clay after you\u2019ve cleaned the wheel but before it has been polished or waxed.",
        "Though brands may vary, generally, to apply the clay:\nSpray your wheel with a clay lubricant.",
        "This may have come with your clay, or it may need to be bought separately.",
        "Shape about a quarter of the clay into a patty with your fingers.",
        "With moderate-light pressure, rub the clay over the wheel\u2019s surfaces.",
        "Take care to apply the clay to difficult to reach places and black spots.",
        "Fold the clay as it becomes dirty so that you continue to remove embedded particles with clean parts of the clay.",
        "Use clay lubricant and a clean, soft microfiber cloth to wipe away clay when the entire wheel has been cleaned.",
        "Polishing Aluminum Wheels Polish coated wheels lightly.",
        "Coated aluminum wheels should not have much (or any) oxidation or pitting.",
        "Only use a clear coat safe polish, like Meguiars Ultimate Polish, on clean, dry, clear coated aluminum.",

        "Chad is based in the Los Angeles, California area and uses his passion for auto detailing to teach others how to do so as he grows his company nationwide.",
        "Chad Zani\t\t\tAuto Detailing Expert\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: Instead of going for the strongest polish you can find, start with a lighter polish.",
        "You never want to do a fast fix with a heavy chemical to save time.",
        "Always start with the lightest compound and see if that does the job.",
        "If it doesn't, work your way up through the stronger polishes until the wheels look how you want.",
        "Remove heavy oxidation before polishing bare aluminum.",
        "When your wheels are heavily oxidized, you\u2019ll need to use an aluminum polish pre-cleaner.",
        "Spray on the cleaner and allow it to sit for about 10 minutes.",
        "Brush oxidized areas where necessary.",
        "Rinse and dry the wheel well before moving on.",
        "Buff out severe pitting and oxidation by hand.",
        "Wet the metal of the wheel with water.",
        "With your coarsest (lowest grit rating) sandpaper, buff the wheel.",
        "Rinse the wheel regularly and keep it wet throughout this process.",
        "As pitting diminishes, switch to a finer grit (higher rating) paper.",
        "When the pitting is all but gone, finish with your finest grit paper.",
        "Depending on the amount of pitting or oxidation on your rims, you may need to replace your sandpaper several times while sanding.",
        "Severe pitting may require coarser sandpaper, like one that is 320-grit.",
        "A power polisher will buff wheels more efficiently and quickly.",
        "If you have a power polisher, save yourself time and effort by skipping this step and administering wheel polish instead.",
        "Administer aluminum wheel polish to the clean, dry wheel.",
        "Use an applicator, a soft, clean microfiber cloth, or a power polisher wool polishing pad to apply the polish to the wheel.",
        "Apply enough polisher for the entire wheel, or the amount directed in the instructions.",
        "Use a power polisher, if available.",
        "Activate the polisher on a slow setting and spread the polish across the wheel\u2019s surface.",
        "After the polish is well spread, little by little increase the polisher\u2019s speed until it reaches 3000 RPM.",
        "While polishing, keep the pad moving across the wheel.",
        "When the polish begins to dry or disappear, wipe the wheel surface with a clean microfiber towel.",
        "This process can also be done by hand.",
        "Buff polish onto wheels with a polishing pad.",
        "Polishing by hand may require considerable time and effort.",
        "Some polishes may have multiple stages, like those that have a general polish and a finishing polish.",
        "Apply secondary agents in the same fashion as normal polish, but use a clean pad.",
        "Wipe away remaining polisher with a clean microfiber cloth.",
        "At this stage, your wheel should be looking like new.",
        "If, however, you aren\u2019t yet happy with the condition of your wheel, repeat the polishing process.",
        "After each time polishing, wipe the wheel with a clean, soft microfiber cloth.",
        "For multi-stage polishes that use a fine or finishing polish, only re-polish the wheel with the finishing polish.",
        "If you plan on re-polishing, be sure to use new pads and cloths.",
        "Dirty or gritty polish can re transfer to your wheel or cause scratches.",
        "Clean and polish the remaining wheels in this fashion.",
        "Now that your wheel is cleaned and polished, repeat this process on your remaining wheels.",
        "To prevent further oxidation, apply a wheel wax to the wheel according to its label directions.",
        "Wheel wax can be bought at most auto and hardware stores, as well in the automotive section of many general retailers.",
        "An application of wax will prevent dirt and break dust from building up."
