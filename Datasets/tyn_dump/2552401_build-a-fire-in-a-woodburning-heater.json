One method is to use a starter block (StarterLogg is one brand \u2014 break off a quarter of a stick) or a commercial wax log (such as Duraflame or Pine Mountain). These will light and stay lit, creating some warmth inside the woodburning heater and helping the draft start upwards, and they burn with little smoke:\nClose the damper. This will stop the air from coming down and pushing the air into your living area. Most woodburning stoves, in addition to a damper, have a vent that restricts the air entering into the woodburning heater, so you can use this instead of the damper to control the air flow. Put the block on the back of the fireplace shovel, light it and place it up inside the woodburning heater, near the flue opening. What you are trying to do is to heat the upper part of the heater. When you have heated it (you will need to use trial and error to determine how long this process is), slowly open the damper and with luck and skill you will find that the heat and fire from your little block will force the air up the chimney. When the draft has fully reversed (you will hear the air sucking the fire and heat from the starter block), you can safely light your fire."

        "Stay out of the way and let it go \u2014 sometimes if the chimney isn't tall enough, this is the only way to get the draft running well and keep smoke out of the room.",
        "The rest of the room should stay warm - it's just the draft path that will be a little chilly.",
        "Add larger logs.",
        "If you're trying to enjoy an evening, you can make sure the fire will go a while without tending by building it properly to start with.",
        "Once the fire is going well, you should begin to see some red, glowing embers beneath the fire.",
        "As the smaller wood catches and the fire burns hot, grab a larger piece of wood.",
        "Put that on top of the fire carefully, being as certain as possible that the stack is not leaning side to side any direction.",
        "The bigger wood takes a while to catch fire, but once it does, it will burn a long time without you having to get up and stir it or move it around.",
        "The glowing embers will keep things hot, and you should be nice and toasty for a couple of hours this way.",
        "Stir the wood down at least half an hour before you want it to go out.",
        "Break it up with your poker and try to spread it out as much as you can over the area of the firebox.",
        "The thinner it's spread, the quicker it will burn up and go out.",
        "Check after the fire is out to insure that the coals and embers are all dead.",
        "If so, close the damper so that you do not lose valuable home heat through the chimney all day long.",
        "Starting a Fire without a Grate Put two large logs \u2014 the bigger the better \u2014 in parallel about 15 inches (38cm) apart.",
        "Make sure they're perpendicular to the pane of the closed doors, or fire box opening.",
        "These large logs will be the bed of the fire and contain the embers to feed it.",
        "Place one cross-bar across the two large logs.",
        "This log should be about the diameter of your forearm, and it should rest parallel to the pane of the glass door or fireplace opening, closer to the opening of the firebox.",
        "This cross-bar will hold the other firewood and keep an air vent open where the fire can draw fresh air to feed it from underneath.",
        "Crumple newspapers (not glossy paper) on the bottom of the fireplace.",
        "Alternatively, use other tinder like dried twigs or wood shavings as a base.",
        "Place some kindling on top of the newspaper.",
        "Do not put any larger logs or fuel on top yet.",
        "If you can stack the kindling in a grid fashion, leaving plenty of space in between for air to pass through.",
        "Light the fire from the newspaper or tinder.",
        "Make sure that the kindle starts to burn \u2014 you'll want to hear crackling noises.",
        "Place some logs in between the large logs on top of the cross-bar.",
        "Again, these logs should be about half the diameter of your forearm, resting parallel with the cross-bar.",
        "Keep this arrangement at all times: two logs, one cross-bar on top and firewood held by the cross-bar.",
        "Finished."
