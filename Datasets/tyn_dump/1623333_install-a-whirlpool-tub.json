        "Make sure that the new tile will cover the joint from the drywall you are about to remove.",
        "Remove the old tile from the walls with a utility knife and pry bar.",
        "Once you\u2019ve plumbed and marked the tile for removal, you\u2019re ready to start removing it.",
        "Use a utility knife to cut through the drywall behind the tile.",
        "If you use a saw, you are more likely to hit wiring or plumbing.",
        "Then use a pry bar to pull out the tile in large sections or piece by piece.",
        "If necessary, you can use a hammer to make a hole in the tile to get you started at the top.",
        "Wear safety glasses while you are removing the tile.",
        "Wiring and Framing the Tub Contact a registered electrician to do the necessary wiring.",
        "In order for your whirlpool tub to meet your city or county standards, the electrical components should be installed by a registered electrician.",
        "Speak to someone at your local building department and ask for a recommendation.",
        "Then contact the electrician and find a 3\u2013hour window in which they can come to your home and do the wiring.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a registered electrician install the wiring for you, the building department may deny your permit.",
        "Install a 2 in \u00d7 4 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 10.2 cm) backer between 2 studs.",
        "This backer is technically part of the wooden frame that you\u2019ll build to house the whirlpool tub.",
        "Cut a 2 in \u00d7 4 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 10.2 cm) piece of wood 16 inches (41 cm) long so it\u2019ll fit between 2 studs.",
        "Install the backer on the side of the frame that the tub\u2019s faucet will be on.",
        "Before situating the backer in your wall, check the dimensions recommended in the whirlpool-installation instructions.",
        "If recommended, install a tub spout and shower head backers.",
        "Install 2 in \u00d7 4 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 10.2 cm) edge supports to frame the tub.",
        "Measure to the top of the whirlpool tub (under the tub\u2019s edge) and attach 2x4 beams to the wall at this height.",
        "This will be the frame in which you\u2019ll set your whirlpool tub.",
        "Since the tub won\u2019t butt up against the wall on all 4 sides, you\u2019ll need to connect free-standing frame sides to the framing attached to the wall.",
        "Follow the manufacturer\u2019s directions to accomplish this.",
        "Depending on the location of your tub and the number of walls it borders, you may need to erect freestanding frame on 1, 2, or 3 sides of the tub.",
        "When calculating the dimensions of the frame, be sure to measure the dimensions of the tub (not including the upper tub edge) so the tub fits snugly inside the frame.",
        "Installing the Tub Apply mortar below the tub.",
        "Use a trowel to spread a 1 inch (2.5 cm) layer of the mortar to the base of the frame where you\u2019ll set the tub.",
        "Smooth the mortar with a trowel so that it\u2019s in an even layer beneath the tub.",
        "The mortar will help absorb some of the floor\u2019s vibrations and keep the tub seated firmly in place.",
        "You can purchase mortar at a local hardware store.",
        "If you\u2019d like to use a lighter adhesive than regular cement, try using fiber-based cement.",
        "Set the tub in place on top of the mortar.",
        "With at least 1 other person helping you, lift the whirlpool up and over the frame you\u2019ve constructed.",
        "Center the tub in the frame (over the mortar) and lower the tub into place.",
        "The whirlpool tub\u2019s weight will pull it down into the mortar.",
        "Avoid putting any additional weight in the tub until the mortar has had 8-10 hours to fully dry.",
        "Seat the tub\u2019s drain in the drain pipe with a layer of plumber\u2019s putty.",
        "Roll some plumber\u2019s putty into a 3 in (7.6 cm) rope with a diameter of about \u20442 in (1.3 cm).",
        "Place the putty on the base of the drain and then insert the drain through the drain hole.",
        "Use a tub drain wrench to hold the drain in place, and be certain the putty squeezes out on all sides of the edge of the drain.",
        "Tighten the waste line until the rubber seal is snug while holding the drain in place.",
        "The plumber\u2019s putty will keep water from leaking through the drain, and should also prevent the drain from shifting around.",
        "Assemble the copper pipes and solder them together.",
        "Connect the new tub to the existing plumbing hookups by connecting them with copper fittings.",
        "Once the pipes and fittings are in place, solder the copper piping together.",
        "Wait to solder the tub spout until after you have put in the tub.",
        "Be sure to closely follow the directions in the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.",
        "If you stuffed a rag in the trap hole before, remove it before connecting the new plumbing.",
        "If you are soldering onto the valve, be certain to take off the cartridge beforehand.",
        "Check to make certain that the P trap will reach the new drain.",
        "If it needs to be extended, extend it at this time.",
        "Install the waste-and-overflow unit to complete the plumbing setup.",
        "Slip the waste-and-overflow unit into the whirlpool tub\u2019s drain trap.",
        "Once the unit is in place, connect it to the drain.",
        "Tighten all nuts by hand and then give them a quarter turn with slip joint pliers.",
        "At this point, also go ahead and plug in the whirlpool\u2019s electrical plug to a GFCI outlet.",
        "Your new whirlpool tub should have come with copper waste-and-overflow unit.",
        "If it didn\u2019t, purchase one at a hardware store.",
        "To ensure it fits your tub, also purchase a copper extension.",
        "Turn on the water and check for any leaks in the tub or plumbing.",
        "Connect the whirlpool tub\u2019s faucet handles.",
        "Then, open the water shutoffs and then turn on the faucets.",
        "Fill the tub until it reaches the overflow and starts to drain through it and check to make sure that the overflow doesn\u2019t leak.",
        "While the water is running, check all joints and seals for moisture.",
        "If there is any moistness, re-tighten the slip nuts and check joints for broken washers.",
        "Start the jets running.",
        "With the jets running, check for leaks again.",
        "Secure the tub rim in place using wafer-head screws or roofing nails.",
        "This process should be clearly described in the manufacturer\u2019s directions.",
        "Either roofing nails or wafer-head screws will slip through pre-drilled holes in the rim of the tub and pass into the wooden frame below.",
        "Tighten wafer-head screws 1 by 1 until they\u2019re as tight as you can get them.",
        "If you\u2019re driving the nails in with a hammer, be careful that you don\u2019t accidentally hit and shatter the rim of the tub."
