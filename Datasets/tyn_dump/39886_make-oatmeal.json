        "Just stir in as much or as little as of each ingredient as you'd like and enjoy!",
        "Give packaged instant oatmeal a taste before adding anything else.",

        "Cooking Rolled or Steel-Cut Oats on the Stove Fill a shallow pot with 1 cup (240 ml) of water or milk.",
        "Use a standardized measuring cup to make sure you have just the right amount of liquid.",
        "Oats simmered in water will cook faster and retain more of their original firmness.",
        "Preparing your oatmeal with milk will lend it more of a soft, smooth texture.",
        "A smaller pot, like a saucepan, will provide the best results, since the oats need to be partially submerged in order to cook.",
        "Only steel-cut or rolled oats should be prepared on the stovetop.",
        "Other varieties, like packaged instant oatmeal and quick-cooking oats, are designed to be cooked in the microwave.",
        "Bring the water or milk to a low boil.",
        "Heat the pot over medium-high heat until it just begin to bubble.",
        "This is the optimal temperature for simmering oats.",
        "It\u2019s important to boil the water or milk before you add the oats so that they don\u2019t absorb too much moisture and become soggy.",
        "You can also use a combination of milk and water for creamier oatmeal without an excessive amount of calories.",
        "Be careful not to let the water or milk get too hot, or it will evaporate quickly and cause the oatmeal to scorch.",
        "Add \u00bd cup (45 gm) of oats and stir.",

        "\u00bd cup (45 g) of oats is considered a standard serving for one person.",

        "Exact cook times will vary depending on the amount and type of oats you\u2019re preparing.",
        "Rather than watching the clock, keep a close eye on the oatmeal as it thickens.",
        "It may take anywhere from 8-10 minutes to simmer a pot of old fashioned rolled oats.",
        "Because of their tougher texture, steel-cut oats may require as long as 20 minutes to soften up.",
        "Over stirring oats breaks down their starches, causing them to turn gluey and neutralizing much of their natural flavor.",
        "Remove the oatmeal from the heat.",
        "Once the oatmeal has taken on your preferred texture, transfer it to a deep serving bowl.",
        "Using a spoon or spatula to scrape the sides of the pot will spare you some added cleanup later on.",
        "And, of course, make sure the bowl you're using is large enough to hold whatever other toppings you plan on incorporating.",
        "Keep in mind that the oatmeal will continue to thicken a little as it cools, so it may be a good idea to take it off the stovetop a tad before it looks just right.",

        "It's hard to go wrong!",
        "Spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice can offer a good counterbalance to sweeter ingredients.",

        "Making Oatmeal with Boiling Water Bring a kettle of water to a boil.",
        "Fill a tea kettle with fresh water and place it on the stovetop over high heat.",
        "An electric tea kettle will also work just fine.",
        "While the water is warming up, you can go ahead and get the other components of your breakfast ready.",
        "This method can be used to prepare packaged instant oatmeal as well as the slower-cooking steel-cut and rolled varieties.",
        "Pour \u00bd cup (45 g) of oats into a bowl.",
        "This will make enough oatmeal for a single person.",
        "For larger servings, portion out another \u00bd cup (45 g) of oats at a time.",
        "You\u2019ll need to add \u00bd-1 cup (120-240 ml) of boiling water for every \u00bd cup (45 g) of oats you\u2019re preparing.",

        "For softer oats, use about 1\u00bc cups (300 ml) of water.",
        "If you prefer your oatmeal nice and thick, stop at \u00be-1 cup (180-240 ml).",
        "The oats will puff up and thicken as they cook, which means it\u2019s usually better to use a little more water than you think you need.",
        "Let the oatmeal cool prior to eating.",
        "After pouring in the boiling water, the oatmeal will be scalding hot for several minutes.",
        "To avoid burning your mouth, hold off on taking a bite until most of the steam has dissipated.",
        "You\u2019ll be glad you did once you get that first taste!",
        "A splash of cream or a dollop of Greek yogurt will help fresh-cooked oats cool off quicker.",

        "However, any deep, open container will work.",
        "Once the oats are inside, give them a shake to level them.",
        "Rolled oats work best for making overnight oatmeal\u2014instant oats will quickly become mushy once liquid is added, while steel-cut oats won\u2019t soften enough, and will remain dry and tough.",
        "If your mornings tend to be pretty frenzied, mix up your overnight oatmeal in a plastic storage container so you can savor it on the go.",
        "Add an equal portion of milk or non-dairy milk substitute.",
        "Pour in about \u00bd cup (120 ml) of cold milk, or use almond, coconut, or soy milk instead.",
        "This will provide the moisture for the oatmeal.",
        "You\u2019re aiming for approximately a 1:1 ratio of oats to milk.",
        "It may take a couple trial runs before you get the proportions exactly right.",
        "If your overnight oatmeal turns out a little soggy the first time, cut back on the amount of milk you use on your next attempt.",
        "If they\u2019re overly dry, add an extra splash just before serving.",
        "Stir the contents of the container thoroughly.",
        "Keep stirring until the texture of the oats is consistent from top to bottom.",
        "Otherwise, you\u2019ll end up with unappetizing dry patches.",

        "Refrigerate the oats overnight.",
        "Cover the container and place it on the center shelf of your refrigerator.",
        "As the oatmeal sits, it will slowly absorb the milk and become plump and tender.",

        "For the smoothest possible texture, leave it for 7-8 hours.",
        "If the container you\u2019ve selected doesn\u2019t come with a built-in lid, secure a piece of plastic wrap or aluminum foil around the opening.",
        "Refrigerating overnight oats for longer than abut 10 hours may result in a soggy, inedible mess.",
        "Top with your favorite flavors and enjoy cold.",
        "After the oatmeal comes out of the fridge, fill the container the rest of the way with tasty toppings like honey, Greek yogurt, or chocolate-hazelnut spread.",
        "Health-conscious eaters can turn to more nourishing offerings like fresh fruit and unsweetened nut butters instead.",
        "Try using mashed bananas to supply sweetness rather than traditional sweeteners.",
        "Get creative!",
        "There\u2019s virtually no limit to the number of unique flavor combinations you can come up with.",
