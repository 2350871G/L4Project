        "Store the rhizome in a plastic bag filled with peat moss, and keep the bag in a cool, moist place, such as a basement.",
        "If your pond is at least 18 inches (46 cm) deep and doesn\u2019t completely freeze, you can winterize your hardy lilies outside.",
        "Place the pot in the deepest part of the pond, where it'll be protected from cold air.",
        "Divide an overgrown lily every 2 to 3 years.",
        "Eventually, the rhizome will start to crowd the pot, and you\u2019ll need to divide it.",
        "In the spring, remove the rhizome, or root ball, from the pot and rinse away excess soil from the roots.",
        "Look for tuber-like shoots with distinct growing tips or emerging stems.",
        "Using a knife or pruning shears, cut the shoots and surrounding roots in lengths of at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the rest of the root ball.",
        "You\u2019ll likely be able to divide the root ball into several shoots.",
        "Plant each shoot in a separate container, then place them in your pond or give them to a friend."
