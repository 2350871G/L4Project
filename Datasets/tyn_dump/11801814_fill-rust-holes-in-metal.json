Layer several fiberglass patches, for instance, to level out a deep hole and make the repair stronger. Mix body filler with a paint stick on a scrap piece of cardboard. Use the stick to scoop a golf ball-sized dollop of the body filler out onto the cardboard. Open the separate harder and spread 5 to 8 drops of it across the body filler. Then, stir the body filler until it\u2019s well-mixed. It will turn a uniform color, usually green, although it varies depending on the color of the body filler and hardener.If you\u2019re using a fiberglass patch, mix a fiberglass resin and hardener together. The mixing process is the same as it is with body filler, so nothing changes! The filler and hardener typically come packaged together in a kit. If you\u2019re buying them separately, make sure you have both products. Insert the metal patch behind the hole. Reach underneath the metal if you\u2019re able to, or push the patch through the hole. Then, spread the patch out so it\u2019s flat against the remaining metal. The patch should completely cover the hole. Keep it stuck in place by spreading a little bit of the body filler around its edges.Getting the patch in place can be tricky. Try spreading some filler around inside the hole with a paint stirrer. Alternatively, you might be able to pin the patch in place with magnets. If you can\u2019t get a patch to stick, consider using an epoxy filler instead. Epoxy filler is like a putty, so all you have to do is spread it flat on a piece of fiberglass mesh glued over the hole. It\u2019s a simpler way to repair a hole, but it doesn\u2019t last as long as a patch. Cover the patch with a coating of body filler. Most kits come with a plastic applicator you can use to spread the filler. If you don\u2019t have one, use a paint stick. Apply enough of the filler so it\u2019s about \u20444 in (0.64 cm) higher than the surrounding metal.You can sand down the filler later so it\u2019s even with the surrounding metal and ready for repainting. If it doesn\u2019t look great now, no worries. It doesn\u2019t have to. Wait about 1 hour for the filler to completely dry. Body filler dries quickly, so you won\u2019t have to wait long. Be sure to check the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for the precise drying time. Once the filler is hard to the touch, you can begin blending it in with the old metal.The patch dries out faster when it\u2019s in an area with good air circulation. During cold or humid days, expect it to dry out a little slower than normal. Once the initial layer dries, you can apply more filler if it is needed to level out the surface or even finish filling in an oddly-shaped area. Sand the patch with 80-grit sandpaper before each coating. Sand the patch smooth with 180-grit sandpaper. Scrub the entire patch with a light but firm amount of pressure. Sand the entire patch until it\u2019s level and feels smooth to the touch. Use a lighter touch around the edges to blend the patch in well without scratching the metal around it.Wipe off any dust on the patch before painting it. You can use a tack cloth or a microfiber cloth dampened in warm water. Spray on a paint primer and let it dry for 1 hour. To quickly paint over the patch, get a quick-drying spray-on primer designed for metal surfaces. Shake the can, then hold it about 6 in (15 cm) from the patch surface. While spraying the primer, sweep the canister from side to side across the patch. Don\u2019t overlap your strokes as you move from left to right, or else the paint could build up unevenly in certain spots.Painting at the right speed can be a little tough if you have never used spray-on paint or primer before. Practice on a piece of scrap material first, like cardboard. Make sure the primer is completely dry to the touch before painting over it. The patch should also be covered. If it\u2019s still exposed, it could rust, so even it out with a second coat of the primer. Paint over the primer and let it dry for 24 hours. If you\u2019re going for a more professional finish, select a spray-on paint that best matches the color of the existing metal. Hold the canister 6 in (15 cm) from the surface and apply it from left to right across the patch. Make sure the coating is consistent. If it isn\u2019t, let it dry, then apply additional coating as needed to restore the metal back to normal.Doing this is great for hiding damage on a car, but you don\u2019t have to do it for things like unpainted metal gutters. Welding a Hole Shut Trace an outline of the hole on a piece of wax paper. Wax paper is slightly transparent, so it\u2019s a sneaky way to get a good idea of what you need to patch over the hole. Hold the paper flat against the metal, then outline the hole with a permanent marker. Cut out the template with scissors afterward.Make sure the outline is accurate. Cutting it a little bigger than the actual hole is fine. If it doesn't cover the hole, remake it. Use metal-cutting shears to cut a copper backing. Place the template over a copper sheet. Take a permanent marker and draw around the outline. Make the backing the same size as the hole. Then, trim it out and set it aside. Some other tools you can use include tin snips, a hacksaw, or a dremel. Hardware stores generally have everything you need for the repair, including welding material and copper sheets. Check online as well for anything you can\u2019t find in a store. Attach the copper panel to the back of the hole with a clamp. Reach underneath the hole to install the copper panel, if possible. You\u2019re going to need a way to keep it there while you\u2019re welding. Try fitting a clamp around the metal and copper panel to bind them together. If you\u2019re unable to get a clamp in place, use a welder\u2019s magnet instead by placing it on top of the metal.Make sure the copper backing is the same size as the hole. The edges should be accessible, or else you won\u2019t be able to weld them to the existing metal. Put on a welding mask and other gear to protect yourself. Wear a shaded welding mask to protect your eyes against the light from the welding torch. Also, put on heat-resistant welding gloves and an apron. Have a fire extinguisher nearby as well.Work away from flammable surfaces. If you\u2019re fixing sheet metal, place it on a welding table, for instance. Remember to work in a well-ventilated area! Have other people stay out until you\u2019re done. Install a steel wire into the torch of a MIG welder. Since steel won\u2019t stick to wire, it\u2019s perfect for filling in the holes around the copper. Feed it through the tip of the torch, making sure it stays centered. If it feels like it\u2019s stuck, pull it out, clean it, and recenter it. Wipe the wire clean with a dry cloth. If it gets dirty, the weld won\u2019t turn out very strong. For an inexpensive, all-purpose choice, get a AWS ER70S-3 steel wire. Use AWS ER70S-6 steel wires for a higher-quality repair. Connect the welder to its gas tank and exposed metal. Hook the hose adapter to the outlet on top of the gas tank. The hose is on the back of the MIG welder, near where you installed the steel wire. After securing the gas, walk to the front of the machine and take the other black hose there. This one will have a metal clamp at the end. Secure it to a welding table or a bare panel on a car, for exampleShielding gas is used to protect the hot metal so it cools into a strong weld. Try using 100% carbon dioxide for an inexpensive way to complete most projects. A 75% argon, 25% carbon dioxide mix will also work, and is great for welding tough metals like steel. The grounding clamp is for safety. It lets out electricity, especially when something happens that causes the welder to overload. Spot weld every 3 to 4 in (7.6 to 10.2 cm) along the metal. Turn on the welder, then hold the torch at a 90-degree angle to the metal. Bring the tip of the torch right up against the metal. Hold it there for a couple of seconds to place a \u20442 in (1.3 cm) wide spot of melted steel wire. Do this all the way around the perimeter of where the existing metal and copper backing meet.Remember to remove your clamp or magnet after the initial few welds cool. They will hold the metal together while you finish the repair. If the hole is small, you can close it just by spot welding. You won\u2019t need to use a bronze backing. The steel from the torch\u2019s wire will fill in the hole. Add more spot welds to fill in the remaining gaps between the metal. Go back to the first spot you made. Once it is cool, weld another spot next to it. Complete more \u20442 in (1.3 cm) welds next to the original set you made. Repeat this until the entire perimeter is filled.Spot weld next to each of the cooled spots. Position your torch so the spots don't overlap at all. This is called stitch welding since it isn\u2019t one continuous weld. Instead, you will end up with a bunch of metal dots, kind of like US dimes, next to one another. Sand the weld flat with a metal angle grinder or Dremel tool. Try using an angle grinder fit with an abrasive flap wheel, for instance. Wait at least 30 seconds for the weld to finish cooling, then hold the wheel up to each spot. Grind them all down until they\u2019re smooth and roughly level with the surrounding metal.Sanding the weld makes it look much better. It's good if you plan on masking the weld, but you should always do it if you want to paint over it. Prime and paint the metal to give it a more professional look. If you\u2019re planning on covering over the welded spot, apply a compound, such as a body filler. Cover the entire copper backing, along with the weld, using a wood paint stick. After it finishes drying, level it out with 180-grit sandpaper, then spray on a primer. Apply a coat of paint afterward if you wish to match the repair to the existing metal.At the very least, cover the weld and apply a primer to seal out rust. Fresh welds are vulnerable to rust, especially before they have had a chance to cool.",
