                    "description": "To make a homemade stain from natural ingredients, you'll combine the vinegar with a steel wool scouring pad. Any type of vinegar will work, as long as it's been properly distilled. White, balsamic, and apple cider vinegar are just a few of the varieties you have to choose from. Each type of vinegar will produce a slightly different color when it interacts with the steel, and with the wood you're staining. Play around with different combinations until you end up with a tone you like. White vinegar tends to create a rich reddish hue, while balsamic and apple cider vinegar most often result in deep, muted brown or black shades."

A glass jar, large mixing bowl, or plastic bucket could all make good containers, depending on how much all-natural stain you intend to make. If you decide to use a metal container, make sure it's made from nonreactive materials. Otherwise, it may react with the vinegar and throw off the color of the stain."

                    "description": "A good rule of thumb is to use 1 steel wool pad for every 1.5 cups (0.35 L) of vinegar in your container. This will produce enough stain to color small pieces of furniture and accessories. If you're attempting to distress a larger item, multiply the recipe by 2 or 3 to make sure you'll have enough. Pulling the steel wool apart gently will increase its surface area and help it dissolve faster in the vinegar. Be sure to wear a pair of thick work gloves to protect your hands while handling the steel wool. To double the amount of stain, mix up 3 cups (0.71 L) and 2 steel wool pads. To triple it, use 4.5 cups (1.1 L) and 3 pads."

If you're happy with the color of the stain after the first 24 hours, remove the steel wool to keep it from getting any more concentrated. If you want your stain to be even darker, leave the steel wool in the vinegar solution longer. Keep in mind, however, that it will stop changing color after about 2 days."
