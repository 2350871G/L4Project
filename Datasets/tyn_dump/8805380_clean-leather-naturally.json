Any natural oil will work fine and many people like the smell of coconut, olive, or even walnut. The oil will help to hydrate your leather, while the lemon will remove any dirt or grime. Apply the mixture to your leather until it is damp and then buff it with a microfiber cloth. If you are just interested in polishing your leather, then you can apply the oil directly to the leather.

Use this as a leather conditioner, as it will both clean leather products and help to prevent new stains. After applying this over the leather\u2019s surface, feel free to let it air dry. With all of these applications, it is best to use distilled water, as this will prevent you from adding particle residue to the leather\u2019s surface."
