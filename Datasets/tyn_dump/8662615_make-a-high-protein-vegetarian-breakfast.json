Whisk until everything is evenly mixed. Mix your dry ingredients and combine with the wet ones. In a large mixing bowl, stir your buckwheat flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together until they are evenly combined. Pour in the wet ingredients and repeat. Add more milk if desired to thin the batter if it\u2019s too thick for your taste. Fold the egg white into the batter. First, crack the egg over the rim of a small bowl. Separate and discard the yolk before pouring the egg white into the bowl. Whisk the egg white with an electric mixer, then add it to your batter and fold it in. Cook your pancakes in a skillet. Coat the bottom of a skillet with cooking oil or butter. Turn the heat to medium. Once the oil heats up, pour \u00bc cup of batter (59 ml) into the skillet for each pancake.
