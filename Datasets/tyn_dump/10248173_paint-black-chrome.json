Spray an all-purpose metal cleaner onto the surface, and wipe it down with a microfiber cloth. Rinse away any dirt and dry the surface before you apply paint. To remove stubborn residue, use a heavy-duty car cleaner and a soft scrub brush. If you are painting an item such as a car emblem, unscrew it from the car so you can easily clean it."

Rip 4\u20136 in (10\u201315 cm) of tape, and place it anywhere you\u2019d like. For instance, if you are painting the rims of your car, remove the rims from the tires, stretch out a plastic drop cloth, and place the rims on top.
