        "Drying the Negatives Attach a clothespin or clip to the end of the film and pull it off the spiral.",
        "Take the spiral out from the development tank and lightly pull on the end of the strip.",
        "Secure a wooden or plastic clip to the end and use it to gently tug the film.",
        "Your film should easily unravel from the spiral.",
        "There will not be any photographs on the end of the strip so your clip won\u2019t damage any negatives.",
