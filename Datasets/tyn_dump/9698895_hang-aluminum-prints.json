Stand-outs come in two sizes, either Reveal or Flush Cut. Both options come with metal hanging brackets and can be used with all sized prints. Reveal style stand-outs have rounded corners and are \u20448 inch (3.2 mm) smaller than your print. Use if your print has rounded corners. Flush cut stand-outs have sharp, square corners. You can select black edge banding for all sizes. White, silver, or maple edge banding is available for certain sizes.
