Set the turkey in the fridge and wait roughly 20-30 minutes to let it cool down. Once the temperature reaches above 40 \u00b0F (4 \u00b0C), bacteria can begin growing, which is why it's important not to leave the turkey out at room temperature for too long. Keep the turkey covered while it's in the fridge."
