                    "description": "Check the fabric\u2019s label when you purchase it to determine how to wash it. Some types of chiffon are machine washable while others are dry-clean only. If your fabric is machine washable, set the machine on the delicate cycle and tumble dry it on low or without heat. Pre-treating your fabric is an important step to prevent it from shrinking after you wash the finished garment."

                    "description": "Place a piece of tissue paper on a flat surface and smooth it out. Then, pin your chiffon to the tissue paper. If you need to cut large pieces of chiffon, tape multiple pieces of tissue paper together along their edges and lay your fabric over the connected pieces. Layering tissue paper under your chiffon fabric will make it easier to cut and sew.Tip: You can also starch the chiffon instead of using tissue paper to stabilize it. Spray the chiffon all over with heavy starch and then cut and sew it. Wash the garment after it is completed to remove the starch and make the fabric light and airy again."

                    "description": "Lay the paper pattern pieces over the fabric and place paper weights on the edges of the pieces or insert pins along the edges. This will keep the paper pattern pieces from shifting around while you cut the fabric. Paper weights work best if you will be using a rotary cutter to cut your chiffon, while fine pins work best if you will be cutting the chiffon with scissors. If you use pins, select sharp, fine pins and only insert them along the edges of the pattern. Push the pins all the way through the pattern, fabric, and tissue paper. Insert 1 pin about every 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) along the edges of the paper pattern pieces. If you use paper weights, place 3 or more weights on each of the patterns. Position the weights as close to the edges of the pattern as possible. Make sure that your fabric is on a cutting mat before you do this."

Press down on the fabric and tissue paper with a rotary cutter or cut through the fabric and tissue paper with scissors. Go slowly to avoid any jagged edges and cut right along the outer edges. If you have a piece that needs to be cut along a fold, do not fold your fabric! Chiffon is slippery, so it\u2019s likely to move and you may end up with a misshapen piece. Instead, trace half of the pattern onto the fabric, then flip the pattern over and line up the edge with the tracing and trace around the other side. Then, cut along the lines you have drawn to get the full piece."

Then, lift up the edge of a pattern piece wherever there are markings if you want to transfer it to the fabric. Use a piece of chalk or fabric marker to transfer these markings onto the tissue paper behind your fabric or directly onto the fabric. You can also use tailor tacks to indicate pattern markings without damaging your fabric. Stick the tacks onto the fabric wherever you need to indicate a dart or other marking."

Tie off and cut the excess thread just as you did before. Cut the excess fabric about \u20448 in (0.32 cm) from the stitch. Use a sharp pair of fabric scissors to cut along the last stitch you made. Remove as much excess fabric as possible, such as by cutting \u20448 in (0.32 cm) from the stitch. Go slowly to avoid creating any jagged edges. Fold the stitched edge over the raw edge again and sew along it. Next, make another \u20444 in (0.64 cm) fold to enclose the raw edge inside of the fabric. This will hide the raw edge completely. Sew a straight stitch about \u20448 in (0.32 cm) from the folded edge to secure the raw edge inside of the fold.

Cut the excess thread about 6 in (15 cm) from the end of the seam, then tie the ends together in 3 knots. Cut the excess about \u20444 in (0.64 cm) from the last knot just as you did before.",
