Turn the balance wheel toward you, moving it counterclockwise, until it reaches its highest position. Raise the presser foot lifter to lift the presser foot, as well. Remove the bobbin case. Open the shuttle cover to reveal the bobbin case. Pull on the bobbin case latch, pulling the case straight out through the front of the machine. The shuttle cover is located along the front side of the machine, beneath the needle and behind the extension table. Slide the bobbin into the bobbin case.

Insert the thread into the needle. Bring the thread through the front of the eye and out through the back. Once the thread is successfully inserted through the needle, pull out a tail roughly 2 inches (5 cm) long. Position this tail behind the needle, pointing toward the back of the machine. Part Four: Drawing Up the Lower Thread[4]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source Raise the presser foot and needle. If the two are not already in their highest positions, take a moment to make sure that both the presser foot and needle are as high as possible. To raise the presser foot, simply lift up the presser foot lever/lifter. To raise the needle, turn the balance wheel on the right side of the machine counterclockwise, toward yourself, until the needle sits in its highest position. Turn the balance wheel toward you.

        "Lift the spool pin to its vertical position and rest the spool of thread on it.",
        "Position the spool so that the thread appears to wrap around it in a counterclockwise rotation.",
        "Pass the thread through both upper thread guides.",
        "Pull the thread from the spool, drawing it through the rear thread guide at the top of the machine, followed by the front thread guide at the top of the machine.",
        "The rear thread guide is directly next to the bobbin tension disc.",
        "Simply slip the thread into the gap of the guide.",
        "The front thread guide is a small notch directly in front of the rear guide.",
        "Slide the thread through that notch.",
        "Note that there should be a diagram on the top of the machine to help guide you as you thread the needle.",
        "Pull the thread down.",
        "Slip the thread down into the right channel at the front of the machine.",
        "At the bottom of the right channel, wrap the thread around the upper tension control dial.",
        "The thread should pass from right to left, picking up the thread check spring and slipping into the thread tension discs behind the dial.",
        "Grab the thread on both sides of the tension dial.",
        "Gently tug on both sides to make sure that the thread is firmly in place.",
        "Guide the thread up and around the take-up lever.",
        "Draw the thread up through the left channel at the front of your machine.",
        "Bring it all the way to the back of the channel, then slip it into the eyelet of the thread take-up lever peeking out from inside the channel.",
        "Pull the thread through the eyelet, moving from right to left.",
        "After successfully trapping the thread inside the eyelet, draw the thread back down through the left channel again.",
        "Pass the thread behind the thread guide.",
        "Slip the thread down and position it behind the wire thread guide just above the needle.",
        "Thread the needle from front to back.",
        "Insert the thread into the needle.",
        "Bring the thread through the front of the eye and out through the back.",
        "Once the thread is successfully inserted through the needle, pull out a tail roughly 2 inches (5 cm) long.",
        "Position this tail behind the needle, pointing toward the back of the machine.",
        "Part Four: Drawing Up the Lower Thread[4]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source Raise the presser foot and needle.",
        "If the two are not already in their highest positions, take a moment to make sure that both the presser foot and needle are as high as possible.",
        "To raise the presser foot, simply lift up the presser foot lever/lifter.",
        "To raise the needle, turn the balance wheel on the right side of the machine counterclockwise, toward yourself, until the needle sits in its highest position.",
        "Turn the balance wheel toward you.",
        "Turn the balance wheel toward yourself again in a full rotation.",
        "The needle should move all the way down and all the way back up.",
        "Hold the tail of the upper thread as you do this.",
        "Keep the thread taut, but do not put pressure on the needle.",
        "Note that needle must be threaded and the bobbin must be loaded during this process.",
        "During this rotation, the upper thread should catch the lower bobbin thread in a loop.",
        "Pull the upper thread toward you.",
        "Gently tug on the thread inserted through your needle.",
        "Continue tugging until the thread looped around it pops up enough for you to grab it.",
        "This extra loop of thread comes from the bobbin.",
        "Once you can grab the loop, pull it out into a straight tail.",
        "If you cannot grab it with your fingers, use a small screwdriver, pencil, or similar object to draw the loop out.",
        "Position both tails behind the machine.",
        "Pull on both pieces of thread until you have tails measuring roughly 6 inches (15 cm) long.",
        "Let both of these tails hang off from the back of the sewing machine.",
        "Make sure that the upper thread passes in between the \"toes\" of the presser foot.",
        "With the completion of this step, the Brother LS 2125i sewing machine is fully threaded and ready to use."
