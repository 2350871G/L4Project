Generally, there is a flat metal area behind each front wheel and in front of each back wheel.Which Wheel to Access: Depending on what type of vehicle you have, there may be an ABS sensor in each wheel\u2014check your owner\u2019s manual for verification. If you have access to an ABS scanner, it can tell you which sensor is faulty. If you don\u2019t have a scanner, you\u2019ll need to systematically clean each sensor until the ABS light turns off."
