The container you go with should have a solid one-piece lid or cap that screws on and stays put.Tip: If your jar has a stubborn label on it, you may be able to soak it off with a little dish soap and white vinegar in warm water. Mason jars are a good place to start if you have older children that you trust to handle glass. Clear plastic containers are safer and better choices for younger children. Check your recycling for an empty plastic peanut butter jar, a sturdy water bottle, or a plastic juice or soda bottle. Many crafters recommend Voss or SmartWater bottles for their large size and smooth, sturdy construction."
