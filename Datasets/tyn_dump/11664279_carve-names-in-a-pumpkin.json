        "Remove the piece of paper when you\u2019re finished.If you still have trouble seeing the dotted outline, trace around it with a dry-erase marker.",
        "You may also sprinkle baby powder on the pumpkin skin, and it will fill in the holes so they\u2019re easier to see.",
        "Avoid poking completely through the pumpkin skin since you could weaken the pumpkin.",
        "Carving the Letters Out Cut around the outlines with a serrated carving tool.",
        "Use a small serrated tool from a pumpkin carving kit so it\u2019s easier to stab into the skin.",
        "If the letter has a gap or space in the middle, such as the letters A, B, D, O, P, Q, or R, remove that section first.",
        "Then go around your outline of each letter, making long straight cuts as often as possible since they\u2019re easier to cut.",
        "Work slowly so you don\u2019t accidentally break off pieces of the pumpkin skin that you want to keep on.It\u2019s okay to cut out sections of letters at a time.",
        "For example, if you\u2019re cutting out the letter T, try cutting the top horizontal line first before cutting out the vertical part.",
        "Always cut away from your body so you don\u2019t hurt yourself in case the knife slips.",
        "Secure the center cutouts from any letters into the gaps with toothpicks.",
        "Only use the small middle cutouts from the letters A, B, D, O, P, Q, or R, so you don\u2019t block all of the light coming through the cutout.",
        "Slide a toothpick into the middle of the cut out on the thickest side.",
        "Place the cutout section in the gap where you carved the letter and stab the toothpick into the pumpkin skin to secure it in place.",
        "Try to position the cutout section so it looks like the letter on the printed design of your name.",
        "For example, if you have the letter O in your name, put the circular cutout from the middle of the letter so it\u2019s in the center of the carved letter.",
        "For another example, the letter A will have a triangular cutout that you can stick near the top of the carved hole in the pumpkin.",
        "You don\u2019t have to place the cutout section back in the carved out letters, but it may be more difficult to read at a glance.",
        "Light will still shine around the small cutout section.",
        "Rub petroleum jelly around the exposed skin to prevent rot.",
        "Coat the tip of your finger with a bead of petroleum jelly and apply it on any of the cut edges on the pumpkin skin.",
        "Make sure it has a thin, even coat so the pumpkin retains moisture and preserves the carving longer.",
        "Then rub petroleum jelly on the inside walls of the pumpkin for an additional layer of protection.If you don\u2019t use petroleum jelly, the pumpkin may turn brown and shrivel, making it harder to read your name.",
        "Put a tealight inside of the pumpkin to light it up.",
        "Set the tealight candle on the bottom of the pumpkin and use a utility lighter to light the wick.",
        "Place the back piece you cut off from the beginning back over the hole to keep the light contained so it makes your name look brighter.",
        "Don\u2019t forget to blow out the tealight after each time you light it so you don\u2019t create a fire hazard.Display your pumpkin indoors or outdoors to give your home a festive look.Variation: If you don\u2019t want to use a candle with a real flame, look for a solar- or battery-powered light to put inside the pumpkin instead.",
        "Etching Names in the Pumpkin Skin Scrape \u20444 in (0.64 cm) of the skin off with a linoleum block cutter.",
        "Set the blade of the block cutter on the edge of the letter\u2019s outline and push it away from your body so it digs into the pumpkin skin.",
        "Push the cutter in a straight line following the outlines for your name.",
        "Throw away the scrap pieces of skin as you remove them from the pumpkin.",
        "Avoid punching completely through the pumpkin while you\u2019re etching the skin.",
        "Continue carving all of the outer skin until you\u2019re able to read your name.Linoleum block cutters have U-shaped blades that make it easy to carve material, and you can buy them from your local craft or hardware store.",
        "The inner skin of the pumpkin will look lighter than the outer skin, so it will be easy to see where you have and haven\u2019t already carved.",
        "Keep your hands behind the cutter blade at all times so you don\u2019t injure yourself if the tool slips.",
        "Cut \u20444 in (0.64 cm) deeper into the skin if you want more light to shine through.",
        "While light will shine through the lighter interior skin, go over areas where you want highlights in your name with the cutter again.",
        "Keep the skin in some areas of your design thicker so you have spots that are darker than others.",
        "Be careful not to break through to the inside of the pumpkin, or else a bright spot will appear in your name when you light it up.You don\u2019t need to add highlights or carve any more skin from the pumpkin if you don\u2019t want to.",
        "Put a light inside your pumpkin while you\u2019re working to see which areas of your name look brighter than others.",
        "Try using a Dremel rotary tool to remove the skin quickly.",
        "Use the rounded ball tip for the rotary tool and turn it on to the slowest speed.",
        "Lightly press the rotating tip against the pumpkin skin and guide it around the outlines of your letters.",
        "Press deeper into the skin if you want to add highlights to your name, but be careful not to break through to the inside of the pumpkin.",
        "When you\u2019re finished, turn off the tool and wipe the tip clean with a rag.Dremel rotary tools have a small rotating head that\u2019s usually used to carve wood, but it will easier slice through pumpkin skin.",
        "Look for Dremel tools at your local hardware or craft store.",
        "Dremel tools work great for cutting around curves that may be difficult to maneuver around with the linoleum cutter.Warning: Never touch the tip of a rotary tool while it\u2019s spinning since it can cause serious injuries.",
        "Spray a lemon juice solution on the exposed skin to help preserve it.",
        "Combine equal parts of lemon juice and cold water in a spray bottle and thoroughly mix them.",
        "Apply the spray to the etched letters wherever you cut through the outer skin.",
        "Then spray the inside of the pumpkin as well to prevent it from rotting as quickly.You can also apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly if you don\u2019t have any lemon juice.",
        "Set a tealight in the pumpkin if you want the design illuminated.",
        "Set the tealight on the bottom of the pumpkin and light the flame.",
        "Position the back piece you cut off earlier over the hole to help make your name look brighter on the front.",
        "Display the pumpkin inside or outside of your home.If the light doesn\u2019t shine through the etched letters, use your cutter to remove more of the skin.",
        "Use a battery-powered light if you don\u2019t want to have an open flame.",
        "You don\u2019t need to use a light with an etched name since it will still be easy to read without one."
