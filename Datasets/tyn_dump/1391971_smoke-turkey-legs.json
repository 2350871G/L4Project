Wet brine in a saltwater solution or dry brine by sprinkling salt directly on the legs. To wet brine, dissolve \u20444 cup (180 mL) of kosher salt in 16 cups (3,800 mL) of hot water. For additional flavor, you can also add sweet or acidic ingredients, such as lemon, onion, garlic cloves, rosemary, Worcestershire sauce, and white or brown sugar. Immerse the turkey legs in the brine once it's totally cool. Refrigerate the turkey legs in the brine for a minimum of 8 hours, but no longer than 24 hours. To dry brine, sprinkle 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of kosher salt for every 5 pounds (2.3 kg) of turkey over the meat. Cover the turkey legs loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 12 hours, and no more than 3 days. Uncover the turkey legs in the last 8 hours of dry brining to make the skin crispier."
