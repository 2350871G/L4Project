It is slightly corrosive, so wash the surface thoroughly with tap water as soon as the stain has disappeared. If your stain is particularly hard to remove, lay a rag soaked with hydrogen peroxide over the stain. Let it set for 1-2 hours. Then, remove the rag and proceed with scrubbing the stain. Before you use this technique to clean a stain in a visible area, try it out in an inconspicuous spot to make sure it won't damage your tiles. Hydrogen peroxide is particularly effective for cleaning coffee stains, nail polish, and blood stains on ceramic or finished tile. Hydrogen peroxide is a bleach-like chemical, so before you use any other cleaning sprays or solutions in the kitchen, wipe down the tiles thoroughly with water to remove any remnants."
