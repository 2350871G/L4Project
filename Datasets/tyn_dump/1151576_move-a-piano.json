        "Moving a Grand Piano Know your piano.",
        "A grand piano is long and low, which improves its sound over an upright but also causes it to take up a lot more floor space.",
        "For this reason, grand pianos are rarely seen in private homes.",
        "Grand pianos, like uprights, are divided by size into \u201cpetite\u201d grand pianos, which can weigh as little as 500 pounds, on to standard grands, and finally \u201cconcert\u201d grand pianos, the largest pianos of all, which can weigh as much as 1300 pounds and measure more than 9 feet (2.7 m) across.",
        "However, moving a grand piano of any size requires the same basic steps.",
        "Plan your route.",
        "As always, clearing the way and taking measurements are the first steps to a successful grand piano move.",
        "Because of the grand piano's bulk, it is generally moved on-end, so double check that any doors you plan to move your piano through are tall enough to accommodate its front-to-back length, with several inches to spare.",
        "If the piano is too deep to fit through a door with several inches of clearance to spare, professional help will be required.",
        "Prepare the piano.",
        "This is where moving a grand piano becomes much more complicated than moving an upright.",
        "The safest way to move a grand piano (and the way that professional movers do it) is to load it onto a rolling skid board, which is basically a load-bearing board on wheels.",
        "With as many people as possible on hand to assist you, lift the bass corner of the piano and unscrew or otherwise remove the leg there.",
        "Gently set the piano down and secure the removed leg in blankets; then, with the help of your crew, blanket and tape the body and remaining legs of the piano itself.",
        "Equipment rental shops should be able to rent you a skid board if you don't own one.",
        "Be sure that the top of the piano is securely locked down, as well as the keyboard cover.",
        "Move the piano.",
        "Carefully lift the piano from the back end upward, while simultaneously lifting the keyboard end off the ground as evenly as possible.",
        "Once the piano is balanced on the skid board, it can be moved by slowly pushing it from the rear end while pulling from the front end.",
        "Extra helpers should stand on either side of the piano to help keep it upright in case of bumps and wobbles.",
        "The goal is to set the piano vertically on the skid board with the left side (bass side) down on the board, so that the treble side of the piano points skyward and the keyboard is vertical.",
        "Remember that the piano gets heavier toward the bass end, which means the center of balance is likely to be closer to that end than the other.",
        "Multistory Piano Moving Tips Get professional help.",
        "By far the safest and surest way to move a piano up or down flights of stairs is by hiring professional piano movers.",
        "A piano's large size, incredible weight, and unclear center of gravity make it a dangerous item to move through vertical space for those who are not experts.",
        "Use whatever equipment you can get.",
        "Visit an equipment rental store and talk to a knowledgeable clerk there about the size and weight of your piano to help decide what setup will be best for your move.",
        "A piano dolly or furniture dolly with straps can help make a move up a flight of stairs much easier.",
        "Specially designed piano skids are also a sensible option.",
        "Learn about the staircase.",
        "Find out whatever information you can about its age, design, and composition.",
        "In some cases, a staircase may not be able to properly support a 700-pound piano and four or five grown movers all at once, in which case the move should be aborted.",
        "It is better to know ahead of time than risk causing severe property damage and possible injury.",
        "Support the low end.",
        "If, for whatever reason, you decide not to get professional assistance moving your piano up or down a building, remember that the downward-pointing end of the piano will carry even more of the piano's overall weight on a staircase than it does on flat ground.",
        "The majority of people helping you move the piano should be at the lower 50% of the piano at all times to help keep it stable.",
        "However, nobody should stand directly behind the piano without plenty of room to step aside, since one slip from another crew member could mean being crushed underneath its weight.",
        "Ensure that everyone can easily step to the side if control over the piano is lost.",
        "Move slowly.",
        "Even more so than during a flat move, taking regular breaks to readjust and catch your breath is vital during a staircase piano move.",
        "Plan to stop at each new step, gently set the piano down, reset your grip, and lift for the next step.",
        "By being slow and methodical, you will ensure a solid grip from beginning to end and minimize the risk of injury.",
        "Beware of landings.",
        "At each landing, even on skids or a special piano dolly, it is possible that the piano will have to be turned on-end or otherwise manipulated in order to turn the corner.",
        "A few strong and well-balanced people can make the turn.",
        "Just be sure that everyone has as much room as possible and is planted firmly on both feet."
