Multiply the reference drawing\u2019s dimensions to blow them up to the size of the wall. The template grid and the wall grid need to be at a 1 to 1 ratio, having an equal number of lines spaced a proportionate distance apart. For example, if the wall is 10 ft \u00d7 10 ft (3.0 m \u00d7 3.0 m), break the paper down into a 1 in \u00d7 1 in (2.5 cm \u00d7 2.5 cm) squares. Every 1 in (2.5 cm) on the paper equals 1 ft (30 cm) of wall space. For instance, your reference image is 5 in \u00d7 7 in (13 cm \u00d7 18 cm). Your wall is 10 in \u00d7 14 in (25 cm \u00d7 36 cm). If you multiply the dimensions by 2, making each grid on the wall 2 in \u00d7 2 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 5.1 cm), you can easily transfer your design."

For example, if you\u2019re painting a tree, use a large brush, roller, or sprayer for the trunk and limbs. Switch to a smaller brush for tiny branches and twigs.

As a rule of thumb, wait at least a week. Some artists like to wait as long as 6 weeks to ensure the paint seals correctly. The amount of time you need to wait varies depending on the paint you use and other factors. Thick coatings of paint take longer to dry out. Cold or damp environments also cause paint to dry more slowly. Oil-based paints can take 6 months to a year to dry completely.

Using a varnish protects the paint from debris and damage. Always use an acrylic varnish for outdoor murals. Make sure the varnish is removable.

Pre-Sketching Your Design Draw your mural design on a piece of paper before painting it. Plan your mural design by making a basic mock-up.

If you are unable to measure a big wall, ask the property owner for a blueprint or other documents containing the measurements. You may need to estimate the wall\u2019s dimensions. Create a grid over the design you drew on paper. Using a pencil and ruler, make a series of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines. Measure your template paper as needed to figure out its size and space the grid lines evenly. As a general rule of thumb, space the grid lines 1 in (2.5 cm) apart, since grids of this size work for just about any mural. Factor in the size of the wall when making the grid. For larger, more complex murals, divide up the sketch with more frequent grid lines. Each grid box contains a small part of your image that you will transfer to the finished mural later. Draw a grid on the mural wall in chalk. Do a little math in order to transfer the grid properly from your paper to the wall. Multiply the reference drawing\u2019s dimensions to blow them up to the size of the wall. The template grid and the wall grid need to be at a 1 to 1 ratio, having an equal number of lines spaced a proportionate distance apart. For example, if the wall is 10 ft \u00d7 10 ft (3.0 m \u00d7 3.0 m), break the paper down into a 1 in \u00d7 1 in (2.5 cm \u00d7 2.5 cm) squares. Every 1 in (2.5 cm) on the paper equals 1 ft (30 cm) of wall space. For instance, your reference image is 5 in \u00d7 7 in (13 cm \u00d7 18 cm). Your wall is 10 in \u00d7 14 in (25 cm \u00d7 36 cm). If you multiply the dimensions by 2, making each grid on the wall 2 in \u00d7 2 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 5.1 cm), you can easily transfer your design. Transferring and Finalizing Your Design Outline your mural\u2019s main features in pencil on the wall. Choose a quality woodworking pencil, then place details like trees, clouds, and characters on the wall. Follow the grid system to transfer your design to the wall.

Basic outdoor wall paint with an eggshell finish is a great choice for most projects. Oil-based alkyd enamel or polyurethane enamel paints are also an option. Oil-based paints produce richer, darker colors, but tend to yellow as they age. Choose latex paints for an inexpensive way to cover indoor wall space.

Quality acrylic and latex house paints dry within about an hour. The drying time varies depending on the paint you have, so consult the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations if possible. Weather affects the time it takes for paint to dry. Set aside extra time for the paint to dry in cold or humid environments. Some oil paints require as long as 24 hours to cure before you are able to touch them up. Paint in the remaining details with different brush sizes. Get a few different brushes to tackle all of the detail work your design calls for. Any brush you use to paint on paper or canvas will work. Synthetic brushes are usually a good choice if you need something that will last a while. Save the largest brush for coloring open spaces and the smallest brush for the most intricate details. For example, if you\u2019re painting a tree, use a large brush, roller, or sprayer for the trunk and limbs. Switch to a smaller brush for tiny branches and twigs. Remember to wait at least 30 minutes for the previous paint layer to dry or else the colors will blend together. Add outlines, shadows, and other details with black paint. Choose an appropriate paintbrush, usually the smallest one. These details are usually fine, so they are tough to add on a large scale without mistakes. If you do make a mistake, wipe up the paint carefully with soap and water or paint over it again when it dries. For example, if you drew characters in your mural, adding outlines distinguishes them from the background colors. Completing and Sealing the Mural Clean up your work by painting over mistakes. Step back and take a look at your work. You will probably notice a few spots where the colors didn\u2019t blend well, the paint ran, or some other issue. Most mistakes are pretty simple to fix. Let the mural dry, then go over the damaged spots with another layer of paint. Mix new paint as needed to match the color you need to fix. Mixing an exact match is very difficult. Blend the new paint in with the old as much as possible. Wait about a week for the paint to dry completely. Paint feels dry to the touch within 24 hours or less, but that doesn\u2019t mean its ready for varnishing. Moisture may still be underneath the top layer. As a rule of thumb, wait at least a week. Some artists like to wait as long as 6 weeks to ensure the paint seals correctly. The amount of time you need to wait varies depending on the paint you use and other factors. Thick coatings of paint take longer to dry out. Cold or damp environments also cause paint to dry more slowly. Oil-based paints can take 6 months to a year to dry completely. If the paint feels dry to the touch after about 1 week, put a layer of varnish on it. Cover it with a final varnish after the paint finishes curing. Seal the mural with a clear varnish to protect it. Choose a clear, water-based, non-yellowing paint varnish. Matte or even satin varnishes work best since glossy varnishes look a little too shiny on murals. Mix the varnish with water to turn in into a paint. Then, use a wide paintbrush to coat the entire mural. Add a second coating after the varnish dries within a day to finish your mural. Using a varnish protects the paint from debris and damage. Always use an acrylic varnish for outdoor murals. Make sure the varnish is removable. If it is, you can scrub it off when you need to touch up the paint underneath it.",
