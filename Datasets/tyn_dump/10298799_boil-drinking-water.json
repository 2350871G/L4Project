Then, secure a clean cloth over a jar or another container with a rubber band. Pour the water onto the cloth, letting it drip through and into the container. When you've poured all the water through, remove the cloth carefully to avoid reintroducing sediment to the water. You can also use a paper towel or coffee filter if you don\u2019t have a clean cloth available."

Bubbles should rapidly rise from the bottom of the pot without pause. If you\u2019re familiar with cooking techniques, this is called a rolling boil. The water should bubble consistently before you set your timer. The water can take a while to bubble, especially if you\u2019re heating large quantities. Expect it to take at least 5 or 10 minutes and reach a temperature of at least 212 \u00b0F (100 \u00b0C).
