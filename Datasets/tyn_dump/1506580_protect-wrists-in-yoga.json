Slowly lower your hands so that your wrists are fully extended and you feel a stretch in both of them. Hold this stretch for 15 to 30 seconds and repeat it several times. You can also do light stretches in which you rotate your wrists in a circle or each individual wrist back and forth toward your forearm and then back. Stretching helps your wrist muscles fully extend while under the pressure of your weight. If the wrist muscles are not stretched out, full extension cannot be achieved and injury is more likely."

Your weight should rest mostly on the pads at the base of your fingers rather than the heel of your hand or your fingertips. Spreading out the pressure across your hands will reduce the strain on your wrists but it will not take all of the pressure off of them.

Having your fingers spread out will give you more stability as you move through the pose. This will reduce the amount of work your wrists need to do to keep you steady and will protect them. You do not need to spread your fingers out beyond what is comfortable. You simply need to keep them wide for stability."

Your palms should be facing in towards each other. Do a variety of weight-bearing poses, such as cobra or upward facing dog, on your fists to keep your wrists neutral instead of extending your wrist muscles by being on your palms. You can either fold your thumbs into your fist or keep them out, whichever is most comfortable for you.Tip: If you find this position difficult, try doing it for just a few of the weight-bearing poses you do at first. Taking the stress off of your wrist muscles for just a pose or two will help reduce the overall stress on your wrist muscles."
