Before you begin, you want to consider what you are trying to achieve and set your goals. Your reasons for pruning will influence when you prune as well. You can do light pruning or remove dead wood at any time, but if you have larger goals, you'll want to plan your pruning around the seasons. For instance, pruning in the winter will result in an explosion of growth during the spring. Pruning during the summer will slow the growth of the cut branch, so it's a good strategy if you're trying to shape your tree or slow the growth of branches you don't want."
