Bake until lightly browned, shaking the pan gently every few minutes to spread the heat more evenly. This typically takes eight to fifteen minutes, depending on how thick the layer of sesame seeds is. Use a baking sheet with deep sides to avoid spilling. Sesame seeds can burn very quickly if the heat gets too high. Stay in the kitchen and don't forget to check frequently."

Hulled seeds have had this removed, and are always very white, almost translucent, and shiny. You can toast either type of seed, but the unhulled seeds are crunchier and have a slightly different flavor. Seeds with hulls contain more calcium but may be more difficult to digest, unless you plan to grind them, so the nutritional value is comparable. While you can soak unhulled seeds overnight, then remove the hulls by hand, the process is labor-intensive and rarely done at home. Both varieties should be available in Asian grocery stores, and often in Western stores as well."
