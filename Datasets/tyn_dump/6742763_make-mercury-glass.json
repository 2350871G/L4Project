    "text": " Using Mirror-Finish Spray Paint Get a can of mirror-finish spray paint. You can buy this paint from a craft store. It is different from silver spray paint in that it has a reflective, mirror-like finish. Some brands call it \"looking glass spray.\" Clean your glass item with glass cleaner and a lint-free cloth. A vase or mason jar would work the best, but you can use other items too, like a glass lamp shade. Spray the item with glass cleaner, then wipe it down with a lint-free cloth. Be sure to clean both the inside and outside of the item. Mask off the side of the item that you won't be painting. If you plan on painting the inside of the item, cover the outside with masking tape. If you will be painting the outside of the item, then stuff the item with newspaper. Painting the inside will give you a nicer finish, but you won't be able to use it as a vase. Painting the outside will leave some texture, but you'll be able to use it as a vase.

Apply a light coat of mirror-finish paint in a well-ventilated area. Go outside or into a well-ventilated room. Shake the can of spray paint, then hold it 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 cm) away from the glass item. Apply a light, even coat of spray paint using a sweeping, side-to-side motion.

If you painted the outside of the vase or jar, you can fill it with water and use it as a vase for fresh flowers. Using Acrylic Craft Paint Wash and dry a glass vase or jar. Wash the glass with warm, soapy water, then rinse it off. Dry the glass with a towel. To help the paint stick better, it would be a good idea to wipe the glass down with rubbing alcohol too, although that is not absolutely necessary. Fill a spray bottle with equal parts of water and vinegar. Fill the bottle halfway with water, and the rest of the way with white vinegar. Close the bottle, then shake it to combine the solution. Choose a spray bottle that has a mist option; don't use a bottle that squirts water out like a water gun. Pat silver acrylic craft paint onto the glass with an old toothbrush. Pour some of your paint onto a disposable tray or palette. Dip the brush into the paint, then tap it on a paper towel to get the excess off.
