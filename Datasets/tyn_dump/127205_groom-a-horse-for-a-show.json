Continue to do this until you\u2019ve run the comb over the entire body and hindquarters of the horse. You can purchase a curry comb online or at an equestrian supply store. Do not run the curry comb over the horse\u2019s tail, mane, face, or legs. Run a hard bristled brush over the horse\u2019s body and legs. A hard bristled brush, or dandy brush, will remove the dirt from your horse\u2019s body. Start in the front of the horse and work your way towards the rear. Start by brushing down the horse\u2019s neck and body in short, swift strokes towards the grain of the hair. Repeat this across the entire body, rear end, and legs of the horse. Do not use a hard bristled brush on the horse\u2019s face because it could irritate it. Spray horse conditioner in the horse\u2019s rear, legs, and haunches. A horse conditioner will soften your horse\u2019s coat and give it a shiny luster. You can buy spray-conditioners online or at an equestrian supply store. Hold the bottle of conditioner 6 in (15 cm) away from the horse and spray the conditioner on the haunches, or front shoulders, legs, and rear. Do not spray the conditioner on top of the horse where the saddle goes or it will become too slippery. Don\u2019t spray the horse\u2019s face because you can get the conditioner in the horse\u2019s eyes. Do not spray horse conditioner on the horse\u2019s mane or it will become to slippery for your saddle. Use a soft brush to brush the entire horse. A soft bristled brush has softer bristles that won\u2019t irritate your horse\u2019s face. Start on the face of the horse then work your way down its neck and shoulders. Continue to run the brush over the horse\u2019s body in small strokes to remove finer pieces of dirt and dust. Comb out any knots in your horse\u2019s tail with a wide-toothed comb. Hold the hair away from the base of the tail with one hand and comb out the knots with the other hand. This will prevent you from ripping out the hair from the root and hurting your horse. Comb out the sections closest to the roots and work your way down the tail. Continue combing the tail with the comb until there aren\u2019t any knots in it. You can spray some conditioner in the horse\u2019s tail to make it easier to comb. Comb the mane to one side. Use a wide-toothed comb to pull the mane to one side of the horse. Work out the knots with and pull the mane so that it stays to one side. As you pull the mane, loose hairs will fall out. The mane may give you resistance before it is trained and stays in place, but continue working at it until it sticks. You may have to pull somewhat hard to get some of the knots out. Adding the Finishing Touches Rub baby oil on the horse\u2019s muzzle and ears. Pour a couple of drops of baby oil into a rag. Take the rag and rub the outside of the horse\u2019s ears and on the side and front of the horse\u2019s nose or muzzle. Get the ears and muzzle saturated with the oil until they are shiny. This will make the horse's groomed face stand out more. Clean the horse\u2019s hooves with a hoof pick. Purchase a horse hoof pick online or at a horse accessory store. Stand on the side of the horse so that it doesn't hurt you if it bucks. Use one hand to control the horse\u2019s hoof and use the other hand to hold the pick. Lift your horse\u2019s leg and use the pick to dig out the dirt in the grooves on the bottom of the hoof so that the \"U\" indentation on the bottom of the hoof is clearly visible and doesn't have any more dirt in it. Repeat this process on all of your horse\u2019s hooves. You should clean out your horse\u2019s hooves every time you ride it or it could cause it discomfort. Polish the horse\u2019s hooves. Purchase a black hoof polish online or at a horse accessory store. Lay down a piece of cardboard or sheet so you don\u2019t get polish on the ground. Dab a rag or brush in the polish to saturate it. Then, run the brush or rag in a straight line around the top edge of the hoof where the hoof and leg meet. Fill in the rest of the hoof so it has a solid black color. When you're done, let the hooves dry off for a few minutes so that the polish doesn't rub off. Braid your horse\u2019s mane for a unique look. Make sure to read the rules of the competition you\u2019re entering to make sure that braiding your horse\u2019s mane is allowed. To braid their mane, tie it into small, 1 in (2.5 cm) ponytails and use an elastic bands to secure them. Separate each ponytail into 3 parts and wrap the side parts around the middle part to make a simple braid. You can also use more complex braids like a French or Dutch braid to really wow the judges. You can dampen the mane if you\u2019re having trouble putting it into braids.",
