For the best results, pick the largest one you can that fits into your budget and allocated space (choose a location that\u2019s away from doors, windows, and heating units). A 48 in (120 cm), 120 US gal (450 L) tank is a great choice for beginners. Buy a tank stand rather than relying on a piece of furniture you already have. A 10 US gal (38 L) tank could easily weigh over 1,000 pounds (450 kg) once it\u2019s full of water, creatures, and rocks. Aquarium stands are specifically built to hold that volume, whereas your normal table or TV stand isn\u2019t meant to withhold that much weight. Most tank stands are designed to also house the tank\u2019s equipment, so it provides storage as well as a base for the tank."

After the gravel is rinsed, spread it out evenly over the bottom of the tank. Substrate is sandy, and it\u2019s a better material for fish that like to burrow. If you\u2019re planning on buying fish that burrow, get substrate. Otherwise, gravel should be just fine! Rinsing the gravel beforehand will get rid of excess dust, which will put less strain on the filtration system. Adding or not adding gravel is a personal preference.

        "If there are other decorative pieces you want to add to your tank, now is the time to do so.",
        "Take your time placing the live rock in your tank and try out different arrangements to see which you like best.",
        "Before you add any living creatures to the tank is the best time to move the live rock around.",
        "Don\u2019t turn on the aquarium lights just yet.",
        "You can leave them off until you add the first fish or invertebrates to the tank.",
        "Look for live rock that has been \u201ccured.\u201d This means that toxic compounds have already been removed from the rock.",
        "Fill the tank the rest of the way with saltwater and test it again.",
        "Depending on how much live rock you added to the tank, there may still be a gap of space between the water and the top of the lid.",
        "If so, add more saltwater until it reaches the top of the tank.",
        "Test the salinity of the water and make adjustments until it returns to the 1.025 level.",
        "At this stage, it\u2019s okay if the salt level is a little off.",
        "The tank has to cycle for several weeks before you add your first fish, so there is time to make any adjustments that need to be done.",
        "Cycle the water and clean the filter for 4 to 6 weeks.",
        "During this time, clean out the filter daily\u2014once it is no longer dirty on a daily basis, you can slow the filter cleaning to every other day or twice a week.",
        "You can also do a water change on a weekly basis, which is where you will remove 1/2 of the water from the tank and replace it with fresh saltwater.",
        "Don\u2019t add any fish or other creatures to the tank during this cycling phase.",
        "Check the ammonia and nitrate levels every week until they reach 0.",
        "Most experts recommend purchasing a test kit to measure these levels.",
        "It can take anywhere from 4 to 6 weeks for the nitrate and ammonia in the water to start reacting and reach the appropriate level.",
        "Once the levels reach 0, you can move on to the process of adding live creatures to your tank.",
        "Too much ammonia can kill off living creatures within hours.",
        "Nitrogen is what helps convert ammonia into a compound that won\u2019t harm the fish.",
        "Ammonia should be undetectable by a testing kit.",
        "If it is registering, chances are the tank needs to cycle more, or perhaps the filter is clogged.",
        "EXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDoug Ludemann\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProfessional Aquarist\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDoug Ludemann is the owner and operator of Fish Geeks, LLC, an aquarium services company based in Minneapolis, Minnesota.",
        "Doug has worked in the aquarium and fish-care industry for over 20 years, including having worked as a professional aquarist for the Minnesota Zoo and Shedd Aquarium in Chicago.",
        "He received his Bachelor of Science in Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior from the University of Minnesota.",
        "Doug Ludemann\t\t\tProfessional Aquarist\t\t\t\tConsider adding bio pellets to your tank to help keep your tank balanced.",
        "Bio pellets are a carbon source that nourishes the bacteria in your tank.",
        "That bacteria naturally consumes the phosphorous and nitrogen in the water, so they can help keep the levels where they need to be.",
        "However, if you're using GFO in your tank, you can get the phosphate down to a point where the bacteria can't thrive, so they basically cancel each other out.",
        "Introducing Live Fish and Creatures to the Tank Put algae-eating creatures into the tank first.",
        "Scavengers, like snails and hermit crabs, are the best creatures to add to your tank before adding anything else.",
        "They are very hardy and will do some extra cleaning work for you.",
        "Add 1 algae eater for every 10 gallons (38 L) of water in your tank.",
        "Check out the nassarius snail, tailspot blenny, trochus snail, kole tang, and emerald crab, or ask the experts at your local aquatics store for a recommendation.",
        "Wait at least 2 weeks between each new addition to your tank.",
        "After adding the algae eaters, let the tank cycle for at least 2 weeks before adding anything else.",
        "Continue testing the ammonia and nitrate levels, and clean out the filter on a weekly basis.",
        "This gives the creatures and the tank time to adjust and filter properly.",
        "If you were to add all the fish you want at once, they may go into shock, or the tank may not be able to adjust quickly enough to support them.",
        "Add healthy fish and invertebrates to the tank over time.",
        "Put 2 to 3 new specimens into your tank every 2 weeks until your tank is as full as you\u2019d like it to be.",
        "This gives the biological filtration system time to adjust between each new addition and makes it more likely that your fish will stay healthy.",
        "If a tank already has dead or dying fish in it, do not purchase a fish from it.",
        "Research each fish before adding them to your tank.",
        "Check the water level, temperature, and equipment on a daily basis.",
        "The best way to keep your tank running efficiently and your fish happy and healthy is to perform a cursory check of the entire tank every day.",
        "This doesn\u2019t have to be time-consuming\u2014add water if the level is low, clean out a filter if it\u2019s full, and make sure your fish look healthy.",
        "You can also check the ammonia and nitrate levels on a weekly basis to make sure they\u2019re appropriate.",
        "Make your aquarium check part of your daily routine so you don\u2019t forget about it."
