Alternatively count the beats in 10 seconds and multiply by six, or 15 seconds and multiply by four. To measure your pulse at the wrist, place one hand palm up. With the other hand, place the tips of your index, middle and ring fingers below the base of your thumb until you feel the pulse. Alternatively, if you have a stethoscope, you can evaluate your resting heart rate with it.

Muscle strengthening activities should work all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms).
