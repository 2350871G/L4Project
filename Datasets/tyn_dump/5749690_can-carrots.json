        "Generally, you'll need to leave your jars in the canner for about 10 minutes, leaving the weight off but the lid on.",
        "At this point, the jars will likely be quite hot.",
        "You may need to use a pair of tongs or an oven mitt to move your jars from where they are to the pressure canner.",
        "Add the weight to your pressure canner.",
        "For most pressure canners, after 10 minutes have passed, you'll need to close all openings until the pressure gauge reaches 10.",
        "For most pressure canners, you'll want to maintain this level of pressure for about 25 minutes.",
        "Set a timer on your phone or use a kitchen timer so you don't forget about your carrots and end up with a big mess.",
        "Turn off the heat to let the jars cool down.",
        "Depending on factors like your altitude, climate, and equipment, this could take anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour.",
        "Before opening your canner but after it has cooled, open the pressure valves and wait until the valve gauge reaches 0.",
        "Remove the jars and let them cool overnight.",
        "Residual heat can remain in your jars for quite some time.",
        "Allow the jars to cool slowly and naturally by leaving them out in a safe place in your kitchen overnight.",
        "Be careful not to leave jars where children or family member might accidentally touch them.",
        "Check the jars for proper sealing.",
        "An improper seal can lead to dangerous bacteria growing in your jars.",
        "You can check the seal by gently poking the top of the jar with your finger and listening for a popping sound.",
        "If you hear this or feel the lid flex under your finger, the jar is improperly sealed.",
        "Improperly sealed jars can be stored in the refrigerator and eaten as you would normally.",
        "You can also repeat the process to reseal the jar, but in many cases, this can result in the carrots becoming overcooked.",
        "Enjoy your canned carrots throughout the year.",
        "Canned vegetables can last for up to two years and can last for 7 to 10 days after opening if you refrigerate them.",
        "You may want to store your carrots in cold storage or your basement so they are easily accessible but out of the way."
