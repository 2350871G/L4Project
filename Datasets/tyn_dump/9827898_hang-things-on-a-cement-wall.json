Line it up to the back of the hook and press down. Some adhesive hooks come with the adhesive already affixed to the back. Skip this step and move on to the next if that\u2019s the case with the adhesive hook you have. Press the adhesive side of the hook to the wall for 30 seconds. Remove the paper lining on the back of the hook, line it up straight, and press the hook firmly onto the wall. Hold for 30 seconds and release. Allow the adhesive to dry 30-60 minutes. Once the adhesive has dried, hang your items from the hook(s). If your item pulls the adhesive hook off the wall even after you\u2019ve waited, check to make sure you\u2019ve used a hook that is appropriate for the weight of your item.

Once you feel that the pin has taken hold in the wall, release your hold on the pin and strike the hammer straight on the pinhead to finish. Loop the wire or hanging hardware of your item onto the hook. Stand back to make sure it is hung straight. Make any adjustments needed and enjoy.
