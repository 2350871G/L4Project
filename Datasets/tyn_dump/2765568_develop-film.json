After 4 minutes, drain the tank. Store the developer in an airtight storage bottle if you want to reuse it later on. Pour the blix into the film tank and let it sit for 6 minutes. Fill the tank and seal the cap. Agitate the solution for 10 seconds. Once every minute, rock the tank back and forth to agitate it again. After 6 minutes have passed, empty the tank. Save the blix in a storage bottle if you want to use it again for more film, but don\u2019t let it mix with the developer. If any of the blix mixes with the developer, it will not work. Rinse the tank and film in warm water. Fill the tank with water heated to 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F)  and agitate the water to clean off any of the chemicals. Empty the water after about 30 seconds. Put your stabilizer in the film tank and soak the film for 1 minute. Fill the tank with the stabilizer and leave the film inside. You do not have to agitate the stabilizer for it to work. After 1 minute, drain the stabilizer from the tank and your film is done. If your chemical kit does not come with a stabilizer, then all you need to do is rinse your film. Drying Your Negatives Attach a clip to the end of your film strip. Remove the film spiral from the tank and gently pull the end of the film strip out. Use a clothespin or a similar clip to hold onto the end of the film. The end of the film strip will not have any exposed photos on it so you don\u2019t have to worry about damaging them. Pull the film off of the spiral slowly and hang the strip off the ground. Hold the clip with one hand and the spiral with the other. Pull slowly on the clip so the film unravels from the spool. Place the clip along a string so the film doesn\u2019t touch the ground or the wall. Don\u2019t let anything touch the negatives. Work in a clean room where wind or dust won\u2019t damage your negatives. Wipe any excess liquid off the film strip with a squeegee or your gloves. Start from the top of the film strip and gently squeeze it between 2 fingers or a squeegee tongs. Work down the entire length of the film so there is no dripping water. Wear clean vinyl or rubber gloves if you\u2019re using your fingers. Attach a weighted clip to the bottom of the film strip. Place another clip on the bottom of the strip so it doesn\u2019t twist or deform while it dries. The clip will also catch any drips that fall off of the film strip. Put a tray on the ground below the film strip if you don\u2019t want water or chemicals falling onto the floor. Let the strip dry for at least 4 hours. Don\u2019t touch your strips for at least 2 hours after you\u2019ve cleaned and hung them to dry. Check how wet the film still is each hour by touching an area without an exposed photo. Once they are dry, they can be stored or scanned. To speed up the drying process, use a hairdryer on the lowest speed and heat setting and hold it 30 centimetres (0.98 ft) from the film strip.",
