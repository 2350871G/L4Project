Adding Doors, Windows, and Built-In Fixtures Measure all the doors and windows. Measure the width of each door and window opening (without frames), and the distance from either side to the corners of the wall the window or door is on. Then, convert these measurements to your chosen scale.Example: A 3\u2019 wide window will be represented by \u00be\u201d wide mark on your floor plan if you\u2019re using a \u00bc\u201d = 1\u2019 scale. Incorporate the walls, windows, and doors into your floor plan. Draw each window as a set of double lines and each door as a single line (i.e., the fully-opened door) with an arc (i.e., the actual swing path of the door). Make sure you place each in the right position along the walls in your scale drawing.Example: If a door\u2019s edges are 6\u2019 from one wall corner and 8\u2019 from the other, the edges should be 1 \u00bd\u201d and 2\u201d from the corners of your scale wall, respectively (at a \u00bc\u201d = 1\u2019 scale). Measure and convert the widths of all built-in fixtures. These include such items as counters and vanities, for example. Convert them to scale, and add them to your plan in the appropriate locations. You can find common architectural symbols for windows, doors, counters, vanities, and other room elements at http://www.the-house-plans-guide.com/blueprint-symbols.html. Making Movable Furniture to Scale Convert the length and width of each piece of room furniture to scale. For instance, a 5\u2019 by 2\u2019 dresser would, at a \u00bc\u201d = 1\u2019 scale, be represented by a 1 \u00bc\u201d by \u00bd\u201d rectangle. Similarly, a 4\u2019 by 4\u2019 table would be a 1\u201d by 1\u201d square. For furniture that isn\u2019t square or rectangular, create the smallest square/rectangle into which the piece would fit and use those measurements. For instance, if a wingback chair is 2\u2019 6\u201d at its widest and 2\u2019 at its deepest, represent it with a \u215d\u201d by \u00bd\u201d rectangle. Then, sketch the general shape of the chair within the rectangle. Draw the furniture on a blank sheet of graph paper. Don\u2019t use graph paper that has the floor plan for the room drawn on it. This way, you can cut out the scale drawing for each piece of furniture and move it around on the floor plan drawing.Tip: Make sure all your sheets of graph paper use the same size blocks\u2014typically .25 in (0.64 cm). If you\u2019re using a scale ruler instead of graph paper, just draw the furniture plans on blank paper to the same scale as the floor plan. Cut out the individual pieces of furniture with scissors. If you want make the cutouts a little more rigid and sturdy, lay each one over card stock or thin cardboard, trace the outline, and cut out a backing board to glue or tape on. If you haven\u2019t already labeled each piece of furniture, jot down the name in the center of the cutout, or use a number to represent each piece--the tall dresser as #1, for instance. Move the cut-out furniture around your floor plan. This can help you to decide on a suitable arrangement for the furniture in the room. And it\u2019s much easier than moving the actual furniture around the actual room!Tip: This is a great idea if you\u2019re buying new furniture for a room, or if you want to freshen up the layout of existing furniture in a room.",

        "If you\u2019re using a scale ruler instead of graph paper, just draw the furniture plans on blank paper to the same scale as the floor plan.",
        "Cut out the individual pieces of furniture with scissors.",
        "If you want make the cutouts a little more rigid and sturdy, lay each one over card stock or thin cardboard, trace the outline, and cut out a backing board to glue or tape on.",
        "If you haven\u2019t already labeled each piece of furniture, jot down the name in the center of the cutout, or use a number to represent each piece--the tall dresser as #1, for instance.",
        "Move the cut-out furniture around your floor plan.",
        "This can help you to decide on a suitable arrangement for the furniture in the room.",
        "And it\u2019s much easier than moving the actual furniture around the actual room!Tip: This is a great idea if you\u2019re buying new furniture for a room, or if you want to freshen up the layout of existing furniture in a room."
