To ensure that the oven is hot enough to bake the cake, set the temperature to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). and allow it to fully preheat. Next, line the bottom of two 8-inch (20-cm) round cake pans with parchment paper and lightly coat them with butter and flour. You can use nonstick cooking spray instead of the butter to grease the parchment paper if you prefer. Cream the butter and sugar together. Add \u00bd cup (113 g) of softened butter and 1 \u00bc cups (250 g) of sugar to a large bowl. Use a handheld electric mixer to beat the two together on medium until the mixture is light and fluffy, which should take 2 to 3 minutes. You can mix the cake batter in a stand mixer if you prefer. You can mix the batter by hand, but it will require more time and effort. Beat in the eggs. Once the butter and sugar are creamed together, add 3 large eggs to the bowl, one at a time. Completely mix each egg in on medium speed before adding the next. If you prefer, you can use egg substitute in place of the eggs. Mix in the vanilla. When the eggs are fully incorporated, add 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of vanilla extract. Blend it in on medium until it\u2019s fully incorporated. Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Add 2 cups (250 g) of all-purpose flour, 2 teaspoons (8 g) of baking powder, and 1 teaspoon (6 g) of salt to a separate large bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until they are fully blended. If you prefer a lighter, more airy cake, you can substitute cake flour for the all-purpose flour. Add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture alternately with the milk. After you\u2019ve combined the dry ingredients, mix them into the butter mixture alternately with 1 cup (237 ml) of milk. Beat the mixture on medium-low after each addition until the batter is fully blended. 2% or whole milk works best for the cake. Baking the Cake Layers Pour the batter into the pans. Once you\u2019ve finished mixing the cake batter, divide it equally between the two prepared pans. Use a rubber spatula to spread the batter evenly throughout the pans.
