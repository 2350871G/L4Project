    "text": " Placing the Wires Soak the cane in a glass of water for 4 to 12 hours. Soaking makes the cane more pliable and will reduce the chances or breaking or cracking when forming the reed. Using the ruler and pencil, measure and mark where the wires will go. The top wire should be 1/8 inch below the ridge of the cane (where the shaping starts). The second wire should be 3/8 inch below the ridge. The third wire will be 3/16 inch from the end of the cane (not the ridge). Use the ruler to carve small grooves where you marked the wire placement. These grooves will give the wire a place to sit for more stability. Fold the cane carefully at its thinnest part (the middle of the cane) until the two ends meet. If it cracks a lot, stop and soak for another 1 or more hours. Use the wire cutter from the needle-nose pliers to cut three 3-inch (7.5cm) strips of the brass wire.  Place one of the wires on the reed with your thumb, leaving about an inch (2.5cm) off the cane.  Wrap the wire around the base of the reed. Wrap so that the ends pass each other on the opposite side of the reed. Use the needle-nose pliers to pinch the two ends together. Twist to tighten the wires about 75 percent of the way. Do not twist too much; the wire could snap. However, do not skimp on the twisting, since insecure wiring will not allow the cane to stay together. Repeat the wiring steps for the bottom wire (skip the middle wire for now). Ensure that the wires are sitting properly in the wire grooves. Remember to squeeze the back of the wires (where they crossed around the reed) so they are completely touching each other. Any gaps can affect the reed's performance. Use the reed knife to score the bottom of the reed, making 1/8 inch deep cuts. Make three or four scores on each side of the cane. Wrap the cotton twine tightly around the reed, covering all the wires, above the ridge, and the below the bottom wire. Be careful when wrapping, since the wires might stab your fingers. Keep the twine evenly bound\u2013\u2013this step prevents cracking. Insert the mandrel in the bottom of the reed. Slowly push into the reed, twisting as you push. Push it in far enough to reach the third line on the mandrel tip. Keeping the mandrel inserted in the reed, use the pliers to squeeze the sides of the reed (down where the wires are, not up top where your mouth would be). This allows the mandrel to ease in to the reed more. Once the mandrel is completely in place, use the pliers to tighten the wires completely. Again, be sure to not over-twist the wires. Remove the tip of mandrel (with the reed still on it). Place into the mandrel tip holder. Leave the reeds on the tip for at least to completely cure. After a Week Wait for at least a week to pass. Then remove the twine from the reed. Use the pliers to carefully untwist and remove the wires from the reed. Take a small sheet of fine sandpaper (about 320-grit) and roll it up into a \"scroll\".  Unfold the cane gently. Use the \"scroll\" of sandpaper to sand the groove the mandrel made. Lightly sand the edges to make the sides flat and even. This will allow them to lay flat once folded back together. Do this to both ends of the cane. Cut another three 3-inch (7.5cm) long strips of brass wire.  Place the reed back on the mandrel and put the top wire on as explained in Part One.  Put the middle wire on as explained in Part One. However, make sure that you start on the opposite side of the top wire (once twisted, the twist should be opposite the top wire). Put on the bottom wire as explained in Part One, opposite of the middle wire.  Cut a length of jewelry thread that is about double your arm length. Once cut, fold the thread in half. Hook the looped end of the folded thread on the bottom wire. Keeping tension on the wire, wrap it around the bottom wire, alternating above and below the wire as you wrap. Wrap below this now \"turban\" shape a few times. Then cross up above the turban and wrap up to the second wire. Tie a few tight knots. Cut off the excess (although, leave about half an inch/1cm). Use the Duco cement (or clear nail polish) to coat and glue the thread in place. Place the reed on the mandrel tip holder and allow it to dry for at least a day. After a day has passed, soak the reeds (while on the mandrel tip) and gently tighten all the wires. Use the wire cutter to cut the bottom wire as close to the thread as possible. Bend the other two wires in so they lay flat against the reed. Use the tip cutters to cut the tip of the reed. Only cut small sections at a time. If too much is cut off, the reed will not be able to play in the desired range. On the cutting block, cut the corners of the reed with the reed knife, to lightly round them.  Use the reamer to shave the inside of the reed until it comfortably fits on the bocal.  Insert the plaque through the top of the reed. Hold the reed with your thumb and the knife with your other. Gently and lightly scrape the reed with short strokes, removing small amounts of fiber at a time.
