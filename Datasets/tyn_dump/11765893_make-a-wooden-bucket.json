You can either purchase your slats from a construction supply store, or cut a larger chunk of wood into individual pieces. To do this, pull out a measuring tape and use a carpentry pencil to mark the lengths off with hash marks. Use a straight edge to add the cutting lines. Turn on your table saw and trim each slat identically to be 12 in (30 cm) too.The dimensions listed in this article will make a bucket with 12 slats that is 12 inches (30 cm) tall and 11 \u20448 inches (29 cm) wide. You can adjust the dimensions as you\u2019d like, but it\u2019s best if you don\u2019t adjust the number of slats. Using an alternative number of slats requires readjusting the angles for gaps between slats, which can be hard to calculate. You\u2019re going to nail a template into the slats to space them out while you construct the bucket. It will be much harder to remove this template if you use hardwood.Warning: You\u2019re going to use a variety of power saws over the course of this project. Always wear gloves, a dust mask, and protective eyewear when operating a power saw. Work in a well-ventilated area and always keep your hands at least 6 inches (15 cm) away from the blade."

        "Miter the slats at a 2-degree angle if you want a cleaner fit.",
        "If you want the gaps between the slats in the bucket to be smaller, take your slats to the miter saw.",
        "Use a 2-degree bevel cut to trim the longer sides of each slat.",
        "This will decrease the size of the gap between each slat and make your bucket look rounder.This won\u2019t make your bucket more functional, but it will make the exterior look smoother.",
        "Assembling and Spacing the Slats Mark 1 in (2.5 cm) from the top and bottom of each slat.",
        "Use a measuring tape to measure off 1 in (2.5 cm) from the top edge of each slat and make a horizontal hash mark.",
        "Repeat this process from the bottom edge of each slat.",
        "If you made a bevel cut on each slat so that they fit more closely together, make these marks along the thinner side of each slat.",
        "You are going to install the template along these hash marks to hold the slats in place while you install the copper ring that goes around the bucket and holds the slats together.",
        "Then, you will remove the template before attaching the slats to the base of the bucket.",
        "Line your slats up in a single row next to one another.",
        "Set each of your slats down on a flat work surface.",
        "Use a spirit level to line the slats up along the top.",
        "Push each of the slats together so that it looks like you have a single rectangular chunk of wood.Double-check your hash marks to make sure that they\u2019re parallel along the top and bottom of the slats.",
        "If they aren\u2019t, now is the perfect time to redraw them.",
        "Create \u20448 in (0.95 cm) of space between each slat with spacers.",
        "Brace the top and right side of the rectangular set of slats with spirit levels or a spare board.",
        "Then, create the gaps between each slat using prefabricated \u20448 in (0.95 cm) spacers.",
        "Slide a spacer in between each set of slats at the top and the bottom, 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) from the hash marks.You can make spacers yourself by cutting a scrap piece of wood into 20 blocks that are \u20448 in (0.95 cm) each.",
        "The gaps must be \u20448 in (0.95 cm) if you\u2019re using the \u20444 by 2 \u20442 in (1.9 by 6.4 cm) boards.",
        "If you are using different slats, divide the width of a single slat by 2 to determine how big the gaps must be.",
        "Nail the templates into the slats using the hash marks as your guide.",
        "Set your first template board gently over the hash marks you made at the top.",
        "Line the board up so that the bottom of the template rests just above the hash marks.",
        "Grab a set of thin nails and a hammer.",
        "Gently nail the template into each slat.",
        "Repeat this process on the bottom set of hash marks you made.Warning: Nail extremely gently.",
        "If you slam each nail through, the template will be hard to remove and you may spread the slats out from the heavy vibration.",
        "The nails should be no longer than \u20442 in (1.3 cm) in length.",
        "The smaller the better!",
        "You have to remove this template after attaching the straps, and the template will be hard to remove if you use long nails.",
        "Recheck each gap between the slats before nailing the template into place to make sure the spacers haven\u2019t moved.",
        "Adding the Copper Straps Flip the slats over and cut 2 copper strips to size.",
        "Purchase 2 flexible copper strips that are at least 40 in (100 cm) long and anywhere from \u20448\u20132 inches (2.2\u20135.1 cm) wide.",
        "Cut the strap to size using a set of tin snips if necessary.",
        "Flip the slats over so the template is on the bottom.Tip: You can find these copper strips in the plumbing aisle at a construction supply store.",
        "You may be able to reclaim some copper off-cuts from a plumber or metalworker if you prefer.",
        "Make sure that you can easily bend the copper before purchasing it.",
        "Reinforced copper plating will not work for this.",
        "Attach the first copper strip to the slats just below the top template.",
        "Grab some nails that are \u20442 in (1.3 cm) in length or shorter.",
        "Set your first copper strip underneath the template at the top.",
        "Use the template on the opposite side of the slats as your guide to line the strip up straight.",
        "Then, drive a nail through the strip over each slat that it covers.You don\u2019t need to worry about the slats moving around while you\u2019re hammering the nails in.",
        "The template will hold the slats in place.",
        "Add another copper strap along the second template at the bottom.",
        "Take a second, identical copper strap and hold it against the template at the bottom of the slats.",
        "Line the edge of the copper strip up with the template on the other side.",
        "Nail this strap into the slats so that both strips are parallel.There should be a little bit of extra space left over on each copper strip if they are at least 40 inches (100 cm) in length.",
        "Remove the templates and carefully extract the leftover nails.",
        "Put on a pair of thick gloves and protective eyewear.",
        "Carefully pull up the first template by ripping it out of the slats.",
        "Use a chisel to get in between the template and the slats if necessary.",
        "Use channel locks or pliers to remove any nails that don\u2019t come out.",
        "Repeat this process on the second template.The thin nail holes won\u2019t readily be visible since they\u2019re sitting on the side that will be the inside of the bucket.",
        "Installing the Base of the Bucket Roll the bucket up into a cylinder and nail the copper ends together.",
        "Set your slats up vertically and gently roll them into a circle with the copper straps on the outside.",
        "Adjust the shape of the slats so that the interior edges of each slat are touching one another.",
        "At the spots where the copper overlaps, add one more nail to secure the strip in a circle around the bucket.",
        "Outline the interior edges of the slats on a sheet of plywood.",
        "Set the rolled-up slats on top of a sheet of plywood.",
        "Grab a carpentry pencil and reach inside of the bucket.",
        "Carefully outline the interior base of the bucket on the plywood.",
        "Aim to mark exactly at the point where the plywood meets the slats to avoid leaving a large gap in your base.",
        "Draw along each slat before removing the body of the bucket and setting it aside.You don\u2019t need to use plywood if you don\u2019t want to, but it\u2019s a good option for the bottom of the bucket since it\u2019s inexpensive and easy to cut.",
        "Cut the outline out with a jigsaw to create the base of the bucket.",
        "Trim around the general shape you outlined to make the board easier to work with.",
        "Set the plywood on saw horses and use a jigsaw to cut one edge to size.",
        "Then, use hand clamps to secure the side you cut to a saw table.",
        "Trim each additional side of your outline off with your jigsaw.Wear protective eyewear, a dust mask, and gloves when operating your jigsaw.",
        "You\u2019re doing this by hand without any guidelines, so be careful when making each cut.",
        "You can use a table saw or miter saw and trim each edge perfectly, but this is really time consuming and the base doesn\u2019t need to be perfect to sit at the bottom of the bucket.",
        "Drive a staple or screw into every other slat near the bottom of the bucket.",
        "Sit your slats up vertically.",
        "On every other slat, along the interior of the bucket, put a hash mark 1 in (2.5 cm) from the bottom edge.",
        "Then, use a staple gun or screwdriver to run a \u20448 in (0.95 cm) carpentry staple or \u20442 in (1.3 cm) wood screw halfway through each hash mark.Warning: Don\u2019t drive your staples all the way into the slats.",
        "The base is going to rest on top of the screws or staples where they stick out of the slats, so they can\u2019t be flush with the wood.",
        "Slide the base through the top of the bucket to let it rest on the staples or screws.",
        "Set your bucket down with the screws or staples at the bottom.",
        "Place the plywood base you cut on top of the bucket and rotate it along the slats at the top until it slides down into the bucket.",
        "The staples or screws will catch the base and hold it at the bottom.You can add a layer of wood glue along the interior rim of the base at the bottom if you want to cover any gaps.",
        "Add a handle using a soft metal rod and pilot bit if you\u2019d like.",
        "You can add a handle if you want an easier way to carry your bucket!",
        "Get a flexible metal rod and a drill.",
        "Drill pilot holes that match the width of the rod on opposite sides of the bucket.",
        "Bend the metal rod to shape by hand or with pliers and slide each end into the pilot holes.For a more secure handle, fill the pilot holes with wood glue before sliding the metal rod into the holes."
