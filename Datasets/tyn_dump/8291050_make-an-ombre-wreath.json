If you are going to be completely covering your wreath with decorations, you can purchase a cheap, foam wreath. If you aren\u2019t planning on creating the ombre effect on every square inch of the wreath, you can purchase a straw, grapevine, or other wreath that doesn\u2019t need to be fully covered."
