            "description": "Silk is commonly sold in 36\", 45\" and 60\" widths. So, if you want a square scarf you would ask the salesperson to cut the same length as the width: 36\" x 36\", 45\" x 45\", 60\" x 60\". Your finished size would be 35 1/2\" by 35 1/2\", etc. If you want a rectangular scarf, you have more choice. Some people think a 72\" length looks best when you wear a suit. Left loose, that length of scarf starts at one hem of a jacket, follows the neckline and then falls to the other hem of the jacket. For variety, tie a long scarf into a big floppy bow or give it a loose, low knot and wear a simple, single color blouse underneath. You can try various lengths, using a measuring tape, to find the one that suits you best or select the scarves you love best and take the measure from them. You have more choice in the width of a scarf, because you can crumple or fold the fabric or even wash the fabric in very hot water to take some of the body out of the fabric so that it hangs gracefully. You can make two rectangular scarves when you purchase a 72\" length of 36\" or 45\". One scarf to keep and one to give to a friend or family member."
