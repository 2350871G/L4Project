        "Use a forward motion like you would if you were using a vacuum cleaner.",
        "As you push the Bissell forward, hold down the trigger located on the handle so that hot soapy water is deposited into the carpet.Tip: Start at the far end of the room and work your way toward the entrance.",
        "That way, you won\u2019t accidentally clean yourself into a corner.",
        "Pull the Bissell back as you release the trigger to re-absorb the water.",
        "After dispensing the water, let go of the trigger on the handle and pull the cleaner back over the area in which you just deposited hot soapy water.",
        "The Bissell\u2019s bristles will clean the carpet as it simultaneously sucks up dirty water.",
        "Continue running the Bissell forward and backward over the same spot until no more dirty water comes up.",
        "Going over the same area multiple times will get the area cleaner and also reduce how long it\u2019ll take to dry.",
        "Use the upholstery tool to clean couches, chairs, and hard-to-reach areas.",
        "Make sure to switch the dial from \u201cfloor cleaning\u201d to \u201ctools\u201d so that the water exits the right compartment.",
        "The attachment also has a trigger that you press to release the water.",
        "Remember to go over the same area several times to suck up as much water and dirt as possible.",
        "Feel free to utilize this option any time your furniture needs a little TLC.",
        "You don\u2019t have to wait until your carpets need to be cleaned!",
        "Let the carpet dry for 2\u20133 hours before you replace the furniture.",
        "The damper the carpet, the longer it\u2019ll take to dry.",
        "Or, if you live in a humid climate, that could also affect the drying time.",
        "Check the carpet by hand to see if it is still wet to the touch.",
        "Put up a baby gate or something similar to keep kids and pets out of the room while it\u2019s drying.",
        "Avoid walking on the carpet or replacing furniture before it\u2019s completely dry.",
        "If you compress wet carpet, it could permanently misshape it.Tip: Use the \u201cExpress Clean Mode\u201d to reduce the drying time to 1 hour.",
        "Troubleshooting Common Problems Check the water tank if the soap isn\u2019t dispensing.",
        "The water tank needs to be filled to the line for it to work properly.",
        "It also needs to be securely in place in the cleaner.",
        "Sometimes hair or debris can get in the way, so remove the tank and wipe down the area where it locks into place.",
        "Reinsert the water tank and turn on the power to see if it will now dispense liquid.",
        "The contents of the water tank and the formula tank will mix as you clean.",
        "The soapy water won\u2019t dispense at all if there is an issue with the water tank.",
        "Sometimes the water tank simply doesn\u2019t have enough left in it to keep cleaning and needs to be refilled.",
        "If this is the case, you\u2019ll probably notice that the dirty-water reservoir is looking pretty full.",
        "Remove the dirty water tank and empty it if it isn\u2019t sucking up water.",
        "If you notice that your cleaner has stopped sucking up water, it\u2019s most likely because the dirty water tank is full.",
        "Or, it could be that the tank wasn\u2019t latched firmly into place.",
        "Double-check both possibilities.",
        "The water tank and the dirty water tank are generally located in the same place.",
        "Most Bissell water tanks have an interior compartment that is for the clean water, and the dirty water gets sucked up into a compartment that surrounds the clean one.",
        "You may also need to clean or wipe off the red filter that is underneath the water tank.",
        "If that is clogged, the dirty water won\u2019t be able to get sucked up into the tank.",
        "Make sure the cleaner is reclined if the brush roll isn\u2019t moving.",
        "If you try to operate the Bissell while it\u2019s in an upright position, it won\u2019t work.",
        "Use your foot to release the upright part of the cleaner so it\u2019s in a reclined position.",
        "The reclined position also makes it a lot easier to push and pull back and forth.",
        "You can also check the brush roll to see if something is stuck in it, like an elastic, a big clump of dirt, or something else.",
        "The roll should spin easily when you move it by hand\u2014if it doesn\u2019t, that means something is lodged in there.",
        "Clean the front nozzle and bristles if they are clogged.",
        "The front nozzle is the section that both releases water and sucks it back up.",
        "Sometimes it can get clogged and prevent the machine from doing what it\u2019s supposed to.",
        "Lift the piece of plastic that covers the bristles.",
        "Use the provided brush cleaner to wipe away dirt that is attached to the bristles, and rinse the plastic in warm water before replacing it.",
        "You may notice that it takes longer for your cleaner to suck up dirty water than it used to.",
        "This is a common result of the nozzle or bristles getting weighed down with dirt."
