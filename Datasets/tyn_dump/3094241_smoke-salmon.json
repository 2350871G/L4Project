Decide whether to smoke the whole fish or salmon steaks. Steaks are used for large fish, while keeping a fish whole with its collarbone intact can make it easier to hang in the smoke chamber. Cut accordingly. If doing more than one salmon, consider selecting fish of an equal/similar size for best results. Soaking the Fish in Brine Make up a solution of the salt and water as per the ratio outlined above.  Add the fish to the brine. Let soak for 1 hour. Remove the fish and drain. Rinse to remove accumulated salt. A stiff brush can help remove any lumps of salt that may have formed. Drying the Fish Dry the fish at the appropriate temperature. It should be cool and dry air at 50 to 56\u00baF/10 to 18.3\u00baC. If you cannot provide this, some other options are:\nDrying outdoors: Place in the shade or the sun will ruin the fish.

Smoke for at least another 30 minutes after it has reached this internal temperature. At all times after the 30 minute internal heating up, keep the fish above 140\u00baF/60\u00baC, even when continuing to smoke it.

You can still take your fresh catch straight to a commercial smokery to have them do it perfectly for you. Storing the Smoked Salmon Remove the smoked salmon from the smokehouse. It must be attended to immediately to prevent bacterial growth. For short-term storage: Allow the fish to completely cool, then wrap in food-grade plastic wrap or wax paper (wrapping it while still warm can encourage mold growth). To be doubly sure of no mold growth, wrap in cheesecloth before wrapping in plastic wrap. Store in the refrigerator. This must be consumed within 1 to 2 weeks of smoking. For long-term storage: Allow the fish to completely cool. Wrap tightly in suitable food-grade plastic and freeze. Cooking Smoky Salmon Rig up a wok as a fast smoker. To make this contraption, simply line the wok with foil. Put 4 ounces/110g of tea leaves, 8 ounces/250g rice and 2 teaspoons of sugar on the base of the wok.  Place a wok rack over the top of the ingredients. Lay the fresh salmon on top of it (fillets or whole fish). Put the lid on. Fold more foil right over the lid to seal it to the wok. Cook the wok on high. Cook for about 5 minutes, then lower the heat. Cook for another 10 minutes on a lower heat. Check halfway to see how the fish is going. Serve immediately. Any uneaten portions must be refrigerated and eaten with a day or two. Do not leave the smoky fish sitting at room temperature for any extended period. It is not smoked, just smoky in flavor.",
