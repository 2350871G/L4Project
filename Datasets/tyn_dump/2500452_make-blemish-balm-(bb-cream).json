To counteract that, choose a liquid foundation that is a few shades darker than you would normally use. Since you're diluting the foundation, you may want to choose a higher coverage foundation than you normally would. Foundation comes in light, medium, and full coverage formulas. If you want your BB cream to be sheer, light or medium coverage foundation will work well. For BB cream with a little more coverage, start with a full coverage foundation. If you can, go with a familiar brand that doesn\u2019t irritate your skin."
