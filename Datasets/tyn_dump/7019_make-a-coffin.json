Tape 2 pieces together side-by-side to make a piece wide enough to create your template. Note that you can change the dimensions of the coffin by adjusting any of the measurements. Create the outline of the coffin\u2019s lid using the center lines as guides. Draw a 24 in (61 cm) horizontal line at the top of the cross shape and a 17 in (43 cm) horizontal line at the bottom. Create the side lines by drawing straight lines to connect the ends of all the horizontal lines. You will now have the completed outline of your coffin. Make a second template that is \u20444 in (1.9 cm) smaller for the base. Cut out the first template and trace it onto another 2 pieces of shelf paper taped together. Measure in \u20444 in (1.9 cm) all the way around and draw the new, smaller outline in the middle. Cut this new template out as well. This will be the template for the base of the coffin. It needs to be \u20444 in (1.9 cm) smaller so the sides can be screwed around it. Create templates for the sides on 1 ft (0.30 m) wide strips of shelf paper.

This will give the coffin a depth of 1 ft (0.30 m). Feel free to make it shallower or deeper by using thinner or wider strips of shelf paper for the templates. Cutting the Pieces Use a circular saw to cut the base of the coffin out of plywood. Trace the base template onto a \u20444 in (1.9 cm) 4 ft \u00d7 8 ft (1.2 m \u00d7 2.4 m) sheet of plywood.

Make sure you are using the smaller of the 2 outline templates you made for the base or the sides won\u2019t fit properly around it. Cut the sides out of plywood using a circular saw.
