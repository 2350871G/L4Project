        "If you can, try to find a sealer that is non-yellowing.",
        "A good sealer to use is a polycrylic sealer.",
        "Avoid using polyurethane, if you can, as those tend to yellow over time.",
        "How long the coats take to dry will depend on the sealer itself.",
        "Most sealers will dry within 2 to 3 hours, but you might want to refer to the label for more specific drying times.",

        "Remove all metal hardware and store it in a box or a plastic re-sealable bag.",
        "If the knobs or handles are made out of wood, consider leaving them on so that you can weather them too.",
        "Sand the edges and corners using a medium or 100 grit sandpaper.",
        "Use a quick, flicking motion.",
        "Keep going until some of the raw wood starts to show though.",
        "Don't worry about getting it perfectly even.",
        "It's okay if some parts of the edges and corners still have paint on them.",
        "If you left the handles or knots on, give them a give buff with the sandpaper too.",
        "Focus on the areas that will get the more wear, sure such the edges.",
        "Go over the entire cabinet using a finer grit sanding sponge.",
        "This will help \"blend\" in the initial weathering you did on the edges.",
        "It will also buff the paint, making it look less new.",
        "It can also help give the cabinet a slight texture.",
        "Clean the cabinet and your work area to get rid of any dust.",

        "Focus on the cracks and corners where dust and dirt are most likely to collect.",
        "You will want to buy specifically designed weathering wax for furniture.",
        "You can find it in hardware stores as well as in some arts and crafts stores.",
        "Finish off with furniture wax.",
        "This will not only re-seal the paint, but also help protect the raw edges you just uncovered through sanding.",
        "Start by applying a small amount of wax onto the tips of a large, short-bristled brush.",
        "Use small, circular motions to \"massage\" the wax into the cabinet.",
        "Work in small areas at a time, and pick up more wax with your brush as needed.",
        "Finish off by buffing the wax with the brush.",
        "It should not feel sticky when you are done.",
