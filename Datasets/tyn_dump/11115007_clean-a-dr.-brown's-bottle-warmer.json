If you\u2019d prefer, however, you can wash it by hand with soapy water instead. If you place the basket on the bottom rack in a dishwasher, the force from the sprayer could cause the basket to become dislodged or damaged.

Dip a soft cleaning cloth or a non-abrasive sponge in warm water mixed with a few drops of mild dish soap and squeeze out any excess water. Then, gently wipe down the outside of your Dr. Brown\u2019s bottle warmer, as well as the inside of the heating chamber. Do not place the appliance underwater. Empty the reservoir, then add a small amount of uncooked rice and water. After the reservoir has soaked for about 5 minutes, pour out all of the soapy water. Then, pour in about 2 tbsp (24 g) of uncooked, non-instant rice, along with 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of water. The measurements of the rice and water don\u2019t have to be exact.

Clean your Dr. Brown's bottle warmer about once a week or any time you notice an odor coming from the reservoir. Descaling the Warmer Descale your bottle warmer every 4 weeks or if it isn\u2019t working. Over time, hard water can cause limescale buildup on the inside of your appliance. Running vinegar through the warmer will help break up that buildup, ensuring it can continue to work properly. Often, if the warmer stops working properly, it needs to be descaled.

Also, wait at least 30 minutes after using the warmer before you attempt to clean it to ensure it\u2019s not too hot. Empty the heating chamber and reservoir. Remove the reservoir from the right side of the Dr. Brown\u2019s bottle warmer and empty it. Then, tilt the warmer to the side so the reservoir chamber is facing up, and let all of the water drain out of the heating chamber. Pour 2 oz (50 ml) of white vinegar and 4 oz (100 ml) of cold water into the reservoir. Vinegar is a safe and all-natural cleaner, and its high acidity makes it very effective at removing scale.

        "When your Dr. Brown\u2019s bottle warmer is working correctly, you should see 2-3 air bubbles coming from the bottom of the reservoir after you place it into the compartment.",
        "This happens when some of the water is released into the warmer, so that\u2019s a sign that all of the scale has been removed.",
        "If you don\u2019t see the bubbles, repeat the descaling process until you do."
