Make sure all the sticks and branches you collect are dry and will burn easily. Collect as many dry sticks, twigs, and large branches as you can.

Depending on your specific fire starter kit, the magnesium might be in the shape of a rod instead of a block. Scrape the magnesium as close to the ground as possible so that you don't waste any of the shavings."

Starting Your Fire Aim the block at a downward angle toward the pile of magnesium shavings. Hold the block with your non-dominant hand and the metal blade with your dominant hand. Position the block so that the side with the flint is facing upward. The flint is the thin black rod imbedded in the silver block of magnesium.
