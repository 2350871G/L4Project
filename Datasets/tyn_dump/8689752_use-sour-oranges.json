    "text": " Making Marmalade Cut each orange in half. Slice the oranges crosswise around the middle (not on the stem ends). Do this for the Seville oranges and navel orange. Separate the seeds from the fruit. Nestle a non-reactive mesh strainer into a bowl. Remove the orange\u2019s seeds as you squeeze the oranges over the strainer. Tie the seeds securely in cheesecloth or muslin, and set the pouch aside. Seeds are high in pectin, which will give your marmalade the texture of a rich jelly. Slice the oranges thinly.

Squeeze halved oranges over a bowl covered by a mesh strainer. Alternately, use a stationary or hand-held citrus squeezer to juice sour oranges. Discard the seeds caught by the mesh strainer. Make naranjada. For every four juiced oranges, mix in 1/4 cup sugar and 1\u00bd cups water. Serve the juice ice-cold. Drink the juice plain, or mixed into a cocktail. Naranjada is a popular South American beverage. Make a wet rub for meat or fish. Mix a finely chopped clove of roasted garlic with three tablespoons of sour orange juice. Add salt and pepper, to taste. Rub the mixture onto meat or fish before cooking. For example, try this wet rub on grilled, baked or pan-fried fish. Make dressing. Use the juice when you want to make dressing. Try making a salad dressing with the juice of two sour oranges and one regular orange, a tablespoon of Dijon mustard, a cup of olive oil, one crushed garlic clove, half of a small red onion (finely chopped), and sea salt, to taste. Pickle vegetables with the juice. For example, try pickling onions with sour orange juice. Add the pickled onions to gyros or tacos. Boil and drain two large red onions (thinly sliced). Combine the onions with 1\u00bd cups sour orange juice, a tablespoon of sugar and a teaspoon of salt. Allow it to sit for four hours, uncovered. Brewing Tea Peel the oranges.

The white pith is bitter, thus you want to cut as much of the orange part only as you can. Arrange thin pieces of peel on a baking sheet. Use a large chopping knife, such as a Santoku knife.

Submerge bagged tea in hot water. Boil water until it reaches 212\u00b0F (100\u00b0C). Fill an empty tea bag or sachet with the dried, chopped peel. Steep the bag of sour orange in a cup of hot water for six to seven minutes.
