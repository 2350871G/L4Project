However, if your bird has caked on droppings or has been sprayed by a skunk, then a bath is required. Other reasons for bathing include cleaning out or assessing a wound on your bird. If your bird is sick, then it\u2019s possible that they may stop grooming themselves. If this happens, then you\u2019ll need to bathe them. Also, take your chicken to the vet as soon as possible."

This can be done with rabbit nail clippers, a coarse nail file, and secateurs for the spurs. To add vibrancy and shine to the bird\u2019s face, comb, wattles, legs, and feet, a light coating of olive oil may be applied with a cloth the morning of judging. Avoid adding excess oil as this will attract dust and make these areas appear ashy and dirty. Only enough oil should be applied so as to just bring out the natural vibrancy of the areas.

If your bird is sick, then it\u2019s possible that they may stop grooming themselves. If this happens, then you\u2019ll need to bathe them. Also, take your chicken to the vet as soon as possible. Choose a washing station location. This needs to be in an area that is average room temperature, not too cold or drafty. It\u2019s also best if the flooring is tile, concrete, or another substance that is water-resistant. You\u2019ll need a fairly large flat surface to work on. You could use a sturdy table or even sit on the floor next to the bins. A mudroom would be an ideal place in the house or a wash rack outdoors. Set up the washing station. Lay a few old, large towels out on the floor. These should cover the entire washing area floor. Then, bring over 2 large bins or tubs and set them in the middle of the towels. The bins can be metal or plastic, just make sure that you are comfortable rinsing them out afterward. Don\u2019t use these same bins or towels for any other cleaning purpose.

Set another towel a little bit away from the bins. You\u2019ll use this dry towel as a drying station for your chickens. Put 5-6 drops of dish soap into 1 of the bins.

Test the water with your hand before putting a chicken into it. You should be able to submerge your hand and only feel a slight warmth, no burning sensation. Washing Your Chicken Retrieve your chicken and hold them firmly. Go out to your chicken\u2019s pen and catch the bird that you intend to bathe. Hold the bird firmly, so that its wings are both pressed against its torso. Keep your bird in this position until you place them in the bath. Lower your bird into the soapy water.

        "Drying Your Chicken Wrap your bird in a clean, large towel.",
        "Move the bird directly from the final soaking bin to the dry towel on the floor.",
        "Then, place another clean towel around the chicken.",
        "Press the towel gently against your chicken and move it around very slightly.",
        "This will help the towel to absorb any moisture sitting on your bird\u2019s feathers.",
        "Since chickens are unable to fully regulate their body temperatures, if you release your wet chicken into the pen they will likely catch cold.",
        "Keep your movements gentle in order to avoid damaging your bird\u2019s feathers.",
        "Use a blow dryer on the lowest setting to further dry your birds.",
        "A towel is a great drying tool, but it will not get deep into the feathers.",
        "Remove the towel around your bird and cradle them against your chest or the towel-covered ground.",
        "Put the blow dryer on the lowest setting and aim it toward your bird.",
        "Continue going until your chicken is dry.",
        "Keep the open end of your hair dryer at least 6 inches (15 cm) away from your bird to avoid damaging the feathers with too much airflow.",
        "Don\u2019t ever dry your chicken on a high setting, as you could risk burning its feathers.",
        "Have someone help you hold the bird since the noise of the hair dryer may frighten it.",
        "Release your chicken back into the pen.",
        "As soon as your bird\u2019s feathers feel dry to the touch, you can place them back in their pen.",
        "If possible, clean the pen up a bit beforehand to keep your birds staying clean for just a bit longer.",
        "Preparing Your Chicken for Show Start washing a couple of days before the show.",
        "When preparing birds for show it is best to wash them 2-3 days prior to judging, allowing them to regain the sheen of their natural oils.",
        "Feet and vent areas can be gently touched up on the day of judging.",
        "White birds being prepared for show may be given a second rinse containing a very small amount of optical whitener such as \u2018Bluo\u2019, which brightens their colouring.",
        "Handle your bird very carefully, as broken feathers may impact on the success of the bird.",
        "Keep them clean until the show.",
        "After washing place the bird in a clean pen with fresh bedding, replaced whenever soiled, until the show to maintain cleanliness.",
        "Take care of other pre-show preparation.",
        "For example, the nails and spurs of show birds should be neatly trimmed and filed down to the beginning of the blood filled quick, the lighter coloured, raised area in the underside of the toenail.",
        "This can be done with rabbit nail clippers, a coarse nail file, and secateurs for the spurs.",
        "To add vibrancy and shine to the bird\u2019s face, comb, wattles, legs, and feet, a light coating of olive oil may be applied with a cloth the morning of judging.",
        "Avoid adding excess oil as this will attract dust and make these areas appear ashy and dirty.",
        "Only enough oil should be applied so as to just bring out the natural vibrancy of the areas.",
        "For other show preparation, check out How to Show Chickens.",
        "Do a last minute wipe before the show.",
        "Just before placing the bird in its cage at the show, gently wipe it all over in the direction of its feather with a silk cloth, e.g.",
        "a silk scarf.",
        "This helps to align and smooth feathers, and to add extra sheen to the bird.",
        "The healthier, happier, and more confident your bird appears, the more likely the judge will favour it.",
        "Ensure your bird\u2019s health, diet, and comfort around humans is maintained throughout show preparation."
