Hold that parting stop in place and take away the bottle. Then scoot the parting stop in a little bit closer to the already attached parting stop.

        "If you see any cracks, you might want to discard the bottle, as it will be very fragile and potentially dangerous.",
        "Remove the clay lubricant reservoir and empty the contents of the bottle into the garbage.",
        "If the drilled out glass disc isn\u2019t in the bottle, it\u2019s probably stuck in the drill bit.",
        "If that\u2019s the case, try to pry it out with a paperclip edge.",
        "Sand the drilled hole.",
        "Use sandpaper to file down the sharp edges created by drilling the hole into the bottle.",
        "Then rinse the bottle with water to wash out any glass bits, and allow the bottle to dry again.",
        "150 grit paper will sufficiently smooth out the rough edges of the hole.",
        "Insert the lights into the bottle.",
        "Remove the decoration lights from the box, and pull the lights taut so they can lay straight.",
        "Check to make sure the string of lights work by plugging them into an outlet.",
        "If the lights light up and are working correctly, insert the first bulb on the string in through the hole that you drilled out.",
        "Continue inserting the lights one by one, being sure to keep the outlet plug remaining outside the bottle.",
        "To help fit the light bulbs through the hole more easily, push the light against the cord, and push both through at the same time.",
        "Be careful not to cut the lights cord on the edges of the hole.",
        "You might have to turn the bottle upside down in order to move the lights inside the bottom \u201cup\u201d to make room for the rest of the lights entering through the base of the bottle.",
        "Secure the lights with a stopper.",
        "Once you\u2019ve finished feeding the lights into the bottle, wrap the stopper around the remaining strand hanging from the outside of the bottle, and insert the stopper into the hole.",
        "The stopper will protect the cord from being cut by the raw glass edges of the hole and keep the lights inside the bottle.",
        "Finished!"
