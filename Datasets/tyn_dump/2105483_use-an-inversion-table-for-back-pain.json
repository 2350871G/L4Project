Inversion Routine for Back Pain Use an inversion table as part of a treatment program recommended by your doctor. Inversion therapy is rarely used to treat chronic pain, so it is only useful for mild relief. Anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, an exercise routine, epidural injections and even surgery may also be used to treat your condition. Use gentle movements whenever you use an inversion table. This will keep you from further injury or pain. Secure yourself in the inversion table. Push back on the handles until you are horizontal. Stay there for one to two minutes to allow your blood flow to change before continuing. Push back further to a 45 degree angle. Breathe deeply and stay there for one to two minutes. Raise your hands above your head to create a better environment for spinal traction. You should feel comfortable that you are steady in the table before doing this. Continue working up to five or more minutes at a 25 degree angle for one week. Try it twice per day to help your body grow accustomed more quickly. Increase your angle by 10 to 20 degrees per week, until you are comfortable with an angle between 60 and 90 degrees for one to five minutes.  Use the inversion table three or more times per day, or whenever you are feeling intense back pain. Inversion tables will only provide temporary relief, so you may need to do it more often to get a good benefit from it. You do not need to do a full 90 degree inversion.
