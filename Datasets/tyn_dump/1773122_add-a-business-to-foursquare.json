The business' name should be a correctly formatted name, as you would have seen it on its name on the business' sign. If the company doesn't have an exact numbered address (or is at an intersection of two criss-crossing streets), you may type in the closest street name to the business. The first street must go into the Address field and the cross street into the Cross Street field. Be careful of addressing the business if the business has it's location in one area (such as a corporate location of a smaller company) while it's real location is someplace else. List the corporate address in the address fields while placing the map pin in the location of the business. Watch out for bigger named-national/international-known businesses (McDonald's, Walmart and similar). Take the address of that particular store and never the corporate address of the store unless the item you'd like to add is the corporate headquarters. If the place is inside of another place, you can add the location. Some examples could include a separate Emergency room entrance to a hospital or a store inside of a mall or outlet mall. These can be entered singly and don't violate the duplicate rule of adding new businesses."
