        "Continue for as long as you feel okay walking in the water.",

        "Push yourself as hard as you feel comfortable, without getting too winded or tired.",

        "Deep-water running, often called aqua jogging, requires deeper water than simple shallow water walking.",
        "Many pools will set aside a lane at a particular time for this activity.",

        "Purchase a buoyant life vest or water belt.",
        "Find a suitable buoyancy jacket or vest.",
        "The pool might supply buoyancy vests, but you should also be able to find them at any sporting goods store.",
        "You may also want to consider a water belt that you can cinch at your waist as you move into deeper water.",
        "This accessory will help you perform the water walking/jogging motions when you are in the deeper end of the pool.",

        "You can alternate your water jogging routine by kicking your feet in a bicycle motion, especially when you are in deeper water and can\u2019t touch the ground because of your buoyancy vest.",
        "Keep your feet flat and move them in a circular motion, as if you were pedaling a bicycle.",
        "You can also stay still and move your feet up and down as quickly as possible, as if you were running in place.",
        "Trying Water Aerobics Find a class at a time that's convenient to you.",
        "Check your local gym, sports center, or public pool to find a water aerobics class that works for you.",
        "Be sure to talk to the teacher before booking to reassure yourself that you're choosing the right class and that everything is a good fit for you.",
        "Follow the instructions during the class.",
        "The teacher will instruct you what to do; simply follow along.",
        "Be sure to ask questions if needed.",
        "This method of working out in the pool offers a chance to socialize with others and to get fit through regular classes.",

        "After you have memorized a whole routine from the class setting, you may be able to do it on your own.",
        "However, there is a plethora of moves that are used during a water aerobics class.",
        "Inform your instructor of any disabilities, so that the exercises can be modified if need be.",
        "Warm up at the beginning of your exercise routine.",
        "Do a warm up that includes 5 to 10 minutes of stationary jogging, marching (high knees), jumping from one foot to the other or doing jumping jacks.",
        "This cardiovascular exercise speeds up your heart and breathing for the rest of the routine.",
        "Move from shallow to deeper water.",
        "Begin your routine by only submerging yourself up to your waist or chest in water.",
        "After you have the water aerobic moves down, you can go into deeper water.",
        "Find a place in the pool or lake where you can comfortably perform your exercises, according to your height.",
        "Vary your movements.",
        "Do arm circles and leg circles.",
        "Next do squats, lunges, side kicks, front kicks, back leg kicks, and sideways walking to strengthen and tone your muscles.",

        "Stretch for a few minutes after you do your exercises.",
        "Do a stretching routine against the side of the pool for 5 to 10 minutes once your muscles are warm after exercise.",

        "Try placing your heel on the floor and your foot on the side wall of the pool.",
        "Lean into the stretch to cool down your calf muscles.",
        "Participate regularly.",
        "The benefits of aqua aerobics include strengthening your leg and arm muscles, flexibility, and resistance training, especially the faster you push and pull in the water.",
        "Of course, the best benefits will come from attending regularly.",
        "Work out for 30 minutes to an hour 3-5 times each week for the best results.",
        "Kickboarding Get a kickboard.",
        "Even top swimmers use kickboard workouts to strengthen the muscles in the legs and align their swimming posture.",
        "It's a great way to add extra pool laps into your daily swim laps if you go to the local swimming pool daily/regularly, while concentrating on your stroke and breathing methods at the same time.",
        "It also burns calories.",
        "Many pools supply these for users to borrow, but they're not expensive if you need to buy your own.",

        "Hold the kickboard out with your arms straight.",
        "Place your hands at one end of the kickboard and place the other end up against your chest.",
        "Your arms should stretch out across the entire length of the kickboard.",

        "Kick your legs.",
        "Hold the kickboard against your chest and put your body weight on it so that you can lift your legs off the ground in the water.",
        "Kick your legs, doing laps up and down the pool.",
