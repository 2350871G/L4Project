The method used depends on what you have available and what you prefer by way of taste and texture. Whichever method you choose, after taking the patties out of the fridge, spritz them with a little cooking oil or brush them with some melted butter before cooking. Broiler/grill: Preheat the broiler (upper level grill) to medium heat. Line a broiler pan with foil, for easier cleanup after cooking. Place the burgers in the broiler pan. Broil them for 6-7 minutes on each side or until thoroughly cooked. Frying pan or skillet: Add oil or butter to the pan and fry the burgers well. Be sure to use low heat and a long cook to properly cook the burgers the whole way through. Place on the barbecue grill. Cook as usual for hamburgers on the barbecue. Bake: Place in the oven on 350\u00baF/180\u00baC for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on thickness. You may like to flip them over halfway, testing doneness regularly."
