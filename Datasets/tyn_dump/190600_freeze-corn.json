Cake pans work well because they spread out the corn and transfer the heat nicely. Freezing the corn on a flat surface is a good idea to freeze each kernel individually and ensure that you don't have a big, difficult to manage, block of starchy corn when you defrost it. If you're freezing lots of corn, cycle the warmest batches from the cooler to the freezer to keep the temp of the freezer high. Don't put extremely hot corn straight into the freezer, or you'll lower the temperature and slow down the process considerably. You don't have to freeze them initially before bagging them, but it is a good idea to cool them down by doing this process at least for a little while."

You don't want them totally full, just enough so you can close them easily and then flatten them out so they store easily.
