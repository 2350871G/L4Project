        "Using a regular nail polish brush, apply a dark or royal blue glitter polish from the tip of your nail to the middle, leaving a strip of silver just above the red.",
        "Repeat on the rest of your nails and let them dry for about 15 minutes.",
        "Paint silver over the middle, overlapping with the red and blue.",
        "Reinforce the middle strip by covering it with silver glitter polish, using a nail striper for the best application.",
        "Paint horizontally right over the strip, then spread small, thin vertical strokes over the red and blue sections.",
        "Continue adding vertical silver stripes, stretching them almost to the tip and cuticle of the nail, until the transitions between colors start to look more seamless.",

        "Repeat this blending, striping process with the same red and blue glitter colors as before.",
        "Extend short strokes of red up into the silver, and paint stripes of blue downwards to subtly blend the colors.",
