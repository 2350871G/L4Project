        "Set up a scenario to increase the likelihood that your ferret will do the behavior you want with a click and treat.",
        "Alternatively, watch the ferret for the behavior you want to encourage.",
        "Then offer a click and reward.",
        "For instance, if you want to teach your ferret to come, try putting it in the crate you normally use to carry it places.",
        "Close the gate.",
        "When the ferret is looking at you, open the gate, and lure it out with a treat towards you.",
        "As it comes towards you, offer a click and give the treat to the ferret.",
        "You can also use clickers for litter box training.",
        "When the ferret uses the box, give a click and a treat to encourage the behavior.",
        "Add a verbal common and signal.",
        "Once the ferret starts getting the idea, say the word you want to associate with the trick.",
        "It can also help to add a hand signal or gesture to reinforce the idea.",
        "For instance, when you want your ferret to come, you might say, \"Come, Rover,\" as you tap the ground to encourage it to come your direction.",
        "Keep rewarding the ferret with a click and a treat when it comes your direction.",
        "Phase out the clicker, and rely on the command.",
        "Once your ferret starts to understand, reinforce the trick by making it a little more difficult.",
        "Eventually, you can stop using the clicker and just say the command.",
        "For example, you might have someone hold your ferret across the room and practice calling it to you.",
        "Use the clicker and treat to reward it.",
        "If your ferret seems to understand, try just using just the command, rewarding it with a treat when it comes."
