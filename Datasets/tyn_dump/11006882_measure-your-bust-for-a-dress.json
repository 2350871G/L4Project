Position the tape directly over your nipples and relax your arms at your sides. If possible, get someone to help you take the measurement so you\u2019re able to keep your arms down. If you don\u2019t have anyone to help you take your measurement, you can do it on your own. Just hold the measuring tape in both hands, bring it around your bust, and put your elbows down at your sides. Make sure the measuring tape is not too high or too low. You should be measuring right where the most protruding part of your bust is, not underneath. That is a completely different measurement. It is recommended to use a flexible plastic measuring tape instead of a fabric one. They tend to stretch over time and give you an inaccurate measurement. If you\u2019re going to wear a bra under your dress, make sure it fits properly. A good fitting bra fits snug around the torso and the straps stay in place. As for the cups, your breasts should fill them perfectly without any gaping or spilling."
