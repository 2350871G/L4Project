Then, hold the measuring tape at your waist and bring it down as long as you want the skirt to be. Write down this length measurement. For example, if you're making a kid's skirt, the waist might be 20 inches (51 cm) x 2 = 40 inches (100 cm) and the length may be 15 inches (38 cm). An adult skirt may be anywhere from 18 to 30 inches (46 to 76 cm) long. You'll need to double the measurement in order to have enough fabric to bunch together at the waist. If you'd like an even fuller skirt, you could triple the waist measurement."
