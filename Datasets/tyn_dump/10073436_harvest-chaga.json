At this time, the trees that chaga grow on have gone dormant and the mushroom has the peak amount of nutrients. In the summer, the chaga will have the most water content and all of the nutrients will be flushed out until the following fall. Look for birch trees in cold northern areas. Identify birch trees by their curly, paper-like bark. Chaga is parasitic and grows exclusively on living trees in birch forests in the northern hemisphere. Look for paper birch, yellow birch, cherry birch, or heart-leaved birch when you look for chaga. Find large knobby growths on the trunk that resemble black charcoal.
