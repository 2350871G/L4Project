Collect several sheets of paper in nearly any pattern or design that appeals to you. Some good sources can include wrapping paper, old magazines, old books, comics, and crossword puzzles. If you are unable to find anything you like in print, you can also find images you like online and print them onto standard printer paper. When selecting images and patterns, pay close attention to the size of the print. You'll need to make sure that the pattern is small enough to fit over the surface of your shoe.

You can also cut the paper into small strips or cut out individual shapes from the pattern. Small pieces work best since they will crease less when you apply the paper around the curves of the shoe. Cutting the paper with scissors will create smooth, straight edges. Another option would be to simply tear the paper into small pieces.

        "Tidy the inside edge.",
        "While not strictly essential, you may wish to mask the messy, uneven inside edge.",
        "You won't be able to see this inner edge while the shoes are on your feet but you will see it when the shoes are off.",
        "Begin by trimming away any paper that is not stuck in place.",
        "The simplest option is to paint over the messy patchwork edge with a paint color that matches the inner lining of the shoe.",
        "Another option would be to glue a ribbon around the entire inner edge of the shoe.",
        "Doing this would hide the messy inner edge while creating an aesthetically interesting accent.",
        "Add any desired embellishments.",
        "You can keep the shoes as they are at this point, but you could also add other embellishments to the surface to create a slightly different look.",
        "Some possible options include sequins, glitter, buttons, and bows.",
        "Let everything dry.",
        "Make sure that any glue, sealer, and paint has dried before you handle or wear the shoes.",
        "As a general rule, it is best to wait 12 to 24 hours after completing the shoes before actually wearing them.",
        "Wear the shoes.",
        "Your newly decoupaged shoes should now be complete and ready to show off."
