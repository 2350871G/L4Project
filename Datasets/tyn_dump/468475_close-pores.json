                    "description": "Pores are the oil-producing openings of hair follicles, and their size is essentially determined by your genes, which means it can't be permanently changed. Pores can also be affected by your skin type: pores appear larger and more visible on skin that's naturally oily, while dry skin can seem almost poreless. Pores can also get larger if dead skin cells and oil are allowed to accumulate. They can become larger if your collagen is weakened by aging or exposure to UV rays."

Get into the habit of cleansing your face each and every night so your pores will be less likely to get clogged. Cleanse your face with warm water to avoid irritating your skin. After cleansing, splash your face with cold water. This will make your pores appear smaller, although the effect is only temporary. Pat your face dry with a soft towel."

Choose a cleanser that's sulfate free. Sulfates are harsh cleansers that can strip the skin of its natural oils and leave it dry and itchy. Avoid using a cleanser with scrubbing beads on a daily basis. The beads could be irritating to your skin, and should only be used 2-3 times a week."

It might sound counterintuitive to use oil to wash your face, but it's actually quite effective. The oil binds with your skin's natural oils and gently washes away dirt, sweat, and makeup without the need for harsh chemicals. Just smooth it over your skin and use a wet washcloth to wipe it off using a circular motion. Here are a few oil combinations to try out:\nFor oily skin: Mix 1 teaspoon castor oil and 2 teaspoons jojoba oil. For combination skin: Mix 1/2 teaspoon castor oil and 2 teaspoons olive oil. For dry skin: Mix 1/4 teaspoon castor oil and 2 teaspoons coconut or olive oil."

Exfoliating your skin regularly will prevent your pores from getting clogged so quickly. The result will be closed, small-looking pores as opposed to clogged pores that look big and open. One of the best ways to exfoliate is by simply using a washcloth. Wet your face and scrub it gently using circular motions. You could also use a facial loofah pad, which digs slightly deeper to remove dead skin. Facial scrubs are also good. Try a mixture of ground almonds and honey. If you have sensitive or acne-prone skin, using a physical exfoliant like a washcloth or loofah might irritate your skin. Instead, try using a chemical exfoliant, like an alpha or beta hydroxy acid."

Heat a small pot of water until it begins to steam, then hold your face over it and drape a towel over your head.
