To address very stubborn mold or mildew, use a \u00bc cup of bleach to 2 \u00bd  gallons of water.

Let your awning dry if you do not plan to clean it further. Make sure it dries completely before stowing, or begin cleaning with cleaning solutions after the awning is throughly rinsed. Extend and stabilize your awning. If you have an awning stabilizer kit, use it! Cleaning the Awning Use a stiff brush for acrylic awnings, and a softer brush for vinyl awnings. How you clean your awning will differ slightly for these different common awning materials.

Spray or brush your cleaner on the underside of the awning. If you are using a spray bottle, saturate the underside of your awning with spritzes of your solution. If you are using a brush, dip your brush into the solution and apply it evenly to your awning. Apply solution to the top of your awning with a brush. When addressing the top of your awning, it is probably easiest to apply with your long-handled brush. Scrub the hard plastic area the awning retracts into, but be gentle with the rest of the fabric. Let the solution sit for 5 minutes. Use your brush to gently scrub at any mold or mildew stains. If the stain comes off very easily, it will probably rinse off with water and you do not need to scrub. Rinse both sides with your hose. Make sure all the cleaner is rinsed off. If the water is not running off easily, dip one corner so that the water runs down it and off your awning. Allow your awning to dry completely before retracting it.
