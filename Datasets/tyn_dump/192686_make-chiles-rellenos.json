Then turn the broiler to high. If your broiler doesn't have a high or low setting, just turn it on. Line a baking sheet with foil and put the peppers on it. Get out a rimmed baking sheet and tear off a sheet of foil to cover it.

Flipping the peppers with the tongs will ensure that you don't burn your hands on the hot peppers. The peppers will blister and blacken in spots. This is important for creating a deep smoky flavor. Rinse the peppers and rub away the skins. Turn off the broiler and remove the baking sheet. Run cold water over the peppers so the skins loosen. This will also make them cool enough to handle.

Once you've put the filling into a pepper, gently fold the pepper shut so the edges of the slits overlap. You shouldn't see filling coming out of the peppers.
