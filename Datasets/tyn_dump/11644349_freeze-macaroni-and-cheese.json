If it\u2019s large enough, you can plug your sink drain and fill it with ice water. Make sure that you\u2019ve cleaned it out beforehand!

Arrange a large sheet of aluminum foil over the bottom and edges of a new casserole dish. Before storing the baked macaroni, scoop the pasta into the foil-lined dish.
