Ideally, reapply using a sealant recommended by the manufacturer, or at least one that specifically mentions cork on the label. This is usually a water-based polyurethane finish. You may use curable oil or hard wax oil, but these are more work to apply and last for a shorter time. Typically, to apply polyurethane, gently abrade the floor and roll on the finish using a foam roller. Leave it untouched for 24\u201348 hours. Follow the instructions on your finish label if it gives contradictory advice. Floor-stripping chemicals may harm the cork. To avoid having to use them, stick with the same type of finish each time. A typical home may get 5\u201310 years of use out of a polyurethane finish, or 1.5\u20132 years from wax. Cork floors in busy public buildings or businesses may need sealing every few months."
