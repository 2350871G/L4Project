Insert the tube of caulk into the caulking gun before placing the nozzle tip where you'd like to cover a crack and squeezing the caulk out slowly. Let the caulk dry completely before painting the brick, following the directions that come with it to ensure the cracks are fixed properly. If you see larger cracks or potential structural issues, consult a professional so they can help restore your brick wall before you paint it. If you just have a few very small cracks to fill, it's not necessary to use a caulking gun. Squeezing the caulk directly out of the tube works as well."
