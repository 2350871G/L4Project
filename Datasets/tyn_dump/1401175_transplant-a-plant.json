        "Reduce watering, but don't omit it.",
        "A week before the date, move the plant outside.",
        "Leave it outside for 1 hour on the first day, 2 hours on the second day, and so forth.",
        "Keep it out of direct wind and sunlight, and water it often during this week.",
        "Take the plant outside in the morning each day.",
        "You will leave it outside 1 hour longer every day.",
        "Plan to transplant during the cool part of the day.",
        "It would be even better if it is overcast or drizzling.",
        "Early morning is a good time, but early evening would be even better, because then your plants won't have to deal with the heat of the day while acclimating to their new home.",
        "Fill the planting bed with gardening soil.",
        "Choose the area that you will be moving your plant into.",
        "Make sure that the area has enough sunlight/shade for your type of plant.",
        "Dig up any untilled soil, and replace it with gardening soil.",
        "For even better results, mix some compost into the soil.",
        "It would be best to buy the soil from the store.",
        "This way, you can ensure that it is pest, disease, and fungi free.",
        "Dig a hole big enough to hold the plant's pot.",
        "Unless the pot is made out of peat or paper, you will be removing the plant from the pot and placing the root ball into the hole.",
        "It is difficult to tell how big the root ball is when the plant is still in the pot, however, but if you make the hole the same size as the pot, you can ensure a good fit.",
        "Turn the pot upside down and slide the root ball out.",
        "Place your hand over the top of the pot first, so that the plant is sticking out between your fingers.",
        "Carefully flip the pot upside down.",
        "If the plant doesn't slide into your hand, lightly tap the rim of the pot against a firm surface, like a table or bench.",
        "Do not grab the plant by the stem and pull it out.",
        "This can damage the plant.",
        "Leave the plant in the pot if it's made from peat or paper.",
        "Instead, cut the sides of the pot so that the roots can reach the fresh soil sooner.",
        "It would be good idea to tear away the top inch (2.5 cm) of the pot so that it sits below the soil when you transplant it--otherwise it may soak up the water before it gets to the roots.",
        "Loosen the root ball with your fingers, if needed.",
        "Most root balls are already loose, but some of them are so tight that they take the shape of the pot.",
        "If this happened with your plant, gently squish the root ball until it loosens up.",
        "If the root ball is still too firm, make 1/8 to 1/4-inch (0.32 to 0.64-cm) deep incisions into the root ball with a clean knife.",
        "Skip this step if the plant is in a peat or paper pot.",
        "Place the root ball into the hole.",
        "The top of the root ball should be level with the top of the hole.",
        "If the hole is too deep, lift the plant out, and add a few more inches/centimeters of gardening soil.",
        "If the plant is in a peat or paper pot, simply place the entire pot into the hole.",
        "Fill the space around the root ball with more soil and pat it down.",
        "The hole will be a little too big for the root ball, so scoop some soil into the spaces between the root ball and the hole.",
        "If the hole caves in and becomes shorter than the root ball, simply add more soil around the top of the root ball so that everything is level.",
        "Gently pat the soil down when you are done.",
        "Water the plant thoroughly.",
        "After this initial watering, water the plant as often as needed.",
        "Depending on the type of plant you have, this could be daily, weekly, or only when the top layer of soil is dry.",
        "For even better results, add some fertilizer into the water.",
        "Be sure to use the right type for your plant, however!"
