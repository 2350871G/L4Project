Use a solid wood instead if you want to give the chest a natural finish. Use boards that are \u20442 in (1.3 cm) thick. A toy chest that is 29 in \u00d7 18 in (74 cm \u00d7 46 cm) and 13 in (33 cm) high is a good size if you aren\u2019t sure. You can get different types of solid wood, plywood, or MDF at a lumber yard or home improvement center. MDF stands for medium-density fibreboard. It is a bit denser than plywood and has a smoother surface, but is not as strong as plywood and can sag under heavy weight. Plywood is slightly more expensive, but is stronger than MDF."

Plywood or MDF are the most economic choices for the wood, but you can use any type of wood you want. Use a solid wood instead if you want to give the chest a natural finish. Use boards that are \u20442 in (1.3 cm) thick. A toy chest that is 29 in \u00d7 18 in (74 cm \u00d7 46 cm) and 13 in (33 cm) high is a good size if you aren\u2019t sure.

It is a bit denser than plywood and has a smoother surface, but is not as strong as plywood and can sag under heavy weight. Plywood is slightly more expensive, but is stronger than MDF. Lay out 6 pieces of \u20442 in (1.3 cm) wood for the chest. Lay out the pieces on a flat work surface in the shape of the box. Place the bottom in the middle with the front, back, and sides laid beside it where they will go. Put the lid off to the side for now.Tip: Get the pieces cut for you at a home improvement center to make the assembly super fast and easy. If you have the tools and know-how, you can cut the pieces yourself.

You can adjust the measurements if you want to make the chest larger or smaller. Sand the pieces with 120-grit sandpaper to remove any splinters. Sand the edges of the boards by hand or with an electric sander so that there are no splinters or sharp edges. Sand the surfaces of the boards if there are any rough spots. Put a thin line of wood glue along the edges of the pieces where they will touch. Slowly squeeze out a bead of carpenter\u2019s glue along the lower edges of the sides, front, and back where they will sit against the bottom piece.

Making a Bucket Toy Bin Sand a premade 24 in (61 cm) table round to smooth it. Start with 120-grit sandpaper to smooth out any rough spots.

You can buy a prefabricated round table top at a home improvement center, or get one custom cut there from a solid piece of wood if they don\u2019t have them for sale.

Let the stain dry between coats if you plan on applying more than one. You can seal and protect the finish with brush-on or spray-on polyurethane if you want, or leave it as is. Create a seal on the underside of the table top with rope. Flip the table top over and place a 17 gallon (45.42 L) galvanized tin tub in the center of it. Trace around the bucket with a pencil. Use a hot glue gun to glue \u20444 in (1.9 cm) rope to the underside of the wood 1 in (2.5 cm) inside the traced circle. Check that the table top sits flush on the tin bucket right away after you create the seal. Peel the rope off and adjust it to get a tight, flush fit if you need to. Attach table legs if you want to make the storage bin taller. Use 4 4\u20136 in (10\u201315 cm) prefabricated table legs. Use a drill with a metal bit to drill holes for the legs in the bottom of the bucket and attach them with the provided hardware. You will be able to find different kinds of prefabricated table legs at a home improvement center, where you got the premade table round.
