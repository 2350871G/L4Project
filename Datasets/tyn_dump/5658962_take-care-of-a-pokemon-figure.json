Over time, this will fade the colors and may cause the materials to become brittle. Do not place the figure near direct heat. It may melt or become misshapen. Choose a place where it won't be taken by younger siblings or pets. Younger children may play with it roughly, while pets may leave teeth or claw marks on it."

Also be careful not to store it next to anything that might leak onto the figure and stain it, such as markers or nail polish. As with displaying the figure, keep it stored away from heat. A cool, dry environment is the best bet. If storing a set of Pok\u00e9mon figures, reserve a shoebox or similar small box to put them all in. Line it with soft foam and tissue paper, then wrap the figures individually in tissue paper. Carefully arrange them in the box. Add the lid, to keep the dust off. Store as above."
