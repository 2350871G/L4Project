    "text": " Following Flag Etiquette Hang the flag so the union is at the top. Regardless of where you\u2019re hanging the flag vertically, the union (the stars of the flag) should always be at the top. Flying an American flag with the union at the bottom is actually a sign of distress. Hang the flag so the union is on your left if you\u2019re hanging it on a wall. According to the flag code, the union should always be at the top of the flag and to the observer\u2019s left when it\u2019s being displayed on a wall. Have the union point north or east if you\u2019re hanging the flag over a street. If you\u2019re hanging the flag parallel to a street, have the union point north if the street runs north to south, or east if the street runs east to west. If you\u2019re hanging the flag over the street so the flag and street are perpendicular to each other, have the union point east if the street runs north to south, or north if it runs east to west. Hang the flag so the union is the farthest point from any building it\u2019s on. If you\u2019re hanging the flag vertically from a flagpole coming off a building, the union should be in the top corner that\u2019s furthest from the building. Putting up Your Flag Use tacks to hang the flag vertically on a wall. Hold the flag where you want it on the wall and push a tack through the grommets on the flag\u2019s top corners. The grommets are the small metal rings used to fly the flag on a flagpole. If you\u2019re hanging a large, heavy flag, use nails instead so it\u2019s more secure. Hang the flag vertically from a rope if you\u2019re hanging it over a street. Run the rope through the 2 grommets on the flag and then tie the ends of the rope to 2 neighboring street lights or tall objects. Make sure the rope is tied high enough that the flag isn\u2019t touching the ground. Use a flagpole if you want to hang the flag vertically off a building. Mount the flagpole off the building so it makes a 90-degree angle with the side of the building. The flagpole needs to be parallel with the ground so the flag hangs vertically on it. Make sure the flagpole you use is long enough to keep the edge of the flag from brushing against the side of the building.",
