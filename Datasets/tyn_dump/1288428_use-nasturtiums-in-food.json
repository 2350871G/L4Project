The leaves and flowers tend to have a milder flavor when harvested in the cool of the morning, before the heat of the day stresses them.

The entire plant is edible, though most people opt for the colorful flowers and buds.

Or, because of the flavor similarity, try substituting nasturtium leaves in recipes that use watercress. Get creative with your own go-to recipes, or search online for recipes that feature nasturtiums. Making Nasturtium Pesto Place a large pot of water over high heat on the stove. Put a lid on the pot to speed up the process of bringing the water to a boil. Make an ice water bath in a large bowl. Fill a large bowl about half-full of cold water, then add roughly the number of ice cubes made by 2 ice cube trays. Do this while the pot is coming to a boil on the stove. Boil 2 c (240 g) of nasturtium leaves for 10 seconds. Once the water comes to a boil, remove the lid and drop all the flowers in. Grab some tongs as you count to 10.

Serve your nasturtium pesto immediately for the best results. Refrigerate the pesto for up to 24 hours if needed. Stuffing Nasturtium Flowers Pick and clean 12 whole flowers right before making the dish. Pinch or cut the stem about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) behind each nasturtium flower so you can remove the flowers whole. Gently dunk each flower in cool, clean water, then very gently pat them dry with paper towels. Put them in the fridge until it\u2019s time to stuff them. Stuff and serve the flowers within 8 hours; sooner is better, however. Pick, clean, and refrigerate enough young nasturtium leaves to cover your intended serving dish. These will be used for presentation purposes, although they are also edible. Combine softened cream cheese with garlic and seasonings.

They\u2019re round, green, and about 0.33 in (8.4 mm) in diameter. Avoid seed pods that are yellowish or brownish, as these have an unpleasant flavor and texture.
