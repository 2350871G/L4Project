This method is for a wine bag, but you can use it to make another type of bag as well. Simply change the dimensions to suit your gift. How wide the felt is depends on how many bags you want to make. The wider the felt, the more bags you'll be able to make. Cut a 6 by 18-inch (15.24 by 45.72-centimeter) rectangle out of the felt. Keep the narrower edge on the fold.
