    "text": " Roasted Preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (230 degrees Celsius). Prepare a baking sheet by coating it lightly with nonstick cooking spray. You can line the baking sheet with nonstick aluminum foil instead of using cooking spray for a mess-free alternative. Cut the kohlrabi into pieces. Slice each kohlrabi bulb into 1/4-inch (6.35-mm) thick pieces and cut each of these pieces in half. For this method, you only need the bulb of the kohlrabi and not the leaves. Use a sharp serrated knife to slice through the thick bulb more easily. A smooth knife is more likely to slip and, therefore, presents itself as more of a danger. Combine the seasonings. In a large bowl, add together the olive oil, minced garlic, salt, and pepper, mixing well to combine. If you do not have fresh garlic on hand, you could substitute 1/8 tsp (2/3 ml) of garlic powder. Coat the kohlrabi. Toss the kohlrabi pieces into the seasoned olive oil, stirring well to coat each piece. The garlic does not need to stick to each piece of kohlrabi, but it should still be distributed among the pieces fairly evenly. Break up any large clumps of garlic with your mixing spoon to prevent the garlic flavor from becoming too concentrated in one area. Transfer the kohlrabi to your prepared baking sheet. Spread the kohlrabi pieces out onto the baking sheet in a single, flat layer. The kohlrabi needs to be restricted to a single layer. If you end up piling it onto the sheet, some pieces may cook faster than others. Bake until browned. This should take roughly 15 to 20 minutes. Stir the pieces occasionally using a spatula to ensure even browning. Sprinkle with cheese. Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese over the cooked kohlrabi before returning it to the oven. Let roast for another 5 minutes, or until the Parmesan cheese becomes lightly toasted and browned. Remove from the oven once you see the Parmesan brown. If you end up using shredded Parmesan instead of grated, you should let the shredded Parmesan melt evenly before removing the dish. Serve hot. As soon as the cheese melts and browns, you should remove the kohlrabi from the oven and enjoy the dish immediately. Steamed Cut the kohlrabi into bite-sized pieces. Slice the kohlrabi bulbs into 1-inch (2.5-cm) pieces, and cut each slice into 1-inch (2.5-cm) chunks. Use a sharp serrated knife to slice through the thick bulb more easily. A smooth knife is more likely to slip and, therefore, presents itself as more of a danger. Place the kohlrabi pieces in a saucepan. Fill the saucepan with 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) of water and add a dash of salt. Do not fill the pan with water any higher than this. If you use too much water, you could end up boiling the kohlrabi instead of steaming it. A low level of water will give you just enough to create steam. Boil the water. Cover the pan and bring the water to a boil over high heat. The lid is necessary to trap the steam. The high heat is also necessary because it creates more steam at a quicker rate. Reduce heat and steam. Reduce the heat to low and let the kohlrabi steam for 5 to 7 minutes, or until soft enough to pierce with a fork. Note that you can also steam the kohlrabi leaves, if desired. Steam the leaves as you would steam spinach, cooking them for about 5 minutes. When done, drain the kohlrabi by pouring the contents of the saucepan through a colander. Serve. The steamed kohlrabi can be enjoyed hot and as is. Grilled Preheat the grill. You grill should be preheated to a medium-high temperature. If using a gas grill, turn on all the eyes to a medium-high temperature. If using a charcoal grill, stack a large pile of coals inside the grill. Wait until the flames die down and a layer of white ash can be seen over the coals. Chop the kohlrabi. Cut each kohlrabi bulb into thin slices and chop each slice into tiny pieces. Transfer the kohlrabi to a large mixing bowl. For this method, you only need the bulb of the kohlrabi and not the leaves. Use a sharp serrated knife to slice through the thick bulb more easily. A smooth knife is more likely to slip and, therefore, presents itself as more of a danger. Season the kohlrabi. Drizzle olive oil over the chopped pieces and add a dash of salt and pepper. Mix well so that all the pieces are evenly coated. You could also add other flavors and seasonings in, as well. For instance, garlic, onion, and chives all work well with the taste of kohlrabi. Wrap the kohlrabi in a sheet of nonstick aluminum foil. With the dull side up, transfer the seasoned kohlrabi onto a sheet of aluminum foil. Fold up the foil to form a tight packet or bundle that can hold the kohlrabi inside. The packet needs to be sealed to trap as much heat inside as possible. Moreover, the seal should face upward as you cook to prevent any kohlrabi pieces from falling out. Cook for 10 to 12 minutes. You do not need to stir the kohlrabi during this time. When done, the pieces should be tender-crisp and easy to pierce with a fork. Enjoy. The kohlrabi is now ready to eat. Stir-Fried Warm up the oil. Pour the olive oil into a skillet and heat it over medium-high heat for 1 to 2 minutes. The oil should be smooth and glossy but not so hot that it begins to steam. Dice the kohlrabi bulbs. Cut the kohlrabi into very small pieces. Slice the bulbs into 1/4-inch (6.35-mm) thick slices, if not thinner, and chop each slice into even finer minced pieces. For this method, you only need the bulb of the kohlrabi and not the leaves. Use a sharp serrated knife to slice through the thick bulb more easily. A smooth knife is more likely to slip and, therefore, presents itself as more of a danger. Cook the garlic. Add the minced garlic to the hot oil and stir-fry for about 1 minute, just until it becomes fragrant and lightly toasted. Watch the garlic carefully as you cook it. Garlic can burn easily, and if it burns, it could ruin the taste of the oil. You will need to toss the oil out and start from scratch if this happens. Stir-fry the pieces for 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer the minced kohlrabi to the hot oil and garlic. Cook, stirring frequently, until it becomes tender-crisp. Do not let the kohlrabi remain still for too long. If you do so, you may end up causing them to burn. Season and serve. Season the kohlrabi with a dash of salt and stir well to coat evenly. Transfer the cooked kohlrabi onto individual serving platters and enjoy. Braised Cut the kohlrabi. Use a sharp knife to cut the kohlrabi bulbs into 1-inch (2.5-cm) cubes. For this method, you only need the bulb of the kohlrabi and not the leaves. Use a sharp serrated knife to slice through the thick bulb more easily. A smooth knife is more likely to slip and, therefore, presents itself as more of a danger. Combine the kohlrabi and other ingredients. Put the kohlrabi, stock, 2 Tbsp (30 ml) butter, thyme, salt, and pepper in a large skillet. Place the skillet on the stove over medium-high heat and cover. The skillet should be fairly deep and 12 inches (30.5 cm) in diameter. If you do not have a lid, you can cover the pan with a circle of parchment paper made to fit inside the mouth of the skillet. Braise for 15 minutes. Stir the kohlrabi occasionally as it cooks, and cook only until the kohlrabi is tender. The kohlrabi needs to be tender enough to pierce with a fork, but it can still be a little on the crisp side. Add the remaining butter. Remove the skillet from the heat and add the remaining 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of butter to it. Swirl the butter into the contents of the skillet until it melts. Make sure that there are no visible swirls of butter left before you serve the kohlrabi. It should be thoroughly incorporated into the contents of the dish. Serve warm. The kohlrabi is now ready to enjoy. You should serve it while still warm. Fried (as Fritters) Heat the oil in a skillet. Pour 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) of cooking oil into a deep skillet and heat it on medium-high for a few minutes. You will not need to completely immerse the kohlrabi fritters in oil, so you do not need enough oil to cover them completely. You do, however, need enough oil to completely cover the bottoms. Shred the kohlrabi. Use a box shredder to shred the kohlrabi bulbs into fine strands. For this method, you only need the bulb of the kohlrabi and not the leaves. Add an egg and the flour. Transfer the shredded kohlrabi into a medium to large mixing bowl and add an egg. Mix well to coat evenly, then add the flour and mix well again. The final result should be a thick mush that can be formed into patties or mounds. Cook the kohlrabi in small batches. Once the oil is hot enough, spoon out dollops of the kohlrabi mush into the oil. Gently flatten each small mound with the back of your spatula to create a patty instead of a clump. Cook until crispy. Cook the kohlrabi fritters for 2 to 4 minutes before flipping with your spatula. Cook the other side for another 2 to 4 minutes. Drain and serve. Transfer the kohlrabi fritters onto a plate lined with clean paper towels. Give them 1 to 2 minutes to drain before dishing them onto individual serving platters. You could also drain the fritters on brown paper bag instead of paper towels.",
