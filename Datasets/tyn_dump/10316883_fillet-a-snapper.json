Use just enough pressure to remove the loose scales without damaging the delicate fish meat. Lay the snapper on a cutting board and examine its skin for leftover scales. Move the palm of your hand back and forth along the sides to feel stubble, which feels slightly prickly but not sharp. Stubble indicates that the scales are gone, so you should feel it after removing the scales. The fish will also look smoother. Gutting a Snapper Make an incision from the fish\u2019s anus to its jaw.

Firmly hold the snapper to keep it steady while you cut. Make a 90-degree angled incision from head to tail. With the knife still in the fish, turn it 90 degrees at the end of the first incision and cut the meat from the head to the tail. The belly flap will also come off with the fillet as you cut the snapper like this. When cutting along the back, you\u2019ll feel the spine with your knife, so you\u2019ll have a guide as to where you should stop. Cut the meat along the back bone to remove the fillet. Use short strokes with the knife as flat as possible to cleanly remove the meat from the bone. You should cut as close to the bone as possible, so no meat is left behind. Turn the snapper over to repeat the process. Turn its back toward you and use a knife behind the gills and side fin. Cut along the back bone, halfway through the fish.
