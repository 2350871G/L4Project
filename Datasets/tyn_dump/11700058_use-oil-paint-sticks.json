Hold the paper towel or rag tightly over the tip and twist the stick around inside to remove the film that forms around the paint. This film will form around the exposed paint overnight after each use, so remember to wipe it off any time you want to use an oil stick. The skin that forms around the paint keeps it fresh and creamy inside, so you don\u2019t have to worry about oil sticks drying out. There is no special way to store oil sticks."

                    "description": "Choose canvas or high quality drawing paper for a classic painting backdrop. Paint on wooden or metal panels for a more unique option. Oil sticks are composed of a pure pigment and a drying oil, which means you can apply them to any surface you can use oil paints on. There is also a small amount of wax in the sticks which gives them their form, but this doesn\u2019t affect how the paint goes onto a surface or dries."

Lightly press the tip of the oil stick against the surface and move it to draw thin, crayon-like lines.Tip: You can also use this technique to add fine accent lines and highlights later on in your painting. This works well to sketch out the initial composition of an artwork. For example, if you want to draw a bouquet of flowers, you can use this technique to outline the heads of the flowers, their stems, and foliage."

Press it hard against the surface and move it firmly back and forth to create thick, paint-like strokes. This technique works well to fill in blocks of color after you\u2019ve sketched out the initial composition of your painting. For example, if you\u2019re painting a bouquet of flowers, you can use these bold strokes to color in the petals and the foliage."

This will build up layers of color that you can manipulate to create different effects. Think about colors that can be mixed together when you do this as well. For instance, if you use red, yellow, and blue to fill in the background of your painting, you can overlap them so you can blend them together later and create many different shades of colors."

This is a good way to create several different shades from 1 color. For instance, if you are making a painting with a blue sky, you can lay down 1 shade of blue pigment using an oil stick, then use a brush and mineral spirits to spread it around and make different shades of blue in the sky."

A blending stick, also known as a blending stump, is a rolled cylinder of paper with a conical tip. They are often used to blend pencil or charcoal, but can also be used to blend oil stick paint.
