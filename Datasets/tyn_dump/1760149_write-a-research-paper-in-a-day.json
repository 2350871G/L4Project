There are a few good websites that talk about the exchange of goods in payment for midwifery services, but not enough information to yield several paragraphs. Cross this topic off your list or absorb it into another subtopic, such as \u201cdaily life.\u201d\nIf any of your searches yielded ideas for new subtopics, add them to your outline. Maybe as you were searching, you discovered that 19th century American midwives frequently clashed with professional, licensed physicians, and you found lots of good sources discussing this issue. Add an appropriate subtopic (such as \u201cconflicts with doctors\u201d) to your outline. Writing a Research Paper Quickly Start drafting. Pick the subtopic that you feel most comfortable with, and start writing about that topic, then work your way through the other subtopics. Keep a Word or Google document open on one side of your computer (or one monitor, if you have dual monitors), and open your first resource under your first subtopic on the other side (or the other monitor). Be sure that you can see both at the same time. This will save you a lot of time switching back and forth between screens and losing your place. Beginning with the first source that you open, start reading carefully. Absorb the information, and then write about it in your own words. Don\u2019t edit much as you go. It\u2019s okay to just let your ideas flow at this point. Don\u2019t waste time editing sentences that you may eliminate later. Don\u2019t worry much about phrasing at this point. If you come to a place where you don\u2019t know how to express your thought, just make a note about what you\u2019re trying to express, highlight it so that you remember to return to it, and move on. Don\u2019t write your introduction first. Your introduction will need to sum up your major points, so you should not write it until you\u2019ve written the bulk of your paper. Cite as you go. Check your research paper instructions to determine how your instructor wants you to cite your sources. Citing as you go can help save time in the long run since you have your sources open and next to you. That way, you don't need to filter through them all again once you've finished your paper. Each time you use information from a particular source, cite it. Be very careful not to plagiarize in your haste. You probably don\u2019t want to write out a full citation as you\u2019re creating your first draft. Simply inserting a link or the title and author\u2019s name is okay at this point. Don\u2019t waste valuable time formatting citations for information that you may decide to eliminate later. Adjust your outline again. After you\u2019ve written a couple of sections, return to your outline. Are you going to have enough information to reach the page limit using only the subtopics you\u2019ve written about so far? Do you need to expand the subtopics a bit? For example, maybe you discovered that there is a lot to say about the daily lives of midwives. You might want to cut out some of the other subtopics that you haven\u2019t written about yet. Finish drafting. Write about any remaining subtopics on your outline, being sure to cite as you go. Keep an eye on the page limit. You don\u2019t want to write the bare minimum, because you\u2019ll look like a slacker. On the other hand, you don\u2019t want to waste valuable time by writing much more than you have to. Take a break. It may seem counterproductive to stop working when you are under a time crunch, but it is important to let your brain rest for a little while so that your ideas can gel. Take a quick walk, do some yoga, eat a snack, or run a quick errand. Write your introduction and conclusion. Now that your ideas are all down on paper, summarize your arguments and major points in the intro and conclusion. Write a strong thesis statement stating your major point or argument. Be sure that this sentence is the last sentence in your introduction. For example, perhaps the major point of your paper on midwives is \u201cNineteenth century American midwives, most of whom were middle-aged, working class women, struggled to practice their trade in the face of economic hardships, increasing legal restrictions, and competition from licensed male physicians.\u201d Revising and Polishing a Research Paper Read and edit everything you have written so far. This is a good time to flesh out half-formed thoughts. Keep your eye out for spelling and grammatical mistakes, but don\u2019t worry too much about this yet. Eliminate any paragraphs or sentences that don\u2019t support your thesis. This is the time to slow down and read everything carefully. Format your footnotes. Be sure to do so according to the style guide your instructor or discipline prefers. Common style guides include\nChicago: http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html\n\nAPA: http://www.apastyle.org/\n\nMLA: https://www.mla.org/MLA-Style\n\nThe Purdue Online Writing Lab (OWL) can help with most style guide questions: https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/ Write your Bibliography. Be sure to only include sources that you actually used in the paper. Refer to the appropriate style guide for formatting. Take another break. At this point, you will probably be very tired. Grab a cup of coffee, eat a snack, do some jumping jacks. Try to resist the urge to look at screens. Your eyes are probably tired of staring at the computer. Proofread your paper. Check for spelling and grammar errors and inconsistencies. If you have access to a printer, it\u2019s a good idea to look at a hard copy at this stage. Submit your paper! Phew!",
