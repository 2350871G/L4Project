Some paperers use a spray bottle of water or a wet sponge. Set the strip of paper, adhesive toward the wall, working from top to bottom, aligning vertically. Smooth the paper to the wall with a dry brush or dry towel. Do not set any wrinkles. Smooth trapped air bubbles to edge of paper to escape. Wet the back of the paper after cutting, apply on the wall as before. Align to first strip.

        "A great work surface for cutting and preparing wall covering can be created by using an inexpensive luan door which can be purchased at home improvement centers. Even if you are a \"weekend warrior\" the benefits of a good work surface will be realized in a single job. These will typically be about 30\" wide and 84\" long. They are very light. You can use over a few sawhorses or on top of an existing table - just put some scratch/paste protection like a blanket on the base table.",
        "Also, no pro hangs wall covering without a good metal straight edge. Try using a 4 foot (1.2\u00a0m) metal ruler. Use this as a guide on the table to cut your wall covering lengthwise.",
        "Single edge razor blades are excellent for cutting. They are very sharp and worth the time and investment to obtain. Although there are blade holders available, I get greater dexterity by simply holding the blade in hand. Buy a box of 100 and discard at about a rate of 1 per single roll of wall covering. Never \"saw\" at your wall covering. That is a sure sign your blade is dull. Why ruin a full sheet of wall covering over a 5 cent razor blade? This is one of the biggest mistakes beginners make - not using a sharp blade.",
        "12\" smoothing brush - typically with 1/2\" bristles.",
        "6\" joint knife - use this to provide a guide for trimming the wall covering against ceilings and trim. Place the blade into the joint and cut on the ceiling / trim side of the blade for a clean cut."
