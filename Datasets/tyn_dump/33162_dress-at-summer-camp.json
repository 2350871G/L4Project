                    "description": "These are much more breathable than synthetic (manmade) fibers, which means air can move through them more easily. When it\u2019s hot, you want as much air to move through your clothes as possible. Linen is another natural fiber like cotton. Polyester is a fabric that you definitely want to avoid during the summer. Rayon is another one that will heat you up. Natural fibers tend to be a little tougher too, which is great for the wear and tear of camp. Cotton tends to wash easier than other fibers as well. If you need to wear dress clothes for a dance or special event, it\u2019s a good time to choose cotton dresses, skirts, and button up shirts over other fabrics. Cotton isn\u2019t just for your shirts, as many shorts, capris, and pants are also made of cotton."

                    "description": "You\u2019ve always heard that black clothing absorbs more sunlight, so it will cause you to get hotter. Summer camp tends to include a lot of time out in the sun, and wearing lots of dark colors will mean being even hotter. White and gray are usually good options. If you tend to wear t-shirts with large graphics, the thickness of some graphics will also make you hot faster. Stick to shirts with less printing on them. Since white does show dirt more easily, maybe light shades of other colors like blue, yellow and red will be better if there\u2019s a chance you\u2019ll get dirty."

Wearing clothes that fit loosely will let them move around more and let air flow through, keeping you cooler. You don\u2019t want to wear clothes that are too big, so find the balance there. You could wear one size bigger than usual, as long as it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s falling off of you. It\u2019s also good to wear clothing made of thinner material that won\u2019t feel heavy on you."

Boxers can cause chaffing on hot days where you sweat and walk a lot, so consider a switch to briefs or boxer briefs. Sports bras or unlined bralettes are a good option as they have less material but still offer the proper support. You should also wear socks to keep your feet cool.

Wearing dirty clothes can actually make you hotter because of all the dirt. On a related note, it\u2019s good to make sure you shower consistently while at camp. As you get sweaty and shed skin cells, it\u2019s good to wash all that off and keep clean."

It also means keep sweatshirts and long pants handy as summer tends to start out cool in the morning, get hot during midday, and often cool off again at night. If you are going to be away from your bag throughout the hot afternoon and cool evening, you probably don\u2019t want to wear your warm clothes all day, but you\u2019ll definitely want to keep them with you. As long as you follow the dress code at camp, it\u2019s always good to have a sleeveless shirt or tank top on under your t-shirt so you can take the top layer off as the day warms up."

For girls, a bathing suit may not be quite as comfortable as a bra and panties, but will serve a similar function. Summer camp may include a lot of spontaneous swimming, so wearing your swimsuit as clothing, or under your clothing, makes it easier to take a quick dip. Once your suit is wet, it probably won\u2019t be the best for walking around in, so you may want to go switch out for dry clothes after you swim."

Girls could wear a light sundress while boys could opt for khaki shorts and a short sleeve polo. You can still look nice enough to impress your peers without going overboard. Since you probably won\u2019t have access to an iron, you want to pack clothes that will hopefully not get too wrinkled in your bag."

Boys may have less restrictions, but will most likely be required to wear swim trunks, as opposed to just underwear or street clothes. Even with a swimsuit, you may want to wear shorts and a shirt that you can take off before you swim. Wear something old that you don\u2019t mind possibly getting chlorine on."

Tucking your shirt in can cause more sweating and discomfort. To avoid the need for tucked in shirts, aim for shirts that are the appropriate length, which is just a few inches past the waistline of your pants."

Its often good to wear pants for hiking to keep out of poison ivy and avoid scratches from brush. Sturdy shoes are a must so you have good support.

You don\u2019t want to do that soaking wet, so plan for the chance of rain with a waterproof jacket or a poncho of some kind. You probably won\u2019t need to carry this around all day, every day, but pay attention to the weather and grab your gear if it seems like a chance of rain. It\u2019s better to carry something around for a while that you don\u2019t need than it is to be soaking wet and uncomfortable.

You want to have good arch and ankle support, so shoes that are falling apart aren\u2019t good for camp either.

        "At camp you will probably be walking from your bed to the mess hall and all over camp in the course of the day.",
        "You don\u2019t want to do that soaking wet, so plan for the chance of rain with a waterproof jacket or a poncho of some kind.",
        "You probably won\u2019t need to carry this around all day, every day, but pay attention to the weather and grab your gear if it seems like a chance of rain.",
        "It\u2019s better to carry something around for a while that you don\u2019t need than it is to be soaking wet and uncomfortable.",
        "Wet clothes, shorts and pants especially, can irritate your skin from all the rubbing if you walk around in them for too long.",
        "Packing Other Essentials Pack shoes that are worn in.",
        "You may be tempted to take some fresh sneakers or hiking boots to camp, but brand new shoes can cause blisters on your feet.",
        "Since you\u2019ll be walking a lot, you want to wear shoes that have been broken in.",
        "On the other hand, don\u2019t wear shoes that are so old they are barely staying together.",
        "You want to have good arch and ankle support, so shoes that are falling apart aren\u2019t good for camp either.",
        "Flip flops or sandals are good to have on hand for time at the beach or pool, but they probably aren\u2019t the best for all day walking around.",
        "Pack multiple sleeping options.",
        "If you are going to be sleeping in a tent or unheated cabin, it may get cold at night.",
        "It might also be hot in a non-air conditioned cabin if it stays hot outside.",
        "Have lightweight and cool pajamas as well as thicker pajamas so you\u2019re prepared either way.",
        "Give your head and shoulders shade.",
        "Wide brimmed hats are great for keeping your head cool and your shoulders from baking in the sun.",
        "You can also carry a scarf or bandana around, which is great to tie up long hair or use as a headband to keep sweat out of your eyes.",
        "It\u2019s also good to keep hair ties handy as long hair will most likely make your neck and shoulders much hotter during the summer.",
        "Consider wearing hair in a ponytail or bun more of the time.",
        "Leave the jewelry at home.",
        "You may want to make a fashion statement with a necklace or fancy bracelet, but it\u2019s better to pass on those at camp for a couple of reasons.",
        "Metal hanging against your skin will make you hotter, and jewelry is just another thing that you might lose in the shuffle of living out of a bag for a week or more."
