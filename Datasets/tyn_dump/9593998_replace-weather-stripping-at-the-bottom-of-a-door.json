Pull the stripping off if it is attached with adhesive.

Use soap and water and, if necessary, adhesive cleaner to thoroughly clean the bottom of your door. If it is extremely dirty or difficult to get to, you may want to  take the door off its hinges for this step. Taking Measurements for New Stripping Measure the width of every door you will install stripping on. If multiple doors need new stripping, take the measurements for all of them. You can do this by using a tape measure across the width of the bottom of the door. Write down your measurements. Remember, you are measuring the door itself, not the width of the doorway. Add up the width of all the doors you measured. Once you have measured every door you plan to buy new stripping for, add up all the measurements you took. Check your math a few times to make sure it\u2019s correct. Add another 5-10% to factor in waste. It\u2019s always better to have too much than to have to go back to the store and buy more.

Even if you already took measurements before buying the stripping, measure your door again before cutting a piece to fit it. If you bought the type of stripping that slides onto the bottom of the door, you can slide on a long piece and mark where to cut it. Cut the stripping with shears or tin snips. Foam and felt should cut easily with heavy scissors or shears. For metal or metal-reinforced stripping, you will need a metal saw or tin snips. Wood should be cut with a hand saw. Read the directions on your stripping product. The stripping you bought will most likely have instructions on the packaging that explain how it should be installed.
