Apply small amounts of the mud at a time, making sure that there is as little extra mud left on the surface as possible. Spread the mud as evenly across the surface of the seam and the immediate area, helping to ensure there are no raised areas or clumps of mud along the surface of the drywall. Clean the knife after the mud is in position."

This will squeeze a small portion of the mud from under the tape while leaving the area underneath smooth and flush with the surface of the sheetrock sections. If using 2 pieces of tape to cover a seam in a wall that is taller, make sure that the edge of the second piece laps under the first piece, as this will minimize the chances of the tape being noticeable."
