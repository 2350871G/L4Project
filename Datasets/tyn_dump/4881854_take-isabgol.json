You should do this twice daily to see positive results. The consistency of curds causes the isabgol to react differently in the cut. Instead of softening the stools further, the isabgol adds bulk and helps solidify loose stools. The combination of curds and isabgol also gives your stomach a good dose of probiotics, which can help heal an underlying cause of diarrhea.
