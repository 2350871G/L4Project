        "It needs to be wide enough to give you a \u20442 in (1.3 cm) seam allowance after you tuck the cording into the tape.",
        "You can use store-bought bias tape or make your own.",
        "The color can match the fabric or it can be a contrasting color.",
        "Fold the bias tape around the cording and hem 1 of the edges.",
        "Open up your bias tape.",
        "Fold 1 of the narrow ends down and press it flat with an iron.",
        "Place your cording down the center and close the bias tape.",
        "Align the end of the cord with the other cut end of the bias tape.",
        "Use a thin cord to create the piping.",
        "The hemmed end should extend \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) past the end of the cord.",
        "Most bias tape is made from cotton, so use the cotton setting on the iron.",
        "If your bias tape is made from a different material, adjust the iron's setting accordingly.",
        "Pin the piping to the top edge of your ottoman's side panel.",
        "Pin the piping to the right side of your ottoman side panel.",
        "Tuck the cut end of the piping into the hemmed end and pin it down as well.",
        "Make sure that the seam on the piping is aligned with the seam on the side panel.",
        "Keep the side panel turned inside-out.",
        "It will be easier to see where you are sewing.",
        "Keep the pins close enough together so that the piping lays smooth.",
        "Every 1 to 2 inches (25 to 51 mm) would be ideal.",
        "Sew the piping to the side panel with a straight stitch.",
        "Try to sew as close as possible to the cording; this should be about a \u20442 in (1.3 cm) seam allowance.",
        "Start and finish sewing at the overlapped seam.",
        "It will be easier to use a zipper foot instead of a standard foot for this.",
        "Match the color of your thread to the piping.",
        "This way, if it accidentally shows through in the end, it won't be as noticeable.",
        "Finishing the Cover Pin the side panel to the top panel.",
        "Place the top edge of your side panel against the edge of your top panel.",
        "Working around the panel, begin to pin the 2 pieces together.",
        "Make sure that the right sides are touching each other.",
        "For a square ottoman cover, place the seam along 1 of the straight edges.",
        "Don't put it in a corner.",
        "Keep the pins 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) apart.",
        "Sew the ottoman top and side panel together using a straight stitch.",
        "Use a thread color that matches the fabric, a \u20442 in (1.3 cm) seam allowance, and a straight stitch.",
        "Start and finish sewing at the seam, and remove the pins as you sew.",
        "Remember to backstitch when you start and finish sewing.",
        "If you are sewing a square ottoman cover, sew in a continuous line and turn at each corner.",
        "Don't sew straight across the piece, cut the thread, and start sewing again.",
        "Clip the corners or cut notches into the seam.",
        "If you have a square ottoman cover, you should cut the corners off as close to the stitching as possible.",
        "If you have a circle ottoman cover, cut V-shaped notches into the seam.",
        "Space them about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart.",
        "This step will help the fabric lay smoother and prevent wrinkling or puckering.",
        "Fold the bottom edge twice by \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) to create the hem.",
        "Fold the bottom edge up by \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) and press it flat with an iron.",
        "Fold it up by another \u20442 inch (1.3 cm), and press it flat with an iron again.",
        "Sew the hem down as close to the inside folded edge using a straight stitch and a matching thread color.",
        "Start and finish sewing at the side seam, and remember to backstitch.",
        "Folding the hem twice will give you a cleaner hem on the inside.",
        "You can also use iron-on hem tape instead.",
        "This way, you won't have any visible stitching along the bottom hem.",
        "Add Velcro to the bottom hem if you wish to wrap it under the ottoman.",
        "Flip your ottoman over, and add a 1 in (2.5 cm) wide strip of hook-side Velcro to each of the 4 edges.",
        "Add the coordinating loop-side Velcro to the hems of your ottoman cover.",
        "You are using the soft, loop-side Velcro on the cover because it is easier to launder.",
        "Use an upholstery stapler to secure the Velcro to the ottoman.",
        "Sew the Velcro itself to the ottoman cover.",
        "Self-adhesive Velcro is not strong enough."
