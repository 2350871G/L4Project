On patterns, this stitch appears as \u201covercast.\u201d\nPull the needle up through the back of the canvas at an edge hole. Wrap the thread or floss tightly against the edge of the canvas.

Produce one stitch per hole along the edge and inner corner of the canvas. Create 2 to 3 stitches per hole located on the outside corners. Connect pieces of plastic canvas. If you need to create a larger canvas, you can stitch together two or more pieces with a whipstitch. In patterns, this stitch appears as \u201cwhipstitch.\u201d\nStack your canvas on top of each other so that the edges are flush. Pull the needle up through the two canvases at the top edge hole. Wrap the thread or floss tightly against the edges of the canvas. Insert the needle into the next hole and pull it through. Wrap the thread or floss tightly against the edge of the canvas.
