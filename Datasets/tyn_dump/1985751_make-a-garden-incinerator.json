These cans be often be purchased from home improvement stores, but used ones will work fine for use as an incinerator."

These holes should be about 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter. They can be drilled using a jigsaw fitted with a metal-cutting blade or with an electric drill fitted with a hole saw bit."

Filling your can with a majority of carbon-rich materials (such as dried leaves and dried stems) will increase the efficiency of the burn. The yard waste should also be dry to the touch before burning."

If for any reason you need to stop the fire, you can place the lid onto the trash can, which will choke the fire out. Under no circumstances should you leave your garden incinerator unattended. When the fire has completely died, you can use the ashes of your yard waste as a soil amendment."
