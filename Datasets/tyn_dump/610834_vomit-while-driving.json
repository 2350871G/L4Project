It is a common problem. If you are prone to motion sickness and vomiting, one way to avoid a dangerous situation is to avoid driving. According to the Mayo Clinic, nausea and vomiting are more common in chemotherapy patients with a prior history of motion sickness. You may want to avoid driving for the duration of your therapy, if you suspect a problem will arise."
