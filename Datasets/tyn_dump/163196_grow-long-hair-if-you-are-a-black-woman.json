                    "description": "Black women tend to have curly new-growth. These curly roots make it difficult for your hair's natural oils to move down the hair shaft and moisturize the length of your hair. Try co-washing (conditioner washing, using just conditioner instead of shampoo and conditioner). Some women do it weekly, some after 5 days, but not daily because product can dry your hair out. Some women also find that wash days take a lot of work and their hair takes forever to dry. Try co-washing weekly, and shampoo as needed but don't wait any longer than 4 weeks - so shampoo at least once a month. There are some women who do wash their hair every day, but with just water. Deep condition with every wash. Deep conditioners containing olive, avocado or sweet almond oil work well. Play around with different products and see what works best for your hair personally. Don't be afraid to move out of the \"ethnic\" hair aisle. Apply heat to your hair and wear a shower cap while you wait--heat activates the conditioner. You can sit under a hood dryer or wrap your head in a towel that has been soaked in hot (but not so hot as to burn you) water; or you can also let your body heat condition your hair. Avoid getting deep conditioner on your scalp. The conditioner can clog your pores and cause alopecia, clogged and inflamed hair follicles, hair loss."

Sometimes if you hit a knot or if the hair has a very kinky texture, you just have to use your fingers and detangle manually. If there's a knot that you can't get out of your hair, add something to soften the hair like water or leave in conditioner to help take out the knot. If the knot still won't come loose, use a pair a good hair scissors to cut it out. If you are trying to smooth your hairline, brush gently, use a soft boar bristle brush. If your edges still float or curl up off of your head, try wetting the hairline and taking a scarf or a durag and covering your head. Let it dry until you have a tamed hairline. Experiment with whether it's best to do this when your hair is completely dry and moisturized, or if it's better to detangle while your hair is wet (you might find it's very easy for your hair to break or be pulled out from the roots if you detangle when dry)."

Twists: Divide your hair into rows. Then divide each row that you just made into 2 separate sections. Starting at your hairline, twist the 2 sections of the first row together. Keep twisting your hair as you move toward the back of your head, grabbing a little more hair each time you go a little further down the row. Bantu knots: Divide damp hair into sections, using a comb to create really precise parts. Twist each section of hair into a \"rope,\" working some gel or pomade into your hair as you twist it. Keep your hair taut until you've twisted the entire section into a rope. Turn the rope a few more times until it starts to curl in on itself. Doing this will create a firm coil at the base. Wrap the rope of hair around the base to create your knot. You can secure it by either tucking the ends under the knot, using pins or using elastics. Be gentle and watch out for traction alopecia. It's the constant force being put on the hair follicle from wear styles that are too tight resulting in breakage and bald spots. The first sign will be pain at the site and inflammation of the hair follicle it'll feel like a bump. Take the hair out where you're suffering from the inflammation and let the hair 'breathe'. Continue to care for your hair while it's in protective styles. The hair will still dry out and the scalp may need some TLC as well. Get a spray bottle and fill it with water, aloe vera juice, some natural oils (anything that will help to restore moisture) and spray it all over. If you have ample time, put your whole head under the shower head toward the beginning of the day and let your hair air dry the rest of the day. If protective styles are being worn for extended periods of time co-washing can also be done, but an application bottle may be needed to try and reach under braids."
