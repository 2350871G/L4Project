        "You don't have to make an X with the ropes like you did for the frame, but you can if you want to.",
        "Wrap the rope around the connector log, finishing with an overhand knot.",
        "This is just like what you did when doing the frame.",
        "Wrap the rope around the connecting log once, then pull the rope under the wrapped rope to create an overhand knot.",
        "This completes your wrapping pattern.",
        "Tie more logs to the top connecting log until you reach the right side.",
        "Follow the same process as you did before.",
        "Wrap the rope around the connecting log with an overhand knot.",
        "Add the next log, then wrap or cross it 2 times around the log.",
        "Wrap it around the connecting log with an overhand knot, add another main log, and so forth.",
        "You may end up with some gaps between the logs, which is fine.",
        "The last log may end up more or less than 6 inches (15 cm) from the end of the connecting log.",
        "This is okay.",
        "Finish with a clove hitch knot.",
        "Wrap the rope around the end of the connecting log.",
        "Cross it over the wrapped rope, then wrap it under the log again.",
        "As you're coming up, pull it under the crossed rope, then pull it tightly.",
        "Cut off the excess rope with a hatchet or scissors.",
        "Repeat the entire process for the bottom connecting log.",
        "This side will be a little tricky because you'll have to move the logs around more in order to wrap the rope around them.",
        "You may have to uncoil the rope and push it through the spaces between the logs, like threading a needle.",
        "Make sure that the logs are straight as you tie them.",
        "You may have to slide them a little to the left or right so that they are not crooked."
