        "The last thing you\u2019ll want is to clean up spilled baby powder after changing your child\u2019s diaper.",
        "Plan ahead.",
        "A child can never be left unattended when changing their diaper \u2013\u2013 accidents can occur very easily if they roll over, climb off the changing area or get caught in any items around the changing area.",
        "Because of this, you\u2019ll want to be sure the time you have to change your child\u2019s diaper is totally uninterrupted.",
        "If you must leave the change area for any reason before completing the change, take the child with you or ask someone else to attend to the diaper change before you walk away from the changing area.",
        "You\u2019ll also need to keep one hand on the child at all times unless you\u2019ve got a changing table with some sort of strap.",
        "Even if you have the strap, however, never leave the child unattended.",
        "Keep a well-stocked diaper bag for when you\u2019re out of the house.",
        "Unfortunately, you won\u2019t always be home when your child needs a change.",
        "You may occasionally find yourself in places where no changing table is available.",
        "If this seems like a regular possibility, consider picking up a portable changing mat for such occasions.",
        "Keep it alongside clean diapers and baby wipes to use as a changing station wherever you are."
