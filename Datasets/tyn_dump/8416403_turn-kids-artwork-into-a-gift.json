However, for many of these projects, you\u2019ll be scanning the finished artwork to your computer. If you decide on one of these, use paper that will fit your scanner. Also:\nBe aware that changing the size of your scanned image may alter the image itself. For example, shrinking your child\u2019s 8.5 x 11-inch self-portrait to fit a small canvas pouch may cause facial features to condense and blur together. Conversely, blowing up a smaller picture to cover a larger dishtowel may cause the blown-up image to appear pixelated. To avoid this, use paper that roughly matches the surface area of the item that it will be transferred to. Or, simply trim larger sheets of paper down to size with scissors."

For example, if you\u2019re going to iron your transfer onto a small wide pouch, you\u2019ll most likely want a horizontal image to cover as much surface area as possible."

For example:\nIf the occasion is a birthday, they could draw a party scene with cake and balloons. For holidays like Christmas or Hannukah, have them draw a Christmas tree or a menorah.

Cut away the excess paper, wrap the image around the holder, and tape the ends together where they meet. Measure the holder\u2019s dimensions before your kids create the artwork. This way you can give them appropriately sized paper to draw on. This helps eliminate the need to alter the size of the image after scanning. It also saves you from wasting printer ink on larger images that will need to be trimmed down to size. For a more seamless look, add an extra inch to the width of the vellum paper when cutting out the image.

Once the whole length of the spine is pressed into the artwork, open the covers all the way and press them into the artwork, too.
