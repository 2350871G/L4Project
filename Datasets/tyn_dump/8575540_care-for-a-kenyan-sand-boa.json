                    "description": "The most important thing is to ensure the habitat is fully escape-proof, allows for air circulation and is large enough for the snake to fully stretch its body inside the enclosure. You can choose either a glass terrarium or a plastic tub. If you chose a tub, drill air holes on all sides of the tub. The holes should be small; only air needs to be able to get in. Plastic tubs are great if you want to save money on a fancy cage. Make sure to put something heavy on top of the tub, like books, so that there is absolutely no chance of escape. Choose a tank if you want a more visually pleasing enclosure. You can purchase clips at the pet store that will hold the lid in place and prevent escape. If you're getting a baby boa, make sure to get a 10 gallon (37.9 L) enclosure. When the snake grows, you can get them a 28 gallon (110 L) enclosure."

UTHs or heat tape are preferred for heating snake enclosures since snakes do not require UV light to survive. You can purchase all of these online or at pet supply stores. Make sure your enclosure is at the correct temperature before purchasing the Kenyan Sand Boa. The warm side of the enclosure should be at about 95 degrees Fahrenheit, and the cool side should be around 80 degrees Fahrenheit. You can purchase a thermometer for the tank online or at the pet store. If you\u2019re using a plastic tub, you will not be able to use a heat lamp as it won\u2019t fit inside the tub and may melt the plastic of the tub. Heat tape and UTHs are more energy efficient and do a great job at heating a plastic tub enclosure without melting it. Make sure to place them outside of the enclosure."
