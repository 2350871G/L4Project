                    "description": "If you\u2019re used to letting your hair dry naturally, add in some time after each wash to dry your locks. The weight of your wet hair will pull your roots flatter against your scalp, and it\u2019s hard to combat that look, even with the best styling techniques. Especially in humid conditions, it\u2019s important to completely dry your hair before you leave the house. Otherwise, more and more moisture will get into your hair, causing it to lay flat on your head. If you hate the idea of using heat on your hair, try using the lowest-heat setting on your dryer. It will take a little longer to dry, but it\u2019ll be less damaging to your hair."

Flip your hair upside down and move the blowdryer back and forth, concentrating on drying your roots. You can use a combination of methods to dry your hair for the maximum amount of volume.

Use a brush to lift your hair along the roots and dry the underside of the hair with the concentrator nozzle. Drying the underside of the roots while they\u2019re pulled up helps them hold a more voluminous shape than if you pulled them flat against your scalp and dried them that way.
