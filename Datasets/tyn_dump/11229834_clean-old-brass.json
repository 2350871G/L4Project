Removing Tough Stains with a Vinegar Paste Dissolve 1 teaspoon (6 g) of salt into \u20442 cup (120 mL) of vinegar. Measure your ingredients with a measuring cup and measuring spoon. Pour your vinegar into a large bowl and add your teaspoon of salt. Give your vinegar a few swirls with a spoon to fully dissolve the salt.Warning: This method will destroy any brass-plated items.
