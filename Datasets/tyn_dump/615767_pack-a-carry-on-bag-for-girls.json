Books/Magazines. If you like books, bring something to read, such as your favorite novel. If you want magazines, bring a bunch that have all your favorite gossip, tips and other things you like. Earphones. These are vital if you want to relax and enjoy your trip without hearing your fellow riders. Try to bring 2 pairs, in case one of yours stops working. (This occasionally happens and the plane earphones are not good at all.) Portable DVD/Portable gaming device. If your plane has Auto-Video on demand, then you will not need the DVD player. Having a portable gaming device is always handy though, just make sure you charge it. A journal. If you already started one, bring it along. If not, then it's the perfect time to start one on the plane! That way you'll have a record of your trip."

For example, try loose fitting jeans, (Not skinny jeans!) a tank top/t-Shirt, and a light jacket, since airplanes can get cold. If you are going on a long/overnight flight, you may want to think about bringing an extra pair of comfortable clothes such as loose sweat pants and an extra T-shirt.
