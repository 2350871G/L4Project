Take the gloves out of your hockey bag and place them on a drying rack, clothesline, or equipment tree so air can circulate. Leave them for several hours or until they're completely dry. Airing the gloves can prevent bacteria from growing on the gloves and will reduce their odor."

If you're using a top-loading machine, put the gloves and equipment into the machine. Fill the machine with cold water and soak the gloves for 15 minutes before running the wash cycle. Front-loading washing machines do a great job of tumbling the gloves and equipment. While top-loading machines can clean hockey equipment, gloves can float to the top of the drum. This is why it's important to soak them before running the wash cycle."
