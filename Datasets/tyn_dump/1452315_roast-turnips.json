They can be roasted whole or cut into chunks if preferred. Roll the peeled turnips or chunks of turnips in olive oil. Add them to the roasting/baking dish and place in the oven. Bake in a moderate oven until tender. They should be turned once or twice during the roasting. Small turnips roast in about 25 minutes, while larger chunks can take another 5 minutes."
