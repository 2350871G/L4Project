A classic style could be to paint black triangle eyes and a nose, then a smiling mouth with teeth in the smile. Or get more creative by using colors to paint clown faces, faces wearing makeup, or cartoon characters. Try using both sides of a pumpkin to make a happy face on one side and sad face on the other. To paint a clown face, use white paint to make eyes and then a color like blue, green, or brown in the center for the pupil. Paint thin triangles above and below the eyes in purple or black. Make a circular red nose, pink circles on the cheeks, and a silly mouth using any color you like. Use different colors to paint swirly rainbow hair on top. To paint cartoon characters, look up your favorite characters in books or online and try to match their faces on your mini pumpkins."
