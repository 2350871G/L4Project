If there is no stamp you or a jeweler can use nitric acid to find out the real karat of a piece. There are nitric acid kits available to purchase online at such sites as Amazon in order to do this yourself. To convert karats to a percentage, divide the karat number by 24 and then multiply it by 100. This tells you what percentage of the material is gold. A 10 karat piece of jewelry is 42% gold, 58% other metals. You are paying for the gold, not the other metals."

Divide this number by 31.1 to get grams or by 20 to get pennyweights. Then multiply this number times the Purity Level (percentage of gold)and you have the value of the gold. Here is simple example: A. Spot Price: $1000/31.1 = $32.15/gram of 24K. So one gram of 24K is worth $32.15 under a $1000 Spot Price. If the gold is 14 karats, determine purity by dividing 14k/24k = 58%, so one gram of 14k would $32.15 x 58% = $18.64."
