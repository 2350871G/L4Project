This should remove any remaining dirt and debris so you can have a clean surface on which to paint. For a concrete porch, scrub it thoroughly with a scrub brush, water, and a concrete cleaning chemical. Be sure to wear the appropriate protective gear to avoid dangerous contact with the chemical. Since wood is a porous surface, you want to wait for your porch to dry completely before attempting to paint. It can take up to 24 hours, especially in humid climates."

Use an orbital sander to sand the old paint off the surface of the porch. You can also use paint scrapers to get some of the old paint off.
