Position the interfacing on the fabric with the shiny side facing down, and move the iron back and forth across the interfacing for about 30 seconds.

Securing the Eyelet without a Tool Push the top eyelet piece into the hole on the right side of the fabric. Once you have created a hole in the fabric, take the top part of the eyelet and insert the male part of the piece through the hole. You may need to wiggle it to get it into place if it\u2019s a snug fit. Make the hole larger if it\u2019s too small for the eyelet to fit through the hole. Snip along the edge of 1 of the cuts you made in the fabric to make it larger and then try to insert the eyelet again. If it\u2019s still too small, snip to make the other cut slightly larger. Position the bottom eyelet on a hard surface. Place the bottom half of the eyelet on a hard surface, such as a concrete floor or piece of wood. Don\u2019t place the eyelet on anything that might get damaged by hitting it with a mallet, such as a wooden table or tile counter. Place the top half of the eyelet over the bottom eyelet. Next, insert the top half of the eyelet through the center of the bottom half of the eyelet. Check to ensure that the fabric is sandwiched between the 2 eyelet pieces. Tap the top eyelet with a rubber mallet 2 to 3 times. Don\u2019t hit the eyelet tool too hard. Just tap it gently a few times.
