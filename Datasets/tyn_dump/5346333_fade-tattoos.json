        "Exploring Professional Solutions Talk to your dermatologist about a laser removal procedure.",
        "Laser removal is the only method that has been clinically proven to reduce the appearance of tattoos.",
        "During the procedure, specially-trained technicians use concentrated streams of light to break up the ink sitting deep below the surface of the skin.",
        "If you want guaranteed, permanent results, it\u2019s highly recommended that you save up your money for a course of laser treatment.",
        "While tattoo laser removal is extremely effective, it\u2019s not quick or cheap\u2014a single session can cost as much as $500, and in many cases it can take 2-6 sessions before you start to see a significant difference.",
        "Receive a series of chemical peels to erase the tattoo gradually.",
        "This type of treatment is sometimes referred to as \u201cchemical resurfacing.\u201d The way it works is that highly acidic chemicals are applied directly to the top layer of skin, causing it to die.",
        "After it sloughs off, the area is given time to heal, eventually leaving behind smooth, clear skin.",
        "Chemical peels were the most popular tattoo removal method before the introduction of light-based procedures.",
        "Even so, reports vary as to how well they work.",
        "These treatments are not without risk.",
        "Possible complications include severe chemical burns and permanent scarring.",
        "Undergo surgery to have the tattoo partially removed.",
        "With traditional surgery, plastic surgeons actually cut out the layers of skin sitting on top of the embedded ink.",
        "The tattoo will no longer be as visible once new skin has grown in its place.",
        "Surgery can successfully fade tattoos to some degree, but in many cases surgeons aren\u2019t safely able to cut deep enough to extract the majority of the ink.",
        "Like chemical peels it\u2019s possible for a surgical operation to leave scars, bumps, discoloration, and other imperfections."
