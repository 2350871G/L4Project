Making a Puree-Based Tea Make a standard simple syrup. Pour 3 cups of water (24.98 fl oz) into a saucepan on the stovetop. Add the sugar. Turn the heat to high. Stir the sugar as the water comes to a boil. Keep stirring until the sugar has thoroughly dissolved. Then remove from heat.

Switch the heat off and add your tea bags or leaves. Allow them to steep for five minutes. If using loose tea, strain the leaves out once they have steeped. Make your puree. Peel and slice your peaches. Discard all the pits. Place the sliced peaches in a blender, cover, and blend until they form a puree. If you like a lot of pulp, transfer the puree directly to a pitcher. If not, mush the puree through a strainer so the larger bits stay behind. Combine and serve. Pour your simple syrup into the puree, along with the lemon juice. Stir to combine. Then pour your tea in and stir until all the ingredients have mixed evenly. If desired, slice additional peaches to add to each glass before serving. For ice, allow the tea to cool off and/or refrigerate after brewing and then serve over ice. Using Peach Nectar Brew your tea. Pour your water into a pot on the stovetop. Turn the heat to high. Once the water boils, shut off the heat. Place your tea bags or loose leaf tea into the water. Allow them to steep for five minutes. If making iced tea, only boil 4 cups of your water (33.31 fl oz.). Add the rest later so it takes less time to cool down. Flavor your tea. Discard your tea bags.
