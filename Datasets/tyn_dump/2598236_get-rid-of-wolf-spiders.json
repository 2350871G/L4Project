        "Sprinkle a small amount of boric acid in dark corners, cracks, and under floorboards and furniture.",
        "Boric acid, also called hydrogen borate, is a white powder used for insecticidal, industrial, and other purposes.",
        "It is relatively non-toxic for adult humans, but it may pose a threat to children and pets.",
        "The chemical is abrasive, cutting into the exterior of the wolf spider and causing it to leak bodily fluids.",
        "It also acts as a stomach poison.",
        "The spider gets it on its legs and ingests the poison as it grooms itself.",
        "Spray outdoor pesticides around the perimeter of the home.",
        "Using pesticides around the foundation will create a barrier, preventing wolf spiders from crossing through.",

        "Natural Solutions Place sticky traps around the house.",
        "Lay out a sticky trap in any area you suspect wolf spiders to be lurking in, paying close attention to dark, hidden corners.",
        "These traps consist of little more than heavy cardboard with extremely sticky glue pasted on them.",
        "Wolf spiders and other pests get stuck on the glue as they step onto the trap.",
        "They become unable to move and die of starvation.",
        "Place glue traps in the corners of basements and garages.",
        "The traps should also be placed beneath and behind furniture, as well as on both sides of any door that leads to the outside.",

        "Kids and pets could get stuck in these traps, and removing these traps can be a difficult process.",
        "Use an organic pesticide.",
        "Plant-based pesticides made with hexa-hydroxyl are generally effective against wolf spiders.",
        "These insecticides come as a dust or powder that can be sprinkled beneath furniture, in dark basement corners, and other dimly-lit areas.",
        "Hexa-hydroxyl is also pet-safe and people-safe.",
        "Hunt wolf spiders down.",
        "If you plan on killing the spiders one-by-one, the best way to do so it to track them down by shining a flashlight in the darkest corners of your home at night.",
        "You can also track the spiders down outside by shining a flashlight into overgrowth, patches of woods, and dense shrubs.",
        "Wolf spiders have discs located in the back of their eyes.",
        "These discs are reflective, enabling them to see at night.",
        "It will also reflect the light from your flashlight, making these spiders easy to track in the dark.",

        "Make sure that you release it far away from the perimeter of your home so that it does not crawl back inside as soon as it is free.",
        "Use a glove when trapping and picking up wolf spiders to reduce the risk of being bitten.",
        "While wolf spider venom is not usually toxic to humans, getting bitten can still sting considerably.",
        "It is also possible to have an allergic reaction to the venom, and wearing gloves will prevent a possible reaction from occurring.",
        "Kill the spider with a broom.",
        "When you see a wolf spider, strike it with a standard broom to kill it.",
        "You can also use a shoe or other solid object to squish the spider.",
        "Similarly, you can use a vacuum cleaner to suck the wolf spider up.",
        "Since wolf spiders are rather large, you can usually kill the adults with a broom.",
        "Smaller spiders are more likely to slip through the bristles of the broom, making brooms less effective as a weapon.",
        "Wash spiders away.",
        "Use a strong jet stream from a garden hose to scare wolf spiders away outside.",
        "Water will not kill a wolf spider, but a strong blast of it will be enough to scare it away and may deter the spider from coming back.",
        "In addition to blasting any wolf spider you see with water, you should also spray beneath roof eaves, window ledges, patio and porch roofs, and decks."
