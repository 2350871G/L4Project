Estimating Without a Thermometer Find the thighs on the turkey. If you don't have a thermometer, you'll need to determine if the turkey is done based on the part of the turkey that takes the longest to cook. Look directly below the drumsticks and next to the breasts to find the turkey's thighs. Since thigh meat is muscular and dark, it takes the longest time to cook. Insert the tip of a knife or a skewer into the thigh. Poke the knife or skewer into the crease between the thigh and the breast. This will probably be covered with skin that you'll have to cut through. You don't need to cut very deep into the thigh. Cut about 2 inches (5.1 cm) or until you see the juices start to run out. Look for clear juices. Once you've inserted the knife or skewer into the thigh, you should see juices run out. If the juices are clear, the turkey has finished cooking. If you see blood or slightly red juices, the turkey isn't done.Tip: If the turkey hasn't finished cooking, return it to the oven and check it again in 20 minutes. Rest the turkey for 45 minutes once the juices run clear. Turn off the oven and take the roasting pan out of the oven. Then put the turkey on a cutting board and let it rest, so the juices redistribute within the meat. Make a gravy with the pan juices while you wait to carve the turkey.",
