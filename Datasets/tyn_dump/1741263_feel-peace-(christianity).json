You may need to make amends with some people, and say, \"I'm sorry!\" Sometimes it feels like unfinished business, if something is left in a state of tension. Break the ice, admit you were wrong in a relationship, and then you and the other person can let go of any bitterness and move on. Sometimes God won't let us rest with ourselves and be whole or complete in Christ unless we take care of certain things. The Bible says reconcile with your fellow man: \"Therefore, if you are presenting your offering at the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your offering there before the altar, and go; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and present your offering.\" (Matthew 5). Another good related verse is: \"Whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father who is in heaven will also forgive you your transgressions. But, if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your transgressions.\" (Mark 11)."
