    "text": " Building a Calcium Atom Model Prepare your materials. You will need glue, scissors, cardstock, string, 40 large craft balls (20 of one color for the protons and the other 20 for the neutrons that's a different color), and 20 small craft balls for the electrons. Glue the protons and neutrons together. Glue both colored craft balls into a ball, alternating between the protons and neutrons as you glue.This will resemble the nucleus. Cut out the cardstock. Cut out a small, a medium, a large, and an extra-large ring using the scissors. Tie the rings. Using the string, tie all the rings in a concentric circle around the nucleus. Glue on the electrons. Glue two small craft balls to the small circle, eight on the medium circle, eight to the large circle, and then two to the extra-large circle. These will resemble all the electrons on the atom. Attach a piece of string to the outer circle to help the model hang.  Enjoy! You can now show off and display your 3D model of the atom calcium. Creating an Oxygen Atom Model Prepare your materials. You will need 16 medium-sized polystyrene balls, a paint brush, three different paint colors, 8 small polystyrene balls, strong craft glue, an eye hook, wire, duct tape, and a fishing line. Paint 8 of the polystyrene balls a paint color. Use the paint brush to brush the paint over only 8 of the medium sized balls. It's recommended to use the color blue as these balls will resemble the protons. Allow the balls to dry until they are no longer wet. Paint the other 8 balls a different color. Repeat the same process with the other 8 balls. Paint the balls another color, preferably red since this is resembling the neutrons, and set them aside to allow it to dry. Paint the small polystyrene balls another color. Using the paint brush, paint the 8 small balls another color, preferably green to resemble the electrons. Set the balls aside to dry until they are no longer wet. Glue the medium-sized balls together. Using the strong craft glue, glue both different colored medium-sized balls together to resemble a nucleus, alternating between the protons and neutrons as you glue. Screw the eye hook on top of the 'nucleus'.  Thread and poke the small balls onto a piece of wire.  Form the wire into medium-sized hoops. Gently form the wire into hoops to resemble the atom. Secure the wire and atom together using the duct tape. Tie the fishing line on the hoops and eye hook to help the model hang.  Enjoy! You can now show off and display your 3D model of the atom oxygen. Forming a Neon Atom Model Prepare your materials. You will need 6 wooden craft sticks, strong craft glue, 10 medium-sized Styrofoam blue craft balls, 10 medium-sized Styrofoam red craft balls, and 10 small yellow Styrofoam craft balls. Glue the medium-sized balls together. Using the strong craft glue, glue both different colored medium-sized balls (the protons and neutrons) together to resemble a nucleus, alternating between the protons and neutrons as you glue. Poke the wooden craft sticks onto different areas of the 'nucleus'. Leave two of the sticks to stand on the ground so the model can stand itself. Poke and attach the small balls. On each craft stick, poke the small yellow balls to resemble electrons. Enjoy! You can now show off and display your 3D model of the atom neon.",
