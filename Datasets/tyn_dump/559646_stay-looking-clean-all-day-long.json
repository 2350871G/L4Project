While you are in the shower, be sure to clean the following: Hair, Face, \"Privates\" (this will also help eliminate body odor). If you are a girl, shave your legs, arms, underarms, private parts. Wash under arms, behind ears and neck too."

Be sure to brush after breakfast, after lunch, before you go to sleep. (If you're in school, eat your lunch and go to the bathroom and brush your teeth with a travel- sized toothbrush and mini toothpaste tube) Also be sure to floss everyday and use a bacteria killing mouthwash."

Also if you wanted to apply a tiny bit of bronzer to give a sun-kissed look, this is absolutely fine. Just make sure to always wash your makeup off before you go to sleep."
