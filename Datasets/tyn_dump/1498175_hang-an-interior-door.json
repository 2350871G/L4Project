Then, measure that distance up from the bottom of the door and mark it, putting a layer of tape above the mark so the wood doesn\u2019t splinter when you saw it. Next, set your door across 2 saw horses, and use clamps to secure the door in place. Finally, use a circular saw to cut off the bottom portion of the door along the mark you made. For example, if you measured 1 \u20444 in (3.2 cm) on the top of your door, cut off 1 \u20444 in (4.4 cm) from the bottom of the door. Wear safety glasses while working with your circular saw. If the difference in height is less than \u20448 inch (0.32 cm), use a 40-60-grit sandpaper or a planer."

Make sure the bottom of the door sits flat and level on the ground so you can make an accurate measurement later on. If the door sits crooked, put shims underneath the sides until it is level. If the door is heavy, have a partner help you lift the door. Measure the distance between the top of the door jamb and the top of the door. Use a tape measure to find the distance between the top of the door frame and the top of your door. Check your measurement in 3 different places across the top of the frame to make sure the distance is the same. If the measurements are not the same in each of the 3 places, use 40-60-grit sandpaper to smooth out the surface.Tip: If you're replacing an old door, then you can use the older one as a template for measurements. Clamp the doors together and mark the height, as well as where the hinges are. Cut the bottom of the door using the measurement you took.

Use an electric screwdriver and the screws provided with your hinges. Work slowly so you don\u2019t crack or splinter your door. Securing the Door Use wedges or shims to hold the door in the frame at a 90-degree angle. Keep the door in an open position so you can attach the hinges to the door frame. Slide wedges or shims underneath the door so the hinges line up with the mortises on the frame. If the door is heavy, have a partner help you hold it in place. Make sure the door opens in the right direction before securing it to the wall. Screw the top and bottom hinges into the doorframe. Use an electric screwdriver to connect the top screws of the top and bottom hinges. Put the bottom screw in the top hinge to help support the weight of the door. Wait to put the rest of the screws in your hinges. If your door is heavy and starts to sag when you let go of it, put all 3 screws in your top and bottom hinges. Close the door to make sure it fits in the frame. Shut the door completely to see if it closes securely.
