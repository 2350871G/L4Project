If you don't have a wig brush, use a wide-tooth comb, which will detangle the hair more easily than a hair brush or a comb with closer-set teeth. Create sections of hair using clips. Pull all the wig\u2019s hair to the top of the mannequin\u2019s head. Leave a layer of hair as a bottom section to start curling. By curling a layer of hair at a time, you will do a thorough job. Wrap a small section of hair around one roller at a time. The section should be no bigger than 2 inches (5.1 cm). Roll it all the way up to the root while keeping the hair as neat as possible.

Repeat with the rest of the sectioned off hair until it\u2019s secured in curlers. Apply heat to the rollers with a blow dryer, if your wig is natural hair. Turn the heat setting on warm and airflow on high. Hold the blow dryer on each roller for no longer than 60 seconds. If you use too much heat, the curls will look messy with stray hairs sticking out. If your wig is made of synthetic hair, DO NOT apply heat to it. The heat will melt synthetic hair, ruining your wig. Remove the rollers from the wig. Gently unwind each roller rather than pulling them out of the hair. Unwinding them gives the wig nicer ringlets. Run your fingers through the curls for a more natural look. Using a Curling Iron Place your wig on your head or a mannequin head. You can curl your wig while it's in place on your head, if you like. This allows you to create exactly the style you want. However, it might be easier to curl the wig on a mannequin head, especially when you're styling the back of it. Heat the curling iron. A good heat setting to start with on a curling iron is 180 \u00b0F (82 \u00b0C), because it\u2019s low enough where it won\u2019t cause damage, but it still curls the hair. Do a heat test on a small patch of the wig at the base of neck or an under layer, because this is a discrete place where no one will notice any damage. Avoid hair that goes around the face or from a top layer. If the curling iron is too hot, the wig will either frizz out or melt. Read the label of all wigs or synthetic hair to see if it can tolerate heat. Comb out the wig so it\u2019s free of tangles. It\u2019s much easier to curl hair when it\u2019s tangle free. To brush it, use a wig brush or wide-tooth comb, which will detangle hair a lot easier than a hair brush or a comb with closer-set teeth. Move the wig brush or comb through the wig starting at the lower end of the strands and move up the length of the hair as you comb. You can also soak your wig in a bowl of cold water and 1  tsp (4.9 mL) of shampoo to detangle it. This alternative can also clean the synthetic fibers. Don\u2019t stretch, pull, or rub the wig against itself, as this can tangle it further. Just swirl it around the bowl. When you empty the bowl, refill it with cold water and conditioner and repeat the swirling process. Section off the wig hair evenly using a rat-tail comb. With the rat-tail comb, move up a weft and clip all the sectioned hair to the top of the head. Use large clips to section off the hair until you have one bottom layer of hair to start curling. Bigger sections will give you bigger, looser curls, and smaller sections of hair will make tighter ringlets. Start curling the bottom layer of hair. Wrap a small section of hair from this layer around the curling iron and hold for a few seconds. Pin the curls up to allow the heat to set the fibers in a curly shape. look. As you create the pin curls, apply hairspray so the curl keeps its shape. Some curling irons require you to wrap the section of hair starting at the top or bottom of the hair, depending on whether you\u2019re using a curling wand or a curling iron with tongs. Wands come with a protective glove for your hand, because you have to hold the hair in place on it. Curling irons with tongs will hold hair in place once it\u2019s secured in the metal grip of the iron. Leave the curls pinned against the head for a minute. The heat will set and cool in the pin curls to hold the style. If the curls are cooled off when you feel them with your hand, unpin them and brush that layer of hair out to create a natural curly look. Move onto the next section of hair. Unclip the next section and start curling that the same as you did with the first. Pin up the curls as you go, so the heat cools for the wig to hold the curls. To achieve a more natural effect, wrap the curls in different directions. Loosen all the curls with your fingers to blend them. This is optional if you want a natural and softer look to curls. Use your fingers to separate individual curls to create smaller, fluffier ones throughout. Set the style with hairspray. If you want tight curls, spray each one individually as soon as they\u2019re taken out of the pins. For relaxed curls, spray them when you\u2019ve finished curling all the hair. Hold the hairspray at least 8 inches (20 cm) away from the wig to prevent product build up and a shellacked look. Using Hot Water and Rods Boil water to pour over the wig. You should test the temperature after it\u2019s done boiling, because it should be around 170 and 180 \u00b0F (77 and 82 \u00b0C) for curling. Hotter than that will melt synthetic fiber.

With the wig either on a mannequin\u2019s head or a flat surface, run your fingers through it. If you use a wide-tooth comb, start combing from the bottom of the strands and make your way to the top until it\u2019s detangled from top to bottom. Straighten a small section of hair.

The section of hair shouldn\u2019t be too much for your pin to hold later in the process. Keep sections of hair small for small curls. Read the wig's label to make sure it can tolerate heat. Be especially careful if your wig is synthetic, as it can melt. Curl the section around the flat iron away from the mannequin\u2019s face. Release the strand from the flat iron, and while the curl is still hot, wrap the hair around your finger. Let it set on your finger for a few seconds to form a curl shape. Pin the curl up with a clip. Take the hair off your finger. It should look flat and circular. Using a flat clip or bobby pin, clip the curl up to the mannequin\u2019s head. Repeat the above step with the next section of hair. Then repeat these steps with each subsequent section of hair until you have them all pinned. Make sure you didn\u2019t leave any loose strands. Use hairspray while the curl is pinned in place so it will hold its shape when you unpin it. Let the pin curls set for at least an hour. An hour is enough time for the curls to form in the wig. You can also follow this process of curling before bed, so your wig can set up overnight. Remove the clips and release the curls. Finger comb through the wig\u2019s curls to blend them together. This makes the curls look more natural. You wig will have a lot of body and movement to it when you use your fingers to separate the curls. To maintain these curls, re-pin the wig at night while it\u2019s on a mannequin\u2019s head.",

        "A good heat setting to start with on a curling iron is 180 \u00b0F (82 \u00b0C), because it\u2019s low enough where it won\u2019t cause damage, but it still curls the hair.",

        "You can also soak your wig in a bowl of cold water and 1  tsp (4.9 mL) of shampoo to detangle it.",

        "Don\u2019t stretch, pull, or rub the wig against itself, as this can tangle it further.",

        "Leave the rods in the hair to let them form the curls.",
        "They may take a few hours to a day to dry.",

        "If your wig is made of synthetic materials, only use the lowest heat setting and be cautious, as you can damage the wig.",
        "For a natural hair wig, you can usually use a higher heat setting on your blow dryer without damaging the wig.",
        "You can also hang the wig on a wire with clothespins to let it dry.",

        "Straighten a small section of hair.",
        "You should straighten the hair before curling, because you want to start with hair that has no waves in it to create flawless curls.",
        "With the straightening iron turned to 250 to 300 \u00b0F (121 to 149 \u00b0C), run it along the section of hair until it\u2019s straight.",
