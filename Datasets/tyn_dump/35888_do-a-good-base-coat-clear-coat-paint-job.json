        "Pay attention to the body of the car as you rinse it this second time.",
        "If there are any areas that need to be sanded again, take time now to do so.",
        "Once the car has been rinsed, dry it thoroughly with the towel.",
        "Rinsing the car off again ensures that all the little flakes of paint and sandpaper are gone.",
        "Tape off the windows, lights, and tires with masking tape and plastic.",
        "Place the tape around the seam of each area that you don\u2019t want to paint.",
        "Then cover those areas with plastic sheeting and apply a second layer of masking tape to keep the cover in place.",
        "Use a putty knife to press the tape down into cracks and crevices.",
        "If you don\u2019t have plastic film or sheeting, use 2-3 layers of old newspaper.",
        "Check out some online tutorials for extra tips and examples of taping off your car.",
        "If you\u2019re working in an area with other tools or furniture, you may also want to spread some plastic sheeting over them to keep them clean.",
        "Priming the Car and Applying the Base Coat Apply 2 coats of primer before applying the base and clear coats.",
        "Check the primer manufacturer\u2019s instructions before you start\u2014chances are you will need to mix the primer with a thinner first.",
        "Once your mixture is ready to go, load it into the spray gun.",
        "Hold the gun about 6 inches (15 cm) from the body of the car and spray in a back and forth motion until the entire body of the car is covered.",
        "Wait about 20 minutes between each coat.",
        "Use an old piece of wood or scrap metal to practice spraying the primer before you begin on your car.",
        "This\u2019ll help you get the feel for the machine.",
        "Sand the vehicle with 2000-grit wet sandpaper after the primer dries.",
        "The primer will leave a slightly uneven and powdery layer on the car, so use your spray bottle and wet sandpaper to gently go over the entire vehicle.",
        "Just sand enough so that the surface is completely smooth.",
        "Wipe down the sanded, primed car with a damp rag once you\u2019re done and let it dry completely before moving on to the base coat.",
        "Spray on the first coat of the base coat and let it dry for 20 minutes.",
        "Check the instructions of the base coat to see if it also need to be mixed with thinners.",
        "Load the liquid into your cleaned-out spray gun.",
        "Hold the sprayer 6 to 10 inches (15 to 25 cm) away from the car and use smooth, even strokes, going from left to right rather than up and down or in circles.",
        "It should take you about 10 minutes to apply the first base coat if you\u2019re painting a small- to medium-sized vehicle.",
        "Apply a second coat of the base coat after the first one has dried.",
        "Use the same technique as before, moving in slow, even, strokes.",
        "This is a great time to check over the vehicle and make sure things are looking even.",
        "Once the second coat has been applied, clean out your spray gun to get it ready for the clear coat.",
        "If you can still see the metal of the frame through the primer and base coat, you may want to add a third base coat.",
        "Let the base coat dry completely before moving on to the clear coat.",
        "It\u2019ll usually take about 30 minutes for the base coat to dry, but depending on the temperature and humidity, it could take closer to 60 minutes.",
        "You\u2019ll know it\u2019s dry when it\u2019s smooth to the touch and your fingers don\u2019t drag on it when you touch it.",
        "If you notice any residue or bumpy areas, sand the area down again and reapply the base coat until it\u2019s even.",
        "Applying the Clear Coat and Finishing the Job Spray the first coat of the clear coat evenly over the base.",
        "Fill your spray gun with the clear coat, following any manufacturer\u2019s specifications from the paint can.",
        "Start at the top of the vehicle and spray from left to right as you make your way down to the bottom of the car.",
        "Use even, long strokes.",
        "Wait 10 minutes after this first coat before applying the second.",
        "The clear coat should be easy to see as it goes on the car, so take your time to make sure the entire body is evenly coated.",
        "You\u2019ll know the clear coat is dry when it is smooth to the touch, rather than sticky.",
        "Apply the second clear coat to create a nice, glossy finish.",
        "Once the first clear coat has dried, repeat the process to apply the second (and final!)",
        "coat.",
        "Remember to use smooth, even strokes and to completely coat the entire body of the car.",
        "If you want, or if you applied particularly thin first and second coats, you could do a third coat, though two is usually sufficient.",
        "Remove the masking tape and plastic before the paint dries.",
        "Right after you apply the last clear coat, carefully peel away the masking tape and plastic sheeting or newspaper.",
        "Do this slowly and try to keep the plastic from touching or getting stuck in the clear coat.",
        "If there is sticky residue left from the tape, ignore it for now.",
        "You can go back to it later and rub it away using something like Goo Gone.",
        "Fix any mistakes or uneven areas by sanding and respraying the area.",
        "Be careful when doing this since you\u2019ve already removed the tape and protective sheeting.",
        "Chances are, if you have to fix anything, it\u2019ll just be a small section that you can carefully spray again.",
        "Remember that you can always use this process of sanding and spraying to fix small scratches in the future, especially if you have leftover paint.",
        "Buff your clear coat for a glossy finish.",
        "Make sure the clear coat is completely dry before you buff.",
        "You can rent a buffer from your local hardware store if you don\u2019t own one.",
        "Use a low setting and buff carefully but quickly\u2014if you leave the buffer on any particular spot for too long, it could burn or wear away the paint you just applied.",
        "You don\u2019t have to buff your car if you don\u2019t want to, but it definitely makes it look shinier!"
