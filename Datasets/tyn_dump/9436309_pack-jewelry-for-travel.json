Put together the outfits that you plan to bring on your trip, and then choose only the jewelry items that complement those clothes. When it comes to jewelry that you wear daily, such as a watch or rings, settle on just one set to avoid overpacking. It helps to choose a single metal for the jewelry that you\u2019ll bring, so you don't need to bring gold and silver versions of staple items, such as your watch."
