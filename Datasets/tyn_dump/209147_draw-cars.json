        "Then, erase the middle 2 circles.",
        "Smooth the corners of the car and erase the line through the wheels.",
        "Use an eraser to remove the line that's running through the wheels.",
        "Then, take your pencil and sketch around the body of the car, making it rounded instead of boxy.",
        "If you prefer an angular cartoon car, you can skip this.",
        "If you sketch rounded curves along the edges of the car's body, use your eraser to clean up the corners.",
        "Draw a small rectangle in front of each wheel to create the bumpers.",
        "Make the rectangle extend about halfway from the wheel to the front or back of the car so it sticks out from the body a little bit.",
        "This will make it look like the bumper.",
        "Repeat this for the other wheel.",
        "Don't draw a rectangle between the 2 wheels since this is where the car doors would be.",
        "Make a small circular headlight and square tail light.",
        "Draw a circle or oval on the front of the car's body.",

        "Sketch a small rectangle inside the trapezoid you drew on the body of the car.",
        "Leave some space between the shapes to create the frame of the car.",
