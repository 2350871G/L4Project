This is a great way to make a plain sheet of paper look for interesting. Most stickers come with white borders, so they will look the best on white paper. If you want to decorate colored paper, look for stickers with clear borders or no borders at all. If you use stickers with white borders on colored paper, it will look obvious. For a polka dot design, try round label stickers or binder paper reinforcements. Match the stickers to the occasion! Use birthday stickers for birthdays, and Christmas stickers for Christmas. Consider the person's interests. If they really like Batman, use Batman stickers. Reuse maps, newspaper, magazine pages, or sheet music. If you don't have the time to make wrapping paper, consider using something that's already colorful or has an interesting pattern. The type of paper you use depends on the size of the gift you are giving as well as the overall theme that you are going for. For example:\nIf the recipient likes to travel, consider using a map. For a rustic theme, try newspaper or brown butcher paper. You can complete the look by wrapping the gift with twine. If the recipient loves fashion, try some magazine pages. Choose something that might interest them, such as makeup ads, clothing models, or hair cut images. Try wallpaper for a fancier gift. It would be even better if you can find embossed wallpaper with an intricate design. Use sheet music for the music lover in your life. If you don't have any sheet music laying around, you can find images online and print them out. Use a website with a printing service to design and print your paper. There are some websites, such as Spoonflower, that will allow you to input your own designs, then print them out on various materials, including wrapping paper. After paying a small fee, you will have your own roll of wrapping paper shipped to you! Each website will have its own set of instructions, so follow the prompts carefully. In most cases, you will need to input a file that's already saved on your computer. A 6 by 6 in (15 by 15 cm) pattern swatch should be sufficient.",
