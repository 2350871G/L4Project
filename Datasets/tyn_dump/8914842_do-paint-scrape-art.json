Then tape a heavyweight paper, such as cardstock, onto the wax paper. Since it\u2019s taped to the surface, it won\u2019t move around when you scrape it. You can also use a cookie sheet as an easy to clean work surface. Squeeze drops of paint along one side of the paper. Grab some squeeze bottles of acrylic paint in assorted colors. Apply drops of paint along one edge of the cardstock, leaving the rest of the sheet blank. If the rest of the sheet is blank, you'll be able to drag the colors across the paper without muddying colors. Vary the drops\u2019 sizes and colors to create patterns. Try arranging the dots in a staggered pattern, or at different distances from the edge of the paper. That way, the lines you'll make by spreading the paint across the paper will have a scalloped pattern. Spread the colors with a piece of cardboard. Scrape a small square of cardboard or foam board across the paper, starting from the side with the paint drops. Drag the paint drops across the surface in straight lines, curved patterns, or any design that suits your style. Instead of cardboard, you can use an expired credit card or old gift card. Fold the paper in half and glue on lettering. To create a card, let the paint dry then untape the cardstock from the wax paper or cookie sheet. Fold it in half so the painted sides face out, and choose the side you like best for the front. Grab some letter cutouts or stickers, and glue or stick them onto the front to spell out a greeting. Using Bright Pastels and Black Paint Color your entire paper with oil pastels. Cover the entire surface of a heavyweight paper with bright pastel colors.
