        "Yarn of whatever colour you choose.  Usually one regular sized bundle will do.  Grab another colour to make a few different coloured dreads to give it some flavour if you want.  Try to grab a textured yarn.  Not the really fuzzy stuff or the baby blanket yarn.  If you choose the right type of yarn it will give you a much more realistic look in the finished product.",
        "Material to use as a base to form your dreads.  This could be anything, an old curtain, an old t-shirt, jeans... anything that you don't have to buy will be fine.  After all, this is the cheap way to get your falls.  You will also need a second material it can be one of the colours from your falls or just a sick pattern. This material will show as it will be the ribbon holding the falls to your natural hair. If you want you can just make an extra single dread and sew the rest to that so its less obvious.",
        "Tape or safety pins.  These are to hold the material in place on a stable surface while you wrap each individual dread. If you tape them to the edge of a table, make sure the tape is really sticky.  You could also use a safety pin and pin it to your couch or mattress.",

Cut the material to the desired length you want the falls to be.

Begin by taking a strand of whatever material you are using and secure it to the edge of a table top. Tape is a good way to secure the yarn to the table. Leaving 1/2 to 1 cm (1/4 to 1/2 in.) from the top, attach yarn to the material you chose by tying a knot. Start wrapping the yarn very tightly around the material.
