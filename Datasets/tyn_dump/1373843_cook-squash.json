    "text": " Roast Squash in an Oven Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (205 C).  Wash the outside of the squash and pat it dry with paper towel.  Decide whether or not to peel your squash. You can cut up and roast thin-skinned summer squash without peeling it. If you want to roast winter squash in bite-sized pieces, then you should peel it with a sharp knife. If you want to roast larger pieces of winter squash, simply slice the squash in half. Then, use a spoon to remove the seeds. Prick the skin with a fork to prepare it for roasting. Season the squash. Spread small pieces of squash in a thin layer over the bottom of a roasting pan and sprinkle them with salt and pepper. Drizzle them with some olive oil. If you're roasting a large winter squash, sprinkle the cut side with salt and pepper and drizzle it with a bit of olive oil. Place both halves of the squash, skin side down, on a metal roasting pan sprayed with cooking spray. Bake the squash. Thin-skinned squash cut into small pieces will roast in about 20 to 30 minutes. Thicker-skinner squash cut in large pieces will take 30 to 45 minutes to roast. Test the squash for doneness. The flesh should be tender and easy to pierce with a fork. Taste the squash for seasonings. Add salt and pepper if needed. Serve your roasted squash. Scoop small pieces onto a plate alongside your main dish. Large pieces can be served individually, or you can scoop out the filling and mash or puree it. Saut\u00e9 Squash on the Stovetop Rinse the squash under cool running water and pat it dry. Cut off both ends. Slice the squash into rings or into small chunks. Peeling summer squash is not necessary. Season the squash with salt and pepper.  Heat some olive oil in a skillet over medium-high until it starts to shimmer. You can also cook a flavorful meat, like pancetta or bacon, in your skillet to render its fat. Then, you remove the meat and saut\u00e9 the squash in the rendered fat. Turn the heat down to medium. Saut\u00e9 the squash until the exterior begins to brown and caramelize. Remove the squash from the skillet to serve it. Taste it for seasoning and add salt and pepper as needed. Serve the sauteed squash in a bowl or serve it on a plate paired with a main dish.  Batter and Deep-Fry Squash Rinse summer squash and pat it dry. Slice both ends off of the squash and slice the remainder into thin rings. Sprinkle the squash with a generous amount of salt and pepper.  Prepare the batter. Crack an egg and pour the yolk and white into a bowl. Lightly beat the egg with a fork, and sprinkle the beaten egg with salt and pepper. Pour cornmeal or flour into a separate bowl. Place both bowls next to the stovetop so that you can batter your squash and then quickly drop it into the hot oil. Pour 2 cups of canola oil into a heavy-bottomed skilled. Heat the oil to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 C), checking the temperature with a candy thermometer. Dip the squash into the egg using either some tongs or your fingers. Then, dip the squash into the flour or cornmeal. Place the battered squash pieces into a mesh basket. Lower the contents of the basket into the heated oil. Cook the squash pieces until they brown and float to the top of the oil. Remove them with the mesh basket, and place them on plates lined with paper towels to drain the oil. Serve the deep-fried squash. The pieces are flavorful enough to serve on their own, but you can also provide a small container of ranch dressing for dipping. Cook Squash in the Microwave Scrub squash with a vegetable brush under cool water and pat them dry with a paper towel.  Cut the squash in half or lengthwise. Pierce the skin with a fork so that the steam can escape. Season the squash generously with salt and pepper. Place the pieces cut side down in a microwave-safe bowl and add 1/4 cup (60 mL) of water. Cover the bowl with a damp paper towel. Cook the squash on high for 5 to 20 minutes until the squash is tender when you pierce it with a fork. Grill Squash on Skewers Prepare the squash for grilling by rinsing it. If you're using wooden skewers, then soak the skewers in water for 30 minutes. Cut your squash into 1\" (2.5 cm) cubes and season them with salt and pepper. Place the squash onto the skewers and brush the cubes with oil or melted butter. Spray your grill rack with cooking spray. Place the squash directly on the rack and cook the pieces over medium-heat for 4 to 5 minutes on each side. Remove the squash when the exterior begins to blacken and the flesh is tender. Grill Squash Halves Preheat the grill to 350\u00baF/180\u00baC.  Cut the squash in halves.  Drizzle olive oil over each half prior to adding to the grill.  Add salt and pepper to taste. You can also use other seasonings, as preferred. Lay on a tray. Place under or on the grill (depending on whether you're using a top-down or bottom-up grill). Grill for 6 minutes per side.  Remove from the grill. Serve immediately.",
