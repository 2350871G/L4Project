Test the oil by dropping a scrap of dough, it should sink to the bottom and immediately float to the top. When this happens the oil is ready. Fry for about 1-2 minutes, only a maximum of six at a time, so that the oil stays hot. When the ausuki appear light, light golden on the edges, flip them, fry for about 20 seconds more. They should puff up. Do not brown! Use a metal prongs to remove them and hold them over the oil to drain before placing on a paper towel to drain more."
