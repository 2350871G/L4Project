Making Beads with Your Own Designs Cut your paper. Cut long triangles from a piece of white printing paper.

For earrings or a bracelet, you might make only a few beads. For a necklace or other larger project, you'll need more. Decorating Your Beads Add paint. Before you add your varnish, use paint to create an additional decorative design along the outside of your beads. For extra texture, use puff paint which dries in a bubble-like form above the surface of the bead. Put on a little glitter. To make your beads sparkly, use glitter glue or loose glitter over the surface of the paper.
