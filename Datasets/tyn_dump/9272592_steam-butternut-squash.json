    "text": " Steaming on the Stove Set up your steamer basket in a pot. Place a medium pot on the stove and put a standard steamer basket into it. Pour enough water to come about 1-inch (2.5 cm) up the sides of the pan. Add the butternut squash and turn on the heat to medium-high. Arrange 1 pound (453 g) of cubed butternut squash in the steamer basket. Put a tight fitting lid on the pot and turn the heat on to medium-high. Bring the water in the pot to a boil. Reduce the heat and steam the squash for 10 to 12 minutes. Turn the heat down to medium so the water bubbles steadily. Steam the squash until it's tender and heated throughout. This should take about 10 to 12 minutes. Remove the steamed squash and serve it. Turn off the heat and carefully lift the steamer basket up and out of the pot. You'll probably want to wear oven mitts when you handle the basket. Pour out the liquid in the bottom of the pot and season the steamed squash according to your tastes. Serve the squash while it's still hot. Refrigerate any leftover steamed squash in an airtight container in the refrigerator for three to five days. Steaming in the Oven Prepare the oven. Turn the oven on to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Move a rack of the oven to the center. Wash and cut the butternut squash.
