For example, if you found the perimeter of the base to be 21, your formula will look like this:1460=32+21h{\\displaystyle 1460=32+21h} Solve the equation for h{\\displaystyle h}. This will give you the height of your prism. For example, if your equation is 1460=32+21h{\\displaystyle 1460=32+21h}, you would first need to subtract 32 from each side, then divide each side by 21. Thus:1460=32+21h{\\displaystyle 1460=32+21h}1428=21h{\\displaystyle 1428=21h}142821=21h21{\\displaystyle {\\frac {1428}{21}}={\\frac {21h}{21}}}68=h{\\displaystyle 68=h}\n\nSo, the height of your prism is 68 centimeters.",
