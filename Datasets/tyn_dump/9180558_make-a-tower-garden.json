Continue adding rocks until the the container is about one-third to halfway full. The size of your bucket or pot can vary depending on whether you grow larger or smaller plants. Your container can be as small as  16 inch (40 cm) wide pot or as large as a five gallon bucket. Insert a wire mesh cylinder lengthwise into the stones. The length ration between your container and the cylinder should be between 1:2-1:3, with the cylinder being longer. Make sure that the bottom portion of the wire mesh is completely covered by the stones. Wiggle the cylinder around to check for looseness. Add peat or sphagnum moss into the wire mesh cylinder. Moss keeps the soil moist. With peat or sphagnum moss on the bottom of your tower garden, you will not have to water as frequently. Fill the cylinder with about 2-3 inches (5-7 cm). Layer potting soil on top of the peat moss. Fill the rest of the mesh cylinder with about 4-5 inches (10-13 cm) of potting soil. Layer this directly on top of the moss. Choose soils that retain moisture and nutrients, like silt or loamy soil. You will layer more moss into the tower garden as you add plants later on.

Check the expected sizes your plants will grow to, and organize your garden accordingly. Plant seedling roots between the wire mesh. Scout out the ideal locations for your seedlings. Place them below the seeds planted to establish a strong root system into the garden. Once your plants are secure, add more peat or sphagnum moss into the wire mesh interior. Plant seeds into the soil at an appropriate depth. Poke your seeds between the wire mesh into the soil. Check the packet your seeds came in for the appropriate depth. Avoid adding additional sphagnum moss around your seeds until the plants have time to grow. Taking Care of Tower Gardens Make sure your plants are watered at least once per week. Water your garden weekly or whenever your plants look yellowing or crisp to the touch. Once or twice a week, stick a finger into your tower garden's soil. If the soil is dry, your plants need to be watered. Water your plants with compost tea once or twice a month.
