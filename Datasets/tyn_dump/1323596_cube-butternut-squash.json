The chef\u2019s knife should have a large blade long enough to reach beyond the width of the largest end of the squash. Slice about 1/4 inch from the bottom of the squash and another 1/4 inch from the stem end of the squash. Gently push the knife through the skin until you feel it is secure in the meat of the squash and not going to slip, then apply more pressure to cut through the squash.

Hold the squash in one hand and peel down the length of the squash in strips until all of the skin has been removed. Remove the skin completely, but don't peel so deeply that you remove too much of the squash's meat. You may find that a Y-shaped peeler with a serrated blade is the best choice to peel the skin. Poke holes in the skin of the squash with a fork and microwave it for 2 minutes to make peeling easier."

Using your chef\u2019s knife, make cuts one inch apart along the length of each section. Do this for all four sections of the squash. Halve the deeper portions of squash along the length. Some sections of the squash will be deeper than one inch. Take these section and lie them on their sides. Cut them in half to create long strips of squash that have the width of a square inch. You can stack several pieces when making this cut, allowing you to cut several strips at one time. Cross cut the strips into 1 inch cubes. Lay several 1 inch strips next to each other on your cutting board, then stack more strips on top of those ones. Make a cross cut every inch of the strips to create one inch square cubes. You should get 4 cups of cubes from a one and a half pound butternut squash.",
