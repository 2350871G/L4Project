        "It will be on the back end, right above the handle.",
        "Turn it clockwise to detach it from the cyclone.",
        "If you\u2019re unsure whether or not your vacuum has a second filter, check the owner\u2019s manual.",
        "It will show you where the filters are as well as Dyson\u2019s cleaning recommendations for them.",
        "Rinse the filter under cold water in the sink.",
        "Rinse debris off under running water only.",
        "Soap and other cleaners could damage your vacuum\u2019s filters, so don\u2019t bother using them.",
        "As you\u2019re washing the stick filter, gently squeeze it to force out any hidden debris.",
        "Keep rinsing and squeezing it until you see nothing but clear water coming out of it.",
        "If you\u2019re cleaning a cap filter, rinse it off repeatedly under running water.",
        "Dump water out of the cap until it looks clear.",
        "The filters can\u2019t be put in a dishwasher or washing machine.",
        "It\u2019s too delicate.",
        "Wash it by hand to ensure they lasts longer.",
        "Set the filter in a warm spot to dry for at least 24 hours.",
        "Any spot at room temperature is fine, but keep the filter away from direct sunlight and heat.",
        "Lay it on a paper towel or hand towel that can absorb some of the moisture.",
        "Then, wait for the filter to dry out completely before you attempt to put it back in the vacuum.",
        "If it still feels wet after 24 hours, give it more time.",
        "Let the filter dry naturally in open air.",
        "If you try to speed up the process, such as by using a dryer, microwave, or flame, you will end up damaging it.",
        "Replace the filter by sliding it back into the cyclone.",
        "Once you\u2019re sure the filter is clean and dry, lower it into the top of the cyclone.",
        "Push it down until its plastic cap is level with the top of the filter housing.",
        "As long as it\u2019s centered in the cyclone, it will work like new again the next time you use your vacuum.",
        "Dyson recommends cleaning the filter at least once a month.",
        "You may need to wash them more frequently if your vacuum doesn\u2019t seem to be working as well as you like.",
        "Check the filters after vacuuming up heavy amounts of debris.",
        "Rinsing off the Brush Bars Use a coin to unlock the floor tool on the end of the vacuum.",
        "The plastic casing covering the brush bars unlocks through a big, circular fastener.",
        "It is usually on the side of the plastic and is recognizable by the slot on it.",
        "Use the slot to give the fastener about a quarter-turn counterclockwise.",
        "As soon as it unlocks, it pops out slightly from the case.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a coin handy, try using a screwdriver or a similar object.",
        "Use something blunt but sturdy to avoid problems.",
        "Pull out the brush bar to pull off noticeable debris.",
        "The brush bar is attached to the fastener you just unlocked.",
        "Hold the plastic casing steady, then pull the bar out with your other hand.",
        "Move it out slowly in case it gets stuck.",
        "Once it\u2019s out, examine it and then use your fingers to pull off clumps of hair and other noticeable bits of large debris.",
        "Wiggling the bar can help free it if it gets stuck.",
        "Rotate it so the bristles don\u2019t get caught on the casing.",
        "Remove the second brush bar if your vacuum has one.",
        "Take a look inside the floor tool\u2019s casing for a smaller brush bar.",
        "Sometimes the smaller bar is next to where the main one was and you will see it sitting there inside the casing.",
        "Lift it up to pull it out of the casing.",
        "Check it over for debris to remove by hand.",
        "Not all models of the V6 have a second bar, so don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t find one.",
        "Instead, look deeper into the floor tool for any loose debris that needs to be removed by hand.",
        "Scrape debris out of the floor tool if it looks dirty.",
        "When you look inside the plastic casing, you may see a bunch of hair accumulated there.",
        "Reach in with a screwdriver or another blunt object.",
        "Pull the hair toward you so you can get it out of the casing.",
        "Remove as much of it as you can to keep your vacuum in working order.",
        "If the brush bars suddenly stop turning when you\u2019re using the vacuum, hidden debris could be the cause.",
        "Most V6s have a little pocket in the back of the floor tool where hair gets trapped and eventually blocks the brush bars.",
        "Rinse the brush bars off under cold water.",
        "Move the bars into the sink and wash them off under running water.",
        "Gently rub them with your fingers to loosen any caked-on dirt.",
        "Try to remove as much of the debris as possible before you finish.",
        "If the brush bars aren\u2019t very dirty, you can skip washing them.",
        "Remove any noticeable debris by hand, then put them back in the vacuum.",
        "Leave the brush bars to dry in a warm spot for 24 hours.",
        "Lay out a paper towel or hand towel in an open area.",
        "Keep it away from direct sunlight or heat to prevent the brush bars from getting damaged.",
        "Then, set the bars there and wait for them to dry completely.",
        "When the bars feel dry to the touch, they are ready to be reinserted into the vacuum.",
        "Dryers and other heat sources aren\u2019t safe to use.",
        "Let the bars dry on their own.",
        "Refit the bars into the floor tool and lock them in place.",
        "Start with the smaller brush bar if your vacuum has one, pushing it into the slot inside the plastic casing.",
        "Add the bigger brush next, fitting it so the end cap is flush with the outside edge of the floor tool.",
        "When they are both in place, use a coin to turn the fastener on the plastic casing.",
        "Give it about a quarter-turn clockwise until you are unable to move the brush bar and the other components of the floor tool.",
        "Clean the brush bars about once a month to keep them turning.",
        "If you pick up a lot of hair, you may need to clean them out more often to prevent clogs from forming."
