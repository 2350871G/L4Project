Either way, you will need to cut the canvas to the size and shape that you want it to be for your project. Use another coaster as a guide to help you choose a size, or use one of your cups or mugs to help you determine how to cut your canvas. Keep in mind that cross stitch is worked in rows, so a square or rectangular design may be the best option. You can cross stitch a circular coaster, but working the rows may be more challenging than working the rows of a design with straight edges. Make sure to cut as close to the edge of your rows as possible. Try to avoid leaving open edges that you cannot stitch into. This is especially important when working with plastic canvas because the edges will be somewhat sharp."

Embroidery thread is also known as embroidery floss and it comes in many different types and sizes. Opt for a heavier weight thread, such as #3 or #5 cotton thread. However, keep in mind that you can always double up your thread if you find that it seems too thin, or pull strands apart of it seems too heavy."

Continue until your project is complete. After you complete your first row, you can begin a new row to continue your work. To make a basic cross stitch coaster, you only need to work the basic cross stitch across all rows of your project. Stitch around the edges. To finish your project, stitch around the edges of your canvas to hide the plastic or cloth edges. Insert the needle through one of the edge squares, then make a full circle around the edge and insert the needle into the next stitch on the same side.
