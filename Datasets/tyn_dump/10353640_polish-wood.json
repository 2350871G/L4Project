Be sure to purchase a formula made specifically for the project you're working on. If you are looking for something more advanced, look into using linseed or tung oil, shellac, varnishes, or lacquers. But be aware that varnishes, lacquers, and some mixtures of oils emit toxic fumes and will require extra safety precautions. For polishing laminate floors, purchase a product specifically formulated for this purpose. Other types of polish won\u2019t adhere to the laminate. Do not use food oils as polish, such as olive or vegetable oil. These will spoil and develop a rancid smell over time. Only use wax over non-oil polishes, such as shellac or lacquer."
