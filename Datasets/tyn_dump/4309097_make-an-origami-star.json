    "text": " Making a Mini Star Take a piece of 8.5 x 11 paper. You can use a blank sheet of regular paper or a patterned piece of paper. But make sure it measures 11 inches on one side. Cut a half inch wide strip. Use the long end of the piece of paper and fold a half inch wide strip. Rip or cut the strip. If you are doing traditional origami, you will fold and rip the paper. You want the strip to be a half inch wide and 11 inches long. Make a knot close to the end of the strip. To do this, bend one end of the strip, close to the top so the strip looks like a ribbon, with two ends and a loop. The short end should be over the long end. Finish tying the knot by slipping the long end through the loop. Don\u2019t scrunch the paper as you pull the knot tight. Keep the paper smooth. Flatten the edges of the knot. You should now have a pentagon shape, with one short end sticking out and one long end sticking out. Valley fold the short end. Valley fold means fold the paper towards you. Tuck the short end into the pentagon so it does not show anymore. You should be able to do this without scissors, but if you left your short end a bit too long, snip it shorter with scissors. Start over with a new strip of paper if you have to snip off more than a \u00bd inch on the short side. Flip over the strip. Valley fold the long end along the edge of the pentagon. It should fall across the front of the pentagon. Flip over the strip again. Valley fold the long end along the pentagon again. Use the edge of the pentagon to line up the fold. Continue flipping and folding the long end. The pentagon should get fatter and fatter as you flip and fold. Stop folding once you have an end that is too short to fold. Tuck this short end into the pentagon, just like you did with the first short end. You should now have a perfect little paper pentagon. Inflate the star. Hold it lightly with your fingers along two of the edges. Push four of the edges with the tip of your thumbnail. The star should begin to inflate. Rotate the star and push on the remaining side to completely inflate the star. Enjoy your mini origami star! Making a Four Pointed Star Take a 6\u201d x 6\u201d square piece of origami paper. You can also make your own square piece of paper by folding or cutting it. Turn the paper over so the decorative or colored side is down. Take one corner of the paper and fold it to meet the opposite corner. Then, unfold it. Repeat this with the other corner. Then, unfold it. You should have an X crease on the paper. Divide the paper into three sections horizontally. Take the bottom of the paper and fold it so it covers \u2153 of the paper. Then, take the top of the paper and fold it so it covers a \u2153 of the paper. Then, unfold the paper. You should have three horizontal folds on the paper. Divide the paper into three sections vertically. Take the left side of the paper and fold it so it covers \u2153 of the paper. Then, take the right side of the paper and fold it so it covers a \u2153 of the paper. Unfold the paper. You should now have three vertical folds on the paper. It should now look like the paper is divided into a three by three grid. Make four diagonal folds on the paper. Take the bottom left corner of the paper and fold it so it meets the bottom left corner of the top right square on the paper. Then, unfold the corner. Take the top right corner of the paper and fold it so it meets the top right corner of the bottom right square on the paper. Then, unfold the corner. You should now have four diagonal folds on the paper. Take the left side of the paper. Fold it \u2153 to the right. Use the crease you made earlier to make this fold. Make a mountain fold and a valley fold on the section you just folded. In the top left of the folded piece, make the mountain fold by folding the top left corner behind itself. Unfold the mountain fold. You should have a diagonal fold on the top left corner. Make the valley fold by taking the top left corner and folding it over so it covers the first \u2154 of the folded section. Then, unfold it. You should have a triangular shaped fold on the folded section. Use the folds to open the paper. Crease down the valley fold and push out the mountain fold. Once the triangle shape on the paper opens, fold down the top of the paper so it lays down horizontally. It should now look like you have a triangle shape coming out of the side of the paper and a horizontal section. Make a valley and a mountain fold again. Take the bottom corner of the folded section and fold it over to make a valley fold. Then, unfold it. Take far left section of the folded section between your fingers and pinch it so it folds. This will create a mountain fold. Unfold the fold. Open up the paper using the valley fold and the mountain fold. Crease down the valley fold and push out the mountain fold. Keeping the paper open on these folds, fold over the right side of the paper. The paper should now have a triangle on the top of the folded right side and a triangle coming from the side of the paper. These triangles are going to be the points of your star. Make a valley and a mountain fold again. Take the top left corner of the folded right side and fold it over. Then, unfold it. This is the valley fold. Take the bottom right section between your fingers and pinch it so it folds. Then, unfold it. This will create a mountain fold. Open up the right fold. This should also lift the triangle shape on the right fold up. Then, lift up the flap in the bottom middle of the paper. Fold it to the left. This should then raise the bottom half of the paper. Use the creases you made earlier on the paper to fold up the bottom half of the paper. Lay the bottom of the paper flat. The bottom fold should now look like an upside down triangle with a flat top. Fold down the left tip of the bottom fold. You should now have a beautiful four pointed star.",
