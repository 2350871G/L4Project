                    "description": "Use a razor blade or a hacksaw to cut the grips lengthwise and pull them off of the handlebars. As you're cutting, apply enough pressure to slice through the grip, but not so much that you scratch the metal handlebar beneath it. Be careful not to cut through any wires on the handlebar. Take your time when you're slicing off the grips. If you want to save the grips, you can blow them off with compressed air. Most people don't have compressed air available at home, so you'll likely have to take your motorcycle to a mechanic to have this done. Another method to try for saving the grips is slipping a flathead screwdriver between the grip and the handlebar and using it to work the grip off. If there's a lot of adhesive holding the grip in place, this method is difficult. If you have chrome grips, skip the razor blade and simply unscrew the bolts at the ends of the grips and slide them off."

Make sure the grips and the adhesive that attached them to the metal is completely gone before proceeding. Don't attempt to use any type of oil-based cleaner or lubricant to remove the adhesive. In order for the new grips to stay firmly in place on the handlebars, the metal must be completely free of residue. Using lubricant may cause the new grips to slip, which could result in a dangerous situation on the road. Make sure the handlebar is clean and dry before proceeding."

It's important to choose a grip that works with your motorcycle to make sure your ride is safe and comfortable. If you aren't sure what type of grips are best for your motorcycle, ask a motorcycle mechanic or the dealership where you  bought your motorcycle. Examine your handlebar. There are ape hangers, beach bars, clubman bars, Motocross bars, drag bars, and other styles of handlebar, each requiring different grips. Take this into account when you make your purchase. Make sure the grips you buy are the right diameter and length. Most motorcycle grips are either 7/8\" or 1\" in diameter and about 5\" long. To figure out which diameter and length you need, measure the old grips before purchasing new ones. Some motorcycles produce greater vibrations than others. These need thick, padded grips to protect your hands from becoming numb after a few minutes of riding."

If you like to go off-roading, you'll need to be able to grip the handlebars without your hands slipping.

Choose these if you ride for sport, especially during the hot summer months.
