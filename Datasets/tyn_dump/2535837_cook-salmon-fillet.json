        "Once all the fillets are accounted for in the bag, pour the marinade over the seasoned fillets.",
        "After pouring, seal the bag completely before flipping it over, allowing both sides of the fillet to be covered.",
        "Finally, set the bag in the refrigerator and let the fillets chill in the marinade for 2 hours.",
        "If you have a lot of salmon fillets, consider marinating them in more than 1 bag.",
        "Split the marinade up accordingly when you go to coat and refrigerate the fillets.",
        "Preheat your grill to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) and drizzle the grate with oil.",
        "Turn on your grill and let it heat up.",
        "If your grill doesn\u2019t have a temperature gauge, hover your hand about 3 inches (7.6 cm) above the grate.",
        "Count how many seconds it takes for your palm to feel the heat of the grill.",
        "For salmon fillets, wait until it takes about 6-7 seconds for your hand to feel warm.",
        "Once the grill is preheated, sprinkle some vegetable oil over the surface to make the salmon fillets easier to flip.",
        "If you can feel the heat within 1-5 seconds, then the grill is too hot.",
        "Grill each side of the fillet for 6-8 minutes.",
        "Space the fillets evenly on the grill surface and let them cook for at least 6 minutes before flipping them over.",
        "Continue flipping as needed, and remove the salmon from the grill when it can be flaked with a fork.",
        "If you\u2019re using fillets with the skin still on, be sure to start cooking with skin facing up.",
        "When flipping fillets to have the skin side facing down, feel free to lower the temperature of the grill.",
        "Serve the fillets while they\u2019re still warm.",
        "Give the fillets a few minutes to cool down once they\u2019re removed from the grill.",
        "Try pairing your salmon with some light, refreshing side dishes.",
        "An array of roasted vegetables like carrots and sweet potatoes taste great with the fillets, as do fresh beans and salad.",
        "Don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t eat your fillets all once.",
        "Instead, put them in a plastic container and refrigerate them for up to 3 days after grilling."
