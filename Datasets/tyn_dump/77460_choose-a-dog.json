There are various benefits and downsides to each. Puppies are adorable, and can grow together with children to form memories and long-lasting friendships. They're also a lot of work at first, and require careful training to make sure they're safe to have around the house when they grow up. You'll have to deal with accidents and high energy, just like with any other baby. An adult  dog may be difficult to break of old bad habits, but they can also come pre-house trained! They are also calmer than puppies, and won't require as much supervision. Elderly dogs will likely have health problems, but they can make wonderful, loving companions for elderly people or those with a sedentary lifestyle. These dogs are least likely to be adopted, so giving a home to an elderly dog would be a great service to an animal in need."

Most of the dogs in animal rescue shelters are hybrids, or \"mutts.\" Getting a dog from a shelter will allow you to help your community by taking responsibility for an unwanted or stray dog. Personnel at the rescue/humane society will usually be able to tell you about the temperaments and behaviors of individual dogs in their care. Even without breed characteristics, you should be able to get a good sense of a dog\u2019s personality. Choose a dog of the right age. The final factor to consider before looking for a dog is whether you want a puppy, an adult dog, or an elderly dog. There are various benefits and downsides to each. Puppies are adorable, and can grow together with children to form memories and long-lasting friendships. They're also a lot of work at first, and require careful training to make sure they're safe to have around the house when they grow up. You'll have to deal with accidents and high energy, just like with any other baby. An adult  dog may be difficult to break of old bad habits, but they can also come pre-house trained! They are also calmer than puppies, and won't require as much supervision. Elderly dogs will likely have health problems, but they can make wonderful, loving companions for elderly people or those with a sedentary lifestyle. These dogs are least likely to be adopted, so giving a home to an elderly dog would be a great service to an animal in need. Meeting and Choosing Your Dog Meet with potential dogs. After you have done your research, you will want to meet with the dog you are considering adopting. Set up an appointment with the breeder or shelter to get to know all of the dogs you're considering. Try to gauge each dog\u2019s personality by playing with it, walking with it, and handling it. To increase your understanding of its personality, spend as much time with the dog as possible. Don't adopt a dog that doesn't feel like a good fit. Be patient and keep looking \u2014 you'll find the right dog for you! Find out the owner\u2019s criteria for making dogs available for adoption. In most states, puppies must be at least 8 weeks old before they can be sold or adopted, though some allow adoptions at 7 weeks. If a breeder or shelter is offering a puppy below 7 or 8 weeks, they are likely not a reputable source for a pet, and should be avoided. If adopting from a shelter, make sure the staff have performed a temperament evaluation before offering a dog for adoption. Ask about each dog's behavior. Breeders and shelter attendants spend a lot of time with the animals in their care. They'll be able to tell you about the individual dog\u2019s personality and behavior. Ask if the dog is friendly or tolerates smaller dog, cats, or other animals. Take what you learn from the dog's caretakers and combine it with your observations of the dog: does it play well, or is it aggressive toward other dogs? Make an initial evaluation of all dogs available for adoption. You may be tempted to stop and interact with the dogs at first, but make yourself observe the dogs from a distance and take notes on which ones stand out to you. On your second pass, visit with the dogs that seemed like good fits on your first pass. Put your hand up to the cage and see how the dog reacts. It should be eager to approach you and sniff your hand. Move your hand slowly back and forth. If the dog does not follow your hand, it may not be well-socialized. Avoid dogs that bark in your face, jump, or lunge at you. Introduce the dog to all members of the household. If you live with others \u2014 even a significant other who visits a lot \u2014 you need to make sure the dog responds well to everyone it will come into contact with. When visiting the dog, bring along other members of the household and see how they interact with it. Does anyone seem turned off by the dog\u2019s personality? Afraid of it? All members of your little \u201cpack\u201d should be excited about the prospect of living together. Take special care to check the dog\u2019s behavior with children. This is especially important if you already have small children in your household, but also crucial if you plan on having children in the future. Remember that a dog might be with you for 15 years or more \u2014 don\u2019t assume that all dogs will simply be able to adjust to the introduction of a child. If you don\u2019t have children, ask a friend to bring their children along with you when you visit. Note that responsible dog-ownership means teaching children how to interact safely with dogs. It\u2019s your job to prevent children from pulling on tails and ears or getting too close to a dog\u2019s mouth. However, notice if the dog is overwhelmed by a child\u2019s loud noises or rapid movements. If not overwhelmed, a dog\u2019s instincts might still be triggered in an unwanted way. For example, herding breeds sometimes nip at running children\u2019s heels, frightening them if not injuring them. Inquire about the dog\u2019s parents. If you are getting a dog from a breeder, they may actually own the parents and allow you to meet them. Most breeders will understand and accommodate such a request. Interacting with the parents will give you a way to gauge what your dog will act like as it grows up because dogs often inherit their parents' personality traits. Set up a temporary foster situation if necessary. If you are unsure about whether a dog is right for you, ask to set up a temporary housing situation. This may be easier if you are adopting from a shelter than if you're buying from a breeder. A shelter may allow you to foster a dog, or even several dogs over a long period of time. This will give you time to get to know your potential pet and figure out if it's a good fit for your home, family, and lifestyle. You should also choose a shelter with a reasonable return policy, in case you cannot keep the dog you adopt. Do not expect to get your adoption fee back if you return the dog, but the shelter should not refuse returns outright. Refusing to accept returned dogs suggests a shelter doesn't care enough about the lives of their animals.",

        "Research each breed\u2019s health needs.",

        "A purebred dog will give you a better sense of what their temperament will be like, since dogs often take after their parents.",
