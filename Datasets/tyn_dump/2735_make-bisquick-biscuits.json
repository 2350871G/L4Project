        "Stir together Bisquick, sugar, and spices.",
        "As noted above, you're looking to simply combine these ingredients loosely in a large bowl \u2014 lots of stirring isn't necessary.",
        "Add apple pieces and cider/juice.",
        "Make a \"well\" with your dry ingredients in the center of your bowl and pour the cider in.",
        "Fold the dry ingredients over the wet center portion just until the entire mixture is moist.",
        "Add the apple pieces all at once and fold the dough several times to incorporate.",
        "If desired, add walnuts.",
        "If you'd like walnuts in your biscuits, add them now, folding the dough several times to incorporate just as you did with the apple pieces.",
        "Drop spoonfuls onto greased cookie sheet.",
        "As above, each spoonful should use about one well-rounded tablespoon of dough, though there is no \"correct\" size.",
        "Bake for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown.",
        "Keep a close eye on your biscuits and be willing to adjust your baking time as needed until you get a crisp texture \u2014 these will usually take slightly longer to cook than the other recipes in this article.",
        "Allow to cool before serving.",
        "Transfer baked biscuits from cookie sheet to a cooling rack.",
        "Biscuits should be ready to eat after about five minutes or when they are cool enough to handle.",
        "For an extra hint of sweetness, sprinkle your biscuits with a pinch or two of sugar before serving.",

        "Mix Bisquick and sour cream.",
        "This recipe is designed to be quick to prepare, to use just a few ingredients, and to be deliciously light and fluffy.",
        "Though the addition of soda may seem odd, the light texture it creates makes these biscuits a favorite for many.",
        "Start by incorporating the Bisquick and sour cream loosely in a bowl.",
        "Stop when you produce a smooth, uniformly moist mixture.",
        "Mix in the soda.",
        "At this point, the dough will be quite soft \u2014 much more so than it would be in the recipes above.",
        "This is normal for this recipe.",
        "Roll and knead the dough.",
        "Note that this step is virtually identical to the equivalent step in the Basic Biscuit recipe above except that the dough is rolled to a slightly greater thickness.",
        "Turn the dough onto surface sprinkled with Bisquick or flour.",
        "Knead the dough about 10 times.",
        "Don't knead excessively \u2014 as with stirring, this can affect the texture of the biscuits.",
        "Roll the dough about one inch thick.",
        "To prevent the dough from sticking to the roller, you can sprinkle it with flour or Bisquick.",
        "Cut the dough into circles about three inches across.",
        "As above, you may use the rim of a glass or jar to get perfect circles if you don't have a cookie cutter.",
        "Pour melted butter into 9x9 inch pan.",
        "Spread evenly along the bottom and sides.",
        "Having a little extra butter is OK. Lay the biscuits over the butter in the pan.",
        "The biscuits may touch each other in the pan.",
        "For this recipe, this is OK \u2014 the biscuits will be especially soft and fluffy at the points where they touch.",
        "Bake for about 8-10 minutes or until golden brown.",
        "Allow to cool and serve.",
        "Allow the biscuits to cool in the pan (you may set the pan on a cooling rack if desired.)",
        "After about 5-10 minutes, use a metal spatula to separate the biscuits along their edges and serve."
