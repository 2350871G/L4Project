A Face with a Mustache Make an outline of the face. Mark the areas where you\u2019ll put the eyes, nose and lips later using horizontal and vertical lines. Sketch the eyebrows, eyes and nose over the outline.  Mark the portion where you will be sketching the lips and mustache using a rectangle.

Do similar steps on the opposite side to make it look symmetrical. Add details to the face like the hair, ears and clothing.  Erase extra lines from the outline for a clean finish and color the drawing.  A Mustache Draw two vertical oblongs. The smaller oblong is at the left end. Draw a reflection of the drawing in step 1 and wherein the bigger oblongs overlap each other.  Draw the cross-sections for each shape.  Draw the curve lines which connect the small oblongs with the bigger ones.  Draw curve lines that connect from the midpoint of the bigger ovals to the upper tip of the small ovals in both sides.  Trace with a pen and erase unnecessary sketches.  Color to your liking to resemble a mustache!  A Face with a Goatee Draw a circle. This will be framework for the head. Draw a straight line from the tip of the circle and extending down and outside it. Draw a rectangle which overlaps about a fourth of the circle and then a trapezoid after that. Draw details for the hair and ears using straight and curve lines.  Draw the curve lines for the neck and shoulders.  Draw details for the man\u2019s face \u2013 eyes, nose, mouth, and brows.
