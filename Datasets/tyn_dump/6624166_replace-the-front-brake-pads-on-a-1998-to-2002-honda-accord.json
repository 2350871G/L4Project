Start on one side of the car and use the tire iron to break loose each lug nut on the tire. You only need to loosen it about an 1/8th of a turn. Be careful not to loosen it more than that. Behind each front tire there is a metal lip (about 5in long) that you can use with the car jack to lift the vehicle. Raise the jack stand so that the pad sits sturdily under the metal lip. Then raise the vehicle just a few inches but not so that the tire is in the air. Continue loosening and removing the lug nuts off the tire, then raise the vehicle so that the tire has at least an inch of clearance above the ground. Place a jack stand under the vehicle's steel frame, behind the car jack. Then lower the car jack until the jack stand is supporting the vehicle. (You may need to raise the vehicle significantly to fit the jack stand under the frame.) Remove the tire, and repeat the process on the other side of the vehicle."
