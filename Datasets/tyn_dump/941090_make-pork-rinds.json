Make sure there is at least a quarter inch (0.6 centimeter) of skin on the meat. Buy at least a pound (420 grams) of pork skin, not including the meat. Use the skin within 3 days of purchase. The high moisture content of pork skin causes it to spoil quickly."

The more fat you remove, the puffier the skins will become. Make sure you always practice good knife safety when handling tough cuts of meat. Pork skin is tough and rubbery. The fat will be soft and easily scraped away. The leftover fat can be rendered into lard or discarded. The meat can be saved for a pork dish."

The pork skins will double in size when fried. Therefore, avoid making excessively large pieces. Wash your hands, knife, and cutting surface after handling raw meat. Consuming raw meat can cause severe illness."
