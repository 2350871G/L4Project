                    "description": "Before you buy a plant from a nursery or gardening store, inspect the plant carefully for signs of mealybugs. Look for small, slow-moving insects that are white or light pink. They tend to feed on the tips of stems where the leaf grows, so look for bites or holes near the base of the leaves. Check the main stem and under the leaves for a cotton-like white mold. If a plant has any of these symptoms, mealybugs may be nesting in it and you should not take it home.Tip: You may not physically see any mealybugs. They burrow in the stems and branches of the plant and the male mealybugs are not visible to the naked eye. There may still be mealybugs on a plant, even if you don\u2019t see them. The white moldy material is excretion from the mealybugs. It\u2019s a trademark sign of a particularly bad infestation."
