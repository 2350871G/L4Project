        "You can save that interior section of mat board to use on other projects.",
        "You could always make another border for a smaller picture, or use it in other crafting projects.",
        "Mounting the Photo and the Mat Use an archival foam core for the mount board.",
        "Using archival-grade material will protect your photo from chemicals that could potentially damage it over time.",
        "Buy this mounting board at your local craft or frame store.",
        "The mount board will sit against the back of the picture frame.",
        "It helps protect the photo and keep it in place so it doesn\u2019t get warped over time.",
        "The \u201cmount board\u201d is the same thing as \u201cfoam core,\u201d and you\u2019ll see these terms used interchangeably on different products.",
        "Cut the mount board to fit inside the frame of your choice.",
        "Just like you did with the mat board, you\u2019ll need to cut the mount board down to size so it\u2019ll fit snuggly in the picture frame.",
        "Use your metal ruler and X-ACTO knife to make your cuts.",
        "It\u2019s really important that the mount board can\u2019t move around in the frame, so take the time to measure and carefully cut.",
        "If it is loose, the picture will get off-center and not look right in the frame.",
        "Attach the picture to the mount board with photo corners.",
        "You can buy these at your local craft store.",
        "Position the picture in the middle of the mat board.",
        "Slip a photo corner over each corner of the picture, remove the adhesive, and press the corner down onto the mat board.",
        "Photo corners make it really easy to remove and switch out the picture in the future.",
        "There\u2019s no adhesive attached to the back of the actual picture, so there is no chance that it could get damaged.",
        "If you decide to just sandwich the picture between the mat board and the mount board, that is called a \u201cfloating mount.\u201d If you do this, make sure there is a firm fit in the frame so that the picture doesn\u2019t come loose and fall down.",
        "Apply a transfer adhesive to the edges of the back of the mat.",
        "Look for an archival-grade adhesive tape.",
        "Most of these come in an easy-to-use dispenser, and you can use it much like you would packing tape.",
        "Line the edges of the mat board on each side with the adhesive.",
        "You can also use: linen hinging tape, press-on mounting tabs, or archival-grade double-sided tape.",
        "Line up the edges of the mat to the mount board and press down firmly.",
        "Be very careful to get the edges of the mat lined up perfectly with the edges of the mount board.",
        "Once it\u2019s in position, firmly run your hands along the edges to secure the 2 pieces together.Tip: Make sure your hands are clean before you press down on the mat.",
        "Insert the matted picture into the frame and hang up the picture.",
        "Position the matted picture so that the picture itself is facing the glass part of the frame.",
        "Put the back of the frame in place and secure it down with the available tabs.",
        "Hang or display your new framed picture and enjoy your handiwork!",
        "If you\u2019re hanging the picture on the wall, make sure to use a level so that it\u2019s perfectly straight."
