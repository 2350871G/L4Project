There are many different kinds of dice you can choose from. Dice with more sides will decrease the odds of repeated numbers. Spinners often use colors to determine player moves.

Your game board is the centerpiece of your board game, so feel free to get creative with the design. Make sure that the path or playing field is clearly marked and that all the instructions on the board are easy to read. Your imagination is the limit when decorating your board. Ready-made printouts, patterned paper, paint, markers, magazine cutouts, and more can be used to jazz up your board. A vibrant, colorful design will be more eye-catching to players. Color is also a great way of setting a mood. A vampire-themed game, for example, would probably be dark and spooky. Game boards are handled frequently and may become worn over time. Protect your hard work by laminating your board when possible. Create the game pieces. The simplest way of doing this is by drawing or printing images on paper and then taping or gluing them to a sturdy backing, like cardstock. If you are making a game for family or friends, you can even use real photos of players. If you want more polished looking game pieces, take your designs to a professional printer and have them printed on thick, high-quality stock. Fit your paper game pieces into plastic game card stands to give them a base. Plastic game card stands can be bought at most hobby stores and general retailers. Try using homemade chess pieces, figurines sculpted from polymer clay, or origami animals for game pieces. Repurpose old dice and spinners or create your own. If your game involves the use of dice or a spinner, you can use ones from store-bought games. Create your own spinner with cardboard, a pushpin, and markers. Stick the pin through the base of a cardboard arrow and attach it to the center of a circular piece of cardboard, then draw the spinner options on the cardboard circle. There are many different kinds of dice you can choose from. Dice with more sides will decrease the odds of repeated numbers. Spinners often use colors to determine player moves. For example, if you spin the arrow and it lands on yellow, your piece would advance to the next yellow square. Spinners are great for prize rounds. If a player draws a prize card or lands on a special square, they could use a spinner to determine their reward. Write out your game cards, when necessary. Plain cards won\u2019t likely capture the interest of players. Use graphics, creative descriptions, and witty one-liners to add some flavor to your deck. For example, a card that skips a player might be accompanied by the image of a jump rope and the text, \u201cLou, Lou, skip to my Lou\u2026\u201d\nCreate your game\u2019s cards using blank playing cards bought at a hobby shop to give your game a high-quality appearance. Homemade game cards can be made from cardstock. Use a normal playing card as a template when cutting so your cards are the same shape. Look into 3D printing to add wow factor. If you really want to make your game stand out, you can look into getting 3D pieces, tokens, and/or boards printed. You will need to submit a 3D model to a company that specializes in this, but the result will be custom models that look like they came from a store-bought game.",
