    "text": " Rich chocolate omelet Crack the eggs and separate the whites and yolks. Whip the egg whites until peaks form. Set aside for use shortly. Place the chocolate and water into a bain-marie or double boiler.  Remove from the heat. Add the egg yolks, beaten egg whites and cream to the melted chocolate. Mix through gently. Melt the butter in the omelet pan. Once melted pour in the first amount of the chocolate batter. Cook over medium heat. Flip halfway through cooking. Repeat to make two to three more omelets.  Serve folded. Place vanilla cream in the center before folding. Chocolate chip omelet Place the egg whites into a bowl. Whisk to combine. Add the yogurt, sugar, vanilla and salt. Whisk in to completely combine. It should be frothy when done. Heat up a skillet or pan on medium heat. You can add a teaspoon of butter or oil if wished but this isn't needed. Preferably, use a non-stick pan. Transfer the omelet batter to the heated skillet or pan. Cook the first side until it's almost done. Flip to the other side. Turn the heat down to low or even off (if electric). Sprinkle the chocolate chips across the omelet, then fold the omelet over. These will melt in. Add sliced bananas or strawberries to the center, if wished. Transfer to the serving plate. Sprinkle with a few more chocolate chips to complete the omelet. Add more fruit for serving with, as wished. Cocoa powder omelet Crack the eggs into the mixing bowl. Add the cocoa powder. Whisk together well. Warm the frying pan or skillet over medium heat. Pour the omelet batter into the warmed pan. Cook the omelet on one side, then flip it over. This will take around 3 to 4 minutes. Sprinkle the chocolate chips or buttons over one side of the cooked omelet. Place under the hot top-down grill or broiler to melt the chocolate slightly. Remove. Serve in slices, to feed two.",
