(Remember to cut of the extra bits and cut a little bit off the tip to straighten it up and it has to be about 1.5 cm thick or thicker). Use a potato peeler to peel off all the bark until the stick is about 1.4 cm thick or a little thicker.  After that, make a small thin mark using a black marker on the place you wish to be as your base. Now use the potato peeler to peel off from the mark making it thinner than the base by about half the base's thickness or thinner. Smooth up the wand using either a penknife or sandpaper, when you're done the base should be about 1.1 cm or less.  Now for the best bit, decorating!
