    "text": " Making a Simple Puree Choose one of the recipes from above. You can also use your own puree, baby food, or healthy smoothie recipe instead. Prepare the ingredients. Wash all of the fruits and vegetables that you will be using. If the fruits have a skin on them, peel them away. Chop up the fruits and vegetables into smaller pieces and remove any seeds. If something needs to be cooked or steamed, take the time to do so. Place the ingredients into the blender. A high-powdered blender will give you the best results. If you can't find one, then a good food processor may also work. Pulse the ingredients until you get a smooth puree. This will take about 1 to 2 minutes. Make sure that there are no chunks, or they may get caught in the nozzle part of the pouch's cap. Adjust the consistency, if needed. You want the puree to be thin enough so that it can easily flow through the nozzle part of the cap without getting stuck. If it is too thick, add in 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 milliliters) of water or juice. Filling the Pouches by Hand Buy some refillable pouches with a zippered opening. If the pouch does not have any sort of zippered or Ziploc opening, then you will have a harder time refilling it. Those kinds will typically need a special filling machine. Remove the cap and blow into the pouch. This puffs the pouch up and makes it easier to fill. You only need to do this for brand-new pouches. Put the cap back on when you are done. Pull open the pouch. Some pouches have little tabs that you can pull apart to open them. If your pouch does not have any sort of zippered opening, then simply leave the cap off.

More formulas will last for 2 to 3 days in the fridge, and 3 months in the freezer. If you need to thaw a frozen formula, simply put it into the fridge the night before. Filling the Pouches with a Machine Purchase a machine meant for refilling food pouches. They often have the words \"squeeze station\" in the title. Some of them can only fill one pouch at a time, while others can fill more. You can buy them online or in a store that has a well-stocked baby section. Purchase some refillable pouches. The pouches that work best for this type of machine are the single-use pouches. Some pouches come with a Ziploc-type top. Those you can refill without the use of a machine. Insert the neck of the pouch into the machine. How you do this depends on the type of machine you bought. Usually, there will be an opening at the bottom of the machine, below the filling canister.
