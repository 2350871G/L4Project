                    "description": "A good Beyblade stadium needs a smooth playing surface with an even, convex center. While there is no official size for a Beyblade stadium, most stadiums are roughly 12\u201324 inches (30\u201361 cm) in diameter. Use a round, plastic plate or flip a large frisbee over to use it as a simple playing surface. Most Beyblade stadiums are round, but you can use a square-shaped playing surface as long as it angles down towards the center. Frisbees make for great playing surfaces because they have built-in rails around the edges. They will also wobble a little, even after adding walls, which will add another layer of complexity to your Beyblade games. Do not use a ceramic or glass plate. Beyblades spin on a thin point, and the pressure and friction from a spinning Beyblade could shatter the glass or ceramic."

                    "description": "If you want a heftier playing surface, use a frying pan or metal wok. Clean a pan out with warm water and dish soap, and then inspect the surface for dents or debris. The steeper the angle in the middle of your pot or wok, the faster your Beyblade games will end, so choose a pot or wok with a decline that you\u2019re comfortable with.Tip: Using a frying pan or wok has the advantage of coming with built-in walls that don\u2019t require any additional construction. This makes frying pans or woks excellent replacements for a stadium if you\u2019re in a rush. If you use a pan with a handle, you can use the handle as a center-court indicator in your games. This will make it easy to tell where each player has to start spinning their Beyblades."

Use different colors every time that you replace the playing surface to change the way it looks! You can trim the edges with scissors to your desired length or fold them over the side.
