If you are using printer paper, it should be 8 \u00be\" x 11 \u00bd\" (22.2 x 31 cm). Fold six sheets of paper in half. Then, sew them together at the crease in a figure-8 pattern. Make sure you start and end at the same point and the knot faces inside. This will create a spine. 1/4\" (0.6 cm) is an adequate width. Stack several of these six-sheet stacks on top of each other. Make sure they are properly aligned. Press them down between some heavy books and measure the width of the spine. Once they are flattened, sew the stacks together using the same formation. Cut a strip of fabric. It should be as long as the pages and \u00be\" (2 cm) wider than the spine. Coat one side of the fabric with glue. Use plenty, but not so much that it drips. Stick the fabric to the spine of the pages. Pull it tight. Run a ruler along it to smooth out any bubbles. Place the book between sheets of wax paper and underneath a heavy book or two.

        "This will be the back cover.",
        "The \u00bd\" (1.25 cm) gap in the cardboard that you cut out previously will be the \"hinge\" that makes the book open and open easily.",
        "Apply the glue to the paper if you're using wrapping paper (or other thin, pretty paper).",
        "This prevents wrinkling and swelling and gives the paper time to get used to the moisture in the glue before application on the cardboard.",

        "Fold in the sides.",

        "Once the corners are folded, start on the sides.",
        "Folding the corners first creates a geometrical, stream-lined fold.",

        "Hole punch two holes into the binding.",
        "Depending on what and how many materials you use, this could be very easy or very difficult.",
        "They should be about 1 \u00bd\" (3.8 cm) from either edge.",
        "If you don't have a hole punch (and preferably a single hole punch), you can use a drill.",
        "But before you drill a hole into the table, place it onto something you're comfortable drilling into, like a phone book.",
        "If you do use a drill, place the covers inside out so that the rough edges are on the inside.",
        "Use bull clips to hold everything together.",
        "Thread a ribbon through the holes using the Japanese bookbinding method.",
        "The ribbon should be six times longer than the book is tall.",
