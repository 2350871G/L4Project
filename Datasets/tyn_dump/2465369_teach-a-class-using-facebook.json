For older children, have them comment about their opinions on a reading assignment to check whether they have completed it. By giving the students a deadline to comment and/or some time in the computer lab, you can check who has been doing their required reading. Post reminders about upcoming homework assignments or tests. This will encourage students to check back often, and it may increase the number of completed assignments. Start a \"word of the day\" or \"link of the day\" feature on your group. Post something that is relevant to that week's class and discuss it at the beginning or end of class. This is a great way to supplement a textbook, because you can reference modern issues and other sources. Ask students to post excerpts from their reports on the group. Give them a deadline to post a photo of their subject and an introductory paragraph. This will allow students to share knowledge. Arrange a Facebook salon. After a big assignment or test, ask students to have discussions online about what they have read. They can be required to comment on 5 or 10 things in a constructive manner over the course of a week. Ask students in a foreign language class to comment in the new language. Students are likely to study harder and perfect what they will say if everyone will see it."
