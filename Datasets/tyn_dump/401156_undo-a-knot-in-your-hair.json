Don't use a brush, as this can lead to more knotting. Instead, find a sturdy medium- or wide-toothed comb. Set up a chair in front of a mirror--you'll want to be sitting, since it may take a while. There's an abundance of detangling products for curly-haired people. Look for sprays to use after the shower, plus rinses and shampoos that can help when you wash your hair. Look for gentle, no-tears versions for kids or very fine hair. If your hair is dry and damaged, look for a product that moisturizes as it detangles. You can also use a silicone-based de-frizzing gel to work out tangles. Make your own spray by mixing conditioner and water in a clean, empty spray bottle."

                    "description": "Many experts recommend detangling right after you shower, but it depends on how healthy your hair is to begin with. Wet hair is stretchy and elastic, but also extremely fragile, so it will break very easily. However, damp hair can add lubrication, which can assist in loosening the knot. If your hair is very damaged or fragile, begin with dry hair. The spray or conditioner will add lubrication and \"slip\" to dry hair, which is often sufficient for working out a knot. Some experts recommend detangling right before you shower, so you can easily work shampoo and conditioner through your hair and comb it out afterwards."

The knot should be free from the clips with everything else pulled out of the way. If you have a ton of tangles, it will be much easier for you to work in sections. Try dividing your hair into about six sections and work on them one at a time. If you're working through all your hair, make sure you separate the finished sections from those that are still knotted. You may want to braid the finished section so it doesn't tangle again."

You'll be surprised how far you can get de-tangling using this method. Feeling the knot with your hands can give you a better idea of what you're working against, like the size and how tightly the strands are knotted.

Be very, very gentle when combing through the knot. If you tug and break your hair, those damaged and broken strands will only create future tangles.
