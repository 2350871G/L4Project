You can wash them in your sink inside or outside with a garden hose. If there is stubborn dirt on your rocks, it might not come off just with water. Hold the rock under water and use either your hand or an old toothbrush to rub the dirt off. Don't use soaps or solvents on your rocks \u2014 they can break down the structure of your rock."

For example, simple geometric shapes like hearts, stars, squares, circles, or triangles work well. You can also combine simple shapes into a larger pattern. For example, you could begin with a ring along the edge of the rock, and move toward the center of the rock, creating a ring of circles, followed by a ring of hearts, and then another solid ring."
