To ensure that your deck ends up with a uniform appearance after staining, pick out a type of lumber with a similar color, texture, and grain pattern. If your deck is need of more extensive repairs, it may be a good idea to hire a contractor to come out and fix it up.Tip: Pull up loose nails and sink deck screws in their place.
