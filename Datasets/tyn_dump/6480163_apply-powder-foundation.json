Most people use a rounded kabuki brush, which you can purchase at most department stores, to apply powder foundation. However, if you're applying powder foundation on top of a liquid or cream foundation, you may want to use a rounded foundation brush. The coverage with these kinds of brushes is usually more sheer. You should also keep in mind how thick of a brush you want, regardless of whether you're using a foundation brush or a kabuki brush. If you want fuller coverage, use a thicker brush.

If you have any pimples or acne, cover these areas with a light dusting of powder foundation. Go slowly when applying foundation. Applying foundation in a rush can cause it to smear.
