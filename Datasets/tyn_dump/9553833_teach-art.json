        "For example, you could give affirmations like \u201cWow, the shapes you chose look really great together!\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re doing a great job at staying focused.\u201d\nIf you notice that a student has drawn something unusual or out of scale, such as a person with huge feet, you could ask them something like \u201cCan you tell me more about the feet?\u201d Asking them to elaborate can give you a better idea of how they observe and translate observation to paper.",
        "Teaching a High School Art Class Plan out your lessons in advance to introduce new ideas and skills.",
        "Whether you plan weeks in advance or the night before class, you should always have a schedule prepared for class time.",
        "Include several basic elements in each lesson plan, such as an opening warm-up, a short review session, and the main assignment.",
        "Use an opening warm-up or ritual to help the students focus their attention and warm up, such as a few minutes of quiet contour drawing or sketching.",
        "Include a short review session at the beginning of each lesson to remind students of what they\u2019ve learned already.",
        "During this time, ask students if they have any questions about previous lessons or techniques.",
        "The main assignment should take up the bulk of the class time.",
        "Start by introducing any new techniques that students will need to complete the assignment, then explain the assignment details before letting students begin working on it.",
        "Incorporate skills that students will use later in life.",
        "Emphasize basic design principles, such as balance and composition, and the importance of having a foundational knowledge of art.",
        "If your students plan to attend college or enter the job market, they\u2019ll benefit immensely from a background in art history or artistic skills.",
        "Other important basic artistic skills include working with lines, shapes, colors, values, and textures.",
        "For example, your students will need a solid background in design principles for a college degree in graphic design, interior design, or visual communications.",
        "They could also apply these skills in the workplace when designing a logo, making promotional brochures, or creating visually compelling emails.",
        "Ground your lessons by touching on some art history.",
        "Whether you include some art history in every class period or dedicate a single class period to it, this side of art is crucial to creating a well-rounded class experience.",
        "To incorporate art history into your course, match an iconic art movement with the lessons you\u2019ll be teaching.",
        "Summarize the style, its most popular artists, and its historical significance.",
        "For example, you could introduce pop art with a lesson on color theory or portraiture.",
        "You could pair a section on abstract art with a lesson on how to create balance in a composition.",
        "Incorporate hands-on projects in each class.",
        "This is a great way to keep students engaged and help them progress in skill.",
        "Explain the project, then let your students practice the techniques you\u2019ve explained.",
        "Walk around the room, giving encouragement and correcting any major mistakes to help students get back on track.",
        "For example, you could set up a still life in the classroom with a bowl of fruit or a series of glass bottles.",
        "Have students draw, paint, or photograph the scene in class to hone their skills.",
        "Assign homework each week.",
        "This could be a project to work on outside of class, a journal for recording inspiration, or special challenges for students to complete each day.",
        "Having regular homework outside of classwork will help students retain information and learn how to practice these skills on their own.",
        "For pottery classes, you could have students sketch their favorite mugs in detail.",
        "For a drawing class, assign blind contours and action poses to let students practice and get used to the feeling of drawing.",
        "Plan field trips to introduce students to fine art and inspiration.",
        "Excursions to art museums, studios, and galleries can be a great way to expose students to new styles and get them excited about art.",
        "Observation is key to developing a critical eye and an appreciation for art.",
        "To get more hands-on, you could arrange for a tour or a presentation with a local artist.",
        "You could also include an assignment with the trip, such as a paragraph on their favorite piece.",
        "Give encouraging feedback as well as 1-2 suggestions for improvement.",
        "Each teacher grades differently, but encouragement is key for keeping your students working hard.",
        "Give feedback for each assignment students turn in and limit your corrections to 1 or 2 suggestions.",
        "Encourage students' creativity above all!",
        "For example, when giving feedback on an abstract piece, you could say, \"Your sense of balance and composition is really strong.",
        "You've done a great job with this project.",
        "My only note is that contrasting colors could add a little more interest to the piece\u2014try out some complementary colors next time and see what you think.\"",
        "If you do class critiques, make sure to affirm your students on what they did well and keep things positive.",
        "Remember that feedback can be nerve-wracking, especially in front of the whole class!",
        "Instructing a Workshop for Adults Choose a simple, fun project that can be completed in about an hour.",
        "Plan out your full project beforehand, taking care to choose a subject that will look good and be fairly easy to replicate.",
        "Break the project down, step by step, to create a simple process for the class to follow.",
        "Make sure to bring your reference, whether a photograph or your own painting, to class for students to follow.",
        "Simple but beautiful scenes in nature are often favorites for painting workshops.",
        "You could choose a scene such as a boat on a lake at sunset, for instance.",
        "Plan out your time so students can finish a full piece of artwork.",
        "Satisfaction is a huge part of having fun with art, and ending the class with an unfinished piece of artwork can be incredibly unsatisfying for students.",
        "Practice the painting and make sure that it will suit the length of the class.",
        "Then plan out your time efficiently, taking into account different students\u2019 paces and abilities.",
        "This way, they\u2019ll feel accomplished and have something to take home and show their family.",
        "This is one of the best ways to spread the word about your class.",
        "Include some technical skills to make the class informative and fun.",
        "Along with encouraging creativity and play, you should teach some new skills in the workshop.",
        "Incorporate some basic techniques into each project and demonstrate the technique to the class before starting the project.",
        "For example, if you\u2019re teaching a watercolor workshop, you could teach dry brush and spatter techniques by painting subjects like a waterfall or a rainy street.",
        "You could also encourage your students to keep a \u201ccheat sheet\u201d of notes as they learn new skills.",
        "Create a relaxed, social environment.",
        "Adult art workshops are generally more socially focused.",
        "Oftentimes, a \u201cpaint and pour\u201d format with some instruction and complimentary wine works well for workshops.",
        "Workshops should feel less structured than classes, giving the adults time to socialize as well as instruction.",
        "For example, you could periodically demonstrate each step on your own easel at the front of the class, and then give everyone enough time to work on that step and talk to each other.",
        "To create a calm, inviting environment, you could also set up the easels in a circle and have some relaxed, warm lighting.",
        "Provide the art supplies if the class is for beginners.",
        "New students likely won\u2019t have any supplies of their own, so make sure to provide the supplies each student will need to complete a project.",
        "Figure the cost of the supplies into the price of the workshop and have all the supplies set up when the students arrive.",
        "For example, painting workshops should have an easel, paints, canvas or paper, brushes, and jars of water for each person.",
        "Pottery classes may need clay, water, sponges, shaping tools, and wheels, depending on the techniques used.",
        "You can either let the students take the supplies home or keep the supplies to use for future workshops.",
        "Keep the class size small so you can focus on each student.",
        "When you start teaching workshops, you should start small and expand as you gain experience.",
        "Start with 2-3 students and learn how to balance one-on-one time for questions with class demonstration time.",
        "As you continue teaching and find that you can handle more students, add more slots to your classes.",
        "Generally, you should limit your classes to a maximum of 10 people.",
        "Give lots of encouragement and affirmation.",
        "By the time they reach adulthood, most people believe they are not \u201cartistic.\u201d It\u2019s important to give your students confidence in their abilities and the progress they\u2019ve made by affirming them.",
        "Compliment them on the techniques they get right during the creative process and when they\u2019ve finished their project.",
        "For example, you could say \u201cYour brushstrokes here are perfect\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019ve done a great job at capturing the shadows.\u201d\nMake sure to also emphasize that there is no competition or comparison in the workshop.",
        "Let people work at their own pace and remind everyone that there is no right or wrong way to approach the creative process."
