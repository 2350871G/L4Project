This will connect the USB WiFi adapter to your computer's USB port. The antenna is directional, so you'll need to position it so it has a direct line of sight view of the wireless access point. Make sure your cable is long enough to position it where you need, up to a maximum of 15 feet (4.6 m) (5m). You can link multiple extension cables together if you need. Active USB extenders (~$10USD) allow further cable runs, which may even allow elevated outdoor antenna placement."
