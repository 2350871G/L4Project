Silicone based adhesives are transparent and strong once dry, but can be toxic. Aquarium glues fall under this category. Ultraviolet (UV) curing acrylic resins are excellent for repairing clear glass fragments that fit snugly together. They require exposure to sunlight or a UV lamp to set. Opaque or colored glass may block some of the UV light, causing a weaker bond. If you are repairing an object that will be exposed to water, make sure the glue is waterproof. Most silicone adhesives and some UV resins are waterproof. If you are repairing an object that will come into contact with food or drink, check that the glue used is made for this purpose. Some adhesives are toxic even when dry."

A few minutes in direct, bright sunlight or under a UV lamp should harden the glue. Allow more time for opaque glass or less intense sunlight. Silicone based glues require several hours at least to set. They do not require sunlight and will set in most weather conditions (5%\u201395% humidity; 40\u00ba\u2013100\u00baF=5\u00ba-40\u00baC).
