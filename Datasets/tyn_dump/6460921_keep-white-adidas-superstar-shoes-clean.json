Dab the excess repellant with a soft towel, and allow it to dry overnight. When the repellant dries, add a second coat. This should help prevent moisture and most minor stains from damaging your shoes. You can buy water and stain repellant at your local shoe store. Re-apply the repellant every few weeks as you would with winter boots."
