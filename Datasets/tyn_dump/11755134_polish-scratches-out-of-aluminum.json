Cover up any sensitive or delicate parts of the aluminum object that you don\u2019t want to accidentally scratch or get polishing compound on during the polishing process.Warning: Never attempt to polish aluminum that has a special coating or you will just damage the item even more. For example, an aluminum pan with a non-stick coating. Check the manufacturer\u2019s specifications in the owner\u2019s manual or online if you aren\u2019t sure whether something has a coating. For example, if you want to polish scuffs out of something like an aluminum stove or fridge, you might want to mask off things like control panels if they are near the scratched area. This method works for very minor scuffs and scratches. Keep in mind that you won\u2019t be able to get the aluminum looking like it is straight out of the factory, but you will be able to hide the scuffs and shine up the metal. You\u2019ll get the best results using this method if you polish the entire aluminum surface, not just the scuffed area, so that the finish looks uniformly shiny when you\u2019re done. However, if the scuffed area isn\u2019t too conspicuous, such as in a corner of an aluminum stove door, you can just polish the scuff marks out and blend it in to the surrounding metal as much as possible."

Rub it back and forth over the area using slow controlled motions until the scuff marks disappear and the metal starts to look shiny.Most aluminum has a unidirectional grain, which are actually brush marks caused by the original polishing process that the aluminum went through. Never rub the scouring pad across this grain or you might end up making the scuffs worse. If the aluminum item you want to polish doesn\u2019t have a visible grain, just pick a direction to rub the scouring pad in and only move it back and forth in this direction. Don\u2019t change directions or move it in circular motions or you might just create more scuff marks. Scouring pads are also known as buffing pads. The finer the git, the better for this job. You can get a fine-grit scouring pad at an auto detail supply shop."

You can use this method to sand and polish out curb damage on an aluminum car wheel or bicycle crank shaft, for example. Since you\u2019ll be actually removing a layer of metal using this method, the final results will look best if you sand and polish the entire aluminum object, not just the scratched part. For instance, if you want to polish scratches out of the face of an aluminum wheel, sand the entire wheel down."

Press the sandpaper firmly against the scratched area and move it back and forth over the scratches in alternating directions until they disappear.Warning: Don\u2019t ever use sandpaper that is coarser than 220-grit on aluminum as it will just create more deep scratches in the metal. Keep in mind that if there are very deep dents and gouges in the aluminum, you won\u2019t be able to polish them out completely by sanding. However, you can at least make them less visible and restore shine to the surrounding surface. Make sure that the sandpaper you used is labelled as safe for wet sanding. Most fine-grit sandpaper is OK to use for wet sanding, but double-check the packaging or the back of the paper to be sure. Wear safety glasses and a dust mask when you sand metal, especially if you are using a powerful electric sander."

For example, something between 2000-grit and 2500-grit. If there is no more WD-40 left on the aluminum by this stage, spray a little directly onto the sandpaper to lubricate it for this last round of sanding.
