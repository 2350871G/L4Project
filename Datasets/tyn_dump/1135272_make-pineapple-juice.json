                    "description": "If your pineapple is under ripe it will be sour. If it is overripe, it may be way too sweet. Picking the right pineapple is the most important step for making delicious pineapple juice. Smell the pineapple. A sweet scent is generally considered the most important aspect of choosing a ripe pineapple. If it has no scent, it's not ripe. Avoid pineapples that smell fermented. Although you want the pineapple to smell sweet, you do not want it to be so ripe that the sweet smell has an alcoholic or vinegar-like taint to it. Look at the pineapple's color. It will often reflect a golden-yellow color, but a green pineapple is not necessarily unripe. Be aware that some pineapples are considered ripe when green. Place more emphasis on the pineapple's healthy appearance. Avoid pineapples with wrinkled skin, reddish-brown skin, cracks or leaks, mold, or brown withering leaves. You want the pineapple to be firm, but soft enough that it gives very slightly when you press down on it. While you can use frozen or canned pineapple, fresh pineapples usually produce a better tasting juice."

You can use the remaining center leaves to hold the pineapple steady as you cut it. Some cooks suggest cutting the entire top off.

Continue cutting from the top diagonal line to the bottom diagonal line, creating long parallel grooves in the pineapple\u2019s flesh. It will start to look like a spiral.
