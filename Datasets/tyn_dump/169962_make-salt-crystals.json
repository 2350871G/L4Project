Once you see little crystals on the string, those will usually keep growing bigger and bigger over the next couple weeks. When the water cools, it has way more salt than cold water can normally hold. This makes it very unstable, so the dissolved salt will leave the water and grab onto the string if it gets a tiny push. As the water evaporates, the salt stays behind, making it even more unstable and encouraging the crystal to grow. This is because the crystal is in a lower energy state, which makes it more stable than the salt was in the solution."

        "Try alum or table salt instead, or see variations below for more ideas.",
        "Choose a seed crystal.",
        "Once the crystals are ready, pour out the liquid and look at the crystals.",
        "Pick them up and examine them with a pair of tweezers.",
        "Select a \"seed crystal\" that will form the core of your new, larger one.",
        "Look for crystals that fit this description (from most to least important):\nChoose a lone crystal, not in contact with any others.",
        "Choose a crystal with flat, even surfaces and straight edges.",
        "Choose a large crystal (at least the size of a pea).",
        "Ideally, find several crystals and set each one up in a separate jar as described below.",
        "Crystals often dissolve or fail to grow, so having backups is a good idea.",
        "Attach fishing line or smooth wire.",
        "Super glue this to one side of the crystal, or tie it around the crystal.",
        "Do not use string or rough wire.",
        "You need a smooth surface so the crystals can't grow on the string instead of the crystal.",
        "Create a new solution.",
        "Select distilled water and the same type of salt.",
        "This time, warm the water only slightly above room temperature.",
        "The goal is to make a perfectly saturated solution.",
        "An under-saturated solution may dissolve your crystal, while an over-saturated solution will cover the crystal in salt grains and cause a lumpy mass to grow.",
        "There are several faster ways to solve this problem, but they are more difficult and may require some knowledge of chemistry.",
        "Add the crystal and solution to a clean container.",
        "Clean a jar, then rinse thoroughly with distilled water.",
        "Pour the new solution into this jar, then hang the crystal into the center.",
        "Store it as follows:\nPlace the jar in a cool, dark location, such as in a low cupboard.",
        "Keep it on a Styrofoam pad or other material that absorbs vibration.",
        "Keep a coffee filter, paper, or thin cloth over the jar to block dust.",
        "Do not use an airtight seal.",
        "Check on the crystal regularly.",
        "The crystal will grow more slowly this time, since a little water will need to evaporate before the salt grains are forced to attach to the crystal.",
        "If everything works out, the crystal will keep the same shape as it grows.",
        "You can take it out whenever you like, but it will most likely keep growing for several weeks.",
        "About every two weeks, pour the solution through a coffee filter to remove impurities.",
        "This is a difficult process.",
        "Even experienced crystal growers sometimes have a crystal dissolve or become lumpy.",
        "If you have a perfect seed crystal, you might want to test a worse seed crystal first to make sure the solution works out.",
        "Protect the finished crystal with nail polish.",
        "Once your crystal is large enough, remove it from the solution and dry it.",
        "Brush a coat or clear nail polish onto all sides to prevent it wearing apart over time.",
        "Trying Different Variations Try different substances.",
        "There are many substances that will crystallize using the techniques above.",
        "You can buy many of them from chemical supply stores.",
        "Here are a few options:\n\nBorax for white or dyed crystals\nCopper sulfate for blue crystals\nChrome alum for purple crystals\nCopper acetate monohydrate for dark, blue-green crystals\n\nWarning: These chemicals may cause harm when inhaled, ingested, or handled with bare hands.",
        "Read the safety information on the label and do not allow children to handle them unsupervised.",
        "Make a snowflake.",
        "Tie several pipe cleaners or rough wires together in a star shape.",
        "Lower these into your salt solution, and watch small crystals coat the star and turn it into a sparkling snowflake.",
        "Create a crystal garden.",
        "Instead of making a single crystal, why not create a cupful?",
        "Make your salt solution, then pour over cut up sponges or charcoal briquettes in the base of the container.",
        "Stir in a little vinegar, and watch crystal formations grow overnight.",
        "Pour enough to saturate the sponges without submerging them.",
        "To make different colors of crystals, add a drop of food coloring to each sponge."
