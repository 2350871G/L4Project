Make sure the TV is visible from different angles. Also, keep in mind the location of nearby power outlets.Mount the TV to an interior wall. It has to be done on a wall containing support beams, since a TV won\u2019t stay attached to bare plaster. To test the positioning, cut a piece of paper or cardboard and tape it to the wall.

The lath will be nailed to the studs, so you can detect the metal nails to pinpoint the location of the studs. Another way to do this is to buy a rare-earth magnet and hold it against the wall to see where it sticks. If you knock against the wall, the areas with studs will produce a higher-pitched sound.
