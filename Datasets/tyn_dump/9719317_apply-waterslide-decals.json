Choose a color of nail polish or a clear coat and brush it onto each of your nails. Allow your nails to dry fully before moving onto the next step. Cut out your nail decals with scissors and choose one for your first nail.

Applying Decals to Ceramics Make or buy a clean glazed ceramic item. Choose (or make) an item that you would like to decorate. You could use a plate, bowl, coffee mug, vase, or any other piece of ceramic. You just want to make sure the item is complete, glazed, and clean. The glaze on your ceramic will allow your decals to have a smooth surface to stick to. Cut your decals to the shape you want them with scissors. Using scissors, trim your decals to the size and shape that you\u2019d like them to appear on the ceramic. Soak your decals for 30 to 60 seconds each in water. Set your first decal into a bowl of water. The paper backing begins to fall off the decals in 30 to 60 seconds. Be ready to move the decal right away onto your ceramic when the paper backing falls off. Place the decal onto your ceramic. Using your fingers, place the decal onto your ceramic in the area where you would like it. Slide it to exactly where you would like it before beginning the next step. Blot your decal with a paper towel or sponge. To remove any excess water or air bubbles, blot the decal carefully with a sponge or paper towel. Begin where the bubble is and press gently, working toward the closest edge to get the water or air bubble out. Repeat steps 3-5 for any other decals you\u2019re using on this ceramic. Before you let the decals dry, put any other decals that you want to include on the ceramic. Some ceramic decals come in sets, such as a ring of leaves and flowers. Place all decals onto this item starting with the soak process. Allow your ceramic to dry for 24 hours. Once there are no water or air bubbles under the decal, allow the ceramic to sit out and dry for 24 hours. This will allow the decal to fully stick to your surface. Fire your ceramic in a kiln at 015 to 04. To be able to use your ceramic without having the decal wash off in water, you will want to fire your ceramic in a kiln at the setting appropriate for the decal you used.
