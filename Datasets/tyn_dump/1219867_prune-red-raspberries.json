For most varieties, the canes tend to produce on an every-other-year schedule. In its first year, the cane will focus on growing. The second year is when the mature cane yields fruit. So, if your version of pruning is to mow everything down to a few inches off the ground every fall, you could be hurting, not helping, your berry production. After the cane produces fruit, the cane dies. The plant produces a new cane for every cane that dies."

Since all cane in the patch compete for food and light, thinning out raspberry patches by removing the dead and weak canes will allow the other canes to grow strong and give them enough space to produce a bountiful crop."
