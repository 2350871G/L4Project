        "A typical package of candy melts contains about 12 to 16 ounces (340 to 452 g) of wafers.",
        "If your package is larger than that, measure out 12 to 16 ounces (340 to 452 g), and start with that.",
        "This method is ideal for large amounts of candy melts, between 3.5 and 5 pounds (1.6 and 2.3 kg), or 3.5 to 5 bags.",
        "You will be adding more candy melts into the slow cooker later.",
        "Turn the slow cooker onto a LOW heat setting.",
        "Never use a high heat setting, as this will cause the candy to burn.",
        "The key to melting the candy perfectly is to use a low, slow heat.",
        "Make sure that your slow cooker is on a heat-safe surface, such as tile or marble.",
        "Allow the wafers to melt for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
        "How long it takes for the wafers to melt will vary a little each time, but expect it to take about 20 minutes.",
        "Use a rubber spatula to stir the candy every so often to help it melt faster.",
        "Do not get impatient and turn the heat up.",
        "The candy will burn.",
        "Add a second package of candy melts and stir it until it melts.",
        "This second batch shouldn't take as long to melt as the first batch.",
        "Expect this batch to take anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes.",
        "Be sure to scrape the bottom of the slow cooker.",
        "This will ensure that everything melts evenly.",
        "Continue to add bags of candy melts until you get your desired amount.",
        "Wait for each batch to melt before adding another bag.",
        "Plan on using between 3.5 and 5 bags of candy melts total.",
        "As you add more batches of candy, they will melt faster and faster.",
        "Switch the slow cooker to a WARM setting, then use the candy as desired.",
        "This setting will keep the candy in a fluid state without actually overheating it.",
        "This is perfect for projects like cake pops.",
        "If you wish to use the candy to fill molds or drizzle over things, you can turn the slow cooker off.",
        "Use a spoon or sauce ladle to scoop the melted candy up and drizzle it over treats.",
        "You can also use a spoon or sauce ladle to pour the candy into molds.",
        "Coloring, Flavoring, and Thinning Candy Melts Add colored wafers to a batch of white wafers to create pastel shades.",
        "Empty a bag of white wafers into your bowl, pan, or slow cooker, then add a handful of colored wafers.",
        "Melt the candy as desired, then add in more colored wafers until you get the shade you want.",
        "Colored candy melts are vibrant, so it's easier to color a batch of white wafers with a few colored ones than the other way around.",
        "Mix 2 or more colors to create a new color.",
        "Candy melts come in all sorts of colors, but if you want a specific color, like blue-green or red-orange, you will have to mix it yourself.",
        "Simply add a little bit of each color (not the entire bag) into your bowl, pot, or slow cooker, then melt it as directed.",
        "Check the manufacturer's website; sometimes they post color combinations.",
        "Use oil-based food coloring and white wafers as an alternative.",
        "Use a toothpick or skewer to pick up a drop of oil-based food coloring, then dip it into the melted candy.",
        "Stir it in with a rubber spatula.",
        "Add more drops until you get the color you want.",
        "Do not use liquid food coloring, or the candy will seize.",
        "You can find oil-based food coloring in the baking section of a craft store.",
        "Flavor candy melts with oil-based candy flavoring, if desired.",
        "Melt the wafers using 1 of the methods above, then stir in 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of oil-based candy flavoring.",
        "Do not use regular extracts, as these are water-based and will cause the candy to seize.",
        "You can find oil-based candy flavoring in the baking section of a craft store.",
        "A dram is the same thing as a bottle.",
        "Candy melts taste like vanilla on their own.",
        "Candy flavoring can give more unique flavors, like strawberry.",
        "Stir in 1 teaspoon of shortening if the candy melts are too thick.",
        "The melted wafers should be thin enough to drip off a spoon like honey.",
        "Sometimes, however, the melted candy is too thick to do that, even after it's been melted.",
        "If that happens, stir in 1 teaspoon of shortening for every 12 to 16 ounces (340 to 452 g) of candy melts.",
        "If you put the candy into a plastic bag, open the bag first, then add the shortening.",
        "Close the bag, and massage the shortening in.",
        "For plastic bottles, add the shortening into the bottle, then stir it in with a skewer."
