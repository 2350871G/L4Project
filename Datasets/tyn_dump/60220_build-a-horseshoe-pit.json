        "The idea behind making the pits slightly deeper than the width of the boards is to allow the frame to sit just below the playing surface.",
        "A deeper hole will help keep the sand confined inside the pit.",
        "Lower the frames into the pits.",
        "If you followed the dimensions of the outlines carefully while digging, the frames should fit perfectly.",
        "All that\u2019s left to do now is install the stakes, fill in the empty space, and add any other accessories you want to include.",
        "Adding the Finishing Touches Drive a metal stake into the center of each pit.",
        "Position the stakes 36 inches (91 cm) from the front edge of the frames and sink them to a depth of 21\u201322 inches (53\u201356 cm) using a sledgehammer.",
        "According to NHPA guidelines, 14\u201315 inches (36\u201338 cm) of the stake should remain exposed above the ground.",
        "However, this is only important if you\u2019re intent on building a regulation pit.",
        "If you\u2019re only going to be playing recreationally, a height of anywhere from 6\u201312 inches (15\u201330 cm) will work just fine.",
        "After driving the stakes, jostle them to make sure they\u2019re set firmly in the ground\u2014the last thing you want is for them to come loose in the middle of a game!",
        "The stakes in NHPA pits are also sometimes tilted forward at roughly a 12-degree angle.",
        "If you want your pits to be up to regulation, use a ruler to form a triangle between the stake and the playing surface.",
        "The end of the stake should hit the ruler at the 12 in (30 cm) mark.",
        "If you want to make your horseshoe pit more or less permanent, consider pouring a concrete base around each stake.",
        "The process will require extra time and labor, but it will result in a much more stable stake.",
        "Line the pits with landscaping cloth to prevent shifting (optional).",
        "Cut a roll of landscaping cloth into 2 36 in (91 cm) x 48 in (120 cm) sheets and smooth a sheet over the bottom of both pits.",
        "While this step isn\u2019t absolutely necessary, it can be useful for keeping the sand from sifting into the cracks in the dirt below as it settles.",
        "You can find landscaping cloth at any hardware store or home improvement center, or in the lawn and garden section of most superstores.",
        "Fill in the pits with sand.",
        "Snip the corner off a bag of sand and make your way around the pit sifting the sand from corner to corner in a spiral pattern.",
        "Continue in this fashion until the sand is level with the tops of the frames, using as many bags as needed to completely fill the pits.",
        "Once they\u2019re topped off, pat the sand with the back of a shovel or trample it underfoot to flatten it down.",
        "If you prefer, you could also fill your pits with packed soil or blue clay.",
        "Sand and clay are generally considered the best play surfaces for horseshoes, as they help minimize bouncing, skipping, and sliding.",
        "Fashion backboards for the pits to stop stray horseshoes (optional).",
        "To build a simple backboard, line up 3 of the 3 ft (0.91 m) 2x6 pieces you cut earlier along the center of a 2 ft (0.61 m) 2x2 board and fasten them on the backside using deck screws.",
        "Then, align the backboard with the pit stake and drive or bury the foot so that the 2x6 piece are flush with the ground.",
        "If you want to give your backboards a little more heft to ensure that they don\u2019t move, use landscape timber instead of ordinary lumber.",
        "Backboards won\u2019t be necessary for most home pits, but they can come in handy if you don\u2019t want to have to chase after your horseshoes, or if there are objects nearby that could accidentally be damaged by a missed throw.",
        "Spray paint foul lines around each pit using.",
        "Draw the foul lines in a square or rectangle extending from the front edge of each pit.",
        "Remember, the throwing line should be 27\u201337 feet (8.2\u201311.3 m) away from the stake, according to official NHPA rules.",
        "The sidelines will be the same width as the pit itself, and are there to make it easier to spot throws that go out-of-bounds.",
        "If you don\u2019t like the idea of spray painting your lawn, come up with another way to mark the foul lines.",
        "For example, you might place a series of colored stakes at each of the corners, or simply lay down a stick to serve as a makeshift throwing line."
