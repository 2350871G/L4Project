Adjust the edges of the hole so that the loose fibers are facing the back side. Groom these carefully so that they lie flat on the back side of the canvas.

If the canvas has exposed raw edges where it\u2019s been stapled onto on the back side of the frame, use the thickness and texture of these raw edges for reference. Cut a rectangular patch measuring roughly 1 in (2.5 cm) larger on all sides than the hole. If the original is a medium-weight linen canvas, for example, look for a linen canvas of a similar weight. If you\u2019re not sure about the weight and fiber content of the canvas, bring the painting into an art supply store and ask a sales agent to help you find a suitable match. For a 2 in (5.1 cm) long rip with no real width, cut a patch measuring about 4 in (10 cm) long by 2 in (5.1 cm) wide.

Use an old brush or your fingertips to smooth it out in an even layer. If you prefer, you can use an iron-on adhesive strip instead of glue.

        "You can purchase a canvas repair kit for your project, or order a sufficient length of outdoor canvas online from a specialty manufacturer.",
        "Cut out a patch that measures 2 in (5.1 cm) wider than the tear on all sides.",
        "Use straight pins to hold the patch in place on the underside of the tear.",
        "Choose a canvas in a similar color to the item you\u2019re repairing.",
        "If you can\u2019t get the exact color, choose a darker shade.",
        "Lighter patches will be more noticeable.",
        "For a tear measuring 5 in (13 cm) long by 2 in (5.1 cm) wide, cut a 9 in (23 cm) by 6 in (15 cm) patch.",
        "Sew the patch in place using a machine straight stitch.",
        "Set your sewing machine up with a heavy-duty needle and durable, UV-resistant thread.",
        "Stitch around the perimeter of the patch with a straight stitch, adding backstitches at the beginning, end, and corners for extra durability.",
        "Don\u2019t hand-sew the patch.",
        "It may look untidy and won\u2019t be as durable as a machine-sewn hem.",
        "Stitch down or darn the ripped edges on the machine.",
        "To darn the hole, run a straight stitch in a wide zig-zag all the way down the tear on your machine.",
        "Alternatively, run a straight stitch around the outside edge of the hole to secure the loose fabric down.",
        "This is especially useful if the damaged area features a wide gash or a long cut and you\u2019re left with loose flaps of canvas on top of the patch.",
        "When darning synthetic canvas that you\u2019ve melted the edges of, be very careful as you work over the stiff melted areas.",
        "Go slowly or use the handwheel when you reach these spots to avoid breaking your needle.",
        "Fixing Other Outdoor Canvas Issues Place an adhesive canvas patch behind a small hole.",
        "Purchase a canvas repair kit or a specialty adhesive canvas patch.",
        "Clean off the damaged area with an alcohol wipe to remove any dirt and debris.",
        "Then cut the patch down to size, leaving it roughly 1 in (2.5 cm) larger than the hole on all sides.",
        "Peel off the backing and press the patch onto the canvas, smoothing it out to remove any air bubbles.",
        "Any minor puncture or tear measuring less than 1 in (2.5 cm) can be repaired with an adhesive patch.",
        "For a round 1 in (2.5 cm) hole, cut a circular or square patch measuring 3 in (7.6 cm) across.",
        "The patch should have some stretch so it can move with the canvas.",
        "Opt for a clear patch if you can\u2019t find one in a matching color.",
        "Create a flat felled seam on a sewing machine when repairing a split seam.",
        "Set up your machine with a heavy-duty needle and durable, UV-resistant thread.",
        "Line up and pin the torn edges with the right sides of the canvas together.",
        "Sew a straight stitch, leaving a \u20448 in (1.6 cm) seam allowance.",
        "Press the seam open, with both parts of the seam allowance to one side.",
        "Pinch the seam allowance edges and fold them underneath themselves, so that the raw edges touch the stitches you just made.",
        "Pin or press these in place, then run 1 or 2 straight stitches over the seam allowance.",
        "A flat felled type of seam is effective because the raw edges and the first seam lines  are protected from exposure to the elements.",
        "It\u2019s very important to use a durable needle and slow sewing speed since you\u2019ll be going over 5 layers of fabric for the finishing stitches.",
        "Hire a professional to replace cloudy or discovered vinyl windows in the canvas.",
        "If the vinyl panels in your boat cover or camping tent have deteriorated, know that you don\u2019t need to replace the entire canvas.",
        "Sewing on a new piece of vinyl requires an industrial sewing machine and heavy-duty supplies, so for the best results, contact your local boating repair shop and ask if they can make this repair for you.",
        "Getting vinyl windows replaced could save you about 70% over purchasing new canvas covers.",
        "Even if you notice a split in the seam between the vinyl window and the canvas, take it to a professional since the material will be too tough for a home sewing machine to handle."
