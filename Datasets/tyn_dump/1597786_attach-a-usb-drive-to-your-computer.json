A driver is a piece of software that allows your computer to communicate with the drive. All operating systems are designed to automatically download the required drivers, but if you have no Internet connection, or if the instructions specify to install the driver manually, you should do so. The driver will generally be included on a CD if manual installation is necessary. Insert the CD and follow the prompts that appear to install the driver."

If you plan on using the device on a permanent basis, use a USB port located on the back of your computer. Front ports are a better option for quickly attaching devices and removing them shortly after."
