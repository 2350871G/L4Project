Since formaldehyde gas is toxic, do not breath it in. If you cannot use a chemical fumigant, place the eggs in single layers and lay them out in direct sunlight for the morning and afternoon.

        "The humidity should be between 60 and 65 percent, for a wet bulb reading of 80 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32.2 degrees Celsius) during incubation.",
        "Space the eggs apart evenly.",
        "Lay the eggs in your incubator, spacing them apart evenly and in single layers.",
        "For best results, lay the eggs horizontally.",
        "Doing so can increase hatchability.",
        "Try to keep the machine at least 60 percent full.",
        "If the incubator is emptier than this, adjust the temperature so that it is warmer by 0.36 degrees Fahrenheit (0.2 degrees Celsius).",
        "Turn the eggs four times each day.",
        "You should turn the egg by 180 degrees each time.",
        "Turning the eggs by 90 degrees could decrease the number of viable eggs.",
        "Sprinkle the eggs with warm water.",
        "Once a day, you should sprinkle the eggs with a little warm water.",
        "Goose eggs require a high humidity, and this water can help maintain that ideal humidity.",
        "After 15 days pass, you should submerge the eggs every other day for one minute.",
        "Make sure that the water is 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit (37.5 degrees Celsius).",
        "Transfer eggs to a hatcher after 27 days.",
        "You'll need to transfer the eggs from the main body of the incubator to a separate hatcher compartment when they are just about ready to hatch.",
        "Most eggs hatch between 28 and 35 days.",
        "If past experience indicates that your geese eggs hatch at less than 30 days of age, you should transfer the eggs to the hatcher earlier.",
        "Try to give the eggs at least three days to hatch.",
        "Maintain the proper temperature and humidity settings.",
        "The temperature in the hatcher should remain at 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius) with a relative humidity of 80 percent.",
        "Once the visible hatching process starts, reduce the temperature to 97.7 degrees Fahrenheit (36.5 degrees Celsius) and the humidity to 70 percent.",
        "Before placing the eggs in the hatcher, you should dip or sprinkle them with warm water.",
        "The water should be about 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit (37.5 degrees Celsius).",
        "Let the eggs hatch completely.",
        "The eggs usually take up to three days before hatching.",
        "Allow the goslings to remain in the hatcher for two to four hours before moving them to brooders."
