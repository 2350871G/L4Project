Here are some simple signs to watch for:\nChange in engine speed without noticeable acceleration. If you rev your engine and the car hesitates before accelerating, it can mean your clutch isn't delivering the boost in RPM through the transmission to the drive wheels. Change in the clutch pedal height where the driver feels the clutch begin to engage. Change in perceived engine power when pulling a load. A slipping clutch reduces the amount of power delivered to the drive wheels."
