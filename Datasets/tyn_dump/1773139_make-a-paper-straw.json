How many strips you cut is up to you. Each strip will make 1 straw. Don't use scrapbooking cardstock; it's too stiff and heavy to hold curls, which is  vital to making straws. You can also use printer paper for plain white straws. Look for standard, patterned scrapbooking paper. It's a medium-weight, 60 to 65 lb (27 to 29 kg) paper."
