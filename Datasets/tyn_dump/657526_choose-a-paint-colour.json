        "In the same example, a bedroom adjacent to the hallway can take the same color\u2014dark blue\u2014and make it a supporting color on the ceiling (different location and role) with less brightness (or intensity).",
        "In the previous example, you can paint your living room a light blue to contrast with your adjacent hallway.",
        "Now, repeat the darker blue for the living room's chairs for a nice contrast that still blends in with the design as a whole.",
        "Select colors based on their location on the color wheel.",
        "Taking a look at a color wheel is a great way to help you mix colors and create palettes with different contrasts.",
        "Learn all of the different rules of the color wheel and use them to select the best color combinations.",
        "Choose several shades (more black) and tints (more white) of the same color for a monochromatic scheme, which only utilizes one color.",
        "Select colors side-by-side on the color wheel when for minimal contrast that's still relaxing.",
        "If you like a more vivid contrast while maintaining colorful balance, choose colors that are found beside each other on the wheel.",
        "For example, red-violet, yellow-orange, and blue-green.",
        "For a dynamic yet simple complementary scheme, choose 2 hues that are opposite to each other on the color wheel, such as orange and blue.",
        "This is a surefire way to inject some energy into your room.",
        "You may also incorporate white and black as a way to create contrast for hanging pictures and artwork.",
        "Use color selection tools if you're stumped or need some ideas.",
        "Many paint manufacturers offer color selection tools on their websites.",
        "These programs let you upload photos of your room (or just use a standard image they supply) and \"paint\" onto it to see how your color ideas look.",
        "Try as many combinations as you can to see what works and what doesn't.",
        "Here's an example of a color selection tool: https://www.visualizecolor.com/voc#/.",
        "You can also get help from the sales associates at a local paint store if you cannot decide what color to choose.",
        "Select different finishes to differentiate colors.",
        "If you choose the same color for walls and trim, choosing different finishes can make them seem different.",
        "For example, select an eggshell finish on walls and satin on trim, or vice versa.",
        "Use low-luster or satin finishes on areas you want to have a bit of a shine.",
        "These types of paints are easier to clean and are better in high-traffic areas like hallways, kids' rooms, and kitchens.",
        "Stick with high-gloss paints for shelves, banisters, or anything you'd like to accent.",
        "But be aware that higher glosses tend to bring out imperfections.",
        "Determining Exterior Paint Colors Choose color palettes that mesh with the style and age of your home.",
        "Different color palettes work best with certain home types.",
        "For example, a rust-red and terracotta palette will look strange on an American Craftsman home.",
        "However, it can do wonders for an adobe-style home, which is defined by rounded edges and stucco walls.",
        "If you're unsure of your home's style, find some similar styles in local areas to get a feel for the best palette.",
        "Start with colors common with your home style's and then start tweaking them to suit your home's architecture and your taste.",
        "Try not to clash your home's color palette with your neighbors.",
        "Keep in mind that the most important thing is to choose what you like best.",
        "For example, modern colors would work well in a mid-century home, but if you don\u2019t like these colors, then go with another option that you do like!",
        "Choose 2 neutral colors for every 1 strong hue for trim-rich homes.",
        "If your home has lots of trims, such as siding materials, window shutters, and exterior corbels, you have lots of choice for introducing colors.",
        "To avoid making your home look chaotic, balance your strong hues with neutral colors or colors that act neutral, such as navy blue.",
        "If your door is painted a strong hue of orange, a yellow-orange is another example of a color that can act neutral the place of common neutral colors.",
        "Common neutral paint colors are black, gray, beige, ivory, taupe, and white.",
        "Distribute neutral colors over the trim and main body of your home.",
        "Save bold colors for the singular features such as the front door or shutters.",
        "Select colors that mesh with the hue and tone of the finish you don't plan to paint.",
        "When it comes to siding materials, such as stone, shingles, steel, and roofing, you probably won't paint them all.",
        "Note the ones you don't plan to paint and take them into account when choosing colors.",
        "Consider a home where you plan to paint the siding on the second level but not on the main level.",
        "If the main level is covered in ivory and gray stone, make sure the paint colors on the second level mesh well with them.",
        "Contrast colors with the natural light in your area.",
        "The topography, climate, and latitude of your environment can affect colors.",
        "For example, areas in the Pacific Northwest that are more overcast can give a muted appearance to strong colors like evergreen, while the unfiltered light experienced in the Southwest can give a lively look to the duller, earthy tones.",
        "In general, you should tone down your colors in areas that have high natural light exposure and increase their strength in areas of low natural light exposure.",
        "Try noting the light exposure in your area over the course of a week to gauge the average.",
        "Don't forget to take different seasons into account\u2014if it's overcast during the summer, you can bet that light exposure will be even less during the winter.",
        "Always account for these variations when choosing colors!",
        "You can opt for a darker paint color in a room that gets a lot of natural light, however, painting a room that gets little natural light a dark color will make it seem even darker.",
        "Highlight the surrounding landscaping.",
        "When choosing exterior colors, consider all of the characteristics of the surrounding landscape.",
        "It's up to you whether you want to contrast, match, or compliment your yard.",
        "For example, a wheat-colored home looks great against ornamental foliage and grasses and creates a matching look.",
        "Conversely, a deep charcoal home contrasts the same greens.",
        "To compliment your yard, start by choosing an exterior paint that matches the colors of your landscape.",
        "Now, increase the intensity of the color or select another hue (bold is best) to highlight the surroundings.",
        "If you want to compliment your home's landscape, consider hiring a color consultant\u2014this is the most difficult effect to achieve.",
        "Coming to a Decision Attach test swatches of the top 3 colors to your walls.",
        "Apply 2 coats each of your top 3 paint samples to letter-size white foam board (for walls that will be primed) or clear laminate sheets (for an unprimed wall).",
        "Afterward, attach the swatches to your walls with painter's tape.",
        "Let each board dry completely before painting the second coat.",
        "Take 2 photos each of the swatches every 3 to 4 hours throughout the day.",
        "To get a feel for how the paint looks throughout the day in different lighting, take photos of the swatches.",
        "For indoor paint, be sure to turn lights on and off before each photo during both the day and at night.",
        "Be sure to turn the flash off when taking your photos.",
        "Decide on the color that looks best on average.",
        "Compare all of the photos from your top 3 paint choices and decide on the one that looks best.",
        "For indoor paints, consider the ones that look best during the times that you're going to be home more often.",
        "Conversely, don't put as much emphasis on paints that look great during times of day you won't be around.",
        "If you don't like how any of them look or want some more, try some more swatches.",
        "Adjust any new swatches based on your findings.",
        "For example, paints that look took dark most of the time can be lightened and vice versa."
