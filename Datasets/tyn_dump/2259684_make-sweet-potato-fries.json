Wedges between 3 and 4 inches (7 1/2 to 10 centimeters) in length are usually a pretty good size. Regardless of what you choose, however, try to keep the majority of your wedges uniform in size. Note that you can also use a crinkle cut knife to produce crinkle cut sweet potato fries. Similarly, you can use a knife or mandolin to cut the sweet potatoes into disks."
