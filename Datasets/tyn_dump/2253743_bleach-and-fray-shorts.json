        "How much bleach and water you use depends on how white you want your shorts to get.",
        "If you want to bleach your shorts white, use equal parts of bleach and water.",
        "For a more subtle effect, use 1 part bleach and 2 parts water.",
        "Make sure that the container is made from plastic, as a metal one could react with the bleach.",
        "The container needs to be big enough to submerge the shorts.",
        "Dip the shorts into the bleach.",
        "How far you dip the shorts into the bleach depends on how far you want the bleach effect to go.",
        "You can dip them all the way into the bleach for an all-over effect, or you can dip them partway for an ombre effect.",
        "If you want a tie dye effect, crumple the shorts up first, then wrap rubber bands around them.",
        "If you are dipping the shorts all the way into the bleach water, they may not stay submerged.",
        "In this case, weigh them down with a glass jar or vase.",
        "Leave the shorts in the bleach water for 15 to 60 minutes.",
        "The longer you leave the shorts in the bleach water, the greater the effect will be.",
        "Be aware that the water and shorts may turn orange as you soak them.",
        "Do not be alarmed; this is normal.",
        "The orange tint should go away when you rinse the shorts.",
        "Alternatively, you can dip the shorts into the water, then pull them out and leave them on a plastic bag to dry for 60 minutes.",
        "Use a bristle brush to blend gradients and ombres, if desired.",
        "Place the shorts onto a plastic bag.",
        "Dip an old toothbrush or a coarse bristled brush into the bleach.",
        "Scrub the brush against the bleached areas into the unbleached areas.",
        "Let the bleach sit on the shorts for about 30 to 60 minutes, then rinse and dry the shorts again.",
        "Rinse the shorts with water once they reached the desired effect.",
        "Check on the shorts every 15 minutes.",
        "As soon as they reach the desired level of lightness you want, pull them out of the bleach, and rinse them in cool water.",
        "Keep rinsing the shorts until the water runs clear.",
        "If you tie dyed the shorts, remove the rubber bands first.",
        "Remember to wear your rubber gloves for this step.",
        "You must rinse the bleach out completely, or it will ruin your other clothes the next time you do laundry.",
        "Let the shorts dry to see the final effect.",
        "The shorts will lighten as they dry, allowing you to see the results of the bleaching process.",
        "If the shorts still aren't light enough for you, you can bleach them a second time.",
        "Adding Holes Decide where you want to put the hole.",
        "You don't have to add holes to your shorts, but they are a great way to add a vintage-y touch.",
        "The best place to add holes is somewhere in the front.",
        "Avoid placing holes in pockets or in the seat of your shorts.",
        "Skip this entire section if you don't want to add holes.",
        "Sketch out 2 horizontal, parallel lines where you want the hole to go.",
        "The length of the lines does not matter, but something between 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) would be ideal.",
        "Make sure that both lines are the same length.",
        "You'll have something that looks like an = sign.",
        "The space between the lines will create the height of your hole.",
        "Something between \u20442 and 1 inch (1.3 and 2.5 cm) would be ideal.",
        "A pen should work for most shorts, but if the fabric is too dark, use a piece of chalk instead.",
        "Cut along the lines with scissors.",
        "Pinch the fabric between your fingers and make a cut along 1 of the lines.",
        "Slide the scissors into the slit, and finish cutting along the line.",
        "Do this for both lines.",
        "You can cut the slits with a craft blade, but slide a piece of cardboard into the shorts first so that you don't cut through the back.",
        "Pull apart the white threads between the 2 slits, but don't pull them out.",
        "Find the white threads along all 4 cut edges.",
        "Pull them across the grain, just like you did with the cuffs.",
        "Be careful not to pull the threads out.",
        "Pull the blue threads out from between the 2 slits.",
        "Ignore the cut edges above and below the parallel slits.",
        "Instead, focus on the scrap of fabric between them.",
        "Find the blue threads, and pull them out.",
        "As you pull the threads out, the remaining white threads will form a hole.",
        "You may find this step easiest to do with tweezers.",
        "Don't worry if some of them rip; this will give your shorts a more vintage-y look.",
        "Don't try to rip or break the remaining white threads just yet.",
        "Wait until you wash and dry your shorts for the first time.",
        "They might break on their own."
