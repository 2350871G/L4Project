For example, if the stone you want to wire wrap is 2 in (5.1 cm) wide, then you will need at least 24 in (61 cm) of wire. You may also use 20 or 21 gauge copper or colored wire if you prefer. 20 or 21 gauge is ideal for wrapping a pendant since it is easy to work with, but strong enough to secure the stone.

        "Go through the same process to secure the other side of the stone.",
        "Twist the wires 2 times against the side of the stone across from where you secured it on the opposite side, and then bring the wires to the center of the stone (bottom of the pendant) and twist them twice against that edge as well.",
        "It is okay if the wires on 1 side of the stone are not in the exact same location as on the first side.",
        "This lack of symmetry may add interest to your pendant.",
        "Twist all 4 wires to secure the bottom of the pendant.",
        "After you have secured the second set of wires at the bottom of the pendant, grasp all 4 wires and twist them together 2 times.",
        "This will secure the bottom of the pendant.",
        "Do not cut the wires after you twist them.",
        "Leave the ends to create spirals and wrap the wire around the stone additional times.",
        "Adding Design Elements Create a jag in the wire to add a zigzag design and tighten the wire.",
        "Pinch the wire with the pliers so that they are perpendicular to the stone and then rotate the pliers 180 degrees.",
        "This will create a small Z shape in the wire and it will also tighten the wire against the stone.",
        "Repeat this as many times as you like in the wires lining the front of the stone.",
        "Make jags going all in the same direction or vary them if you prefer.",
        "To provide yourself with more wire to twist into jags, bring 1 or more of the ends extending from the bottom of the stone up and over the top of the pendant.",
        "Secure the end of the wire to the top of the pendant by twisting it around the base of the loop.",
        "Roll a piece of wire into a coil to form a spiral design on the pendant.",
        "Use the pliers to grasp the end of 1 of the wires extending from the bottom of the pendant.",
        "Then, rotate the pliers 180 degrees to form a loop with the end of the wire.",
        "Open the pliers to release the wire, and then grasp it again from the side to flatten out the loop.",
        "Rotate the pliers in a counterclockwise direction to coil the wire around the loop.",
        "Then, release the wire, return the pliers to the starting position, and rotate the pliers again to continue coiling the wire.",
        "Keep coiling the wire in this way until the spiral is the desired size.",
        "Then use the pliers to press the spiral of wire against the stone.",
        "Try making 4 coils with each of the ends of wire and grouping these along the bottom of the pendant.",
        "Wrap a piece of wire around 2 of the wires extending from the pendant.",
        "To accent the wires themselves, take 1 of the wires and use the pliers to wrap it around 2 of the other wires.",
        "Hold the 2 pieces of wire together, and start wrapping them near the base of the pendant.",
        "Wrap the wire around the other 2 pieces like a vine until you are satisfied with the look or until you run out of wire.",
        "Then, secure the 2 ends of wire to the top of the pendant.",
        "You may cut the excess from the 2 wires you wrapped, or use these ends to form spirals along the top edge of the stone.",
        "If you cut the excess, make sure to file the ends to remove any sharp or jagged points.",
        "Try a combination of wire-wrapping techniques to create a unique design!",
        "Coil the wire around a couple pieces of wire and then wrap this wire up and along the side of your pendant.",
        "Then, make 2 different sized spirals with the ends of the wire at the top of the pendant.",
        "Wrap the 4 ends of wire up and over the top of the pendant, and make 2 jags into each of the wires.",
        "Coil the ends into spirals and arrange these along the top of the pendant.",
        "Bring 2 of the wires up to the sides of the pendant and secure them with a twist.",
        "Then, make coils in each of the ends to accent the sides of the pendant.",
        "Attach the pendant to a chain or cord.",
        "When you are finished making your wire-wrapped stone pendant, insert the end of a chain or necklace cord (such as hemp or nylon) through the wire loop at the top of the pendant.",
        "Secure the ends of the chain around the wearer\u2019s neck, or tie the ends of the cord in a knot and slip the necklace over the wearer\u2019s head.",
        "Make sure that the chain or cord is the desired length for displaying your pendant.",
        "Ensure that the cord is long enough to fit over the wearer\u2019s head before you tie it in a knot."
