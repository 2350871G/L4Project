The triangles should have the following dimensions: 10 inch base, two 8 inch sides (use a ruler). It is best to use the edge of the plywood as the 10 inch base, that way one side of the triangle is already smooth and sanded. Use a table saw to cut out the two triangles. When you have them cut out, measure down 1 inch from where the two 8 inch sides meet (top point). Make a mark one inch down on both of the 8 inch sides. Connect these two points using a pencil and a ruler. Take your table saw out again and cut along the line. Make sure you do this to both triangles. Finally, take a piece of sand paper and smooth over the edges. You should now have two trapezoid shapes with 10 inch bases, and 7 inch sides (triangle with the top cut off)."

Connect these two points using a pencil and a ruler. Take your table saw out again and cut along the line. Make sure you do this to both triangles. Finally, take a piece of sand paper and smooth over the edges. You should now have two trapezoid shapes with 10 inch bases, and 7 inch sides (triangle with the top cut off). Make your legs and support beams. You will need to purchase two 48 inch 2X2 boards at your local hardware store. Take the boards back to your workspace and lay them down on a flat surface. Mark the middle point of each of the two boards (24 inches) with a ruler and pencil. Take your table saw and cut the boards along the mark you just created. You should now have four pieces of 2X2 wood, each 24 inches long. Line your four 2X2 boards flush with one another. Do this so that the four long sides, not the short ends, are next to one another. You can use a clamp to press the boards together to make the next few steps easier. Go to one end of your four boards. Make a mark 1 inch down and 5 inches down on one of the boards using a pencil and ruler. Do this again on another one of the boards. Take your ruler and line up the two 1 inch marks. Draw a line connecting them which runs across all four boards. Take your ruler and line up the two 5 inch marks. Draw a line connecting them which runs across all four boards. On two of your boards, draw an extra dash 6 inches down the board. Lay your boards on top, together. Take two boards (one with the 6 inch mark and one without) and place them separately from the other two boards. You will only work on two at a time. Lay the 6 inch marked board on the table, with the pencil lines facing up. Take the board without the 6 inch mark and turn it around 180 degrees. Lay it on top of the bottom board, also with the pencil lines facing up. The edge of the top piece should lay right on the 6 inch line of the bottom board. The 1 and 5 inch marks of both boards should run parallel with one another. Note: there is only 6 inches of total overlapping board. Clap these two boards together in between the 1 and 5 inch marks of the top board. Drill holes into your boards. On the 1 and 5 inch marks of the top board, mark the middle of those lines with a pencil and ruler. Since they are 2X2 boards, the middle of those lines should be 1 inch.

Once you have drilled the holes, lay down a washer over each hole and then slide 4 1/2 inch bolts into each of the holes. Take off the clamp once the bolts are all the way through. Creating Foot and Leg Supports Take out one trapezoid piece. This is the piece you cut earlier.

Put two washers on the ends of the bolts (side of the trapezoid) and then place a nut on each of the bolts. Use a wrench to tighten and secure the nuts all he way down to the face of the trapezoid. Make a footbed. Get out another piece of plywood. Measure out a rectangle that is 10 inches long and 4 inches wide. Cut the rectangle out with a table saw. Smooth over the edges using a piece of sandpaper. Flip your attached 2X2 boards around so that the trapezoid is facing up.

Take your 3 inch pipe piece and cut it in half along the top, not the side, with a table saw. One of these halves will go on one stilt, while the other half will go on the other stilt. Take one of the halves and place it above the footing, about 1 inch from the top of the stilt. The pip should curl inward. Pre-two holes into the pipe, halfway through the 2X2 inch board.

        "This hole should be in the middle of plastic pipe, but on the reverse side.",
        "Cut a piece of one-wrap velcro that is a little longer than the circumference of your calf.",

        "Put the stilts on your legs.",
        "It is best to sit high-up, like on a bar stool, when you put your stilts on.",
        "Also, make sure that the stool is next to a higher structure, such as the edge of your house, or a fence, so that when you stand you have something to hold onto.",
        "Sit on the stool and put on each of the stilts on one at a time.",
        "Place your foot in the appropriate stilt.",
        "Slide it into the shoe and tie the shoe.",
        "Then, wrap the velcro around your leg tightly, and attach it around (the velcro sticks to itself).",
        "You do not want to wrap too tightly, otherwise you could lose circulation.",
        "Practice walking around with your stilts.",
        "Get out of your stool and stand up on your stilts, as you lean against a taller structure (fence, house, etc.)",
        "Walk back and forth slowly, holding onto the structure, to get used to how they feel.",
        "Once you feel comfortable enough, let your hands go, but continue to walk near the tall structure in case you fall.",
        "It is best to have an extra person nearby to catch you if you fall in the opposite direction.",

        "Undo the velcro strips, and step out of the shoes.",
        "Place the stilts some place you won't forget them and they won't get damaged.",
        "You are now free to decorate your stilts if you would like.",
        "Add a coat of paint to them.",
        "You can stain the wood to protect it from moisture.",
        "You can even add stickers or pen designs.",
