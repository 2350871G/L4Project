Building a Water Barometer Cut the top off of a plastic bottle. Ordinary two-liter plastic bottles work great. Use one that is empty and clean. Take a pair of scissors and carefully snip the entire top off, down to the point where the sides become straight instead of curved. Set a ruler inside the bottle. It should stand up inside, flat against the side of the bottle. Put a piece of tape over the outside of the bottle and part of the ruler to hold everything in place. You should be able to see the numbers on the ruler. Insert clean tubing. The tubing should stop just above the bottom of the bottle. Tape it in place straight against the ruler. It's best to tape the tubing above the water, since tape covered by water may loosen and fall off. You will probably need about 40 centimetres (16 in) of tubing to be able to stick up out of the top of the bottle. If your tubing isn't long enough, cut the sides of the bottle so they are lower.
