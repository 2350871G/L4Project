Use four simple wooden boards pushed against the walls of the garage and secured either by weights or nailed together. Even out the garage floor by removing any debris and evening out any irregularities in the surface using a trowel or other tools.  Place the frame on the floor.  Mix the concrete in your wheelbarrow.  Pour the concrete mix slowly and evenly over the floor. This is best done from the end of the wheelbarrow, evening with the trowel as you move along. Pour 3 inches (or 5 cm). Place the steel rods or rebar around the edges of the freshly poured concrete mix and through the middle of your floor if working with a large area. These bars will provide strength to the concrete. Have the bars prepared before pouring. Allowing the concrete to dry too much between pours will create layers and make the concrete weaker. To attain an even floor, pouring slowly and evenly. Continually even the cement with a trowel. Go as high as you wish your floor to be. Smooth over the surface of the cement with your trowel after pouring. Ensure an even floor by checking that there are no air pockets or pools of cement in the corners. Let the floor dry for at least a day. Check that no air bubbles or other irregularities form. Remove the frame once the floor is dry and you can easily lift the boards. If the boards are hard to lift, let the floor sit for another day. Step on and use the floor only once it is completely dry. Tap the surface with a boot or a hammer to make sure it is solid and free of cracks.",
