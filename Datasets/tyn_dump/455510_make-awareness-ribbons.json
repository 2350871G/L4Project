Ribbons are also worn to demonstrate solidarity with a particular group, for instance Black Lives Matter or the LGBT community. Check your sources carefully. Some organizations, such as Susan G. Komen for the Cure and Autism Speaks, are strongly disliked by the people they claim to be helping. Be careful about what type of group you are supporting."
