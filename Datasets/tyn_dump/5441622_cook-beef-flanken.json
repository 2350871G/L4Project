You don't want to defrost tougher pieces of meat, like this, in the microwave. Mix a marinade. There are several marinades that work well with short ribs, including red wine, dark beer and Asian-style ribs.

Place your defrosted beef flanken ribs in the bag. Seal it and flip the bag several times to coat the meat. Place the bag in the refrigerator for four hours.
