Simple carbs can be the worst culprit, as they break down easily in your body. Not only does this spike your blood sugar, it also feeds your gut bacteria, which results in more gas. Simple carbs are usually more processed, such as baked goods, sugary snacks, and items made with white flour. Instead, choose complex carbs like carrots and potatoes, which are healthier. You can recognize complex carbs because they're whole foods, such as carrots, potatoes, beans, and corn. Since many of these foods are high in fiber, they'll still produce gas, but less than with simple carbs. Fewer carbohydrates often means fewer breads and sweets, which is a healthy part of any diet plan."

When bacteria in your colon breaks down hydrogen sulfides as your food is digested, your body produces gas that smells like sulfur. This means stinky farts!
