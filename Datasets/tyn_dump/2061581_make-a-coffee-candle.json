        "Let the wax cool completely at room-temperature.",
        "This can take anywhere from a couple of hours to a full day.",
        "It all depends on the type of wax you used to make your candle, how big your candle is, and how warm or cool it is in your kitchen.",
        "The remaining quarter of wax will also cool, which is fine.",
        "You will re-melt later.",
        "Finishing the Candle Reheat the remaining wax.",
        "Most candles develop a small well in the center as they cool.",
        "Reheat the remaining quarter of wax using a double-boiler, just as before.",
        "You do not need to add more coffee or essential oil to it.",
        "If you did not get a well in the middle of your candle, you can use this wax to fill your candle holder the rest of the way.",
        "Pour the wax into the well that formed in the middle of your candle.",
        "If you used a strainer for the first batch of wax, you should use a strainer for this batch as well.",
        "Don't worry if this wax overfills the well; as long as it is contained inside the candle holder you should be fine.",
        "Allow the wax to harden again.",
        "This should not take as long as the first time because you are using a smaller amount of wax.",
        "Use your fingernail to scrape off any wax that got on the outside of your candle holder at this time.",
        "Trim the wick to \u20448 inch (0.32 cm).",
        "This will prevent the flame from climbing too high.",
        "It will also reduce the amount of smoke.",
        "Once you trim the candle, you can light it.",
        "Keep the candle on a heat-safe surface while it burns, and never leave it unattended.",
        "Trim the wick to \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) each time that you use the candle."
