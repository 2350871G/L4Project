Options when you are travelling include leak-proof plastic containers or leak-proof Ziploc style bags. Alternatively, if you are just out for the day or at work, most pads can be folded so the soiled part is in the middle. You may wish to rinse the pad in the sink, or simply place the pad in dry in a protective bag such as a Ziploc bag. You can also purchase reusable cloth \"wet bags\" similar to diaper bags from many cloth pad sellers. Ensure you soak the pad when you get home so as to prevent stains setting in. Soaking or rinsing soon after use is essential to prevent stains from blood, urine or discharge setting in."

These all prevent musty bad smells, and are gentle but effective antibacterials/ antimicrobials. This is particularly important if you have a thrush (candida) infection. once you cure the infection, you must disinfect the pads by soaking as mentioned above. The sun is also very effective at killing germs- hang your pads out in the sunlight for the day if you're worried about germs.
