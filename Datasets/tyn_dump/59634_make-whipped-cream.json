Some people prefer soft whipped cream, which slumps deliciously down the side of cakes and pies. Others prefer stiffer whipped cream that retains a certain shape when it's used to top a dessert. Keep whipping until the cream reaches the texture you desire. Stop whipping before it turns to butter. If you keep whipping for too long (which is easier to do with an electric mixer than by hand) the cream will turn to solid butter. If this happens to you, save the butter to make cinnamon sugar toast or another delicious treat and start over with a new batch of cream."
