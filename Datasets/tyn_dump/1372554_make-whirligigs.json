    "text": " Creating a Whirligig Toy Draw 2 circles on a piece of paper and color them. Draw your own circles or trace around a tin can. Make sure that both circles are exactly the same size. An ideal size is about 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter. Colour the circles in with your favourite colours. When you spin the whirligig, the colours on the toy will merge together. For example, blue and red will make purple. If you would rather use an existing template, search online for a free whirligig toy template and print it out. 1 circle will be used for the front of the whirligig and 1 for the back. Cut around the outside of the circle templates. Try to cut as close to the lines as possible. If necessary, ask an adult to help you use the scissors. Glue 1 of the templates onto heavy cardboard. Place 1 of the templates on a piece of scrap paper and use a glue stick to cover the blank side with glue. Stick the template onto the thick cardboard. Recycle an old cardboard box or purchase thick cardboard from a craft store. Cut around the outside of the template to create the whirligig circle. Use scissors to cut out the circle whirligig. Try not to cut the template, instead cut just outside the template line. If you have trouble cutting the thick card, use a sharper pair of scissors. Stick the other template onto the blank side of the whirligig circle. Place the remaining template onto a piece of scrap paper and cover the back side with glue. Stick the template onto the blank side of the whirligig circle and move it around until it is positioned in the centre of the cardboard. Poke 2 holes in the middle of the whirligig about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) apart. Most templates will have 2 dots in the middle of the whirligig that indicate where to make the holes. If your template doesn\u2019t have dots, simply estimate where the middle of the whirligig is and draw the 2 dots yourself. Carefully push the skewer through each dot until it reaches the other side of the cardboard. Don\u2019t worry about marking the whirligig with the dots, as the dots will disappear when you poke a hole through them. Purchase skewers from a supermarket or a kitchen store. Cut a piece of string that is 36 inches (91 cm) long. Use a tape measure to measure the string and then cut it with a pair of scissors. Thin string works best for this activity, as it is easier to thread through the holes. Purchase string from a craft store. Thread the string through the holes to create a loop and knot the ends. Push the string through 1 hole and then back toward yourself through the other hole. If you are having trouble poking the string through the holes, lick the end of the thread and then squeeze it between your fingers. This makes the end narrower and easier to thread. If your string won\u2019t fit through the hole, use thinner string or use a skewer to make the hole bigger. Tug on the string to make sure that your knot is secure. Making a Whirligig Swirl Draw a spiral on a circular piece of cardstock. Cut the cardstock into a large circle if necessary. Make the spiral large enough to cover the entire page. Start at the edge of the cardstock and continue the spiral to the middle point of the circle. Keep your pen on the paper for the entire swirl to ensure that the line is continuous. If you want to use a template, search online for a free whirligig spiral template and then press print. If you want a colourful whirligig, use coloured cardstock or draw patterns on the paper. Purchase circle paper from a craft store, or trace a tin and make your own. Cut along the spiral line to create a snake effect. This creates 1 long paper snake. If you\u2019re having trouble cutting along the tight circles with your scissors, try using a smaller pair of scissors. Punch a hole at the tip of the whirligig. Locate the middle of the spiral and then use a hole punch to make a hole in the middle of the card. Choose a hole punch size that is wider than your string. If you don\u2019t have a hole punch, use a skewer to poke a hole through the paper instead. Tie a 8 in (20 cm) piece of string through the hole.
