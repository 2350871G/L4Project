Covering nearby items will keep them clean. If your items are easily movable, just scoot them out of the way! Also keep your window open, to prevent dust from lingering in the air. Chalk the spot on the mortar where you want to install the hook. Mark the mortar, and not the brick, because the brick is too hard to drill into. Don\u2019t worry about leaving a mark. You can rub away the extra chalk when you\u2019re done. Position the frame over your mark and have a friend look from across the room. From a distance, your friend can tell you if it looks like a good spot to hang the picture. If it doesn\u2019t look good, readjust. It\u2019s much easier to readjust at this stage than when you\u2019ve already drilled a hole!

Drill a hole into the spot on the mortar you\u2019ve marked with your chalk. To drill, place the tip of the bit against the spot you want to drill, making sure the drill is perpendicular to the wall.

It may help to mark the length of your wall anchor on your drill bit with some masking tape, so that you know how deep to drill. Installing Anchors and Hanging the Pictures Tap a wall anchor into the hole with a rubber mallet. Tapping it with a mallet will make sure it goes in much better than if you tried to just stick it in with your fingers. If your picture is under 10 pounds (4.5kg), then a plastic wall anchor will be strong enough to hold it up. If your picture is somehow over 10 pounds (maybe you have an incredibly ornate frame), then opt for a self-drilling anchor. Screw a picture hook onto the wall anchor. Just place the screw into the hole in the picture hook and match it up with the hole in the wall anchor. Use a screwdriver and twist clockwise until the hook is in place. Some wall anchors already have a stud in them for hanging pictures, in which case you can skip this step! Hang your picture frame over the hook. Have a friend stand across the room and tell you if it looks right. Move the picture side to side until it is hanging evenly. To make extra sure your picture is hanging evenly, you can place a level on top of the frame, and adjust the position of the picture until it is even. Hanging Lightweight Pictures without Drilling Mount brick clamps if the bricks are not flush. If the bricks poke out over the grout, and are not all flush with each other, then you can attach a brick clamp. Simply snap the clip onto the protruding brick face, and you\u2019re ready to hang the picture. When buying the brick clamp, check how much weight it can bear. Attach adhesive hooks if your bricks are flush. If your bricks are all flush with each other, then you won\u2019t be able to put on a brick clamp. Instead, use adhesive picture hanging hooks. These have the advantage of coming off without leaving a mark, which is especially desirable in a dorm room or if you have a picky landlord. But adhesive hooks can\u2019t bear as much weight as an anchored hook drilled into the mortar, so make sure your picture is light enough. Use double-sided tape if your picture is extremely lightweight. If you are trying to hang a piece of light paper on the wall, such as a child\u2019s drawing, then double-sided tape will be strong enough to hold it onto the brick. Simply place pieces of double-sided tape on all four corners of the back of the child\u2019s drawing and then stick it onto the brick.",
