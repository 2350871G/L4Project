Keeping the nails moisturized helps improve their overall appearance, as the damaged cells stick together. Avoid cutting your cuticles to prevent further damage. Your cuticles protect new nail growth underneath the surface, and removing the cuticle can cause more damage to your nails. Push back on your cuticles with a cuticle pusher, rather than snipping them off with a cuticle cutter. Do this about once a week for best results. Apply a nail strengthener to support your fingernails as they heal. Nail strengtheners are polishes specially designed to improve the overall health and hardness of your nails. These work great after removing a manicure, as they replenish the nail bed and nail plate with nutrients. Apply 1-2 coats about 1-3 times a week, or whenever you notice the first layer start to disappear. This is a good idea if you want to apply polish but don\u2019t want to damage your nails anymore. Go to the salon if your nails are in really rough shape. If your nails are severely uneven or cracked even after doing a nail treatment, your best bet is to go to a salon for help. The trained professionals can use a sander to smoothen your nails. You can also get a deep conditioning treatment to revitalize your nails. If your nail length is damaged but still intact, your nail technician may use silk wraps to help reinforce your nail. These wraps use thin silk fabric wrapped and glued around your nail to provide additional strength. Silk wraps are usually painted over after application. You may not want to go to the salon, as that\u2019s why you removed the manicure set yourself. However, it may be best for the overall health of your nails.",
