Alternately, you can wear a floor-length off-white skirt and a camisole. The camisole should have a neckline that reaches about up to your collarbone. Look for a dress or skirt in your closet, online or at a second-hand store. If you like to sew, you can make the skirt."

Once that dries, you can paint it with acrylic paints. Optionally, you can wrap the middle of the sword with brown paper or beige fabric and tie it with a burgundy string, the way Mulan presented it to the Emperor.

Keep wrapping it around your waist until there\u2019s a bit of fabric left hanging in the back. Tuck that fabric underneath and secure it with a concealed safety pin. Carry a stuffed toy dog. Little Brother is Mulan\u2019s small beige dog with dark brown spots, long ears, and a black nose. He wears a blue collar. If the toy dog you\u2019re using doesn\u2019t come with a blue collar, use a blue ribbon around its neck. There are a few ways you can incorporate Little Brother into your costume. Simply carry the stuffed toy around with you. Have the toy dog peeking out of your purse or tote bag, if you\u2019re bringing one. Attach it to your costume. You can sew it to the front of your dress with a simple stitch. Wear simple, flat shoes. Mulan\u2019s skirt is floor-length in this look and covers her feet. Opt for whatever comfortable, neutral flats you like. Avoid wearing heels as they might show underneath your bottom hem. Get a long, black wig in a low, knotted ponytail. Look for a wig with a center part and without bangs. Put the wig on. Arrange the hair in a low ponytail with a hair elastic. Then take a small piece of hair and wrap it around the ponytail at the base. Pull at the elastic underneath the ponytail and slide the section of hair through the gap. Secure it with a bobby pin. You may want to wear a wig cap and secure the wig with bobby pins and/or wig adhesive tape. Wearing Mulan\u2019s Hanfu Outfit Get a pink robe. This will be the main part of the costume that you will layer the other pieces over. It\u2019s okay if the robe has pockets, because you can cover the pockets up later with another fabric.

If you\u2019re buying fabric, make sure you have enough to wrap around your waist at least once. This should go around the smallest part of your waist. You should also ensure that you have a little bit left over so that you can use it for your hairstyle. Get a soft purple scarf and a green necklace. Ideally, the purple scarf will be a light, sheer lavender fabric. It should be long enough to hold in the crooks of your arms like a shawl. You can buy a simple green beaded necklace or make your own. You can make your own necklace using craft supplies and the following tutorial: https://family.disney.com/craft/mulans-jade-necklace/ Style your hair in a topknot with a flower. You can use a fake magnolia blossom, cherry blossom, or similar artificial flower from a craft store. Cut the stem down with wire cutters so that there is a just a few inches of stem.

If you\u2019ve cut the stem with wire cutters, you may want to bend the cut tip or file it a bit so it doesn\u2019t poke into your head. Secure it all in place with clips or bobby pins. Wear gold drop earrings. Mulan wears round gold earrings with dangling teardrop beads. You can look for similar earrings online or at a local store that carries costume jewelry. eBay is a great place to find unique, vintage, and even clip-on earring styles. Wear strong makeup. When Mulan wears her hanfu look to visit the Matchmaker, she has dark purple eyeshadow. Her cheeks have pink blush. She also wears a dark berry-colored lipstick.

Also, you want it to stand out against the darker blue piece you\u2019ll be layering over it. Use a long-sleeved blouse with peasant sleeves if you can find one.

The color should be somewhere between white and powder blue, at least a shade lighter than your shirt. Look for an A-line or mermaid skirt so that it has some flare to the bottom. Layer on the outer dress. Look for a dark blue dress that is about knee-length, with short, angled sleeves, such as exaggerated cap sleeves or short kimono sleeves. Alternately, you can get a sleeveless dark blue robe (preferably without pockets), or cut the sleeves off a robe yourself. Add a mauve sash.

Wear a long necklace with a large gold medallion. How elaborate you want to get with this detail is up to you. You have multiple options. You can wear any type of large gold medallion on a chain necklace or a long gold ribbon. Or you can recreate Mulan\u2019s Crest of the Emperor medallion in a simple or a complex way.

You can look for a prop sword to buy online or at costume shops. To make your own prop sword, make a template out of foam board.

Mulan has a fan that saves her from a wielded sword! It\u2019s a gold-colored fan with black trim. You can buy a fan and spray paint it gold, or make your own fan from scratch. Wear a short black wig. If you can\u2019t go to a wig store in person, you\u2019ll probably need to measure your head in order to buy one online.
