    "text": " Folding Your Bacon in Wax Paper Cut a long strip of wax paper. You want to have enough wax paper to spread out your entire package of bacon with a couple inches between each piece. You can also use parchment paper. Lay your wax paper on your counter. Be sure your counter is clean and free of crumbs. Place your bacon on the wax paper. With your fingers or tongs, place one piece of bacon on one end of the wax paper. Smooth the bacon flat. Wrap your bacon. Grab the other end of the wax paper and pull it toward your bacon until it touches the edge of the slice you just laid down. Create a crease so that your bacon stays put. Your first slice of bacon is now covered with wax paper on both sides. Add another slice of bacon. Place it directly on top of the wax paper covering the top of your first slice. Repeat your fold. Pull the end of your wax paper that is free of bacon back over the top of your second slice of bacon. You are essentially creating an accordion fold around each slice of bacon so that they are individually wrapped. Continue this process until all your bacon is folded into the wax paper. Place your bacon in a freezer bag. Place your wax paper-wrapped bacon stack in the bottom of the bag and use your arm to flatten the rest of the bag against the counter. Be sure to squeeze all the air out of the bag. Write the date on your freezer bag so that you remember how long you have stored it. Freeze. There\u2019s no need to deep freeze your bacon, just be sure that your freezer is set at zero degrees. Rolling Your Bacon Individually Prepare a baking sheet. Line your baking sheet with a piece of wax paper or parchment paper. The lined baking sheet will serve as your surface for creating and freezing your bacon rolls. Create your rolls. You can lay your bacon onto your prepared baking sheet or roll your bacon as you pull it out of the package. Begin on one end of the bacon strip and roll it until the entire piece is wrapped around itself. Place your rolls on your baking sheet. Be sure that the end of your bacon roll is on the bottom so that the bacon doesn\u2019t uncoil. Your bacon will resemble the shape of a snail. Be sure that the bacon rolls aren\u2019t touching each other. Freeze your bacon. Once you have completed all of your bacon rolls, place the baking sheet into your freezer.

If have more bacon than fits on your baking sheet, you can add another sheet of wax paper on top of your first layer of bacon.

Separate your bacon. Once your bacon is frozen on your baking sheet, pull off the slices of bacon from your wax paper, place them in an airtight container or freezer bag, and put them back in the freezer immediately.
