Matcha powder typically clumps up during storage, but sifting the powder into your cup should break up these clumps and make the green tea easier to dissolve. Short, wide cups work better than tall, skinny cups. You'll need to manipulate the ingredients inside the cup using whisks and other tools, and fitting these tools into the cup will be easier when the cup has a wide mouth."

The water should be ready immediately before the kettle whistles. If the tea kettle reaches a whistle, pour out the necessary 1/4 cup (60 ml) and let it rest for at least 60 seconds before continuing to the next step. Simmer the water in a saucepan if you do not have a tea kettle. Do not use boiling water for the next step. Matcha is somewhat delicate, and boiling water can actually have a negative effect on the taste and nutritional quality of the tea."

There should be no lumps remaining when you finish whisking these two ingredients together. While bamboo whisks are the most conventional tool to use when preparing matcha drinks, you could also use a standard metal whisk if necessary. Similarly, a handheld frother would also combine the water and green tea powder effectively."

Place the saucepan on the stove over medium heat and warm it until bubbles start to form around the edges. Like the water, you should not allow the milk to reach a full boil. The milk should only reach a mild simmer. If you're checking with a thermometer, the ideal temperature is about 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65 degrees Celsius). You can use nearly any type of milk for this recipe, including whole milk, low-fat milk, non-fat milk, and non-dairy alternatives (almond milk, soy milk, coconut milk, etc.). You can also use half-and-half. Note, however, that milks lower in fat may not produce as much foam."

Run the frother for about 30 seconds, or as needed to create your desired level of foam. Dip the frother just beneath the surface of the milk to concentrate the process at the surface and produce more foam. If you do not have a frother, vigorously whisking the milk using a standard metal whisk will also produce foam. Using a whisk will take longer than using a frother, though. You can technically skip this step altogether, but doing so will result in a latte that lacks an initial layer of froth."

Stir gently to avoid destroying the upper layer of foam. If you did not froth the milk prior to adding it, you can whisk the green tea and milk together instead of stirring them.

        "Whole dairy milk will usually create the most, while non-fat dairy and non-dairy milks may produce very little.",
        "Cocktail shakers work especially well for this process, but if you don't have one, the next best option would be a jar with a lid.",
        "If neither option is available, you can still prepare the iced latte in a wide-mouthed glass; combine all of the ingredients except the ice in a wide glass or bowl capable of holding at least 8 oz (250 ml).",
        "Shake well.",
        "Close the shaker and vigorously shake it for at least 60 seconds.",
        "Check the contents; if ready, the drink should look evenly colored and foamy.",
        "When preparing the drink in a glass instead of a cocktail shaker or sealable jar, vigorously whisk the matcha, milk, and water together using a bamboo or metal whisk.",
        "You can also combine the three ingredients using an immersion blender; process them together for approximately 10 to 20 seconds before continuing.",
        "Add the remaining ice to serving glasses.",
        "Evenly divide the remaining 1 cup (250 ml) of ice between two serving glasses.",
        "Each glass must be able to hold a minimum of 1 cup (250 ml).",
        "Alternatively, you can make one large latte instead of two smaller ones.",
        "Add all of the ice to a tall glass capable of holding at least 2 cups (500 ml).",
        "Pour the latte into the glasses.",
        "Pour the green tea latte through the shaker spout and into the prepared serving glasses, retaining the original ice rather than allowing it to enter the glasses.",
        "For lattes mixed in a glass or bowl, simply pour the prepared drink over the ice.",
        "If it isn't as cold as you would prefer it to be, try chilling it in the refrigerator for 10 minutes or in the freezer for 1 to 2 minutes.",
        "Enjoy.",
        "The green tea latte should be finished and ready to drink.",
        "If you were unable to produce a satisfactory amount of foam while mixing the drink, consider garnishing your iced latte with a small amount of whipped cream.",
        "Sprinkle the whipped cream or froth with additional matcha, if desired, to improve the overall presentation."
