Keep your eyes peeled for their brown, gray, or green bodies that may blend into the surrounding area. If you have an outdoor infestation, look on the underside of leaves for eggs and keep an eye out for discolored leaves. Tip: Stink bugs prefer tomatoes, peaches, apples, grapes, berries, corn, soybeans, peppers, alfalfa, and wheat, so check these plants first. If you haven\u2019t crushed any stink bugs but start to notice a cilantro-like odor in your home, chances are you have an infestation."

        "Saturate a towel with water and wring it out so that it\u2019s damp, rather than dripping.",
        "Bring it outdoors and drape the towel over a deck railing, an empty planter, a tree branch, or any other surface in your yard.",

        "Flick a bug into the container while it\u2019s face-up, or pop an empty, unlidded container face-down over a bug to trap it.",
        "Then slip a piece of paper underneath the opening to create a temporary lid so you can flip the container over and keep the bug inside.",
        "Then screw on the lid tightly.",
        "Once you\u2019ve caught it, either bag it up and dispose of it in an outdoor garbage can or flush it down the toilet.",
        "Add some soapy water to the container to more quickly kill the bugs.",

        "Use an electric insect trap to zap stink bugs.",
        "Purchase an electric insect trap from a hardware store and install it near where the stink bugs gather, according to the manufacturer's instructions.",
        "Turn it on at night to attract the bugs.",
        "As they approach the trap\u2019s bright light, they\u2019ll get a sudden shock of electricity.",
        "The next morning, turn off the trap and shake off or vacuum away any dead bugs.",
        "Spread fly tape along stink bug entryways to capture them.",
        "Apply sticky fly tape along windowsills, doorways, cracks, vents, and any other notable entryways around your home.",
        "Check the tape every day for trapped bugs.",
        "To keep the odors at a minimum, bag up and discard the whole strip once you catch a single stink bug, then replace the strip.",

        "Fly tape can be purchased at a hardware store.",

        "Using Natural Pesticides Spray the stink bugs you see with a soap, water, and lavender oil solution.",
        "Mix 4 cups (950 mL) of hot water with \u20444 cup (180 mL) of mild dish soap.",
        "Use a spray bottle to spritz this solution directly onto stink bugs or on the vegetation they\u2019ve been gathering on.",
        "Or try a mixture of equal parts hot water, mild dish soap, and lavender oil to kill the bugs and keep them away.",

        "As a preventative method, repeat this every other day for about a week.",

        "As a result, adult stink bugs that are exposed to it will gradually starve themselves and will not lay any eggs.",
        "Sprinkle diatomaceous earth (DE) around your property to kill bugs when they try to enter.",
        "DE is a natural sedimentary rock containing silica, alumina, and iron oxide that is often used as a natural pesticide.",
        "Spread this chalky powder both outside and inside, focusing on entryways like windows and doors along with other areas where stink bugs seem to gather.",
        "Dust any stink bugs you see with the powder directly, in addition to spreading the powder out in areas where stink bugs gather.",
