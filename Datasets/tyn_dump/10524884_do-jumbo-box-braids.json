Normal-sized braids are approximately the width of a pencil, so if you want jumbo braids, you can go with any size larger than that. Make your choice based on the current condition of your hair and the look you\u2019re trying to create. The larger you make your jumbo braids, the heavier they will be. If your hair isn\u2019t in the best condition right now, it's best to keep your jumbo braids on the smaller side of the spectrum. Micro braids are anything thinner than the width of a pencil. Like jumbo braids, micro braids can also vary in size slightly."

If you want your braids to be longer or thicker than your natural hair, you\u2019ll need to purchase hair extensions. Human hair extensions are the best choice, but they\u2019re also the most expensive option. Make your decision based on what you can afford. For example, waist-length box braids are a popular look, but most people don\u2019t have waist-length hair naturally! You'll need extensions for this look. Bob-length box braids are a popular style choice, as well. Depending on the length of your hair, you may not need extensions for this look. Remember to factor in your hair's strength. The longer the braids are, the heavier they\u2019ll be."

If your hair is thick and coarse, or if you want a kinkier, more undone look, make sure your extensions have a similar texture. Choose weft bundles that are similar to the braid size you're going for, since you'll be using 1 weft bundle per braid. You will add the extensions during the braiding process, so if you have extensions currently installed, you'll need to take them out and start fresh with new ones. You may want to examine your hair and the extensions side by side to make sure the textures match before you buy anything. For a fun look, consider hair extensions in an eye-catching color like pink or blue. Make these decisions before you start braiding for the best results."

        "Once you get to the end of the braid, wrap an elastic around the hair to secure it.",
        "If you prefer, you can dip the ends in extremely hot water to seal them off instead of using hair elastics.",
        "If you don\u2019t have previous experience with the hot water technique, use hair elastics for the simplest solution.",
        "Some people like to seal the ends by burning them quickly with a lighter.",
        "If you\u2019ve used this technique before and feel comfortable with it, feel free to use it for this.",
        "Repeat the same process on every section of hair.",
        "Finish braiding the gridded sections you created with the loose hair first, then unclip the next quadrant of hair, create another grid, and continue the same technique.",
        "Keep going until you finish braiding your entire head of hair.",
        "The full process could take 2 to 7 hours to complete, depending on the style you\u2019re going for, so be sure to take a few breaks!",
        "Smooth the finished braids with a small amount of hair oil, if desired.",
        "You don\u2019t have to do this, but it can make your braids look smoother and glossier.",
        "You only need to put a tiny amount of oil on your fingertips and work them gently over each braid from root to tip to smooth the hair down and add a little shine."
