Extra virgin olive oil is full of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. It is great for dry, oily, and aging skin alike. It can help treat acne, eczema, and psoriasis. It can give skin a healthy glow, and make it appear more smooth and youthful. If this is for your face, consider replacing 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 milliliters) of the olive oil with rose hip oil. It has vitamin C and anti-aging properties, making it ideal for dry, aging skin."

Some types of essential oil also have additional benefit for the skin. If this is for your face, reduce the amount to 10 to 15 drops to avoid possible irritations. For acne, try tea tree, bergamot, or geranium oil. For anti-aging, try pomegranate, grapefruit, or lavender. For a brighter or glowing complexion, use moringa oil or peppermint oil.

If you have very sensitive skin, you might want to limit yourself to just once a week, or even more seldom. If you use the scrub too often, you may end up irritating the skin on your face.

        "Rinse the scrub off.",
        "If your skin feels oily afterwards, you can wash it with soap and more water.",

        "Alternatively, you can skip the soap and leave a thin film of oil on your skin.",
        "Your skin will absorb this oil, and become softer."
