Alternately, you can drop an old shirt, towel, or thin blanket over the snake, scoop it up in the fabric, and gently drop the whole bundle into a pillowcase. You can then relocate the snake to a safe outdoor area away from people. This method is more dangerous, though, since you cannot see where the snake's head is, and it may bite you through the fabric. If using a pillowcase, gently shake the pillowcase by the opening to ensure the snake is at the very bottom.
