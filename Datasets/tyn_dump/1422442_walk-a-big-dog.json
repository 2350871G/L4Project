                    "description": "Both the leash and the collar can be used to control the dog, but some brands and types work different for different kinds of dogs. Knowing the correct option can be something difficult to ascertain. Use a simple leash and collar. This option works well for balanced dogs who understand their place in the pack (i.e. subservient to the human) and do not cause issues on walks. Choose this option if your dog has a happy demeanor and no obedience issues. Try a slip collar. For more difficult dogs, those distracted by a variety of things on the walk, the slip collar can be a great option. The corrections made by slip collars pinch the brachial nerve and imitate how mature dogs nip at the necks of their puppies for social purposes. The Pack Leader Collar (PLC) is a great option for difficulties with slip collars. While slip collars may cause issues, the PLC fits around the neck towards the head. By placing focus there, the dog has less pulling power and less control. Using this collar is a great way to keep the dog\u2019s nose up and away from distractions. Use a harness. For many dog owners, a body harness or \"Halti\" head collar might be preferable, especially if your dog tends to pull. Some of these products, like the Halti, have the ability to steer and muzzle the dog, as well as stop them from pulling."

Try a few of the following suggestions:\nWell-mannered dogs can be controlled by simply placing a thumb in the handle of the leash, and then enclosing the hand around the rest of the leash. For more control, fold the handle a couple times into the palm of your hand. Ensure the handle protrudes towards the bottom of your fist so it slips out when uncontrollable force yanks the leash. This leash accordion can be let loose for more slack if the dog needs more room. Hold the leash firmly in both hands while draping it across your lap. This works well if the accordion is in a hand close to your hip, and the other is naturally on the other side. Use two hands. With one hand extended holding the leash folds, use the other hand to hold the portion of the leash closest to you. Brace that rear hand on your back hip for more support. Try selecting a shorter leash for more control. The shortened length of the leash will provide less leeway for the dog to pull and knock you off balance."
