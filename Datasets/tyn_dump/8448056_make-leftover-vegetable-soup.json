You\u2019ll need at least 1 lb (.45 kg) of veggies cut into chunks, but you can use as much as 2 lbs (.91 kg). Be sure to rinse and clean your veggies under cool water before cutting them. Feel free to mix and match veggies, too. In some cases, like with turnips or cabbage, you may need to soften the natural bitterness of the vegetable or its aroma. This can be done by adding cream, yogurt, white beans, or lemon to the soup. Some common veggies used in soups include things like sweet potatoes, zucchini, squash, turnips, tomatoes, celery, mushrooms, leeks, cabbage, and kale. Veggies that are a little firmer in consistency, like butternut squash, will take much longer to cook down than tender greens."

When saut\u00e9ing the veggies in the oil:\nAdd about 2.6 lbs (1200 g) of canned plum tomatoes (roughly 3 cans worth). Add in 2 cups (500 ml) of vegetable stock and 1 tsp (5 ml) of sugar. Simmer the ingredients for about 10 minutes or until the tomatoes begin to dissolve. Mix in \u00bd cup (118 ml) of cream, adjust the seasoning of the soup to taste, and enjoy.
