Add the lemon zest, sugar, cinnamon stick, and salt to the same saucepan, then set the pan on your stove over medium-low heat. Mix the contents of the saucepan slowly and continuously as they heat up and do not use a higher heat setting. Milk burns and sticks to pans easily, so continuous motion and low heat are both necessities. Continue heating and stirring until the mixture becomes hot but do not allow it to reach a boil yet. This step should take several minutes."

Test the taste of the natillas after the first 2 minutes. If you can detect the taste of cornstarch, you'll need to continue heating the mixture for another minute or so.

When the egg whites are ready, stiff peaks should form when you lift the mixer out. These peaks should stand sharply without drooping. Note that the addition of egg whites is mostly found in Mexican versions of natillas. Many traditional Spanish versions do not use egg whites, and the result is a much denser custard.

Method Two: Colombian Natilla Prepare a baking dish. Spray an 8-inch (20.3-cm) glass baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. Set it aside. You won't actually bake the natilla, but you will need to pour it into the baking dish while it sets. Another option would be to prepare individual custard cups or ramekins. If you wish to remove the natilla from these dishes, grease them with a little cooking spray. If you would prefer to serve the natilla straight from these dishes, you do not need to grease them in advance. Combine the cornstarch and 1 cup (250 ml) of milk. Pour 1 cup (250 ml) of cold milk into a small mixing bowl and add the cornstarch. Whisk the two ingredients together well until the mixture is smooth, then set it aside. Combine the panela, salt, and remaining milk separately. Place the three ingredients in a medium saucepan and set it on your stove over medium-low heat. Stir the mixture for 2 to 5 minutes. The milk should become warm but should not be allowed to reach a boil yet. Panela is unrefined whole cane sugar. You can usually find it in Mexican markets or in the Mexican aisle of a large grocery store, but if you are unable to get your hands on it, dark brown sugar can be substituted. Replace the panela with dark brown sugar in even proportions. Add the spices and bring to a boil. Mix the ground cloves into the panela mixture. Drop the cinnamon sticks in, as well. Increase the heat to medium and continue cooking the mixture until it boils and dissolves all of the sugar. You may need to boil the mixture for 5 to 10 minutes before the sugar dissolves. Once the sugar dissolves, the mixture will seem less grainy. Remove and discard the cinnamon sticks as soon as this step is complete. If you would prefer a stronger cinnamon flavor, however, you can keep the cinnamon sticks in for a longer period of time but should remove them before stirring in the butter. Stir in the cornstarch mixture. Carefully pour the cornstarch mixture into the panela mixture, stirring continuously to combine the two evenly. Whisk away the lumps. Reduce the heat to low and whisk continuously for 10 to 20 minutes, or until the mixture feels notably thickened. You must whisk the mixture constantly at this point to prevent lumps from forming.
