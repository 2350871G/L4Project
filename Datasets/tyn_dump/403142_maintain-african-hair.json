Shampooing your hair several times a week or even every day strips the oil that the hair needs from the hair shaft so that it becomes drier, frizzier and more prone to breaking. African hair does not often get overly oily like Caucasian or Asian hair does when it is not washed for several days. Do not wash tangled hair, as this will make the knots even worse. Always untangle hair and then wash."
