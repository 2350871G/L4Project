Divide the measurement in 2 to find the center of the piece, then measure the distance from the top of the piece to the hanging wire. Use a piece of chalk to mark where the screw should go on your wall based on where you want the art to hang. Have a friend or family member hold the piece against the brick wall in different positions while you stand back to see where you want it to hang. If the wall is old, use a level to help you determine where to drill holes. The mortar lines on an older wall may not be even."

Wear safety goggles while drilling to protect your eyes from dust and debris. You can also drill directly into the brick, but this will require more effort and wear down your drill bit faster."

You can also use brick clips to hang wall art if the bricks in your walls have a pronounced lip to hook onto.
