The kit will have a holding tray, a number of peat pellets, labels, and a lid to create the greenhouse effect. This is a great way to grow bamboo seedlings all year round and in an indoor setting. The greenhouse that you purchase does not need to be specifically made for bamboo growing. Kits come in a variety of sizes from 6 plants up to over 70. A 50-plant greenhouse measures approximately 11 by 11 inches (28 by 28 cm). Your odds of success will improve if you choose a greenhouse with space for 50+ plants. After you buy your greenhouse, you'll notice that each pellet is already positioned in its own indention. This means that the greenhouse is ready for planting with almost no setup required."

Check any diagrams and instructions on the greenhouse package before watering or planting. Some greenhouse kits even come with self-watering setups. You might need to fill a large basin with water.

Then, pour boiling water over the pellets until it reaches the halfway point. The high temperature of the water is supposed to help sterilize the pellets. The ideal water temperature for watering your pellets is 10 to 15 \u00b0C (50 to 59 \u00b0F). You can also use distilled water for your seedlings to minimize any contaminants."

        "It's fine to place multiple pellets in a single pot, as long as they are not directly touching.",
        "If a pellet doesn't have a visible sprout, you can still transplant it and hope that it will produce a plant in time.",
        "Cover each pellet with about 0.39 inches (0.99 cm) of potting soil, so that the top of the pellet is no longer visible.",
        "Place the pots in a location with at least 6 hours of indirect sunlight.",
        "Extended direct sun will continue to burn your bamboo seedlings, so make sure that your plants get about half sun, half shade.",
        "You might even need to move your pots around to ensure that they get at least 6 hours of light.",
        "The seedlings should stay a bright green color.",
        "If they turn yellow or brown, then they are getting too much sun.",
        "Growing Mature Bamboo Plants Transplant the plants from pots to open soil in the fall or winter.",
        "Use a spade to dig a hole that is roughly twice the diameter and just as deep as the current pot.",
        "Then, mix that removed soil in with potting soil to create roughly a 50-50 mixture.",
        "Gently dig around the edges of the plant in the pot and turn it upside down until it loosens.",
        "Position this plant in the newly dug out hole in the soil.",
        "Look for a potting soil that is specifically made for plants in an open-soil garden.",
        "This type of soil will have a higher dirt density, as compared to standard potting soil.",
        "Water your new bamboo plants 2-3 times a week.",
        "Bamboo does best in soil that is moist, but well drained.",
        "If water is sitting on the surface of the dirt, then your bamboo may begin to rot.",
        "You can test the drainage of the soil beforehand by observing how it looks after a rain shower.",
        "If the water doesn't fully drain off and stays on the soil's surface, then it's probably not the best place to plant.",
        "Remove pests by hand or treat the plant with a pesticide.",
        "Some pests, such as aphids, are easily visible on bamboo.",
        "Simply pluck these tiny, green insects off the plant with your fingers and apply a pesticide to keep them from coming back.",
        "Other pests, such as mealybugs, are resistant to pesticides.",
        "In these situations, it's often best to simply spray the pests off the plants with a steady stream of water.",
        "Keep the area around your plant's stem free of debris to prevent disease.",
        "Before you water your bamboo, use your hand to gently brush away any dead sticks or leaves on the top of the soil.",
        "These pieces of debris can spread dangerous fungi to your plant, which can cause root rot.",
        "Also, avoid over-watering your plants, as fungi grow best in saturated soil.",
        "If your plant begins to bend at the stem and feels overly moist to the touch, then it may be suffering from rot.",
        "Dig up this plant in order to prevent the spread of the fungi."
