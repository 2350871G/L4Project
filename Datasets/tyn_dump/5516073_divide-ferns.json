Rhizomatous roots are thick, underground stems from which smaller fibrous roots grow. Your fern may have sections of thick, fleshy roots with fine roots growing from them. Ostrich ferns (Matteuccia struthiopteris) are commonly grown ferns with rhizomatous roots. Once the soil is washed off, the fern\u2019s roots may appear as a mass of fine, fibrous roots growing from the center of the fern. These are clump-forming roots. Royal fern (Osmunda regalis) is one of the fern species that has a clump-forming root system. A spreading root system is somewhat similar to a clumping root system but the roots originate from all over the entire underside of the fern rather than just the center. Sword fern (Polystichum munitum) is a commonly grown species that has a spreading root system."
