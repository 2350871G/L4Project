Use hog panels, which are thick-gauged fences that prevent the pigs from getting out, and make the pen so it\u2019s an oblong rectangle. After you put in the hog panels, you can choose to put electrical fencing around its perimeter to discourage the pigs from trying to get out. If you plan on building the pen on concrete, provide at least 6 inches (15 cm) of dirt on the ground to protect the pigs\u2019 legs and hooves.
