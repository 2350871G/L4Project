Always have these supplies on hand so that you can respond whenever an emergency arises. Try getting canned food that doesn't require any added water or milk, such as Progresso. Fill up the bathtub with water if you decide to stay home. An average bathtub full of water holds enough water for about three days. It also makes it possible to flush the toilet using a bucket. There is a lot of water in the hot water heater of your home. An average 150-liter water heater has enough water to keep a single person alive for a month. See here for details. An average person needs about 3.5 l of water (one gallon) per day. Pets (dogs) need about 1.75L of water per day. Cats need much less water."

        "Secure your windows.",
        "Close all of your doors and windows.",
        "If you don\u2019t own hurricane shutters, board up your home\u2019s doors and windows with plywood.",
