If you want to make sure that this is indeed the case, refer to a heating or air specialist to get a second opinion. Checking a Car\u2019s AC Compressor Turn off your vehicle. Turn off the engine so that the moving parts under your hood are stationary. If your engine or internal parts are hot, wait for them to cool down before checking your compressor. Open the hood of your car and locate your AC compressor clutch. The compressor clutch will usually be located under your hood on the left side near the front of your car. It will look like a cylindrical metal piece with tubes and wires running from it. Examine the compressor for damage. Compressors are prone to rust on older vehicles. Check the compressor itself for holes or rust damage. You should also check the tubing and wires to make sure that they aren\u2019t disconnected, frayed, or damaged. If they are, you can replace them more cheaply than it would cost to get an entirely new compressor. Disconnect the wires running from your battery to the AC compressor. There should be wires running from the top or side of the compressor. The white wire is your live wire that carries electric current, while the black wire is your ground wire. Press on the sides of the plastic fittings and pull on the wires to remove them. This should reveal the contacts that you\u2019ll use to test the compressor. Insert the multimeter pins into the plastic fittings to get a reading. Set your multimeter to continuity and place the pins on the contacts. Setting the dial on your multimeter to continuity will test if current is properly running through your compressor clutch. Replace the coil if the reading is below 3 ohms or above 5 ohms. If you get a reading of 0 ohms, it means that your wires are bad and you\u2019ll have to get them replaced. If your reading is over 5 ohms, it most likely means that you have a bad coil, and your diodes will need to be checked by a mechanic. Connect your AC compressor clutch to a 12-volt battery to see if it engages. Connect your negative, or black battery cable with the grounded contact in the compressor. Then, attach the black wire to the negative side of the battery. Connect the positive, or red wire, to the positive side of the battery.
