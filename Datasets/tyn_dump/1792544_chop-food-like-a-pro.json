                    "description": "You can choose cutting boards made from wood, bamboo, or plastic. Plastic is lightweight and easy to store, but it can be difficult to clean. You'll need to discard any plastic cutting boards that develop knife scars or ridges. Wood cutting boards have natural antiseptic properties that can help keep them clean. You can also use bamboo, but since it's harder than wood, it may dull your knives faster. Avoid chopping on metal, glass, or stone cutting boards. These can dull your knives. Consider getting two cutting boards. Use one to chop vegetables or fruit and use the other to chop meat."

This could cause the knife to slip and cut you. To keep the cutting board in place, lay a damp cloth on the work surface. Set the cutting board directly on the cloth. The board should not slide around. You could also use non-slip mats, wet paper towels, or poster putty underneath the cutting board."

                    "description": "Most knife sets include a variety of knives that you'll use for different kitchen jobs. To chop, you'll usually want to use an 8 to 10-inch (20 to 25 cm) chef's knife. It has a slight curve, so you can rock the knife back and forth as you quickly chop. The knife should feel a little heavy and balanced when you hold it. Don't chop food with small knives (like paring knives) since the knife could become stuck in the food or you may cut yourself. Avoid using it for small jobs, like peeling food or cutting bread."

Be in the habit of sharpening your knife blade using a sharpening stone since dull knives are more likely to slip while you're using them. This can increase your risk of cutting yourself. If you don't feel comfortable sharpening your own knives, you can send your knives away to a professional sharpening service. If the knife blade has been bent off center because of frequent use, you can also use a honing steel to push the blade back into balance."

Gripping the blade will give you more control as you chop. While you can still chop while completely holding the handle with your entire hand, you won't have the best range of movement.

The knuckles on your thumb and fingertips should be closer to the knife blade than the fingertips. This way, your knife will simply bump against the knuckles instead of cutting the fingertips if you chop quickly. Practice keeping your thumb tucked in. If you notice your thumb sticking out while you're cutting, stop and tuck your thumb in again. Practice while going a little slower until it becomes a habit."
