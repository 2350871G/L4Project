The water is intended to hydrate the pumpkin flesh and prevent it from drying out too quickly. The bleach is an antimicrobial agent that will kill most of the surface bacteria and mold spores on the pumpkin. You can soak the pumpkin up to 8 hours, but soaking it too long can actually infuse the flesh with too much moisture, making it more prone to rot."

        "If necessary, gently scrub the pumpkin with a vegetable brush to remove dirt and debris from the surface.",
        "Soap is not necessary, nor is it advised.",
        "Cut the pumpkin into chunks.",
        "Use a large serrated knife to cut the pumpkin in half.",
        "Then, cut each half into 2- to 3-inch (5- to 7.6-cm) chunks.",
        "A serrated knife is recommended.",
        "A smooth blade is more likely to slip against the tough skin of the pumpkin, which could cause you to accidentally cut yourself.",
        "You could peel the pumpkin chunks before boiling them, but waiting until after the pumpkin has been cooked will be easier.",
        "Boil the pumpkin until soft.",
        "Place the pumpkin chunks in a medium saucepan and cover them with water.",
        "Boil the pumpkin for about 25 to 30 minutes, or until the flesh feels tender.",
        "You could also bake the pumpkin.",
        "Cut the pumpkin in half and place each half, face-down, in a baking dish.",
        "Cover with foil and cook in an oven preheated to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius) for 1.5 hours.",
        "Remove the pulp.",
        "Let the cooked pumpkin cool enough for you to handle it.",
        "Scrape the pulp from rind and transfer it to a medium bowl.",
        "Use a metal spoon or similarly rigid utensil to dig out the flesh.",
        "Once cooked, the flesh should separate from the skin with relative ease.",
        "Mash the pulp.",
        "Use a potato masher to mash the already soft pulp into a puree.",
        "You could also accomplish this task with a hand-held immersion blender or a food processor.",
        "Cool the pumpkin.",
        "Place the bowl or pan containing the pumpkin in cold water until the pumpkin puree cools to room temperature.",
        "Do not allow excess water to get into the mashed pumpkin.",
        "Stir the mashed pumpkin occasionally as it cools.",
        "Pack the pumpkin into rigid containers.",
        "Use containers made from non-reactive materials like plastic or glass.",
        "Make sure that the containers are approved for freezer use.",
        "Leave at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of empty headspace in between the top of the pumpkin and the top of container.",
        "This will allow the pumpkin to expand as it freezes.",
        "Tightly seal the containers before freezing them.",
        "Freeze the pumpkin until ready to use.",
        "The pumpkin should last about 3 to 6 months without developing any change in flavor or texture.",
        "At best, you may even be able to keep the pumpkin for over a year."
