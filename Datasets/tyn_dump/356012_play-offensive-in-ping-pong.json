Think of it as 'pulling the ball back up with the paddle'. This is especially what makes the loop such a tough stroke. As the ball touches the paddle for only a short time, as well as meeting on a more perpendicular path(as opposed to the highly parallel paths during a drive), good timing is critical to avoid completely missing the ball altogether.

A relaxed posture is doubly important for loops, both your speed and consistency will improve if you can go through the swing 'naturally'.
