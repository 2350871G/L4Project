This is a higher temperature than is normally recommended and allows the moisture in the milk to evaporate, resulting in a thicker yoghurt. If you have one, use a double boiler as this will make it easier to maintain the temperature with little stirring. Make sure to use an accurate thermometer that covers the temperature range 90-212\u00baF (30-100\u00baC) and do not let the milk get too hot or become scorched. A candy thermometer is great for this."
