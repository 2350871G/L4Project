                    "description": "Vachetta leather is very light to start, but as it\u2019s exposed to wear and tear, it typically darkens, developing a darker tan color known as a patina. The leather stains more easily when it\u2019s light, so you may want to help the patina along by placing the leather in the sun for an hour or so each day to develop a tan color that won't show stains as easily. It can take two to three weeks of regular sunning for the vachetta leather to develop an even patina."

Avoid repellent products that must be painted or brushed on, though, because they may darken the vachetta.
