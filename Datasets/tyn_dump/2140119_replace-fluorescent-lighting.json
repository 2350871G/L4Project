You can give the lamp a gentle tug to ensure that it is firmly in place. Repeat this process with the other lamp. Most often, fluorescent light fixtures are designed with two tubes side-by-side. The process for replacing each tube is the same. Test the new bulb. Flip the fuse box switch back on, then flip your wall switch on. See if the new fluorescent bulbs light up properly, noting that fluorescent lamps take a minute or so to reach full brightness. If the new bulbs do not work properly, you may have a defective component in your light fixture that needs to be replaced. Troubleshooting Problems Change out cracked sockets.

The bulb may not be getting enough power. Try resetting the fuse box by flipping the power switch off and on. If the bulb is still flickering, try replacing the bulb. Working with Office or Recessed Lighting Check for light frames. Office lighting is usually behind a bezel lens with a frame. These types of recessed fixtures are holding the light tubes in place to minimize accidents and breakage. They can be very frustrating due to the lack of wiggle room or freedom of movement. The frame is held in place by lever locks or snaps that you have to take out. Remove the cover. First, use a screwdriver to pry down the levers, while supporting the frame in the middle. It is important to support the frame because it can ruin the locks or swing down and hit you in the head. Clean the fixture. Take the opportunity, while the lens is down, to remove insects, dust, condensation or mold from the lens surface. Take out the bulb. Depending on the bulb, you will either need to twist, or unsnap, each end of the fluorescent tube. Be sure to only do one end at a time to maintain more control over the bulb.

Push the tube straight up into the sockets, and then rotate it 90 degrees until you feel it lock into place. You can give the lamp a gentle tug to ensure that it is firmly in place. Finish the job. When the last tube is in, swing the lens frame back in. Use both hands to support the frame in place. Then, use your thumbs to swing the frame lock back in.
