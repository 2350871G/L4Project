Count to three so the glue becomes tacky, and using tweezers, gently pick the rhinestone up and push into your desired spot on your cap. Rhinestones and a glue gun can be picked up at most dollar or craft stores. They come in a huge assortment of sizes and colors, so get creative. If you don\u2019t have a steady enough hand for applying rhinestones, invest in a pre-made embellishment. These will often have several rhinestones in the shape of words or pictures with one, solid, tacky back, so they can be applied all together."
