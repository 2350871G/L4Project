If you want to save time and wash your baby's bottles and other pacifiers at the same time, use a clean, plastic tub or sink instead. You should wash the nipple part before giving the WubbaNub to your baby for the first time, even if you just took it out of the packaging. Add some mild, liquid soap. You should use the same type of soap you use to clean your baby's bottles and pacifiers. Dip the nipple into the water. Swirl it around. If the nipple part is very grimy, you may need to rub it between your fingers. Rinse the nipple off with warm water. This will help remove any surface dirt on the nipple. Keep rinsing the nipple until no soap residue remains. Sterilize the nipple in boiling water, necessary. Fill a cup with boiled water. Place the nipple into the cup. Let it sit there for 2 to 4 minutes, then take the nipple out. You must do this before giving the WubbaNub to your baby for the first time. Plan on sterilizing the nipple once a month.

Washing the Entire WubbaNub Place the WubbaNub in a mesh laundry bag or lingerie bag. You do not have to clean the WubbaNub in the washing machine every time\u2014only when the plushie part is dirty. Place the WubbaNub into the washing machine. You can save time, water, and detergent by adding all of your baby's other items into the washing machine as well. Do not use a dishwasher. Add a baby-safe detergent. You can use whatever detergent your normally use to wash your baby's cloths, but it would be much better if you use a gentle, baby-safe detergent, however. This is because babies have sensitive skin and can get rashes from regular detergents. Set and start the laundry cycle. Select your desire water temperature, then set the cycle to gentle.
