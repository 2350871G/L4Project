    ],
    "text": " Assembling the Units Choose a color scheme for your espiral. You can choose anywhere between 1-4 colors to include in your project. For example, you could use 4 sheets of the same color for a monochromatic look. However, the layering in this project looks even more impressive and eye-catching with multiple colors! Try a dual color scheme, which requires 2 sheets in 1 color and 2 sheets in another color, or go for a rainbow effect with 4 sheets, each one in a different color. If it\u2019s your first time making this project, try using 4 different colors. This will make it easier to tell the pieces apart! Gather your 4 square sheets of origami paper. You can use any size you want, but a 6 by 6 in (15 by 15 cm) square generally works best because it will let you fold several full rotations. Origami paper works best for this project, but you can use any kind of paper as long as it\u2019s thin and stiff enough to hold a crease. For example, you could use printer paper or sketching paper. Avoid using cardstock or construction paper, which are too thick for creating multiple folds. If your papers aren\u2019t square already, you can cut them down to squares by folding the upper right corner of the paper down until it lines up with the left edge of the paper. Carefully cut off the excess paper at the bottom. Lay 1 square in front of you, white side up. If you\u2019re using origami paper, the colored side of the paper should be facedown. If you\u2019re using a different kind of paper, make a small pencil mark on the side facing up. This will help you remember which side should be face-up as you fold. Fold each square in half diagonally and open it back up. Fold point-to-point diagonally, running your finger along the folded edge to make a clean crease. Open the paper back up so it\u2019s flat with 1 crease running down the middle. Fold the paper in half diagonally in the opposite direction and open it up. Run your finger along the line to create another firm crease, then open up the paper again. The 2 creases will form an \u201cX\u201d shape on the paper. Lay the paper in front of you again, white side facing up. Turn the paper so it\u2019s oriented like a diamond shape (with the points facing up and down), rather than a square. If you\u2019re not using origami paper, make sure the side with the small mark is facing up. Fold the bottom right side up to meet the center crease. Keeping the square oriented like a diamond, bring the bottom point up and to the left. Line up the bottom right edge with the horizontal crease in the middle of the paper. Run your finger over the fold to crease it so the paper will stay folded down. Copy this fold with the upper left-hand edge. Line the top left edge up with the center crease, bringing the top point down and to the right. Once you have the paper folded down, crease it cleanly to keep it in place. At this point, the shape will look like a parallelogram. Fold the top right edge down to line up with the center crease. Make sure the edges align, then fold and crease. This fold will form a central point along the top half of the shape. Repeat this fold on the bottom with the lower left edge. Bring the edge in line with the center crease, lining up the 2 edges neatly. Press down on the fold to make a clean crease. Fold the 2 sides in half to create 1 triangular shape. Run your finger along the flat edge of the triangle to crease the fold and keep the whole unit folded together. Place the triangle shape in front of you with the flat edge on the bottom and the point on top. Fold the triangle in half, bringing the left side over to the right. Fold along this line cleanly and then unfold it, leaving a crease behind. Now your triangle should have a line straight down the middle to help align the next folds. Fold over the left edge to line up with the center crease. Bring the left side of the triangle over to the center. Line up its top edge with the triangle\u2019s center crease. Once you have it in place, press the fold down to crease it. At this stage in the folding process, your shape should have 1 point pointing downwards and 1 pointing out to the right. Flip the paper over and repeat the fold on the other side. With the fold you just made facing down, fold the remaining side of the triangle over to line up with the center crease. The sides of the 2 edges facing downward should line up side-by-side. This completes 1 unit! Repeat the process on the other 3 papers to form 4 units in total. Remember to line your edges up and make your folds as clean as possible. Once you\u2019ve finished 4 identical units, you\u2019re ready to start putting them together. Putting the Pieces Together Unfold the units back to their triangle shape. This will leave them with 3 creases: the center crease, the side crease that angles downward, which is called a valley fold, and the side crease that angles upward, which is called a mountain fold. By the end of the project, all of the mountain folds will be hidden. Pick 2 of the units and place them side by side vertically. Line them up with the long, flat edges facing each other. For the purpose of explaining, we\u2019ll call these units A and B. If you\u2019re making a dual-color design, use 2 units in the same color paper. If you\u2019re using 4 different colors, just pick any 2. Add a third unit horizontally, sliding it over unit A and under unit B. For the purpose of explaining, we\u2019ll call this unit C. Lift up the top of unit B to slide C beneath it. This will hide unit C\u2019s mountain fold and start the layered folding process. Once it\u2019s in place, line up the flat edge of this unit with A and B\u2019s horizontal middle crease. Set the last unit under A and over B, with its flat edge against C\u2019s. For the purpose of explaining, we\u2019ll call this unit D. Unit D\u2019s mountain fold is on the left side, so you need to tuck it under the first triangle. To do this, slide unit D under A and leave it above B. Adjust the 4 units so all of the edges line up and the pointed ends are aligned. At this point, the 4 units should create an interlocked cross shape. Folding the Spiral Re-fold along the valley fold of unit D. Now that everything is in place, you can start re-folding each of the units' valley folds. Start with the point on the bottom right-hand side, unit D. Fold along its original valley fold, so the point goes upward and the long edge lines up along the center. Repeat this step with the other units, working clockwise. Next, you\u2019ll fold along the valley line for unit A, bringing its point up to the right and keeping its long edge in line with the center. Do the same thing with unit C, re-folding its valley fold so the point comes downward and its long edge is flush with the center line. Lift up unit D\u2019s folded piece and re-fold unit B\u2019s valley fold beneath it. Since unit B\u2019s valley fold has been hidden by the other piece, you\u2019ll need to lift the first piece we folded out of the way. Fold along unit B\u2019s crease, bringing its point downward and it\u2019s long edge in line with the center. Lay unit D back over the top of unit B when you\u2019ve finished the fold. This completes 1 rotation. Repeat the process, this time making your own valley folds. Starting at the top right-hand corner again and working clockwise, fold each piece over so its long edge matches up with the center line. Remember to lift the first piece out of the way for the last piece each time, then lay it back down on top. Keep folding until you get to the tips of the paper. Complete as many rotations as you can until the ends become too small to fold. With 6 by 6 in (15 by 15 cm) paper, you\u2019ll likely be able to do 3-4 rotations. Turn the project over and repeat this entire process on the other side. To complete the espiral, you\u2019ll need to finish the other side as well! Hold the tips on the completed side carefully in place as you flip the whole project over. Repeat the process, starting with the top right-hand piece and working clockwise until the ends are too small to fold. Pinch the 2 sides by the folded ends and twist, then pull slightly. Twist the ends in a clockwise direction until they hold together. This will help prevent your folds from coming apart. While you\u2019re still holding the ends, gently pull the folds apart, extending the spiral so you can see each layer individually. You\u2019re done! Be careful not to pull too forcefully or too far, or the thin paper could tear.",

        "Run your finger along the flat edge of the triangle to crease the fold and keep the whole unit folded together.",
        "Place the triangle shape in front of you with the flat edge on the bottom and the point on top.",
        "Fold the triangle in half, bringing the left side over to the right.",
        "Fold along this line cleanly and then unfold it, leaving a crease behind.",
        "Now your triangle should have a line straight down the middle to help align the next folds.",
        "Fold over the left edge to line up with the center crease.",
        "Bring the left side of the triangle over to the center.",
        "Line up its top edge with the triangle\u2019s center crease.",
        "Once you have it in place, press the fold down to crease it.",
        "At this stage in the folding process, your shape should have 1 point pointing downwards and 1 pointing out to the right.",
        "Flip the paper over and repeat the fold on the other side.",
        "With the fold you just made facing down, fold the remaining side of the triangle over to line up with the center crease.",
        "The sides of the 2 edges facing downward should line up side-by-side.",
        "This completes 1 unit!",
        "Repeat the process on the other 3 papers to form 4 units in total.",
        "Remember to line your edges up and make your folds as clean as possible.",
        "Once you\u2019ve finished 4 identical units, you\u2019re ready to start putting them together.",
        "Putting the Pieces Together Unfold the units back to their triangle shape.",
        "This will leave them with 3 creases: the center crease, the side crease that angles downward, which is called a valley fold, and the side crease that angles upward, which is called a mountain fold.",
        "By the end of the project, all of the mountain folds will be hidden.",
        "Pick 2 of the units and place them side by side vertically.",
        "Line them up with the long, flat edges facing each other.",
        "For the purpose of explaining, we\u2019ll call these units A and B.",
        "If you\u2019re making a dual-color design, use 2 units in the same color paper.",
        "If you\u2019re using 4 different colors, just pick any 2.",
        "Add a third unit horizontally, sliding it over unit A and under unit B.",
        "For the purpose of explaining, we\u2019ll call this unit C. Lift up the top of unit B to slide C beneath it.",
        "This will hide unit C\u2019s mountain fold and start the layered folding process.",
        "Once it\u2019s in place, line up the flat edge of this unit with A and B\u2019s horizontal middle crease.",
        "Set the last unit under A and over B, with its flat edge against C\u2019s.",
        "For the purpose of explaining, we\u2019ll call this unit D. Unit D\u2019s mountain fold is on the left side, so you need to tuck it under the first triangle.",
        "To do this, slide unit D under A and leave it above B.",
        "Adjust the 4 units so all of the edges line up and the pointed ends are aligned.",
        "At this point, the 4 units should create an interlocked cross shape.",
        "Folding the Spiral Re-fold along the valley fold of unit D. Now that everything is in place, you can start re-folding each of the units' valley folds.",
        "Start with the point on the bottom right-hand side, unit D. Fold along its original valley fold, so the point goes upward and the long edge lines up along the center.",
        "Repeat this step with the other units, working clockwise.",
        "Next, you\u2019ll fold along the valley line for unit A, bringing its point up to the right and keeping its long edge in line with the center.",
        "Do the same thing with unit C, re-folding its valley fold so the point comes downward and its long edge is flush with the center line.",
        "Lift up unit D\u2019s folded piece and re-fold unit B\u2019s valley fold beneath it.",
        "Since unit B\u2019s valley fold has been hidden by the other piece, you\u2019ll need to lift the first piece we folded out of the way.",
        "Fold along unit B\u2019s crease, bringing its point downward and it\u2019s long edge in line with the center.",
        "Lay unit D back over the top of unit B when you\u2019ve finished the fold.",
        "This completes 1 rotation.",
        "Repeat the process, this time making your own valley folds.",
        "Starting at the top right-hand corner again and working clockwise, fold each piece over so its long edge matches up with the center line.",
        "Remember to lift the first piece out of the way for the last piece each time, then lay it back down on top.",
        "Keep folding until you get to the tips of the paper.",
        "Complete as many rotations as you can until the ends become too small to fold.",
        "With 6 by 6 in (15 by 15 cm) paper, you\u2019ll likely be able to do 3-4 rotations.",
        "Turn the project over and repeat this entire process on the other side.",
        "To complete the espiral, you\u2019ll need to finish the other side as well!",
        "Hold the tips on the completed side carefully in place as you flip the whole project over.",
        "Repeat the process, starting with the top right-hand piece and working clockwise until the ends are too small to fold.",
        "Pinch the 2 sides by the folded ends and twist, then pull slightly.",
        "Twist the ends in a clockwise direction until they hold together.",
        "This will help prevent your folds from coming apart.",
        "While you\u2019re still holding the ends, gently pull the folds apart, extending the spiral so you can see each layer individually.",
        "You\u2019re done!",
        "Be careful not to pull too forcefully or too far, or the thin paper could tear."
