Start with the oldest bond first; in most cases the earliest savings bond will be closest to maturity, unless your bonds are from multiple series. Check the interest rates each bond is earning. The rate of the interest was determined at the time you purchased the bond. The easiest way to find out the rate is to use the calculator on the U.S. Treasury's website. Series EE bonds, from the 1980s and 1990s, have an extended maturity of 10 years beyond the 20-year base. These savings bonds accrue interest for a total of 30 years, and so have the potential to be worth more than their face value. Consider time of year for bonds bought before May 1997. These bonds accrue interest every 6 months, so you will lose half a year's interest if you cash them right before they have completed a cycle. Cash them for your emergency if they have recently completed a cycle."

If your area has been affected by flood, fire, hurricane, or tornado, check the Press Releases section of the US Treasury website to see if you are eligible to redeem bonds that are less than a year old. If you co-own a bond, you can cash the bond independently of its co-owner. If you are currently in another country, you will need to sign your request in the presence of the appropriate official. This official could be a US diplomatic or consular representative, an officer of a foreign branch of a bank that is incorporated in the US or US territory, or a notary. if you are in a country that is not included in the Hague Convention, a U.S. diplomatic or consular officer must approve the official's character and jurisdiction.
