Your sub-woofers should also be labeled with an impedance value (in Ohms) and a value indicating the maximum power input that they can handle (in Watts).

You want the impedance to be at least equal to the minimum impedance value of your amp on each channel, but not to exceed 16 Ohms unless your amp is specifically rated for impedance values above 16 Ohms. The formula for finding total impedance for speakers wired in series is Z1 + Z2 + Z3 \u2026. = Ztotal. Where Z is the impedance of a given speaker. For example, if you have three speakers with impedance values of 4 Ohms, 6 Ohms, and 8 Ohms your total impedance wired in series would be 18 Ohms (4+6+8=18). The formula for finding total impedance of speakers wired in parallel is a little trickier. It is (Z1 x Z2 x Z3\u2026) / (Z1 + Z2 + Z3\u2026) =Ztotal. So say you have two speakers with impedances of 6 Ohms and 8 Ohms. This time it would look like this: 1) Multiply the values. 6 x 8 = 48 Ohms 2) Add the values. 6 + 8 = 14 Ohms 3) Divide the top by the bottom to find your total impedance. 48/14 = 3.43 Ohms (rounded)\nYou can also use an impedance calculator such as this one http://www.speakerimpedance.co.uk/."
