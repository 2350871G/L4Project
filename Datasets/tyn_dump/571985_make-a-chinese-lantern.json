If the lantern caves in on itself, simply reach inside, and pop it back out into shape. At this point, you can also use some scissors to clean up the edges of the tissue paper. Use a hole puncher to poke two holes in the top of the lantern. They need to be straight across from each other, or the lantern won't balance right. Thread a long piece of string through both holes. Tie the ends of the string together into a tight knot. Insert the light and hang the lantern. Switch on a battery-operated tea light and drop it into the lantern. You don't want to use a real candle or a light bulb, as both can lead to a fire. Use the string to hang the lantern. Make a Chinese Lantern Candle Holder Gather your supplies. This lantern is a little bit different from the rest. You can't hang it anywhere, because it is made from glass. You can, however, use it as a real candleholder. Try not to get it wet, however; you can wipe it clean with a damp cloth, but if you leave it sitting in water, the Mod Podge will flake off. Here's what you'll need to make this lantern:\nShort, squat jar\nRed tissue paper\nMod Podge\nPaintbrush or foam brush\nPaper plate or palette\nScissors\nBlack paint\nGold glitter, glue, sequins, markers, etc (optional) Find a short, squat jar. You want the jar to be low with a wide mouth. It should be almost round or square in shape. Clean the jar well, and dry it off. Use soap and warm water to wash it. You can also wipe it down with a cotton ball soaked in some rubbing alcohol. If there are any labels on the jar, be sure to remove them, or they will show up when you are done. Cut or tear red tissue paper into small pieces. The pieces should be proportionate to the jar. For a very small jar, make the pieces about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) big. For a larger jar, try something that is about 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) big. Paint the entire jar using Mod Podge. You can use a paintbrush or a foam brush. If you are working on a large jar, you can paint a small section first. If you don't have any Mod Podge, you can mix one part white school glue with one part water. Cover the entire jar with tissue paper, including the neck. Use your fingers or your paintbrush/foam brush to smooth the paper down so that you don't get any wrinkles. Try not to overlap the tissue paper too much, or the light won't shine through as well. It's okay if the tissue paper extends past the neck. You want the next to be covered, so that the paint will have something to stick to. Wait for the jar to dry, then paint it with another layer of Mod Podge. This will seal the jar. Trim the excess tissue paper off. Use your scissors to trim off the excess tissue paper from the top of the jar. Paint the top edge/neck of the jar black. Squirt some black paint out onto a paper plate or a palette. Dip your paintbrush into the paint, and paint the entire neck of the jar black. This will resemble the top of the lantern. Decorate the jar. Use a black marker or glitter glue to draw some symbols onto the lantern. You can use Chinese characters, dragons, yin-yang, and so forth. You can also glue on some sequins or loose glitter onto the lantern as well. Let the lantern dry completely before you use it. You can use a real tea light inside the lantern, or a battery-operated tea light.",
