If they are lined up correctly, the point of the square will be sticking straight out from the center of the curve. Mark where each side where the curve ends on the square. Measure between each of those points and the point of the square. This measurement is the radius of your curve. In order to bend a piece of Formica without heat, the curve needs to be a certain size or the Formica will crack. It is generally agreed upon that a curve that is less 3 inches (7.6 cm) is very likely to crack."

For small jobs, you can cut the Formica with a utility knife and a metal straightedge. Work from the back and score the line deeply. Cut again, and then hit the shorter end of the Formica against a solid surface to break it off. For big jobs with lots of cuts, use an electric saw, again working from the back.

The goal is to just take off enough of the backing so that the Formica will bend easier. This will be a very thin layer of material. In order to take off the right amount, check the flexibility of the Formica after every few strokes with the sandpaper. Once the Formica starts bending more easily, stop standing. Use a sandpaper that is between 60 and 100 grit to ensure that you can easily get some of the backing removed. Do your sanding outside and wear a dust mask while you do it. The dust can irritate your mouth, nose, and lungs if you inhale it.Tip: Once the Formica begins to bend a little easier, stop sanding. You don't want to take off so much material that you weaken the Formica dramatically."

        "Measure the curve you want to cover with a flexible measuring tape.",
        "Transfer those measurements onto the back of a piece of Formica that is big enough to cover the entire curve.",
        "Double check your measurements one more time and then cut out the piece with a utility knife or electric saw, leaving an extra \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) on each side to give yourself some wiggle room.",
        "While cutting out the Formica you should wear eye protection.",
        "Also, if you are using an electric saw, consider wearing a dust mask as well.",
        "Apply the adhesive to both surfaces.",
        "Put some on the back of the Formica and on to the surface where it will be applied.",
        "Place the Formica face down on a clean, solid surface.",
        "Use a brush or a roller to apply your adhesive to the entire surface while trying to not get a lot of it dripping over the edges.",
        "Also apply the adhesive to the surface of the curve right away.",
        "In most cases, you can use contact cement as your adhesive, although there are specialty products made specifically for applying laminates like Formica.Tip: Read and follow the directions on the adhesive packaging before applying it.",
        "This will let you know how to properly apply the adhesive and how much time you will have before you need to get it into place.",
        "Put on heat resistant work gloves and get out your heat source.",
        "Leather work gloves tend to work great for protecting your hands and having some dexterity while you work.",
        "To heat the Formica you can use a heat gun or an iron.",
        "Whichever you use, it needs to be able to heat the Formica to a temperature between 315 \u00b0F (157 \u00b0C) and 325 \u00b0F (163 \u00b0C).",
        "This is the temperature window when the Formica will become pliable.",
        "If you use an iron, use one that you don't need to use on clothes in the future.",
        "There is a risk that the iron will get dirty and that you will get glue on the heating surface while you use it.",
        "Clamp one end of the Formica in place.",
        "Position the end so that it is in the exact position you would like it in when the project is finished.",
        "Use a clamp to attach it to the curved surface so that it won't move as you put tension on it.",
        "You can use any clamps you have on hand that will fit over the curve and the Formica, including c-clamps, bar clamps, or spring clamps.",
        "However, if the pads on the clamp are metal, put something between the pad and the Formica so that it doesn't get scratched.",
        "The easiest thing to use is a small piece of cardboard.",
        "Heat small sections and then attach them right away.",
        "Run your heat gun or iron over a section of Formica that is 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) long.",
        "Once you can feel that the area is flexible, push it firmly onto the curved surface.",
        "Keep working down the curve this way, heating small sections and then attaching them.",
        "Use your gloved hand or a J-roller to press the Formica firmly onto the curved surface.",
        "Run your hand over the surface to ensure that there are no air bubbles underneath, that it is in the right position, and that the piece is securely attached.",
        "Attach clamps as you go to ensure that the Formica stays securely attached while the adhesive cures.Tip: Try cutting a scrap piece of Formica and practice using the heat gun or iron on it to see how long it takes to become pliable before starting on the big project.",
        "Allow the adhesive to cure before trimming off any excess.",
        "Follow the adhesive manufacturer's directions for drying time.",
        "Once enough time has passed, use a router, saw, or utility knife to remove any excess Formica along the edges."
