Pre-drill two holes and place a couple of deck screws through the scrap piece, into the floor. This provides a 'hard stop' for the desk on one side. Position one of the dollies (flat, 4 wheels, available from hardware stores) on one side near your wide stance feet. Lift the desk end, by pushing on the side of the desk opposite where the floor cleat is, holding the desk from sliding. Brace the desk up with your body. Carefully glide the square dolly under the lifted end of the desk. The dolly has carpet fabric attached to it, so it provides a 'grip' on the heavy desk.
