Your local garden store can help you select one. Cut the base off of the leaf. Set the leaf onto a cutting board, then cut off the very bottom of the leaf with a sharp knife.

Slice the leaf apart lengthwise. Make sure that you are cutting the leaf apart from edge-to-edge, like cutting a roll for a sandwich. You'll end up with two, long, skinny halves of aloe vera leaf.
