Wear heavy-duty gloves, protective goggles, a dust mask, and long sleeves and pants. That way, you\u2019ll avoid eye, skin, or respiratory inhalation due to the chemicals. When you choose a product, read the label closely for specific safety instructions. Even if a product isn\u2019t harmful to humans, like diatomaceous earth, it\u2019s best to protect yourself.

                    "description": "Before you use dangerous pesticides, opt for a safer treatment. Following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, use a hand duster or a large scoop to sprinkle diatomaceous earth around the base of your boxelder or maple trees. Then, scatter more powder around the perimeter of your home, being especially generous around doorways and windows. You\u2019ll need to reapply this treatment after it rains or if the bugs come back. Diatomaceous earth is non-toxic to humans and pets, but it is lethal to boxelder bugs. That\u2019s because the fine silica-based powder affects insects\u2019 exoskeletons, leading to their death. You can use Borax instead of diatomaceous earth, if you\u2019d like. This boron-based compound is also safe to use around the home."
