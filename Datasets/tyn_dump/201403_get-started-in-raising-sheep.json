Some people even like to raise sheep as a replacement for empty nest syndrome. It is important to understand from the outset that you cannot try to do everything with this multi-purpose animal because different breeds are more suited to one aspect or other and the pasture, feed and production practices will vary according to what you want the sheep for. Unless you have the necessary time, appropriate experience, adequate resources and appropriate pasture, don't over-extend!"
