                    "description": "New oil fields are most easily found where oil is already being drilled. There are a number of ways to test for oil. Soil gas surveys can assist in the discovery of oil. These surveys measure a soil sample for trace amounts of light hydrocarbons (the tell-tale chemical signals of oil). Soil gas surveys should be the first option when investigating whether a region contains oil because the test is relatively low-cost. Seismic imaging can also help locate oil deposits. Seismologists, armed with devices known as geophones, can bounce sound waves off underground rock and listen to the echoes the sound waves produce. Analyzing the echo patterns can provide accurate imagery of subsurface geology, including pockets of oil and other fossil fuels."

        "Remove the drill and insert casing pipe into the conductor hole.",
        "Casing pipe is a long metal tube inserted into the well to the depth at which the oil company believe oil can be found.",
        "Fill the space between the rock and casing pipe with cement.",
        "This will protect the water table, aquifers, and surrounding soils from contamination.",
        "Let the cement harden.",
        "Determine if the reservoir rock (the rock layer in which the presence of oil is suspected to exist) has been reached.",
        "To do so, test rock samples, measure pressure, and lower gas sensors into the well hole.",
        "Drill deeper if the desired depth has not been reached.",
        "Stop drilling when the rock cuttings contain signs of oil sand from the reservoir rock.",
        "Some modern drills contain Measurement While Drilling (MWD) technology which relays important information about the well to the surface.",
        "MWD technology saves time since it does not require the removal of the drill each time measurements need to be taken.",
        "Insert small diameter tubing and a perforating gun into the hole.",
        "The small diameter tubing will allow oil to flow up the length of the well.",
        "The perforating gun, when fired, will punch holes through the casing and cement, allowing trapped oil into the well.",
        "Consider the next steps.",
        "If the well yields oil, continue on to well completion by removing the BOP and installing a pump jack or production well-head (a \"Christmas tree\").",
        "If the well is not productive, seal it off with cement plugs and drilling mud.",
        "In either case, disassemble and remove the rig."
