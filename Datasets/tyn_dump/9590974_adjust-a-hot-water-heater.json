Most water heaters will already be set to this temperature when they\u2019re installed. To limit the risk of injury, it\u2019s best to just leave it alone in most cases.

On the majority of gas water heaters, the lower temperature range will be somewhere around 90\u2013110 \u00b0F (32\u201343 \u00b0C), while the upper range will top out at around 140\u2013150 \u00b0F (60\u201366 \u00b0C). The dial on your gas water heater may not be numbered, which can make finding the perfect temperature a little tricky. One simple way around this is to take the temperature of the water a few times after altering your settings, then tag the exact degree reading or mark it on the dial itself."
