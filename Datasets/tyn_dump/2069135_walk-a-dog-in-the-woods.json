Either way, it is very likely that you will encounter other dog owners on the trail. Be aware of other dogs and bring your dog close to your side if you see one. This is especially important if one dog is leashed while the other is unleashed. Unleashed dogs can become combative. Check with other owners before allowing your dog to interact with theirs. Rein your dog in at the first sign of aggression from either side, whether your dog is unleashed or on a long leash. Also be aware of other animals in the woods, like squirrels and deer. If you see a woodland creature, recall your dog before they notice it, or pull the leash in. Reward your dog with a treat if they obey and don't get in a scuffle with other dogs."

For example, you can make your own dog trail mix with leftover meat scraps.

Keep your dog by your side when walking on a leash. Their head should be raised and show that they are paying attention. Your dog should be walking at the same speed as you.

Then when it is time for them to come back to you, you can pull them in if they don\u2019t respond. This is called recall training. It is important to reward your pet each time they come when you call. A treat with each \u201ccheck-in\u201d tells them that coming when you say their name is a good thing. Look at treats on the trail as payment for checking in. It is like being rewarded with $20 for giving your teacher a high five every 5 minutes.

Toss the stick or toy gently down the trail, making sure that you can keep it in sight. This may be difficult with a stick in the forest, so choose a unique one. You can try tossing a Frisbee instead since a brightly colored disc may be easier for your dog to see. Dogs do not see in black and white; rather, they see colors less powerfully than humans.

        "Keep an eye on the weather.",
        "Protect your pet from the elements by keeping tabs on the weather\u2014hot and cold temperatures as well as precipitation.",
        "If it\u2019s going to be very hot, it may not be wise to take your pet on a trail where they are going to exert a lot of energy.",
        "If it\u2019s going to rain, lightning may be an issue, making it dangerous for either of you to be out on a trail.",
        "Try to go on a trail during mild temperatures and on a clear day.",
        "Also pay attention to the sky and temperature when you are on the trail.",
        "A forecast of clear skies can be incorrect, as can be a forecast of mild temperatures.",
        "Pay attention to your dog\u2019s physical needs.",
        "Even if the weather is cool, your dog may get dehydrated by exerting a lot of energy.",
        "Be prepared not only with treats, but with water, a rain poncho, a backup leash, a first aid kit, and other important essentials to deal with issues in the woods.",
        "You might want to pack a bowl to pour water into.",
        "You can allow your pet to urinate and defecate on the trail, but come prepared to clean up dog feces as you go.",
        "Materials in a dog first aid kit might include:a pet first-aid manual,\nemergency veterinary phone numbers and directions,\nimportant paperwork (proof of rabies shot, perhaps a photo if they get lost),\npet bandages (a special non-stick kind for fur, available at pet stores),\na muzzle,\nother basic first aid supplies like an ice pack, gauze, tape, antiseptic, etc.",
        "Check for ticks and fleas.",
        "After you get home, check your dog for ticks and fleas.",
        "Feel under the fur all over their body, placing enough pressure on the skin to feel for bulges that might be ticks.",
        "Look especially between the toes, around the tail and head, behind the ears, and under the armpits.",
        "Use a comb to check for fleas.",
        "If you do feel a bulge, part the fur and look for an embedded tick.",
        "Remove it by grasping it with tweezers and pulling away from the skin.",
        "If you live in an area where ticks are known to carry Lyme disease, make sure you get your dog vaccinated.",
        "Take a fine tooth metal comb and rake it through your pet's fur.",
        "Make sure you reach the skin.",
        "If fleas are on the comb, treat your dog to a flea bath to kill the fleas.",
        "Training Your Dog to Check In Look at it from your dog\u2019s perspective.",
        "Before you set off into the woods with your dog, it is important to consider how they may act.",
        "If you are prepared for them to be curious and sniff around a lot, you will be much less frustrated.",
        "Be ready for both a leisurely stroll and a fast-paced chase to keep up with your furry pal.",
        "For example, right when you arrive at a trailhead, your dog will probably sniff a lot.",
        "This is because they are examining what has happened recently.",
        "If you hurry them along, they lose the chance to become comfortable in a new environment.",
        "Later in the walk, your dog may try to chase down interesting things that they see.",
        "Be prepared to have your leash pulled or to chase your dog.",
        "Load up on dog treats.",
        "Before heading out to the woods, you need to have many treats available for training them to come back to you.",
        "Think about what treats get your pet most excited.",
        "Do they like rawhide?",
        "Dog biscuits?",
        "You can make your own treats to minimize cost and control what your dog eats.",
        "Ensure that these treats are healthy since you will need to give them a lot.",
        "For example, you can make your own dog trail mix with leftover meat scraps.",
        "You can bake your own dog biscuits with whole wheat flour, bullion granules, cheese, broth, an egg, bacon bits, and other protein-rich foods.",
        "You can make pumpkin balls for a quick treat with canned pumpkin, molasses, whole wheat flour, and spices.",
        "Just be sure whatever treat you make can be taken on the trail without making a mess in your pocket.",
        "Consult your veterinarian about what treats are most healthy for your dog.",
        "Have control when letting them out of the car.",
        "When you arrive at a trailhead, set the tone for a calm and controlled hike by being firm when getting out of the car.",
        "Don\u2019t allow your pet to charge wildly out of the seat.",
        "Instead, take a firm grasp of the leash, open the car, and command your dog to sit.",
        "Then command them to get out of the car.",
        "Wait until you are several yards or meters down the trail before releasing a tight hold on the leash.",
        "This control prevents your pet from getting in others\u2019 ways in the parking lot and trailhead, where people are often gathered when you first start a trail.",
        "Teach your dog how to be leashed properly.",
        "If you are keeping your dog on a leash for the entire hike, you need to train them properly.",
        "Being familiar with a leash prevents frustration for both you and your dog.",
        "Your job is to assert your dominance in keeping your dog by your side instead of letting your dog walk you.",
        "Keep your dog by your side when walking on a leash.",
        "Their head should be raised and show that they are paying attention.",
        "Your dog should be walking at the same speed as you.",
        "This displays that they are aware of you and agree that you are in charge.",
        "Train your dog to do these things by using a short leash and rewarding them along the way.",
        "Train your dog to check in.",
        "As your dog becomes accustomed to walking by your side, you can start to give them gradual freedom on the trail.",
        "For example, they can be on a long leash (some people use 30-foot or 10 meter leashes) so that they feel like they are running free.",
        "Then when it is time for them to come back to you, you can pull them in if they don\u2019t respond.",
        "This is called recall training.",
        "It is important to reward your pet each time they come when you call.",
        "A treat with each \u201ccheck-in\u201d tells them that coming when you say their name is a good thing.",
        "Look at treats on the trail as payment for checking in.",
        "It is like being rewarded with $20 for giving your teacher a high five every 5 minutes.",
        "As your dog responds to being recalled, you can let the leash get longer and longer.",
        "If the trail you\u2019re on allows it, you may be able to take the leash off completely.",
        "Offer more treats in return for going back home.",
        "When it is time to get back in the car, offer more treats.",
        "This way going home isn\u2019t a tug of war or a power struggle.",
        "Seeing the leash (if they have been off of it for the hike) or the car should be a happy sign because it means more treats are about to come.",
        "After a few months, you will probably have a successfully trained dog.",
        "You may be able to reduce how many treats you give on a walk as your dog becomes accustomed to being recalled and going home.",
        "Playing Games in the Woods Give treats in return for playing fetch.",
        "As your dog gets used to coming when you call, they may actually have a hard time leaving your side because they want treats.",
        "When you notice this happening, try to train your dog to play games.",
        "These require your dog to work harder for treats.",
        "Start by rewarding your dog for retrieving a stick or chew toy.",
        "Toss the stick or toy gently down the trail, making sure that you can keep it in sight.",
        "This may be difficult with a stick in the forest, so choose a unique one.",
        "You can try tossing a Frisbee instead since a brightly colored disc may be easier for your dog to see.",
        "Dogs do not see in black and white; rather, they see colors less powerfully than humans.",
        "Thus a brightly colored toy will contrast with the browns and greens of the woods, making a toy easy to see on the trail.",
        "Give your dog a treat when they bring the toy back.",
        "Offer a treat if your dog jumps over logs.",
        "Whenever you encounter a log laying across the trail, use this as an opportunity to play a game.",
        "Pause in your hike to encourage your dog to jump over the log.",
        "Give him a treat when he does.",
        "Add to the game by rewarding them when they crawl under the log.",
        "Teach them to run around a tree.",
        "If there are any trees close to the trail with space around them for running, encourage your dog to run around them.",
        "Show your dog where to go by running around it yourself, then coaxing your dog to follow your actions.",
        "Give them a treat when they perform this game successfully.",
        "Play hide and seek.",
        "Start a game of hide and seek with your dog in the woods by hiding behind a tree.",
        "Although you can play by yourself, this game works better with two people.",
        "Have your partner hold the dog\u2019s collar while you position yourself behind a tree.",
        "Call out, \u201cWhere am I?\u201d and watch your dog try to track your voice.",
        "Have your partner let go of the collar when you call out, but retain the leash if there are leashing rules or your dog isn\u2019t fully trained to check in yet.",
        "Have a treat ready in your hand for when your dog finds you."
