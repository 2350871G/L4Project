Use a damp towel under the bowl to prevent it from moving. Continue to knead the dough using the heel of your hand for about 7 minutes. If you like, you can remove it from the bowl to knead on a table. The dough will change its texture, becoming smooth and shiny with a medium-soft consistency. After this occurs, form it into a ball and put it back into the bowl. Cover the bowl with a plastic bag (black bags work best) and allow the dough to rise for 1\u00bd to 2 hours or until the dough has doubled in size.  Once the dough is ready, \"punch\" the air out while it is still in the bowl.  Carefully collect the dough, separating it from the sides of the bowl.  Sprinkle your work space with a little flour before working more with the dough.  Shape the dough into one log and let it rest for a minute or two.  Cut it into six even portions using the knife.  Take one portion of the dough and roll it into one long, snake-like log, starting at the middle and working outwards.  Repeat with all six portions.  Lay three of the logs beside each other and join them together at one end.  Take one of the outside logs and carefully twist it, placing it into the middle. Take the other outside strand and place that one into the middle, making a braided knot. Make sure it is tight but not tight enough to stretch the dough.
