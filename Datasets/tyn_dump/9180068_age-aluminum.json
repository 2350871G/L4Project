    "text": " Bleaching Aluminum Rough up the surface with sandpaper. If you want a truly distressed and aged look, but are working with shiny, new aluminum, you can sand it down. Use 80-grit sandpaper to rough up the surface of the metal. Spray your aluminum with bleach. Wear a mask and protective gloves when working with bleach. Do this in a well-ventilated area so fumes can easily disperse. Put regular bleach in a spray bottle and spray it onto the aluminum. Let the aluminum sit in the sun for a few hours. Set the aluminum outside in the sun for several hours. The sun speeds up the process and helps the bleach distress the metal. Soon, the chemical reaction will create an aged look on your aluminum. Rinse off the bleach. Use running water to rinse the bleach off the aluminum, or soak the aluminum in a container of water for a few minutes. If your aluminum piece has electronic parts or other things that would prevent you from rinsing or submerging it in water, use a clean, white cloth to wipe the bleach off the surface of the aluminum. Putting Aluminum in the Dishwasher Wrap your aluminum piece in aluminum foil. Place your aluminum piece on a sheet of aluminum foil with the shiny side facing away from the aluminum piece. Fold the foil over so it covers the aluminum piece but is not sealed. The aluminum foil creates distortions as well as a rainbow pattern on the aluminum due to the heat and chemical reaction. Load your aluminum pieces in the dishwasher. Keep the open ends of the aluminum foil facing upwards so that the water can run down into the package. Stack your pieces in the dish rack of the washer. Fill the dispenser with powdered dishwashing detergent and TSP. Add powdered dishwashing detergent, like Cascade Complete or Finish Dishwasher Powder, to the dispenser. Then, add 1 teaspoon of trisodium phosphate (TSP) to the dispenser. TSP can be found at your local hardware or home improvement store. Run the pots and pans cycle. Age the aluminum by running the dishwasher on the pots and pans cycle. Turn on the drying cycle as well. Remove the pieces from the dishwasher. After the cycle is complete, carefully remove the aluminum pieces from the dishwasher. Use caution, as they may be hot. Remove the foil around the aluminum. Repeat the process to add more patina. If you want to add more patina or increase the aged look of the aluminum, wrap the pieces in aluminum foil at a different orientation and run them through the dishwashing cycle again. Using Cold Water and Oxygen Cleaner Sprinkle oxygen-based cleaner in the bottom of a container. Choose a container large enough for your aluminum pieces to fit inside and be completely submerged. Sprinkle a few tablespoons of an oxygen-based cleaner (like Oxi-Clean, Clorox Oxygen Action, All Oxi-Active, or Shout Oxy Powder) in the bottom of the container. You can make your own oxygen cleaner by combining 1 part sodium percarbonate (dry, powdered hydrogen peroxide) and 1 part sodium carbonate (washing soda or soda ash). Take care not to confuse either of those powders with sodium bicarbonate (baking soda). Place crumpled aluminum foil in the container to create patterns. If you\u2019d like your aluminum to have patterns in the aging, you can create them with aluminum foil. Crumple up several pieces of aluminum foil and place them in the bottom of the container, on top of the oxygen-based cleaner. Press them flat into the bottom of the container. Add a few more tablespoons of oxygen-based cleaner on top of the aluminum foil. Lay your aluminum pieces on top of the aluminum foil. You can put templates, gears, or other items on top of the aluminum that will prevent the covered sections from being aged, if you\u2019d like to make designs or shapes on your aluminum. Sprinkle more oxygen-based cleaner on top of the aluminum pieces. Several tablespoons should suffice. Spread the cleaner evenly over the metal and try to avoid building up piles of the powder on top of the aluminum. Place something heavy on top of the aluminum. In order to keep your aluminum pieces from floating in the water, place a heavy object on top of them. You can use another piece of metal like a weight or a gear, or even a wrapped stack of dinner plates. Pour cold water in the container. Pour cold water in the container until the entire piece of aluminum is submerged. Add up to \u00bd inch (1.3 cm) of water over the top of the aluminum to ensure it is completely covered.
