                    "description": "Some people believe tarot cards can uncover truths about the physical, mental, or spiritual state of someone or something. Use a guidebook, your deck\u2019s instruction manual, or consult a psychic to practice learning the cards and their various meanings. There are seventy-eight standard tarot card images divided into various subclasses (minor and major arcana). Each card is a symbol and represents a certain meaning situation. Familiarizing yourself with these cards and their associated meanings will make interpreting them easier later on. Carry a deck with you at all times -- on the bus, at school, and to doctor\u2019s appointments. Many cards have multiple meanings. Learn them all in order to give your reading context and depth."

                    "description": "Palm reading (palmistry) is a psychic skill which analyzes the hand to reveal individual personality and character traits. There are two varieties of palmistry: chiromancy and chirognomy. Chiromancy looks at the lines of the palm and is a more traditional palm reading technique. By analyzing major and minor lines of the hand, you might be able to discover things about someone\u2019s physical and emotional condition. Chirognomy uses the shape and texture of the hands and color of the skin in order to potentially draw out similar truths. By studying the hand\u2019s shape and classifying it into one of four categories -- earth, air, fire, or water -- you might be able to discern a person\u2019s characteristics."

Some people, for instance, believe that numbers in your birth date, or numbers which you encounter regularly like your address, indicate your purpose in life, motivation, and fate. Practicing numerology is an arcane psychic reading practice. Numerologists believe each number has a special cosmic vibration which, in combination with others, can reveal certain truths. For instance, a popular numerological analysis is the lifepath number. This number adds the day, month, and year together, then adds the individual digits in this number in order to arrive at the lifepath number. Each number (1-9) has a different meaning. For instance, if you were born on 04/27/1986, you\u2019d add 4 + 27 + 1986 to get 2017. Then, adding 2 + 0 + 1 + 7 you get 9, your lifepath number."

                    "description": "Lithomancy is a divination method which uses rocks and stones. Some people believe lithomancy can reveal someone\u2019s energy and offer omens about the future. Using smooth precious gemstones, cast the stones to interpret their meaning. You can either assign meaning, or use the rocks to interpret someone\u2019s fortune along the lines of the zodiac. If interpreting the rocks in a predetermined way, assign one rock as \u201cyes\u201d and one as \u201cno\u201d before answering a question. Drop both rocks in front of you using one hand. The rock which falls closer to you is the one which provides your answer. You could also drop three rocks, one for \u201cyes,\u201d one for \u201cno,\u201d and one to indicate which answer is correct. Drop all three rocks. If the indicator rock drops closest to the \u201cno\u201d rock, your answer is negative; if it drops closest to the \u201cyes\u201d rock, your answer is positive. If interpreting the rocks along the lines of the zodiac, you will need to use twelve stones, each unique so that it can be identified. A list of these so-called birthstones can be found at https://www.americangemsociety.org/birthstones. Place the stone which corresponds to your zodiac sign on the table or ground in front of you. Place the other stones in a small pouch or purse and close it tightly. Shake the stones up within the bag and drop one out. Practitioners believes that the stone which comes out indicates that someone born under that sign will soon cross your path in an important role. For instance, if you were born in February, you\u2019d place your birthstone (amethyst) on the table. If after shaking the bag of stones and dropping one out, you saw it was an emerald, you\u2019d know that someone born in May (the month which corresponds to the emerald birthstone) was going to cross your path soon as a lover, friend, or enemy. Natural stones like those found on beaches are best for lithomancy. If possible, procure natural stones."

        "There are seventy-eight standard tarot card images divided into various subclasses (minor and major arcana).",
        "Each card is a symbol and represents a certain meaning situation.",
        "Familiarizing yourself with these cards and their associated meanings will make interpreting them easier later on.",
        "Carry a deck with you at all times -- on the bus, at school, and to doctor\u2019s appointments.",
        "Many cards have multiple meanings.",
        "Learn them all in order to give your reading context and depth.",
        "Practice palm reading.",
        "Palm reading (palmistry) is a psychic skill which analyzes the hand to reveal individual personality and character traits.",
        "There are two varieties of palmistry: chiromancy and chirognomy.",
        "Chiromancy looks at the lines of the palm and is a more traditional palm reading technique.",
        "By analyzing major and minor lines of the hand, you might be able to discover things about someone\u2019s physical and emotional condition.",
        "Chirognomy uses the shape and texture of the hands and color of the skin in order to potentially draw out similar truths.",
        "By studying the hand\u2019s shape and classifying it into one of four categories -- earth, air, fire, or water -- you might be able to discern a person\u2019s characteristics.",
        "Practice numerology.",
        "Numerology is the study of numbers and, practitioners believe, their use in discovering their application to someone\u2019s life.",
        "Some people, for instance, believe that numbers in your birth date, or numbers which you encounter regularly like your address, indicate your purpose in life, motivation, and fate.",
        "Practicing numerology is an arcane psychic reading practice.",
        "Numerologists believe each number has a special cosmic vibration which, in combination with others, can reveal certain truths.",
        "For instance, a popular numerological analysis is the lifepath number.",
        "This number adds the day, month, and year together, then adds the individual digits in this number in order to arrive at the lifepath number.",
        "Each number (1-9) has a different meaning.",
        "For instance, if you were born on 04/27/1986, you\u2019d add 4 + 27 + 1986 to get 2017.",
        "Then, adding 2 + 0 + 1 + 7 you get 9, your lifepath number.",
        "Practice lithomancy.",
        "Lithomancy is a divination method which uses rocks and stones.",
        "Some people believe lithomancy can reveal someone\u2019s energy and offer omens about the future.",
        "Using smooth precious gemstones, cast the stones to interpret their meaning.",
        "You can either assign meaning, or use the rocks to interpret someone\u2019s fortune along the lines of the zodiac.",
        "If interpreting the rocks in a predetermined way, assign one rock as \u201cyes\u201d and one as \u201cno\u201d before answering a question.",
        "Drop both rocks in front of you using one hand.",
        "The rock which falls closer to you is the one which provides your answer.",
        "You could also drop three rocks, one for \u201cyes,\u201d one for \u201cno,\u201d and one to indicate which answer is correct.",
        "Drop all three rocks.",
        "If the indicator rock drops closest to the \u201cno\u201d rock, your answer is negative; if it drops closest to the \u201cyes\u201d rock, your answer is positive.",
        "If interpreting the rocks along the lines of the zodiac, you will need to use twelve stones, each unique so that it can be identified.",
        "A list of these so-called birthstones can be found at https://www.americangemsociety.org/birthstones.",
        "Place the stone which corresponds to your zodiac sign on the table or ground in front of you.",
        "Place the other stones in a small pouch or purse and close it tightly.",
        "Shake the stones up within the bag and drop one out.",
        "Practitioners believes that the stone which comes out indicates that someone born under that sign will soon cross your path in an important role.",
        "For instance, if you were born in February, you\u2019d place your birthstone (amethyst) on the table.",
        "If after shaking the bag of stones and dropping one out, you saw it was an emerald, you\u2019d know that someone born in May (the month which corresponds to the emerald birthstone) was going to cross your path soon as a lover, friend, or enemy.",
        "Natural stones like those found on beaches are best for lithomancy.",
        "If possible, procure natural stones.",
        "Gazing Into the Ball (Crystallomancy) Choose a good crystal ball.",
        "Purchase your ball from a legitimate psychic good dealer.",
        "If possible, examine each in person.",
        "A quality crystal ball will be made of natural quartz crystal, either clear or white in color.",
        "The correct ball should choose you as much as you choose it.",
        "You might get a feeling that the ball \u201cbelongs\u201d to you, or you might see your name reflected in the surface of the ball.",
        "A ball three inches in diameter is an ideal size.",
        "Do not buy a crystal ball from a pawn shop, flea market, or other used goods emporium.",
        "Such a ball may be imbued with negative energy, and may have been discarded for that reason.",
        "Sit quietly in a dimly lit room with the ball before you.",
        "Candle lighting works well and provides the right ambiance for a reading.",
        "The light source should be in front and ahead of the ball so that when you gaze into it, it is illuminated adequately.",
        "If you use electric light, try to use a dimmer so that you can adjust the luminosity.",
        "Draw the curtains if you're conducting a reading during the day.",
        "Pick the ball up with both hands.",
        "Cup it carefully in your hands and begin to rotate it slowly from right to left.",
        "Rotate the ball at the rate of only about one centimeter every eight seconds.",
        "Be careful not to drop the ball, as they tend to be fragile and can break easily.",
        "Always hold and move the crystal ball gently, as you would a small baby.",
        "Gaze into the ball.",
        "First, look at the patterns, refractions, and striations with your physical eyes.",
        "Continuing to turn the ball over, begin to gaze into the ball with your third eye, the one which perceives psychic energy.",
        "You may believe you're entering a trance state and receiving visions from the past, present, or future.",
        "The visions may pertain to you or a third party whose energy you perceive and use to guide your crystallomancy session.",
        "Picking Up Good Vibrations (Psychometry) Get comfortable.",
        "Take a few deep, cleansing breaths.",
        "Roll your shoulders backwards and forwards a few times, and roll your neck in a full circle twice clockwise and twice counterclockwise.",
        "Relax into a seated position with both feet on the ground and your hands palm-down on your thighs.",
        "Close your eyes.",
        "Have a partner bring you a series of unfamiliar objects.",
        "If you're just starting out, small metal objects work best.",
        "For more advanced practice, you might use unwashed clothing.",
        "Arrange the objects in front of you and focus on each one in sequence.",
        "Let your eye travel from one object to the next, staying conscious of the initial feelings or impressions you get from each.",
        "You may arrange them randomly, but you might sense before arranging them that they belong in a natural order, like pages in a book.",
        "Perhaps, for instance, you sense that they belong in a chronological order, with those which were used or produced earliest situated at left, while those which were used or produced later toward the right.",
        "Take an object in your hands.",
        "Turn it over and open your mind to the history it contains.",
        "With your eyes closed, allow the visions you see when you touch it to engulf your mind.",
        "If you seize on an image in your mind\u2019s eye, or hear a small voice in the back of your mind which you think may reveal details about its owner and their fate, let your partner know.",
        "Repeat with all objects.",
        "Try to identify the gender, age, and race of the owner.",
        "Report your impressions with accuracy and ask your partner for verification.",
        "Don't fret if you don't get any impressions.",
        "Not every object will inspire a vision.",
        "You might believe that psychometric visions are accurate when they intuitively \"feel\" right; remember, though, they are just random thoughts in your head and not indicative of any actual psychic ability.",
        "Listening to Your Intuition (Clairvoyance) Be aware of your surroundings.",
        "Reach out with your five senses.",
        "Psychic ability is a sixth sense which can best be harnessed when your five traditional senses are operating at optimal capacity.",
        "Your intuition or extrasensory perception (ESP) will operate best when you are actively listening, looking, and feeling the world around you.",
        "Slow your thinking down.",
        "Next time you\u2019re waiting in class or in the doctor\u2019s office, instead of being bored or impatient, try to relax.",
        "Slow your breathing and slowly block out everything except the person or object ahead of you.",
        "Focusing your attention this way will free you of distraction.",
        "Alternately, change your environment to one with few distractions.",
        "For instance, if you're in a noisy daycare center with many crying babies, you are not in a location where you can easily slow your thinking down.",
        "Try moving to your bedroom or another room where you can think clearly.",
        "Accept the diversity of forms in which a clairvoyant vision may arrive.",
        "You may experience a premonition, knowledge about a particular situation or event occurring now or in the future, contact with a god or goddess, or the ability to see a physical aura around certain individuals which indicates their mood or attitude.",
        "When you experience these phenomena, do not be afraid or worried.",
        "They are just different forms of the same universal psychic energy which makes a reading possible.",
        "Record any visions or hunches you feel throughout the day.",
        "Utilize these revelations to make positive decisions.",
        "Don't be alarmed by the sudden arrival of visions or dreams.",
        "Clairvoyant psychic energies can reveal the past, present, or future.",
        "Some of this information will be immediately intelligible, while some will require thoughtful interpretation.",
        "Honing Your Psychic Abilities Determine what gift you may have.",
        "While you might believe that it may be possible to learn any psychic talent, some people believe they have a predisposition towards one or another methods of psychic reading.",
        "If you\u2019ve had foreknowledge of certain facts or events (even those not related intimately to someone\u2019s life), you may believe you have claircognizance.",
        "If you\u2019ve had accurate visions of the future, some people might think you possess psychic energies which enable clairvoyance.",
        "If you hear voices or receive audible directions which you believe are from beyond this plane of existence, you might think you have clairaudience.",
        "While these abilities might manifest themselves in different ways, each could have roots in a common psychic energy which the living, the dead, and the spirit world share.",

        "Visions you believe to be psychic in nature might arrive when deep in meditation.",
        "Assume a comfortable position.",

        "Chant to tap into your psychic power.",
        "Chanting will clear your mind of confusion and discord, and could open it to the universal psychic energy.",
        "Chant your personal mantra.",
        "This is a short phrase you can use to focus your thoughts and energy.",
        "For instance, you might chant \"I am present in the moment.\"",
        "Chant out loud at first, but wind down towards a silent chant.",
        "Stop worrying.",
        "The fear and doubt which follow worry will cloud the mind and lead to confusion.",
        "Use mindfulness to stay in the moment rather than reflect on what might happen or what has already happened.",
        "When you focus on things you can control, you\u2019ll be able to break the cycle of anxiety and worry that can easily suck you in.",
        "Finally, if an issue or problem in your life is so big that you have to worry about and deal with it at some point, try to schedule a time in which to do so, rather than let it take up all your time.",
        "When you are confident in yourself and your abilities, you might be able to tap into the positive energy which fuels a successful and accurate psychic reading.",
        "Practice.",
        "Take time each day to commune with the world you believe to be spiritual in nature, the world of psychic energy.",
        "If you find it hard to develop one particular ability, try your hand at another.",
