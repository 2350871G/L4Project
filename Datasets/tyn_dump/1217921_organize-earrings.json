        "Cut the top and side off of an egg carton, then paint the carton your favorite color and let it dry.",
        "Fill each ear with a pair of earrings.",
        "You can use spray paint or acrylic paint for this.",
        "You can decorate the egg carton further with glitter glue, rhinestones, and ribbon.",
        "Making a Frame Earring Holder Get some mesh.",
        "This can be a sheet of plastic canvas, window screening, tulle, or even lace.",
        "Plastic canvas is a great choice, because it comes in all sorts of colors and is easy to work with; you can find it at an arts and crafts store.",
        "This holder will work best for hook earrings, but it can work for stud earrings as well.",
        "If you are using window screening, consider spray painting it a fun color first.",
        "Paint one side first, let it dry, then flip it over and paint the other side.",
        "For a rustic frame, try burlap instead.",
        "You can even add a silhouette or letter to it with some fabric paint and a stencil.",
        "Take apart a picture frame.",
        "Discard the glass panel and the backing, or save them for another project.",
        "Alternatively, you can also use a simple, wooden frame base from the craft store; it doesn't come with a glass panel or backing, so it'll be less work for you.",
        "Don't worry about the color of the frame; you can always paint it.",
        "Paint or decorate the frame, if desired.",
        "If the frame is the right design, but the wrong color, you can spray paint it to suit your taste.",
        "You can also decorate your frame with glitter, glitter glue, or colorful rhinestones.",
        "Let everything dry completely before continuing.",
        "Trim the mesh so that it is slightly larger than the opening in the frame.",
        "Turn your frame over so that the back is facing you, then lay the mesh down on it.",
        "Use painter's tape or masking tape to mark off where you need to cut the mesh.",
        "When you are done, cut the mesh using the tape as your guideline.",
        "Peel off any excess tape.",
        "Don't use marker.",
        "Not only will you mess the frame up, but the marker will be hard to see on the material.",
        "Glue the mesh down to the back of the frame, and let it dry.",
        "Draw a line of glue around the outer edges of the opening on the back of the frame.",
        "Quickly press the mesh into the glue.",
        "You can use hot glue or tacky glue for this.",
        "If you used tulle, lace, or burlap, you can use fabric glue instead.",
        "Different types of glue will take different amounts of time to dry.",
        "Tacky glue will take a few hours while hot glue will set almost immediately.",
        "If you'd like to hide the glue, outline the inside edges of the mesh square with glue, then cover it with strips of ribbon.",
        "Make sure that the ribbon does not stick past the opening of the frame.",
        "Lean the frame against your wall or dresser.",
        "Because you took the backing out, the frame won't be able to stand up on its own.",
        "You can't put the backing in again either, because it will \"block\" the mesh and prevent you from inserting your earrings.",
        "If you want to make your frame a little more stable, there are a few things you can do:\nCut a piece of ribbon and tie it into a loop.",
        "Glue it to the back of your frame, and use it to hang it up on the wall.",
        "Use a frame holder or frame stand to hold up your frame.",
        "Hot glue a short dowel or two to the back of the frame to make a stand.",
        "If you'd like, you can paint the dowel to match the frame.",
        "Hang your earrings onto the mesh.",
        "This earring holder is best for hook earrings, but it can work for stud earrings too.",
        "Simply take the earring backing off first, poke the earring through the mesh, then pop the backing back on.",
        "Making an Earring Box Paint a wooden box the color you want.",
        "The best wooden box to work with is something that is relatively shallow, between 1 to 3 inches (2.54 to cc centimeters) deep.",
        "It is best for stud earrings, but it can work for hook earrings too.",
        "You can use acrylic paint or spray paint for this.",
        "For something more girlish, paint the outside of the box with fine, scrapbooking glitter.",
        "Be sure to coat it with a glossy sealer afterwards to keep the glitter from shedding, however.",
        "Cut several strips of felt that are the same length as the inside of your box.",
        "If you plan on wrapping these strips around a pencil (for extra support) make them 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) wide.",
        "If you don't plan on doing that, make them 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 2032 centimeters) wide instead.",
        "Roll each piece of felt into a tight tube.",
        "If you'd like, you can roll the felt around a short dowel or pencil to make it sturdier.",
        "Make sure that the dowel or pencil is long enough to fit inside the box.",
        "Pack all of the felt tubes into the bottom of the box.",
        "To make this permanent, glue the felt rolls seam-side-down into the box.",
        "Make sure that all of the felt tubes are facing the same direction.",
        "If you can still see the bottom of the box, you will need to make more felt tubes.",
        "Consider covering the tubes with a scrap of fabric for a more finished look.",
        "Cut a piece of fabric the same width as the inside of your box, but a few inches/centimeters longer.",
        "Drape it over the top, then tuck the fabric in between the felt tubes.",
        "Tuck any excess fabric between the first/last tubes and the sides of the box.",
        "Set your earrings in between the felt tubes.",
        "This holder works best for stud earrings, but it can also work for hook earrings if you insert them sideways."
