        "Stir in 1 tablespoon (8 g) of grated ginger, 1/8 teaspoon (0.7 g) of salt, 1/8 teaspoon (0.3 g) of ground black pepper, and 1 tablespoon (10 g) of chopped shallots.",
        "Place 1 pound (450 g) of grouper fillets in a baking dish or sheet.",
        "If you're baking the fish, get out an oven-safe dish that's large enough to hold the fillets and arrange the grouper in a single layer.",
        "To broil the grouper, get out a baking sheet and grease it before laying the fillets across it.",
        "Avoid using a broiler pan with slits or holes since it will be difficult to remove the fish from the pan.",
        "Spray the sheet with cooking spray or brush it with a little vegetable oil.",
        "Spread the lemon butter mixture over the grouper.",
        "Carefully turn each fillet over so they're coated on both sides with the lemon butter mixture.",
        "It's fine if some of the mixture pools around the sides of the fillets.",
        "Bake or broil the fish for 5 to 7 minutes.",
        "Put the baking dish in the center of the preheated oven or place the baking sheet below the preheated broiler.",
        "Cook or broil the fish until it's opaque and flaky when you drag a fork across the center.",
        "If the fish is more than 1 in (2.5 cm) thick, it may need to cook for 1 to 2 more minutes.",
        "Serve the baked or broiled grouper.",
        "Turn off the oven or broiler and remove the grouper.",
        "If there's any lemon butter sauce around the fish, spoon it over the fillets and serve the fish fillets while they're hot.",
        "Refrigerate leftover grouper in an airtight container for up to 3 or 4 days."
