        "Hold the syringe needle-up and flick the side of the syringe to cause any bubbles to float to the top.",
        "When you've dislodged all the bubbles in the syringe, gently depress the plunger until all the air leaves the syringe.",
        "You can stop when you see a tiny drop of liquid emerge from the tip of the needle.",
        "Check to make sure there\u2019s enough medicine left for a full dose after aspiration.",
        "It\u2019s easy to expel too much medication, especially with a small injection like an insulin shot.",
        "If you have to, go back and add a little more, then repeat the process.",
        "The tiny amount of air that can get trapped in a syringe is not large enough to cause serious harm if it is injected into the patient\u2019s body by accident.",
        "A trapped bubble injected under the skin could cause bruising, however.",
        "Giving the Shot Sterilize the injection site.",
        "Wipe your chosen injection site with a cotton ball soaked in alcohol or with a sterile, pre-packaged alcohol wipe.",
        "Alcohol kills germs and microorganisms on the skin, reducing the risk that the needle will carry them under the skin.",
        "Hold the syringe with one hand.",
        "Use your other hand to pinch your flesh where the shot will be given.",
        "This causes a \"bulge\" in the fatty tissue, which gives you a thicker area to safely inject into.",
        "Stick the needle into the skin at a 45\u00b0 angle.",
        "Hold the needle like a dart and plunge the needle into the spot you've pinched.",
        "Don\u2019t worry about rushing the process, just deliver the injection at a speed you feel comfortable with.",
        "You can also insert the needle in a 90\u00b0 position, or a right angle.",
        "If your patient does not have a lot of body fat, make sure to gently pinch the skin and hold it away from the muscle before delivering the shot.",
        "Administer the drug.",
        "Release the drug into the subcutaneous layer by slowly pushing down on the plunger.",
        "Push at a steady, controlled pace.",
        "Some minor discomfort is normal at this point.",
        "To get the timing right, try counting to 3.",
        "Start injecting on 1, then count out 2 and 3 as you push in the plunger the rest of the way.",
        "Remove the needle from the patient\u2019s skin and discard it.",
        "Gently but confidently pull the needle out of the patient\u2019s skin.",
        "Before doing anything else, dispose of the needle in a labeled sharps container.",
        "Don\u2019t recap the needle before throwing it away.",
        "Once you\u2019ve delivered the injection, the needle is dirty and is considered a biohazard.",
        "Handle the used needle carefully, since this is the part of the process where most accidental needle sticks occur.",
        "After you remove the needle and throw it away, apply gentle pressure to the injection site with a clean cotton ball.",
        "Bandage the injection site.",
        "Apply a dry cotton ball to the injection wound.",
        "If desired, you may use a bandage to hold this against the wound, or you may hold it in place yourself, taking care not to touch the wound, and discard it when bleeding stops.",
        "Dispose of the cotton balls, needle and syringe appropriately in a sharps bin.",
        "Place any contaminated material in a sturdy, clearly-marked container.",
        "Clean your work area and put away your tools.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a specially marked \u201csharps bin\u201d or a sharps disposal program in your area, you can safely dispose of your used needles in sturdy container with a lid, such as a milk jug or detergent bottle.",
        "Tape the lid on before placing the container in your garbage.",
        "In many areas, you can dispose of your sharps bin at a pharmacy."
