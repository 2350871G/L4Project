                    "description": "Since black soap is usually sold in a large block, you can prolong the life of your soap by using a sharp knife to slice it into bars. That way, you can keep what you\u2019re not using in a sealed container in the refrigerator, and just keep what you need in a smaller container near your sink or shower. Having smaller bars of soap is also easier to work with, especially when your hands are wet."

                    "description": "Since black soap contains vegetable matter that can be rough against your skin, it\u2019s best to work with just a little at a time. This helps prevent irritation due to larger pieces of tree bark or pulp that didn\u2019t get broken down all the way. In addition, some people experience a burning or stinging sensation when they apply black soap directly to their skin. Lathering up a small amount first can help prevent this from happening."

The lauric acid creates a natural, foamy lather when you rub the soap between your wet hands. You only want to create enough lather to create a light layer on your skin. Too much lather can be drying. If you like, you can use a washcloth or a loofah to lather up the soap."

The black soap will gently cleanse and exfoliate your skin. Black soap is often used to treat acne, soothe rosacea, lighten dark spots, and heal rashes. Since black soap can be drying, it\u2019s best to use it about 2-3 times a week. Use a gentle moisturizing cleanser formulated for your skin type on the other days."

If you\u2019re washing your face with the black soap, use a moisturizer specifically designed for use on your face.

For instance, rosemary oil is thought to stimulate hair growth and increase circulation. Lavender essential oil helps keep your hair shiny and controls dandruff. Peppermint oil helps to promote hair growth. Avoid using citrus essential oils in your hair, as they can increase your skin's sensitivity to the sun.

        "Every 20 minutes or so, stir the soap with a spoon or a wooden stick to help speed up the melting process.",
        "If you notice that the water is completely cooled and the soap has not melted, place the mixture in the microwave for about 30 seconds and stir it again.",
        "Stir in 1.5 tablespoons (22 mL) each of 2-3 of your favorite oils.",
        "Black soap can be drying on its own, so it\u2019s best to add natural, nourishing oils to the shampoo so leave your hair super-soft.",
        "Once the soap and water mixture has cooled, add in oils like jojoba, coconut, olive, or argan oils.",
        "Other oils you could use include shea butter, grapeseed oil vitamin E, or neem oil.",
        "If you use coconut oil or shea butter, just scoop out the amount you need and microwave it to melt the oil before add it to your base.",
        "This shampoo is endlessly customizable.",
        "If you\u2019re not sure which oils you want to use, try reducing the recipe and make several small portions with different combinations to see what you like the best.",
        "Add about 10 drops each of 1-3 of your favorite essential oils if you\u2019d like.",
        "If you want your shampoo to be scented, you can add essential oils like rosemary, chamomile, lavender, tea tree, or peppermint to your shampoo.",
        "Just measure about 10 drops of each into the shampoo mixture and stir them in.",
        "In addition to smelling amazing, many essential oils can help improve the health of your hair.",
        "For instance, rosemary oil is thought to stimulate hair growth and increase circulation.",
        "Lavender essential oil helps keep your hair shiny and controls dandruff.",
        "Peppermint oil helps to promote hair growth.",
        "Avoid using citrus essential oils in your hair, as they can increase your skin's sensitivity to the sun.",
        "This can lead to a nasty sunburn on your scalp if you spend time outdoors.",
        "Transfer the mixture to a dispenser bottle if you want.",
        "Once your shampoo mixture is finished, you may want to add it into a squeeze bottle so you can easily apply it to your hair.",
        "You can use an old shampoo bottle or a bottle with a pointed tip, such as a condiment dispenser, to make it easier to apply the shampoo directly to your roots.",
        "If you used shea butter or coconut oil, you may need to microwave your shampoo to thin it out before you use it.",
        "African black soap doesn't expire, but some essential oils do have a shelf life, which may affect the life of your shampoo.",
        "Wash your hair as usual with the African black soap shampoo.",
        "Wet your hair, then apply the shampoo to your roots and massage it in.",
        "Black soap shampoo will lather, but it might not lather as much as commercial shampoos that you\u2019re used to.",
        "Since some settling can occur, you might want to shake or stir the shampoo before you use it.",
        "This shampoo is very effective at removing dirt and oils from your scalp.",
        "As with most clarifying shampoos, it's best to limit its use to every 2-3 washes.",
        "Rinse your hair with cool water or apple cider vinegar.",
        "Just as with regular shampoo, you\u2019ll need to rinse your hair thoroughly after you wash it.",
        "Using cool water to rinse your hair will help close the cuticle, sealing in moisture and leaving your hair looking shiny and smooth.",
        "Since African black soap can be alkaline, you may want to rinse your hair with diluted apple cider vinegar to help balance out your hair\u2019s pH before you condition it.",
        "However, if you don\u2019t have apple cider vinegar, or you don\u2019t like using it, this isn\u2019t necessary.",
        "Condition your hair with your regular conditioner.",
        "Thanks to all of the oils added in your African black soap shampoo, your hair will be nourished and moisturized.",
        "However, the shampoo does have a tendency to leave your hair tangled.",
        "To counteract this, condition your hair after you wash it with your favorite conditioner.",
        "Almost all commercial conditioners contain detanglers."
