They aren't taking up enough space to make much of a difference. If your walls are really long or your ceilings are really tall, enlist a friend to hold one end of the measuring tape in place. If you\u2019re going to paint the ceiling, grab a ladder. Place it near a corner and climb the ladder carefully before extending your measuring tape.

For example, if a 1 gallon (3.8 L) can reads that it covers 350 square feet (33 m), and your wall is 10,000 square feet (930 m), divide 10,000 square feet (930 m) by 350 square feet (33 m) to determine how many gallons (or liters) you need."

        "Buying Your Paint Read the labels on cans of paint carefully to see how much they cover.",
        "Many cans of paint list the number of square feet or meters that they cover on the label.",
        "This is mainly because certain styles of paint cover walls differently.",
        "If the paint can lists the number of square feet or meters that it covers, use that measurement to determine how many cans to buy instead of estimating.Tip: In terms of different types of paint, 1 gallon (3.8 L) of oil-based paint may cover 300 square feet (28 m), while the same amount of acrylic paint may cover 400 square feet (37 m).",
        "For example, if a 1 gallon (3.8 L) can reads that it covers 350 square feet (33 m), and your wall is 10,000 square feet (930 m), divide 10,000 square feet (930 m) by 350 square feet (33 m) to determine how many gallons (or liters) you need.",
        "Get roughly 1 US gal (3.8 L) for every 400 sq ft (37 m) if your walls are smooth.",
        "If you have a new or refurbished home with smooth walls, your paint won\u2019t have a hard time covering your drywall.",
        "Buy approximately 1 gallon (3.8 L) of paint for every 400 square feet (37 m) that you\u2019re going to paint.",
        "This is a rough estimate.",
        "The texture of your walls, brand of paint, and the temperature of your room will all change the amount of paint you need to cover a wall.",
        "For example, if your sum total is 4,265 square feet (396.2 m) and your walls are even, divide 4,265 square feet (396.2 m) by 400 square feet (37 m) to get 10.66 gallons (40.4 L).",
        "Always round up when you have a decimal or fraction at the end of your measurement for the paint.",
        "If you need more than 4 gallons (15 L), buy in 5 US gal (19 L) increments.",
        "Paint suppliers typically offer a discount for buying 5 US gal (19 L) containers instead of smaller 1 gallon (3.8 L) cans.",
        "Buy approximately 1 US gal (3.8 L) for every 250 sq ft (23 m) if your walls are rough.",
        "If you\u2019re painting exposed brick, stucco, or older drywall, your paint is going to have a rougher time soaking into the texture of your walls.",
        "Buy roughly 1 gallon (3.8 L) for every 250 square feet (23 m) to play it safe.",
        "For example, if your sum total is 4,265 square feet (396.2 m) and your walls are kind of old, divide 4,265 square feet (396.2 m) by 250 square feet (23 m) to get 17.06 gallons (64.6 L).",
        "Get twice as much paint if you\u2019re covering a color or adding 2 coats.",
        "If you\u2019re going to be painting some red or green walls white, you\u2019re going to need a lot more paint to cover your walls.",
        "If you plan on painting multiple coats, double the square footage that you calculated and use that as your final measurement when it comes to figuring out how much paint you need to buy."
