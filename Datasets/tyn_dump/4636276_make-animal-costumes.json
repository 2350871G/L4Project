    "text": " Making a Lion Costume Find an old hoodie that you don\u2019t use anymore or buy one at a thrift store. The best colors are yellow, tan, gold and orange, but you can be any color lion you want to be. To go a step further, get a yellow or gold hoodie with matching pants. Buy a skein of yellow or gold yarn for your mane.  Purchase some matching yellow or gold fabric or felt. You need one-fourth of a yard. Cut a small strip of yellow fabric that is the circumference of your hood. Lay it out on your worktable. Begin looping your yarn back and forth across the width of your fabric. Pin the loops onto the fabric every few inches so that they stay put. Insert the end of the fabric and sew vertically along the center of the long piece of fabric and across the yarn loops. It is easier if you sew as you go along and continue looping the yarn back and forth a few inches at a time. Try to use as much yarn as possible to create a very bushy mane. Continue until you reach the bottom of the thin piece of fabric. Backstitch so that your yarn is secure. Cut through each of the loops to make the fringe. If your mane isn\u2019t full enough, you can repeat the process with another layer of yarn loops. Fold the piece of fabric up from the back and pin it around the inner edge of your hood. Sew it on with the sewing machine. Cut out four three inch square pieces of fabric. Sew two pieces together, leaving the bottom open. Curve the top corners slightly to make lion ears. Repeat with the other set. Stuff the ears with batting, extra fabric or cotton balls.  Hand sew the bottom of the ears to the left and right sides of your hood. Try to bury them between layers of yarn fringe. They should be on either side of your forehead. Add accessories, like furry socks or slippers and a tail.  Making a Bee Costume Purchase a roll of yellow duct tape.  Find a black shirt and pants or a black dress that you don\u2019t wear anymore.  Cut lengths of duct tape that are the approximate circumference of your body and wrap them horizontally around your body. Stripe your body every three inches. Grab some black nylons and two clothes hangers to make your wings. Use pliers to unwrap the metal coat hangers. Fashion them into ovals and connect them with twist ties or by wrapping the metal in the middle. Connect two looped pieces of elastic to the center of the coat hangers. These are the straps that you will loop your arms into. Stretch a leg of the black panty hose around each side of the clothes hanger frame. Then, fold the middle section around the center and tie it. Buy two yellow pipe cleaners and two yellow pompoms. Glue them to a black headband on either side of your head with super glue. Twist them to look like antennae. Making a Frog Costume Buy some bright green felt at the craft store. Cut 13 three to four inch triangles out of the felt. Be careful to make them the same exact size. Pin the corners together to make a large bunting. The top point of the triangles will be facing down. Thread your sewing machine with green thread. Then, sew through the top of the bunting, making sure to sew through the points where the triangles overlap. Wear a green shirt and pants if you have them. Loop the bunting around your neck. Pin it together where it meets. Grab two small white felt balls or white Styrofoam balls. Draw eyeballs in the center with black permanent marker. If you want to emulate Kermit the frog, search for an image on a search engine and draw the eyes in a similar manner. Glue the eyes to small alligator clips. Use super glue to ensure that they stay on. Make sure the black pupils are facing the right way when the clips are horizontal. Clip the clips into your hair or onto a hat when they are dry. ",
