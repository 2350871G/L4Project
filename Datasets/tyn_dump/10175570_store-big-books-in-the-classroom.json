Spacious organizers, wrapping paper containers, and square laundry hampers can all make excellent places to stash large picture and activity books. If possible, narrow down your search to containers that have lids. A lid will keep your books from spilling out everywhere if the bin happens to get knocked over. Measure the height and width of your big books before you start shopping around for containers so you\u2019ll have an idea of what size you need.

An average-sized basket could hold as many as 2-3 dozen big books, depending on their exact dimensions! Rectangular baskets will provide a better fit for your books than round ones. As an added bonus, the built-in handles on laundry baskets make it easier to tote your collection of big books around with you.
