        "Letting each coat dry slightly before applying the next will help them better seal and adhere to one another.",
        "Add 2 more coats, waiting 15 minutes between each.",
        "You should have a total of three coats applied to your tub before you\u2019re done, though each coat does not need to be completely dry before applying the next one.",
        "Waiting 15 minutes should make the previous coat tacky enough to adhere to the next.",
        "Apply each coat in the same, smooth, left to right fashion whether painting or spraying.",
        "Make sure you cover the entire tub with each coat.",
        "Give the tub at least a day to dry.",
        "Don\u2019t run any water through the tub or attempt to touch the new finish for at least one full day.",
        "Keep the doors and windows open with the fan running if possible to keep the area ventilated and aid in the drying process.",
        "Don\u2019t let anyone use the toilet in the bathroom while it dries as the fumes can still be dangerous.",
        "Remove the tape and plastic.",
        "With the tub mostly dry, you can now remove all of the plastic, tape and paper you used to protect the walls and hardware in your tub.",
        "The finish should not be affected by you removing the tape, but with some finishes, it still may not be ready for use.",
        "Read the instructions on the bathtub finish you purchased to know how long it needs to cure completely before you use the bathtub again.",
        "Recaulk the seams you removed the caulk from before.",
        "It\u2019s best to use a non-silicone caulk that has anti-mildew properties.",
        "Silicone does not adhere well to bathtub finishes.",
        "Apply the caulk by squeezing the tube in an even bead along all of the seams that you removed the caulk from earlier.",
        "Use your finger to press the bead of caulk into the crack and create a smooth finish by running it over the caulk from one end to the other.",
        "Be sure to give the caulk enough time to completely dry before using the bathtub as well.",
        "Drying time will vary based on the type you use, so read the instructions included carefully."
