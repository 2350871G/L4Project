They come in sizes 1-12, and the size you'll need will depend on the size of your hook. The needle needs to be small enough to fit through the loops and the hook and eye, but not so small that it bends when you pass it through the fabric. The thread won\u2019t be visible in your finished project, but the hook and eye will look nicer if you use thread that matches\u2014or at least coordinates with\u2014your fabric.

        "Make sure the stitches are very close together.",
        "You can also use buttonhole stitches, if you\u2019d like.",
        "Sew a few loops down each side of the eye, below the curve.",
        "To stabilize the eye, add a couple of stitches on either side of the eye itself.",
        "Regular stitches are fine here, too.",
        "You don\u2019t want to sew too much here, since you still want to be able to lift the eye enough for the hook to slide through.",
        "Just 2-3 stitches on either side should be enough.",
        "Cut off any excess thread.",
        "When you\u2019re finished, tie a secure knot in the thread, then use scissors to cut away any excess.",
        "Try to cut as close to your knot as possible so you don\u2019t have dangling threads.",
        "You may want to attach the hook and eye at this point to make sure the closure is lined up correctly, and to ensure the fabric doesn\u2019t pull or pucker at the fastener."
