Make sure the ladder is at a safe angle by standing with your toes against the feet of the ladder on the ground and stretching your arms out in front of you, towards the ladder. Your fingertips should be able to touch the rungs of the ladder easily. You should also ensure that the ladder always hits your hip area or midsection when you are on it so you have enough balance and support to stand on it safely. If you do not own a ladder, you can borrow one from a friend or rent one at your local hardware store."

Chances are the high windows have not been cleaned in awhile, so they will likely have dust, dirt, and debris on the the frames that needs to be removed. Make sure the ladder is at a safe angle by standing with your toes against the feet of the ladder on the ground and stretching your arms out in front of you, towards the ladder. Your fingertips should be able to touch the rungs of the ladder easily. You should also ensure that the ladder always hits your hip area or midsection when you are on it so you have enough balance and support to stand on it safely. If you do not own a ladder, you can borrow one from a friend or rent one at your local hardware store. Wipe the windows down with a handheld vacuum or a wet cloth. The vacuum will be useful for animal droppings, spider webs, and thick dust. A wet cloth may be enough if there is just a light layer of dust or dirt on the windows. Never lean out of a high window from the inside to clean the windows. This can put you at risk of falling out of the window. You should also be on the outside of the windows on a stable ladder when you clean them. Washing the Windows Get an extendable pole with an attachment head.
