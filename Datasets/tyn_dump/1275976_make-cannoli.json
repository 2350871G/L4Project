Note: Prior to mixing the ingredients together, cut the shortening up into pea-size pieces to allow for easy mixing. Slowly stir in the eggs, vinegar, and water into the flour blended mix.  Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Knead for about 5 minutes. Cover the dough and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. It should feel chilled before working with it again. Roll out the dough onto a lightly floured surface with a rolling pin. Roll until it is about 1/8 inch (3mm) thick. Cut the dough into 5 inch (12.5cm) circles. Note: See the \"Tips\" section below to learn how to get perfect cannoli shells every time! Roll the pieces loosely around the cannoli tube until each piece slightly overlaps the opposite edge. Press the overlapping edges together and seal by dabbing them with a drop or two of water to ensure that they stick and do not break apart in the fryer. Heat the oil in deep fryer to 360\u2070 F/182\u00baC. Place the cannoli tube and shell in the deep fryer until golden brown. Remove each cannoli shell and tube from the deep fryer. Set the rolls on paper towel to cool. Remove the cannoli tube after it has cooled slightly. For the best results and the least breakage, do not wait until shells are cooled completely before removing them. Repeat until all dough is used.  Cream Filling Mix the cornstarch and sugar together in a medium mixing bowl.  Heat the half and half in top of double boiler over direct heat, and stir in the sugar and cornstarch gradually. Place over simmering water in double boiler, add the cinnamon stick, if desired, and cook until thickened. Remove from the heat. Cool completely in the refrigerator. Mix mini chocolate chips into cream filling once completely cooled (optional).  Cover the cream filling with plastic wrap tightly and refrigerate until ready to serve. When ready to serve, remove the cinnamon stick and stir well. Fill the cannoli shells with the cream filling using a pastry bag. For best results, fill one end of the cannoli at a time. Fill shell until cream filling slightly overfills its outer edges. Finishing Touches Top the cannolis with a light dusting of powdered sugar.  Garnish outer edges of cannolis with extra chocolate chips, chopped nuts, or maraschino cherries. Be creative- the possibilities are endless!",
