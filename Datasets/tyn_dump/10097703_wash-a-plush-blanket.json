Allow the soap to soak in for 10 minutes, then blot it gently with a wet paper towel to remove as much of the stain as possible. To lift away greasy or oily residue, try sprinkling a small amount of corn starch onto the stain and letting it sit for 5-10 minutes. It will absorb the oils in the stain, after which you can simply wipe it off. Avoid scrubbing at stains too forcefully. Doing so could just end up spreading them around and making them worse."
