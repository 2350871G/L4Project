                    "description": "Hair is made of protein, so it only makes sense that you'll need to include it in your diet if you want your beard to grow quickly. Opt for lean sources like turkey, fish, chicken, and tofu so you don't add a lot of saturated fat to your diet. Also, include plenty of fruits and veggies, as well as healthy fats from sources like avocadoes, olive oil, and nuts. B-complex vitamins, along with vitamins A, E, and D are also important for hair growth. However, you'll likely get enough of these vitamins as long as you're eating a well-balanced diet that includes foods like leafy greens, carrots, legumes, sweet potatoes, and tomatoes."

Because of that, taking 2.5\u20145 mg of a biotin supplement each day may help your beard grow in stronger and fuller. It's a good idea to talk to your doctor before you begin taking any supplements. They'll recommend the right dosage for you. Sometimes a biotin supplement can cause dry skin, which may in turn lead to breakouts.

For instance, you might try meditation, where you sit quietly for 5-10 minutes and try to clear your mind of any thoughts that arise.

A weekly hot oil treatment can also make your beard look soft and smooth. Tip: Sometimes when your beard is just growing in, your skin might be particularly itchy.
