        "If you can only afford one or two fitness related activities, such as a sports team and the gym or the gym and a hiking trip, you should determine what you want to spend your money on.",
        "If the gym is not on your current list of fitness priorities, you should cancel it.",
        "Determine whether the gym is affordable.",
        "If you need to cut down on your monthly bills, you may want to cancel your membership.",
        "You can always pursue less costly endeavors such as running or taking daily walks.",
        "Consider the cancellation fees.",
        "Since Crunch fitness requires you to stay for at least a year before cancelling, you should make sure you have been there for a year.",
        "If you haven\u2019t, you may have to pay a fee of $25 plus a fee of $175.",
        "So, if the amount you will save by cancelling early is less than $200, you may as well stick it out until the year is up and then cancel your membership at that time."
