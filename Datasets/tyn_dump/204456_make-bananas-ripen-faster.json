Some other fruits also release ethylene, ripening nearby fruits. The best options are apples, pears, apricots and similar pit fruits, avocados, kiwi, and quince. Other bananas will help as well, but the effect is low unless they're already ripe. Use the ripest fruit you can find, or cut the fruit to encourage more ethylene production. Even other fruits, leafy vegetables, and tubers sometimes produce ethylene if they are severely wounded. If you have no other options, cut them many times and add them to the bag."
