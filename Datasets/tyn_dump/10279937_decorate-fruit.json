These fruits will be used for filling the middle of your centerpiece and framing the outskirts of the plate. The best fruits to select for the outskirts of your plate are ones that are vibrant in color and can be easily sliced into small pieces, such as kiwifruit and strawberries. Rounded fruits such as grapes are ideal for filling the middle of the centerpiece since they create a complementary sense of dimension."
