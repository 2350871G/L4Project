        "Attach your keys to the keyring, or give the keyring away as a gift!",
        "Once you're done with the knotting and trimming, your keychain is ready to use.",
        "Wrap it up to give it to a friend, or add your keys and start using it yourself.",
        "Save your beads and other materials so you can make other crafts with them in the future.",
        "Making a Lizard Keychain Measure out and cut off 4 ft (1.2 m) of cord or ribbon.",
        "Almost any kind of lanyard or cord will work for this craft, but choose a strong material that won\u2019t break easily, like thin sewing thread.",
        "Feel free to pick a fun color of cord, like orange or yellow or green!",
        "The ribbon or cord needs to be able to fit through each bead twice, as that is how the lizard will be shaped.",
        "Choose 3 different colors of pony beads to use to create your lizard.",
        "Pick 27 beads of one color (the \u201cregular\u201d beads), and 21 beads of another color (the \u201ccolored\u201d beads).",
        "Finally, pick 2 beads of another color to be the lizard\u2019s eyes (black, silver, or gold are nice choices for the eyes).",
        "Green beads would be more realistic for a lizard, but don\u2019t be afraid to choose other colors, like yellow and red or pink and blue.",
        "You can buy pony beads in bulk from the craft store really inexpensively.",
        "Create the head of the lizard to start your keychain.",
        "Place 3 beads in the middle of the cord so that the length of cord on each side of them is equal.",
        "Then take the cord on the left side and thread it through the 2 rightmost beads (leaving the leftmost bead alone).",
        "Next, thread an eye bead, a regular bead, and another eye bead onto the right-side cord, and pull the left-side cord through those beads to create the eyes.",
        "Then add 2 regular beads to the right cord and thread the left cord through them the same way to create the neck of the lizard.",
        "Tightly pull the cord after each row to keep the beads in place.",
        "The head will be made up of the regular beads, plus the 2 eye beads, but none of the colored beads.",
        "Make the lizard\u2019s legs by threading beads on each side of the cord.",
        "Each leg is made up of 5 beads\u20142 regular beads, and 3 colored beads.",
        "Thread the 2 beads followed by the 3 colored beads onto one side of the cord, then thread the end of that same cord back through the first 2 beads.",
        "Pull the cord tight to create the leg.",
        "Repeat this on the other side of the lizard.",
        "The leg-making process does not require the left-side and right-side cords to intersect.",
        "The 3 colored beads are what make the actual foot of the lizard, while the 2 regular beads are the leg of the lizard.",
        "Form the body of the lizard with 8 regular and 6 colored beads.",
        "Create 4 rows for the body using the same method you used to create the head.",
        "Make the first row out of 2 regular beads and 1 colored bead, the second and third rows from 2 regular beads and 2 colored beads each, and the fourth row from 2 regular beads and 1 colored bead.",
        "After threading each row of beads onto the cord on the right side, pull the end of the cord on the left side back through the beads, pulling it tight to form the rows of the body.",
        "If you have more beads, you can make the lizard as big as you\u2019d like.",
        "Simply add more rows of beads, or make each row wider to increase the size of the lizard.",
        "Repeat the leg-forming process to create the bottom 2 lizard legs.",
        "Use 2 regular beads and 3 colored beads on each side.",
        "Thread the regular beads on first, followed by the colored beads, and then bring the end of the that same cord back through the regular beads.",
        "Pull the cord tight to form the feet.",
        "You could always make the bottom feet a different color from the top feet if you have enough beads.",
        "Use your creativity to make a unique lizard!",
        "Shape the long tail with the remainder of your beads.",
        "After the bottom legs are made, create a 2-bead row followed by 6 to 8 single-bead rows.",
        "Use an alternating color pattern for a neat visual effect, threading each bead onto the right-side cord.",
        "Remember to thread the end of the left-side cord through each bead to secure it in place, and pull the cord tight.",
        "Make the tail of the lizard as long or as short as you like.",
        "Attach the keyring to the end of the cord and make a knot.",
        "Place the keyring between the 2 ends of cord and position it right below the end of the lizard\u2019s tail.",
        "Tie a knot around the keyring to hold it securely in place.",
        "Trim away any excess cord.",
        "Use a glue gun to add a dot of hot glue to your knot for extra security if you\u2019d like."
