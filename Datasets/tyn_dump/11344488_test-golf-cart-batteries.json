If it still doesn\u2019t work, you need to replace the battery. Almost every golf cart uses multiple smaller batteries to achieve a total power of 36 or 48 volts. You probably have a series of 4 volt, 8 volt, or 12 volt batteries that combine to reach 36-48 volts. Test each battery separately. If your voltage is over the listed voltage on the battery, it\u2019s a sign that your battery is fully charged."

        "You won\u2019t get a reading doing it that way.",
        "Attach or connect the voltmeter\u2019s black probe to the  black terminal.",
        "The same way that you connected or held the red probe to the positive terminal, connect the black probe to the black terminal.",
        "Either hold it in place or clamp it on to the screw.",
        "If you\u2019re holding the probes in place, try to keep your hands as still as possible so that you can get an accurate reading.",
        "Compare the voltage reading on the screen to the battery\u2019s listed voltage.",
        "Once you get a stable reading, take the probes off of the battery and read the top or side of your battery to find the listed voltage.",

        "A load tester assesses how the voltage in a battery is effected when there\u2019s a lot of current running through the battery.",
        "It\u2019s possible that your golf cart battery\u2019s voltage is fine when it\u2019s not being used but has a ton of resistance or struggles to handle high currents, causing the battery to die.Warning: Load testing a battery is actually kind of dangerous.",
        "The high level of current will generate a lot of heat in the load tester and battery.",
        "Only test a battery on a concrete or heat-resistant surface that won\u2019t burn.",
        "An easy way to understand the difference between voltage and amperage is to think about a water pipe.",
        "Voltage is like the water pressure in a pipe, and current is how fast the water comes out.",
        "It doesn\u2019t matter if the pressure is good if the hole is too small to let water out!",
        "Connect the red clamp to the red terminal.",
        "Load testers have clamps at the end of each cable to tighten around the terminals on the battery.",
        "Start with the red terminal.",
        "Flip up any protective covers if necessary and find the terminal\u2019s lead screw.",

        "Hit the battery with 300-350 amps to see the voltage.",
        "The amount of amperage that you hit the battery with is always half of the battery\u2019s cold-crank amperage (CCA).",
        "This is listed on the battery itself, but it\u2019s almost always between 600-700 for a golf cart battery, so you\u2019re safe to hit the battery with 300 amps if you can\u2019t find the CCA.",
        "Turn the switch on for the load tester on and turn the dial to the necessary amperage.",
        "CCA refers to the battery\u2019s maximum power output when it\u2019s 0 \u00b0F (\u221218 \u00b0C) outside.",
        "It\u2019s a universal measurement for calculating the power of a battery.",
        "Check to see if voltage is close to your original voltmeter reading.",
        "A drop between 1-2 volts is to be expected when performing a load test.",
        "If the voltage drops more than 3-4 volts though, it\u2019s a sign that the battery is capable of achieving the necessary voltage but won\u2019t maintain that voltage when a current is passing through it.",
        "If this is the case, replace your battery.",
        "For example, if you tested your battery with the voltmeter and got a reading of 11.9 volts, and your load tester gives you a reading of 11.1 volts, your battery has adequate amperage.",
        "If it drops below 8 through, it\u2019s a sign that your battery is struggling to function properly.",
        "Turn the load tester off as soon as you get your reading to be safe.",
        "Load testing produces a ton of heat and the battery and load tester will both reach extremely hot temperatures if you just leave it on for too long.",
        "In order to play it safe, turn your load tester off as soon as you get a stable reading.",
        "If you want to test it again, you can always do a second load testing after the battery cools down a little.",
        "Checking Charge with a Hydrometer Take the removable caps off the top of the battery.",
        "The top of your battery will have 2-4 plastic caps on the top.",
        "These are the covers for the individual cells that generate electricity.",
        "Inside, there are separate cells filled with water that cover a plate, which uses the electrolytes in the water as a conduit.",
        "Pop the top off of each cell and get a hydrometer that will fit in the opening for each cell.Tip: There are special hydrometers designed for testing water in batteries.",
        "Most of these are for car batteries though, so ignore the green, red, and white markers indicating whether a water\u2019s levels are safe or not.",
        "Wear protective eyewear and work in a well-ventilated area when performing this test.",
        "Wear long sleeves and gloves to keep dangerous liquids off of your skin.",
        "A hydrometer kind of looks like a turkey baster with a little measuring float in the middle of the tube.",
        "They\u2019re usually made out of glass, but there are rubber versions as well.",
        "In a golf cart battery, a hydrometer will measure the charge of the battery by measuring the weight of the water.",
        "You can tell if the charge is acceptable for the batteries if all of the cells have a similar reading.",
        "Inspect the plates inside each hole to see if they\u2019re covered in water.",
        "Check the water level to see if it\u2019s covering your battery\u2019s cell plates or not.",
        "The water in the battery should rest at least \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) above the plates inside of the battery.",
        "If you can\u2019t see any plates, that\u2019s a sign that the water is high enough.",
        "If they\u2019re completely dry or moistening out and the water is low, this is why your battery hasn\u2019t been functioning properly.",
        "Use a flashlight if you can\u2019t see inside the holes.",
        "If the water is low, you can pour some distilled water into the battery until the plate is barely covered.",
        "If the plate was drying out for a long time, it\u2019s probably a wasted effort though.",
        "The battery is likely dead or about to die.",
        "Put a hydrometer inside the first cap and squeeze the tip to pull some water.",
        "Carefully place the glass or rubber tube inside the opening of the first cell.",
        "Dip it into the water and squeeze the little rubber ball at the top of the tool to suck some water into the tube.",
        "Give the water a second to move the float inside of the tube.",
        "Do not remove the tube from the opening.",
        "You want to keep all of the water inside your battery and you\u2019re going to squeeze it back out as soon as you get a reading.",
        "Check the reading level and squirt the water back into the cell.",
        "Look at the hash marks on the tube or reader to see what the specific gravity reading is.",
        "Once the float rests at a certain hash mark, jot it down then squeeze the ball at the top of the tube to squeeze the water back out into the tube.",
        "The charge levels differ for every battery, especially in golf carts.",
        "In general, a specific gravity between 1 and 1.2 is good for a car battery, so expect it to be around there or possibly a little less.",
        "Repeat this process for each cell in the battery.",
        "For every individual cell, stick the tube into the water, squeeze the ball to pull some water up, then lift the tube a little.",
        "Let the float settle and write down the level on a piece of scrap paper.",
        "Empty the tube by squeezing the ball at the top again and repeat the process until you\u2019ve measured each cell.",
        "Compare the levels in all 3 cells to one another.",
        "Each cell in a battery is separated, so to get a good picture of whether you battery is healthy or not, you need to check the charge levels in each cell to see if they\u2019re close.",
        "For example, If 2 of the cells have  similar readings but the third is much lower or higher, it\u2019s a sign that your battery is not generating power correctly and you should plan on replacing it in the near future.",
        "In general, the cells should be with 0.1 of one another.",
        "There may be more variation if your battery is older or hasn\u2019t been charged in a long time.",
        "A difference greater than 0.3 is pretty high."
