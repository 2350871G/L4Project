        "Be sure to use a stick blender.",
        "Don't use a hand mixer.",
        "It will agitate the mixture too much and result in splashes.",
        "Repeat stirring and blending process for about 10 minutes.",
        "The mixture is ready when it reaches the \u201ctrace\u201d stage.",
        "This is where you can drizzle some soap on top of itself and it leaves behind an impression.",
        "It will look a little like warm custard.",
        "Your soap may trace sooner than 10 minutes, especially if you used the olive oil and castor oil combo.",
        "Add 8 drops of grapefruit seed extract, then give the mixture a stir.",
        "This acts as an anti-oxidant, which is beneficial for your skin.",
        "It also helps keep the milk and oils from going rancid.",
        "Note that this won't preserve the soap.",
        "You can also add any essential oils at this point.",
        "Refer to a soap-making calculator to find out how much you should use.",
        "You can leave this out if you want to, especially if you used just olive oil (as opposed to the olive oil-castor oil combo.",
        "Olive oil preserves really well.",
        "Pouring, Cutting, and Curing the Soap Pour the soap into your desired mold.",
        "You can use just about anything as a soap mold, from baking pans to actual soap molds.",
        "To make demolding easier, line your mold with plastic, parchment paper, or freezer paper.",
        "If you don\u2019t have plastic, parchment paper, or freezer paper, try a spray-on mold release instead.",
        "Avoid using wax paper, however, as it tears too easily.",
        "If your mold is made from silicone, you don\u2019t need to line it with anything.",
        "Silicone is easy to demold because of how smooth it is.",
        "Cover the soap with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for 24 hours.",
        "Make sure that you press the plastic wrap directly against the top of the soap.",
        "The lye will still be caustic at this point, so be sure to wear gloves for this step.",
        "Refrigerating the soap will help it turn a light color.",
        "If you prefer a darker colored soap, leave it out on the counter for 24 hours.",
        "Take the soap out of the fridge and leave it alone for 3 to 4 days.",
        "You should do this even if you let the soap sit on the counter for 24 hours.",
        "In either case, leave the soap in its mold; do not take it out.",
        "This will allow the soap to harden up further.",
        "If the soap starts to develop cracks, it's getting too warm.",
        "Move it to a cooler location.",
        "If you demold the soap too soon, it may break or crack because of how soft it is.",
        "Take the soap out of the mold.",
        "How you do this depends on what type of mold you are using.",
        "In most cases, you should be able to just turn the mold upside-down and slide the soap out, like you would a cake.",
        "In some cases, however, you may have to take the entire mold apart.",
        "Be sure to remove the plastic wrap first!",
        "You can touch the soap with bare hands at this stage, but it's not ready to use.",
        "Cut the soap into 1 in (2.5 cm) thick bars.",
        "Use a special soap cutting blade for this or a non-serrated knife.",
        "If you poured the soap into individual molds, then you don't need to cut them further; they're already the perfect size.",
        "Leave the bars in a well-ventilated area out of sunlight for 3 to 4 weeks.",
        "Arrange the bars on a wire cooling rack some place cool and dry with good airflow.",
        "After about 1 or 2 weeks, flip the bars over, and let them finish curing for another week or 2.",
        "If you used just olive oil, instead of the olive oil-castor oil combo, let the soap cure for 4 to 6 weeks to instead.",
        "Once the bars of soap have finished curing, they are ready to use!",
        "Wrap them in plastic and sell them or give them away to family and friends."
