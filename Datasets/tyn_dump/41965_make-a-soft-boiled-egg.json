You can carefully use a small pin or tack to poke a very small indentation through the shell at the large end of the egg. Take care not to poke very far or the white will leak out of the egg. You could also use something with a slightly rounded point to poke the egg. For example, you could use a wooden pestle. If you use this, just tap the larger end of the egg."
