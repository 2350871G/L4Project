Sandwich your block of tofu between two paper towels, and apply pressure to the top of the block in order to drain excess water from your tofu. You can press water from your tofu with your hands, or by placing a heavy object on top of the tofu. Try placing a fruit bowl or a heavy plate on top of your tofu. Leave the object for 30 minutes or more to press the most water from your tofu. The more water you can press from your tofu, the more its texture will resemble fish. Slice your tofu into thick, 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide strips. Place the block of tofu on a cutting board, and use a sharp kitchen knife to divide your block of tofu into 6 thick, long strips. Depending on your preference, you can either divide these strips in half, to make 12 strips, or leave them as is. The goal is to create thick, meaty slabs of tofu that will resemble the texture of a sliced fish filet. Combine vegetable broth, tamari sauce, and garlic powder in a bowl. Use 2 cups (470 ml) of vegetable broth, 2 US tbsp (30 ml) of tamari sauce, and 1 tsp (4 g) of garlic powder. This mixture will serve as the marinade for your tofu fish. Together, the flavors of these ingredients will give your tofu a rich, salty flavor associated with seafood. Soak tofu strips in the marinade for at least 2 hours. Once your marinade is prepared, transfer your sliced tofu strips to the bowl and make sure they are fully submerged. Allow your tofu to marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, or even overnight so that the tofu can absorb maximum flavor. Wrap each tofu strip in a small piece of nori paper. Remove your tofu from the marinade, and pat it dry with a paper towel before wrapping each individual strip in a small piece of nori. Use a single sheet of nori paper divided into 6 to 12 equal parts, depending on how you\u2019ve divided your block of tofu. This step will help infuse the flavor of your tofu fish with that of the nori, yielding an even fishier result. Arrange your tofu strips on a lined baking sheet. Place your nori-wrapped tofu pieces on a baking sheet with about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) of space between each piece of tofu. Be sure that the nori is wrapped securely around each piece as you arrange them. Bake your tofu fish for 20 minutes at 200 \u00b0C (392 \u00b0F). When your tofu fish is finished, your strips should be golden brown and firm to the touch. When you bite into them, you should note a meaty texture and a mild flavor, reminiscent of seafood. Making Yuba Fish Soak 2 lb (32 oz) of dried yuba sheets in warm water for 6 hours. Place your dried yuba in a large bowl, and cover completely with warm water. Leave the yuba to soak for at least 6 hours. If possible, allow your yuba to soak overnight. Skip this step if you\u2019re using fresh yuba. Drain your yuba in a colander or fine mesh strainer. Once you\u2019ve drained the fluid from the bowl, use your hands to squeeze the excess liquid from your yuba. Your yuba should have a limp, floppy texture, and should feel relatively light once you\u2019re done draining. Chop your yuba into fine pieces then put it in a clean bowl. You\u2019ll want your yuba to resemble flaky, shredded meat, similar to the meat that would be used for a fish patty. If you\u2019re using a knife, you\u2019ll want a fine, thorough chop. If you\u2019re using a food processor, pulse the yuba for 5-10 seconds, being mindful not to chop the yuba so finely it becomes pasty. Add cornstarch, soy sauce, and shredded nori paper to the bowl. Use 0.25 cups (30 g) of cornstarch, 2 US tbsp (30 ml) of soy sauce, and 2 sheets of shredded nori paper. These ingredients will help flavor your yuba while making it easier to shape the shreds into fish patties. Divide your mixture into 8 patties. Scoop a palm-sized amount of your yuba mixture from the bowl, and use your hands to shape them into flat, round patties. Fry your patties for 4 minutes on each side. Heat a nonstick skillet over a stove set to medium-high heat. Fry your patties 2 at a time for 4 minutes or until they are golden brown. Remove them from the heat when they\u2019re crispy. Preparing Vegan Fish Sticks Drain the liquid from 2 14-oz cans of hearts of palm. Once you\u2019ve removed the water from the cans, pat your hearts of palm dry with paper towels. Try to absorb as much liquid as possible, as this will help your fish sticks take on a meatier texture. Hearts of palm have a texture similar to artichoke hearts, but with a very mild flavor, which makes them well-suited for seafood flavoring. Pulse the hearts of palm in a food processor for 5-10 seconds. You\u2019ll want the hearts of palm to appear thoroughly shredded, but not pasty. If you don\u2019t have a food processor, chop the hearts of palm as finely as possible with a sharp kitchen knife. Then, transfer them to a bowl. Add bread crumbs, Worcestershire sauce, celery seed, and salt. Use 0.5 cups (64 g) of bread crumbs, 1  tsp (4.9 ml) of Worcestershire sauce, 1  tsp (4.9 ml) of celery seed, and 0.5  tsp (2.5 ml) of salt. Mix all ingredients together in the bowl with a spoon until the mixture is uniform. Shape the mixture into 12 fish sticks. Scoop approximately 2 US tbsp (30 ml) of the mixture into your hands, and form 3 in (7.6 cm) long by 1 in (2.5 cm) wide logs. Try to make all of your fish sticks the same size, as this will help ensure that they fry at an even rate. Roll your fish sticks in breadcrumbs. To create a crisp outer layer on your vegan fish sticks, sprinkle a scant 1 cup (128 g) of breadcrumbs on a plate, and roll your heart of palm logs in the crumbs. Fry fish sticks in a stovetop skillet for 2-3 minutes on each side. Heat 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of vegetable oil in a skillet over high heat. Once the oil starts bubbling, add your fish sticks. Cook your sticks in batches of 3-4 at a time, and remove your fish sticks from the stove once they\u2019re golden brown and crispy.",
