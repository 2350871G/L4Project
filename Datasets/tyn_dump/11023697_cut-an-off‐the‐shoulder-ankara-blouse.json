For example, there should be enough space in the armholes for you to easily get the top on and off, but the holes shouldn't be so loose that they hang too far down the top.Variation: If you don't want to use another shirt as a guide, you can use a purchased blouse pattern. Unfold the pattern and lay it on the Ankara fabric before you pin it into place. If you don't have a tank top that you like the fit of, you can use a long-sleeve shirt that fits well. You'll just need to fold in the sleeves when you pin the shirt. Don't worry about destroying the tank top because you won't need to take it apart in order to pin it. Lay the tank top flat and fold the top 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 cm) over. Work on a flat surface and spread the tank top out. Then, hold the top of the shirt and fold it about halfway down the curve of the armholes. Depending on the size of the shirt, you'll need to fold about 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 cm) of the shirt towards you. Fold the top in half vertically in the middle. Now take a long side of the tank top and fold it to the opposite side so the shirt is folded in half vertically. This will be the guide for your Ankara blouse. The tank top will now be folded in a rectangle with a slightly curved corner. Spread the Ankara fabric and fold it in half. Unfold about 2 yards (6 feet) of Ankara fabric so the pattern is facing up. Then, fold it in half vertically so the wrong side is now facing you. If you prefer, you can use the wrong side of the Ankara fabric because it will also be vivid. You may want to do this if you prefer the mirror image of the pattern. Pin the outside of the top to the Ankara fabric. Lay the folded top onto the folded Ankara fabric so it's 2 inches (5.1 cm) away from the folded side. You should also leave about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between the top of the shirt and the top edge of the fabric. Then, use sewing pins to secure the sides of the top to the fabric. Leaving the 2 in (5.1 cm) space will make it easy to slip your Ankara blouse on and off easily. Cutting and Stitching the Body Add a \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) seam allowance and cut out the body template. Take a pair of sharp scissors or a rotary cutter and cut the Ankara fabric, adding a \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) allowance, around the template's top, bottom, and side. Remember not to cut along the side of the template which has the folded Ankara fabric. Try to leave 1 inch (2.5 cm) of fabric above the top line so you can attach a ruffled piece to the blouse. Unfold the fabric body piece and lay it on another piece of Ankara fabric. Now you can unpin the tank top template and set it aside. Unfold the body piece of Ankara fabric that you just cut and lay it flat on more Ankara fabric. Keep in mind that the body piece will be a little larger than your finished blouse since you've added fabric for the seam allowances. Cut out another matching body piece. To prevent the body piece from moving as you cut out another one, you may want to pin it in place. Keep the pins along the edge of the fabric so you don't make too many holes. Then, cut an identical piece of fabric. You should now have 2 matching pieces of Ankara fabric for the body of your blouse. Sew the sides of the body together using a straight stitch. Lay the 2 body pieces on top of each other so the patterned sides of the fabric are facing in towards each other. Pin the sides in place and then use a straight stitch on your sewing machine to sew down the long sides of the blouse. Then, hem around the armholes and along the bottom of the blouse.Tip: Remember to leave a \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) seam allowance. Try to make a few backstitches before you begin the straight stitches to prevent the stitches from unraveling over time. Adding a Ruffled Piece to the Top Measure around your shoulders with a measuring tape. Wrap a measuring tape around your shoulders where you'd like the top of your blouse to fall and make a note of the measurement. For example, your measurement might be 45 inches (110 cm). Add 12 to 20 inches (30 to 51 cm) to the measurement and divide it by 2. The amount you add to your measurement will determine how much room you have to move your arms, so if you want a loose fitting, flowy blouse, add more to the measurement. Then, divide the answer by 2 to get the length for your ruffled pieces. For example, you might add 15 inches (38 cm) to your measurement to get 60 inches (150 cm). Divide this by 2 to get 30 inches (76 cm). This is how long your ruffled pieces should be. Cut 2 matching rectangular pieces using the measurements. Lay down more Ankara fabric and mark the length you just calculated for the ruffled pieces. It's up to you to decide how long you want the ruffled piece to be, so measure and mark the length you want. Then, cut out the rectangular piece of fabric and use it as a template to cut out another piece in the same size.Tip: For an extra flowy blouse, make the ruffled piece even longer. Try cutting the rectangles about 12 inches (30 cm) wide. For example, your rectangle might measure 30 inches (76 cm) across and 10 inches (25 cm) wide. Stitch the short ends of the ruffled pieces and hem the long ends. Stack the rectangles together so the patterned side is facing in and pin along the short ends. Use the sewing machine to straight stitch the short ends together. Then, hem the bottom \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) of the piece. You don't need to hem the top of the rectangle yet because you'll be sewing in the elastic band. Turn the pieces right side out and position the ruffled piece at the top. Turn the body piece and rectangular ruffled piece right side out and lay them flat. Slide the rectangular piece into the body piece so it's wrapped around the top. Then, adjust the rectangle so the top, unfinished edge lines up with the top, unfinished edge of the body. You can eyeball this or measure both pieces to find the exact center. Pin the top edges together and sew them in place with a straight stitch. Keep the top of the body and ruffled piece together with pins and bring the fabric to your sewing machine. Straight stitch all across the top of the blouse and leave a \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) seam allowance as you go. Sew a casing near the top of the ruffled piece. Turn the blouse inside out and fold \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) of the top edge over. Then, fold it over again by \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) and pin the edge in place. Straight stitch along the bottom of the folded edge to keep the gap in place and stop stitching about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from where you started. It's important to leave a gap so you can slide the braided elastic through the top. Cut the braided elastic and push it through the top ruffled piece. Wrap \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) wide braided elastic around your shoulders where the top of the blouse will fall and add \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) to the measurement. Cut the braided elastic and hook a safety pin onto 1 end so you can feed it through the gap in the ruffled piece. When it reaches the end, remove the safety pin and sew the 2 ends of elastic together. Keep the elastic flat as you feed it through the top. Sew the gap closed and turn the Ankara blouse right side out. Straight stitch the 1 inch (2.5 cm) gap closed and then make a few stitches near the top of the arms to secure the elastic. This will keep it from sliding as you wear the blouse. Then, turn the blouse right side out and enjoy your new Ankara garment!",

        "Pin the top edges together and sew them in place with a straight stitch.",
        "Keep the top of the body and ruffled piece together with pins and bring the fabric to your sewing machine.",
        "Straight stitch all across the top of the blouse and leave a \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) seam allowance as you go.",
        "Sew a casing near the top of the ruffled piece.",
        "Turn the blouse inside out and fold \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) of the top edge over.",
        "Then, fold it over again by \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) and pin the edge in place.",
        "Straight stitch along the bottom of the folded edge to keep the gap in place and stop stitching about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from where you started.",
        "It's important to leave a gap so you can slide the braided elastic through the top.",
        "Cut the braided elastic and push it through the top ruffled piece.",

        "Keep the elastic flat as you feed it through the top.",
        "Sew the gap closed and turn the Ankara blouse right side out.",
        "Straight stitch the 1 inch (2.5 cm) gap closed and then make a few stitches near the top of the arms to secure the elastic.",
        "This will keep it from sliding as you wear the blouse.",
        "Then, turn the blouse right side out and enjoy your new Ankara garment!"
