    "text": " Making Hot Brew Green Tea Boil 4 cups (950 milliliters) of water in a large pot. If you would like to make a single serving, boil 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water in a kettle instead and pour it into a mug. Take the pot off the stove, and add 4 to 6 tea bags into the water. The more tea bags you use, the stronger your tea will become. If you would like to make a single serving, dip 1 tea bag into your mug. Let the tea steep for 3 minutes. Avoid steeping it for any longer, or the tea will turn bitter. If you'd like a stronger tea, simply use more tea bags. Take the tea bags out of the water. If you'd like, you can bob them up and down before taking them out to release any extra green tea goodness. Be sure to squeeze out any excess water from the bags before discarding them. Let the tea reach room temperature before you place it into the fridge. It may take up to an hour, depending on how warm or cold it is where you live. Don't put hot tea into the fridge; wait until it cools down a little first. If you put hot tea into the fridge, it may cause the surrounding food to go bad.

If you'd like to save some tea for later, pour it into a large mason jar or a pitcher, and put it into the fridge. The tea will last 3 to 5 days. Making Cold Brew Green Tea Fill a tall glass with 1 cup (240 milliliters) of cold or room temperature water. Brewing tea in hot water brings out the bitter flavors of tea. Brewing tea in cold or room temperature water does not do that. Instead, it gives you a smoother taste. If you'd more servings, switch to a pitcher and add 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water for serving you want to make. Add 1 green tea bag, or the equivalent of loose-leaf tea.

Plan on having 1 cup (240 milliliters) of iced tea per glass/serving. Take the tea bags out. Give them a squeeze to release any excess liquid. If you used loose-leaf tea, don't worry about it just yet. Pour the chilled tea into the ice-filled glass. If you used loose leaf tea, pour the tea through a strainer. If the tea leaves are finely ground, you may have to line the strainer with a coffee filter first. Sweeten the tea with honey, if desired, and serve. Be sure to stir the honey in well, if you are using it. If you made a lot of tea, store it in the fridge, and drink it within 3 to 5 days. Making Green Tea Lemonade Fill a mug with \u00bd cup (120 milliliters) of boiling water. You will be making a consecrated green tea lemonade first using a small amount of hot water. Don't worry, you will be adding more water to your tea later. Add 1 green tea bag into the water, and 2 tablespoons of sugar, if desired. If you'd like to use another type of sweetener, such as honey, skip the sugar; you will add the honey (or other sweetener) at the end. Let the tea brew for 3 minutes, then take out the tea bag.
