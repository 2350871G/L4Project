Use a sprayer for a long fence or a fence with lots of cutouts or spots that will be hard for a brush to get into. If you have a long fence, you probably will want to use a sprayer because it will allow you to complete the job quickly. A sprayer is also good at getting into every crevice, so use one if your fence has detailed scrolling work. If you have a smaller project, such as a short section of fence, you probably can complete the job using a roller on flat surfaces and a brush for detailed, inside sections."

        "Choose to use a brush, roller, or sprayer, or a combination of all three.",
        "What you choose typically depends on how much fence you need to paint.",
        "However, you should also consider what type of paint you\u2019re using and how detailed the work will be.",
        "For example, some paints are formulated to be used with either brushes or sprayers and state so on their labels.",
        "Use a sprayer for a long fence or a fence with lots of cutouts or spots that will be hard for a brush to get into.",
        "If you have a long fence, you probably will want to use a sprayer because it will allow you to complete the job quickly.",
        "A sprayer is also good at getting into every crevice, so use one if your fence has detailed scrolling work.",
        "If you have a smaller project, such as a short section of fence, you probably can complete the job using a roller on flat surfaces and a brush for detailed, inside sections.",
        "Pick a suitable day to do the painting.",
        "Certain weather conditions are ideal for fence painting.",
        "Pick a day with no rain in the forecast.",
        "Also, try to paint on a day with calm winds and ample cloud cover.",
        "Breezes can kick up debris that can stick to your paint job.",
        "Direct sunlight makes the paint dry too fast and saps its protective properties.",
        "Apply paint with the grain of the wood.",
        "If using a roller, roll it with the grain of the wood, rather than across it.",
        "Brush strokes should also go with the grain to ensure that every crevice in the wood is coated.",
        "Even if spraying you should move the sprayer in the direction of the wood grain to get into all areas of the wood.",
        "Going with the grain also helps prevent drips, as excess paint doesn\u2019t build up on the ridges of the wood as much.",
        "While it might not be possible to go with the grain for every single stroke, it\u2019s a good idea to do it as much as possible.",
        "Keep a brush handy to clean up drips.",
        "Even if you opt for a sprayer or a roller, it\u2019s important to keep a brush in arms reach.",
        "This will allow you to do any touch-up work that needs to be done right away.",
        "Painting a Metal Fence Choose a type of paint that will adhere to metal.",
        "There are certain paints that are specially formulated to stick to metal and it\u2019s important that you choose one that works with metal outside.",
        "Paints that work well for metal fences include:\nEnamels: Enamel paint is ideal for iron fencing and gates.",
        "Usually, you'll need to treat the surface with a rust-inhibiting primer.",
        "Automotive epoxy paint: The benefits of automotive epoxy are, it's a 1-step process and is very durable.",
        "You will have to mix in a hardener with this paint, which does force you to get the job done within about 6 hours.",
        "Choose to use a brush or sprayer.",
        "Because they're often intricately designed, you can paint small iron fences by hand but large areas may require spraying to get optimum coverage.",
        "A single heavy coat of enamel or automotive epoxy paint sprayed on is usually is enough to create a strong finish.",
        "If you want to spray the paint on, you need to decide between using a paint sprayer or cans of spray paint.",
        "Spray paint is only really appropriate for painting small fences.",
        "If you use brushes, be sure to use brushes that are compatible with your type of paint.",
        "For instance, if you are using enamel paint, look for brushes that say they can be used with enamel paint.",
        "In general, it\u2019s hard to paint a metal fence with a roller because there are few large, flat surfaces.",
        "The exception is chain-link fence, because you can run the roller along the surface of the fence and paint it very quickly and thoroughly.",
        "Pick a dry, temperate day to do the painting.",
        "It\u2019s important to look at the forecast before you start painting because a bit of rain or scorching hot temperatures can both negatively impact your paint job.",
        "Aim for a day that will not have rain but has overcast skies, as this will allow your paint to dry at the correct pace.Tip: In most climates, you don't want to paint a metal fence in the middle of summer or the middle of winter.",
        "Pick the time of year that is most temperate.",
        "Apply a primer.",
        "Most paints that are made for painting metal work best when applied over a rust-resistant primer.",
        "Choose a primer that comes in a spray can, can be sprayed with a sprayer, or that can be brushed or rolled on, whichever method you prefer.",
        "As you apply the primer, be sure that you cover every surface of the fence.",
        "Allow the primer to dry completely before applying the paint.",
        "Look at the information on your primer\u2019s container to determine how much time it will take to dry but typically it takes about 24 hours.Tip: Pick a color of primer that is close, but not exactly the same, as the paint you will use.",
        "Using a similar color will help you differentiate between where you have applied primer and where the final paint is applied.",
        "Apply the paint to your metal fence.",
        "Start at one end of the fence and work your way down it.",
        "Make sure to paint every surface as you go and clean up any drips that happen right away.",
        "If using a sprayer or spray can, spray downwind and wear a respirator.",
        "Keep a brush handy to clean up drips.",
        "Even if you opt for a sprayer or a roller, it\u2019s important to keep a brush in arms reach.",
        "This will allow you to do any touch-up work that needs to be done right away."
