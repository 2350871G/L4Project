Apply soda ash to the acid puddle, scrubbing the mixture with a pool brush. You will need to use 2 lb. (.9 kg) of soda ash per 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of acid. Pump the mixture into a bowl using a submersible pump. Dispose of what you pumped, as the acid can kill frogs, fish and plants. Rinse out the bowl. Pour water over any remaining residue, rinsing carefully around the drain."
