Don't worry if it looks uneven. You will continue to take off more length in the following steps and even things out some more. Don't cut too close to the person's head.

Then, cut the hair just below them. Repeat the process along the hairline, holding your fingers at a slight angle.

If you are cutting curly hair, plan on cutting it 1\u00bd to 2 inches (3.81 to 5.08 centimeters) long. Separate the front part of the hair from the back. Use the handle of a rat-tail comb to create a vertical part on each side of the head, just behind the ears. Each part should meet on the top of your head. Brush the hair in front of the ear forward, out of the way. If the hair won't stay forward, secure it with clips. Cut a vertical section of hair on the back-center of the head. Take a vertical section of hair from the back-center of the client's head, comb through it, and pinch it between your fore and middle fingers. Slide your fingers down to where you want to cut, then snip the hairs sticking out in front of your fingers. Pixie cuts are short\u2014no longer than 2 inches (5.08 centimeters). Cut a horizontal section of hair across the vertical one. Pinch a horizontal of hair, right across the section you just cut. Slide your fingers down until you see the cut ends of the vertical section. Cut the horizontal section so that it aligns with the vertical one. Continue to cut the hair in vertical and horizontal sections. Work your way towards the right side of the head, then repeat for the left side. Keep alternating between vertical and horizontal sections. This technique will allow you to measure up the already-cut strands against the un-cut strands. Stop when you get to the vertical parts just behind the ears. Blend the hair by combing it upwards and snipping it. Comb the hair upwards with a fine-toothed comb.

Pinch some of the cut strand against the un-cut strands so that you know how much to cut off.

        "Blend the bangs into the top part of your hair.",
        "Pinch a vertical section of the bangs between your fore and middle finger.",
        "Pull the hair upwards and measure it against the already cut strands on the top of the head.",
        "Angle your fingers, then cut the hair that's sticking out of them.",
        "Work your way from one side of the bangs to the other.",
        "Angle your fingers down into the bangs.",
        "This way, the hairs on the top of the bangs will blend into the hairs on the top of your head.",
        "Consider thinning the hair along the top and bangs.",
        "Pull a thin strand of hair upwards, then gently glide the scissors along the shaft, making short, tiny snips.",
        "Repeat this technique wherever you think the hair should be thinned (typically along the top and bangs).",
        "This technique works especially well for undercut pixies.",
        "Blend the thinning by pinching the strand between your fore and middle fingers, then cutting upwards into the hair with the scissors.",
        "Comb, dry, and style the hair, as desired.",
        "Pixie hair is fun and cheeky, so a simply blow-dry is all most people will need.",
        "You can spike the hair further with a little bit of hair wax or pomade.",
        "Check the hair after you've styled it.",
        "If necessary, you can trim areas that are too long."
