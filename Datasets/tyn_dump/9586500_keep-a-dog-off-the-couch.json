For example, if your dog usually curls up into a ball on the couch, buy a donut or bolster bed. If your dog likes to spread out on the couch, purchase a soft, cushion bed. Make sure that the bed is the right size for your dog. If you're uncertain or if your dog is between sizes, order a size up. It's better to get a bigger bed just in case, because smaller beds can lead to spine and neck problems"
