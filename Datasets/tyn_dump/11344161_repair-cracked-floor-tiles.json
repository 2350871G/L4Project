Cleaning the cracked tile will remove any dust and grime and ensure that the epoxy sticks to the surface of the tile itself. Both of these products are sold at every grocery store and drugstore. Mix together the epoxy on top of a spare sheet of cardboard. Use a popsicle stick to scrape out about 2 tablespoons (43 g) of epoxy mixture from each of the 2 bottles onto a sheet of cardboard. Stir the 2 parts of the epoxy together until they\u2019re fully blended. This will start a chemical reaction that hardens the epoxy. If you don\u2019t have extra cardboard lying around, you could also mix the epoxy on top of a strip of wax paper or scrap wood. Smear the mixed epoxy along the hairline fracture in the tile.

        "Slide under excess epoxy to remove it.",
        "Be careful while you\u2019re cutting epoxy with the razor blade.",
        "Razors are extremely sharp, and you could easily cut yourself if the blade slips.",
        "Tint the epoxy to match the color of your tile.",
        "You can purchase a powder dye (specifically made to dye epoxy) from any craft or hobby store.",
        "Mix the tinted powders (e.g., brown, gray, black) together until you create a color that matches your tiles.",
        "Following the manufacturer\u2019s directions, apply the dye powder to the epoxy until the location of the repaired crack is no longer visible.",
        "This step is optional.",
        "If you find that the epoxy is already close to the color of your tiles, you may choose to leave it undyed.",
        "Repairing Tile with Nail Polish Apply a thin layer of wood glue over the widest part of the crack.",
        "This method works well for cracks that are larger than small hairline cracks.",
        "Squeeze out a dollop of wood glue onto the crack on your tile.",
        "Use your finger or a chopstick to smear the wood glue lengthwise across any parts of the crack larger than 1 millimetre (0.039 in) across.",
        "Wait about 10 minutes for the glue to dry.",
        "Wood glue will expand and contract without losing its adhesion to the tile.",
        "This strengthens your repair and ensures that the repair job will last.",
        "Paint a thin layer of fingernail polish along the crack.",
        "Use the small brush that comes with the nail polish to draw the liquid polish out of the metal jar and onto the surface of the tile.",
        "Smear the polish along the crack in your tile until the entire crack is covered.",
        "Also cover 1\u20132 millimetres (0.039\u20130.079 in) on either side of the crack to make sure that it seals.",
        "This method of repairing tile will only work on tiles that have a glazed finish, not porous tiles.",
        "It\u2019s best to use a shade of nail polish that matches the surface of your tiles.",
        "For example, if you have light beige tiles, choose a light beige shade of nail polish.",
        "In some cases, if you can\u2019t find a shade of polish that matches your tile exactly, you may need to mix together 2 separate shades to create a matching polish.",
        "Wait 10 minutes for the fingernail polish to dry.",
        "The nail polish needs to fully dry before you finish repairing the cracked tile.",
        "To see if the nail polish is dry after 10 minutes, lightly tap it with a finger.",
        "If your finger comes away dry and the nail polish doesn\u2019t have the image of your fingerprint on it, the polish is dry.",
        "If the nail polish is still damp after 10 minutes, wait an additional 5 minutes.",
        "Remove any excess nail fingernail polish with nail polish remover.",
        "It\u2019s easy to accidentally get too much nail polish on the surface of the tile.",
        "To remove it, just pour a little bit of nail polish remove onto a gauze cotton swab.",
        "Smear the cotton swab across the excess nail polish 5\u20136 times to remove it.",
        "If the excess nail polish doesn\u2019t come off on the first try, use another cotton swab and more nail polish remover and try again.",
        "Replacing a Broken Tile Drill 3\u20134 small holes in the tile to weaken it for removal.",
        "Hold a power drill vertically above the broken tile so the bit will go straight down into the tile.",
        "Squeeze the trigger to start the drill, and drill a few holes to weaken the tile.",
        "The holes should be in a straight line in the center of the tile, going either horizontally or vertically across the tile face.",
        "If the drill kicks up small pieces of tile or creates dust, clean up after yourself with a dustpan and broom.",
        "Chip apart and remove the tile with a hammer and chisel.",
        "Place the blade of a chisel along the line of holes that you drilled in the tile.",
        "Tap on the butt end of the chisel with a hammer until the blade breaks through the tile.",
        "Tilt the chisel at a 45-degree angle and continue tapping it along so that it breaks all of the damaged tile away from the surface beneath it.",
        "Hammer with enough power to crack the tile but not so much force that you damage the wood beneath the tile.",
        "Also be careful not to damage any of the adjacent tiles!",
        "Once you\u2019ve removed the tile, throw it in the trash and sweep up the area.",
        "Scrape off any grout or mortar that remain beneath the tile.",
        "Grout is a tough, sticky material and will most likely have adhered to the wood under the tile.",
        "Hold the blade of the chisel at an acute 20-degree angle (relative to the floor) and slide it along the space where you just pulled the tile out.",
        "Scrape until you\u2019ve removed all of the grout.",
        "Throw the grout away in a trashcan that children and pets don\u2019t have access to (so they can\u2019t eat it).",
        "Find or purchase a new tile to replace the damaged tile you removed.",
        "Ideally, you\u2019ll have a spare tile or 2 left over from when the tile floor or counter was installed.",
        "If that\u2019s not the case, take a picture of the tile you\u2019re looking to replace.",
        "Bring it with you to a nearby home-improvement store or tile specialty store.",
        "Look for a tile that matches the tiles in your home as closely as possible.",
        "The sales staff will also be able to help you find a matching style of tile.",
        "Apply mortar to the base of a replacement tile.",
        "Put on a pair of latex gloves before you start working with mortar.",
        "Purchase a small tub of mortar and a putty knife from a local hardware store.",
        "Use the blade of the putty knife to scoop up a dollop of mortar and spread it evenly across the bottom side of the tile.",
        "When fully spread, the mortar should be about \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) thick.",
        "Be careful not to get mortar on any of the other tiles.",
        "It\u2019s hard to remove!",
        "Set the new tile in place and apply gentle pressure.",
        "Hold the tile so that it\u2019s centered over the hole that you removed the original tile from.",
        "Set the tile in the hole and press down lightly to seat the tile in place.",
        "If you apply too much pressure, excess mortar will be pressed out from beneath the tile and come up on its sides.",
        "Apply grout around the new tile using a grout float.",
        "Spread a small dollop of grout onto the bottom of a grout float.",
        "Run the grout float across the surface of the newly installed tile.",
        "Continue to apply grout on and around the tile until the small \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) gaps on all 4 sides of the tile are completely filled in.",
        "A grout float is a large, flat tool with a handle that you can use to spread grout around.",
        "You can purchase one at a hardware store or home-improvement store.",
        "Make sure to use a color of grout that matches the existing grout that surrounds other tiles!",
        "Wipe the towels clean with a damp rag.",
        "Before the grout dries, dampen a rag or old washcloth and use it to rub the new tile (and any other grout-covered tiles) clean.",
        "Make sure to leave the grout in the gaps surrounding the new tile undisturbed.",
        "Let the grout dry overnight, and your tile surface will be ready for use!",
        "If you forget to clean off the tiles for a few hours, removing the grout will be a much harder job!"
