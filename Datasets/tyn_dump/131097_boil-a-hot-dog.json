Boiling them for six minutes is enough time to get the hot dogs piping hot, but it's short enough to keep them from splitting down the middle. You want to avoid letting the hot dogs split, since they'll lose a lot of flavor if they do. If you're boiling a large pack of hot dogs, they may need an extra minute or two. Test a dog to see if it's ready before removing the rest of them from heat. If you're boiling just a dog or two, they may be ready before six minutes are up. Test a dog at five minutes to see if it's hot enough to suit you. If not, put it back in the water."
