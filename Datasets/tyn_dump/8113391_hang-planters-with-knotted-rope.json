        "Mark the holes for your pots.",
        "If the tier hole for your pot is too big, the pot will fall through, and if the hole is too small, the pot will be unbalanced and top-heavy.",
        "Measure and draw a second circle \u00bc\" (.64 cm) inside the outline of the mouth of the pot.",
        "You may find it easiest to dry this circle by:\nTying a writing utensil to one end of a length of string.",
        "Attach the string with a tack at the center of the outline of the mouth of the pot.",
        "Pulling the pencil to make the line taut.",
        "Measure the distance between the pencil and outline of the mouth of the pot.",
        "Shorten the string until the pencil, when held taut, is \u00bc\" (.64 cm) inside the outline.",
        "Keep the string taut as you draw on the wood to form your second circle, and repeat this process for all tiers.",
        "Cut the inner holes free of the wood.",
        "Clamp your wood so that the inner hole is positioned with nothing beneath it.",
        "Failing to do this will likely result in unnecessary cuts on your work surface.",
        "Then use your saw to cut the inner circle along the line you have marked until it comes free.",
        "Cutting from the edges will compromise the stability of your tiers.",
        "Instead, use your drill and boring bit to create a starting point for your saw at the center of your inner circle.",
        "Drill your rope holes.",
        "Measure and mark four points on each tier, with one point in each corner.",
        "These marks should be \u00bd\" (1.27 cm) from both edges of each corner.",
        "Then, use your drill and boring bit to drill holes at these points.",
        "Be extra careful when measuring and marking your rope holes.",
        "If these are inconsistent, your planter may hang crookedly.",
        "Plan the distance between tiers.",
        "The distance between your tiers will depend on the size of the plants you'll be putting in the pots.",
        "Taller plants will require more vertical space between tiers.",
        "In many cases, 1 foot (30.5 m) will be more than enough space separating tiers.",
        "Once you've decided the distance between tiers, you can estimate the amount of rope you'll need.",
        "Including the distance between tiers, you'll also need 1 foot (30.5 cm) of extra line to fasten the rope at the top.",
        "It's much easier to cut free extra rope than splice in more.",
        "For this reason, you may want to add a little length to your rope estimate.",
        "Attach the rope to your ring.",
        "Cut four stands from your rope, each one the same size.",
        "The length of your rope will be determined by your estimate, but in most cases, 30\" (.76 m) should be sufficient for a two-tier hanging planter.",
        "To fasten your rope:\nAlign all ends so they are collected together evenly.",
        "Thread one end of the strands through your metal ring, then tie it to the ring in an overhand knot.",
        "Strengthen your knot by applying a suitable, transparent glue to it.",
        "Cover the knot thoroughly in a thin layer of glue, then allow it to dry completely.",
        "Hang your tiered potted plants.",
        "Separate your strands of rope and feed one strand through each corner hole in your first wooden tier.",
        "Measure out the distance you planned, then tie a thick overhand knot below each corner hole.",
        "Repeat this for each tier.",
        "Once the knots have been tied beneath your final tier, your tiered hanging basket is complete.",
        "Hang the planter, insert pots into the center holes in each tier, and enjoy your handiwork.",
        "Adding Personal Touches Thread wooden accents and beads on your rope.",
        "The simple addition of wooden beads above the knotted portions of your rope can give your hanging planter a polished, professional look.",
        "Glass beads are also a great option, as these will catch the light and sparkle.",
        "In many cases, a hook or pin can hung from excess rope below your hanging planter to fasten other ornaments and knickknacks as well.",
        "Apply paint to hanging planters.",
        "You may want to paint your planter so its coloring matches your home decor.",
        "For most kinds of rope, acrylic pant can be applied directly to it directly to change its color.",
        "If you want to paint your wooden tiers, you'll have best results if you sand, clean, prime, and paint the tiers in that order.",
        "Braid and weave excess rope to create unique designs.",
        "Surplus rope at the bottom of your planter doesn't have to be cut away.",
        "You can turn this into an interesting design with a simple braid or weave.",
        "Give your braid or weave character by inserting beads, coins, and other accents."
