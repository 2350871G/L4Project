        "When you\u2019re finished, wait at least 5 hours before painting so the primer has time to dry completely.",
        "If there are nail heads or stains on the wood that need extra coverage, coat them individually with primer to start.",
        "After waiting for the primer to dry completely, follow up by coating the entire area with primer.",
        "Apply 2 coats of exterior latex paint, and consider mildew-resistant options.",
        "Brush on the paint in the same manner as you did the primer, using long, even strokes that go with the grain of the wood.",
        "Wait at least 1-2 hours between coats.",
        "If mildew is an issue on your siding, choose an exterior latex paint that has a mildewcide mixed in.",
        "If you don\u2019t have the paint that\u2019s already on the siding, take a chip of paint that you scraped off the siding to a paint store.",
        "They can color-match a new can of paint for you.",
        "Even with color-matched paint, the touched-up areas will likely not blend in completely with the rest of the paint job.",
        "Eventually, you will want to repaint all the siding\u2014likely every 5-7 years.",
        "Doing Other Maintenance Cut back any tree limbs or shrubs that are touching the siding.",
        "It\u2019s important that no type of plant life ever remains in contact with wood siding.",
        "Otherwise, the plants will serve as moisture delivery systems to the siding, keeping it damp and promoting mildew and rot.",
        "At the very least, there should be 1 ft (30 cm) of space between your siding and any plant life.",
        "While the shade provided by trees can help keep your home cooler in summer, it can also promote mildew formation on your siding in the shaded areas.",
        "You\u2019ll have to weigh the benefits versus the costs of this trade-off.",
        "Reapply water repellent stain to stained siding every year.",
        "Wash the siding with soapy water and a soft bristle brush, and remove any mildew or rust with specialized cleaners.",
        "After rinsing the siding and letting it dry completely, lightly sand the entire surface with a fine-grit (120-240 grit) sanding block or orbital sander, then wipe away the dust with tack cloths.",
        "Apply 1-2 coats of water repellent wood stain (clear or tinted) according to the product instructions.",
        "Use long, steady strokes with a brush or roller to apply an even coat of stain.",
        "Unlike painting, you shouldn\u2019t try to touch-up the stain in certain spots.",
        "It needs a new, full coating every year.",
        "Reapplying stain to the entire exterior of a home is as challenging as painting it, so you may want to consider hiring a pro to do the job.",
        "Replace damaged or missing caulk as soon as you notice it.",
        "Wood siding requires caulking around doors and windows, and often in areas like corners, in order to prevent water infiltration.",
        "If you see loose or missing caulk, scrape out any remaining loose bits with a paint scraper blade.",
        "Then, use a caulking gun to squeeze out a steady, even bead of caulk to fill in the missing areas.",
        "Make sure you choose a caulk that\u2019s designed for exterior use on wood surfaces.",
        "Wait until it\u2019s at least 45 \u00b0F (7 \u00b0C) outside to apply exterior caulk.",
        "Allow the caulk to dry for at least 24 hours before disturbing it or exposing it to water.",
        "Contact a professional to repair or replace loose or broken siding.",
        "It may be tempting to grab a hammer and a few galvanized nails to secure a loose piece of siding back into place.",
        "However, unless you have prior experience working with exterior wood siding, it\u2019s best to leave repairs to the pros.",
        "Poorly-done siding repairs are invitations for water infiltration and rot.",
        "Unfortunately, wood siding repairs usually aren\u2019t cheap.",
        "Expect to pay around $200-$300 USD to have 1-2 full boards replaced."
