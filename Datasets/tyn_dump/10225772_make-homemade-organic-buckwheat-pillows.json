                    "description": "Buckwheat pillows are heavier than regular pillows, so you need to choose your fabric carefully. Avoid fabric that feels thin and weak. The last thing you want is to wake up with buckwheat hulls all over your bed. Also, choose a fabric made without pesticides or other chemicals to keep your pillows 100% organic. A medium-weight fabric is a good choice for standard-size pillows. Aim for fabric about 5 to 7 oz (140 to 200 g) per 1 yd (0.91 m). For smaller \u201cJapanese-style\u201d pillows, the fabric can be thinner because you won\u2019t need to add as much filling. Cotton can be organic and is a good choice for soft pillowcases. Silk and linen are often softer than cotton but more expensive. Hemp and bamboo are a few organic choices for sturdier pillowcases."

Make sure you get buckwheat hulls, which look like nut shells, instead of buckwheat flour or another product. Standard-size pillows hold up to 9 lb (4.1 kg) of buckwheat, so you can adjust the amount you use. Using more buckwheat leads to a fuller pillow. Use less for smaller pillows."

        "Try to fold the zipper as evenly as possible.",
        "It can be tough, especially with stronger fabrics.",
        "Sew straight stitches all the way down the fabric\u2019s side.",
        "Now it is time to sew the loose ends of the fabric together.",
        "Start right below the folded zipper, which will be underneath the fabric.",
        "Work about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) from the edge of the fabric.",
        "Stitch all the way down until you are close to the other end of the fabric.",
        "Go as slow as you need to.",
        "Thicker material like suede can be a little stubborn, so take your time to get the stitching right.",
        "Remember to backstitch the edges to keep them strong.",
        "Pivot the fabric and sew the remaining sides.",
        "When you reach the corner of the fabric, turn it and start sewing down the next side.",
        "Always stay \u20442 in (1.3 cm) away from the fabric\u2019s edge.",
        "Repeat this until you have sewn up all of the loose edges.",
        "When you get back around to the zipper, move the tab out of the way and smooth out the fabric.",
        "Avoid sewing over the zipper.",
        "Turn the pillowcase inside out and fill it with hulls.",
        "The pillowcase is all done!",
        "All you have to do is pour the buckwheat hulls directly into it.",
        "Pull the zipper back up to seal the hulls in, then give your new pillow a test run.",
        "If it doesn\u2019t feel comfortable, you can easily undo the zipper and change the amount of buckwheat inside it."
