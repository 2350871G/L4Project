Measure from the point where the mattress touches the box spring to the top of the mattress. Add 3 inches (7.6 cm) to that number. A 12-inch (30.5-cm) deep mattress will have a drop length of 15 inches (31 cm). Determine the comforter's width. Multiply the drop length by 2. A drop length of 15 inches (31 cm) gives you 30 inches (76. 2 cm). Add the sum to the width of the mattress. A 54-inch (137-cm) wide mattress results in 84 inches (213.4 cm). Calculate the comforter's length. Multiply the drop length by 2. A drop length of 15 inches (31 cm) gives you 30 inches (76.2 cm). Add the sum to the mattress length.

Align the outer edge of the tape with the edge of the fabric. The folded side of the bias should face down. Pin the corners flat. Attach the backing. Place the backing face down on top of the fabric. Align the edges of the backing with the outer edges of the bias tape and fabric. Use straight pins to pin the backing onto the bias tape, fabric and batting. Sew the comforter together. Use a sewing machine to sew along the edges of the backing, fabric, bias tape and batting on 3 sides. Sew along the edges of the fourth side until you are 12 inches (30.5 cm) from the end. Do not sew the last 12 inches (30.5 cm) of the comforter. Remove the extra batting. Use scissors to trim the extra batting from the comforter. Flip the comforter right side out.
