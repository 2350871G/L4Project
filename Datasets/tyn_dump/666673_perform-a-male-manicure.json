If your bowl isn\u2019t large enough to soak both hands at once, it\u2019s best to use two smaller bowls so you can still soak your hands at the same time. If you have to soak the hands separately, the water will likely cool by the time you\u2019re ready to soak the second hand. Dump out the old water, and refill it with warm water.
