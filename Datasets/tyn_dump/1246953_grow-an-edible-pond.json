        "Use plastic pots that have plenty of holes for the water to go in and out of the root system.",
        "Line your pot with newspaper, then put in a scoop of organic garden soil.",
        "Once your pot is filled about halfway, place the plant\u2019s roots gently on top of the soil and then fill in the area around them with soil until the base of the plant is securely buried.",
        "If you purchased your plants from a garden center they may already be in plastic, permeable containers.",
        "If this is the case, you can move on to the next step.",
        "You can find plastic planters and organic gardening soil at most garden centers.",
        "Spread a thin layer of gravel on top of the soil to keep the water clear.",
        "The gravel will help weigh the plant down and stabilize it.",

        "Larger rocks can be used as needed to keep plants submerged.",
        "Submerge potted plants to create your water garden.",

        "They also can help turn any pond plant into helpful surface coverage.",
        "Design a visually-appealing garden.",
        "A pond garden is something you can eat, but it can also be a charming addition to a garden, deck, patio, or sunroom.",
        "For a striking display, place the tallest plants, like cattails, in the center of the pond with lower-lying, surface-cover plants around the outside.",
        "An alternative arrangement is to place taller plants along the back of the pond with shorter plants along the front edge.",
        "This layout works well if your pond backs up to a fence, wall, or patio edge.",
        "Getting Your Plants Buy a mix of plants from a reputable pond supplier in person or online.",
        "It\u2019s important to make sure you are getting what you want and need when you buy your pond plants.",

        "Buy a selection of bog-loving plants for variety.",
        "There are some great edible plants that will grow happily in your pond under bog conditions, which means they love water-logged soil but don\u2019t want to sit more than 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) under the water.",
