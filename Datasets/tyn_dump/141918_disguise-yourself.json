If you want to disguise yourself, though, you're going to want to pick something that won't draw attention--a blue mohawk or a pink costume wig probably aren't the best choices. Men can style their hair differently by using products like hair spray or gel to create a more elaborate \"do\" than usual, or could shave their head completely. Also consider a dye-job, or using cheap talcum powder to make some gray streaks that will really throw people. If you have facial hair, shave it into a different shape or get rid of it completely. If you don't have any, consider growing a beard or a sneaky mustache. Women can consider getting a realistic-looking wig or extensions to change the basic shape of their hair. You can also quickly go back to your \"old\" style that way, if you want to for further disguises. Keep them guessing by changing frequently and without warning. Dye your hair a different color each week and ensure that you'll never be noticed. Try combinations of highlight patterns and full dye jobs."
