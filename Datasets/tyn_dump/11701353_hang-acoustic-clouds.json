                    "description": "If the room receives a roughly equal amount of noise throughout, then the ceiling above the middle of the room is the best location to absorb the most sound waves to reduce noise and reverberation. If there\u2019s an area that produces much more noise, such as a bar or seating area, choose above that location to place your clouds. For example, if you have a piano or a drumset in the room, placing the acoustic clouds above them will help reduce reflected sound. Placing the acoustic clouds in a corner or against a wall will make them less effective.Tip: If you\u2019re hanging multiple panels, place them above the areas that will produce noise, such as a speaker or stage, as well as above the seating area or the area where people are likely to be talking so the 2 sounds don\u2019t overpower each other. You can hang as many panels as you like to reduce the overall noise in the room."
