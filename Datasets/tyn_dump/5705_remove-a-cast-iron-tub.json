If your tub is built-in to your home, access the bottom of the tub via a crawlspace or basement and twist the pipe loose with water pump pliers or a pipe wrench. Remember that your new tub will have new piping. With that in mind, never cut the plumbing that's connected to your home. Rock the reciprocating saw up and down as you cut to move faster. Be sure to grip the handle firmly with your dominant hand and hold the front grip tightly with your non-dominant hand to guide to saw. Focus on keeping a tight grip on the saw while applying pressure to the tool. Make sure the saw's shoe (the flat edges parallel to the blade that guide it) is pressed tightly against the piping to reduce vibrations. Wear gloves and a safety mask when using a reciprocating saw."

Taking the Tub off the Wall Remove the wall strip starting 6 inches (15 cm) or less above your tub to reveal the flange.

Lay down plywood sheets onto the floor around your tub. After removing your tub, you need to set it down somewhere.
