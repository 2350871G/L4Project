    "text": " Painting the Door Choose a paint color. If a lot of people pass the door each day, you might want to consider camouflaging the door with the color of nearby walls. If you don't have a paint color or wallpaper sample on hand, consider going to a hardware store to find a physical color sample. This will help you to find a paint color that matches your walls. If your door has a trim, you should decide early on if you want the trim and door to be the same color. Determine the amount of paint needed to paint the door. While it may be tempting to buy a gallon, you should check and see how much paint is really needed to paint your door. Free online calculators are available to help you figure out how paint your project will require. If you want to take extra precautions and avoid any paint splatter, consider buying drop cloths, painter's tape, paint trays, and stir sticks. This will help to save you cleanup time later. Sand the door with 220 grit sandpaper. Use a piece or block of coarse sandpaper to remove any visible blemishes. You don't need to spend a lot of time sanding, as long as you sand the entire surface. Some people prefer to unhinge the door so they can work on a level surface. Use pieces or blocks of sandpaper instead of a power sander, as a power sander may melt the old paint. Put painter's tape around the door and place drop cloths on the floor. Use as many strips of tape as you need to comfortably section away the area you want to paint. Put the drop cloths in places on the floor where you think that paint is most likely to drip.
