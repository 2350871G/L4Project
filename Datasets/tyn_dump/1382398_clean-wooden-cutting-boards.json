Keep it sealed and seasoned with a light coating of mineral oil. Warm a small amount of oil in your hands, and then spread it on the surface of the cutting board. Let it sit for a few minutes, then wipe off with a clean rag or paper towel. Then flip over the cutting board and season the other side too. You should season your cutting board about once a month, and every time you sanitize it. Don\u2019t use natural oils to seal the wood, because they can go bad. Mineral oil should do the trick."

A plastic or well-seasoned wooden cutting board should be used for high-risk foods, including raw meat, poultry, seafood, and tofu. A separate cutting board should be used for breads, cooked meats, cheese, fermented soy (like tempeh) and washed fruits and vegetables. Both boards should be cleaned after use, and it\u2019s important not to mix them up. Otherwise, you run the risk of cross-contamination."

This is especially helpful if you\u2019ve noticed your board getting a little smelly or stained. If you notice your cutting board is clinging on to the scents of strong foods, vinegar can help! Soak a paper towel in white vinegar, then wipe it across the surface of the cutting board. This will neutralize the odors without making the wood smell like vinegar in the long term. Another time-honored trick is sprinkling salt over the cutting board\u2019s surface while it\u2019s still wet. The salt draws out moisture trapped in the board\u2019s cracks, along with any bacteria that might be hiding. Stains can be dealt with using science-fair volcano ingredients, too. Try sprinkling baking soda over the discolored area, then scrub the baking soda into the wood using half a lemon. Afterwards, wash and dry the board."
