        "If your opponent hits it, they may knock the stone into the house.",
        "They need to either knock the stone away or go around it.",
        "Areas with lots of guards can create headaches for the opposing team.",
        "Getting stones to the house involves working around guards and understanding how they will move when hit by an incoming stone.",
        "Make a draw shot to get a stone into the house.",
        "Draw shots are designed to get stones around guards.",
        "While they can be straight shots, many involve curling the stone with great precision.",
        "To curl a draw shot, turn the stone\u2019s handle right before you let go of it.",
        "Then, let the sweepers guide the stone around the guard and back towards where you want it to end up.",
        "These are some of the most strategic shots you can choose and some of the hardest to implement.",
        "They become more integral as stones begin filling the playing area during each end.",
        "For instance, if you have a guard in front of the house, aim your stone to the right of it.",
        "Turn the handle counterclockwise to spin the stone back towards the house.",
        "Use a takeout shot to remove guards from the playing area.",
        "Takeout shots are thrown with such force that they knock the opposing team\u2019s stones out of play.",
        "Stones thrown for speed and power are often takeouts.",
        "Takeout shots have to be performed carefully, or else you can knock your own stones out of the house.",
        "For example, if your opponent has a guard in the button, you can knock it away with a takeout shot.",
        "Throw your stone with the right amount of power to bump your opponent\u2019s stone while stopping yours in the house.",
        "Be careful when knocking out stones.",
        "You can easily knock your opponent\u2019s stone into the scoring area.",
        "You can also knock in your own guard stones or take your stones out of play."
