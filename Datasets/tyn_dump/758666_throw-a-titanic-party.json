Decorating the Party Space Make a boardwalk for the entrance to your party. Corrugated cardboard, especially from an old box, is a good inexpensive choice. Tape several pieces together if one piece is not long enough. Cover the finished boardwalk with white contact paper. Add paper waves around the boardwalk.

Consider making an area where guests can sit to watch the movie. Place some extra chairs near the sofa. Lay some large pillow or cushions on the floor if your guests want to spread out. It's always good to have a place for everyone to relax and have fun. Plan a karaoke night.
