These common detergents found in shampoos make curly hair frizzy and uncooperative. Conditioner can be used sufficiently to clean the hair in a much more gentle manner.

Yet most shampoos contain harsh detergents (sodium lauryl sulfate or laureth sulfate) that one also finds in dish washing liquid. They're great for pots and pans because they cut grease so effectively. Your hair, on the other hand, needs to retain some natural oils, which protect your hair and scalp.

Curly hair should be cut when it\u2019s dry because hair tends to shrink when wet. On average, hair shrinks about 40% when wet, making it hard to tell what the hair will look like when dry. Also, take into account that curly hair is much shorter when dry than wet. You may lose only two inches while wet, but that could be four or five while dry! If you're constantly styling your hair, or if your hair grows faster than normal, a trim may be needed more often than every 4-6 months. On average, hair grows about half an inch per month."

        "Only dry your hair partially (about 80 percent dry) and air-dry the rest of the way.Do not touch your hair while it is drying or it will mess up and frizz.",
        "Both types of diffusers work well in terms of diffusing and decreasing frizz:\nA bowl diffuser with fingers causes more volume and clumping (curls sticking together instead of going every which way), is bulky and heavier, and will probably only fit on the hairdryer it comes with.",
