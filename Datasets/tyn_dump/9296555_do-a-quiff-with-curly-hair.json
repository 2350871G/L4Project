    "text": " Styling an Undercut Start with an undercut. This is where your hair is cut short on the sides and/or back, and left long on the top and/or sides. If your hair is very thick, it would be a good idea to add some layers to the top to help reduce weight. You may also want to ask the stylist to texturize your hair when you are getting an undercut. This helps to reduce bulk. Get your hair wet. How you do this is up to you. You can take a shower, stick it under a running faucet, or mist it with water and run a comb through it. Once you have your hair wet, dry it off with a towel so that it is damp and no longer dripping. Apply your choice of styling product. What sort of product you use depends on what you want to do with your hair and how you plan on drying it. If you want to blow-dry your hair straight, go for a volumizing or texturizing mousse. If you want to keep your natural texture, reach for the gel instead. Apply the product from roots to end, using a comb or your fingers to distribute it. Brush your hair while blow drying it for a sleeker look. Pull your hair back as you blow dry it, then place the brush behind your hair and rotate it backwards.

You want the long part of your hair to be swept back over the top of your head without hanging over the sides. If the quiff is not staying in place, rub a pea-sized amount of pomade between your palms, then smooth it over your quiff. Work it into your hair with your fingers for a textured look, or comb it through for a more polished one. Set the style with a light misting of hairspray. Once the hairspray has dried, you are good to go. Styling Uncut Hair Brush out your hair. This style works on any length of hair and will give you a \"faux\" quiff. You do not need to have your hair cut short or into an undercut. Section off the top part of your hair. Use the handle of a rat-tail comb to create two side parts on each side of your head, one above each eyebrow. Angle the parts towards the back of your crown. The section should span the width of your forehead. Keep the hair on the sides of your head out of the way by pinning it down with bobby pins. Apply mousse or hairspray. If you want to add a little more volume to your quiff, use a volumizing product, otherwise, go for something with good holding power. Run a brush or wide-toothed comb through your hair to help distribute the product from roots to ends. You only need to do this to the gathered top section of hair. Leave the hair on the sides and back of your head alone. Backcomb your hair, starting from the crown. Brush your hair forward across your forehead. Grab a horizontal section of hair, tease the back with a fine-toothed comb, then drape it gently over the back of your head. Repeat the process until you reach your hairline, working your way from back-to-front. Tease your hair less and less as you get closer to the front. This will give you a smoother finish. Secure your quiff with bobby pins that are the same color as your hair. Sweep your quiff back so that it lays between the two side parts. Adjust the height and width of the quiff to suit your personal taste and face shape. Use bobby pins that are the same color as your hair to keep it in place, if you need to. Slick the rest of your hair back at the sides. Apply some gel or pomade to the remaining hair on the sides of your head. Brush or comb the hair backwards, past your ears. Secure it behind your ears with bobby pins. If you secured the sides of your hair with bobby pins earlier, take them out first. If your hair is long enough, you pull it into a high ponytail even a half-up, half-down ponytail. Set the style with hairspray. You can also use hairspray to add shine to your quiff, but be careful not to overdo it. Not only can this weigh your hair down, but it can also make it look fake.",
