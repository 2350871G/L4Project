With a set of glasses, you can make a musical instrument with a sound remarkably similar to Ben Franklin's invention. Assemble a set of glassware. To create an instrument with a chromatic range of two octaves, you will need 25 glasses. For best results, use crystal glassware. The glasses don't need to be identical, but should be the same height for ease of playing. Select and tune the first glass by gently tapping on it or running your finger around the rim. Add water to the glass to lower the pitch until it plays the desired note. Use a guitar tuner, available online or at a music store, or download an app to your computer or phone. Take a glass of the same size as the first and add water until it is at the same level as the first glass. Test the pitch, then remove enough water to make the glass sound one half-step higher than the previous glass. Continue until you have tuned the glasses to complete the instrument. Use a permanent marker to indicate the appropriate water level, if desired. Set the tuned glasses on a firm base, making sure the glasses are attached to the base to avoid the glasses moving or falling over."
