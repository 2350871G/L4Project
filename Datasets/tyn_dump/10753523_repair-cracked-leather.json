Spray the cleaner on the cloth, then wipe away any grime on the leather. Rub along the leather\u2019s grain to avoid deepening the cracks. If you don\u2019t have a commercial cleaner, mix together 1 part mild soap with 8 parts distilled water. Use baby soap or a liquid dish or hand soap. Using a small amount of water is a safe way to rinse off soap. Dampen the microfiber cloth, wringing out the excess moisture, then wipe the leather along its grain."

To speed up the drying process, wipe the leather with a microfiber cloth. Make sure the surface feels dry to the touch so the soap or cleaner doesn\u2019t get in the way of the conditioner."

Put a small dollop of the conditioner on your finger or a soft applicator like a sponge or cloth. Then, rub the conditioner directly into the cracks in order to clean out the fabric\u2019s pores and prepare them for deeper conditioning. Leather conditioner is available wherever leather items are sold, particularly online, at general stores, and at some clothing shops. The leather will absorb the cleaner right away. This happens with items that have dried out over time. Regular conditioning keeps leather soft and pliable."

The leather will become a more consistent color, hiding the cracks. If the leather hasn\u2019t been conditioned in a while, consider treating the entire item now.

Wait until it feels dry to the touch before continuing to treat it. If you have the time, let the leather dry overnight. Waiting a little longer gives the conditioner plenty of time to rehydrate the leather."

Check the leather again the next morning after giving it plenty of time to dry. Continue treating the leather until the cracks are gone or the leather stops absorbing the conditioner. If it stops absorbing the conditioner but the cracks are still visible, you will need to try a filler or dye."

        "Using higher grit or ultra fine sandpaper is safe, but avoid harsher sandpapers.",
        "Lower-grit papers are coarser and more likely to leave noticeable scratches.",
        "Spread a leather filler over the cracks with a palette knife.",
        "Leather fillers are paste-like products that come in small tubs.",
        "Pick up some of the paste with the knife, then brush it onto the cracks to fill them with a thin layer of paste.",
        "Apply additional paste until all the cracks appear filled.",
        "Palette knives are thin and fairly blunt, making them a great choice for spreading the paste.",
        "If you don\u2019t have one, use another blunt object like a credit card.",
        "Avoid sharp knives or other objects that will scratch the leather.",
        "Leather fillers are available online and at some general stores.",
        "They are often sold in kits that may include a sanding pad and an applicator knife.",
        "Remove excess paste with the edge of the knife.",
        "After spreading the filler, you will probably have a fair amount outside of the cracks.",
        "Tilt the palette knife sideways, then scrape its edge gently over the leather.",
        "It will pick up the remaining paste.",
        "Continue removing the paste until you can no longer see it outside of the cracked areas.",
        "Place the excess filler in the cracks, back in the container, or wash the knife off in water as needed to remove it.",
        "Let the leather dry for 6 hours until the filler solidifies.",
        "Leave the filler exposed to open air so it dries faster.",
        "To protect your leather item, keep it out of direct sunlight and away from extreme heat.",
        "Heat sources like heaters and ovens run the risk of drying out the leather, causing it to crack further.",
        "Apply more coatings of filler as needed to even out the cracks.",
        "The filler shrinks as it dries, so you will need to apply a second layer.",
        "Spread more filler with a palette knife or a similar blunt object.",
        "Scrape up the excess, then wait for then new layer to dry.",
        "When the leather is repaired, the cracks will no longer be distinguishable.",
        "Depending on how deep the cracks are, you may need to apply additional layers of filler.",
        "Some cracks require as many as 5 coatings.",
        "Repeat the treatment until the cracks are well-filled.",
        "Blending Cracks with a Leather Dye Treat cracks with leather filler to blend the coloring in better.",
        "If you don\u2019t use filler first, you apply the dye or paint directly to the leather.",
        "This is enough to repair most cracks, but they may still be easy to spot.",
        "Filler is colorless, so it does a better job of permanently hiding bad cracks.",
        "For particularly deep or ugly cracks, add filler first so they don\u2019t stand out as much.",
        "Sand the leather with 600-grit sandpaper and wipe it clean.",
        "Smooth out the cracks to prepare them for the dye.",
        "Press the sandpaper or sanding pad down gently and rub along the leather\u2019s grain.",
        "Make sure the leather feels smooth to the touch.",
        "Wipe up the dust with a clean microfiber cloth.",
        "Use the cloth to clear out any dust that falls into the cracks.",
        "Leftover dust prevents the leather from absorbing the coloring evenly.",
        "Spread a thin coat of leather dye over the cracks with a sponge.",
        "Leather dye comes in a variety of colors, so choose a bottle that matches your item.",
        "Then, pour a little bit of the dye on a sponge or applicator pad.",
        "Rub the cracks to spread the dye into them.",
        "Leather dye is available online or at some craft and general stores.",
        "They are sometimes sold in kits that include sandpaper and applicator pads.",
        "Another way to color cracks is with spray paint and lacquer thinner.",
        "Get a matching color of spray paint safe for use on leather.",
        "Spray some of the paint on a cloth, then pour the lacquer on the cloth.",
        "Rub the cloth against the cracks to color them.",
        "Dry the dye for 2 minutes with a hairdryer set to high.",
        "Plug in the hairdryer and point it directly at the dyed areas.",
        "Move the heater back and forth across the cracks to prevent the leather from drying out.",
        "After you\u2019re done, the layer of dye will be dry to the touch.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a hairdryer, try an alternative heat source, such as a heat gun.",
        "Be careful, since heat guns can easily burn leather.",
        "Move the gun around to prevent any spots from overheating.",
        "Blend the cracks with multiple coats of dye as needed.",
        "Cracks generally require 2 to 5 treatments before they look repaired.",
        "Spread more of the dye over the leather.",
        "This time, dab some of the dye directly into the crack, then rub the area around the cracks to blend them together.",
        "Dry the dye each time with a hairdryer.",
        "Keep applying dye until the cracks are indistinguishable from the rest of the leather.",
        "Treat the cracks with a leather sealer to protect the dye.",
        "Spray the sealer onto a clean sponge or applicator pad.",
        "Then, rub the cracked area, applying a second coating as needed to cover all of the dye.",
        "The sealer acts as a conditioner that also protects the cracked area from stains and further damage.",
        "Purchase a bottle of leather sealer online or at your local general store.",
        "Heat the sealer with a hair dryer for 2 minutes to cure it.",
        "Activate the dryer one last time to finish the repair.",
        "Hold the heater close to the leather, pointing it directly at the treated area.",
        "Move the heater back and forth to prevent the leather from overheating.",
        "Once the leather feels dry to the touch, check it to make sure it looks as good as new."
