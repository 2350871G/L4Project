You can use a juicer, a blender, or a centrifuge, a rare kitchen gadget commonly used in labs, which uses rotational forces to separate high and low density particles. Not all juicers are made the same, but a typical assembly involves attaching a blade, filter, chute, and juice and pulp containers to a juicer base. Connect the juicer to an electrical outlet and make sure it\u2019s set to \u201con.\u201d\nA typical blender assembly involves inserting a blade inside of a container and connecting the container to a base, which plugs into an electrical outlet. A kitchen centrifuge is a small rectangular machine that spins several bottles on a rotor at a high speed to apply gravitational force. It may already come assembled. If not, assembly usually requires you to lift the top and secure the rotor on the base. The rotor should have a number of holes which hold bottles. You\u2019ll fill those bottles with contents, and then place them in the holes of the rotor."
