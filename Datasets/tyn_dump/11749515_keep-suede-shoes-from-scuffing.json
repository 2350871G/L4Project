It will not waterproof your suede though. Reapply the suede protector every 3-6 months after cleaning your suede to keep your shoes protected."

Water will not directly cause scuff marks, but the suede is more likely to scuff if it\u2019s wet. Scuff marks on suede are caused by matted-down fibers, and wet suede fibers are more likely to stick together and matte. If your shoes do ever get wet, blot them dry with a clean cloth or paper towel as soon as you can. Then, if possible, hold the shoes under an air dryer. If you can\u2019t do that, set them near a radiator or in a warm area to help them dry."
