If your hair gets oily after one day, wash and use a sea salt spray. Detangle your hair. Start brushing or combing the ends of your hair first. Gradually work your way up until your hair is completely smooth. For thick hair or especially stubborn knots, use a spray-on detangler. Add (or decrease) volume. Side buns need the right amount of volume to look good. Thin buns will fall out quickly. Thick buns could end up protruding too much. To manage these issues you could:\nTreat fine, limp hair, by curling it before you begin. Then, scrunch it with a small amount of mousse or gel. Just don\u2019t let it get \"crunchy.\" Treat thick, curly hair by applying an anti-frizz serum from the ears down to the ends. Create a deep part in your hair. Comb most of your hair on the side where you want your bun. Using the comb, draw a line through your hair. You can use hairspray sparingly to hold the part in place. Move the hair that pops up on to the appropriate side. Back comb your hair. Do this only to the roots at the back of your head. It will give your hair a bit more lift. Be careful not to create tangles. This step is optional, especially if your hair is thick or frizzy. Gather your hair at the base of your head. As you do this, brush out your hair to smooth out any bumps that might form. Tie your hair in place with an elastic hair band. This will help the bun stay in position. Bring down a few wisps. If you'd like to have a few pieces of hair hanging down around the ears, pull those out now. Use the wisps to frame your face in front of your ears.

If you don\u2019t want your hair to hang over your face, pin it to the side of your head with a bobby pin or discreet barrette. Making a Casual Side Bun Gather a small section of hair. Hold the hair between your thumb and your forefinger. Don\u2019t gather any more hair than these two fingers can hold at one time. Back comb your hair. Hold the section of your hair outward with one hand. Use a comb to tease your hair toward your head. If you\u2019re concerned about split ends, use the thumb and forefinger of your dominant hand to slide your hair toward your head. If back combing isn\u2019t for you, try twisting each section of hair for this step. Bunch up the back combed hair. Hold this section to your head. Insert a bobby pin to keep it in place. Whenever possible, hook the bobby pin onto the elastic inside the bun. Repeat. Continue the above steps until you\u2019re finished. Make sure the bun hangs to one side of your neck. Secure the bun. Add extra bobby pins to secure stray locks. Secure the bun in place with some hairspray. If some sections of hair come loose, curl them and re-pin them against the bun for a textured effect. Making a Formal Side Chignon Divide your ponytail into two sections. Brush or comb each section to remove any stubborn tangles. Drape the front section over your shoulder. Take the other section in your hand. Braid each section. Hold the hair at a diagonal angle. Create a traditional, three-part braid. Continue weaving until you reach the end. Secure the end with a thin elastic band. Loosen each braid. Position you thumb over the braid. Push each part of outward and upward. This will widen the braid and create texture. Pin up each braid. Roll the braid toward the elastic band at the base of your head. Make sure your hair is loose as you do this. Use a bobby pin to hold the braid in place. Place the braids right next to each other so that they look like one woven mass. Secure the chignon. Use bobby pins to fasten the chignon to your head. The number of bobby pins needed varies from person to person. Spritz with hairspray for extra hold. Pin any remaining wisps. Gather any strands hanging around your face. Pin them to the base of the chignon. Try to hide the ends in the chignon. This step is optional if you would prefer to leave a tress at the side of your face. Making a Loose Side Bun Twist the ponytail. Start at the base your head. Continue in a downward motion. As you twist your hair, let it roll into a spiral. Keep twisting the hair, allowing it to wind around the upper sections of the ponytail. Fasten the bun. Use an elastic band. Fasten the bottom portion of the bun to the beginning of the ponytail. Your hair should look like a complex spiral hanging from the side of your head. There will be tufts of hair poking out. Secure the bun. Pin long stands of hair sticking out to the base of your head. Bobby pins work best for this. Use additional bobby pins to fasten the sides of the bun to your head, as well. Spray with hairspray for a long-lasting hold.
