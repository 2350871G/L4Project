                    "description": "If you can, pick a dye that's within 1-2 shades of your natural color. To ensure you get the best hair color for gray hair, choose one that's specifically formulated and labeled for use on stubborn grays. If you're in doubt about which color to choose, go with one that's a little darker than your hair, since your roots are normally a little darker than the rest of your hair anyway. Consider the undertones of your hair, as well. For instance, if your hair is a rich, warm brunette, you might pick a color with warm chestnut tones. If your hair is a cool, dark blonde, you might opt for a dye with more of an ash undertone. If your hair is thick or coarse, a foam dye might give you more even coverage than a cream formula. However, if your hair is fine or thin, consider using a cream dye, as you'll be able to apply it more precisely."

                    "description": "You can purchase a brush wherever beauty or craft supplies are sold. A foam brush will work best if you're using a foam formula, while a synthetic bristle brush is best if you're using a cream dye. Look for a brush that's flat and about 2 in (5.1 cm) wide. Using a brush gives you more precision when you're applying the dye, so it's perfect when you want to touch up roots without ruining highlights."

That's because the natural oils from your scalp will help protect your skin and hair during the chemical process. During this time, avoid using styling products like hairspray, dry shampoo, or gel to ensure there's no buildup that will prevent the color from spreading evenly."

Wear old clothing, and if you can, opt for a button-down top so you don't have to pull your shirt over your head when it's time to rinse your hair. Also, wear plastic or rubber gloves to protect your hands from dye stains. To prevent staining on your face, spread a thin layer of petroleum on your skin around your hairline. Large spills can soak through towels, so if you want even more protection for your floors, consider spreading trash bags or another waterproof material instead of towels."

Continue parting your hair and brushing on dye until all of your gray roots are covered. If your hair was already colored, don't overlap the new dye with the previous color. Also, avoid applying the dye directly to your scalp. If you'd like, you can apply the color all over your roots. However, if you only have a few grays and you carefully matched your natural color, you can just brush the dye onto the gray areas, if you prefer."

If your kit doesn't have a conditioner, apply a thick layer of your regular conditioner to your hair. After 3-5 minutes, rinse your hair thoroughly. Avoid shampooing your hair for at least 48 hours after you color your hair. This will allow some of the natural oils to build back up on your scalp."
