Here are some options you may find on portable bandsaws:\nCapacity. Since the stock or material you are cutting must fit in the throat of the machine, choosing one with sufficient capacity is essential. Large capacity portable bandsaws can cut pipe or angle stock up to about 6 inches (15.2 cm), whereas standard machines are limited to about 4 inches (10.2 cm) of diameter or width. Power source. If you are working in the field where electrical cords are not practical, you may choose to purchase a battery powered saw. These, however, are more expensive than the typical A.C. voltage saws, and have limited cutting times between battery recharging. Brand choice. Most name-brands offer similar features and torque, and use a common blade length. Common brands include Porter Cable, Milwaukee, Ridgid, and DeWalt, and are available at builder's supply centers and tool retailers. Discount retailers offer off-brand tools which serve the same purpose, but may be of lower quality than the previous brands, at much lower prices. Be aware that with power tools, as with many consumer products, you will probably get what you pay for."
