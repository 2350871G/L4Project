                    "description": "When you're first learning to play the guitar, it's important to practice in a seated position. Before you can duck walk across the stage while ripping a solo, you've got to learn to hold the guitar comfortably, without having to struggle to reach the frets and the strings. The best way to do this is to learn to hold the guitar from a seated position in an appropriate chair. The best practice chairs are hard-backed chairs with no arm rests of any kind, or stools. Sit far forward on the chair, so your back isn't touching the back-rest, your butt right on the edge of the seat. Keep your back very straight. Guitar stools are available at most music stores, and they're perfect for practicing. They're also rather expensive. If you want one, go for it, but practicing in your own kitchen chair should be fine. Just avoid the couch, the La-Z-Boy, and other soft recliners, which will build bad posture and bad guitar habits."

If your acoustic comes with two pegs already, just attach the strap to both pegs at the top and bottom of the guitar body and you're set.

        "To strap an electric guitar, insert the pegs through the tabs on each end of the strap and you're should be ready to rock.",
        "Some straps will come with a variety of different tabs to allow for a variety of lengths.",
        "Start tight and loosen up if necessary.",
        "Adjust the guitar strap.",
        "Most straps can be adjusted by sliding the buckle up or down the length of the strap to make it longer or shorter.",
        "Sling the strap over the shoulder of your fretting hand and feel where the guitar falls.",
        "If it feels comfortable, you're all set.",
        "If not, remove the guitar and adjust the strap until it feels right.",
        "Ideally, you want the bottom of the guitar to be about even with your hip on your dominant side.",
        "Err on the side of keeping the strap short.",
        "You don\u2019t want to have the guitar too low or you\u2019ll struggle to play with your strumming hand.",
        "Likewise, if the guitar is too high, it can be tiring to hold your arms up that high to play.",
        "The length of the guitar strap will have a lot to do with your playing style.",
        "Some players want the guitar as high as possible to allow easy access to the fretboard, while rockers want the guitar as low as possible, because it looks awesome.",
        "There's no right way.",
        "Reinforce the guitar strap.",
        "The best guitar strap assemblies will come with a strap-enforcement peg or clip on the base of the guitar, which will help to hold the strap onto the guitar.",
        "There\u2019s nothing worse than a guitar that slips off the strap pegs and falls to the ground in the middle of a performance.",
        "These are usually simple plastic clips that will fit over the peg and keep the end of the strap from slipping off.",
        "Loop your guitar cable through the strap before plugging in.",
        "If you're plugging in, a good trick of the trade is to loop your guitar cable through the strap to keep it out of your way.",
        "Insert the cable between the base peg and the strap, from the back to the front of the guitar and plug it in.",
        "This is especially useful if you've got an input jack on the bottom of your guitar and it gets loose over time.",
        "You can keep the cable from slipping out and falling all the way to the ground."
