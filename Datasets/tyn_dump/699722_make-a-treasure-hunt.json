Choose the number of clues according to how much time you have and how many players are participating. Try to make the clues stick to the theme of your treasure hunt. If you are making a dinosaur treasure hunt, relate each clue to a different dinosaur. An example of a riddle is, \u201cI have a face that never frowns, hands that do not wave, no mouth but a familiar sound. I can\u2019t walk but I move around.\u201d\nAn example of clue sequence would be: Clue #1: When your hunger strikes your mood, it leads you here to get some food. (Place Clue #2 in the pantry.)
