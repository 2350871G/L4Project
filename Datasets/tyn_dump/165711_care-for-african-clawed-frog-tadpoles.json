                    "description": "A female frog can lay anywhere from 500 to 1,000 eggs and the rate of survival depends on the conditions of the tank. The most important factor is to keep the adults separate from the eggs. Otherwise, the tadpole eggs are in danger of being eaten by the adults. After you notice the first egg, watch out for more to follow in the next 2-4 days. There\u2019s a good chance the eggs will hatch at night, so check the tank every morning. Dedicate one tank to the eggs. The tank should be fairly wide but not overly tall. A good tank size is anywhere from 6-10 gallons with a water level of 7-12 inches deep. Keep the water temperature a bit higher for tadpoles at around 75 degrees fahrenheit. Once the tadpoles are older, they can be kept in water that is slightly cooler at 70 degrees fahrenheit. You can purchase an aquarium heater from a local pet store, to heat the water. Just be sure to have a thermometer in the water so that you can monitor the temperature. This is also the point where you need to decide how many frogs you'd ultimately like to raise, as most of the tadpoles will reach maturity so long as the environment is suitable."
