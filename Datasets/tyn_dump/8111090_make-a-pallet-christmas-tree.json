        "After your tree is sanded, you can stain and seal the wood, or you can paint it.",
        "Before painting, wipe the wood clean with a water dampened rag, allow the dampness to dry, then:\nOpen a can of suitable wood primer.",
        "Mix it according to its directions.",
        "Then use long, smooth strokes with a clean paintbrush to apply several layers to the front of the tree from the top to its bottom.",
        "Allow the primer to dry.",
        "Then open a can of suitable wood paint and mix it with a paint stirrer.",

        "These can be attached to your tree with a suitable glue or tape.",
        "You can create the effect of snow on the branches of your pallet tree by dipping a sponge into a little bit of white paint and lightly stippling them.",
        "If you want to draw a design on your tree but lack the artistic skill to freehand it, you can always make a stencil and use that to apply the design.",
        "String up lights, if desired.",
        "For many Christmas celebrating cultures, a Christmas tree is not complete without a strand of lights circling around it.",
        "Take a string of lights and wrap it around the branches of your tree until it is completely strung.",

        "U-shaped tacks or sturdy tape, like duct tape, are useful for holding lights in place.",
        "To give your tree the most polished and authentic look, you may want to hide the front and back end of your string of lights behind the tree.",
        "Mark leftover 2x4s to make a stand, if desired.",
        "You should have two leftover 2x4 boards that you removed from the pallet when cutting the shape of your tree.",
        "Take these and use your hammer or pry bar to remove nails and any attached pieces of wood, then:\nMeasure and mark one long edge of each 2x4 board at its halfway point.",
        "An inch (2.54 cm) to either side of your halfway marks, measure and mark a line that extends from long edge to long edge.",
        "Lay each board so they are standing upright on their long edge, with your halfway mark oriented upwards.",
        "Measure and mark the halfway point between the opposing long edges of the 2x4s.",

        "Cut the 2x4s and assemble the tree stand.",
        "Use your saw to cut the 2x4s at the lines extending between the long sides of the 2x4.",
        "The deepness of your notch should not surpass the halfway point you marked between the opposing long edges of each 2x4.",
        "Cutting deeper could result in a weak joint between the boards of your stand.",
