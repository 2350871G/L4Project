The warmth will open the pores of your skin, making it somewhat easier to remove hair. Apply shaving cream, if desired. Many people prefer to use a shaving cream to make the shaving process easier and to reduce irritation. Follow the directions your cream supplies, but generally speaking you will only need to apply a thin, even coat. Unscented cream is best, because it lessens chances of irritation and allergic reaction. Carefully use the razor to remove hair from your underarms. Go slowly and carefully, as your underarms are curved and difficult to shave. You do not want to cut or nick your skin in the process. Shaving in the direction that the hair grows will reduce the chance of razor burn and ingrown hairs. Use a mild astringent afterwards. Apply a mild astringent, such as witch hazel, after shaving to reduce irritation. Exactly how often you will want to shave depends on how fast your hair grows, your personal preference, and other factors. Replace your razors regularly. It's time to get a new one when you see an accumulation of waste in the razor. This waste can introduce bacteria to your pores and cause an infection."
