        "If you see any bare spots, you can simply sprinkle more glitter over them.",
        "If you got any glitter outside of the tape, use a dry paintbrush to gently brush it off.",
        "Use a large brush for large areas, and a small brush for tight corners and curves.",

        "You can stop here, or you can lay down additional strips of tape to add more colors of glitter to your item.",

        "This method is not as durable as using decoupage glue, so expect there to be some shedding.",

        "Brush or spray on 1 to 2 thin coats of sealer.",
