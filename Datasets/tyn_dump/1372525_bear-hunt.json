                    "description": "The easiest and most accessible bear species to hunt is the black bear, especially if you\u2019re a beginner. Brown bears and grizzly bears tend to be larger and more dangerous than black bears, so you should only hunt these species if you\u2019re a relatively experienced hunter. The best areas to hunt most bears are in wooded coastal areas, since this is where they tend to live. However, they usually can also be found in most large forests. The only exception is polar bears, which have to be hunted in the Arctic. If you don\u2019t have experience distinguishing between bear species, try to go hunting with someone who does. Black bears have a flat nose, no visible shoulder hump, relatively large ears, and small claws. Grizzly bears have a pronounced shoulder hump, small ears, and much larger claws than a black bear."

                    "description": "Bears are strong, powerful predators, so use a relatively powerful weapon to ensure that the bear won\u2019t be able to attack you after you shoot it. Common bear hunting weapons include muzzle-loaders, rifles, and bow and arrows. Rifles are the most popular weapon for hunting bears since they fire high-velocity bullets that can kill a bear faster than an arrow or black powder ball can. Go with the most powerful caliber rifle that you\u2019re able to accurately shoot with. You\u2019ll want to be able to put as much power as possible behind your bullets without sacrificing your ability to shoot well. For maximum safety, use a rifle that can be reloaded and fired again relatively quickly. This way, if your first shot doesn\u2019t kill the bear, you\u2019ll be able to fire a second shot before the bear can get to you. Be sure to practice shooting with your weapon before you go out on your hunt to make sure you\u2019re able to use it effectively."

        "This will ensure that the bear\u2019s distinguishing facial features are able to be effectively preserved.",
        "Salt the hide in order to dehydrate and preserve it.",
        "Most bear hides will require about 20 pounds (9.1 kg) of salt in order to be sufficiently dehydrated.",
        "Apply the salt liberally to the inside of the hide, in the ears and nose, on the lips, and between the feet.",
        "The general rule of thumb is to apply 1 pound (0.45 kg) of salt per 1 pound (0.45 kg) of hide.",
        "For the purposes of preserving a hide, any type of salt will work.",
        "However, most hunters choose to use non-iodized, fine grained salt.",
        "Pack the hide and hang it in a cool, dry place for about 5 days.",
        "Pack the hide in a burlap or game bag in order to transport it out of the woods.",
        "Then, leave it hanging somewhere out of the sun and dry for about 5-7 days in order for it to fully dry out.",
        "After this much time, take your hide to a taxidermist in order to be preserved.",
        "Avoid packing the hide in a plastic bag; the plastic may rip the hair away from it."
