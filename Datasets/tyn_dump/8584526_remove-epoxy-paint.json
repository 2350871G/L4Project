                    "description": "Since epoxy paint is strong and resistant to wear and tear, removing it with a typical paint thinner will not work. Working with a stripper that contains methylene chloride, also called dichloromethane, will work best for removing epoxy paint. These can be found at home improvement stores, industrial suppliers, and various online retailers. Methylene chloride is a carcinogen and can cause respiratory, eye, and skin irritations. In addition, exposure to high concentrations can cause dizziness, confusion, headache, nausea, and even unconsciousness and death. It is important to follow the safety measures and instructions provided with the product."

They typically take longer to remove paint than methylene chloride strippers, but they carry fewer health risks. If the surface you are working with has several, thick layers of epoxy paint, consider using a caustic stripper. Caustic strippers should not be used to remove epoxy paint on wood since they can break down the fibers in the wood and attract moisture."

Soak a small plastic object in a plastic container that is filled with acetone. While wearing gloves, use a washcloth that is soaked with acetone to rub away paint after soaking. Acetone is highly flammable. Be sure to use this product in a safe environment away from an open flame. Purchase acetone online or at your local home improvement store."

        "Use the steel shot-blast method to remove epoxy.",
        "Shot blasting can help remove epoxy paint from a concrete floor, and it can help prep the surface if you are planning to repaint it.",
        "This method removes the paint by chipping it away using tiny steel balls that rebound off the floor at high pressure.",
        "The grooves and surface texture that this leaves behind can be polished afterward.",
        "Home restoration professionals and industrial flooring companies offer these services.",
        "You can also rent these devices at home restoration and hardware stores.",
        "Consider sand-blasting.",
        "Sand-blasting is another form of abrasive blasting that can help remove epoxy on concrete or hardwood floors.",

        "You can rent portable sand-blasting equipment at your local hardware store, or you can hire a home improvement professional.",
        "Proceed with caution.",
        "With any blast-removal method, it is important to wear protective earmuffs while working as these machines can produce a lot of noise.",

        "Vacuum the particles.",
        "Remove the dust and particles from the surface after blasting by using a wet-dry vacuum.",
        "These can be purchased at home improvement stores and range between $30 to $130.",
        "Check for white residue.",
        "After vacuuming, run your finger along the floor.",
        "If you lift up white residue, then the vacuum did not clean the surface entirely.",
        "Vacuum the surface again or pressure wash the floor to thorough clean the surface.",
        "If there is a large amount of white residue, mix \u00bd cup of trisodium phosphate, or TSP, with two gallons of water.",
        "TSP is a cleaning agent that can be purchased at hardware stores.",
        "Gently scrub the floor with the mixture, or use a push broom to move the mixture along the surface.",
