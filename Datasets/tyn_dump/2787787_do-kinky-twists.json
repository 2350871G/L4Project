        "You can also use another type of gel; the purpose of this is to smooth away frizz and create extra hold.",
        "Don\u2019t use moisturizing cream yet, however; you\u2019ll apply that later.",
        "Take it easy on the gel; a little bit goes a long way.",
        "While you want to be generous with moisturizing cream, you only need a small dab of gel.",
        "Center the Marley hair against the split hair section.",
        "Find the middle of the Marley hair and set it over the 1 in (2.5 cm) hair section.",
        "Add the left half of the Marley hair to the left section, and the right half to the right section.",
        "You\u2019ll end up with 2 thick strands.",
        "Treat your left section, including the Marley hair, as 1 strand.",
        "Treat the right section (including the Marley hair) as a second strand.",
        "Twist each strand into ropes while applying moisturizing cream to them.",
        "Apply some moisturizing cream to the left strand, and twist it into a rope.",
        "Hold it in your left half, then repeat the process for the right section with your right hand.",
        "You\u2019ll be repeating this step a lot, so you only need to apply the moisturizer to just a few inches/centimeters of hair.",
        "Make sure that you twist both strands in the same direction.",
        "This can be clockwise or counterclockwise.",
        "Keep the twists tight so that you get 2 ropes, but don\u2019t twist them so that that they hurt.",
        "Twist the ropes together in the opposite direction.",
        "This is just like making a rope braid.",
        "Recall the direction you twisted your hair in to create the ropes: clockwise or counterclockwise.",
        "Next, twist the 2 ropes together in the opposite direction to make a single rope.",
        "For example, if you twisted your hair counterclockwise to create 2 ropes, you should twist the ropes clockwise to create 1 thick rope.",
        "Repeat the process until you reach the end of the Marley hair.",
        "Apply some more moisturizing cream to a couple inches/centimeters of hair.",
        "This time, give each strand a single, tight twist before twisting them together.",
        "Keep going until you have no more Marley hair to braid.",
        "If the Marley hair is longer than your desired length, simple stop twisting when the rope braid is close to the length you want it to be.",
        "After you let go of a finished twist, it will likely spring back a little and feel somewhat loose.",
        "This shouldn\u2019t be a problem, though.",
        "The twist is still thick enough to stay in place.",
        "Finishing the Twists Trim off excess Marley hair with scissors or a razor, if needed.",
        "Scissors will be safer, but they will result in a blunt cut, which won\u2019t look very natural.",
        "A razor will give you a nice, natural-looking taper, but you\u2019ll have to be careful not to nick your fingers!",
        "The Marley twist may come undone slightly.",
        "If this happens, simply find the 2 strands and twist them back into a rope.",
        "If you are using scissors, consider cutting at a downward angle instead.",
        "Dip the end into boiling water to seal it.",
        "Boil some water first, then take it off the stove.",
        "Dip the end of your braid into the water for a few seconds, then lift it out.",
        "Avoid touching the wet hair with your fingers, as it will be very hot.",
        "Take the hot water off the stove before you dip the hair into it.",
        "You only need to dip it in by about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm).",
        "For an added twist, wrap a perm rod around the end of your hair before dipping it into the hot water.",
        "Let the hair dry before removing the rod.",
        "Repeat the entire process to make more twists.",
        "Go back to your large section and undo another 1 in (2.5 cm) section of hair.",
        "Split it in half and add 2 strands of Marley hair.",
        "Twist the hair into a rope braid, then trim the ends.",
        "Work 1 section at a time until you are done.",
        "This can take up to 16 hours.",
        "Consider enlisting a friend to help you.",
        "If you can\u2019t get a helping hand, take plenty of breaks.",
        "Cover your hair with a chic scarf to disguise the half-finished twists.",
        "Caring for Marley Twists Wash your twists with diluted shampoo.",
        "Get your hair wet in the shower first.",
        "Next, pour shampoo diluted with water over it, focusing on the scalp.",
        "Massage your scalp with your fingertips, then rinse your hair with water.",
        "Plan on using 8 parts water to 1 part shampoo.",
        "You can mix this ahead of time in a large bottle so that you have more for later.",
        "If this method makes the twists too heavy, use a spray bottle to apply the water and diluted shampoo instead.",
        "How often you wash your hair depends on how fast your scalp gets oily.",
        "In general, however, you shouldn\u2019t have to wash it more than once per week.",
        "Let your hair air dry when possible.",
        "Use a towel to gently squeeze the excess water from your hair first, then wrap your hair up in the towel for 1 to 2 hours.",
        "Remove the towel, then let your hair finish air drying on its own.",
        "If your twists aren't completely dry after a few hours, speed the process up with a hairdryer.",
        "This is important; if you don't, they may develop mold!",
        "Moisturize your scalp and twists 2 to 3 times per week.",
        "How often you end up doing this really depends on how dry or oily your scalp gets.",
        "The more dry your scalp gets, the more often you should moisturize it.",
        "You can use a hair moisturizing cream or hair oil to do this.",
        "Use natural products, such as olive oil or shea butter on your scalp.",
        "Massage them in with your fingertips.",
        "You can use natural or store-bought products from the salon on the twists themselves.",
        "Smooth down frizz with diluted leave-in conditioner.",
        "Like with the shampoo, use about 8 parts water to 1 part leave-in conditioner.",
        "Spray the solution onto your twists after you get out of the shower.",
        "You only need to do this once per week.",
        "If you do it more than that, you may get build-up.",
        "Cover your twists with a silk scarf and bonnet when sleeping.",
        "If your twists are especially long, you can put them into a loose ponytail first.",
        "Wrap a silk scarf around your head to cover all your hair, then put on a bonnet.",
        "The bonnet is not absolutely necessary, but it will help keep the silk scarf in place as you sleep.",
        "Don't twist the hair elastic too many times, or you may get dents in your hair.",
        "The goal here is just to gather your twists into 1 bunch."
