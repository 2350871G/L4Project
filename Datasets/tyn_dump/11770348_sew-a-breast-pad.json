Since no one will see the breast pads, choose a bright, fun, or bold print if you want to give the pads a little style. 1 yard (0.91 m) of fabric is enough to make 14 pads or 7 pairs. For a more natural option, use a layer of wool fabric instead of PUL. Keep in mind that wool is thicker than PUL so the pads will be bulkier."

You can use 1 to 3 layers in each pad depending on how absorbent you want them to be. Then, buy 1 yard (0.91 m) of fabric for each absorbent layer. These are some great absorbent fabric choices:Tip: Avoid using cotton or fleece batting since it's not as absorbent and will degrade quickly after washing. The batting also traps heat and makes the pads bulky. Terry: This cotton fabric made of loops is soft, inexpensive, and highly absorbent. Microfiber: It's a polyester fabric that's lightweight and inexpensive, but it can compress over time. Flannel or jersey: Both of these cotton fabrics are soft, and durable although they don't absorb as quickly as terry or microfiber. Hemp: Although it's more expensive than other absorbent fabrics, it's durable and the most absorbent option."

The fabric also has to wick away moisture to the absorbent layers. Velour fabric is another great option because it's made from cotton or bamboo and is incredibly soft."

Find a CD that you don't mind getting fingerprints or scratches on. If you don't have an old CD, cut out a cardboard circle that's about 5 inches (13 cm) across.
