        "The simplest, most direct way to kill a wasp is to smack it with a flyswatter.",
        "Wait until the wasp lands on a surface to rest.",
        "Swat it when it's motionless and continue to do so until it's dead.",
        "Only use a swatter if you are trying to get rid of one wasp or a small group in a concentrated area.",
        "Don't attempt to swat wasps if you have slow reflexes or haven't practiced swatting, as you are likely to get stung when the wasp flies away and tries to defend itself.",
        "Suck the wasps up using a powerful lightweight vacuum.",
        "Turn on the vacuum and place it about 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) from the wasps.",
        "After you have vacuumed all the wasps, suck up 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of cornstarch to incapacitate them.",
        "Open the vacuum canister while it is still running, tape the opening of the bag, and then turn the vacuum off.",
        "Remove the bag and put it in a freezer overnight before throwing it away.",
        "Choose a vacuum that has a removable bag.",
        "Vacuum wasps as spring arrives, right when they start coming out of hibernation.",
        "They tend to be slow and sluggish, making it easier to catch them and sweep them away.",
        "Hide appealing food sources.",
        "Flowers, food, and drinks can all attract wasps.",
        "Move flowers to the far side of your yard and be sure to clean up all food and drinks.",
        "At the end of the summer, wasps are most attracted to sugary drinks and foods.",
        "At the beginning and middle of the summer, they are more drawn to meat.",
        "Cover your food with resealable silicone lids, and avoid plastic and cling film.",
        "Move potted flowers away from your house and avoid using sweet or floral perfumes, shampoos, lotions, or soaps.",
        "Do not let food linger outside, especially in the heat.",
        "Baiting and Trapping Wasps Hang a lure trap along your property line within \u20444 mile (0.40 km) of wasps.",
        "Hang a commercially-bought lure trap in an area the wasps frequent.",
        "Be sure to place it along your property line as far away from patios and protected areas as possible.",
        "Check every few days and replace it as needed once the trap begins to fill or after the time designated on the instructions.",
        "Lure traps can be purchased from department stores, big-box stores, and online suppliers.",
        "Create a water trap using a 0.528 gallon (2.00 L) plastic bottle.",
        "Cut the neck off the plastic bottle.",
        "Remove the cap, turn the neck upside-down, and let it rest inside the opening.",
        "Place duct tape or packing tape horizontally along the connection point between the 2 bottle pieces.",
        "Afterward, fill the bottle with sugar water, soda, or pieces of meat and other protein.",
        "Hang it by taping strings to it or screwing a hole into it to affix it into wood.",
        "Wipe a layer of cooking oil around the edges of the trap so that it becomes too slippery for the wasps to stand on.",
        "Before emptying the trap, freeze it or pour boiling water into it to kill any remaining living wasps.",
        "Attach a bait station onto a close by post or tree trunk.",
        "A bait station is an enclosed trap that lures wandering wasps inside, at which point the wasps are killed with a chemical insecticide.",
        "Align button head self-tapping screws into the openings of each bait station.",
        "Place them against a tree or post near a wasps nest.",
        "Afterward, hammer the screws through the holes to affix them to the selected surface.",
        "Bait stations can be purchased form big-box stores or online suppliers.",
        "Set glue traps near wasp nests and entryways to the nests.",
        "Hang glue traps near wasp nests along clotheslines using clothespins.",
        "Glue traps can also be placed on flat surfaces in areas that wasps frequently crawl around.",
        "Use glue traps during the early stages of nest development, when the wasp population is smaller at this point and more easily controlled.",
        "Purchase glue traps from big-box stores and online suppliers.",
        "Make a drinking station bait with water and pyrethroid powder.",
        "Place a plant pot into a tray and fill the tray up with water.",
        "Put the pot in a sunny position and the wasps will eventually learn to drink there.",
        "Add a powder containing a pyrethroid such as permethrin (a natural product extracted from chrysanthemums).",
        "Mix the powder to a paste and stir water into it.",
        "Use drinking stations early in the summer for best results.",
        "Keep adding fresh water every 1 to 2 days to attract more wasps, and repeat the whole process every 3 to 5 days.",
        "Getting Rid of Nests Hang a fake nest within 200 feet (61 m) of each new nest.",
        "Early on in the summer, you might be able to chase wasps away at their first appearance by hanging a fake nest around your home or around any area you want wasps to stay away from.",
        "However, this solution isn't always effective and doesn't work late in the summer.",
        "Purchase fake wasp nests from big-box stores and online suppliers.",
        "You can also use a paper lantern or brown paper bag.",
        "Knock the nest down after applying insecticide or early in the season.",
        "If you have applied insecticide or the season is early and the nest is still small, consider knocking the it down with a broom, rake, or other long-handled tools.",
        "When the wasps are alive, you must knock the nest down on a regular basis to discourage the wasps.",
        "Expect to knock the nest down several times before the wasps give up and find somewhere else to build.",
        "If you have applied in insecticide and most of the wasps are dead, saturate it with insecticide spray after knocking it down and then break it apart.",
        "Drown underground nests with boiling water at night.",
        "Keep an eye on wasp behavior for 2 to 3 days and find the most frequented nest entrances and exits.",
        "Afterward, head over to these spots at night when the wasps are asleep and pour a pot of boiling water down.",
        "Stuff some soil into the holes after you have flooded the hive (unless the wasps begin to ascend from the nest).Always wear protection and be careful\u2014this method can trigger a mass attack.",
        "Capture and seal the nest in the fall.",
        "Wait until the coolest time of night and approach the nest as quietly as possible.",
        "Quickly slip a plastic bag over the nest while continuing to make as little noise as possible.",
        "Afterward, close the bag around the limb directly above the nest, tie the bag shut, and then cut or break the limb from the tree.",
        "Place the nest into the freezer for about a day or into a bucket of water to drown the wasps.",
        "Only attempt to capture wasps in late October or after the first hard freeze, which is at least 4 hours in a row of air temperatures lower than 25 \u00b0F (\u22124 \u00b0C).",
        "Make sure the plastic has an airtight seal."
