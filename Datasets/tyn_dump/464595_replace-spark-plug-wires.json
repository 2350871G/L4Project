You must be aware of the length of the wire you are replacing compared to the old wires on your engine. Try to stay as close as possible to the old wire length. Different makers have different lengths, and replacement wires are often sold longer than the originals. This allows them to sell more assemblies of wires to fit more applications, so you may have slight differences. Check the length before you start, and it'll be okay. Quality is important. Stay away from most of the \"make your own length\" kits unless they are high quality and you are very comfortable installing your own boots. Oftentimes, the manufactures do not allow repairs on their wires. Don't start cutting the wires to a certain length unless you know for certain that new ends can be safely put on the wires you cut. Otherwise, you may regret it! Some spark plug wires can be purchased individually from some auto parts stores fully assembled."

Running from a coil to the wrong plug will prevent the engine from running, which could lead to damage. Keep the wires away from exhaust components that might damage them, and keep each wire from crossing over another wire. Spark plug wires usually rest in wire looms or standoffs. A wire resting on the engine or a wire crossing another can short or leak or break down due to heat. Thus, make sure to rout the replacements properly through the loom, well away from resting on any metal. If replacing wires with a high performance coil and kit, be aware existing looms may not fit.
