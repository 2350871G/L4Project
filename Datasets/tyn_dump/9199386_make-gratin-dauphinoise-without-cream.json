Set the temperature to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C), and allow it to fully heat. Rub the garlic clove over a shallow baking dish. For the gratin, you\u2019ll need a fairly shallow baking dish. Use a clove of peeled garlic to rub down the interior of the dish. This helps season the dish so the gratin has an extra level of flavor. A ceramic pie or tart dish works best for making the gratin. You can discard the garlic clove after you\u2019ve rubbed down the baking dish or save it for another recipe. Mist the dish with olive oil spray.
