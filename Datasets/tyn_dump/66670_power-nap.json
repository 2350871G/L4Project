If your place of employment isn't nap-friendly, you can take a power-nap in your car. Napping on the road: If you're driving, find a rest area to park in. Don't park on the shoulder. Always turn off the car and set the emergency brake. If it's night-time, park in a well-lit area with plenty of people around and lock all of your doors. Napping at school: If you have the time, and are allowed to,try using the library as a good place to nap. It is usually the quietest place at school.

        "Taking a \u201ccaffeine nap\u201d in which 200mg of caffeine are consumed right before a 20 minute nap may improve performance and make you feel less sleepy once you wake up.",
        "However, if it is late in the afternoon you should probably skip the caffeine, as it may make it more difficult to fall asleep at bedtime.",
        "You can also skip the caffeine if you are trying to quit caffeine.",
        "Set an alarm.",
        "Once you are close to finishing your coffee (or your green tea, or your caffeine jello shot, etc.",
        "), set an alarm that will wake you up after the desired amount of time.",
        "Setting an alarm will help you relax, as you know you won\u2019t sleep longer than you intend to.",
        "Keep in mind how long you need to fall asleep.",
        "If you want to take a 20 minute nap, and you usually take about five minutes to fall asleep, then you will want to set your alarm for 25 minutes.",
        "If you fall asleep very quickly, you may only need to add an extra minute or two to your desired nap time.",
        "If you're one of those people who has a habit of pressing the \"snooze\" button and going right back to sleep, put your alarm across the room, or as far away from yourself as possible if you\u2019re in the car, so that it will not be easy to turn it off.",
        "Close your eyes and relax.",
        "If you are consuming caffeine, you can do this directly after finishing your caffeine, if you are not, you can do this directly after you have made yourself comfortable and set your alarm.",
        "Try the \"4-7-8 exercise\" to fall asleep quickly.",
        "If you are having trouble falling asleep try this exercise: Close your eyes, and exhale completely.",
        "Then breathe in slowly, to a count of four.",
        "Hold your breath to a count of seven; then, making a whooshing sound, breath out through your mouth to a count of eight.",
        "Inhale one breath in, and then repeat the cycle three or four times.",
        "The whole exercise only takes about 60 seconds, and should help put you to sleep quickly.",
        "You can also try putting all thoughts out of your mind.",
        "Instead, try focusing only on your breathing.",
        "This is very similar to meditating, but can also help you relax so that you can fall asleep quickly.",
        "Try counting down slowly from 100.",
        "If you forget what number you're on, simply start again at 100.",
        "This will help keep your mind off of thoughts that keep you awake.",
        "You can also try one of the commercially available power nap machines or CDs that play a special soundtrack designed to induce a sleep state.",
        "Keep your eyes closed.",
        "Even if you are unable to fall asleep during your nap, keep your eyes closed and meditate.",
        "Although you may not fall asleep, you can still help your brain recharge a bit.",
        "Additionally, incorporating short bouts of sleep into a daily routine (taking a nap every day after lunch, for example) can help you \"train\" your body to expect a nap during that time and you'll have an easier time falling asleep.",
        "Get up as soon as the alarm goes off.",
        "Resist the temptation to sleep longer.",
        "Ideally, you will wake up feeling refreshed, but you may sometimes feel like you want to sleep more; do your best to resist this temptation as it can throw off your sleep routine, and you may wake up the second time with sleep inertia.",
        "Follow up with physical activity.",
        "Get your heart rate up a bit by doing a few jumping jacks or push-ups, you can also try a bit of jogging in place.",
        "Wash your face and expose yourself to bright light (e.g.",
        "sunlight), which can help you feel more awake, if you are still feeling groggy after your nap."
