Focus on the thicker areas so that the chicken breasts are all the same thickness by the time you are done. Do not rinse the chicken beforehand; you can, however, trim away any excess fat. If you don't have a meat mallet, you can use a rolling pin or a jar instead. If you don't have a large, plastic, zippered bag, you can use two sheets of plastic wrap. The plastic bags will do a better job at keeping the juices from splattering everywhere, however. You can use bone-in chicken breasts for this recipe, but they will take longer to cook. If you are using bone-in chicken breasts, you do not need to pound them. Consider brining boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Fill a large bowl with 1 quart (1 liter) of water. Stir in 1/4 cup (cc grams) of salt, then add 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Leave the chicken in the brine for 15 minutes, then take them out. Rinse the brine off with cold water, and pat the chicken breasts dry with paper towels. For a more intense brine, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and leave it in the fridge for up to 6 hours. Brining chicken breasts is not completely necessary, but it will make the chicken breasts more juicy and flavorful. Preheat your oven to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C). Make sure that the baking rack is in the middle of the oven. Arrange the chicken breasts in a large baking dish. Leave some space between each breast. If they are too close together, they won't cook evenly. They will also steam, and you won't get that nice, crispy layer on top. Brush both sides of each breast with olive oil, then rub both sides with your seasoning. You can use the seasonings listed in the recipe, of you can use your own. If you are using a mix of seasonings, like the one in the recipe, mix them together in a small bowl first. Bake the chicken for 15 to 18 minutes, or until a cooking thermometer reads 170\u00b0F (77\u00b0C). Unlike beef, chicken cannot be pink inside or under-cooked. After 15 to 18 minutes, open the oven, and stick a cooking thermometer into the thickest part of the chicken. If it reads 170\u00b0F (77\u00b0C), it is ready. Bone-in chicken breasts will take about 15 minutes longer to bake. Be careful not to touch the bone when inserting the thermometer. If the temperature does not read 170\u00b0F (77\u00b0C), even after 18 minutes of baking, then keep cooking the chicken until it does. If you want the chicken to be browned and crispy, turn the broiler onto high during the last 3 to 5 minutes of cooking. Take the chicken out of the oven, and let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes. This will allow all the juices to settle, and make your chicken tender and moist. Keep the pan covered with aluminum foil while the meat is resting so that it doesn't cool or dry off. Grilling Chicken Breasts Place the chicken breasts into a plastic, zippered bag and pound it with a meat mallet until it is \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) thick. This helps even out the chicken breasts so that they cook more evenly. If you don't own a meat mallet, you can use a rolling pin or heavy jar instead.

Saut\u00e9ing Chicken Breasts Place the chicken breasts into a plastic, zippered bag, then pound them flat with meat mallet. The chicken breasts need to be about \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) thick. Focus on the thicker parts of the chicken breast first; you want the breasts to be the same thickness all around. This will help them cook faster and more evenly. No meat mallet? No problem!

You can cut away any excess fat if you'd like, however. This method is not recommended for bone-in chicken. Season both sides of the chicken with salt and pepper. You can also use your own spices, seasonings, and rubs. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat until it starts to smoke a little. If you aren't using a nonstick skillet, lightly coat the skillet with about 2 to 3 teaspoons of cooking oil. Tilt the pan from side-to-side to help the oil spread across the entire surface. If you are using a nonstick skillet, then you don't need to coat it. Arrange the chicken in a single layer on the skillet. The skillet needs to be big enough to big enough to fit all of the chicken breasts in one layer with some space in between each breast. If the skillet is too small, the chicken will steam instead. Lower the heat to medium, then cook the chicken for 8 to 12 minutes, turning it occasionally using a spatula. It is ready when the inside is no longer pink, and the juices are clear.

You can also slice it up, and serve it on top of a salad, or use it in a sandwich. Poaching Chicken Breasts Arrange the chicken breasts in the bottom of a large saucepan. It's okay if the chicken breasts overlap, but they will cook more evenly if they don't. Skinless, boneless chicken is the best for this method, but you can use bone-in chicken as well. Do not wash the chicken breasts beforehand, as this will only spread bacteria. Any bacteria will be killed during the cooking process. Sprinkle some salt and pepper on top of the chicken, then add the lemon slices, fresh thyme, and rosemary. At this point, you can also add in some soy sauce for extra flavor. Cover the chicken with water. The water should be 1 to 1\u00bd inches (2.54 to 3.81 centimeters) above the chicken. How much water you use will depend on the size of your saucepan. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat, then let it simmer, covered, over low heat for about 10 to 15 minutes. The thicker the chicken breasts are, the longer they will cook. They are ready when the meat is no longer pink inside. If you are using bone-in chicken, it will need to cook for about 20 minutes. Take the chicken out of the saucepan and serve it. Use a pair of tongs so you don't burn yourself. You can serve the chicken as is, or you cut or shred the meat, and use it in your recipe. You can also discard the water, or strain it, and use it as a base for soups or sauces.",
