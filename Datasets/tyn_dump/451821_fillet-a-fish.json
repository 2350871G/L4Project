A fish that is caught but not bled out will be much messier on the cutting board and, in its final moments, the stress and struggle of death can make the meat taste acidic.

Remove the guts with your hands, wearing gloves, and use cold water to rinse out any left over insides. You should have a completely clean fish at this point, save for the skin. This can also be done with fresh fish at the body of water you caught it at, making it much easier to handle its guts and stomach contents. The smell of the guts can attract bears, eagles, and other fish-loving animals, though, so be aware of the wildlife in the area and take the necessary precautions, such as bringing a gun and having a place to retreat to. Gutting can be a nasty process, so be sure to have a trash bin nearby that you can throw them into if not at the riverside. Be sure to wipe down your counter afterwards, as the risk of cross-contamination is high when removing guts."
