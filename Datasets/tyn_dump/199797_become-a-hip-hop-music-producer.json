Listen to as many rappers and producers as you can, discovering what sounds you love and what style of music you want to make. The more you know about hip-hop, the better equipped you will be to make it. Hip-hop is one of the easiest genres to get into, thanks to the wide variety of free music available at mixtape websites like Datpiff, LiveMixtapes, and HotNewHipHop."

RZA and got famous digging through old soul albums, Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin made waves bringing rock & roll into rap, and Kanye uses a full classical orchestra behind many of his beats. There is no genre that you cannot find inspiration in as a hip-hop producer. Listen to music for its quality, not because of its genre or reputation. Keep notes of music you like so you can find it, and potentially use it, later."

These days, extra tools can plug right into your computer to give you even greater control over your music, however, and are nearly invaluable. Keyboards: Perhaps the second most important tool next to a computer, keyboards allow you to create your own melodies and physically play your beat, which is usually much faster than inputting the notes into the computer. Drum Machines: incredibly versatile rhythm instruments, drum machines let you assign any sound you want to a  small pad then play that sound as if it was a drum. You can program it with drums, cymbals, percussion instruments, notes, or even random sounds. Microphone: Essential if you want to record vocal tracks, microphones also let you record other instruments and sounds to incorporate into your beats. MIDI Controllers: Complex but powerful, MIDI controllers give you the ability to adjust tone, rhythm, loops, drums, and beats with the touch of a button. Many high-end keyboards and drum machines come with attached MIDI Controllers. Speakers: Be sure to invest in good speakers so you can hear your music at the highest possible quality, that way you can be sure your listeners are hearing what you want them to hear."

                    "description": "The drums are the most important part of your beat and form the structure to the entire song. Especially in hip-hop, where singers need a steady rhythm to rap over, you need to create a solid foundation for melody, vocals, and orchestration. Start with the classic trio of drum beats -- kick drum, snare, and hi-hat. Play with these three drums to produce the bouncy, up-tempo feel of classic rap and hip-hop songs. Ex. DJ Premier's famous beats on the album Step in the Arena. Download free drum packs online to find unique percussion and sounds the incorporate into your songs. Experiment with other sounds for percussion. Producers such as J Dilla (Ex. \"Waves\") became famous for using voices, sirens, pops, and other noises in place of drums.

A bass line gives your song a basic template for the melody\nBass lines can be a simple, like Nas' \"Memory Lane (Sittin' in the Park),\" or complex, like Common's \"Be (Intro).\" Practice meshing the bass line with your kick drum, as they both emit low frequency notes. Layer them so you can hear both, like in the songs above."

If you want an RnB inspired song, for example, you'll want piano, some horns, and maybe some jazzy guitar (Ex. Blues Scholars \"The Ave\"). If you want an epic, cinematic song you'll be adding strings, tubas, gongs, etc (Ex. Big Boi's \"General Patton\").

It allows you to create a consistent beat for the MC to rap over and keeps you from tediously writing out the same part over and over again. The best loops are seamless.

Sampling is one of the building blocks of hip-hop producing, but you should always do it with caution -- sampling without permission can be illegal. Use sample sparingly, finding 2-3 notes that you like and distorting them, repeating them, or chopping them up into something new."

For example, at a moment when the lyrics reference the police, it is common to put a siren sound in the song. When you hear particularly powerful lines or rhythms, considering muting the beat so that listeners can hear the rapper clearly, then jumping back in as a surprise. Build up the beat-- start the song with just drums and bass, and add an instrument each verse, then break it down in the outro (Ex. Outkast's \"Slump\")\nAdd subtle accents -- even noises that are hard to hear can give the song depth."

EQ: Also known as equalization, this is where you adjust the volume, frequency, and sounds of the entire song so that all the parts fit smoothly together. Effects: There are endless effects, all of which adjust or alter the sound of an instrument to make it fit the mood of the song. They can create echoes, change tones, subtly adjust notes, and much more. They are never permanent, so test them out on every instrument. Quantization: The art of taking hand-made notes or beats and electronically lining them  up with the beat.

        "Especially in hip-hop, where singers need a steady rhythm to rap over, you need to create a solid foundation for melody, vocals, and orchestration.",
        "Start with the classic trio of drum beats -- kick drum, snare, and hi-hat.",
        "Play with these three drums to produce the bouncy, up-tempo feel of classic rap and hip-hop songs.",

        "(Ex.",
        "50 Cent's \"Heat\" uses gun noises for percussion) Build in a bass line.",
        "Hip-hop has its roots in jazz, funk, and soul, and just like the genres that spawned it, all hip-hop tracks require two basic instruments: drums and bass.",
        "A bass line gives your song a basic template for the melody\nBass lines can be a simple, like Nas' \"Memory Lane (Sittin' in the Park),\" or complex, like Common's \"Be (Intro).\"",
        "Practice meshing the bass line with your kick drum, as they both emit low frequency notes.",
        "Layer them so you can hear both, like in the songs above.",
        "Add in orchestration and melody instruments.",
        "Once you've established the \"groove\" of the song with bass and drums, it's time to make it really shine.",
        "This is where you get to design the feel of a song.",
        "If you want an RnB inspired song, for example, you'll want piano, some horns, and maybe some jazzy guitar (Ex.",
        "Blues Scholars \"The Ave\").",

        "Big Boi's \"General Patton\").",
        "Play around with sounds constantly-- the only way to find out what sounds best is to try out as many different orchestrations as possible.",
        "Learn how to loop.",
        "Looping is when you take several bars of music and repeat throughout a song so it sounds like someone is playing the part the entire time.",

        "Learn how to sample.",
        "Sampling is when you splice bit of other songs into your song, using the old part to create something entirely new.",
        "Sampling is one of the building blocks of hip-hop producing, but you should always do it with caution -- sampling without permission can be illegal.",
        "Use sample sparingly, finding 2-3 notes that you like and distorting them, repeating them, or chopping them up into something new.",
        "Add the vocals.",
        "Whether you do them yourself or have someone else rapping, record the vocals to your song and tinker with the length, chorus placement, and any intros or outros you want.",
        "Finish the songs with accents, beat drops, and surprise.",
        "Use your producing skills to mesh the lyrics with the beat.",
        "For example, at a moment when the lyrics reference the police, it is common to put a siren sound in the song.",

        "Build up the beat-- start the song with just drums and bass, and add an instrument each verse, then break it down in the outro (Ex.",

        "Refine your beats.",
        "Read your software manual and learn about EQ, effects and quantization, and use them where necessary.",
        "EQ: Also known as equalization, this is where you adjust the volume, frequency, and sounds of the entire song so that all the parts fit smoothly together.",
        "Effects: There are endless effects, all of which adjust or alter the sound of an instrument to make it fit the mood of the song.",
        "They can create echoes, change tones, subtly adjust notes, and much more.",
        "They are never permanent, so test them out on every instrument.",
        "Quantization: The art of taking hand-made notes or beats and electronically lining them  up with the beat.",

        "Even if you only want to produce for fun, you'll find the only way to really become a hip-hop producer is to produce some hip-hop."
