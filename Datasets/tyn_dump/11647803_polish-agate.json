A toy tumbler won\u2019t have much effect on the rocks, and you probably don\u2019t need a commercial tumbler unless you\u2019re doing very large loads or plan on selling the rocks. Hobby-level tumblers are fine for most needs. Pick one up for $50-$300, depending on the size and model. Tumblers come in sizes ranging from 3 lb (1.4 kg) to over 20 lb (9.1 kg). Unless you have a large rock collection to polish, a smaller one is probably fine. You can buy tumblers online or at hobby stores. If you\u2019re only polishing a few rocks or don\u2019t plan on doing this again, then use a handheld polishing method. You may also be able to rent or borrow a tumbler for a one-time job."

You can place other rocks in the tumbler as well, but make sure they match the hardness of agate to avoid damaging them. Agate is a 7 on the hardness scale, so use other rocks that are a 7 like quartz and jasper. Different rock tumblers may have different instructions on how much to fill.

        "After washing the rocks thoroughly, put them back into the tumbler.",
        "This time, add the medium-grit carbide.",
        "Cover the rocks with water, then run the tumbler for 7 more days.",
        "When that's finished, remove, drain, and rinse the rocks again.",
        "Remember that since the rocks grind down with each step, they may not take up the same volume from one step to another.",
        "Add filler if you have to so the tumbler is always 3/4 of the way full.",
        "Complete the grinding with fine-grit carbide for 7 days.",
        "After running the tumbler with the medium-grit for a week, remove and rinse the rocks and tumbler.",
        "Put them back into the tumbler and add the fine-grit carbide and water.",
        "Run the tumbler at this stage for another 7 days, then take the rocks out and rinse them.",
        "For this step, you'll probably need some filler because the rocks will be smaller than before.",
        "Run the rock tumbler once more with polishing grit.",
        "The final tumbler stage is with the polishing carbide.",
        "Load the tumbler as you did before.",
        "Then, scoop in the instructed amount of polishing carbide.",
        "Run the tumbler for a final 7 days to finish polishing the agate.",
        "At this point, you\u2019ll probably need filler.",
        "The rocks have been ground down and won\u2019t take up as much space.",
        "They may also scratch each other without a bit of a buffer between them.",
        "Remove and rinse the agate after 7 days.",
        "The polishing course finishes off the job.",
        "Open the tumbler and drain the rocks out like you did before.",
        "Rinse each rock thoroughly and dry it with a clean towel.",
        "Enjoy your newly-polished stones!",
        "If the rocks still look a little dull after rinsing, then burnish them in the tumbler for 24 hours.",
        "Load them in with water and add 2 tbsp of chopped Ivory soap, which is especially mild and won't stain the rocks.",
        "Rinse the rocks after 24 hours have passed.",
        "Buffing Agate Manually with Sandpaper Clean each stone with warm water, dish soap, and a toothbrush.",
        "Remove any dirt or debris that\u2019s built-up on the rock\u2019s exterior.",
        "Fill a cup with warm water and squeeze in a drop of dish soap.",
        "Stir the mixture so it suds up.",
        "Then, dip the toothbrush in and scrub each rock thoroughly.",
        "Agate sometimes has surface crevices that dirt hides in.",
        "Pay attention to these areas and try to push the bristles into them for a thorough clean.",
        "Lay 180-grit sandpaper on a flat surface.",
        "A flat and stable tabletop is a good surface to work on.",
        "Take a piece of sandpaper at least 3 in (7.6 cm) by 3 in (7.6 cm).",
        "Place down a towel so you don\u2019t get debris on your table.",
        "Then lay the sandpaper flat on top of it.",
        "Lay down a cutting board for an extra layer of protection for your table.",
        "You can also use a Dremel tool to polish the rocks.",
        "Make sure you attach a polishing bit, because using a coarse bit will grind the rock down too much.",
        "Add a drop of water to the sandpaper.",
        "Don\u2019t sand rocks while they\u2019re dry or you\u2019ll scratch them up.",
        "Take a cup and pour a drop of water a few times larger than the rock you\u2019re polishing directly onto the sandpaper.",
        "Don\u2019t worry if a lot of water comes out.",
        "Too much water is better than not enough.",
        "Grind the stone on the sandpaper until the surface grit rubs away.",
        "Pick any side to start on.",
        "Rub back and forth with even pressure to grind off the agate\u2019s rough exterior.",
        "Switch to a different side when the previous section smooths out.",
        "Work around the whole rock with the same technique.",
        "Keep the rock wet through the whole sanding process.",
        "If the water dries up at any point, add more.",
        "Don\u2019t worry if the rock doesn\u2019t look smooth or shiny yet.",
        "The coarse-grit only works off the rough edges.",
        "Rinse the stone off in between grinding stages.",
        "Run the stone under the faucet to remove any debris and sanding material.",
        "Don\u2019t forget to rinse the stone after each sanding session so the sanding grits don\u2019t cross-contaminate.",
        "Don\u2019t worry about drying off the stone.",
        "Keep it wet for the sanding process.",
        "Repeat the process with 400, 600, and 1200 grit sandpaper.",
        "Work your way up to finer-grit sandpaper to gradually polish the stone.",
        "Use the same technique for each grit.",
        "Rinse the stone off and grind each side until it smooths out.",
        "As you reach finer grits, the stone will shine a bit more.",
        "Remember to rinse the stone and wet each piece of sandpaper before you start sanding.",
        "Rub the stone with powdered polish.",
        "Apply some powdered polish to a rag.",
        "Then rub each side of the stone until it shines.",
        "Rinse it one last time and dry it with a clean rag.",
        "You can buy powdered polish at a hardware store or online."
