        "Place the pan in your oven and bake the cornbread patties for 17 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown on both sides.",
        "To ensure even browning, cooking the patties on one side for 12 to 15 minutes, then flip them over to the other side and finish cooking an additional 5 minutes.",
        "Drain on paper towels.",
        "Remove the pan from the oven and lift the cornbread patties out of the oil.",
        "Transfer them to a plate lined with clean paper towels.",
        "This method doesn't use quite as much oil as stovetop frying requires, so there won't be as much oil to drain.",
        "Quickly dab both sides of each patty on the paper towels to remove most of the excess oil sitting on the surface.",
        "Serve hot.",
        "Enjoy the cornbread patties immediately.",
        "You can eat them plain, but you may also wish to serve them with salt, butter, honey, or preserves."
