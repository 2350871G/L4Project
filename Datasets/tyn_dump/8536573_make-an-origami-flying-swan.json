When finished, the bottom edge of the paper should now be flush with the left edge. Fold the excess paper down over the top of the triangle fold you just made.  Open the last fold and trim the excess. You should now have a square piece of paper. Fold the crease on top of itself and then unfold. You you should have a piece of paper with an \"X\" fold when finished. Flip the paper over, fold across the horizontal axis, and unfold.  Fold the paper across the vertical axis and unfold. Note: Green guide lines are for reference in the next step. Bring the edges of the 4 diagonal folds together. This corresponds to the green guide lines in the image above. With the diagonal folds together, fold the two adjacent  folds on each side onto each other to create a square.  Folding the Swan Position the square from Part 1 so that the crease runs vertically and the open end is facing down.  Fold the right side flap inwards.  Repeat the last step for the left side.  Fold the top triangle down on top of the last two folds.  Unfold the last three folds.  Carefully peel back the first layer of paper at the bottom and open it upwards.  After opening upwards, fold the paper on the creases that were made in steps 2, 3, and 4.  Crease the opposite side in the same way as the previous step.  Flip the paper over and fold the right side flap inwards.  Repeat with the left side flap.  Fold the top flap downwards.  Unfold the last three folds.  Carefully peel back the first layer of paper at the bottom and open it upwards.  Fold the left side inward over the creases.  Repeat with the right side.  Confirm that you now have a diamond-shaped paper with two free lower flaps.  Fold the right section upwards behind itself diagonally.  Repeat with the left section.  Carefully unfold the crease in the right section and open the fold.  With the fold open, fold the right section upwards into itself so that the section extends from the inside of the body.  Repeat steps 12 and 13 with the left section  Carefully pull the right section downwards to reduce the angle and re-crease.  Fold the left section downward to create a head shape.  Fold the left wing down and crease.  Flip over and repeat with the right wing.  Flapping the Wings Pinch the breast area of the swan with your left hand and the middle portion of the tail with your right hand.  Carefully pull diagonally towards the tip of the tail with your right hand. This should cause the wings to flap. Congratulations, you've just created a flapping swan!",
