You may choose to purchase different colors of clay to create the dog, or you can select to use one solid color and paint the dog after it is finished. Some clays, like polymer, can be baked into a finished piece very quickly in an oven. If you don't have an oven to use for your clay, you may prefer to select an air-dry clay, however, you will have to wait four or five days to finish it. If you are doing clay animation, you will want to select an oil-based clay that will not dry out."

Keep one larger piece to create the torso of the dog. Break off a piece for the head. Make four pieces of equal size to create the legs. Roll the pieces into balls to try and keep the size as even as possible for each leg. Make one smaller piece for the tail. Set the remainder aside to use for other small shapes that remain, such as the ears and eyes."

Round the edges a little to make the rectangular body look like a dog body. You may want to adjust the torso to be smaller or larger depending on the kind of dog you want to create. For example, a basset hound or dachshund will have a much longer body, but much shorter limbs. If you are making a large sculpture, you may want to crumple up damp newspaper and mold the clay around it. This will save you clay, make the sculpture lighter and save you time when baking."

You can use smaller pieces of clay to shape the pieces, or use your modeling tools to carve some of them into the existing form. The more time you take creating details, the more lifelike your dog will be. Consider adding a tongue. Add a small piece of thin clay out the side of your dog's mouth. Try pressing two small lines into each paw to create some toes. If you are using different colors of clay you can give your dogs some spots by adding small, thin patches of different colors over the body or legs. Create a collar by forming a long flat strip and wrapping it around the neck of the dog."
