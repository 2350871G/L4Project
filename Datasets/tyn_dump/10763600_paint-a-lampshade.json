        "Keep in mind that lighter colors will allow more light to shine through the lampshade.",
        "Mask off different geometric patterns instead of stripes for different looks.",
        "Use masking tape or blue painter\u2019s tape to make zig-zags, Xs, hexagons, or just random patterns on the lampshade.",
        "Paint the areas inside or outside the tape with a small flat paint brush and acrylic paint to create your designs.",
        "You can use chalk paint to create a more distressed, aged look.",
        "Fabric paint is another paint option similar to acrylic, but will soak into the fabric more.",
        "Use stencils instead of tape to paint on more complex designs.",
        "Draw any design you want on a piece of paper and carefully cut it out with scissors or a utility knife to create a stencil.",
        "Tape the stencil to the lampshade and dab paint of your choosing onto the shade with a stencil brush.",
        "You can also buy stencils at an art store or print out designs to cut out.",
        "A stencil brush has a flat, round tip for dabbing paint on rather than brushing it on.",
        "This helps prevent bleeding and keeps the paint within the lines of your stencil.",
        "Sketch a design in pencil and paint over it, or free-hand paint a design.",
        "Use a pencil to draw any design you can imagine onto the lampshade.",

        "It may help to have a variety of paintbrushes in different sizes, depending on how intricate your design is.",
        "Think of your lampshade as a coloring book.",
        "You can draw on intricate geometric patterns like mandalas or anything else that you think will be fun to paint!",
        "Attach the lampshade to the lamp once it is dry and turn the lamp on.",
        "Let the paint dry for at least 1-2 hours until it is totally dry to the touch.",
        "Place it back onto the base of the lamp and turn the lamp on to see if you need to add another coat of paint.",
        "Check for spots all around the shade where the light shines through and makes it look blotchy.",
        "If you see any, take the shade off and add another coat of paint until you are happy with how it looks."
