Don't press the coffee down, but you can smooth it with a spoon to ensure that none of the grounds spill out of the filter.

Use an instant read thermometer to monitor the temperature of the milk so you know when to froth it. It should be between 130 and 150 degrees Fahrenheit (54 to 66 degrees Celsius). Skim milk is the best option if you want a skinny latte. However, 1% or 2% milk can also work. Just be aware that the latte will just have more fat and calories. You can use non-dairy milk for the latte as well."

Turn it on low and gently move it around the milk, keeping it fully submerged. After 5 to 10 seconds, increase the speed to high and move the wand up so it's just beneath the surface of the milk to create more foam.
