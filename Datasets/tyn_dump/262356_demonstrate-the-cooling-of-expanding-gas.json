The second container will be empty and provide additional volume for the gas to occupy as it expands. Use a valved hose or pipe to connect these containers so that the contents of the connected containers can be closed off from one another. Pressurize the first container. Check the valve between the containers to confirm that it is closed. Use a cylinder of compressed air to force air into the first container. Pressurize the container to approximately 1.5 atm.

Understanding the Results Consider the ideal gas law. The ideal gas law describes the behavior of a hypothetical gas in which molecules do not interact with each other, except for totally elastic collisions.

Thus, it is clear that real gases do not behave in an \u201cideal\u201d way. The equation describing this behavior is PV=nR:\n\n\nP = Pressure\nV = Volume\nn = Moles of Gas\nR = Ideal Gas Constant\nT = Temperature Realize that gas molecules interact with each other. The primary difference between ideal and real gases is that real gases have molecules that interact in inelastic ways. That is to say, the energetic state of the molecules changes based on how they interact with each other. This means that heat will rise in a smaller volume of gas (due to more collisions between molecules) and will fall when the same amount of gas occupies a larger volume.
