        "Continue the cycle until you have 0 ppm of ammonia, 0 ppm of nitrite, and a nitrate reading.",
        "Once nitrite starts to dip along with ammonia, it's a sign that your bacteria have grown and you're near the end of the cycle.",
        "At this point, nitrate\u2014the end product of the nitrogen cycle\u2014will start to rise.",
        "Continue adding 1/4 of the initial ammonia dosage until the bacteria are strong enough to bring the next reading to 0 ppm within 24 hours of a 2 ppm reading.",
        "Swapping Water and Adding Fish Test your tank with 1 ammonia dose before adding fish.",
        "Before adding your fish, add 1 dose of ammonia to bring the water to 2 ppm.",
        "Afterward, let it sit overnight and test the tank the next day\u2014you should only detect nitrate.",
        "If your ammonia or nitrite levels are over 0 ppm, you need to continue the process of cycling and testing the water.",
        "Don't add fish until your nitrite and ammonia levels read 0 ppm.",
        "Remove 50 percent of the water and replace it with tap water.",
        "Now that your healthy bacteria are thriving, you can reduce the nitrate to similar levels found in tap water.",
        "Use a bucket to manually remove the water or use it in conjunction with a siphon to minimize the heavy lifting.",
        "After removing 50 percent of the old water, fill the tank back up with tap water.",
        "The maximum nitrate levels for tap water set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is 10 ppm.",
        "If you find anything higher than this, don't use the water.",
        "If you add cold water, make sure the temperature is right for your specific fish species.",
        "Swap another 50 percent of the aquarium water with tap water.",
        "After doing one swap, remove another 50 percent of the water with a bucket and siphon (optional).",
        "Now, top it up again with tap water.",
        "At this point, nitrate levels should be close to those in tap water, your nitrogen-fixing bacteria should be thriving, and you're ready to go!",
        "If you add cold water, make sure the temperature is right for the intended residents.",
        "Use testing strips to double check that PH, GH, and KH are normal.",
        "Add your fish to the tank after swapping the water twice.",
        "Once the water has been swapped twice, nitrate levels will be similar to tap water levels.",
        "Now, make sure the temperature is between 75 to 80 \u00b0F (24 to 27 \u00b0C) and add your fish to the tank.",
        "Check the exact temperature recommendation for your fishes, as they can vary by species.",
        "If you're waiting to add your fish after swapping the water, continue adding ammonia to 2 ppm to keep the bacteria healthy until the fish arrive.",
        "Test and swap your water after each fishless cycle.",
        "Every time you run a fishless cycle to prepare your tank for new fish, test your tank for healthy bacteria and swap the water to reduce nitrate levels.",
        "Although nitrate is a natural byproduct of healthy bacteria, the high levels created by fishless cycles are not healthy for fish.",
        "Use a water conditioner when swapping water."
