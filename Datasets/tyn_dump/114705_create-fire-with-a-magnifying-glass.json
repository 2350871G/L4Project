Make sure that natural substances are dry before you attempt to light them on fire. Wet leaves or pine needles will smolder and smoke, but never actually burn. Igniting the Tinder Choose a safe location to light a fire. Make a fire with your magnifying glass in a location where the fire cannot burn anything else but tinder. Suitable places include a cement sidewalk, an area of dirt with no vegetation surrounding it, or a bricked in fire hole. If you are in the forest don\u2019t have a clear area nearby, you can use the side of your foot to sweep leaves and pine needles off of a patch of soil, and then light the fire on the dirt. Hold the magnifying glass between the sun and the tinder. You\u2019ll notice that a small, bright dot appears on the newspaper. Tilt the magnifying glass back and forth as needed to change the dot\u2019s size. In order to create enough heat to start a flame, the circle must be as small as possible. Aim to focus the circle until it\u2019s only about \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) across. Focus the dot in one place for 20-30 seconds. Hold the magnifying glass still until the tinder begins smoking.
