But if you purchase your spline separately, make sure its width matches the width of your frame's spline groove.

The aluminum framing is soft metal and very flexible. It can easily be warped and ripped from the screening\u2014hold it firmly against a flat surface and make sure all of the edges are parallel. Lay the screening material straight onto the frame. While holding the frame firmly against a flat surface, lay your screening down over it. The screening should be 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.6 cm) more than the aluminum framing on all four sides. Have a friend hold the frame steady as you pull the screening over the surface for better results. Cut the screening material 1 inch (2.5 cm) bigger than the frame. Pull the screening tight, first in the length and then in the width. Take care not get a warp in the frame or waves in the screening material. Now, use a standard pair of scissors to cut the screening approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) larger than the frame. Don't worry about cutting completely straight\u2014giving yourself enough extra screening material is more important. Attaching Your Screen to the Frame Press the wire screening material into the frame channel with a spline roller. Feed the spline through the spline roller starting from the back (concave) to the front (convex). Roll the front spline all the way around the front circular leg. Now, starting in the corner of the frame, push the front circular leg down the frame channel, making sure that the back leg follows behind.

When using a spline roller, always make sure the legs are aligned with the channel and don't come loose as you move. Press firmly down onto the mount to keep it steady as you drag the spline roller through the frame channel. Pull the screen material tightly away from the frame as you move the spline roller. Press the rubber spline into the frame with the back end of the spline roller. Remove all of the spline from the roller.

Place the utility knife at a 45-degree angle and pull it along the frame outline right above the spline. Continue this for all 4 sides, taking care to make even cuts. Apply a firm amount of pressure down on the knife when making your cuts. Turn the window screen with the spline facing inside your home. Before mounting your window screen, position the spline inside your home. In addition, make sure any spring clips face upward to fit into the top window slot. Be sure the spline is firmly connected to the aluminum frame before installing it in your window opening.",
