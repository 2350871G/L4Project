        "Before buying soil and fertilizer, get a home soil testing kit or take a sample of your soil to a soil lab or garden center for testing.",
        "Once you know your soil\u2019s pH (how acidic or alkaline it is) and nutrient content, you will have an easier time choosing plants and amending your soil, if you need to.",
        "Most plants prefer a slightly acidic to neutral soil pH of around 6-7.",
        "However, some plants, such as azaleas, blueberries, and potatoes, prefer more acidic soils.",
        "Research the soil pH needs of the plants you wish to grow.",
        "At minimum, all plants need nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), and potassium (K) to thrive.",
        "They also benefit from a variety of other nutrients and trace elements in the soil.",
        "Get a testing kit that checks for a range of soil nutrients, or send your soil to a lab that will do a thorough nutrient analysis.",
        "Purchase organic soil, if necessary.",
        "If your soil is of very poor quality or will not support the kinds of plants you wish to grow, you can purchase organic gardening soil from a garden center or online retailer.",
        "Look for soil that is labeled \u201cOrganic\u201d or labeled with an organic certification logo.",
        "Organic soil mixes should contain organic matter (such as compost, peat moss, or worm castings) that can encourage microbial activity and provide nutrients for your plants.",
        "Most pre-packaged gardening soil is designed to be either used in containers or mixed in with your pre-existing soil.",
        "Follow the instructions on the label carefully.",
        "Amend your soil\u2019s pH with organic materials, if you need to.",
        "If testing reveals that your soil\u2019s pH is too low or too high for the plants you\u2019re interested in growing, you can add organic materials to the soil to change the pH.",
        "For example:\nYou can lower the pH of your soil with sphagnum peat or organic mulch.",
        "Raise the pH of your soil with calcium-rich oyster or clam shells, shell marl, dolomite, gypsum, or wood ash.",
        "It is preferable to to choose plants that are suited to your native soil rather than trying to amend it.",
        "Enrich your soil with organic compost.",
        "Compost encourages healthy microbial activity in your soil and offers nutrients to your plants.",
        "When done properly, composting can destroy weed seeds in manure and other organic fertilizers.",
        "You can make your own compost in your yard from kitchen scraps, or buy organic compost from a garden center or organic farm in your area.",
        "If you buy compost, avoid anything containing \u201cbiosolids,\u201d which may include human waste and synthetic chemical pollutants.",
        "If you choose to make your own compost, include things like fruit and vegetable scraps, healthy lawn clippings, eggshells, and sawdust from untreated wood.",
        "If you want to reduce the potential concentrations of pesticides or other unwanted compounds as much as possible, only use organic food scraps in your compost.",
        "Do not attempt to compost with meat, fat, dairy products, leaves or wood from diseased plants, sawdust or wood chips from treated wood, or pet waste.",
        "Feed your plants with organic fertilizers.",
        "Organic fertilizers come in both liquid and dry forms.",
        "Select your fertilizers based on the needs of your plants and any nutritional deficiencies in your soil.",
        "If your soil needs more nitrogen, use urea, feathers, blood meal, bat guano, or composted manure.",
        "For a phosphorous boost, apply rock phosphate, bone meal, or colloidal phosphate.",
        "Add more potassium to your soil with kelp, wood ash, granite meal, or greensand.",
        "You can also buy organic fertilizer blends with different combinations of nutrients.",
        "Read the package directions carefully to determine how much fertilizer to apply, and how frequently to apply it.",
        "Retest your soil a year after making amendments.",
        "It can take time for soil amendments to take effect.",
        "It\u2019s a good idea to retest your soil occasionally to make sure that any deficiencies or problems have been corrected.",
        "If you\u2019ve had to make major changes to your soil\u2019s pH or nutrient levels, recheck your soil about a year after making the initial amendments.",
        "Even if you didn\u2019t have to make any major changes, keep an eye on the condition of your soil by testing pH and nutrient levels every 3 years.",
        "Buying Organic Plants and Seeds Look for seed packets bearing an organic certification seal.",
        "Seeds from organically grown plants are available in most nurseries and garden supply centers.",
        "Check the package carefully for a seal from one of your country\u2019s organic certification organizations.",
        "For example, if you are in the U.S., look for the \u201cUSDA Organic\u201d seal on the seed packet.",
        "Get organically grown potted plants.",
        "If you\u2019d rather not grow from seed, you can also purchase established, organically grown plants for your home or garden.",
        "Several major seed companies sell certified non-GMO organic plants through mail-order catalogs or through nurseries and garden supply centers.",
        "When purchasing plants, look for an organic certification seal on the plant\u2019s label or container.",
        "If you're not sure whether a plant you're interested in was organically grown, ask the retailer.",
        "Buy plants and seeds directly from local suppliers.",
        "One of the best ways to get organic seeds and plants is to buy locally from a supplier who uses organic growing practices.",
        "Do a search for \u201ccertified organic seed supplier near me.\u201d\nCheck the supplier\u2019s website for information about their certifications, or call them and ask about their certification status.",
        "For example, in the U.S., find out if the supplier is certified through the USDA National Organic Program or OMRI.",
        "Using Sustainable Gardening Practices Control pests with organic pesticides, traps, and beneficial bugs.",
        "Plant-eating bugs and other pests are a common problem in gardens, but you don\u2019t have to resort to harsh chemical pesticides to deal with them.",
        "Try some of the following gentle methods to repel or eliminate pests:\nSpray infested plants with a combination of water and a mild dish detergent.",
        "Use 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of detergent per gallon (3.8 l) of water.",
        "Set out beer traps to catch plant-munching snails and slugs.",
        "Buy a certified organic pesticide spray from your local garden center.",
        "Introduce ladybugs, praying mantises, and other pest-eating bugs into your garden.",
        "You can attract them naturally with wildflowers (such as daisies and Queen Anne\u2019s lace) or purchase them at your garden supply store.",
        "Kill weeds naturally with mulch or organic weed killer.",
        "Instead of using harsh weed killers that can hurt the desirable plants in your garden and contaminate the environment, try a gentler, more environmentally friendly method.",
        "For example, you might:\nSpread a thin layer of newspaper, cardboard, or biodegradable cloth over your planting area, then cover it with 2-4 inches (5-10 cm) of organic mulch to smother weeds and insulate desirable plants.",
        "Spray weeds directly with a mixture of white vinegar and dish soap.",
        "Purchase an organic weed killer from your local garden center or home supply store.",
        "Most of these weed killers are made with natural plant oils, such as neem oil or citrus oil.",
        "Buy environmentally friendly garden tools.",
        "In addition to your plants, fertilizers, and pest control supplies, also consider the environmental impact of your tools.",
        "Look for products that are reusable, biodegradable, or made from recycled materials.",
        "Opt for tools that are mechanical instead of motorized, when you can.",
        "For example, you might use:\nTrellises, brooms, and other garden accessories made of sustainable bamboo.",
        "Biodegradable planters that can go straight into the ground during planting.",
        "Watering cans and other tools made of recycled plastic or other post-consumer recycled materials.",
        "Old-fashioned push reel mowers or scythes instead of motorized mowers and weed-whackers.",
        "Flea markets, second-hand stores or garage sales are good places to find used gardening tools.",
        "Water your plants with collected rainwater, if possible.",
        "Save water and avoid introducing water-treatment chemicals into your garden by collecting water directly from the skies.",
        "The easiest way to do this is to connect a rainwater diverter and rain barrel to the drainpipe on your roof.",
        "The diverter can send water to 1 or more linked collection barrels.",
        "You can buy rain barrels, diverters, and barrel linking kits at most home and garden supply centers.",
        "You can also make your own rain barrel.",
        "Alternatively, you can make a rain garden, a garden planted in a shallow depression that catches rain water directly from roof gutters, downspouts, or your property\u2019s natural runoff pathways."
