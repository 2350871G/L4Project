Imagine you are writing a story and need to map out the plot. Use the rule of threes.

Tell a story or ask a question to get the audience thinking right away. This will help evoke a mental image and get them thinking critically about what you\u2019re saying. Find the most compelling data. Balance that and then tell them why the data is important in each of your three sections. Remember, most of the data can be shown with visual aids, so don\u2019t over report. Ask the audience questions.
