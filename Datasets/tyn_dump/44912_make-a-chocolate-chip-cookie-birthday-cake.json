                    "description": "To make sure that your oven is hot enough when the cake is ready to bake, it\u2019s important to preheat it. Set your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat. Next, grease a 8- or 9-inch (20- or 23-cm) cake or pie pan and set aside. Keep an eye on your oven so you know when it\u2019s fully preheated. Most models will beep and/or flash an indicator light to alert you that it\u2019s reached the desired temperature. You can use a springform for the cake if you\u2019re worried about the sides sticking to the pan after baking. Use nonstick cooking spray, butter, or margarine to grease the pan."

Walnuts are usually paired with chocolate chips, but you can add chopped pecans or macadamia nuts if you prefer."
