    "text": " Beginning Your Crocheting Attach your yarn to your crochet hook with a slip knot. Loop the yarn around the pointer and middle fingers of your left hand. Stick your hook through the circle, hooking the working end of your yarn with the hook and then pulling it back through the center of the circle. This will give you one loop on your crochet hook. Crochet a chain of four stitches. This will form the very center of the circle you are crocheting. If you are following a pattern you may need to make a different number of chains to start. This will change the number of stitches you make in further steps but will not change the general technique. Make a slip stitch in the first chain you made, forming the four chains you made into a ring. Insert the hook into the loop of the first chain you made. Once through, hook the working end of the yarn onto the hook and then pull it back through the loop and also through the loop that was on your hook. Now the piece is formed into a circle and you have one loop on your hook. Crocheting Through the Center of Your Ring Insert your hook into the center of the ring. Be sure that you are going through the very center and not one of the stitches you made. Yarn over your hook. To \"yarn over\" means that you need to hook the working end of your yarn onto your hook. Then twist your hook slightly, so that the yarn stays hooked on. Pull the loop back through the center of the ring. Two loops should be on the hook after you complete this step. Yarn over once again, and this time, without going through the center of your project, pull the loop you just looped onto your hook, back through both of the strands that are already on your hook. This is the finishing step of the basic stitch called a \"Single Crochet\". Continue making \"Single Crochet\" stitches through the center of the ring. In all you will make eight single crochet stitches around forming a tiny circle for the beginning of your project. Crocheting the First Regular Round Insert your hook through both strands of the first stitch you made in the last round. This will be the first step in creating a connection between the end of the last round to the beginning of it and setting the stage to start another. Yarn over your hook and pull the loop through to the front. Two loops should now be on the hook. Yarn over your hook again, then pull the working end of the yarn through both loops you had on your hook. This the finishing step of the single crochet stitch which joins everything into a circle. This stitch is also the first single crochet of the next round. (Stitch 1 of 16 total.) Make another Single Crochet stitch in the same stitch where you just made the first single crochet of this round. Now continue around the circle by making two single crochet stitches in each single crochet stitch of the first ring. Doing this is called an \"increase\". This means that there will be 16 stitches when you complete the round. Please count them. Doing two stitches in each one stitch from the previous round is how we \"increase\" the size of the circle we are making. Crocheting Successive Rounds Complete the second regular round in much the same way as you completed the first regular round. However, this time you will put only one single crochet in the first stitch but then put two single crochet stitches in the next stitch. Do this \"increase\" in every other stitch of the previous round. Repeat this to the end of the round. Continue increasing the number of stitches for each round until the project reaches your desired diameter. Make one single crochet in the first stitch, then make two single crochets in the next stitch. On the next round do two stitches in every third stitch, then two stitches in every fourth stitch and so on. See a pattern developing? To keep increasing, put two stitches in the n-th stitch where n is the number of the round you're currently working on. For instance, if you are working on the fourth round, put two stitches in every fourth stitch as you work your way around. You may loop a shot piece of contrasting colored yarn through each round if you wish, to help know which row you are on. End off your project by cutting the yarn at least 6 inches away from your last stitch, then use the hook to pull this \"tail\" or \"end\" all the way through the very last loop of the very last stitch.
