Then, use some extra paper towels to finish drying off each piece. Removing the fat and grease helps the jerky to last longer in storage. When you first take homemade jerky out of the oven, keep it cool on the paper towels for 2 hours. Most of the grease will drain off as the jerky cools. Store-bought deer jerky is already dry, so you won\u2019t have to do anything to it. Keep it sealed until you\u2019re ready to eat it. If it comes in a resealable bag, keep it in the bag and store it like other jerky."

Push as much air as possible out before sealing it shut. Label the bag with today\u2019s date when you\u2019re done. Glass containers, such as Mason jars, do a good job of sealing in jerky. Use them for shelf or refrigerator storage. You could also use plastic refrigerator or freezer-safe containers, but they tend to retain some air. The jerky could lose its quality a little faster than normal. If you have a vacuum sealer, you can use it to preserve the jerky for longer than normal. It can last for 1 to 2 months when left out or put into the refrigerator."

Cooler areas are usually fine too, as long as you are able to keep the jerky dry. Make sure it isn\u2019t placed near any sort of heat or moisture, including from heating vents and air conditioners. You could also keep the jerky in a closed-off spot, such as your pantry or a closet. However, be mindful of how often you open the door. Another option is to store the jerky on a lower floor of your home, such as in your basement. Keep it away from any windows or damp spots there. If you have a damp basement, try not to store jerky there unless it is well-sealed. If you notice leaks, water spots, moisture, or other signs of water, consider finding another spot."

Pull the jerky out if you notice any moisture forming inside the container. Dry it off, then repackage it. With careful treatment, it may stay fresh for even longer. Store-bought jerky is preserved so that it can last about 1 year before you open it the first time. After opening it, store it like regular jerky to keep it fresh for up to 3 weeks."
