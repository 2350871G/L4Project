It may not kill the ants right away, but they should be mostly controlled within 1 week. Non-repellent pesticides create a barrier that ants pass through so that they bring the poison back to the nest. Pay attention to where ants are coming from in your yard. They could be near your house, along a fence, or in the cracks of your pavement. Look for small mounds of dirt to find the ant nests. Limit spreading pesticides to every 6 months."
