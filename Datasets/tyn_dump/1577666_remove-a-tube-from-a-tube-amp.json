If the tube is burnt-out and will not glow when the amp is powered on, then replacement is necessary. If the amp has begun sounding excessively muddled, produces hissing or squealing noises, or demonstrates unpredictable fluctuations in volume, the tubes are probably worn and should be replaced. With average playing time at average volume levels, tubes should be replaced about once a year."
