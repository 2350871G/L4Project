Go with a darker hue, like charcoal gray or navy blue, and buy about one size too big to get the right disheveled look. This is the easiest way to take care of the body portion of the costume.

Snag a black button-down work shirt a basic pair of black trousers and rough them up yourself at home. Look for a loose-fitting brown coat to wear over the shirt. You won\u2019t win any style points, but you\u2019ll have the cheerleaders fleeing for their lives. Be on the lookout for cheap secondhand clothing to use for your costume.

Find yourself a pair of chunky black work boots made of leather, canvas or some other heavy material. If you desire, slather them with mud or fake blood to make them look old and used. These will complete the effect of your costume from top to bottom. Visit a thrift store to get an appropriate pair of old boots that won\u2019t run you too much money.

Smear some black and brown makeup on the mask or dirty it up outside to make it look like it\u2019s followed you to the grave and back. Since the hockey mask is one of the most important elements of the costume, you should be willing to devote a little more time, money and attention to making sure it\u2019s just right.

Fortunately, this part of the costume is extremely easy to replicate. For best results, use a different pillowcase than the one you plan to lug your Halloween candy around in later. To make an eye hole for visibility, put the pillowcase on over your head, mark where your left eye is with a pencil and then use scissors to carefully cut out the eye hole. If you want to be especially accurate, keep the pillow case secured around your neck using a little rope or butcher\u2019s twine."

        "Buy used clothing at thrift stores or consignment shops for a bargain so that you can tear them up without feeling like you\u2019re throwing money away.",
        "Go over different sections of the clothing with a steel brush or coarse-grained sandpaper to make it look naturally frayed.",
        "Suit up with some of Jason\u2019s other accessories.",
        "Jason was ready for anything, and you should be too.",
        "Though his look changed subtly from film to film, certain accessories could almost always be found.",
        "A pair of thick yellow work gloves, for instance, a utility belt with pouches or a sheath for a hunting knife can make the difference between a generic Jason costume and a more detailed one.",
        "These accessories will look best when paired with a basic jumpsuit, echoing Jason\u2019s formative look in Friday the 13th Parts 4-6.",
        "Wear a grotesque mask underneath the hockey mask or pillow case.",
        "At the end of every Friday the 13th flick comes the big reveal when Jason\u2019s mask comes off and the hideous face that lies beneath is exposed.",
        "Mimic these shocking scenes by wearing a mask underneath your hockey mask or pillowcase that gives you a stomach-turning, disfigured appearance.",
        "You can even find deluxe compound Halloween masks that layer detachable hockey masks over Jason\u2019s ugly mug.",
        "Try to find a thin rubber mask that wears comfortably and will allow the hockey mask or pillowcase to fit over it easily.",
        "If you don\u2019t want to bother with wearing two separate masks, just slip on a bald cap under the hockey mask so that your own hair isn\u2019t visible.",
        "Wrap yourself in fake chains.",
        "Jason\u2019s one true fear is water, and he once nearly met his fate while chained to a boulder at the bottom of Crystal Lake.",
        "For a little bonus detail, try winding a length of fake chains around your body and let the world know that it can\u2019t keep you down.",
        "You can find plastic chain props at most Halloween costume suppliers, or you may be able to find some cheap chains made from real metal for a more realistic clink while you lurch about threatening hippies.",
        "Small touches like this are a great way to win favor with horror movie aficionados."
