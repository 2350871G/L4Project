Run a piece of string or twine through the holes, allowing the pages to remain loose enough that they can be turned. Punch an additional hole, located directly opposite the central hole, through every page so that you can hang the calendar up later. White paper or cardstock is probably the best option, since it will allow for the most visibility, but you could also use yellow, light blue, or another color that enables good visibility. Alternately, you could use more than one color, so that each month the calendar pages is a different color."
