You'll end up with a tiny rocket that shoots out smoke and hot air when lit, pushing itself up and away. To get started, cut out a foil square about 5 x 7 inches (13 x 18 cm) works well. There are two types of foil: normal and heavy-duty. Heavy duty foil makes a better seal, but it will weigh down your rocket if you use too much."

Try to keep the foil tight against the skewer, and as even as you can. Pull out the skewer, leaving a hollow foil tube behind. You can buy wooden skewers at most grocery stores. If you don't have one, wrap a smaller piece of foil around a matchstick instead."

If one end of the tube is more uneven or ragged than the other, put the match head near this end. You can put more match heads into the rocket if you want, as long as you leave that space in the end.

Aluminum foil tape works best. Fold it along the diagonal, then turn it over and crease the same fold the other way. Unfold and repeat along the second diagonal. Fold it along both folds and cut off the central corner. You should now have a square with a hole in it. Remove the anti-stick backing.
