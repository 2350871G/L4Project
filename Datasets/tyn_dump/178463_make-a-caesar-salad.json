Making the Salad Chop the base off of the lettuce and discard it. Gently pull apart the leaves so that they are separate. At this point, you can also remove and discard any wilted or damaged leaves. For a more classic salad, use Romaine lettuce hearts instead. They do not need to be chopped down into smaller pieces. This is what the original salad used. Wash and dry the lettuce thoroughly.

Season the croutons with salt, cayenne pepper, and black pepper. Add the seasoning into the bowl, and continue tossing the croutons until they are evenly coated.
