        "This should be frequent enough to keep your clear coat in good shape.",
        "At a minimum, wax your vehicle 2 times a year.",
        "The best times to wax are late spring (right before summer) and late fall (just before winter).",
        "Waxing at least at these 2 points in time will protect your clear coat against the intense summer sun and salt-covered winter roads.",
        "If you live down a dirt or gravel-covered road, you may want to wax your vehicle every 2 months.",
        "The same goes if you live in an area with frequent snowfall, since the salt put down on the roads after a snow can damage your vehicle\u2019s clear coat.",
        "Select a wax made to cover clear coats.",
        "Some waxes are abrasive and rough and may end up doing more harm than good when you apply them to your clear coat.",
        "So, find a clear-coat friendly wax at your local automotive supply store.",
        "Look at the labels of the wax containers, and peruse until you find one that reads \u201cclear-coat safe\u201d on the label.",
        "If you\u2019re struggling to find a clear-coat safe car wax, ask the service staff at the automotive store for help.",
        "Wax your car in the shade in moderate temperatures.",
        "Plan to wax your car under a shady tree or awning when the outdoor temperature is between 50\u201370 \u00b0F (10\u201321 \u00b0C).",
        "If you try to wax your vehicle in cold weather, the wax will be sluggish and may barely move when you try to spread it on the paint.",
        "Conversely, if you wax your vehicle in hot weather, the wax may run or the heat may bake the wax into the clear coat.",
        "If you need to watch the weather and wait a few days before waxing your car, do it.",
        "It\u2019s better to delay waxing for a few days than to have your wax coating ruined by extreme hot or cold temperatures.",
        "Dab your wax onto a microfiber cloth.",
        "Microfiber is an excellent material for applying wax, since it won\u2019t scratch the surface of your car.",
        "Squeeze out a 1 inch (2.5 cm) dollop of wax onto your cloth.",
        "Once you\u2019ve applied this entire amount, squeeze out another dollop of the same size.",
        "Avoid using too much wax at once, or you\u2019ll have a hard time applying it evenly to your entire vehicle.",
        "It\u2019s most effective to apply the wax shortly after you\u2019ve washed and dried your car.",
        "Rub wax evenly across the entire painted surface of your vehicle.",
        "Work in long, vertical strokes to ensure complete coverage and prevent swirls from forming in the wax.",
        "It\u2019s better to apply the wax too lightly than too heavily, since an overly heavy application of wax may soak into small cracks in the car.",
        "This wax is often impossible to remove.",
        "If your first microfiber cloth gets saturated with wax, swap it out and wax with a second microfiber cloth.",
        "Buff the wax with a clean microfiber cloth until it shines.",
        "Once you\u2019ve finished applying the wax, you\u2019re ready to buff.",
        "This will force the wax into the clear coat and maximize the protection that the wax affords.",
        "Buff in long vertical strokes to ensure that you buff the entire painted surface of your vehicle.",
        "Waxing your vehicle should take a total of about 1 hour."
