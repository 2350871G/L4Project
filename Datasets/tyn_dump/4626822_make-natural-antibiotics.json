Inhale oil directly to reduce and possibly eliminate the impact of a sinus infection. Pour oil into a ceramic mug or small glass bowl. Heat in the microwave (or in a pan on the stovetop) until oil is simmering. Hover over the mug or bowl and cover your entire head with a towel. Keep towel open toward mug or bowl. Breathe deeply and inhale oil--keep eyes closed to avoid irritation."
