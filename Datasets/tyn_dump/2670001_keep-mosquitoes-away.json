Keeping yourself covered in long sleeves, pants, and shoes will reduce mosquito attraction and also make it harder for them to bite you. Many outdoor superstores carry lightweight outerwear, so that wearing long layers is still cool and comfortable even in extremely warm temperatures. Choose light-colored clothes, like whites, tans, and pastels. Mosquitoes are attracted to dark colors, like black and navy."

DEET is safe when used as directed and can be used on kids as young as 2 months, but be sure to read safety and application instructions before applying. Eucalyptus, lemon essential oil, and picaridin are also effective ingredients in mosquito repellents. All lotions and sprays eventually wear off, so be sure to follow application instructions. If you prefer to use a natural homemade repellent, combine 2 ounces of witch hazel and 2 ounces of distilled water in a spray bottle and add a total of 40 to 50 drops of essential oil, like citronella, eucalyptus, and lemon essential oils (you can choose your own combination). You'll want to use half the amount of drops if you're applying the repellent to children under 3 years old."
