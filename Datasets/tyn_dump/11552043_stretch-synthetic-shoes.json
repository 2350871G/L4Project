Once your shoes get used to the shape of your feet, they\u2019ll stretch out to comfortably fit your feet.Warning: If your shoes start to hurt your feet, take them off. It\u2019s not worth damaging your toes or feet just to stretch your shoes out. There are plenty of other methods that you can use that don\u2019t involve forcing your feet into small shoes. Keep in mind that plastic-based shoes can only stretch half a size or, if you\u2019re lucky, one full size. Avoid trying this technique on faux leather, which is a tougher material."
