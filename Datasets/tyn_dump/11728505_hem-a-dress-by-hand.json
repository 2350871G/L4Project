Instead, stand up stand with your feet flat on the floor so you can see where the dress falls. If you want to make the dress shorter, determine how much fabric you'd like to remove. You can try on the shoes that you plan to wear with the dress in order to get an idea of where you want the hemline. However, take them off when you begin to mark the hemline or it may be slanted.

Consider purchasing scissors that you only use for sewing projects and never use them to cut paper or cardboard, which could blunt them. Skip this step if you're hemming the unfinished edge from a dress that you've already measured and cut. Hand-Stitching the Hem Fold the edge of the fabric over 2 inches (5.1 cm) and tuck the raw edge under. Take the raw edge of the fabric and bring it up so the bottom of the fabric lines up with the hemline that you marked. Then, fold the top \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) of the folded fabric under to hide the raw edge.Variation: For a completely no-sew option, cut a strip of fusible hem that's as long as the hemline.

To prevent the folded edge from coming undone, stick a sewing pin through the folded fabric. Ensure that you insert the pins vertically so they secure the folds. Position the sewing pins about every 4 inches (10 cm) so the fabric doesn't slide around. Thread a sewing needle. Cut a length of thread that's about 20 inches (51 cm) long and thread it through the eye of a sewing needle. Then, make a knot at the tail. It's important to choose thread that perfectly matches the dress. This way, it won't be noticeable if someone sees the dress's inner hemline. Insert the needle into the fabric at the seam. Keep the dress turned inside out so you're only sewing through the wrong side of the fabric. Find the vertical seam where the dress pieces are sewn together.

Insert the tip of the needle into a single stitch below the fold. Ensure that you're sewing on the folded fabric instead of above it. Then, pull the thread so it secures the fold in place. Pull gently so you don't make the hemline pucker. Work the blind hem stitch from right to left across the entire hemline.

If you're left-handed, it's probably easier to sew from left to right. Trim the thread tail and turn the hemmed dress right side out. Once you reach the seam where you started hemming the dress, insert the needle and pull until you make a loop. Bring the needle through the loop to knot the thread. Do this 1 more time before trimming off the excess thread and turning the dress right side out.",
