As you improve, practice turning your feet and standing sideways, with your shoulders parallel to the line. Once you improve (or if the landing is not safe for bare feet), you may want to switch to shoes since they provide greater protection when attempting tricks and landing."

Practice from the same place each time since the slackline oscillates differently at different distances from the anchors. The wobbles are faster and smaller near the anchors and slower and larger near the middle. But wherever you start, it is going to wobble a lot. This is natural; everyone wobbles the first time."
