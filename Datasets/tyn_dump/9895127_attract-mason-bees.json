Using paper straws instead of plastic ones will help prevent mold, but you should still change out the nest every year in the spring when the bees leave the nest. If you're using a milk carton, cut off the top part so that you can easily stack lots of straws.

        "Lavender, crocus, and salvia are perfect purple flowers.",
        "Sunflowers and black-eyed Susans are great yellow flowers.",
        "Butterfly bush, catmint, and common heliotrope are options for blue flowers.",
        "Pear blossoms and daisies are white flowers that attract mason bees.",
        "Avoid using pesticides on your flowers.",
        "It\u2019s best to avoid using pesticides on your garden in general, but this is especially important if you\u2019re trying to attract bees that will be eating the pollen.",
        "If you have to use pesticides, use them when there aren\u2019t open blossoms, which is when the bees will be pollinating.",
        "Creating a Mud Source Create a clay-mud source within 50 feet (15 m) of the nest.",
        "The mason bees need mud nearby to use it when they divide the chambers of their nest.",
        "They\u2019ll need to make many trips back and forth, so provide a mud source close to the nest for them, either by making your own mud source or buying a mud mix.",
        "Unless you have super sandy soil and no access to other types of soil, you can easily make your own mud source.",
        "Dig a shallow hole and line it with plastic.",
        "Use a shovel to dig a shallow hole in the ground.",
        "The hole doesn't need to be wider than 1 foot (30 cm), and a depth of about 10\u201312 inches (25\u201330 cm) should be perfect.",
        "You can also use a shallow metal or plastic tray to hold the mud instead of digging a hole in the ground.",
        "Fill the hole with soil.",
        "You don't have to fill the hole all the way up with soil, but it should be at least four-fifths full.",
        "Adding water to the soil will likely cause it to flatten a bit, so don't worry about adding too much.",
        "You want the soil to be more clay-filled than sandy\u2014sandy soil won\u2019t work well.",
        "If you have sandy soil, you can buy more clay-rich soils at a garden store, nursery, or online.",
        "Keep the mud source moist throughout the season.",
        "It\u2019s important that the mud source not dry up so that the bees can easily use it.",
        "Monitor the mud source to ensure that it\u2019s still wet, either allowing rainfall to keep it moist, or adding water to the soil yourself.",
        "You can fill the hole using a hose, watering can, or simple glass of water, all depending on how big the mud source is.",
        "Make the mud a medium-consistency\u2014you don't want it to be super thick and difficult to move around, but it also shouldn't be dripping wet.",
        "Add additional soil to the mud source as the bees use it, if necessary.",
        "Buy a mason bee mud mix for an easy mud source.",
        "If you go online, you can find several different kinds of mud mixes specifically designed for bees.",
        "This option is good if you don\u2019t have access to soil, or just want an easy mud fix.",
        "Follow the directions on the box, most likely adding the mix to your soil to provide more clay.",
        "You'll need to add water to the soil and mud mix to make it the right consistency."
