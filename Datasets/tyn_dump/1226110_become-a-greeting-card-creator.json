Think about composition and balance, as these both make a huge impression on a potential buyer.

Along with the perfect message, consider how you\u2019ll say it\u2014will you use rhyme and meter or make the writing more casual and conversational? Will the message be long and poetic or short and punchy? For example, it probably wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to rhyme the message for a sympathy card. Instead a simple sympathy message could be \u201cYou\u2019re in our thoughts and our hearts.\u201d\nFor a birthday card, a touch of humor would suit the genre. A sample message from one fifty-year-old to another could be \u201cFifty looks good on us\u2014but then again, my eyes aren\u2019t what they used to be,\u201d with a funny illustration to keep the message light-hearted."

        "Avoid putting faces or people on your card.",
        "When shopping for a greeting card, people often picture the person they\u2019re buying for or themselves, and seeing a different face that doesn\u2019t match either person can subconsciously make a buyer turn away.",
        "Make the top third of the card really count.",
        "The top third is all customers will see when the card is on a rack.",
        "Try covering up the bottom of the card and seeing if the message or general feeling still comes across in the top third.",
        "Doing Freelance Work Come up with at least 20 strong designs.",
        "The more work you have to show, the better a company can see your range of ability.",
        "Amass a volume of work that really shows your skills and develops your ideas fully.",
        "Companies are usually very selective and end up picking only a small percentage of your work to publish, so it\u2019s good to bring lots of options.",
        "Some greeting card creators even suggest making up to 50-100 designs to submit.",
        "Create a portfolio of your best work.",
        "Companies will want to see examples of your work, so it\u2019s important to build a strong portfolio that showcases your range and abilities.",
        "If you want a physical portfolio to show people, compile your work in a binder of physical samples or photographs of your products.",
        "If you want to create a digital portfolio that you can easily send a link to, compile photographs or scans of your work on a website or blog.",
        "Make sure your digital portfolio is clean, simple, and easy to read.",
        "Follow the company\u2019s branding and and guidelines.",
        "What kind of cards does this company produce?",
        "What kind of humor do they look for?",
        "Make sure you have a solid understanding the company\u2019s identity and values in order to see if your style is a good fit.",
        "This way, you can better create cards they are likely to buy.",
        "You should also look into a company\u2019s specific guidelines on copy, artistic media, and submissions before submitting any work.",
        "Follow these guidelines carefully to ensure that your work will be considered.",
        "Submit your work to a company.",
        "Although large greeting card companies generally don't accept freelance submissions, there are many smaller companies that do, such as Oatmeal Studios, Avanti Press, and Moonlighting Cards.",
        "Follow their guidelines on how many designs to send in.",
        "Make sure to include a cover letter introducing yourself and asking them to consider your submission.",
        "Be prepared to wait.",
        "Greeting card companies often take a long time to respond, sometimes up to six months.",
        "Be patient and keep working while you wait to hear back about your submission.",
        "Receive payment for any accepted submissions.",
        "Payment generally comes with acceptance of your submission, so if your designs are accepted, you\u2019ll be paid right away.",
        "Generally companies will offer anywhere between $25-300 for an accepted submission.",
        "Working for an Established Company Focus your skillset on either art or writing.",
        "When working for an established company like Hallmark, you\u2019ll likely be either a writer or an artist.",
        "Sometimes the two positions collaborate, but often the writing and artwork is paired after being created independently.",
        "Focus on which skill is your strongest and develop it.",
        "Of course, companies are interested in a variety of skills so be sure to mention if you are experienced and talented in both areas.",
        "Start the application process by sending in your portfolio.",
        "If the company likes your portfolio, you will likely need to complete a set of exercises to test your writing ability.",
        "After this application stage, you may have several interviews and meetings before knowing if you got the job or not.",
        "Highlight your strengths during the interviewing process.",
        "If you have a strong sense of structure, rhyme, and meter, be sure to showcase it.",
        "You should also highlight if you have any formal training, such as courses in illustration or graphic design.",
        "Experience working independently in creative jobs is also helpful.",
        "Develop versatility as an artist or writer.",
        "Once you\u2019re hired, developing the ability to flexible and able to write a variety of cards is key.",

        "Starting Your Own Greeting Card Company Print your designs.",
        "If you choose to print your own designs, you\u2019ll need to choose from a variety of papers and finishes.",
        "Cards are generally made of a heavy card stock, such as 80 lb cover.",
        "You also need to decide if you prefer a matte, gloss, textured, or luster finish.",
        "Matte and textured generally mimic the look of original artwork best, particularly with watercolor illustrations.",
        "Choose the type of ink that best suits your work.",
        "Think about durability and quality when it comes to ink.",
        "Pigment-based inks last longer than dye-based inks, so this may be important for creating long-lasting, high-quality cards.",
        "Your ink may also depend on the printer you use.",
        "Unlike laserjet ink, inkjet ink is not waterproof, so it is more susceptible to smudging and damage.",

        "Decide if you want to make passive income.",
        "When choosing an online selling website, consider whether you want to make more passive or active income.",
        "Passive income means you put up a design and continually earn money from it.",
        "Websites like Society6 allow you to make mostly passive income, as you don't need to print or create any of the items yourself\u2014you create and format your designs, and then Society6 takes care of the production when someone purchases an item.",
        "Decide if active income is a better choice for you.",

        "Websites like Etsy are all about selling handmade products.",
        "Although you can sell digital files of your designs on Etsy and still earn passive income, selling physical copies or originals is more in line with the website\u2019s brand and goals.",
        "This process will take more time and work on your part, making it active income.",

        "Instagram and Pinterest are important tools for independent creators to utilize because they are largely visually oriented.",
        "Post pictures of your products, designs, and packaging to drum up interest and drive customers to your shop.",
