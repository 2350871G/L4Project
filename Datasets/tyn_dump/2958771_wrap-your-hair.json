    "text": " Preparing Hair for Wet Wraps Wash your hair. Use your regular shampoo and a deep conditioner. Starting with clean hair will make it easier to wrap your hair. Apply a leave-in conditioner or setting lotion to the hair from roots to ends. This should improve the PH balance of the hair. It can also help it to stay moisturized. Consider applying a natural oil, such as argon, jojoba or Moroccan oil, to each section individually. This is best for natural and very dry hair. Skip this step if your hair is already relaxed. Section Wrapping Part your hair into 2 or 4 sections. If you have a thick head of hair, you should use 4 sections. If your hair is already relaxed or straightened and dry, you should use 2 sections to keep the hair more uniform. Use a rat tail comb to ensure the sections are parted in straight lines along the scalp. Comb the first section on the bottom left side of your hair from roots to ends. Be sure to remove all tangles. You want to get the hair as straight and smooth as possible prior to wrapping. Comb each of the remaining sections individually. Work each section until it is smooth and free of tangles. You can use your alligator clips to keep the sections apart. Wrap the bottom left section around the base of your skull, right above your ear and around the top of your head. It should continue wrapping in a swirl pattern around the outside of your head until you reach the end. Make sure it stays straight in all areas. Comb the section and start the wrapping process again if it does not stay straight, smooth and detangled. Pin the wrapped section at the top with large alligator clips. You may need to add a pin to the hair at the nape of your neck or a few other places that feel loose; however, you should try to use as few clips or pins as you can, because they can crimp the hair. Repeat the wrap with the bottom right section, wrapping it around the base of the skull, above the left ear and around the top of the head. Clip it. Wrap the top left section around the right side of the head, below the 2 previous wraps, or above them, if need be. Clip it as necessary. Wrap the top right section around the left side of the head. Clip it as necessary. You should try to use between 4 and 6 clips.

This can help to keep the wrap intact. Place the trunk section of the pantyhose over your head. It should be tight but comfortable. Wrap the legs around to the base of the neck. Tie them in place. Drying a Wet Hair Wrap Use a hooded hair dryer on low for 45 minutes to 1 hour while your head is wrapped. If you don\u2019t have a hooded dryer, you can use a hand held blow dryer on medium with a dryer cap. This process will dry your hair while straightening it. Wait until the hair is completely dry to remove the wrap. Depending on the length of your hair, it may take several hours or more to dry completely.

You can keep it covered with a silk scarf until you are ready to style it. It is important to only use a silk scarf as this will prevent the hair from pulling or snagging during sleep. Removing Your Hair Wrap Do not remove the pantyhose and scarf immediately when you wake up. Keep the hair wrapped until you are ready to comb and style it as usual. Removing the hair wrap too early can cause your hair to get messed before you even start getting ready. Cover your head with a shower cap and shower. Then, wait until you are no longer in the humid bathroom and remove all the layers. The hot, damp environment of a shower can cause your hair to get wet and end up frizzy. Unwrap your hair by unpinning and unwrapping the hair sections. Comb the hair in the opposite direction that the hair was wrapped. Combing the hair back will help eliminate any annoying cowlicks that can come from wrapping hair.",
