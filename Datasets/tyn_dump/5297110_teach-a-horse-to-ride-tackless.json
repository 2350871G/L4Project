At the same time, inexperienced riders may fall off of their horse when they first try riding tackless, so it's important that you develop your general riding skills before you try riding with no tack. Not all horses have the right build or temperament to ride tackless and their joints and muscles may be injured as a result. Be sure that you're willing to take these chances before you commit to riding tackless. Of course, by training yourself and your horse to ride tackless, you will also minimize the chances of either of you getting hurt. So, don't let fear dictate whether you try riding tackless! You can get a sense of what it's like to ride tackless by riding in the saddle but with the stirrups dropped. Either drape the stirrups over the saddle horn or just keep your feet out of the irons. Try riding this way at a walk, trot, and canter."

If your horse has trouble doing this, ride it around an enclosed space for a few minutes at a steady trot to help it find its rhythm. You may need to train your horse in basic controls and riding speed before you attempt to ride it tackless."

Repeat this process until your horse is able to stop in response to you shifting your body weight and applying slight pressure. Your goal should be to be able to get the horse to stop without actually having to pull on the reins. The easiest way to praise the horse for stopping is to release all physical pressure and then verbally praise it while scratching along its neck and withers."

Lean inwards into each turn so that the horse also associates the command to turn with the shift in your body weight. If your horse has no experience with a neck rope, start by using both a bridle and a neck rope at the same time. When you turn your horse using the bridle, push the neck rope against its neck as well. Repeat this process until the horse associates the pressure of the neck rope with turning."
