If you do not have access to running water, then you can also use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Washing your hands with water is best, but using hand sanitizer is better than nothing. If you are disinfecting someone else\u2019s wound, then you may also want to put on a pair of clean, disposable vinyl or latex gloves. However, this is not absolutely necessary."

Do not remove the gauze or bandage until you are certain that the bleeding has stopped or you may pull away tissue and cause the bleeding to start again. Elevate it above the level of your heart. This will direct the blood flow away from the injury point. If you can't raise the wound, apply pressure to a pressure point (an artery above the injury) on the wrist, bicep, at the top of the thigh, or behind the knee. If the bleeding doesn't stop after 10 minutes of pressure and elevation, seek medical assistance. Call emergency services if you can't get transportation to the emergency room."

Avoid getting soap in the wound, as it could cause irritation. Rinse the area with clean water and dry it with a clean towel or cloth. Alternatively, you could clean the wound with salt water and a piece of gauze. Dip the gauze in the salt water and gently blot the wound with it. If any dirt or debris is in the wound, try to remove it with a pair of sterilized tweezers that have been cleaned with rubbing alcohol. Do not use your fingers. Seek medical help if any dirt, debris, or other object is too deep for you to reach or if the wound is deep and has an object inside of it."
