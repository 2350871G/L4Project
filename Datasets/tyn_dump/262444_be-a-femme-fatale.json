Don\u2019t think that worshipping them will do the trick. Though it\u2019s good to care for other people, too, don\u2019t ever stop taking care of yourself because you think someone else is more important. Be fascinating. Femme fatales are more than just pretty faces. They have charming personalities that are endlessly fascinating. If you want to be a femme fatale, then you have to do your homework. You have to read the papers, be up to date on politics and pop culture, master another language, or just do whatever you can to make yourself an interesting person to talk to. The men will like more about you than just your mystery and your allure, and they\u2019ll be drawn to how fascinating you are, too. This doesn\u2019t mean you have to talk too much or spout off all the facts you know. It does mean that you can be sharp, quick-witted, and make yourself stand out during a conversation as someone who knows the score. Being fascinating isn\u2019t just about having knowledge; it\u2019s about knowing how to keep a person\u2019s interest, and how to find something exciting to talk about. Every person is different, and you should be aware of what makes a person tick before you start talking. Have a sense of humor. You don\u2019t need to be dark and serious all the time if you want to be a femme fatale. You can learn to laugh at yourself and to have a quick wit and the ability to make clever banter to keep a conversation going. Some of the greatest femme fatales are known for their funny and incisive comments, such as Ingrid Bergman\u2019s words, \u201c\u201cHappiness is good health and a bad memory.\u201d Work on looking at the world through a clever lens, and don\u2019t think that you have to be stone serious to be a femme fatale. In fact, your sense of humor should be one of the things that makes you fascinating as a femme fatale. Make the most of it. If a man says something funny to you, don\u2019t just laugh and say, \u201cThat\u2019s funny.\u201d Instead, fire back with an equally funny comment. Be independent. To be a true femme fatale, you have to depend on yourself and yourself only. Don\u2019t spend your time pining away for men who you don\u2019t really care about, or waiting for your friends to call you up so you can have a good time. You have to make your own fun in this world, and you have to be happy being on your own if you want to be a femme fatale. Work to have your own interests, whether it\u2019s singing or belly dancing, and make sure you have plenty of time for personal growth and self-improvement. True femme fatales don\u2019t need anyone else to be happy. You can form meaningful relationships with people, but you should always make time for yourself. Even if you\u2019re dating the man of your dreams, you can\u2019t let yourself get too co-dependent. You have to have your own goals and dreams, and not let anyone get in the way of them. Don\u2019t let a man change your ideas about your career or what you\u2019re capable of. Walking the Walk Speak in a seductive voice. Make your voice sound low and attractive, but not creepy. Work on speaking in a softer, lower, more seductive way. Don\u2019t mumble, and make sure you articulate your words without sounding too formal. Avoid saying \u201cum\u201d or \u201cuh\u201d a lot and talk with conviction. A femme fatale doesn\u2019t like to repeat herself. Work on sounding like you know what you\u2019re talking about and letting those words out in the sexiest way possible. Listen to Scarlett Johansson or Joan Crawford for an example of this kind of voice. Hang out in mysterious places. You don\u2019t need to go anywhere that doesn\u2019t make you feel safe, but you should spend time in more interesting, less expected places. This is the best way to meet more interesting people, after all. Try an obscure, artsy coffee shop, a clandestine nightclub or speakeasy, or even a unique antique shop. Don\u2019t make it obvious when you enter or exit a new place, and work on slinking in and out of rooms. Pick places with darker lighting to help maintain your dark, mysterious image. It\u2019s hard to be a femme fatale under fluorescent lights. Don\u2019t do the expected. You can find a place you like, but you don\u2019t need to be a regular anywhere, or you\u2019ll become a bit too predictable. Watch old movies for inspiration. Femme fatales made a name for themselves in the 1940s, so watching some films featuring these seductive ladies can help you get an idea of how to look and act. Mildred Pierce is a great starter. The film noir classics of the 40s can help you get inspiration, such as movies like Double Indemnity (1944), Naked City (1948) and Kiss of Death (1947). Watch as many as you can and learn. You can also check out more modern femme fatales, such as Fiona Apple in the \u201cCriminal\u201d music video or Curve in \u201cChinese Burn.\u201d But don\u2019t let these images define you\u2014each femme fatale puts her own spin on her image. Have a signature drink. Femme Fatales are known for having a signature drink that they order whenever they\u2019re out. It doesn\u2019t matter what it is, but it should be consistent and it should make people impressed by your decisiveness. It can be a glass of merlot, a Dark and Stormy, a whisky on the rocks, or even just a glass of iced tea with a sprig of mint in it. You have to order it with decisiveness and you shouldn\u2019t waste time looking over a drink menu, either. You can avoid overly girly or fruity drinks like a Cosmo, Sex on the Beach, or a pi\u00f1a colada, if you want to be taken seriously. You may also want to avoid drinks that are known for getting people drunk as fast as possible, such as Margaritas. Be a lady. To be a true femme fatale, you should be a real lady to boot. Treat yourself and the people around you with respect, have dignified manners, and make sure you look pretty self-possessed and put together. A true lady doesn\u2019t get too drunk in public, she doesn\u2019t curse up a blue streak, and she doesn\u2019t reveal too much personal information to someone she\u2019s just met. Just carry yourself with dignity and poise and the rest will follow. To be a true lady, you have to be proper within reason. You don\u2019t have to be all buttoned up and demure, but you shouldn\u2019t push people around, leave your trash everywhere, or burp without excusing yourself, either. Stand tall with good posture. Ladies don\u2019t tend to slouch or sit in an undignified way. Having good posture shows that you have confidence and poise. Don\u2019t open up too fast. Femme fatales are known for their shrouds of mystery. You can open up to a man little by little, but you should make him work to get to know you. Don\u2019t tell him every little thing there is to know about your childhood, your five favorite foods, or tell him every little detail of your school experience. Instead, reveal the information about yourself little by little, making a man feel like it\u2019s a privilege to get to know you. Take your time. When the opportunity presents itself, you can talk about growing up in Seattle or your love for archery. But don\u2019t put it all out there all at once, or your element of mystery will fade away. Make sure the man is telling you about himself, too. You don\u2019t want to be the only one who is opening up. Don\u2019t let a man determine your value. A femme fatale doesn\u2019t sit at home crying because her man won\u2019t call her back. She doesn\u2019t get down on herself if a careless man makes a condescending comment to her. She doesn\u2019t let anyone tell her who she is. You can have fun dating men, toying with them, seducing them, or even falling in love with them, but you can\u2019t let them determine your self-worth. True femme fatales know that no one can get rid of the power they posses. True femme fatales have a healthy dose of confidence. Work on loving the person who you are and accepting the things you can\u2019t change about yourself. If you\u2019re uncertain about who you are, then it\u2019ll be easier for a man to get you down. If a guy hurt your feelings, take some time to let your emotions out, talk about it to a friend, and then work on moving on. Don\u2019t be in denial about how you feel and let it keep you from fully recovering. Once you deal with your feelings, you can kick those feelings of pain and inadequacy to the curb.",
