Cooking the chicken to a temperature of 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C) is the surest way to kill any bacteria found on it. As long as you cook it properly, you don't need to rinse it."

Then, slice through the breast bone, separating the two halts of the chicken. Remove excess fat and bone by cutting through the point at which the rib bones meet the breast meat, separating the back bones and discarding them, or using them for stock. Also remove the breast bone and the cartilage that connects them. Alternatively, some find it much easier to start with the chicken breast-up. With your finger, press into the center of the breast to find the hard cartilage and insert the knife to one side of it. Use the point of your knife to start, and then the flat of it to break through the front, separating the halves of the chicken in much the same way, then removing the excess rib bone you don't want."

Quartering the Chicken Separate the two legs from the chicken. Slice along each leg joint using a butcher\u2019s knife, cutting through the skin. This should loosen but not completely remove the leg. Pull the legs away from the body, rotating the drumstick until the ball joint of the leg pops out, then make another cut below the ball joints to completely remove each leg and thigh. Divide each leg into a drumstick and thigh piece. Place the chicken leg on a cutting board with the skin side down. Use a butcher\u2019s knife to find the notch at the top of the drumstick where it meets the thigh and cut between them to separate. Alternatively, you can leave the leg and thigh together for a larger piece if you wish. Remove the breasts, keeping the wings attached.
