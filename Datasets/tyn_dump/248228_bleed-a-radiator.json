Thus, when you turn on the heat, either the entire radiator will feel cold or the top of the radiator will feel cold while the bottom feels warm. Unfortunately, a cold radiator can also signify other problems. Before proceeding, check for these other common radiator issues listed below. If none seem to fit, your radiator probably needs a simple bleeding. Be careful - radiators can get quite hot. Protect your hands when you're feeling a radiator for warmth. If you have multiple radiators in your house and all of them are cold or lukewarm, you probably have a larger issue with your heating system - your water heater may be malfunctioning or you may have a buildup of sludge or sediment somewhere in your heating system (see: How to Flush a Water Heater.) If your radiator problem is accompanied by an accumulation of water beneath the radiator, your radiator has a leak. Try turning your heat off, then tightening the nut(s) on your radiator's inlet valve. If this doesn't fix the problem, the nut may be corroded - replace them or call a professional. If the radiators on the upper floors of your house aren't heating up but the radiators on the lower floors are, your heating system may not be operating at a high enough pressure to get hot water to the top floors of your house."

Radiator keys, cheap metal implements designed for opening and closing radiator valves, are available at most hardware stores. Find a radiator key that's the correct size for your valve or, alternatively, search your tool chest for a small wrench or other tool that's the right size to turn the valve. Some modern radiators are equipped with valves that are designed to be turned with a simple flathead screwdriver. Before proceeding, make sure you have a radiator key, a screwdriver, a wrench or some combination of implements so that you'll be able to open the valves on  every radiator in your house.

Especially short or tall houses may require lesser or greater boiler pressure, respectively. If your boiler has an automatic fill system, your boiler should maintain a pressure reading of about 12-15 psi without any work on your part.
