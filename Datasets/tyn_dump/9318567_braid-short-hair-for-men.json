        "Tighten the braid by pulling on both ends of your hair.",
        "Continue to twist your hair to the back of your head.",
        "Grab more hair and add it to the braid after every twist.",
        "Continue to twist the strands over each other and work towards the back of your head along the part that you created.",
        "Every time you make another twist, you should grab a little more hair along the part so that you can extend the braid back.",
        "The more hair you grab, the thicker your braid will be.",
        "Continue twisting the braid to the back of your head.",
        "Continue twisting your hair all the way to the back of your head until you don't have any more hair to grab.",
        "The braid should be along the part and run across the entire top of your head.",
        "Secure the end of the braid with a rubber band if necessary.",
        "Depending on your hair's texture, you may need a rubber band to secure the braid.",
        "If your braided hair tends to unravel on its own, take a small hair rubber band and wrap it around the end of the braid until the rubber band is tight.",
        "Braid the rest of your hair.",
        "Create as many braids as you want over your head until you're satisfied.",
        "Look in the mirror and see if the braids look good.",
        "It may take some practice until you can braid your hair the way that you want.",
        "Making Cornrows Grab and separate three portions of hair along the part.",
        "Separate the hair into three small but equal pieces--a left portion, a middle portion, and a right portion.",
        "This hair will make up your braid.",
        "Cross the left section under the middle section.",
        "Once you do this the left section will become the middle section because you crossed it under.",
        "Continue to hold all three sections separately with your fingertips and make sure that they don't come undone.",
        "Cross the right section under the middle section.",
        "Once you cross the right section under the middle section, the braid should start to form.",
        "Pull on the ends of your hair to tighten the braid.",
        "Continue to braid from the front to the back of your head.",
        "Repeat the process and grab more hair as you continue braiding.",
        "Make sure that the amount of hair you're adding to the braid is the same each time so that it looks uniform.",
        "Tie a rubber band around the end of the braid if necessary.",
        "Tying a rubber band around your hair will hold the braid in place and ensure that it won't come undone.",
        "Wrap the rubber band enough times so that it's tight on your braids.",
        "You may not need to use rubber bands if your braids stay in tact without them.",
        "Braid the rest of your hair.",
        "To get the traditional cornrow look, you'll want to create several braids that run across the top of your head.",
        "Each braid should be placed \u20442\u20131 inch (1.3\u20132.5 cm) apart from one another.",
        "Once you're done, look in the mirror and make sure that the braids are straight.",
        "Creating Different Styles Make wavy parts for wavy braids.",
        "Instead of creating straight parts, try to create wavy parts by moving the teeth of the comb side to side as you create the part.",
        "Then, braid your hair as you normally would along the part.",
        "This will dictate the shape of the braids and can create a cool, wavy effect.",
        "Get creative with your part placement.",
        "Braided hair isn't limited to cornrows that run from front to back.",
        "Once you become proficient at tying braids, try to mix up your part placement.",
        "Create parts that run horizontally across your head instead of front to back, or create parts that make shapes on your head for an interesting style.",
        "For example, you can create zig-zag braids or braids that form an X.",
        "Create a man bun if you have longer hair on the top of your head.",
        "If your head isn't entirely covered in braids, comb your non-braided hair back and tie it to the end of the braid with a rubber band.",
        "This will create a topknot, or man bun on the top of your head and will give your braid a fresh and trendy look.",
        "This style works best for hair that's longer than 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm)."
