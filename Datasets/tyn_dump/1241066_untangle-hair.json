Part your hair with your fingers or a wide-tooth comb, then separate it into 4-6 sections that are each about 2 in (5.1 cm) wide. You can either tie the other sections back or use a clip to hold them out of the way.This is especially important if you have thick or curly hair. If your hair is thin and straight, you may be able to work in 2 sections, or none at all."

Gently pull down and loosen any knots or tangles, starting near the tips of your hair and working back towards the roots. Work slowly and patiently, taking on one tangle at a time. If you have any particularly bad or painful knots, you can also cut them out by snipping as close to the knot as possible with sharp scissors. Remember that, depending on the size of the knot, these uneven tips might be noticeable, especially if they are close to your roots. This option works best if the knot is near the ends of your hair.Did you know? Detangling with your fingers first allows you to pinpoint and loosen any problem tangles before you go in with a comb.

The tangles will also grow and snarl even more, so be sure to tackle the tips first, then slowly move up. If you have tough tangles near the roots of your hair, push them down to about mid-length before combing through them. This will decrease the stress on the follicle.

For looser curls, use a brush with wide-set boar bristles to help smooth your hair and keep it frizz-free. If you have tighter curls, use a detangling brush with flexible bristles to conserve your curl pattern without causing frizz."
