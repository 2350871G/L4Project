You can also tie the cinder block to the tent leg using rope or bungee cord, while still attaching rope to the top frame.

Cinder blocks can be a convenient method of weighing down your tents at home. Consider covering them with old towels or sheets so people don\u2019t scrape themselves if they bump into them.

Thread rope through the holes, tie a knot around the weights, then another knot at the top of your tent frame to attach the weights to it. If you are using your tent at a public event, check with your event coordinator before using exercise weights as tent weights. Filling Large Buckets with Sand, Gravel, or Water Take 4-8 5 US gal (19 L) buckets to where you\u2019re setting up your tent.

These of course will not be able to be emptied when you\u2019re finished with them, but they can serve as permanently available weights for whenever you need them. Attach a bungee cord or rope to the handle of each bucket. Clip a bungee cord, or tie a sturdy knot with rope, to each of your bucket handles. If you\u2019re using rope, it will need to be long enough to reach the top frame of your canopy with a knot tied there. A bungee cord will need to be able to stretch that far as well.

        "Attach \u20448 inch (1.6 cm) eyebolts to the caps with nuts and bolts.",
        "Insert 1 eyebolt into each hole that you drilled.",
        "Twist a \u20448 inch (1.6 cm) nut onto the eyebolt on either side of the cap to sandwich your eyebolt in, place a washer on the inside end, and then twist a bolt on that end to secure it.",
        "Glue the caps with eyebolts onto the PVC pipes.",
        "Most PVC glues have a brush inside the cannister, and require you to use a purple primer liquid, sold near the glue itself, before brushing on the glue.",
        "Follow all instructions on the PVC glue as you brush the glue on and attach caps to what will be the tops of each of your pipes.",
        "Allow your glue to dry for the length of time determined by the glue instructions.",
        "Mix some concrete and fill each pipe.",
        "Use a 5 US gal (19 L) bucket to mix your dry cement with water according to your cement package directions.",
        "Keep in mind that the cement starts to set quickly, so you\u2019ll need to work quickly.",
        "When each pipe is full, stand it against a wall on the eyebolt to let the concrete dry.",
        "This step can benefit from the help of a friend.",
        "When the concrete is mixed, 1 person can fill the pipes with a small trowel while the other person holds the pipe upright and occasionally taps it on the ground to make sure the concrete is moving toward the bottom.",
        "Consider mixing your cement in 2 separate batches, so that you aren\u2019t as rushed to use up all the cement at once before it starts setting.",
        "Drill a small hole in each of the bottom caps.",
        "The caps for the bottoms of your pipes will need a small hole in them to allow air to escape when gluing the caps on.",
        "Wearing eye protection and gloves, use a small drill bit to drill a hole into these plain caps.",
        "Allow the concrete to dry and glue a cap bottom on each end.",
        "Allow the concrete inside your pipes to dry completely for a few hours.",
        "Take the unattached cap bottoms and your PVC glue and primer, and glue these caps to the bottoms of your pipes.",
        "Allow them to dry according to the glue instructions.",
        "Your weights are now complete.",
        "Hang onto them until you need them for your assembled tent.",
        "Connect each weight to your tent frame with bungee cord or rope.",
        "To attach your weights to your assembled tent, clip a bungee cord or tie a rope around the eyebolts.",
        "Take the other end and clip or tie it to the tent frame at the top corner near the leg of your tent, giving enough length to the cord or rope so that the weight hangs near or on the ground.",
        "Do this to all 4 corners of your tent.",
        "Some people also like to tie the weights to the legs down near the ground with rope or Velcro strips, so that they don\u2019t swing around or become a tripping hazard."
