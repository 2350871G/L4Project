Prepare a very very sharp knife or box cutter or Stanley knife or razor blade (please use care with any of these tools). Clean the tool of your choice by dipping it into boiling water or by dipping it into rubbing alcohol. Locate the main veins on the begonia leaf and cut from the edge of the leaf all the way back to where the stem once was. You will want to cut in between two main veins. Your cuttings should look like triangles. Get a container with a lid (take away containers work best). Put 4 holes in the bottom and 4 holes in the side near the bottom of the container. Fill your container just under half way with peat moss. Make sure the peat moss is moist but not soggy.
