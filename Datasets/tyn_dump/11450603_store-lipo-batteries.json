Insert the balance plug into the port on the charging unit and wait for a reading. The balance plug is a white plug connected to several colorful wires coming out of the battery. You can also use a plain volt meter if your charger doesn\u2019t have a volt reader. Take the positive wire of the volt meter and connect it to one end of the balance plug, then connect the negative wire to the opposite side. Hold both wires on the plug for a few seconds until the volt meter produces a reading."
