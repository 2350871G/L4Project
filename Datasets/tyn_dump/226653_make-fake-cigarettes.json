Then, very gently remove the paper tube from the pencil and set the pencil to the side. If you use too much glue, you could end up with a cigarette that looks lumpy on one side, making it much more noticeably fake. This is also why you should avoid using liquid glue."

You can use a cigarette roller instead of rolling the paper with your hands if you wish, but be sure to buy one that is purposefully made for the cigarette size you are going for. You can skip this step if you have pre-made cigarette filters, which can make the cigarette appear more genuine as pre-made filters have an orange color and are made to be used in real cigarette rolling."
