The incision you made allows you to easily break apart the shell all the way along the middle. Keep the meat inside the shell for boiling and serving. Cooking the Lobster Place a large pot filled with water on the stove. Fill the pot 2/3 full with water to help prevent boiling over.

Most lobster tails require between 5 and 12 minutes to cook all the way through. Depending on the heat level and how full the pot is, it may begin to boil over. Turn down the heat if this happens. Poke the lobster meat with a fork. The lobster tails are ready when the meat is white and has a tender texture. The shells should have a bright red hue to them, and appear nearly separate from the meat. If the lobster is not ready, do not remove from the water. It is important to cook the lobster all the way through. Set the lobster tails in a colander or strainer.
