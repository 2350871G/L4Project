You can buy tear-away, wash-away, or cut-away stabilizer depending on whether or not you can wash the embroidered fabric. Buy the stabilizer from a craft store. If you're embroidering a large project, apply the stabilizer to the entire piece of fabric or cut it down to size. Spray adhesive on the fabric and secure the template to it. Spray a temporary fabric adhesive evenly across the surface of the fabric. Place a printed template with your letters on the adhesive and press it down firmly. The paper will stick to the fabric. If you don't have spray adhesive, you can pin the paper in place. Load your machine with an embroidery needle and thread. Insert an embroidery needle and secure it to the sewing machine. Wind and thread your choice of embroidery thread through the machine. Test the size of the stitches on a scrap of fabric, if desired. If you'd like to ensure that the machine stitches are as long and wide as you'd like, load a scrap piece of fabric. Embroider a practice letter or two and make any adjustments. Hoop the fabric and stabilizer. Take an embroidery hoop that will fit all of the letters you're embroidering and open it. Place the fabric on the hoop so the stabilizer is on the bottom. Lay the top of the hoop over the fabric and tighten it in place. The fabric should be taut between the hoop. Hold the embroidery hoop as you machine stitch along the template. You'll need to hold the hoop so the first few stitches on your template are secured. Move the hoop to machine embroider the letters on your template. Begin at 1 end of a letter and stitch the outline or fill in the letter before moving on to the next letter. Remember to move the hoop instead of pulling on the fabric. Cut the thread and back stitch the ends. Once you've finished embroidering the letters on your template, lift the needle up and pull the thread out. Pull away the paper template and cut the thread to leave a 4 in (10-cm) tail. Thread a needle and weave the end into the last letter using the back stitch.",
