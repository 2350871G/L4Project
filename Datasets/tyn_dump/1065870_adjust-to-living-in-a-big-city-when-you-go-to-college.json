If you are going to be living on campus, you have to think about living with other people, sharing all of your stuff, and especially sharing your personal space. If you decide that you are going to be living off campus, you must consider if you are again going to live with roommates, or if you are going to front the bill yourself. If you do live by yourself, it will be harder to adjust to the city if you are alone all the time."

In a small town, there is not that many jobs to come by, and usually you are in that job for many years. Now there is a really fast turnover rate for many places.

You might not need your own car when you move to the city. Usually you have to drive quite a distance to get to the nearest store, but now they are all going to be in walking distance, or at least most of them are. And like it as said before, there is even public transportation to get you places. You can save a lot of money by not taking your car with you.

You have had the same teacher as all your siblings, and maybe even your parents. Now you move to a city and you might meet one person one day and never see them again. Try to be friendly and nice to everyone you meet, you never know when you are going to see them again, and if you do, it\u2019s best to leave a good impression. To make more friends, be outgoing, go to places you wouldn\u2019t normally go, eat foods you\u2019ve never tried, and be adventurous. You will never make friends if you sit at home all the time; you have to put yourself out there, even if it makes you out of your comfort zone."
