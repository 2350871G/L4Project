The distance between the lift and hook should be about 12\u201d less than the length of your ladder. Attach a ladder hook to the ceiling. Find a ceiling joist with a stud finder. Using your ladder measurements, place the hook close enough to the lift for the ladder to reach it. Drill a hole and install the hook. Hang your ladder.
