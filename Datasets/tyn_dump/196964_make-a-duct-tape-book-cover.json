        "Keep your book open with the inside of the front cover visible.",
        "Tear off a few strips of duct tape that are taller than your book.",
        "Aim to make them 2 to 4 inches (5.08 to 10.16 centimeters) taller than your book.",

        "Fold the excess back onto the front of the cover.",
        "Trim off any extra at the top and bottom.",
        "This will make your cover stronger and prevent wear and tear.",

        "Tear off more strips of duct tape.",
