        "Follow the instructions above to melt the wax.",
        "As soon as it has melted completely, carefully pour the wax into the hollow left by the sand.",
        "Wear gloves when pouring hot wax.",
        "Let the wax set.",
        "Depending on the type of wax and the size of your hand, this can take anywhere from 2 to 8 hours, but leaving it overnight is a good idea just in case.",
        "Remove the candle.",
        "Once the wax is set, you can dig out the sand around it, or place a plastic bag over the mouth of the bucket and slowly tip the whole thing over.",
        "You may need to trim the wax hand if it's seeped out of the original hollow, or scrape it slightly to uncover the wick.",
        "Once that's done, your hand candle is complete."
