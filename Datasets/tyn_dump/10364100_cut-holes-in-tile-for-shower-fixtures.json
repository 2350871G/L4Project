Making a Hole with a Drill Bit, Chisel, and Hammer Drill holes around the circle with 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) masonry drill bit. Place a piece of tape over the circle. If you can't see it very well, mark the hole on the tape, too. Drill holes close together all around the circle. The tape helps your bit gain traction.

If you didn't chisel out the edges, keep tapping around the inside edges, as it will take longer to break the circle free. The edges will be rough, but they should be covered by your fixture. Cutting a Hole with a Coping Saw Drill a pilot hole along the edge of the circle. Place a piece of tape on the edge of the circle you've drawn. The tape will help give your bit traction. Use a masonry drill bit to make a hole right on the edge of the circle. Keep the drill at a low speed and use light pressure. Before drilling, make sure your drill isn't set to use the hammer action if it has it. This hole will allow you to put the blade of the coping saw through the tile, so measure the blade to make sure the drill bit is large enough to make a hole this size. Clamp the tile in place on the edge of a worktable. Hang where you want to cut the hole off the edge of the table, and clamp down the the tile by the edge using a clamp. This will hold it in place while you use the saw. Take the blade off on one side of the coping saw. Turn the wing nut on one side of the saw. Slide the blade out on that side. Be careful not to cut yourself on the blade as you slide it out. Make sure you're using a blade for ceramic tile, which you can get at most hardware stores. You can use pliers to pull the blade out or wear protective gloves to protect yourself. Slide the blade through the hole. Pass the open side of the blade down through the hole to meet the coping saw on the other side. Put the blade back into the coping saw and turn the wingnut to lock it in place. Saw the hole out with the blade. Move the saw up and down as you curve around the circle you want to cut. Keep going around until you've cut out the complete hole and the circle falls out. Remove the blade the same way you did before and slide it out of the hole. Using a Hole Saw Place a piece of masking tape across where you're drilling. The drill may slip around on tile, as the surface is glossy. Laying down a piece of masking tape helps the drill get traction on the tile.
