Turn off the heat as soon as you see small bubbles beginning to form in the bottom of the pot. Don\u2019t allow the water to boil, as this can cause the wine bottle crack. Choose a pot that can hold at least 2 litres (0.53 US gal). Fill up your wine bottle with the hot water. Use a heat-proof jug with a narrow spout to transfer the hot water from the pot into the wine bottle. Fill the bottles to the top of the labels.
