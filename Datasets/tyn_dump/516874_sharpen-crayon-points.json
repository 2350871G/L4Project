Put the tip of the crayon in and let it grind away until it is sharp. It is quick and takes less effort than the method above, if you are able to obtain this item. With a Manual Crayon Sharpener Purchase a manual crayon sharpener.  Sharpen the crayon the same way you would sharpen a pencil in a manual sharpener.  With a Knife Get a knife and crayon.
