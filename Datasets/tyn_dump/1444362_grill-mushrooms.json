This recipe works with any type of mushrooms; however, button mushrooms tend to stay on the kebab skewers best. If you don\u2019t have metal skewers use wooden skewers instead. Make sure to soak the skewers in water for 20 minutes before threading the mushrooms onto the kebabs. Buy skewers from a cooking store or a supermarket."

    "text": " Making Grilled Mushroom Kebabs Thread 4 mushrooms onto a metal skewer. Poke the skewer through the longest part of the mushroom. For example, if the mushroom is short and wide, thread the skewer width-ways through the mushroom. Alternatively, if the mushroom round, or long and skinny, thread the skewer length-ways through the mushroom. Leave a gap between each mushroom to help them cook evenly. This recipe works with any type of mushrooms; however, button mushrooms tend to stay on the kebab skewers best. If you don\u2019t have metal skewers use wooden skewers instead. Make sure to soak the skewers in water for 20 minutes before threading the mushrooms onto the kebabs. Buy skewers from a cooking store or a supermarket. Mix the garlic salt, melted butter, and dried dill weed in a bowl. Measure \u20444 cup (59 mL) of melted butter, 1/2 teaspoon (0.5 grams) of dried dill weed, and 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 grams) of garlic salt into a bowl. Use a spoon to mix the ingredients until they are thoroughly combined. If you don\u2019t like garlic, use regular salt instead. This mixture helps to marinate the mushrooms while they cook. Brush the marinade over the mushrooms with a pastry brush. Dip the pastry brush into the marinade and evenly coat the mushrooms with the liquid. Turn the kebabs over and then cover the other side of the mushrooms with the marinade. Continue to brush the mushrooms until you have used up all the liquid. If you don\u2019t have a pastry brush, evenly pour the marinade over the kebabs instead. Place the kebabs onto the grill for 5 minutes at medium-high heat. Spread the kebabs across the grill so that they aren\u2019t touching each other. This will help them to cook evenly. If you smell the mushrooms burning, turn the heat down. If you are grilling the mushrooms in the oven, set the temperature to 375 \u00b0F (191 \u00b0C). Always be careful when cooking on a grill to avoid burns. Turn the mushroom kebabs over and grill them for another 5 minutes. Use a pair of metal tongs to gently turn each kebab over. This helps to brown both sides of the kebabs and ensures that the middle of the mushrooms cook evenly. If the mushrooms haven\u2019t browned, leave them on the grill for another 2 minutes. Enjoy the mushrooms hot with your favourite sides. Mushrooms taste best when they are fresh off the grill, as they tend to go soggy once they cool down. Enjoy the mushrooms by themselves, or serve them with a salad, meat, or vegetables. Grilling the Mushrooms in Foil Cut 0.125 pounds (57 g) of butter into cubes. Use a sharp knife to cut the butter into 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) cubes. The butter will give the mushrooms a deliciously creamy and buttery taste. If you don\u2019t have any butter, use margarine instead. Place the mushrooms on a 15 inches (38 cm) square of aluminium foil. Use a pair of scissors to cut the aluminium foil. The foil will help to keep the mushrooms nice and juicy while they cook. Place 12 ounces (340 g) of mushrooms onto the middle of the foil square in a pile. If you are making a double recipe of mushrooms, use a larger piece of foil. Sprinkle the salt, pepper and butter over the mushrooms. Dot the cubes of butter evenly over the mushrooms. This will melt when the mushrooms are grilled and give the mushrooms a delicious buttery coating. Sprinkle a pinch of salt and pepper over the pile of mushrooms to enhance the flavours. If you want to add extra flavour to the mushroom, use garlic salt instead of regular salt. Wrap the foil around the mushrooms to create a bundle. Pull the corners of the aluminium foil into the centre of the square. Hold all the corners in one hand and twist them together. This will secure the mushrooms inside the foil parcel. If the foil doesn\u2019t completely cover the mushrooms, wrap another piece of foil over the bundle to cover the gap. The mushrooms will be stacked on top of each other inside the package. Grill the mushrooms over medium heat for 40 minutes. Place the foil parcel onto the grill and pull down the lid. Set a timer to remind you to remove the mushrooms from the grill after 40 minutes. If you are grilling other food, this can be placed onto the grill at the same time. If you don\u2019t have a grill, set your oven to the grill function and turn the heat up to 375 \u00b0F (191 \u00b0C). Take care when cooking on a hot grill to avoid burns. Open the foil parcel with oven mitts and then enjoy the mushrooms. Transfer the mushrooms from the grill to a plate. Use a pair of oven mitts to unwrap the foil parcel. This will help to avoid burns from the hot foil. Enjoy the mushrooms on their own or with your favourite meat and vegetables.
