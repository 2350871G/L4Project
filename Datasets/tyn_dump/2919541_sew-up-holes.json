If the fabric is soft or thin, you may use any needle \u2013 though you might want to use a more delicate needle. Cotton, nylon, silk, jute, mixed fabric, and any other thin, soft fabric is better stitched with  a lighter needles. The needle can be as short as 1-2 inches, or longer as needed. If you use a thick needle\u2014approximately 1 mm in thickness\u2014it may leave visible holes in the fabric. You may use a finger cap to prevent being poked by the needle while stitching. Opt for a thicker needle to avoid breaking any needles. Use a solid board to push the needle through while stitching if your finger hurts. Some thick fabrics like denim need pushing against a hard surface."

The in-and-out sewing motion will take up a lot of thread, and you'll also need a bit more thread than the needle's length in order to tie the final knot.

For consistency, try to keep the distance between each stitch to about 2 mm. If the hole is especially frayed, try reinforcing with a liquid seam sealant before you start stitching. This can help make the fix more sustainable. If the cloth is too tight, a stitch may tear again once you wear the garment. Try adding another layer of a piece of a cloth beneath the hole, and then stitching that cloth for added strength. Try stitching a button to the area, if it goes with the fabric.

        "Hold the cloth and stitch it so that the frayed end is folded inwards.",
        "Fold the cloth one or two times, then stitch it \"shut\" to prevent the cloth from tearing again.",
        "Finish the job.",
        "Stretch and press the cloth.",
        "Take care that the thread does not get tangled midway through the stitch.",
        "Press the stitched area between your fingers.",
        "Then, run through the stitch to remove air gaps or unevenness of the cloth.",
        "To finish the job, make a knot and snip the thread.",
        "Patching a Hole Try using an iron-on patch for heavier fabrics.",
        "You can simply lay the patch over the hole, then iron it flat with enough heat that the patch binds to the fabric.",
        "Make sure to reinforce an iron-on patch with stitching around the edges.",
        "Trim the square corners to a rounded shape before ironing them onto the garment.",
        "Both the stitching and the corner trimming will increase the useful life of the patch.",
        "Iron-on patches are suitable for heavier fabrics such as denim and canvas.",
        "However, they may distort the shape of thinner fabrics.",
        "Make the patch discreet.",
        "If the hole is in a visible part of the garment, prepare the self patch from the inside.",
        "If this isn't possible, purchase fabric as close in color to the garment as possible in a fabric with the same properties.",
        "Alternately, pick a patch that stands out.",
        "For some, patched clothing is a stylistic choice.",
        "Hand-sew a patch for thinner fabrics.",
        "First, trim the frayed threads and treat the hole's edges with seam sealant.",
        "Make two patches: one with any fabric for the bottom, and one with the matching/self fabric for the top patch.",
        "Treat the edges of the bottom patch with seam sealant.",
        "Then, turn a small amount of fabric at the edge of your top patch, and iron this folded edge in place.",
        "Use the free embroidery settings on your sewing machine.",
        "Place the bottom patch underneath the hole, and run the lines of stitching very close together to completely catch all edges of the hole onto the bottom patch.",
        "Sew the bottom patch into place.",
        "Stitch back and forth, and up and down, creating a \"fabric\" of stitching across the hole or tear.",
        "Sew in straight stitch all around the edges of the bottom patch to keep the hole reinforced.",
        "Cover with the top patch.",
        "Place the folded-edge side down onto the fabric so it completely covers all the machine stitching.",
        "Hand-sew with matching thread (applique style) onto the top of the garment.",
        "Work the thread around it several times for strength.",
        "If you prefer a \"rustic\" look, you can also embroider with blanket stitch around this patch."
