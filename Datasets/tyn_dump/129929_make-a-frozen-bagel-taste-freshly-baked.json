        "Keep in mind that you can always toast a bagel more, but if it is overdone you can\u2019t make it less toasted.",
        "Every toaster is different, so use your best judgment when deciding what setting to use.",
        "It should be a bit higher than what you would use for toast since the bagel is thicker than sliced bread.Using a Toaster Oven: If you don\u2019t have a toaster or prefer to use a toaster oven, the steps are basically the same.",
        "Just insert the oven rack into the middle position and put your bagel on it with the sliced sides facing up.",
        "Choose how done you want your bagel to be, and start the toaster oven.",
        "Use your favorite bagel toppings to create a satisfying meal or snack.",
        "Once the bagel is done, remove it from the toaster and set it on a plate.",
        "It\u2019ll be really hot, so be careful to not burn your fingers.",

        "If the bagel was wrapped individually, take it out of its wrap and throw it away.",
        "If it was stored in bulk with other bagels, take it out and rewrap the rest of the bagels before replacing them in the freezer.",
        "Microwaving a bagel is a good way to quickly heat it up straight from the freezer.",
        "Keep in mind that it won\u2019t produce a crispy exterior, though.",
        "If you do want that crispy outside, opt for the toaster or bake the bagel in the oven.",
        "Sprinkle warm water onto the bagel.",
        "It may seem counterintuitive, but adding some water to the bagel will keep it from drying out too much in the microwave.",
        "If the bagel is pre-sliced, keep it whole during this step.",
        "Dip your fingers in warm water and flick it all over the exterior of the bagel.",
        "You could also wrap the bagel in a moistened paper towel for an even chewier bagel.",

        "Put the bagel on a microwave-safe dish.",
        "Separate the bagel halves and put them face-side up on a plate.",
        "If you choose to not use a plate or dish, set them on top of a paper towel in the microwave to keep them from sticking to the surface.",
        "If the bagel is unsliced, you could either slice it before you microwave it or wait until afterward.",
        "Microwave the bagel in 20-second increments until it is cooked through.",
        "The total cooking time depends on your microwave, but it usually takes about 1 minute and 15 seconds to 2 minutes to thoroughly cook through.",
        "Test how done it is by poking the doughy section with your finger\u2014if the bagel still feels cold or hard, it\u2019s not done yet.",
        "Be careful when taking the plate out of the microwave as it may be hot to the touch.",
        "Freezing Bagels Properly Slice bagels before freezing them so they\u2019re ready to eat at any time.",
        "Use a serrated bread knife or purchase a mechanical slicer to make separating bagels a quick and easy task.Tip: If you are slicing multiple flavors of bagels, wipe down the knife or slicer between each kind so the flavors don\u2019t transfer to one another.",
        "You don\u2019t want the remnants of an onion bagel infiltrating a blueberry bagel!",
        "Wrap bagels individually in plastic wrap or aluminum foil.",
        "Wrapping the bagels individually before freezing them prevents freezer burn, which is a surefire way to ruin the flavor of the bagels.",
        "Use enough material to fully cover the entire bagel.",

        "Wrapping them up will help them retain a bit more moisture than they would if you froze them all together.",
        "Place all the bagels into a freezer-safe resealable plastic bag.",
        "Once the bagels have been wrapped individually, you can store them all together in the same big plastic bag.",
        "Just make sure to use a bag that is resealable and preferably made for use in the freezer.",

        "Store bagels in the freezer for 6-12 months for the best quality of taste.",
        "Ideally, try to use the bagels within the first week of freezing them for the freshest taste.",
        "But if you need or want to store them for longer, go for it!",
        "This is a great way to store bagels that you buy or make in bulk.",
        "Label the bag with the \u201cfrozen on\u201d date so that you remember how long they\u2019ve been in storage.",
        "Discard any bagels that are discolored or develop freezer burn.",
        "Technically, the bagel will still be safe to eat as long as it has been frozen properly, but it probably won\u2019t taste very good anymore."
