This will make them easier to handle, and you can always trim the stems off at the end. Rinse the mint leaves in cool water and gently pat them dry with a paper towel. If you are planning on using these leaves to decorate a cake, choose ones that look nice. Don't use any bruised or torn leaves. Beat the egg white in a small bowl until it turns frothy. You can do this using a fork or a small whisk. If you are worried about Salmonella, use pasteurized egg whites or dried egg whites instead. If you are going to use powdered egg whites, mix them with about 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of water first. Brush the egg white mixture onto the mint leaves as thinly as possible. Make sure that both sides are evenly coated, or the sugar won't stick. If the mixture is too runny after you have brushed it on, wait 1 minute before proceeding. This will allow the egg white to solidify a little. Coat both sides of the mint leaves with sugar. You can do this simply by tossing them in a bowl of sugar, or holding them by the stems and sprinkling sugar over them.
