To achieve the same effect with a cotton sheet, spread a polyurethane wrap over the cotton, taping it tightly at the ends of the sheet. Secure the paper or sheet with cotton or polyester twill tape, which you can find at craft stores. Leave an additional 2 feet (0.61 m) of paper or sheet along the width of the rug. If you use polyurethane on sheet, wash the sheet well before using again. Avoid using plastic to roll your rug. Plastic prevents the rug from breathing and can attract moths or other small insects that can damage your carpet."

Subtract your own weight from it to get the weight of the rug by itself. For example, if you and the rug together weigh 150 pounds (68 kg), but you only weigh 135 pounds (61 kg), then the rug weighs 15 pounds (6.8 kg).

        "Let the solution sink into the rug for as long as indicated in the cleaner\u2019s instructions.",
        "Check the weather forecast before you clean your rug to make sure you won\u2019t be interrupted by rain.",
        "You ideally want 3-4 days without rain, to give your rug time to dry outside.",
        "Rinse your rug thoroughly with a garden hose and let it dry.",
        "Make sure you completely hose off all the suds.",
        "Run a squeegee over the wet rug to remove excess water and wring it out as much as you can.",
        "Let it sit outside and air dry until you can squeeze it hard without feeling any wetness.",
        "The drying process may take more than a day or two, so be patient.",
        "It will be worth it when you have a clean rug at the end!",
        "If the forecast changes and predicts rain before your rug is dry, simply move it to the driest, sunniest room in your house and let it sit until dry.",
        "Vacuum one more time to straighten the fibers.",
        "Now that your rug is clean and dry, give it on last vacuuming.",
        "This will neaten up the fibers, which are probably bent a bit strangely from the washing."
