Pan-Frying Melt \u20443 inch (0.85 cm) of shortening in a skillet. Place enough shortening into a skillet so it comes \u20443 inch (0.85 cm) up the side once it melts over low heat. Use a heavy frying pan or cast-iron skillet. Heat the shortening to 325 \u00b0F (163 \u00b0C). Insert a frying thermometer on the side of the skillet so the tip is in the melted shortening. Turn the burner up once the shortening has melted and continue to heat it until it reaches 325 \u00b0F (163 \u00b0C). The shortening shouldn't go over 325 \u00b0F (163 \u00b0C) or it will burn.
