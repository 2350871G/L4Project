Then, write your friend's address on the envelope. Make sure it is your best penmanship, or have someone with good handwriting write it. If you know calligraphy, now's the time to use it. Also add Hogwarts return address below the crest (or on the back of the envelope, which is more commonplace in Britain). If you want, you can make the paper look old before you fold the letter and put it in an envelope. See How to make paper look old or How to age paper using tea for more ideas."

One creative way is to make an origami owl. (You can find a clever design by searching \"origami owl bookmark\" and clicking on the result by Activity TV.) Put the letter in the owl's \"beak\", where you would normally put the page. Then you can put the owl in the witch/wizard's desk or backpack, etc. Another way is, when you go to your friend's house, offer to grab the mail and secretly put the letter in the pile. If you're a good actor, then feign shock when you see the letter, or do an oblivious \"What's this for?\" and hand your friend the letter. You can also just mail it to them using the postal service. It's less magical, but people love getting mail."
