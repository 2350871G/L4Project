Or, brush some craft glue on the tops of some metal push tacks and sprinkle any color glitter onto them. Allow these to dry, then use them to pin your photos directly into your walls. To create a gallery, use the same color glitter on as many tacks as you need to hang multiple photos in the same area. Tacks will put holes in both your walls and photos, so make sure you are okay with this before using them."

Creating a Photo Mobile Paint a 1\u20132 feet (0.30\u20130.61 m) wooden dowel solid black. Buy some acrylic paint and a wooden dowel at a craft store. If you don\u2019t want to make your mobile black, go for a different color. You\u2019ll just need yarn and cardstock to match whatever color you choose. Cut a 1.5 feet (0.46 m) piece of black yarn for your hanger. Tie the ends of the yarn to the ends of the dowel with double knots, then secure the knots to the dowel with super glue. Next cut 3-4 long pieces of yarn, with the length depending on how many photos you want to attach to each piece. Tie these to the dowel in double knots so that they\u2019re hanging down, and secure them with a dot of super glue. Cut large triangles out of heavy black card stock. Make as many triangles as you have pieces of hanging yarn. You can make them about the size of a photo, or alternate sizes. Punch 1 hole into either the tops or bottoms of each one (you can alternate tops/bottoms to have alternating direction triangles), and tie knots in the ends of your yarn to attach them.
