For example, if you want your circle to be 4 inches (10 cm) across, then your desired radius would be 2 inches (5.1 cm) since the radius is equal to half of the diameter. Therefore, you\u2019d cut the piece of string to be about 3\u20134 inches (7.6\u201310.2 cm) long so you have extra string on each end to tie the loops with."
