You want to prevent the worms from getting the chance to retract back into the dirt. If you grab a worm while it\u2019s trying to go back into the dirt, do not yank it out of the ground. This can most definitely break the worm in half. Instead, hold steady pressure, keeping their body taut (don\u2019t pull), and the worm will eventually relax and release their hold from the dirt. After grabbing a worm or two, dip your fingers into the apron full of sawdust. This will help dry your fingers from the slime covering the worms, and increase your grip when picking up the worms. Depending on what you\u2019re using the worms for, a dozen or two dozen worms should suffice. You don\u2019t want to remove a large number of worms from any given area, because it could have serious negative repercussions for that natural environment."
