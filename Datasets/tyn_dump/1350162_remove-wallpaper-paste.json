There are a variety of solutions you can use for the job:\nHot water and a few squirts of dish soap. This works perfectly well on most wallpaper paste. Fill up a gallon-sized bucket with the solution. Hot water and vinegar. This is great for tougher jobs. Mix a gallon of hot water and a gallon of white distilled vinegar. Try adding 1 to 2 tablespoons (14.8 to 29.6 ml) of baking soda into the bucket. The baking soda helps to dissolve the wallpaper paste. Trisodium phosphate, or TSP. TSP is an industrial-grade cleaner that was once widely used as a cleaner. Is it extremely strong, but not great for the environment, so try using when other, gentler methods have been exhausted. For the heaviest jobs, you might want to buy wallpaper paste remover from the store. The commercial removers use chemicals to quickly dissolve the paste. Follow the directions to mix commercial wallpaper paste remover. It is available from most paint or hardware stores, and contains ingredients created specifically to dissolve wallpaper paste."
