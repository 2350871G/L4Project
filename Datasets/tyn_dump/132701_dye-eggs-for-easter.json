Hard boil the eggs. Do this by placing the eggs into a saucepan with a pinch of salt and covering with water. Bring to the boil and then reduce to a simmer. Simmer for at least ten (10) minutes and then lift the eggs out carefully with a spoon or tongs. Place them under cold running water until they are cool enough to handle, at least a minute, and cool completely on a rack in the refrigerator before using. Buy an egg decorating kit! These usually consist of several dye pellets, colour coded cups, a special egg spoon, and, of course, directions to make the dye. Or buy a set of little bottles of food colouring, which you can use for all kinds of projects such as tie-dyed cake."

Make sure to have both nearby. You can use a glass, cup, or a bowl to pour the water into, just make sure the container has enough space for the egg. A disposable plastic cup (suitable for hot liquids, if you're using them) would be perfect because staining it won't matter and it may cushion eggs dropped in a little. Set the containers of dye in a row. Place the hard boiled eggs in one spot for easy access. It's also a good idea to set up the work surface by covering it with newspaper (you can then rest the eggs on this as you add more dye effects, and it will also catch dye drips.) And add an egg carton or a wire rack for drying the eggs on after they are dyed."

You could dye an egg a light colour, mask off parts, and dye the rest a darker colour. Naturally, you can add decorative effects after dyeing as well. It's really up to you and a good way to find out what you prefer is to try decorating both before and after dyeing the eggs."

Note that if you want to dye some eggs normally or give them a base colour before marbling, do that first. Once the oil is in the dye, you can't go back! Experiment by adding a bit more oil to the dyes; different amounts create different amounts of marbling. Better yet, float droplets of a concentrated food coloring-vinegar (for colorfastness) mixture on a bed of shaving cream or float droplets of an oil-based immiscible food coloring on water, rake the color into a loose pattern, and dip the egg briefly to marble it as one would marble paper. You may need to dip one end or side of the egg at a time. A pair of tongs with loop-ended jaws would hold the egg securely and mask very little of its surface. If you use shaving cream, let the egg dry before rubbing off the excess foam.
