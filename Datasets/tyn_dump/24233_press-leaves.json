Stores that sell lumber usually will cut this for you. Drill holes for bolts in each corner of both pieces of wood. It\u2019s best to measure the placement of your holes to ensure they will line up no matter which way you put it together. Place bolts through the four holes in one piece of wood, with washers between the bolt and the wood. Cut clean cardboard and paper to the size of the press. These should be clean, so replace them when needed. Recycle cardboard boxes to cut your own to size. If the press is not square, cut your cardboard so the channels run in the direction of the shorter side for better air circulation."
