You can scrunch, twirl, massage your hair for a more tousled look. Creating a Low Ponytail Start with blow dried hair. Begin with damp hair. Spray it with a heat protectant spray. Blow-dry it roughly so that it appears tousled and messy when it is dry. You can find a heat protectant spray at many supermarkets and all beauty supply stores. Divide hair into sections. First part your hair. Part is softly; a hard part works better for sleep ponytails. Then divide your hair into at least three medium-sized sections. The amount of sections you divide your hair into depends on how thick your hair is. Texturize the hair. Going one section at a time, twist each section by holding the hair at the end. Then spritz it with a texturizing spray. Blow-dry the section. Repeat for all sections. Run your fingers through your hair when you are finished texturizing. Put the hair into a low ponytail. Gather your hair into a low ponytail. Secure the ponytail with an elastic. Leave out the extra strands of hair or pull a few out for a messier look. Finish the ponytail with hairspray.
