                    "description": "Usually ginger comes in a big piece with branches attached at odd angles. Depending on the amount of ginger that you need, you may want to take a piece from the larger part of the root, or you may just want a couple of small branches. If you are using all of the root, trim the branches, so that you can peel them separately. If a few bits of ginger skin don\u2019t bother you, don\u2019t trim the branches. They will not get in the way of mincing the ginger."

Using a spoon allows you to remove the paper-thin skin of the ginger, without losing too much of the meat. Use a spoon with a very thin edge. Anchor the ginger on the cutting board on its flat side (if the bottom of the ginger is bumpy, just slice it off so that you have something flat to anchor with). Then use a brisk snapping motion to tear off the ginger skin with the side of the spoon."

Push the blade toward and past your thumb, with your thumb following the blade down the length of the ginger. Use your other hand to guide the direction of the cuts."
