You'll also need craft sticks, disposable plates, PVA glue, wood glue, 120-grit sandpaper, and paintbrushes or rollers. Gather old clothes, rags, a sheet or drop cloth, painter's tape, and a paint stirrer as well. Glue craft sticks together to cover the hole.

Applying the Wood Filler Mix your wood filler using a craft stick and a disposable paper plate. Follow the directions on the tin of the wood filler you're using. Directions vary depending on the manufacturer. There's no need to mix a large amount of wood filler. A small amount of wood filler on the plate will do the job.
