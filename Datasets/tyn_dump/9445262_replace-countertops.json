Undo these screws to free the countertop and move it from the wooden supports. Stubborn countertops, particularly older ones installed incorrectly, need to be pried off the countertops with a pry bar. Pry up 1 inch (2.5 cm) and then move 12 inches (30 cm) down the length of your countertop until you reach the end. Then you can use a larger pry bar to lift the entire countertop. You may also slip a reciprocal saw between the countertop and cabinets to cut screws and nails. To avoid damaging the countertops, be careful and work as slowly as possible. Avoid cutting into the countertop from above when using a saw. Many marble or granite countertops are only put on with adhesives rather than screwed in."
