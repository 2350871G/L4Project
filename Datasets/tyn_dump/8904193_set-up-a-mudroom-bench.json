But if your mudroom is narrow, this can create a bottleneck, making it difficult for others to bypass anyone already sitting on the bench. Position your bench against the wall opposite the door to avoid entryway congestion. Mudroom benches are generally positioned against walls to save space and prevent the bench from becoming a cumbersome obstacle. Many mudrooms have wall hangers for jackets. Tall benches may make it impossible to hang long jackets from these hangers if it is positioned beneath them. Measure and record the dimensions of your mudroom and its door with a tape measure. Keep these with you when purchasing with your bench so you know your mudroom\u2019s size limitations."
