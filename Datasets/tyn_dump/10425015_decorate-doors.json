        "Use the medium height flowers or branches to make up the middle.",
        "As you place them in the basket, have them line the front of the taller stems, without blocking them.",

        "If you have any extra florets or branches, integrate them into the arrangement to fill it out.",
        "Mount the basket on the door with a wreath hook.",
        "Wreath hooks are great if you don't want to damage your door.",
        "You can either buy an adjustable hook that sits flat against the door or an over-the-door hanger that is curved so it can clear any decorative panels on the door.",
        "To hang the basket, place the hook over the door and place the hook through one of the openings in the side or the basket.",
        "For metal doors, you can use a magnetic hook that you place where you want your basket to hang.",
        "They can usually support around 20 lb (9.1 kg)."
