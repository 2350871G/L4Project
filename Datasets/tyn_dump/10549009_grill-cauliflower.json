If your grill has large grates, lay a piece of aluminium foil over the grill to stop the florets from falling through the gaps. Grills typically take 10-15 minutes to heat up. Chop the cauliflower into large 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) florets. Use a sharp knife to cut up the cauliflower into pieces. Try to make the florets similar sizes so that they cook evenly on the grill.
