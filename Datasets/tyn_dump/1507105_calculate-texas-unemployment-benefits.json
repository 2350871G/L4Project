You will use your base-payments to discover your weekly benefit allowance (WBA) and maximum benefit amount (MBA). Take the following steps to learn what your benefits might be:\nFor your WBA, find your base period quarter with the highest wages. Divide those wages by 25 then round to the nearest dollar. This number cannot exceed the maximum allowed on your benefit statement. An example of finding your WBA would be $1,500/25, which is a WBA of $60. To find your MBA, multiply your weekly amount by 26 and find what 27% of all your wages in the base period would be. Whichever number is lower is your MBA. An example MBA might be 60*26=$1560 compared to 20% of $1,500 which is $300. $300 in this case would be the MBA. Multiply your WBA by 37. If this number is less than your base period wages, you won't qualify for a claim."
