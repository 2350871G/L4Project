To trim it, gently pull the hair up, away from your body and then cut it back with small, sharp scissors, preferably clippers, along with some equipped with safety guards. Alternatively, use an electric scissor-action trimmer without rotating heads. Aim for hair that is shorter than 1/4\" (0.6 cm). If you are new to pubic shaving, you may want to leave your hair short for a couple of days, as this will allow you to get used to the feeling of being bare down there. Trimming your hairs with scissors or small clippers is ok to do too, but some people become nervous when having such items near such a tender part of your body. If you aren't comfortable with using any of these, try electric razors. They are specifically designed to shave these kinds of hairs without getting too close to cut your skin."
