Other examples of variable costs include raw materials, commissions paid to sales people, freight in and freight out. Determine the price at which you will sell your product. Pricing strategies are part of a much more comprehensive marketing strategy, and can be fairly complex.

Remember price by itself does not drive sales. People will pay for good value. Your goal is to increase your market share so you can then be the price driver. Calculating Contribution Margin and Break-Even Point Calculate your unit contribution margin. The unit contribution margin represents how much money each unit sold brings in after recovering its own variable costs. It is calculated by subtracting a unit's variable costs from its sales price. Consider the following example using an oil change business. The sales price of an oil change is $40 (note that these calculations will work equally well when expressed in other currencies). Each oil change has 3 costs associated with it: purchasing a $5 oil filter, purchasing a $5 can of oil, and paying $10 in wages to the technician performing the oil change. These are the variable costs associated with an oil change. The contribution margin for a single oil change is: $40 - (5 + 5 + 10) or $20. Providing an oil change to a customer brings the company $20 in revenue after recovering its own variable costs. Calculate the contribution margin ratio. This will give you a percentage that can be used to determine the profits that will result from various sales levels. To calculate the contribution margin ratio, divide the contribution margin by sales. Using the example above, divide the contribution margin of $20 by $40 sales price. The result is a contribution margin ratio of 50%. Calculate your company's break-even point. The break-even point tells you the volume of sales you will have to achieve to cover all of your costs. It is calculated by dividing all your fixed costs by your product's contribution margin. Using the example above, imagine all of your company's fixed costs for a given month are $2000. Therefore, the break-even point is: 2000 / 20 = 100 units. When 100 oil changes have been performed in a month, the company \"breaks even.\" Calculating Profits and Losses Determine your expected profits or losses. Once you have calculated the break-even volume, you can estimate your expected profits. Remember that each additional unit sold will produce revenue equal to its contribution margin. Therefore, each unit sold above the break-even point will produce a profit equal to its contribution margin, and each unit sold below the break-even point will generate a loss equal to its contribution margin. Calculate projected profits. Using the example above, imagine your business provides 150 oil changes in a month. Only 100 oil changes were needed to break even, so the additional 50 oil changes will generate a profit of $20 each, for a total of (50 * 20) or $1000. Calculate projected losses. Now imagine your business provided only 90 oil changes in a month. You didn't achieve your break-even volume, so you sustained a loss. Each of the 10 oil changes under your break-even volume generated a loss of $20, for a total of (10 * 20) or $200.",
