Your contacts were formulated to last for a certain period of time. After that point, they start to deteriorate, making them less comfortable and more likely to collect germs, bacteria, or debris that can harm your eyes. Sleep in your contacts only if your doctor approves it. Taking off your contacts every night may seem like an inconvenience, but it\u2019s very important. Sleeping in contacts that aren\u2019t labeled for extended wear can dry out your eyes, expose your eyes to more bacteria, and lead to serious complications, like ulcers. Always remove your contacts at night unless your doctor tells you it\u2019s safe to sleep in them. If you have dry eyes, you may not be able to sleep in contacts even if they\u2019re approved for sleeping. Talk to your doctor if you think you have dry eyes. Clean or replace your contact lens case every 3 months. It\u2019s normal for a contact lens case to get dirty over time. To clean your case, bring a pot of water to boiling. Next, put the contact lens case into the boiling water and wait at least 3 minutes. Remove the water from the heat, then use tongs or a slotted spoon to remove the contact lens case from the water. Let the case cool before handling it. Finally, rinse it with saline solution before using it again. As an alternative, replace your case with a new one, which may be the safest option.Warning: If your case looks damaged or cracked, replace it immediately, regardless of how long you\u2019ve had it. Using a damaged or cracked case increases your risk of developing an infection. Avoid using saliva or tap water to clean your lenses. Don\u2019t ever put your contacts in your mouth to clean them, as this will make them very dirty. Your saliva isn\u2019t sterile, and it will introduce germs and bacteria to your lenses. Similarly, tap water is also not sterile, and any bacteria or chemicals in the water will stick to your contacts. Additionally, both saliva and water will dry out your lenses. Always clean your lenses with a contact solution. It\u2019s helpful to carry a bottle of contact solution with you when you\u2019re out. You can even find a trial sized version to make it easier to fit in your bag. Make sure eye drops are labeled for use with contacts. Most eye drops will dry out your contacts, even if they're labeled for treating dry eyes. If you want to moisten your eyes while you're wearing contacts, read the label to find out if the drops are safe for contacts. Eye drops that are safe to use with your contacts are typically kept near the contact lens solution at your local drug store. Otherwise, you can buy them online. Remove your contacts before you take a bath or shower. Your contacts can easily get damaged in the shower because tap water and suds from your personal care products can get onto your lenses. This can dry out your contacts and leave behind residue and potentially harmful bacteria. Always remove your contacts before your bath or shower so that you contacts don't get ruined. If you wear your contacts in the bath or shower, you may develop an eye infection. Avoid swimming or using a hot tub while wearing your contacts. Pools, waterways, and hot tubs contain bacteria, germs, and sometimes chemicals. Splashing water or water on your skin can get into your eyes and on your contacts, which may damage or contaminate your contacts. This can cause eye irritation or an eye infection. Instead, take off your contacts before you get into the water and wear your glasses. It's not safe to wear contacts you wore while swimming, even after you clean them. Keep a pair of back-up glasses in your current prescription. Although you might wear your contacts most of the time, you need to have a pair of backup glasses for times you aren\u2019t wearing them. Wear your glasses at night to give your eyes a break from your contacts. Additionally, wear your glasses if you\u2019re experiencing any eye irritation or think you may have an infection. Visit your eye doctor if you think you may have an infection. If you\u2019re worried about the cost of your backup glasses, look for a budget option. For instance, you can buy glasses online for as low as $6.95. Just ask your doctor to give you a copy of your prescription and to write your pupillary distance (PD) on it, which is a measurement you\u2019ll need to buy your glasses.",
