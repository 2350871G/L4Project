    "text": " Baking a Mug Cake in the Microwave Pick your mug. You can use any type of mug for the cake. A larger deeper mug will create a softer moister cake, while a smaller shallower mug will create a firmer cake. Create the cake mix. Add two tablespoons of brown sugar or honey to the mug. Add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and then 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) of flour. It is okay to use regular flour if you don't have self-rising, but the cake will end up more like a brownie in texture. Crack an egg into the mug. The great thing about mug cakes is that there is virtually no cleanup; just toss the shell in the compost or trash. Add butter. Soften a stick of butter on the countertop and scoop a tablespoon into the mug. You can use salted or unsalted butter, or margarine. Add a tablespoon or two of chocolate chips (optional). Adding the chocolate chips will create a chocolate flavored mug cake. If you prefer a vanilla cake, you can add an additional tablespoon of vanilla extract instead. Mix it all together. Use a spoon to stir up the contents of the mug. Stir until the chocolate chips are folded in, or all the contents are combined. Don\u2019t worry about the top edges of the mug getting messy, your cake will rise up in the microwave anyway. Bake the mug cake. Put the mug in the microwave for 50 seconds on full power.

Take a spoon and dig in. If you'd like, frost and decorate the cake first. Be careful when removing the mug from the microwave. Use a hot pot holder or a towel to lift it out. It will probably be too hot to grab. Baking a Whole Cake in the Microwave Mix the cake batter. In a large bowl, combine 3/4 cup softened butter or margarine with 3/4 cup sugar and 2/3 cup flour. Stir together with a spoon or rubber spatula. It's okay to use regular flour if you don't have self-rising, but the cake will end up more like a brownie in texture.

Frosting and Decorating the Cake Pick whatever frosting you desire. You can use store bought, or make your own frosting. Try chocolate, vanilla, lemon, or any flavor that you like the most. Experiment with different flavors to find your favorite. Cool the cake fully before trying to put on icing, or the icing will melt. Make sufficient frosting. It would be better to end up with leftover frosting than to run out before you are done decorating. Frost the cake. Have the frosting at room temperature. Use a long rubber spatula or spoon to spread frosting over the surface of your cake. Decorate with fresh fruit. Slice fresh strawberries thinly and place them on top of the frosting in a pattern or randomly. Brush with seedless jam. You can substitute the strawberries for fresh mango, banana, or any softer fruit you desire. If you're using fresh fruit, add it at the last minute. If the fruit is wet, it could cause the frosting to move or melt slightly. Add some sprinkles. Sprinkles are a fun way to make a colorful confetti cake. You can also add a pinch of sprinkles to your cake batter before baking. Pack on the sweets. Sprinkle a handful of mini marshmallows on top of the cake for a super sweet addition. Dust the marshmallows with a pinch of powdered sugar. Add extra chocolate.
