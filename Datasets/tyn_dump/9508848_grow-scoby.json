Wait until the tea is at about room temperature (68 \u00b0F (20 \u00b0C)) before you do anything with it. Creating an Environment for Growth Pour the black tea into a sterile glass jar. Get a large wide-mouthed glass jar and be sure to clean it thoroughly so that no germs or bacteria grow in it. Then, pour in your room temperature tea. To easily and effectively clean your jar, wash it with hot water and vinegar. Add a bottle of store-bought kombucha tea. Get a bottle of raw organic kombucha tea and pour the entire contents of the bottle into your freshly brewed black tea. You can purchase a bottle of kombucha tea at a grocery store or online. Cover the jar with a paper towel and secure it with a rubber band. Lay a paper towel or cheesecloth over the  opening of your glass jar so that it\u2019s completely covered.

Pour the water into a pot and set it on a burner. Turn the burner on to medium-high heat to bring the water to a boil.

This is necessary because the scoby feeds on sugar and because your starter tea likely has an undesirable bitter taste at this point. Keep it at room temperature for 1-3 days to let it carbonate. Keep your freshly brewed kombucha tea out of direct sunlight and in a room temperature environment for a few days. This will make your tea sightly carbonated, as kombucha tea typically is. Store it in the refrigerator and drink it within a month. After a couple of days kept at room temperature, you\u2019ll want to move it to the refrigerator, as refrigeration will stop fermentation and carbonation. Make sure to drink your kombucha tea within a month.",
