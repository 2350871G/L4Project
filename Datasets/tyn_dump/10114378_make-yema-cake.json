    "text": " Baking the Chiffon Cake Preheat the oven to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) and line 2 round baking pans. Get out 2 round cake pans that are 8 in (20 cm) in diameter. Tear off a sheet of parchment paper for each pan and cut it to fit into the bottom and sides of the pan. The parchment will make it easier to remove the cakes from the pan. Heat the butter, cream cheese, and milk over low heat. Measure 3.5 tablespoons (50 g) of butter into a small saucepan along with 8.8 ounces (250 g) of cream cheese and \u20442 cup (120 ml) of milk. Stir and heat the mixture until it's smooth and melted. Once the mixture is smooth, turn off the burner and let it cool while you prepare the dry ingredients. Whisk the flour, baking powder, cornstarch, and salt. Put \u00bd cup (64 g) of flour, 3 tablespoons (24 g) of cornstarch, 1 teaspoon (4 g) of baking powder, and \u00bc teaspoon (1 g) of salt into a bowl. Whisk the dry ingredients until they're combined. If you prefer, you can sift the dry ingredients into the bowl. Put the creamy mixture into a large bowl and mix in the dry ingredients. Transfer the cooled cream cheese mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer. Turn the mixer to low speed and gradually add the dry ingredients. If you don't have a stand mixer, use a large bowl and a handheld mixer or spoon to mix the batter. Mix in 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of lemon juice and 6 egg yolks. Separate 6 eggs and set the egg whites aside in a large mixing bowl. Add the lemon juice and yolks to the cake batter. Beat the batter on low speed until the yolks are incorporated. Set the batter aside. It's important to use a very clean mixing bowl to hold the egg whites. Don't let any of the yolk end up in the whites or they won't whip properly. Beat the egg whites and cream of tartar on high for 1 minute. Use clean whisk attachments to beat the 6 egg whites and \u00bc teaspoon (0.8 g) cream of tartar. Turn the mixer to high and beat the whites until they're white and fluffy. Beat in the sugar and vanilla on high speed.

Keep folding until the egg whites are incorporated and the batter is only a little lumpy. Avoid stirring or beating the whites into the batter or they'll lose the volume that you beat into them. Spread the batter into the 2 prepared cake pans. Divide the batter and put half of the batter in each cake pan. Use the back of a spoon or an offset spatula to gently level the tops. Bake the cakes for 1 hour. Put the cake pans in the oven and cook the chiffon cakes until they spring back when you touch the centers. You can also test the cakes by inserting a toothpick. If the toothpick comes out clean, the cakes are finished. If the cakes aren't done, return them to the oven and check them again after 5 more minutes. Cool the cakes. Turn off the oven and remove the cakes from the oven. Turn the cakes onto a wire rack and let them cool completely. Avoid leaving the cakes in the pans to cool or they may stick. Mixing the Filling and Frosting Put the sweetened condensed milk, yolks, and vanilla in a saucepan. Open 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk and scoop them into a large saucepan. Crack 6 eggs and separate the yolks from the whites. Put the yolks into the saucepan along with 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of vanilla extract. Discard or save the whites to use in another recipe. Stir and cook the mixture for 4 to 5 minutes. Turn the burner to medium-low and stir the filling mixture to combine it. Stir the filling frequently as it cooks to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the saucepan. The filling will become very thick once it's finished cooking. Stir in the butter until it's melted. Cut 4 tablespoons (56 g) of butter into 4 pieces and add them to the hot filling. Stir to incorporate the butter as it melts. The filling should now be a thick custard. Assembling and Decorating the Cake Spread some of the hot filling over 1 of the cakes. Place 1 of the cake layers on your serving plate and spoon 1/3 of the filling mixture on top. Use the back of a spoon or an offset spatula to spread the filling across the top of the cake. Spread the filling while it's still hot, but the cakes are cool. Stack the other cake layer on top and cover the cake with frosting. Place the other cake layer on top of the bottom layer. Spread the rest of the filling mixture over the top and sides of the cake. To make it easier to frost, put the cake on a turnable cake stand. This will allow you to spin the cake as you frost the sides. Cool the cake and decorate it with cheddar and cookies. Let the cake cool for about 30 minutes. Once the frosting is at room temperature, sprinkle the top and sides of the cake with \u00bd cup (50 g) of grated mild cheddar. If you like, insert cookies into the top of the cake for a garnish. Cover and refrigerate the leftover cake. Store the cake for up to 3 or 4 days.",
