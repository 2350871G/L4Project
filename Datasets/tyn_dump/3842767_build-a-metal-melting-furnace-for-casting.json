If the garbage is taller than 18 inches (46 cm), put a metal-cutting blade on an angle grinder and turn it on. Carefully cut around the outside of the garbage can to trim it down to size. Wear safety glasses while working with an angle grinder so you don\u2019t get any metal scraps in your eyes. Be careful of the cut edges on the garbage can since they may be sharp and could cut you easily. If you don\u2019t have an angle grinder or you just want a smaller forge, you can also use a 10 US qt (9.5 L) steel bucket that\u2019s 11 in (28 cm) tall."

A crucible is a metal container that you put inside of your furnace that holds the metal you\u2019re melting. Put the metal you want to melt inside the crucible and use a pair of fire tongs to set it in the middle of your furnace. Allow the furnace to heat the crucible and melt the metal before taking it out with tongs for casting. This furnace will melt low-temperature metals, such as aluminum and brass.",

        "Cut out the wool covering the hole in the side of the garbage can.",
        "Find the hole you made in the side of the garbage can and poke through it with a craft knife.",
        "Guide the knife around the edge of the hole so you cut through the wool lining the side of the garbage can.",
        "Once you cut around the edge, pull the piece of wool out from the hole.",
        "Spray a rigidizer on the wool and let it set for 24 hours.",
        "Rigidizer is a chemical compound that activates the particles in the ceramic fiber wool so it solidifies and holds its shape.",
        "Pour the rigidizer compound into a spray bottle, and apply it to all exposed sides of wool.",
        "Allow the rigidizer to air-dry for at least 24 hours so it can set and harden the wool.",
        "You can buy rigidizer online.",
        "Label the spray bottle you use for your rigidizer so you don\u2019t mix it up with other bottles you have.",
        "Some ceramic fiber wool is pre-treated with rigidizer and will start to harden when it\u2019s exposed to air.",
        "Check the packaging on the wool to see if there are any special instructions.",
        "Paint the surface of the wool with furnace cement and let it set completely.",

        "Fill in the bottom of the lid with 2 in (5.1 cm) of ceramic fiber wool.",
        "Cut out a circular piece of ceramic fiber wool that has a diameter that\u2019s 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) larger than the bottom of the lid.",
        "Push the wool into the bottom of the lid so it presses against the sides and holds firmly in place.",
        "Continue adding layers of ceramic wool until it\u2019s 2 inches (5.1 cm) thick to provide the best heat resistance.",
        "Wear long-sleeved clothing and a dust mask that\u2019s rated N95 or better while cutting and working with the wool since it can cause irritation and itchiness.",
        "Always check the MSDS label on the ceramic wool you\u2019re working with and follow any safety precautions listed on it.",
        "If the wool doesn\u2019t stick to the bottom of the lid, you can spray a heat-resistant adhesive on the lid before pushing the wool onto it.",
        "You can buy heat-resistant adhesive from hardware stores or online.",
        "Cut a hole in the wool that lines up with the lid\u2019s hole.",
        "Flip the lid so the handle faces up and locate the hole you drilled early.",
        "Poke a craft knife along the edge of the hole so it goes completely through the wool.",
        "Saw back and forth along the edge of the hole to remove the section of wool covering it.",
        "Don\u2019t leave the wool over the hole or else your furnace won\u2019t vent properly.Tip: If you have trouble cutting through the wool with a craft knife, then try using a serrated bread knife since it may cut through the wool easier.",
        "Apply a rigidizer to the wool and leave it to cure for 24 hours.",
        "Put your rigidizer compound in a spray bottle, and apply it directly to the ceramic fiber wool on the lid.",
        "Make sure to coat all of the exposed surfaces with the rigidizer or else it won\u2019t effectively harden.",
        "Once you\u2019ve put the rigidizer on all of the wool, let it set in a well-ventilated room for at least 24 hours so it can set.",
        "You can apply rigidizer with a paintbrush if you don\u2019t have a spray bottle handy.",
        "Brush furnace cement on all of the exposed wool to insulate it more.",
        "Mix your furnace cement with a stir stick to make sure it\u2019s thoroughly combined.",
        "Use a 2 in (5.1 cm) paintbrush to coat the exposed surfaces of the wool.",
        "Smooth out the cement with the brush before letting it set for at least 24 hours.",
        "Put cardboard or shop cloths down before you apply the cement so you don\u2019t accidentally get it on anything.",
        "Providing a Fuel Source Feed a steel pipe or burner through the side hole of the furnace.",
        "The kind of pipe you use depends on what you want to use for your fuel source.",

        "If you don\u2019t have an air blower, you can use an old hair dryer on the highest fan setting to move the air.",
        "Connect a propane tank to the other end of the burner if you\u2019re using gas.",
        "Attach an air supply hose between the valve on your propane tank and the control port on the end of the burner.",
        "Make sure the valves are completely closed while you aren\u2019t running the furnace so you don\u2019t waste your fuel or create a fire hazard.",
        "You can attach any propane tank to your furnace, but small tanks will run out faster while you\u2019re running your furnace.",
        "Light your furnace so it can heat up.",
        "If you\u2019re using charcoal, fill the bottom of the furnace with 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) of briquettes and use a lighter to light them.",
        "Turn on the air blower on its lowest setting to help the furnace heat up further.",
        "If you\u2019re using propane, open the valves on the tank and the burner.",
        "Reach a striker into the middle of your furnace and squeeze it to ignite the propane.",
        "Put the lid on top of the furnace so the heat doesn\u2019t escape.",
        "Use the valves on the propane tank and burner to control the size of the flame it produces.",
        "The flames from your furnace may come out from the vent hole you made in the lid, so use caution while you\u2019re handling it.",
        "Charcoal furnaces can usually reach a temperature of about 1,200 \u00b0F (649 \u00b0C) while propane can reach 2,300 \u00b0F (1,260 \u00b0C).",
        "Use a crucible when you want to melt metal.",
        "A crucible is a metal container that you put inside of your furnace that holds the metal you\u2019re melting.",
        "Put the metal you want to melt inside the crucible and use a pair of fire tongs to set it in the middle of your furnace.",
