    "text": " Mark off the existing countertop's dimensions with strips of wood so the ends overlap and fix the ends in place with hot melt glue to form a template.  Place the template onto a sheet of melamine, which is plywood with a stick resistant plastic coating, and cut out the outer dimensions of the shape formed by the template. To form the sides of the template, rip a sheet of melamine into 2 by 4 strips and nail them in place, then seal the joints with silicone caulk, allowing it to dry overnight. Carry the dry form to where your countertop will be and set it in place, removing any doors, drawers and hardware from the cabinet on which it will sit.  Mix the concrete according to the manufacturer's specifications, using a mason's hoe to blend the dry ingredients first, then carefully measuring and slowly pouring in the water, mixing as you pour.  Pour the concrete mixture into the template form until it is about two-thirds full.  Hold a running orbital sander on edge up against the bottom of the template form to shake and level the concrete mixture and eliminate air bubbles.  Cut and place steel reinforcing mesh on top of the concrete mixture and repeat the process with the orbital sander to sink the mesh into the mixture.  Pour a second layer of concrete mixture into the form until it reaches the rim.  Scrape off any excess and smooth the concrete by running the flat edge of a board across the surface while holding the ends of the board firmly to the form's edges.  Repeat this process several times until the concrete mixture is smooth and packed firmly into the form.  Leave the concrete to dry and cure for one week. Once the concrete has dried and cured, remove the sides of the form by tapping and prying it loose at the joints with a crowbar. Sand down any sharp edges with an orbital sander.  Etch the surface of the concrete by applying a wash of muriatic acid and water and then thoroughly rinsing the surface with water to remove the acid residue, and allowing the surface to air dry.  Mix up a batch of cement, latex additive and any color liquid pigment you desire until it is the consistency of peanut butter.  Apply it to the surface with a rubber-faced piece of flat wood.  Allow the surface to dry for an hour, then sand it with 180-grit paper and an orbital sander to the smoothness you desire.  Apply a small bead of silicone caulk to the top of the cabinet on which the counter sits and replace the doors or drawers and hardware you removed  earlier in the process.
