This will remove hair buildup, as well as dislodge skin and dandruff flakes. Continue brushing until the nylon brush rakes cleanly through the brush bristles. Wash the nylon brush to remove debris and allow it to dry completely before reusing it for this purpose. Use a teasing comb for layers of hair that are tightly wound. Teasing combs are dual sided with bristles and a hair sectioning point called a rat tail. Beginning at the base of your bristled brush, slide the rat tail under the collected hair and gently pull away from the brush. Repeat this on all sides of the cylinder or across the entire face of the pad. Once you have loosened and lifted the hair from the shaft, simply use your fingers to roll the hair up and off. Use scissors to help remove stubborn hair knots and clumps. Oftentimes, the hair will clump or knot in the process of removal. Make sure to have a pair of scissors handy for these occasions. Simple cut through the clump or knot to divide it into two or three sections. Be careful not to cut too much or the smaller pieces of hair may remain stuck. Cleaning Grime and Oil Use tea tree oil as an all-natural cleansing agent. Tea tree oil is an all-natural and highly-effective cleansing agent available at your local drug store or health foods market. Pour one cup of warm water into a medium sized bowl. Add a few drops of tea tree oil and stir to combine. Use a shampoo and baking soda cleansing agent if you have sensitive skin. For those with sensitive skin or allergies, using your own shampoo, plus baking soda, is a safe and gentle option. Pour one cup of warm water into a medium sized bowl. Add a teaspoon of shampoo and a teaspoon of baking soda and stir to combine. Dip a clean toothbrush in the cleansing agent. Using a clean toothbrush, dip the brush end in the solution.

Drying Your Hairbrush Use a clean dry cloth to dry your hairbrush if you have a wooden handle or paddle. It's important to immediately remove any excess water that has collected in the bristles or on the pad of a wooden brush. Moisture can cling and seep into brush bristles, cloth brush pads, and wood causing mold and rot. Using a cloth, gently press between the bristles to reach the surface of the cylinder or pad. Make sure to use adequate pressure to soak up any excess moisture. Lay your hairbrush, bristles facing down, on a cloth to air dry. Once you have absorbed excess moisture, it's important to allow the brush to fully dry before use. Place the bristles facing down on a clean and dry towel and allow to dry overnight. Use a hair dryer to quickly dry your hairbrush. If you need to use your brush right away, use a hair dryer set to its lowest setting to speed the drying process. Go back and forth over the brush a few times to blow out any remaining water drops and to ensure that the hairbrush is now damp rather than soaking wet.",
