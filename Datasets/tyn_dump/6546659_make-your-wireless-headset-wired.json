Cut the USB cable about 6\" - 10\" from the end that plugs into your PC or console. This is where we'll connect the step-up step-down module. Use the utility knife to slice the insulation of the USB cable, about an inch down from where you cut it, on both sides. Pull out the tiny wires inside. Cut away the other wires and excess insulation. We only need the red and black wires in the cable. Use your wire cutters to strip about half of the each exposed wire. Be careful not to use too much pressure. The wires are very small; too much pressure and you'll cut the wire instead of stripping it. Twist the bare stranded copper and insert them into the module. The end that goes into the PC/console gets screwed to the \"IN\" terminals and the other end for the headset gets screwed to the \"OUT\" terminals. Red wire for the positive and black wire for the negative. Adjust the voltage output of the module. To do this, plug in the USB cable into your PC or console.

Set the cable aside for now. Taking Apart the Headset Remove the ear pad from the side that the batteries insert into.  Use a small screwdriver (or T6 Torx if you're working on the X42) to remove the screws and reveal the wires insides. Be careful of the part with the speaker in it. It is only connected by two small wires that could pull out of their soldered joint. Take off the cover for the batteries and insert the end of the USB cable in through the opening by the spring. (Alternatively, you can drill a hole through the side to insert the cable through. Use a bit slightly larger than you USB cable. Use silicone, or more preferably, a hot glue gun to keep the wire in place.) Using the soldering iron, solder the red wire to the positive terminal. There should be a speaker wire connected here. Solder the black wire to the negative terminal (the one with spring on the other side). Make sure you solder it to the one with speaker wire as well. Keep in mind you aren't soldering these wires to either of the terminals that has the red wire connecting the positive and negative terminals. Close it all back up and put the ear pad back on.
