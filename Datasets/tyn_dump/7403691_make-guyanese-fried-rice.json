Take one and a half cups of white rice and wash it thoroughly. Place into the pot of boiling water. Leave it on the stove until rice is tender. This will take about 20 minutes. Do not over overcook the rice - you don\u2019t want it to be too soft. When the rice is finished cooking, strain any excess liquid (if there is any) in a colander or strainer. Make sure all the water is drained out. You don\u2019t want soggy fried rice. Let the rice cool off before placing it in a bowl. Leave cooked rice in the fridge overnight. This method will help the rice to be firm when frying it the following day. Following Day Get your ingredients ready the following day. Dice your carrots, sweet peppers, onions, and scallions. Mix the vegetables together in one large bowl. Empty the can of corn into another bowl and set aside for later. Get ready to start your cooking. Get a big bowl to section off your rice while it is still cold. Instead of frying all of the rice at once, put half into the bowl. You can place the other half back into the fridge for another day or you can make two batches of fried rice. Add one pack of fried rice seasoning, e.g. ginger powder or fresh real ginger and garlic powder into the bowl of rice. Stir it around making sure that all of the seasonings are well blended. Using a fork or spoon - you can taste some of the rice grains to make sure it is well seasoned to your liking. Turn on the stove on medium heat. Take 1 cup of sesame oil and place into a big frying pan. Pour in the carrots, sweet bell peppers and onions into the pan of hot oil to fry up.
