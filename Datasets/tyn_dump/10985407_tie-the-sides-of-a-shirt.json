If you don\u2019t have a shirt that you want to cut up, go thrift shopping to find plenty of cheap, unique options. Avoid using woolen shirts for this technique, as the wool tends to come undone once you cut it. Experiment with different fabrics. Cotton, linen, polyester, velvet, and silk all work well."
