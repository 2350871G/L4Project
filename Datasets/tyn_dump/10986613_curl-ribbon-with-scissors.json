        "Use 1 color or many colors to create an attractive bundle of curls.",
        "After you\u2019ve curled them all, line them up parallel to each other.",
        "Find the center point and create a single knot there.",
        "Or, you can knot them together at one end for a curled ribbon tassel.",
        "When creating a knot, you might be worried about ruining the curls.",
        "Luckily, curling ribbon is pretty resilient.",
        "Once it\u2019s been curled you\u2019ll have a hard time flattening it out!",
        "Tie the bundle to an anchor point using a short length of ribbon.",
        "If you\u2019re attaching the ribbon bundle onto something that has an anchor point of some sort, such as a gift box that already has some ribbon around it, or a gift tag with a hole at the top, knotting is the best way to secure it.",
        "Cut a small length of the same curling ribbon and wrap it around both the anchor point and the ribbon.",
        "Tie a double knot and trim the ends short.",
        "You won\u2019t even notice it!",
        "Curled ribbons also look pretty dangling from balloons and party chairs.",

        "Attach the ribbon bundle onto something else by taping or stapling it.",
        "If you\u2019re attaching the ribbons onto a paper craft project or another surface, place a short, narrow length of adhesive tape over the knotted part of the bundle and secure it onto the object\u2019s surface.",
        "Or, you can punch a staple through the ribbon bundle\u2019s central knot and the paper.",
        "Make sure both of the ends of the staple have gone completely through the ribbon so it doesn\u2019t come loose.",
        "Arrange the curls in an attractive design.",
        "If you\u2019ve used lots of strands of ribbon, you can fluff them around to achieve a loose, bouncy explosion of curls or a tight, orderly arrangement.",
        "Tuck different strands of ribbon over and under other ones.",
        "Blend together different colors and make sure the glossy side faces out.",
        "Hide the loose ends in the bundle, or pull them out and trim them on a 45-degree angle.",
        "Most importantly, have fun arranging your ribbon curls!",
        "Wind individual strands around your index finger and gently elongate them to re-orient curls that may have gotten twisted up."
