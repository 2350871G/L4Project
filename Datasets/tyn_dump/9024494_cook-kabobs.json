                    "description": "You can use any type of protein that you like for your kabobs, but beef, chicken, pork, lamb, and seafood are the most common options. Use a sharp knife to cut 3 \u00bd pounds (1.6 kg) of the protein you\u2019re using into approximately 2-inch cubes (5-cm) that you can easily thread on a skewer. When it comes to seafood, choose heartier fish, such as salmon, swordfish, or tuna. Shrimp also work well for kabobs. If you\u2019re a vegetarian, you can omit the protein or substitute tofu for any type of meat."

                    "description": "To ensure the most flavorful kabobs, you should create a marinade for the protein. Choose a marinade that complements the type of protein that you\u2019re using, and allow the meat sit in it for to 2 to 5 hours. A marinade doesn\u2019t really penetrate the meat or protein, so there\u2019s no need to marinate overnight. If you don\u2019t want to marinate the protein, you can simply season the protein on all sides with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Make a basic marinade by mixing 1 cup (237 ml) of vegetable oil, \u00be cup (177 ml) of soy sauce, \u00bd cup (118 ml) of lemon juice, \u00bc cup (59 ml) of Worcestershire sauce, \u00bc cup (62 g) of mustard, 2 garlic cloves, and freshly ground black pepper. You can also try a pineapple marinade, Jack Daniel\u2019s marinade, Coke marinade, or your personal favorite marinade recipe."

Onions, bell peppers, zucchini, grape tomatoes, and yellow squash are good options with most proteins. Use 3 to 4 whole vegetables, depending on their size, and cut them into chunks that are the same size as your protein.

Wooden skewers are inexpensive so you can throw them away when you\u2019re done and not worry about cleanup. They are prone to charring, though.

Alternating them is usually the most common method.
