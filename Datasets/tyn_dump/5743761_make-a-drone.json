                    "description": "Begin constructing your frame using the material of your choice. Model plastic, balsa wood, or thin metal (thinner than .25 inches (0.64 cm)) are best. For a simple quadcopter design, lay one 12 in (30 cm) long piece of wood, plastic or light metal across another, so it creates an \u201cX\u201d shape with 90-degree angles. Each extending arm of the drone frame should reach toward what would be the corner of a perfect square you could draw around the frame. Choose a frame material that is at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide to support mounting your engines. You can purchase model plastic, thin metal, or balsa wood at most hobby or model stores. You can also find these materials at drone retailers or on websites like Amazon. Use glue or duct tape to secure the two pieces of your frame together. Don't move on to the next step until the pieces of the frame are secure and any glue you've used has dried."

If there is no drone retailer nearby, many hobby stores that carry model rockets and R/C airplanes will carry them.

        "This ensures all four motors spin at the same speed so the drone will be level as it flies.",
        "Secure the battery to the frame.",
        "Consider the size and shape of your battery when looking for the right place to mount it.",
        "If it's flat, you can mount it in the center of the drone and then mount other components on top of it.",
        "If not, you may want to mount the battery on the underside of the drone along with the speed controllers.",
        "In most applications, mounting the battery in the center of the top of the frame is the best place.",
        "Use zip ties to hold the battery in place so you can remove it and move it if you need to adjust the weight distribution of the drone later.",
        "Install the power distribution board.",
        "Center the power distribution board on the drone frame, on top of the battery if you placed it there as well.",
        "Connect the lines from the speed controllers and the battery to the board once you've zip tied it down.",
        "The power distribution board relays the right amount of power to each component to keep the drone operating smoothly.",
        "Attach the flight controller to the drone frame with zip ties and connect it.",
        "The flight controller relays information from the remote control to the power distribution board.",
        "Position it on top of the power distribution board and then zip tie it down.",
        "Refer to the instructions for the flight controller and power distribution box to connect them properly, but in most applications, the connection will be one clearly marked wire that plugs directly from one into the other.",
        "Connecting the Controls Buy a wireless remote control system that works with your flight controller.",
        "Ask for help at your local hobby store or drone retailer to make sure to choose a remote control system that works with your specific flight controller.",
        "Often, you can buy them in bundles, but if not, the remote control system will list the flight controller systems it is compatible with on the box.",
        "Choose one that lists your flight controller.",
        "The remote control system will come with the remote control itself that you'll use to pilot your drone.",
        "Check to see if your system takes off-the-shelf batteries or is rechargeable.",
        "You'll need to power it to connect it to your flight control system.",
        "Connect the motors to the speed controllers.",
        "Run the wires from the motors to their respective speed controllers on the underside of the drone's frame so power can be transferred into the motors once you power the drone up.",
        "While these connections may vary from brand to brand, they are usually a simple male/female connection that just needs to be pressed together.",
        "If your components don't have a simple connector, refer to the instruction manual for the speed controller to assess the best way to connect them.",
        "You may need to solder the wire directly to a port on the motor itself.",
        "If so, check the manual for the motor as well, to ensure you're soldering the wire to the correct port.",
        "Charge the drone battery.",
        "Use the power supply that came with your battery to plug it into a wall outlet.",
        "Leave it plugged in until it reaches a maximum charge (usually four hours, but refer to the instructions that came with your battery to check for your specific application).",
        "You'll need the drone's flight controller powered to connect it to the remote control system.",
        "Many drone operators choose to purchase and charge multiple batteries, as each one will only power the drone in flight for a few minutes before needing to be recharged again.",
        "Link the remote control system to the flight controller.",
        "Follow the instructions that came with your remote control system to establish a link between the remote control and the flight controller mounted on the drone.",
        "On many applications, this connection is easy to establish: simply hold the sync button on both the remote control and the flight controller while they're near each other and the two will link up.",
        "Fly your drone in the air.",
        "Turn on both the drone (using the switch on the flight controller) and the radio control.",
        "Drone controls usually have at least two joysticks: the left stick controls the yaw (or the direction the drone is pointed) by moving left to right, and the throttle by going forward and backward.",
        "The right stick controls the roll (left to right) and the pitch (pointing the \u201cnose\u201d down or up).",
        "Use the left stick to control speed and direction.",
        "Use the right stick to control the orientation of the drone (leaning left or right, angled up or down)."
