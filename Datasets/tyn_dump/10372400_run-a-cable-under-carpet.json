It\u2019s a good idea to make a careful decision about where you want to run your cable, to avoid creating a trip hazard. You may even want to make a sketch of the room before beginning to help you visualize the best spot to place the cable. Consider running your cable along a wall where it will be inconspicuous. There may even be a hollow space there which will make it easy to tuck the cable out of sight. Avoid placing the cable under heavy furniture, and try to minimize the distance that your cable has to travel."

Guiding Draw Wire Under the Carpet Pull up the carpet where you want to begin threading the cable. Try to lift only a small section of carpet up. It may be helpful to use pliers to lift the carpet. If your cable is already permanently attached to an appliance, pull up the carpet on the opposite end of the path from where the attached cable is located.

Pulling the Cable Through Attach the cable to the fish tape. On the end of the fish tape that you just pulled out from under the carpet, there should be a hook which you can attach to your cable.

Your cable should now run along your desired path underneath your carpet! You can now hook the cable up as you please. Reattach carpet liner if necessary.
