If the boots still aren\u2019t stretched enough, you can try the process again to expand them even further. Leave the boots filled with newspaper until you plan to wear them. Heating the Boots Wear a pair of thick socks and put on the rubber boots. Use a really thick pair of socks to help stretch out the rubber material when you heat them up. Put on the boots so you can flex your feet and walk around in them after you heat them up. If the boots are so tight that you can\u2019t wear a pair of thick socks and put them on, wear a pair of thin socks instead. Run a blow dryer on high-heat over the boots to loosen the material. Take a blow dryer set to high-heat and hold it about 6\u20138 inches (15\u201320 cm) away from the surface of the boots. Keep the blow dryer constantly moving over the boots to heat up and loosen the rubber material so they stretch out. Keep heating the boots until they loosen up enough to feel comfortable.

While you\u2019re moving the blow dryer back and forth over the surface of the boots, raise your toes and flex your heel to help the material stretch out to form a more comfortable fit. As the rubber warms up, the material will loosen and become more comfortable as you move.Tip: Have a friend aim the blow dryer at your boots while you stand in them and flex your feet and heels so you can stretch them for a more natural fit. Take a 30-minute walk to stretch out the rubber material. Once the boots feel looser and more comfortable, go for a nice long walk to help break them into their new fit. As the rubber cools, it will start to harden and retain its new shape and fit. Using a Boot Stretcher Insert a closed boot stretcher into the toe area of the boot. A boot stretcher is a device with a wooden block shaped like the inside of a boot and a handle that rotates to open the block. Make sure the stretcher is completely closed and slide it all the way into the boot so it\u2019s in the toe at the front of the boot.
