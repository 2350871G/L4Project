Floor polish is the cheapest and easiest option, but the glitter may fall off over time. The ornament also won't be as sparkly as polycrylic. Polycrylic is trickier to use, but it offers a permanent hold and helps bring out the colors of the glitter. Can't find floor polish or polycrylic? Try a decoupage glue, such as Mod Podge.
