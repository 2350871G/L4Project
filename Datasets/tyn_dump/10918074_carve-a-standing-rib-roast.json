Using a carving knife or another sharp tool, make an incision in the white fat cap along the edge of the roast. Hold the roast down with your hand as you cut horizontally across it, removing most of the fat in one cut. Peel back the layer of fat as you go to help you keep track of your knife. Leave at least a \u20448 in (0.32 cm) layer of fat in place to keep the roast moist. You can also leave this layer on after the roast cooks, or you can remove it if you wish."
