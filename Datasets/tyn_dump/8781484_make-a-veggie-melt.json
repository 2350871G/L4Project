After you've mixed and seasoned the veggies in the skillet, let them cook for approximately 5 minutes, or until they become tender. Stir the veggies occasionally to ensure that they cook evenly. Stir in the garlic and kale, and cook the mixture until the kale wilts. When the veggies are tender, add a minced clove of garlic and 3 cups (300 g) of shredded kale leaves.

You can saute the veggies up to a day in advance. Place them in a covered container and store in the refrigerator, but bring them to room temperature before assembling the sandwiches. Assembling the Sandwiches Apply some butter to one side of the bread slices. To assemble the sandwiches, lay out 8 pieces of your favorite bread. Use 2 tablespoons (28 g) of softened, unsalted butter to cover one side of each piece. Some breads that work well for the veggie melts include sourdough, whole-grain, and Italian. For the best results, though, make sure the slices are at least \u00bd-inch (13-mm) thick. Spread the mayo spread on the other side of the bread slices. After you've applied the butter to one side of the bread slices, turn them over. Add the mayonnaise-mustard spread that you made earlier to the other side, and place the bread, butter-side down, onto the preheated baking sheet from the oven. Make sure to use a potholder or oven mitt to remove the baking sheet from the oven because it will be extremely hot. Top half of the bread slices with the veggies. After you've set the bread slices out on the baking sheet, divide the veggie mixture between four slices of the bread. Spread them in an even layer over the mayo-mustard mixture so the vegetables don't fall out the sides. You should have four slices of bread that don't have any veggie topping on them when you're done. Sprinkle the cheese over the veggies. Once the veggies are spread on the bread slices, divide 1 \u00bd cups (170 g) of grated Gouda cheese between the covered slices. Sprinkle the cheese evenly over the veggies so they're all covered. You can substitute another cheese for the Gouda if you prefer. Mozzarella, Swiss, and Havarti are tasty options. Baking the Sandwiches Bake the sandwiches until the cheese is melted. After you've layered the veggies and cheese on half of the bread, return the baking sheet to the preheated oven. Allow the sandwiches to bake for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the cheese melts and is bubbling. If you prefer, you can grill the sandwiches in a nonstick saute pan. Put both pieces of bread together first, and then heat them on medium for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until the cheese melts. Top the veggie and cheese covered bread with the other slices.

When you place the untopped bread slices over the topped pieces, make sure to set them down with the mayo-mustard spread-covered side face down. Cut each sandwich in half and serve. When the sandwiches are closed, use a sharp knife to cut each one in half. Place the melts on individual plates, and serve. The veggie melts pair very well with soups, especially tomato.",
