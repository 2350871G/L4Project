                    "description": "Think about what you plan to carry and how big the trailer needs to be to carry it. Draw a sketch of the outline of the trailer and write down the length and width.Tip: Don\u2019t make the trailer any wider than about the width of your shoulders or it will be very hard to maneuver with. Don\u2019t make the trailer any longer than about 3 ft (0.91 m) or it will be difficult to tow. You will need to have a pair of matching bicycle wheels for the trailer already so you can use them to space the side pieces of the frame after you cut all the pieces to size. For example, if you have a bin of some kind that you want to be able to tow, you can measure the bin and make the trailer at least large enough to hold it. If you want to haul a plastic tub that is 24 in (61 cm) by 18 in (46 cm) big, you could make the trailer about 26 in (66 cm) long by 20 in (51 cm) wide. An example of dimensions you can use if you don\u2019t have a specific size in mind is 32 in (81 cm) long by 22 in (56 cm) wide. This will give you a manageable trailer with plenty of room to haul stuff like groceries or tools."

It\u2019s best not to use plywood any thicker than 0.25 in (0.64 cm) or you will end up adding a lot of weight to the trailer. The plywood creates a bed on the frame of the trailer that you can set things on to haul them. You can use ropes or bungee cords to secure items or put some kind of bin on the trailer bed to hold things. Again, if you don\u2019t have the tools to cut the plywood yourself, just provide the measurements to the staff at a home improvement center or lumber yard and have them cut the trailer bed for you."

Repeat this for 3 more electrical box plate covers.Tip: If you can\u2019t find electrical box plate covers, any thin pieces of pliable metal that are at least 4.5 in (11 cm) long by at least 2.75 in (7.0 cm) wide will work. You just need to be able to bend the pieces and drill holes in them easily. Electrical box plate covers are thin, flat pieces of metal that are normally used to cover electrical boxes. They work well for this because they are easy to bend and work with. You can purchase them at a home improvement center or online. Once the wheels are bolted to the plates, the plates will be attached by screwing them to the plywood deck and into the innermost side pieces of the frame, so the wheels are held in place and sticking up through the gaps in the plywood deck of the trailer."

        "Repeat this for 3 more electrical box plate covers.Tip: If you can\u2019t find electrical box plate covers, any thin pieces of pliable metal that are at least 4.5 in (11 cm) long by at least 2.75 in (7.0 cm) wide will work.",
        "You just need to be able to bend the pieces and drill holes in them easily.",
        "Electrical box plate covers are thin, flat pieces of metal that are normally used to cover electrical boxes.",
        "They work well for this because they are easy to bend and work with.",
        "You can purchase them at a home improvement center or online.",
        "Once the wheels are bolted to the plates, the plates will be attached by screwing them to the plywood deck and into the innermost side pieces of the frame, so the wheels are held in place and sticking up through the gaps in the plywood deck of the trailer.",
        "Drill axle holes 0.5 in (1.3 cm) up from the bottom edge of each plate.",
        "Measure 0.5 in (1.3 cm) up from the bottom edge, then measure an even distance towards the center from each side and make a mark.",
        "Use an electric drill with a metal drill bit that is the same size as the wheels\u2019 axles to drill a hole in each plate.",
        "Standard electrical box plate covers are at least 4.5 in (11 cm) long, so drilling the holes 0.5 in (1.3 cm) up from the bottom will ensure that the axles have plenty of clearance between them and the wood of the frame.",
        "Drill screw holes in the metal plates to attach them to the frame.",
        "Use a metal drill bit the size of your wood screws to drill 2 holes in the bent part of each metal plate.",
        "Drill 2 holes, offset from the 2 holes at the top, in the side of each metal plate.",
        "The exact positioning of the holes doesn\u2019t matter, so don\u2019t worry about measuring them.",
        "Just make sure to offset the side holes enough from the top holes so the screws don\u2019t intersect in the wood.",
        "Bolt the metal plates onto the wheels.",
        "Slide a metal plate onto each side of the wheels\u2019 axles using the holes you drilled for the axles.",
        "Secure the wheels in place on the metal plates by twisting the wheel nuts onto the ends of the axles.",
        "If your wheels don\u2019t have nuts, you can order some bicycle wheel nuts online or buy some at a bike shop.",
        "Screw the metal plate brackets into place on the side pieces of the frame.",
        "Position the brackets on top of the frame with the wheels sticking through the gaps in the plywood trailer bed.",
        "Drive 0.5\u20130.75 in (1.3\u20131.9 cm) wood screws through the screw holes you drilled in the plates to attach them to the frame.",
        "It\u2019s easiest to do this if you set the trailer on top of something to raise it up so the wheels clear the ground when you position them.",
        "You can use something like cinder blocks or bricks to do this.",
        "Adding a Trailer Arm Purchase a bicycle trailer arm and hitch.",
        "Browse bike shops or search online for kits that come with the two parts or look for a separate arm and hitch that are compatible.",
        "Buy the parts and take them home or order them online ad wait for them to arrive.Tip: You could also try to find a cheap or free second-hand bike trailer and remove the arm and hitch from it to use.",
        "For example, you could find an old kid-hauling trailer at a thrift shop and repurpose the hitch and arm from it for your needs.",
        "This can cost anywhere from about $30-$100 USD if you purchase the parts online.",
        "Attach the trailer hitch to the rear left wheel hub of your bike.",
        "Remove the nut from the left side of the rear wheel hub on your bicycle.",
        "Slide the hitch onto the end of the wheel\u2019s axle, where you just removed the wheel nut from, then reattach the nut to hold everything in place.",
        "This applies to side-mounted trailer hitches that go on the rear wheel hub on the left side of the bike.",
        "There are also some trailer hitch and arm kits that attach higher up to the rear seat post that you can try if you prefer.",
        "Screw the trailer arm onto the left side of the trailer.",
        "Position the arm on the left side of the trailer, against the outer piece of the frame, as far forward as the screw holes will let you put it.",
        "Attach it to the frame by driving the provided screws through the holes into the wood of the frame using an electric drill.",
        "Always refer to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for any special mounting guidelines.",
        "Couple the arm and the hitch.",
        "Insert the end of trailer\u2019s arm into the hitch to connect them.",
        "Secure the arm in place in the hitch by sliding the pin through the hole in the hitch.",
        "Snap any straps in place or tighten any other connecting hardware.",
        "The exact method for coupling the arm and hitch varies depending on the model and brand.",
        "Always refer to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for specific directions about safely securing the trailer to the hitch."
