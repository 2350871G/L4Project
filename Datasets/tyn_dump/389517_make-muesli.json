Start by putting 4 cups (560g) of your grain of choice in a large bowl or container. If you\u2019re using oats, make sure that you use rolled oats and not quick-cooking grains which will be highly processed. Any rolled grain will work great for a muesli base. Try rolled oats, barley, rye, spelt, or rice in whatever ratio you think tastes best! Muesli is made to be customized."

Add 1 cup (120g) of whatever kind of chopped nuts you prefer to the grains.

Chop up your dried fruit or fruits of choice and add 1 cup (150g) to the grains and nuts. Dates, raisins, dehydrated berries, or even dried mango or papaya pieces all make great additions to muesli. Choose fruits that you like and try different combinations until you find the perfect recipe. Try to find dried fruits without added sugar. As none of the other ingredients are particularly sweet, the fruit should add enough sweetness without relying on more sugar. Only add dried fruit to your muesli recipe, as fresh fruit in it will soften your muesli and make it turn bad much more quickly. If you want to add fresh fruit, do so just before you eat it."
