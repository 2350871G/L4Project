Consider which features you will want to pay the most attention to, and then determine your skin tone and the colors that might work best:\n\nPale skin: use light colors. For your eyeshadow, a shade approximately 2-3 times darker than your natural skin tone may work best. Consider a dash of gold or bronze in the inner corner of your eye to brighten up your eyes, light brush, and mascara that is lighter on the bottom lashes than the top. Tan skin: light browns will work well with eyeshadow, and pink or silver on the outer side of your eye can make your eyes pop. Your lips might benefit from lip balm/gloss that is darker in color, like a deep cherry. When considering blush, apply only lightly, and contemplate leaving out eyeliner. Dark skin: brown and pinks might be the thing for you. These colors go well on the eyelid, with dark brown being applied in the crease. Coral or orange colors do well with darker skin tones on the lips. Avoid mascara on the bottom lashes. Wear dark blush."
