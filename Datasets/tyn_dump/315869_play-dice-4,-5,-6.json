The banker has slightly better odds of winning, but puts up a larger stake. Set the stake. The banker puts up a bet of any amount. If you like, your group can decide on a minimum stake. Match the stake. Each other dice player gets a chance to match some or all of the stake. Move on once the full stake is matched, or when no one else wants to put up a bet. Here are a couple examples:\n\nExample 1: The banker puts up $25. Player one matches $15 of that stake, and player two puts up $10. The full $25 stake is matched, so no one else can bet.

Any three of a kind (\"trips\"): automatic win. Any pair + 6: automatic win. (For example, 1 + 1 + 6 or 3 + 3 + 6.) 1 + 2 + 3 exactly: automatic loss.

If the banker didn't roll one of the combinations above, the round continues. Find the banker's score:\nAny pair + a 2, 3, 4, or 5: the banker's score equals the value of the third die. (For example, 1 + 1 + 4 gives a score of 4. A roll of 5 + 5 + 3 gives a score of 3.) Any other result: the banker rolls all three dice again until she gets a \"decision roll:\" a score, an automatic win, or an automatic loss. Try to beat the banker's score. If the banker rolled a score (not an automatic win or loss), each player gets a chance to roll three dice to try and beat it.

If money is still on the table due to a tie, it stays on the table unless the banker changes (see below). If the banker changes, the betting players pick up their stakes instead. Start the next round, using the same rules. Switch bankers. Some groups rotate the banker position clockwise each round. Others let the banker keep the position until someone rolls a 4-5-6. That person then takes over the banker position starting next round. The old banker becomes an ordinary player. The banker role is always optional. A player can choose to turn it down. Playing without a Banker Place your bets. In this version of the game, there is no banker. Each player puts a matching stake into a single pot. These rules are recommended for two player games, or for groups looking for a more tense game with a top-heavy prize. Roll until you get a result. Roll all three dice until you get a 1, 6, pair, or triple. For any other result, reroll all three dice until you get one of these results. Have each opponent roll. Each player rolls in turn, following the same rules. Roll until everyone has a meaningful score (a 1, 6, pair, or triple). Compare your results. In this version, there are no automatic wins or automatic losses. Whoever has the higher result wins the pot. Here are the results from highest to lowest:\n4+5+6 is the highest roll. 6+6+6 is the next highest, followed by all the \"trips\" from 5+5+5 down to 1+1+1. Any pair + 6, down to any pair + 1. 1+2+3 is the lowest roll. Shootout to break a tie. If two or more players tie for the highest score, they each reroll to break the tie. The highest reroll wins, ignoring the earlier rolls. There's also a special rule for breaking ties with \"pair + third die:\"\nThe higher third die always wins, no matter what the pairs are. 1 + 1 + 4 beats 6 + 6 + 2, because 4 > 2. If the third die is the same, the higher pair wins. 3 + 3 + 5 beats 2 + 2 + 5, since 3 > 2. Give the pot to the winner. Whoever got the highest roll that round wins the entire pot.
