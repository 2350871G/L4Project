Remove piles of dead leaves, grass clippings, piles of wood, boxes, tires, plywood, and empty containers from the yard. It is especially essential that you remove debris from around the perimeter of your home's foundation in order to keep spiders out of your house. If you want to keep spiders away from your yard as much as possible, though, you should remove these items from your yard altogether."

Trimming your weeds and cutting your grass short will reduce the number of spiders in your yard by creating a less appealing habitat. You do not need to get rid of your shrubs and bushes completely, but you should at least avoid planting them next to the foundation of your house to limit the number of spiders wandering inside."

Reducing the number of items you store outdoors will also reduce the number of spiders you spot. If you do plan to store something outside, put it into a sealed plastic container instead of a cardboard box. Sealed containers prevent most spiders from squeezing inside, so you will have fewer unpleasant surprises to deal with when you open the container later on. Check boxes stored outdoors before you bring them into the house."

In most instances, you will need to remove the web with a broom, mop, or garden hose. If you are near enough to an electrical outlet, you can also use a vacuum to remove webs and egg sacs you spot outside."

Use your outdoor lights as little as possible. Direct the lights away from your house to draw the insects and spiders further away from your foundation. Switch to yellow bulbs. The softer light is less appealing to insects and may not draw as many as a bright white light does."

Weather stripping and door sweeps will seal the gaps left at the bottom and sides of your doors and windows. Door sweeps are especially important because you cannot use caulk to cover the crack at the bottom of the doorway, making a properly fit door sweep your only means of cutting that path off from spiders. A tight-fitting screen is also an essential tool. Spiders can slip in through the gaps left by loose screens, and so can many insects spiders like to feed on. Install screens over your windows and vents. Repair any holes in your screens as soon as you spot them. If you spot a hole in your screen, repair it or replace the screen. Otherwise, spiders and insects may find their way into your home through that hole."

Do not use cardboard boxes. If you must rely on cardboard boxes, however, cover all exposed openings with packing tape. Good storage methods are especially important for items stored in a dark basement or attic. Consider storing outdoor tools and sports equipment in sealed storage containers, as well. This includes roller skates, gardening tools and clothing, ski boots, and team uniforms. If you do not want to store these items in plastic bins, store them in a large plastic bag with a tight seal and no holes. Cover all sources of pet and human food. Spiders are not interested in human and pet food, but insects that spiders feed on are very interested in these food sources. As a result, keeping food hidden away in sealed bags and containers will attract fewer insects, thereby attracting fewer spiders."

If you mix these oils with dish soap and warm water, you can create a repellent that may ward away most common house spiders. Peppermint essential oil is the most popular option, but you can also try tea tree oil, citrus oil, lavender oil, or neem oil. The idea is that the above mentioned essential oils have potent smells that are unappealing to spiders. You need to add dish soap to make the solution more effective. The soap breaks apart the oil molecules, allowing the oil to mix more consistently throughout the water. Use 5 to 10 drops of essential oil. Put the essential oil in a 16-oz (500-ml) spray bottle and fill the bottle to the brim with warm water. Place the cap back on the bottle and shake to combine. Use this spray along openings spiders may squeeze in through, including window frames and door cracks. Reapply every few days, or as the odor fades."
