If you have a stain that covers a large portion of the aluminum, it is often best to soak the piece in the acid for 1 to 2 hours. If you are removing a small stain or do not have a tank big enough for your piece to fit in, you can put your acid on a rag and rub gently back and forth. Do not go in a circular motion, as this can cause the aluminum to look uneven in the finished product."

Put as little force into the scrubbing as possible to minimize scratches on your aluminum surface. Sometimes, steel wool is used as a more serious abrasive. If you feel that you need to do this, you should look for the finest grade of steel wool that you can buy and be very gentle with it. Scratches in your aluminum will allow things to get stuck on even worse in the future."
