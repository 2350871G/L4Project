        "Grab a paper towel and blot the water off of the turkey before you season it to ensure that the seasoning sticks to the skin.",
        "Any additional bacteria on the turkey will cook off during the roasting, so don\u2019t worry about trying to get the bird completely clean.",
        "Avoid running water over the turkey or using a kitchen towel to clean it, as this can spread bacteria throughout your kitchen from drips or splashes of the contaminated water.",
        "Apply a dry brine for seasoned, crispy skin.",
        "For an easy dry brine, combine 0.5 teaspoons (2.5 mL) of kosher salt per 1 pound (0.45 kg) of turkey with 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of black pepper and the zest of a lemon.",
        "Then, rub the salt mixture all over the bird and let sit for at least an hour.",
        "You can allow the brine to sit on the turkey for up to 2 days before cooking, and you can apply the brine even when the turkey is thawing.",
        "You can add extra black pepper or other seasonings to taste!",
        "Make a wet brine instead for moister skin.",
        "For a wet brine, place the turkey in a large pot, combine 0.5 teaspoons (2.5 mL) of kosher salt per 1 pound (0.45 kg) of turkey with 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of black pepper and the zest of a lemon, and fill the pot with water until the turkey is submerged.",
        "As the turkey is marinating in the water and brine, place it in the refrigerator to keep the temperature at a safe level.",
        "EXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Hong\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExecutive Chef & Restaurant Owner\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Hong is the Executive Chef and Co-Owner of Sorrel, a New American restaurant in San Francisco.",
        "He has been working in restaurants for over ten years.",
        "Alex is a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, and has worked in the kitchens of Jean-Georges and Quince, both Michelin-starred restaurants.",
        "Alex Hong\t\t\tExecutive Chef & Restaurant Owner\t\t\t\tLet the turkey dry after you brine it to get a crispier skin.",
        "Alex Hong, the Executive Chef at Sorrel, says: \"To make the perfect bird, brine the whole turkey overnight.",
        "That really tenderizes the meat and makes it juicier.",
        "Then, give it about a day to dry out in the refrigerator.",
        "All the flavor and salt will still be in the flesh, but the skin will be able to get really crispy in the oven.",
        "Also, I like to put the turkey in a really hot oven, then bring the temperature back down to cook it low and slow.\"",
        "Stuff the turkey if you want a savory side dish for the turkey.",
        "Stuffing is a bread mixture that can be cooked inside of the turkey to absorb the juices.",
        "To make the stuffing, simply mix 4 cups (950 mL) of scored bread, 1 cup (240 mL) of chopped celery, and 1 chopped onion together, and use your hands to completely fill the cavity of the turkey by packing the mixture into it.",
        "Be aware that stuffing will add extra cook time to the recipe.",
        "Add an extra 30 minutes to the cook time if your turkey is stuffed.",
        "Truss the turkey to ensure evening cooking.",
        "Trussing is the process of using twine to tie the legs and wings to the turkey.",
        "It ensures that the turkey cooks evenly on all parts.",
        "To truss the bird, secure the wings to the turkey by wrapping baker\u2019s twine around the body of the turkey, then cross the twine under the bottom of the bird.",
        "Finally, tie the legs together.",
        "You can also truss a stuffed bird to keep the stuffing from coming out of the cavity while the turkey is in the roaster.",
        "Cooking the Turkey Heat the oven to 450 \u00b0F (232 \u00b0C) while the turkey reaches room temperature.",
        "To properly roast a turkey, keep it in the kitchen for an hour to reach room temperature before you cook it.",
        "Place it on a dish or baking sheet out of the way while you preheat the oven and prepare the rest of the kitchen for cooking the turkey.",
        "If you\u2019re short on time, it\u2019s acceptable to let the turkey sit for about 30 minutes to get it close to room temperature.",
        "Add hard apple cider and dry white wine to the bottom of the roasting pan.",
        "Fill the pan to a depth of about 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) with equal parts of the liquids.",
        "You should use about 12 fluid ounces (350 mL) of each liquid, depending on the size of your pan.",
        "Stir the cider and wine in the bottom of the pan with a spoon to make sure they\u2019re evenly distributed.",
        "This will add moisture and flavor to the meat while it\u2019s cooking without making the skin too crispy.",
        "Place the onion, garlic cloves, and bay leaves into the liquid.",
        "Incorporating 1 quartered onion, 6 smashed and peeled cloves of garlic, and 3 bay leaves will add more flavor to the meat as it roasts.",
        "Mix them into the liquid with the spoon so that they\u2019re evenly distributed on the bottom of the pan.",
        "Some of the onion and garlic might stick out of the liquid.",
        "They\u2019ll soften and incorporate into the juices as the turkey roasts.",
        "Brush the skin of the turkey with olive oil or butter.",
        "Apply enough oil or butter to completely coat the turkey, including the insides of the wings and legs and any small crevices.",
        "Depending on the size of the turkey, you will need around 1 cup (240 mL) of either oil or butter.",
        "You might need to slightly adjust the positioning of the turkey to get all of the skin.",
        "Covering the turkey with a fat, like oil or butter, makes the skin crispy but not burnt.",
        "If you like moist skin on your turkey, apply less oil or butter.",
        "Place the turkey breast-side up on the roasting rack set inside of the pan.",
        "Be gentle when transferring the turkey to the pan.",
        "Try to avoid moving the turkey too much as this can cause the trussing to come undone or the stuffing to spill out.",
        "It\u2019s okay if the legs or side of the turkey touch the roasting pan.",
        "Add foil to the pan and lower the temperature to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) after 30 minutes.",
        "Set a timer when the turkey is in the oven to remind you to cover it with foil after the first 30 minutes pass.",
        "Lowering the temperature and covering the turkey keeps the skin from burning and helps to cook the meat evenly.",
        "Be careful when removing the turkey from the oven!",
        "Always use oven mitts and make sure you have enough space to place the roasting pan on the counter while you cover it with foil.",
        "Roast the turkey for 3 hours or until the internal temperature is 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C).",
        "The cook time of the turkey will depend on how large it is, but the general rule is 20 minutes per 1 pound (0.45 kg).",
        "Insert the thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh of the turkey about 15 minutes before the end of the cook time to ensure that it\u2019s cooked all the way through.",
        "For example, if you have an unstuffed 10 to 18 lb (4.5 to 8.2 kg) turkey, plan on cooking for about 3.5-4 hours.",
        "Remember to add 30 minutes of extra cook time for a stuffed turkey.",
        "Remove the turkey from the oven and let it sit for 30 minutes before carving.",
        "When the turkey comes out of the oven, it will be extremely hot.",
        "It\u2019s not safe to carve it at this temperature, so let it cool down a bit in the pan on the counter.",
        "If you\u2019re worried about the turkey getting too cold, keep it covered with the aluminum foil while it rests.",
        "You can let the turkey sit on the counter for up to an hour before carving while you make gravy or prepare other parts of your dinner!",
        "Finished."
