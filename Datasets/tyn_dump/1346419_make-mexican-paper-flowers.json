Keep folding in alternate directions, as though you were making a paper fan. Continue until the entire stack forms an accordion fold. Optionally, trim the ends into a point, rounded end, or V-shaped notch. These effects create a flower with distinct petals, instead of a fluffy carnation. You can even make a second layer in green paper, cutting it into sharp points to form leaves.
