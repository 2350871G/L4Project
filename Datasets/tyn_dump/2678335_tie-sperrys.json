    "text": " Tying a Barrel Knot Fold the lace to form a loop. Take the left shoe lace of either shoe in your hand. Fold the lace over itself to create a loop. Leave a 3 to 4 inch tail on the end of the loop. Twist the loop. Place the top of the loop between the thumb and index finger of your non-dominant hand. With your dominant hand, hold the tail just below the base of the loop. Tightly twist the loop with your non-dominant hand. If needed, wrap the tail around the loop additional times. Wrap the tail 5 times around the loop. Continue to hold the top of the loop with your non-dominant hand. With your dominant hand, wrap the tail around the base of the loop 5 times. Insert the end of the lace through the loop and pull. Grab the end of the lace with your dominant hand. Thread the end through the loop. As you pull the end tightly through the loop, use your non-dominant hand to push the knot towards the shoe. Repeat on the remaining laces. Tie barrel knots in the 3 remaining laces. Trim the laces. If the laces are uneven, dragging on the floor, or just look too long, you may trim the laces. Use a pair of sharp scissors to cut off the excess from the leather laces. Tying a Tassel Knot Cross the laces. Create an \u201cX\u201d with your laces by placing the left lace on top of the right lace. Bring the left lace under the right lace. Pull the laces in opposite directions. Tie a square knot. Take the left lace in your left hand and the right lace in your right hand. Make sure the right lace is on top of the left lace. Bring the right lace under the left lace. Pull it back over the left lace. Bring the left lace under the right lace. Pull it back over the right lace. Tighten the knot by simultaneously pulling evenly on each lace. Form a loop with the left lace. Fold the left lace over itself to form a loop at the base of the square knot. The loop should be approximately 1 inch in length. Hold the base of the loop between the thumb and index finger of your non-dominant hand. Wrap the tail around the loop 2 or 3 times. Grab the tail with your dominant hand. Wrap the lace tightly around the loop 2 to 3 times. Tuck the end in the loop and pull. Thread the end of the lace through the loop. Pull tightly on the lace. Repeat on the right lace. Create a tassel on the right lace using the same process. Trim the ends if needed. Tie the other shoe. Create two tassel knots on the other Sperry. Tying a Chain Knot Make a loop with your left lace. Uncross your laces. Grab the left lace with your non-dominant hand. With your dominant hand make a \u00bd inch loop in the middle of your left lace. Hold the base of the loop with your left hand. Create a second loop and thread it through the first loop. With your dominant hand, create a second \u00bd inch loop above the first loop. Push the base of the second loop halfway through the first loop. Pull the lace tight and move the knot towards the eyelet. Insert the thumb of your non-dominant hand into the second loop. Grab the tail with your dominant hand. Pull the loop and the tail in opposite directions. Push the knot towards the eyelet. Create another loop and thread it through the second loop. Use your dominant hand to make a third loop above the second loop. Bring the loop under and through the second loop. Thread the end through the third loop and pull tight. Take the  third loop in your non-dominant hand. With your dominant hand, thread the end of the lace through the loop. Pull tight to create a link of chains. Evenly space the links by hand. Repeat with the right lace. Complete the process of tying a chain knot with the right lace. Try to make the chains as even as possible. Tuck the ends into the shoe. Pull the left chain horizontally to the right. Lift the right flap and tuck the left lace\u2019s end into the shoe. Position the right chain above the left chain. Pull the right chain horizontally to the left. Lift the left flap and tuck the end of the right lace into the shoe. Tie the other shoe. Create a chain knot on the other Sperry. Tying a Surgeon\u2019s Knot Create a left-over-right starting knot. Cross the left lace over the right lace. Wrap the left lace over and under the right lace. Pull both laces tightly in opposite directions. Make a loop with the left lace. Bend the left lace (now located on the right side of the shoe) over itself to form a 1 inch loop. Position the base of the loop next to the starting knot. Circle the loop with the right lace. Grab the right lace (now located on the left side of the shoe). Bring the right lace in front of the loop. Complete the circle around the base of the loop by bringing the right lace to the front. Insert the right lace into the circle you created and pull. Make a small loop in the right lace. Insert the top of the loop through the circle you created. Pull the loop loosely through the circle. Up to this point you have completed a standard shoelace knot. Wrap the right loop around the left loop again. Bring the right loop over and around the left loop. Insert the right loop through the circle once again. Pull tightly on the loops. Grab the right loop with your right hand and the left loop with your left hand. Pull tightly on the loops in opposite directions. Tie the other shoe. Tie a surgeon\u2019s knot on the other Sperry. Tying a Fishtail Thread the laces through the eyelets in parallel lines. Insert the left lace into and through the bottom left eyelet. String the left lace through the top left eyelet. Insert the right lace into and through the bottom right eyelet. String the right lace through the top right eyelet. The laces between the two eyelets should be visible on the outside of the Sperry. Cross the laces and pull them down towards the tip of the shoe. Lay the left lace over the right lace. Lay the laces flat with the ends towards the tip of the Sperry. Loop the left lace over the right parallel line. Thread the left lace up and over the right parallel line. Pull it tight. Loop the right lace over the left parallel line. Thread the right lace up and over the left parallel line. Pull it tight. Loop each lace up and over the opposite parallel line 3 times. Pull the laces up and over the opposite parallel lines 3 times each. Pull the left lace (now on the right side) up and over the left parallel line. Pull the right lace (now on the left side) up and over the right parallel line. Pull the left lace (now on the left side) up and over the right parallel line. Pull the right lace (now on the right side) up and over the left parallel line. Pull the left lace (now on the right side) up and over the left parallel line. Pull the right lace (now on the left side) up and over the right parallel line. Tuck the ends into the shoe. Insert the left lace into the shoe. Tuck the right lace into the Sperry. Tie the other shoe. Create a fishtail on the other Sperry.",
