Visit your local grocery store or farmer\u2019s market, and examine the produce to see which ones most appeal to you. Starfruit is an ideal option for painting because of its star shape. Chinese cabbage can create rose-like shapes when they\u2019re cut. Broccoli and cauliflower work well for painting because of their florets. Mushrooms come in a variety of shapes that allow for creativity. Apples, pears, bananas, strawberries, raspberries, potatoes, carrots, bell peppers, corn cobs, green beans, oranges, lemons, and limes are other good options."

To make it easier to dip the produce into the paint, transfer it into disposable shallow containers, such as a plate or dish. Fill a plate with each shade of paint that you plan to use.

When you\u2019re pressing the fruit and vegetable pieces to the paper that you\u2019re working on, it has a tendency to shift around. Keep it steady by securing it to your table, counter, or other work surface with double-sided tape. You can use any type of paper that you like for your canvas, such as sketch paper, poster board, or cardstock. Blot the cut produce and set out them out on a plate. When you\u2019re ready to start painting, gather all of the fruit and vegetable that you\u2019ve cut on a plate. Use a piece of paper towel to gently blot the cut sides to remove any moisture that might dilute the paint. Creating a Picture Dip the produce into the paint. When you\u2019re ready to start painting, place the cut side of the fruit or vegetable into the paint. Make sure that the piece is covered evenly with a thin coat of paint. You can use a paintbrush or sponge to apply the paint to the produce instead of dipping it to ensure that it\u2019s evenly distributed. If you apply too much paint to the fruit and vegetable pieces, it can seep up around the produce and create a messy, indistinct shape when you press it onto the paper. Aim for a light layer of paint.
