Clean the knife and cutting board with hot water and soap, and be sure to rinse both off thoroughly.

A chopping knife works well but is not required. It's important to only use a sharp knife so you can make clean cuts. Peel the vegetable if you want to. Potatoes and carrots are often peeled before being julienned. It is up to you depending on how you plan to eat them.

You can throw the scraps away, or you can slice them up and mix them in with the uniform pieces you'll cut later. This is especially helpful for potatoes, zucchini, and squash.

Each chunk does not have to be the exact same length, just divide the vegetable evenly. The general rule for juliennes is that you'd be able to eat them in one bite, but you can cut them into longer chunks if you want. Slice the vegetable down the length. When cutting juliennes, \u215b in (0.3 cm) to 1/16 in (0.15 cm) is the recommended thickness. Use the knuckles of the hand not holding the knife as a guide for the thickness. Be careful not to cut yourself as you slice. Stack 2-3 slices and cut again. Flip the slices you've just cut so that they are piled on top of each other. Then cut them into sticks that are \u215b in (0.3 cm) to 1/16 in (0.15 cm) thick, again. The goal with juliennes is to get them all to a fairly uniform size. Cutting Onions with a Knife Remove the top and tail portions. The stem and tail pieces aren't needed for juliennes, so cut them off and throw them away.

Onions tend to be a little firmer than many other vegetables, so make sure your knife is sharp before you start. A dull knife will make the process much harder.

Since onions are generally about the size that you want julienne sticks to be lengthwise, there is no need to cut an onion into a rectangle or into chucks. Simply cut it in half from top to bottom.

As you near the halfway point, your knife should be at 90 degrees. Flip the onion on its side and continue cutting. Perform the same process with the second half of the onion. Using a Mandoline Slicer Set up the mandoline on a sturdy surface. Some mandolines have a container to catch the food as it is sliced, but if not, make sure you have a container under it. Set the mandoline on your cutting board, or on the counter or table, and be sure it will not slide around as you slice. Choose your blade and set the thickness.
