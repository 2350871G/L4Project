Make sure all the water is gone so none of it sits on the metal and causes stains. Removing Stubborn Stains Fill a pot of water. Get  a standard kitchen pot you can use to boil water. Pick one that\u2019s big enough to contain the aluminum object, if possible. For objects that do not fit in the pot, boil the water anyway and clean the aluminum in the sink. The temperature of the water does not matter at this point. Add cream of tartar to the water. Place two tablespoons of cream of tartar in the water. Cream of tartar can be found at any general store where baking supplies are sold. Bring the water to a boil. Turn up the heat on the stove until the water boils.

Use a soft cloth or paper towel to ensure that all moisture is removed from the aluminum. Don\u2019t leave any water, or else it may stain the item. Treating Tarnished Aluminum Mix water and white vinegar. In a large stove pot, combine equal amounts of water and white vinegar. Mix the ingredients together, then set the pot on the stove. Add citrus juice to the water. Measure out two or three tablespoons of lime or lemon juice. Dump them into the pot of water. If you don\u2019t have juice, you can slice up a whole lemon and add it to the pot. Bring the water to a boil. Turn up the heat on the stove and allow the water to boil.
