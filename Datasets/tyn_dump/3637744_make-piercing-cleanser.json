After your bottle has been rinsed and dried, pour a large amount of pure sea salt into the bottle. You should use enough so it covers the entire bottom of the container.

Don't use too much, the purpose of this is to get into the piercing and foam out any infection. Peroxide is also good to use as mouthwash if you have a gum infection. Now, pour water into the bottle, filling it up halfway.  Put the lid on your bottle, and shake it gently, paying special attention to the bottom. Make sure all the salt is dissolved.
