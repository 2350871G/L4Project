Start by adding a small, quick squirt of paint to the water. Stir the water vigorously with a wooden stick until the paint dissolves. If you want the color to be more vibrant, add another small squirt of paint to the bath and stir again until it dissolves. Create custom colors by using multiple paint colors in the dye bath. For example, you can easily create a unique shade of chartreuse by mixing green and yellow paint together in the dye bath until you achieve the desired shade. If you're experimenting with color, try mixing the colors together on a palette first. Once you create your desired shade, add the mixed paint to the water."

If you don\u2019t do this, the first piece of felt you try to dye in the bath will end up splotchy and uneven.
