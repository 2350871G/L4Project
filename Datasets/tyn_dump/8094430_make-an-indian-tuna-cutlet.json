You can shape the cutlet into any shape, but most people shape them into ovals. You can also do the flattening after you roll it in the breadcrumbs. Take the oval-shaped (or ball-shaped) mixture and dip it in the egg.  Take the cutlet-dipped egg and roll in breadcrumb. Place on another plate. Repeat until you finish the mixture.
