You can use fresh or used coffee grounds, but make sure that they are dry. The sugar is there for exfoliation. The coarser the sugar is, the more exfoliating the scrub will be. For example, if you want a super-exfoliating scrub, try turbinado sugar. If you have sensitive skin, even normal sugar may be too harsh for you. Try brown sugar instead; it is much softer than other types of sugar."

Allow the oil to cool to room temperature, then stir it into the coffee-sugar mixture. Do not add the coffee-sugar mixture into the oil while it is still hot, or it will dissolve. Coconut oil is very nourishing and moisturizing for skin. If you can't find any coconut oil, or simply don't want to use it, you can try olive oil instead; you don't need to heat it. Coconut oil melts quickly; it should only take 10 to 15 seconds in the microwave, or 1 to 2 minutes over the stove. Coconut oil can clog drains. If you are concerned about this, consider using fractionated coconut oil; it is already in liquid form and doesn't harden."

        "This way, you will free up your muffin tin and will have more space in the freezer.",
        "Use 1 to 2 coffee scrub cubes at 1 time.",
        "When you are ready to use the scrub, take 1 to 2 cubes into the shower with you, then rub them over your body using smooth, circular motions.",
        "The heat from the shower and your skin should cause them to melt quickly.",
        "Rinse the scrub from your skin when you are done.",
        "Plan on using 1 large cube or 2 small cubes.",
        "Like other types of coffee scrubs, this scrub is harsh, so don't use it more than once or twice per week.",
        "Store the scrubs in the freezer when you are not using them.",
        "Not only will this help them keep their form, but it will also keep them dry.",
        "Even if you leave them in the fridge, you may get moisture into the coffee grounds, which can result in mold!",
        "The cubes can last several months in the freezer."
