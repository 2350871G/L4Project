Many general stores sell dusting mitts. They are practically made for blinds and you won't find a better tool for light cleaning. Look for it along with any other cleaning supplies you need. Feather dusters are great ways to do some routine maintenance on your blinds. They are great for reaching higher spots on the blinds with ease but aren't as effective at clearing off individual slats. Other options include paper towels and clothes dryer sheets. Dryer sheets are good because they prevent static electricity that attracts dust. These products need to be swapped out as they get filthy with grime.

Keep the headrail and other metal components out of the water, if possible, to prevent them from rusting. If you don't have space for the blinds in your bathroom, try moving them outside.

Wait for them to become completely dry to the touch before hanging them back up on the wall. To speed up the drying process, wipe the blinds off with a dry cloth. You could also turn a hair dryer down to a very low heat setting and use it. Hold it about 8 in (20 cm) above the blinds and keep it moving.

For a stronger solution, try making a mixture consisting of equal parts water and vinegar. You could also mix in an extra \u20444 cup (59 mL) of a liquid dish soap instead of adding more vinegar. A mild detergent is one designed for general usage instead of cutting through tough grease. Remember to rinse off the soap with clean water when you're done scrubbing the blinds. Dampen a clean cloth or sponge into the mixture. Choose something non-abrasive, such as a piece of cotton or the soft side of a sponge. Old socks make for great scrubbers when used on tough stains. Dip the scrubber into the water to moisten it, but don't soak it or else it will drip water everywhere. If you're using a sock, you could use it to grip the individual slats as you scrub across them. For hard to reach spots, switch to a cotton swab. Cotton buds are great for reaching into tight recesses. Wipe down the blinds until the stains wash off of them. Scrub horizontally along the blinds, starting in the center and working out toward the edge of each stain. Press down with a light amount of pressure so you don't end up bending the slats.

Dry the blinds with a cloth to finish cleaning them. Take a clean cotton cloth to the blinds right after you're done scrubbing, especially if you're working on wood. Sop up any moisture you notice and check to see if the stain disappears. Most stains will go away with a little bit of scrubbing. It also takes care of any remaining dust in the area. Repeated treatments can take care of stubborn stains, but use caution. You're better off performing a deeper cleaning than bending the slats out of place with furious scrubbing. Giving Dirty Blinds a Deep Cleaning Remove the blinds by undoing the brackets at the end of the headrail. The brackets are on the sides of the headrail the slats dangle from. These brackets are relatively easy to pry open with a flat-head screwdriver. Open the bracket and pull the rail toward you to take the  blinds off the wall. Not all blinds have the exact same locking mechanism, so check the owner's manual for more specific instructions. Generally, you do not need anything other than a screwdriver. Deep cleaning is recommended for metallic and synthetic blinds only. This is almost certain to damage wooden blinds, so try it at your own risk! Read the manufacturer's cleaning recommendations for a better solution. Spread the blinds on the floor of a bathtub. Consider laying a towel down on the bathtub floor first if you're worried about scratching the blinds. When you're ready to put them in the tub, lay them as flat as you can on the floor. If the blinds are a little longer than your tub, it's okay to fold the end over a little bit. Keep the headrail and other metal components out of the water, if possible, to prevent them from rusting. If you don't have space for the blinds in your bathroom, try moving them outside. Lawns and driveways are a few good spots for them. Lay out a tarp or blanket first to prevent them from getting even dirtier. Fill the tub with warm water and add a liquid detergent. Let the water flow until it covers the blinds. Then, pour in whatever mild dish detergent you have in your kitchen. About \u20444 cup (59 mL) of it will do. Also, add up to \u20444 cup (59 mL) of white vinegar if you think you will need extra cleaning power to cut through grease on the dirtiest blinds. It isn't a lot of water, but keep some spare towels on hand to deal with any splashes or drips while you're cleaning. If you're cleaning your blinds outside, attach a garden hose to a nearby faucet. Spray down the blinds a few times until they are clean. Leave the blinds to soak for at least half an hour. The amount of time you need to leave the blinds in the water depends on how dirty they are. If you brush dust off of them pretty regularly, it can take as little as 30 minutes. Blinds with a deep build-up of grime may need to be left for 3 hours or more. It's okay to leave the blinds in the water overnight if they really need the spa day. If you're in a hurry, try swishing the blinds around in the water. Use a soft scrub brush to help lift the stains. Scrub stains with a soft brush or sponge to remove them. Soaking may not be enough to remove the toughest stains. Fortunately, scrub brushes can come to your rescue. Make sure you choose something soft that won't scratch the blinds, such as a nylon kitchen brush, non-abrasive sponge, or soft cloth. Scrub along each slat with a gentle amount of pressure until they are all clean. Scrubbing is very useful for blinds done outdoors since you probably won't be able to soak them. Keep scrubbing and spraying them until they are clean. Rinse the blinds with clean water to remove the soap. Drain the tub, then turn on the clean water. A detachable shower head comes in handy here, but you're fine if you don't have one. Try using a bucket to slosh water onto the blinds or let the water spray onto it until the soap is gone. Check both sides for any remaining soap or stains. If you can help it, keep the blinds still as much as possible to avoid any risk of damaging them. If you have to move them, handle them gently and keep a towel under them. Hang the blinds in the air until they dry. If you're lucky enough to have good weather, drape the blinds over a railing, a fence, or some other place exposed to sunlight and circulating air. It will help the blinds dry out more quickly. You could also throw them over a shower railing, garage beam, or some other spot. Wait for them to become completely dry to the touch before hanging them back up on the wall. To speed up the drying process, wipe the blinds off with a dry cloth. You could also turn a hair dryer down to a very low heat setting and use it. Hold it about 8 in (20 cm) above the blinds and keep it moving. Keep the blinds away from heaters and radiators to avoid warping them. Avoid leaving them against hot surfaces.",
