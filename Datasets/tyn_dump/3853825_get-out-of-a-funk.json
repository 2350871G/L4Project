                    "description": "A lack of Vitamin D may result in mild depression (a funk), which is sometimes related to the changing seasons. Fortunately, the sun's rays provide all the Vitamin D that you need. Each day, try to get out in the sun with your face and legs or arms exposed for 20 minutes. That is enough time to absorb Vitamin D without damaging your skin. Most people get this amount of exposure incidentally, for instance while walking to the mailbox or checking the mail. Be sure that you don't overdo the amount of time you spend in the sun without sunscreen. In wintertime especially, some people suffer from what is known as Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) because the short, dark days don't furnish enough Vitamin D. If you find that your funk seems to be related to the changing seasons or dark, dreary winter days, talk to your doctor about SAD and available treatment options, which might include phototherapy using a special light box that mimics the sun's rays."
