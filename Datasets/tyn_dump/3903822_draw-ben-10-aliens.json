    "text": " XLR8 Draw a circle near the right topmost area of the paper.  Draw a triangle near and below this circle, with one of the triangle's corner pointing downward.  Attach a medium quadrilateral polygon on the left side of this triangle. Add a smaller quadrilateral polygon on the left side of the first quadrilateral polygon. By the time you are done, you would have something that will resemble a fish with a large bubble near the top of its nose. From the \"tail\" part of this \"fish,\" draw slim polygons beneath it that will serve as guide shapes for XLR8's legs.  Draw slim triangles for XLR8's arms. Attach a curvy line behind as a guide for his tail. Draw facial guide lines (a vertical line with horizontal lines across it, forming a kind of cross).  Using these line guides, start drawing XLR8's face and bottom part of his helmet. His eyes are shaped like almonds. Complete XLR8's pointy helmet.  Trace XLR8's torso and arms. XLR8's elbows have a single sharp point and his arms have three claw-fingers. Continue tracing XLR8's dog-like legs. At the bottom of each foot is a small round ball. Draw XLR8's tail (resembling that of a lizard). Place the Omnitrix symbol on his chest. Add XLR8's details on his body, tail, and armor.  Remove unnecessary lines.  Color the drawing as desired.  Four Arms Near the topmost and center of the paper, draw a small circle for his head.  Add a spade-shape under the circle to serve as his chin and jaw. Trace a vertical line to the very center of both these shapes, then add three parallel horizontal lines that will intersect this vertical line (forming some sort of a cross). These lines will serve as a guide where the facial features will be placed. Draw a large diagonal oval, tilted northwest going down southeast. Make its center outline intersect with the center of the face's \"cross.\" Draw a medium-sized circle on each of the far corners of the large oval. This will serve as Four Arms' shoulders. Directly below the large oval and aligned with the head, draw a vertical oval of about the similar volume of the first oval. Make this second oval a little bit thicker on the sides and intersecting the first oval. From each of the shoulder circle, draw an angled line that will represent this character's first pair of arms. Let them angle upwards. Draw a circle at the end of each of these lines, to represent his knuckles. Add another pair of arms following the above principle, this time angled downward. Attach these arms just right below the first diagonal oval, but on the side of the second vertical oval. Trace a line in the vertical oval that will identify Four Arms' torso center. Using this as a reference, draw a pair of lines (angled) below the vertical oval as a guide in drawing his legs. Start drawing Four Arms' face: four eyes and open-mouthed (with upper and lower fangs). He also has a running tape in between his eyes, starting from the back of his head and stopping where his nose should be. Start tracing his muscular arms. His arms are furry and his knuckles only have four fingers. Continue tracing the rest of Four Arms' body. Again he is furry, and each of his foot have two fingers. Add clothing and accessory details.  Erase unnecessary lines.  Color the drawing as desired. ",
