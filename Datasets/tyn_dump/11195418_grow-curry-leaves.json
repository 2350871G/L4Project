Make a potting mix that\u2019s 60% potting soil and 40% compost so your plant gets enough nutrients while it\u2019s growing. Combine the soil and compost thoroughly until it\u2019s thoroughly mixed together. Use store-bought potting soil rather than soil from your yard to ensure that it doesn\u2019t have any harmful bacteria. If you live in an area with climate zones 9-12 or the temperature doesn\u2019t fall below 32 \u00b0F (0 \u00b0C), you can put your curry leaf plant directly in the ground. Make sure to amend the soil so it has the proper nutrients. If you want to grow more than 1 curry leaf plant, then prepare multiple pots for each additional plant you want."
