Hanging String Lights above an Open Space Identify any existing supports you can use to hang your string lights. If you plan to hang your lights above your deck or patio, you should first check for sturdy places that already exist that you can use to mount them.

If you have a gap where this is no support or don\u2019t have any natural supports around at all, you will need to make your own supports for your hanging lights. You can use tape to mark where you will need to create a support. Get tall metal poles or wooden posts to use as supports for your lights.

Drive stakes into the ground and slide hollow metal poles onto them. This is an easy and inexpensive way to create very strong supports that you can attach your lights to.
