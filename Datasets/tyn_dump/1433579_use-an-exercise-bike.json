An upright bike more closely simulates riding a bicycle, while a recumbent bike lets you lean back and pedal with your legs in front of you. Measure the available space in your home.

If you don't, or if you will only use the bike as a backup workout, get a manual bike, which is smaller. Consider your budget. Electronic bikes cost more to maintain.

Ensure that the bike is the right size. Get on it in the shoes you will wear during the workouts and see if it can be adjusted so you can ride it comfortably. Adjusting the Bike Adjust the seat. When your pedal is at its lowest (or farthest forward for recumbent bikes) your knee should only bend slightly. You should not have to flex your foot or point your toes to stay in contact with the pedal. Change the handlebars so that you can grip them without leaning forward.
