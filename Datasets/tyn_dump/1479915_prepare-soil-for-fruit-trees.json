The water should drain within 3 to 4 hours, at which point you should fill the hole again with water. If the hole does not drain within 3 to 4 hours during the first and second water filling, your soil won't likely drain well enough to support a fruit tree. If your hole drains completely in less than 3 hours, the soil may be too sandy. To improve this, add organic matter to the soil. Soil that drains poorly can be improved with a drainage system, planting mounds, or raised beds."

Removing this layer isn't really a cost effective option, so a DIY French drain system may be the best solution for slow draining soil.

The tree's soil line should be 6 to 12 in (15.2 to 30.5 cm) higher than surrounding soil. For mounds that are 6 in (15.2 cm) high, you should also use a width of at least 2.5 ft (.76 m). For mounds that are 10 or 12 in (25.4 or 30.5 cm) high, use a width between 3 and 4 ft (.9 and 1.2 m). Avoid making steep slopes with your mounds. Gentle slopes will prevent the soil from eroding."
