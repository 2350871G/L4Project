Brush away any extra crumbs. If there's trash on the keyboard, brush it away. Check the keys again. See if they are working. Blowing Out the Keyboard Buy a can of compressed air. You can find it at almost any place that sells electronics. Turn the computer off. If you have a desktop, unplug the keyboard from the computer. Use the air to gently blow around and under the keys. Don't tilt the can, as it can pour out liquid. Brush away any debris. If dirt or food is blown out, brush it away from the keyboard. Try the keys again. See if the keys are unstuck. Cleaning Sticky Keys Wipe up any spills as they happen. If you spill a drink on your keyboard, unplug it and wipe it down. Clean the keys with alcohol if the drink dries. Make sure the keyboard is unplugged first, or your laptop is powered down. If the spill is mostly on top of the keys, use a cotton swab and rubbing alcohol to clean the keys. Rub the tops of the keys. Make sure they are free from stickiness. Use the cotton swab to go around the edges. Going around the edges should help with sticky keys, as it releases the bottom part of the key from the keyboard. Check to see if your keys are unstuck. Once the alcohol is dry, check your keys to see if they are better. Removing Keys to Clean the Keypad Gently pry up the jammed key.
