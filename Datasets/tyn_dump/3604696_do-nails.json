        "File the nail into a shape that works for you.",
        "Some options include:\nRound\nSquare\nRounded square (Square shaped with slightly rounded corners)\nOval\nSquoval (halfway between square and oval)\nBallerina (shaped like a ballet slipper)\nAlmond\nStiletto (pointed at the end)\nLipstick (flat, slanted tips that resemble the end of lipstick) Paint your dominant hand first to make the process easier.",
        "This helps prevent smudging and errors, as it\u2019ll be easier to paint your non-dominant hand rather than your dominant hand.",
        "Stretch your fingers out wide to prepare you for painting, and pay extra attention to your dominant hand when painting it using your non-dominant hand.",
        "Painting your pinkie first and then moving around your fingers to your thumb will help prevent smudging.",
        "Apply a base coat to protect your nails.",
        "Spread the base coat over each nail in an even layer\u2014since it\u2019s clear and won\u2019t be seen, it\u2019s okay if this coat isn\u2019t perfect.",
        "The base coat protects your nails from any damage the nail polish could cause while also helping the polish stick to your nails more easily.",
        "Let the base coat dry before applying polish.",
        "Brush the nail polish onto each nail using three strokes.",
        "Dip the nail polish brush into the polish, wiping off any excess on the edge of the bottle.",
        "Start applying the nail polish right below your cuticle, swiping down the left, right, and middle of the nail.",
        "Apply the nail polish so it covers your entire nail, being careful not to get it on your skin or covering your cuticles.",
        "Spread the nail polish in thin, even coats.",
        "Aim for thin layers as opposed to super thick ones, as thick ones will take much longer to dry.",
        "To ensure your coats are thin, wipe off the excess nail polish on the edge of the bottle each time you dip the brush into the nail polish.",
        "Apply a second layer of polish after letting the first coat dry.",
        "Wait a few minutes for the first layer to dry completely.",
        "Apply the second coat just as you did the first, spreading the nail polish on in a thin, even layer.",
        "Do a quick touch test to see if the first layer of nail polish is dry or not.",
        "If you can still see your nail color through the first layer or the nail polish coat isn\u2019t all the same shade, apply a second (and third, if necessary) coat.",
        "Clean up any smudges using a Q-tip dipped in acetone.",
        "Dip the Q-tip in the nail polish remover so that it\u2019s damp but not dripping.",
        "Use the Q-tip to go along the edge of your fingernail, gently removing any smudges or mistakes so that the nail polish is only on your nails.",
        "Acetone and nail polish remover are the same thing.",
        "Use a top coat to seal the polish and keep it from chipping.",
        "Apply the clear top coat in a thin, even layer to each nail once they\u2019re completely finished and dry.",
        "It\u2019s a good idea to brush the top coat onto the tip of your nail, which will prevent chipping even more.",
        "Note that if you apply the top coat to the nails before the layer of color beneath it finishes drying, it could create bubbles or ripples in the color.",
        "Applying Acrylic Nails Push back the cuticle on each fingernail.",
        "Do this with a damp cloth, your own fingers, or a cuticle pusher made of wood.",
        "Gently push back the skin around each nail so that your cuticles are no longer covering up the top of your nails.",
        "Wash your hands to make sure your nails are clean.",
        "Never cut or remove your cuticles, as this can lead to infection.",
        "Sand the top of each nail to remove the shine.",
        "Use a nail buffer to gently buff the top of your nail, creating a rough surface so the acrylic nails can attach more easily.",
        "Repeat this process on each nail until each nail no longer has a shine.",
        "Be careful not to file the surface too deeply, or you could damage your nails.",
        "Use a soft brush to remove the dust.",
        "Spritz some dehydrator spray onto your nails after you remove the dust.",
        "Match a nail tip to each of your nails so that the sides align well.",
        "Look through a package of acrylic nail sizes and start deciding which size will go on which nail.",
        "When choosing the right size, place the nail tip along the white part of your nail.",
        "Choose a nail tip that doesn\u2019t go over the side edges of your own nail and isn\u2019t too small.",
        "An ideal nail tip will line up perfectly with the edges of your nail.",
        "Use an acrylic nail cutter to shorten the nail, if desired.",
        "Purchase acrylic nails from a beauty supply store or online, buying a nail kit that comes with all the materials you'll need, or choosing to just purchase the fake nail tips that come in different sizes.",
        "While this method uses fake nail tips, you can opt for whole fake nails that cover your entire nail and are often clear or white.",
        "Use nail glue to attach each tip to your nails.",
        "Squeeze out the nail glue right along the edge of your nail in an even line.",
        "Place the nail tip on the glue, positioning it low on your nail but also high enough so that it\u2019s secure and won\u2019t break off.",
        "Hold the nail tip in place for at least 10 seconds, making sure it\u2019s laying flat on your nail and not angled downwards due to any pressure from your fingers.",
        "Find nail glue at a drugstore, big box store, beauty store, or online.",
        "Sand the nail tip to create a smooth surface.",
        "Once the acrylic nail tip is securely attached, use a nail filer to sand the glued-on edge.",
        "This will make it level with your real nail, creating a flat surface for the acrylic to adhere to.",
        "File the surface of the entire acrylic nail as well so that it\u2019s rough and shine-free like your real nail.",
        "Use the nail file to shape the edge of your acrylic nail, if desired.",
        "Brush away any dust left from filing before applying the primer and acrylic.",
        "Apply primer to your nails to get rid of any oils.",
        "Find a nail primer from a big box store, beauty store, or online that prepares your nails by cleaning them and helping the acrylic powder stick evenly.",
        "Apply the primer just as you would normal nail polish, covering each nail in a thin, even coat.",
        "Avoid skipping this step, as the acrylic powder won\u2019t adhere well to your nails without the primer.",
        "Dip a brush in monomer and scoop up a bead of acrylic powder.",
        "Use a small makeup brush, dipping it into the monomer and wiping off any excess monomer on the side of the bottle.",
        "Dip the brush into the powder, creating a dime-sized bead of acrylic on the tip.",
        "The monomer is a chemical that reacts with the powder to form the acrylic bead of paint.",
        "Get rid of any bubbles in the monomer on your brush to avoid having bubbles on your nails as well.",
        "Place the powder bead towards the top of your nail, brushing it downwards.",
        "Once the bead has turned glossy, start spreading it on the top of your nail.",
        "Gently dab it into place right beneath your cuticle, using the brush to drag the bead of powder down along your nail.",
        "As you drag and dab the bead, it will flatten out.",
        "Use the brush to manipulate the bead of powder until your entire nail is covered in an even layer.",
        "Avoid getting the bead of powder on your skin or cuticles.",
        "Let your nails dry completely before doing any extra filing or shaping.",
        "Let your nails dry for 15-30 minutes.",
        "Check to see if they\u2019re completely dry by tapping them\u2014if you hear a clicking sound, they\u2019re dry!",
        "Use a nail file to shape the nail exactly how you like it.",
        "Apply a top coat to protect your acrylic nails.",
        "Once you\u2019re satisfied with how your nails look, brush on a protective clear coat in an even, thin layer.",
        "Cover the entire nail and brush the clear coat along the tip of your nail to help prevent chipping."
