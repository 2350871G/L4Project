Heat the cream in a small saucepan until just hot to the touch, but not boiling.  With the mixer on, slowly add the hot cream to beaten egg mixture, being careful not to scramble the eggs.  Pour the mix into six 8-ounce ramekins. Place the ramekins in a pan with high sides. Pour hot water into the large pan, enough that it reaches about \u00bd way up the sides of the ramekins. This creates a steam bath so the Cr\u00e8me Brulee won\u2019t crack. Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the middle of the custards are just set.  Cool and refrigerate until chilled thoroughly before next steps.  If you own a blow-torch Cover the top the the custard with a thin layer of sugar. Depending on how thick you want the crust, you can use anywhere from one teaspoon to one tablespoon for a typical ramekin. Raw sugar (turbinado) works very well. However, some people use regular granulated sugar or even brown sugar. Place the ramekins on a fireproof surface.  Light the torch and leave it on its highest setting.  Hold the tip of the torch 2-3 inches (5-8 cm) from the sugar. Keep the flame moving around the sugar so it heats evenly. After a few dark brown spots form, remove the torch and let the sugar cool for about 10 seconds. Then apply the torch a second time to brown it more evenly. If you don\u2019t own a blow-torch Turn on the broiler.  Take 1 tablespoon of sugar and sprinkle it evenly over the top of a ramekin. Repeat this for all 6 ramekins. Make sure the broiler is heated thoroughly, and then put the ramekins with the layered sugar into the oven for approximately 2 to 3 minutes.  As soon as you notice a light brown color, take the Cr\u00e8me Brulees out of the oven and serve immediately.  Another Method If you don\u2019t have a broiler (or if it hasn't been cleaned in quite a while) grab a fireplace match. These matches are normally 8 inches long.
