        "Now scoop out the avocado flesh from the skin and drop into a small bowl.",
        "Mash it up with a fork so it becomes smooth and like a paste.",
        "You can add a few drops of water to help the process along.",
        "You can also add a few drops of lemon juice to add extra kick to your avocado mask.",
        "Remember if you have dry or sensitive skin lemon juice could make it worse.",
        "Apply it to your face.",
        "Once you have prepared your avocado, clean your face and hands before applying the paste to your skin.",

        "Using Egg White Mix an egg white mask.",
        "Egg whites are rich in collagen and protein, and can help to tighten your pores, which has purifying effects.",
        "This option is more advisable for those with oily rather than dry skin.",
        "If you have dry skin it could cause irritation and excessive dryness.",
        "Similarly if you have sensitive skin the vitamin A could cause breakouts, and it best to speak to your dermatologist first.",
        "To make the mask just whip up some eggs whites in a bowl.",
        "You want a good frothy consistency.",
        "Apply the mask.",
        "Once you have got the egg whites prepared, and cleaned your face and hands, simply apply the mask to your face with your finger tips.",
        "Gently massage it into your face, taking care to avoid any areas that are particularly sensitive, such as the area around the eyes.",
        "Wait before washing it off.",
        "Allow the egg white mask to dry on you face.",
        "When you feel it has dried you will most likely feel your skin tightening.",
        "Now gently rinse it off with warm water.",
        "Be sure to clean off any residue and then apply a moisturiser.",
        "Egg white will dry out your skin, so moisturising after you use it will help re-hydrate your skin."
