Bending Glass Stringers for Art Projects Put on safety glasses. Glass stringers are thin, specially prepared rods designed for use in craft projects. While they are easy to work with, their use still involves extreme temperatures and brittle glass. Always wear eye protection, and never touch the glass at the heated point. You will also need a safe place to put the hot glass down, such as a brick. Tweezers are also useful for some of the steps below. Light a candle. Unlike thicker rods, stringers can be bent using an ordinary candle flame. A Bunsen burner or stationary torch will work as well, but these are not necessary. Make a simple bend by hand.
