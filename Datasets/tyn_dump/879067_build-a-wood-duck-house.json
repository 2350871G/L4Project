Ducks Unlimited advises that a wood duck nesting box is best placed on a wooden post or a metal pole designed with predator guards. Boxes placed on posts in water should be about 5 feet (1.52 meters) above the water's surface. Boxes may be placed in woodlands areas up to one-half mile from water in trees or on a post at least 8 feet (2.4 meters) high, but preferably 20 feet (6.09 meters) high. To reduce the chances of predation, they should be 30 to 100 feet (9.14 meters to 30.48 meters) from the water's edge. Keep in mind to place the box:\nNear suitable brood habitat;\nNear shallow, fertile wetlands with thick cover; and\nWhere there is a plentiful supply of invertebrates for eating. Don't forget to add a 4\" (10.16 cm) layer of wood shavings for the nesting material. Suitable shavings include \"chain saw\" wood chips (or cedar wood chip bedding such as found in pet stores)."
