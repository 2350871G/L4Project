Luckily, you can raise dorm beds the same way you raise a normal bed, with risers. Risers help if you only want to raise your bed a little bit, but you won\u2019t be able to loft your bed.

Make sure that all four risers are the same height, so that your bed is level. If your bed is too heavy to lift, take off your mattress and put it someplace out of the way. Replace it once you're done. Store more things under your bed once it\u2019s raised. Having some extra room under your bed is very helpful in the tight space of a dorm room.

        "You and your roommate can decide who wants which bed.",
        "You can climb up to the top bunk using the side slats on your bed, or ask for a ladder from the housing office.",
        "Raising Your Bed with Risers Get risers if your dorm bed isn\u2019t made to be lofted.",
        "While most dorm beds are easy to loft, some beds aren\u2019t.",
        "Luckily, you can raise dorm beds the same way you raise a normal bed, with risers.",
        "Risers help if you only want to raise your bed a little bit, but you won\u2019t be able to loft your bed.",
        "Buy risers in the height you want.",
        "Risers usually come in 3 or 5 inches (7.6 or 12.7 cm).",
        "If you want to raise your bed higher, get stackable bed risers, so that you can stack the 3 and 5 inches (7.6 and 12.7 cm) for 8 inches (20 cm).",
        "When deciding what height you want to raise your bed to, balance the benefit of extra storage space with the extra difficulty of climbing onto a high bed.",
        "You can buy bed risers at a home supply store or online.",
        "Lift up one corner of the bed at a time while your friend slides a riser underneath.",
        "Continue until all four risers are underneath the bed.",
        "Make sure that all four risers are the same height, so that your bed is level.",
        "If your bed is too heavy to lift, take off your mattress and put it someplace out of the way.",
        "Replace it once you're done.",
        "Store more things under your bed once it\u2019s raised.",
        "Having some extra room under your bed is very helpful in the tight space of a dorm room.",
        "Make full use of the extra space by storing dresser drawers, suitcases, a laundry basket, shoes, or whatever else you want.",
        "Stacking items underneath your bed or keeping them organized in bins will help you save space."
