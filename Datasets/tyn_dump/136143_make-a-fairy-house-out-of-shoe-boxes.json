It would be best if the shoe box comes with a lid, but if it doesn't, that's okay. You will just need to use extra cardboard to make the roof and floors. Some shoe boxes have lids that are attached along 1 edge, like a flap. If this is the case for your box, cut the lid off first. Some craft and fabric stores sell \"photo boxes\" that are shaped like shoe boxes. These work great for fairy houses! Measure the length, width, and depth of your box. You will need these measurements to create the roof, floor, and walls. Use a ruler to measure in the following areas, then write those measurements down:\nLength: the longest edge of the box. Width: the shortest edge of the box. Depth: the height of the box; it goes from the opening to the base. Cut the lid lengthwise to make a strip that matches the box's depth. Take the lid off, then cut it in half lengthwise according to your box's depth measurement. You can cut the lid with scissors, but a craft blade will also work. For example, if your box is 4 inches (10 cm) deep, cut the lid so that it is 4 inches (10 cm) wide. Cut the lid's long wall off, but leave the side walls on. A shoe box lid is three-dimensional, just like the box itself; it has 2 short walls and 2 long walls. The strip that you cut should have 1 long wall and 2 short walls. Cut off the wall along the longest edge, but leave the 2 short walls on the sides. The 2 short walls will make little tabs that you can use to secure your roof to the top of the box. Fold the strip in half widthwise to make a V-shape. It does not matter which side of the lid (inside or outside) is facing out. Make sure that you are folding the roof so that the narrow edges match up. Once you have folded and creased the strip, unfold it so that it forms a V-shape. This is now your roof. Tape the roof to 1 of the narrow ends of the box. Stand the shoebox on 1 of its narrow ends. Stand the roof up on top of the box, then tape the side tabs to the sides of the box. You can glue the roof on if you prefer. Hot glue will work the best because it sets up fast. You can use tacky glue, but you'll have to tape the tabs down until the glue dries. Use extra cardboard to create a back wall for the roof, if desired. Set the house down on a sheet of cardboard so that the opening of the shoe box is facing up. Trace around the roof, then cut the triangle shape out of the cardboard. Tape or glue the triangle to the back of the roof. The back of the roof is on the same side as the base of the shoe box. The front of the roof is on the same side as the opening. Adding Rooms, Windows, and Doors Cut the rest of the lid apart to make the second floor. Stand the house up on what's left of the lid. Trace around the bottom of the house with a pen, pencil, or marker, then lift the house away. Cut the resulting rectangle out with scissors or a craft blade. Try to include at least 2 of the walls from the lid. These will create tabs that will make it easier to install the floor. If the leftover lid is not big enough, use another sheet of cardboard. Cereal boxes work great for this. Tape or glue the dividing floor into the middle of the shoe box. Insert the rectangle floor into the shoe box. Make sure that the top and bottom floors are about the same height, then tape or glue the 2 tabs from the dividing floor to the box.

Cut the rectangle out, then add a strip of tape to the top, bottom, and side edges. Slide the room divider into the room, then press the tape strips against the floor, ceiling, and back wall. The height of the rectangle should match the height of the room. The width of the rectangle should match the depth of the box. Don't do more than 1 room divider per floor, otherwise the rooms will be too narrow. Draw window and door shapes, as desired. It would be best to draw these on the inside of the box, because then you can be sure that the floor and room dividers won't get in the way. If this is too hard for you, just flip the box over, and draw your windows and doors on the back. Use something that is easily visible, like a pen or marker. For a fancier house, give the windows a + shaped grid! Cut the doors and windows out with a craft blade. You can work right on top of a cutting mat. Alternatively, you can poke holes in each of the corners of the windows and doors, flip the box over, then connect the holes. If you are a child, get an adult to help you with this.

Give them a quick coat of paint, or cover them with scrapbooking paper. Once the paint or glue dries, hot glue a bead to 1 side to make the door knob. Furnishing the House Create ladders with craft sticks or twigs. Cut 2 sticks that are a little taller than your first floor, and a bunch of smaller sticks that are about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. Set the 2 long sticks down side by side, then glue the smaller sticks across them to make a ladder. Hot glue will work the best for this, but you can use tacky glue or liquid school glue.

        "Use a ruler to measure in the following areas, then write those measurements down:\nLength: the longest edge of the box.",
        "Width: the shortest edge of the box.",
        "Depth: the height of the box; it goes from the opening to the base.",
        "Cut the lid lengthwise to make a strip that matches the box's depth.",
        "Take the lid off, then cut it in half lengthwise according to your box's depth measurement.",
        "You can cut the lid with scissors, but a craft blade will also work.",
        "For example, if your box is 4 inches (10 cm) deep, cut the lid so that it is 4 inches (10 cm) wide.",
        "Cut the lid's long wall off, but leave the side walls on.",
        "A shoe box lid is three-dimensional, just like the box itself; it has 2 short walls and 2 long walls.",
        "The strip that you cut should have 1 long wall and 2 short walls.",
        "Cut off the wall along the longest edge, but leave the 2 short walls on the sides.",
        "The 2 short walls will make little tabs that you can use to secure your roof to the top of the box.",
        "Fold the strip in half widthwise to make a V-shape.",
        "It does not matter which side of the lid (inside or outside) is facing out.",
        "Make sure that you are folding the roof so that the narrow edges match up.",
        "Once you have folded and creased the strip, unfold it so that it forms a V-shape.",

        "Tape the roof to 1 of the narrow ends of the box.",
        "Stand the shoebox on 1 of its narrow ends.",
        "Stand the roof up on top of the box, then tape the side tabs to the sides of the box.",
        "You can glue the roof on if you prefer.",
        "Hot glue will work the best because it sets up fast.",
        "You can use tacky glue, but you'll have to tape the tabs down until the glue dries.",
        "Use extra cardboard to create a back wall for the roof, if desired.",
        "Set the house down on a sheet of cardboard so that the opening of the shoe box is facing up.",
        "Trace around the roof, then cut the triangle shape out of the cardboard.",
        "Tape or glue the triangle to the back of the roof.",
        "The back of the roof is on the same side as the base of the shoe box.",
        "The front of the roof is on the same side as the opening.",

        "Stand the house up on what's left of the lid.",
        "Trace around the bottom of the house with a pen, pencil, or marker, then lift the house away.",
        "Cut the resulting rectangle out with scissors or a craft blade.",
        "Try to include at least 2 of the walls from the lid.",
        "These will create tabs that will make it easier to install the floor.",
        "If the leftover lid is not big enough, use another sheet of cardboard.",
        "Cereal boxes work great for this.",
        "Tape or glue the dividing floor into the middle of the shoe box.",
        "Insert the rectangle floor into the shoe box.",
        "Make sure that the top and bottom floors are about the same height, then tape or glue the 2 tabs from the dividing floor to the box.",
        "Use a strip of tape to secure the other end of the floor to the box.",
        "If you did not leave any tabs, place strips of tape along 2 of the narrow edges and 1 of the long edges, then slide the floor into the box.",
        "Press the tape strips against the walls.",
        "Use extra cardboard to make extra walls, if desired.",
        "Draw a rectangle on a sheet of cardboard based on the height and depth of the room.",
        "Cut the rectangle out, then add a strip of tape to the top, bottom, and side edges.",
        "Slide the room divider into the room, then press the tape strips against the floor, ceiling, and back wall.",
        "The height of the rectangle should match the height of the room.",
        "The width of the rectangle should match the depth of the box.",
        "Don't do more than 1 room divider per floor, otherwise the rooms will be too narrow.",
        "Draw window and door shapes, as desired.",
        "It would be best to draw these on the inside of the box, because then you can be sure that the floor and room dividers won't get in the way.",
        "If this is too hard for you, just flip the box over, and draw your windows and doors on the back.",
        "Use something that is easily visible, like a pen or marker.",
        "For a fancier house, give the windows a + shaped grid!",
        "Cut the doors and windows out with a craft blade.",
        "You can work right on top of a cutting mat.",
        "Alternatively, you can poke holes in each of the corners of the windows and doors, flip the box over, then connect the holes.",
        "If you are a child, get an adult to help you with this.",
        "Don't cut the doors along 1 of the long, vertical edges.",
        "This way, you can still open and close the doors!",
        "Don't worry if you accidentally cut through the grid on the window frame.",
        "You can fix it later with sticks.",
        "Decorating the House Cover the outside of the house with paper, if desired.",
        "Scrapbooking paper works great here, but you can also use wrapping paper, tissue paper, or even construction paper.",

        "If you bought a photo box from the craft or fabric store, it may already have a pattern on the outside.",
        "If you like the pattern, then you don't have to do this step.",
        "If you don't have a glue stick, use a paintbrush to apply a thin layer of liquid glue to the box.",
        "Paint the outside of your fairy house if you don't want to use paper.",
        "Acrylic craft paint will work the best, but you can use tempera or poster paint too.",

        "You can use white school glue as well.",
        "Apply it to the walls with a paintbrush, then press the paper down.",

        "Be sure to trim both of these off!",
        "You can also use wooden coffee stirrers.",
        "Another option is to use scrapbooking paper that looks like wood.",
        "Add some shingles or sticks to the roof for a realistic effect.",
        "Gather enough sticks, moss, or pinecone petals to cover your roof, then glue them down with hot glue.",
