Try to make a \"+\" sign using the center and edges of the face, which may be scattered around the cube. If one of the edges is incorrectly oriented, face that side towards you and apply FU'RU. Rotate the cube so that the plus sign is now the left face. You will put the UF edge in place first. If that edge is in the right face, turn the right face to put that edge in FR position.
