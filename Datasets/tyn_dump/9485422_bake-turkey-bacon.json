Baking Brown Sugar Turkey Bacon in the Oven Preheat the oven to 375 \u00b0F (191 \u00b0C) and prepare a baking sheet. Tear off a sheet of parchment paper and lay it on a rimmed baking sheet. Lay the turkey bacon on the parchment-lined baking sheet. Ensure that the turkey bacon is in a single layer so it cooks evenly. The slices can be touching, but not overlapping or they won't become crispy. To serve about 4 people, use 1 pound (453 g) of turkey bacon (about 20 to 30 slices depending on thickness). Combine the brown sugar and maple syrup. Measure \u00bc cup (50 g) of packed light brown sugar into a small bowl along with 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of pure maple syrup. Use a whisk or a spoon to dissolve the brown sugar in the maple syrup. Brush the brown sugar syrup over the turkey bacon.

Season the turkey bacon and bake it for 20 to 25 minutes. Sprinkle some freshly ground black pepper evenly over the turkey bacon.

Cool leftover turkey bacon and refrigerate it in an airtight container for 4 to 5 days. Keep in mind that the turkey bacon will probably lose some of its crispiness. Baking Turkey Bacon in the Microwave Line a plate with a paper towel. Get out a microwave-safe plate that's large enough to hold several pieces of turkey bacon. Lay a paper towel on the plate. Arrange the turkey bacon on the paper towel. Lay 4 slices of turkey bacon on the paper towel-lined plate so they're in a single layer. If you want to cook more than 4 slices, you'll need to microwave them in batches. Microwave the turkey bacon for 2 minutes. Place the plate in the microwave and ensure that your microwave is set to 100% power. Microwave the turkey bacon in 30 second increments until it's hot and crisp. Remove and serve the turkey bacon.
