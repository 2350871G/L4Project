If you choose to sew the straps, be sure to use a thick, waxed thread, and a leather needle. If you choose to glue the straps, you will need to secure them with clips until the glue dries. If you choose to hammer in nail studs, consider getting ones made specifically for leather work; the ones made for fabric may not be tough enough. Add the nose strap if needed. Cut a thin piece of leather or find an old watch band; you can also cut a thin scrap from canvas fabric. Slide both ends of the strap through the slots on the front of the goggles.
