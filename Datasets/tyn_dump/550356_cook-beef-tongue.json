                    "description": "Larger tongues can take much longer to cook, so choose the smallest tongue you can find, ideally below 3 pounds / 1.4 kg. Tongue has a short shelf life, so purchase it very fresh or frozen from a reliable butcher. (If frozen, thaw in the refrigerator for maximum safety.) Some tongues include the glands, bones, and fat at the root of the tongue. This area is edible when cooked, but not everyone likes the soft, fatty texture. You may cut it off at home (before or after cooking), or look for a pre-trimmed \"Swiss cut\" tongue. Brined tongue packs extra flavor and can be prepared the same way as fresh tongue."
