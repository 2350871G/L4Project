Do this by parting your hair straight down the middle of your head from front to back, and then again across your head from one ear to the other. Twist the top 2 sections up completely, and secure them with plastic clips. Part the back 2 sections down the middle. If you\u2019re having trouble parting or sectioning your hair in the back, stand in front of a large mirror. Hold a smaller mirror in front of you above your head with one hand, and use your comb with the other.

A lightener is necessary to lift your hair to a pale shade of blonde. Use a 20 volume developer. Don\u2019t use 30 or 40 volume developers at home. Bleach powder and volume developer typically come together in kits. If your hair is thick or longer than your shoulders, you\u2019ll need 2 kits. Bleach kits usually come with 35 or 40 volume developer so be very careful when buying bleaching kits and using higher volume developer as it is much more damaging to your hair! If you\u2019ve never lightened your hair with bleach before, it\u2019s best to go to a professional to get it done. Bleaching can damage your hair and/or scalp, and should be used very carefully."

Paint lightening mixture onto the hair with a brush, starting from the middle of each section and going to the ends. Leave the roots until you have covered the mid-strands to ends. Make sure to thoroughly saturate the hair with the brush, using multiple strokes in various directions as needed. Roll each section up into the sheet of foil after you paint it. Once finished, leave the mixture in your hair for up to 45 minutes, until your hair reaches a yellow stage. You may want to keep your darker roots and apply the opal effect to only the ends of your hair. If so, leave a few inches or centimeters of hair close to your scalp (or however much you prefer) untouched with each section you paint. Make sure to wear gloves and follow all safety precautions that came with your lightening kit. Check your hair with gloved hands every 5 to 10 minutes. Never leave bleach on your hair for longer than 45 minutes. Fine hair lightens more easily than coarse hair. Thus fine hair will process faster than coarse hair."
