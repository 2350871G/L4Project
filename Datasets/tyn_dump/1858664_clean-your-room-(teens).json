Avoid wearing any tight clothes that prevent you from bending or kneeling to reach something you need to pick up. For example, you may wear a loose-fitting T-shirt or a large sweatshirt as a top, and choose sweatpants or athletic shorts as bottoms. Avoid wearing your street shoes in your room since you could track in more dirt."
