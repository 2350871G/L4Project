Slide your kayak into the water with the bow (The front) first, place your hand firmly on the stern (The back) grab loop and position the kayak so that the cockpit area is in shallow enough water to stand in.

Bring your other leg into the kayak. Slide down into the kayak. Make sure your balance is good and you have both of your feet firmly planted on the floor of your kayak and your hands gripping the paddle, now slide into your kayak. Holding your kayak paddle Know the structure of the kayak paddle. Unlike a canoe paddle, a kayak paddle has 2 blades attached to the shaft of the paddle. The shaft is the part of the paddle that you hold and the blades are the part that you use to pull yourself and the kayak through the water. Have your paddle face the right direction.

If you are right handed, your control grip will be with your right hand and if you are left handed your control grip will be with your left hand. When taking a kayaking stroke, allow the paddle to rotate and reposition in your \"loose hand\" to make sure that each paddle always enters the water smoothly. The control grip does not change positions once it is on the paddle. Grasp your paddle and hold it. Grab your paddle and make sure to place the control grip on the paddle first. Have your hands centered on the paddle. Your hands should be just a little more than shoulder width apart. Taking a forward stroke Hold your paddle properly.  Make sure to have proper posture in the kayak. Sit upright with your legs securely in the thigh braces and the balls of your feet against the foot supports. Rotate your body. Rotate your body while extending and retracting your arms. For example; If you want to take a stroke on the right side, rotate your torso counter-clockwise while extending your right arm and retracting your left arm. Take the stroke. Place the right side of your paddle blade in the water near the feet and rotate the torso as you're pulling the blade through the water alongside of the boat, retract your right arm while at the same time extending your left arm. Setup for the next stroke and rotate your grip. As soon as you've finished the stroke on the right side of the kayak, your paddle should be setup for the next stroke on the left side of the boat.

Allow the paddle to rotate in your other hand (The loose hand) until the paddle blade is lined up to enter the water at the proper angle and grasp the paddle with your \"loose hand.\" Take the next stroke. Once you've rotated your grip, place the left paddle blade in the water near the feet and rotate the torso while pulling the blade through the water along the left side of the boat while retracting your left arm and extending your right arm. Getting out of the kayak Secure the kayak with a tie line. This isn't a mandatory step, but if you are getting off on a dock, it's extremely recommended. Use the paddle to steady the kayak. Since the kayak is in water, one off balance moment can send you swimming. Crouch. This gets you ready to follow the next steps.
