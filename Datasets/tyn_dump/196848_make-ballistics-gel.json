Preparing the Mold Obtain a large plastic storage container. Find a container that is 12 (h) x 12 (w) x 20 (l) inches in size. Avoid containers with patterns on the sides or bottom, as it will make removing the gel more difficult. Measure and mark the mold. Measure the inside wall 6 inches (15.2 cm) from the bottom of the container and mark it with a permanent marker. This will be the line that you fill the water to. Spray the container with non-stick cooking spray. Coat the entire inside with spray to help release the gel when it is finished. Wipe any excess spray out to avoid cloudiness in the finished gel. Making the Gel Fill the container with warm water. Fill the mold to the line drawn earlier using warm tap water. Ideally, the temperature should be around 105 \u00b0F (41 \u00b0C).
