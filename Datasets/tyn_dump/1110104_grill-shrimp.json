Smaller shrimp are also more likely to overcook on the grill, which could lead to a rubbery or tough texture. Buy U/10 or U/20 shrimp. This means that there is either 10 or 20 shrimp per pound. Cook fresh shrimp the same day that you purchase them or freeze them If you plan on making them later. When you bring fresh shrimp home, keep them on a bed of ice so that they don\u2019t go bad."

Start at the top of the shrimp and cut through shrimp\u2019s shell with a pair of scissors. You can cut all the way down the tail, or stop before the tail to keep it on. Peel away the excess shell and throw it away. If you keep the tail on, it can serve as your handle for dipping and eating the grilled seafood. Don\u2019t cut through the meat of the shrimp.
