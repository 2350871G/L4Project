Open the lid on the top of this tank and fill it at least halfway with water.Tip: If there\u2019s already water in the tank, you don\u2019t need to fill it. However, you should replace the water if it has been sitting for more than 1-2 days. To do this, simply twist and lift the water tank out of the slot and pour the water out before refilling it. Then, slide the tank in and twist it until you hear a click. You can use standard tap water, bottled water, or purified water.

If it isn\u2019t full, you don\u2019t need to empty it. Slide the panel back into the machine. The size of the receptacle is different depending on the model. The Nespresso pods are pretty small, so most machines can hold at least 10-15 pods. Empty the machine out every week to ensure that the receptacle doesn\u2019t fill up and jam. When your machine is done brewing a cup of coffee or espresso, the pod automatically drops into the receptacle the next time you open the machine. If you can\u2019t open the machine to put a pod in, it\u2019s probably because the receptacle is full. If it\u2019s jammed, you may need to use a bit of force to pull the receptacle out.
