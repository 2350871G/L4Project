If you know other people who play instruments not on the list, (saxophone, violin, etc), make them a back-up singer and add their instrument in some of the songs. Try having at least one acoustic and one electric guitar. Decide if the singer will play an instrument or not. Your band should be mostly comprised of friends and family. If you can't find someone, hold auditions for people at your school. Make sure everyone gets along together. If they don't the band could be a disaster. Remember, the best bands have the best people, not the best skills. If you get along and have fun, you'll sound better than a bunch of snobby professionals who constantly fight."
