Position the ruler where you want your line to be, then run the pencil along the ruler to mark it on the wall. Repeat this process, marking 12 inches (30 cm) at a time, until you\u2019ve marked off the entire length of the line you want to paint along. Use a bubble level as you go to make sure the lines you\u2019re drawing are perfectly straight. Place the level along the line; if the bubble goes to the center of the level, between the 2 black lines, your line is straight. If you\u2019re trying to paint along the line where your walls and ceiling meet, you can skip this step."

        "This will help you control the amount of paint you want to apply with the edger and keep you from accidentally putting too much on it.",
        "Use a regular paint brush to apply the paint to the edger.",
        "This is especially important if your edger has wheels on it, since dipping the edger into your paint will almost definitely get paint on these wheels.",
        "Run the edger along the edge of the line.",
        "If the edger has wheels, place the wheels right against the surface of the ceiling or the wall to make the line as straight as possible.",
        "If it doesn\u2019t have wheels, run the edger as slowly and smoothly as possible to ensure your line is straight.",
        "It\u2019s ok if some of the paint goes over the line, as long as you haven\u2019t painted the opposite side of the line yet.",
        "It\u2019s also fine if you\u2019re not able to get all the way up to the ceiling because of the edger\u2019s wheels; you can touch up these spots with a small brush later.",
        "Touch up any unpainted spots, as needed.",
        "Use a small brush to finish applying paint in any spots along the line that the edger wasn\u2019t able to get.",
        "For best results, use an angled brush with short, small bristles.",
        "Use a wet cloth to wipe off any paint that went over the line, if needed.",
        "This is important if you were painting a line against something that you didn\u2019t want to paint, such as a window sill.",
        "You can also use disinfectant wipes to clean up any accidental drips or smudges."
