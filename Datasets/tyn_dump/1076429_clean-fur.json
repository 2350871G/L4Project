Fur brushes have wider spaced teeth and soft edges, which prevent the brush from damaging the skin of the fur. If you do not have a proper fur brush, you can run your fingers through the fur to help clear-out any dirt or debris. Never brush your fur with a \"normal\" brush. This will damage the coat as the teeth on a normal brush are too fine. Avoid making long strokes along the length of the coat. This can cause the coat to stretch."
