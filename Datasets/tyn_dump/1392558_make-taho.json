Keep checking on the sago pearls until they are translucent with a solid-looking center. When finished, the pearls should be soft but still fairly chewy. Small sago pearls take about 20-30 minutes to make, while larger varieties can take up to an hour and a half. If you are cooking larger sago pearls, simmer them for 30 minutes with the lid on and then turn off the heat. Keep the lid on and let the pearls sit and cook for another hour. If the large pearls still aren't fully cooked, turn up the heat and keep cooking and testing the pearls until they are done. You can also pre-prepare the sago pearls if you wish. After cooking and draining the pearls, put them in a bowl, pour in enough water to cover them, and refrigerate them for up to three days. Don't over-cook the sago, as this changes the texture and makes them mushy."
