The third type is Sevruga, which is the most inexpensive, and it has small, crunchy eggs and a very full flavor. Standard caviar is from sturgeon fish in the Caspian sea. Other types of fish eggs are also sold as caviar, such as bowfin, paddlefish, and salmon; however, these varieties will be labelled as so. American bowfin caviar is a relatively inexpensive and popular type which has a tangy flavor. Salmon caviar are large, orange- or peach-colored eggs. This type is commonly found in Canada, the United States, and Russia."

                    "description": "The amount of caviar that you choose to buy depends on how many guests you will be serving, your budget, and how you are planning to serve the caviar. As a general guideline, when serving caviar alone, \u00bd - 1 oz (14.2 - 28.4 g) per person is standard. If you are serving caviar along with other foods, you won't need as much per person. Caviar is often sold in 2 oz (56.8 g) tins, which serves 2-4 people if the caviar is being served alone. You can purchase caviar from some grocery stores, markets, online, or directly from a caviar farm. The cost of caviar varies largely, and it depends on the species of fish and where you purchase it from.
