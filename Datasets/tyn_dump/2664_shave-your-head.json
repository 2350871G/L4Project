        "Stop shaving when you reach the back of your crown.",
        "Shave from bottom to top when finishing up the back.",
        "Place your clippers at the nape of your neck.",
        "Next, slowly bring the razor up toward your crown.",
        "Continue working your way across the back of your hair until you\u2019ve shaved your entire head.",
        "Shaving with a Razor Buzz your hair with a pair of clippers first, for best results.",
        "Remove the guard or use the 1 guard so your hair is cut very close to your scalp.",
        "This will reduce the resistance on your blade and help you get the closest shave possible.",
        "As an alternative, go to a barber or stylist to get your hair buzzed short.",
        "You can skip this step if your hair is already less than about .25 inches (0.64 cm) short.",
        "You may want to put down some newspapers to collect the hair as you trim it, especially if your hair is very long.",
        "Shave your head after a warm or hot shower so your hair will be softer.",
        "Warm or hot water opens your pores and softens your hair.",
        "This allows the razor to more easily slide over your head, so you end up with less irritation after your shave.",
        "Don't worry about drying your hair after the shower, as wet hair is easier to shave.",
        "However, it's okay to pat your head to remove excess water if it's dripping down your face or otherwise bothering you.",
        "As an alternative, run warm water over your head for a few minutes before you shave.",
        "Use a new blade every time you shave your head to minimize irritation.",
        "A dull blade will cause more friction, which may leave your scalp red and itchy.",
        "Additionally, it can lead to clogged pores or ingrown hairs.",
        "You can reuse your blade to shave other areas if you don\u2019t want to throw it away.",
        "It\u2019s best to choose a razor with 3-5 blades, which will provide a better shave in a single pass.",
        "You don\u2019t want to run the razor over your head more than once, as this will cause irritation and possibly redness.",
        "Apply shaving cream to your head so the blade slides over it easily.",
        "Work the cream into a lather, then slather it onto your head.",
        "Shaving cream helps you avoid a razor burn.",
        "Plus, it makes it easier to see where you\u2019ve already shaved.",
        "If you have very sensitive skin, you can also apply a shaving oil to your scalp before you apply the shaving cream.",
        "The oil provides an extra barrier to protect your scalp.",
        "Additionally, it allows the razor to more easily slide over your skin.",
        "Slide your razor in the direction of the grain of your hair.",
        "Make firm, steady strokes from front to back.",
        "Do your best to make just one pass over each section of your scalp, as multiple passes will cause skin irritation.",
        "Going with the grain will reduce irritation and lower your risk of ingrown hairs.",
        "Start with the top of your head.",
        "The hair on the top of your head is usually thinner, so it's easier to shave.",
        "Place your razor at the back of your crown, then pull it forward toward your forehead.",
        "Continue making even strokes until the top of your head is clean-shaven.",
        "In addition to your hair being thinner on top, you also can see the top of your head more easily than you can see the back.",
        "It's best to work from the easiest section to the hardest section because you'll develop a rhythm as you shave.",
        "Use a handheld mirror to check your work, as necessary.",
        "Do the sides of your head next.",
        "Place your blade just above the side patch of hair.",
        "Then, pull your razor down in an even stroke, stopping once you reach the top of your sideburns.",
        "Once you finish the first side, switch to the other side and repeat.",
        "The hair on the sides of your head is thicker than the hair on the top, but it's also still visible when you look in the mirror.",
        "Check your work in your handheld mirror as necessary.",
        "Shave the back of your head last, as it's the hardest.",
        "Position your blade at the back of your crown, then pull it down toward the nape of your neck.",
        "Make slow, even passes with your blade until your head is completely shaved.",
        "Take your time, as you likely won't be able to see what you're doing.",
        "Use your small handheld mirror to check your progress.",
        "It's helpful to take a look after each pass with your razor, but this isn't necessary.",
        "Rinse your blade in hot water after each pass with your razor.",
        "This keeps your blade clean and free of hair buildup.",
        "A clean blade will cause less irritation and is less likely to clog your pores.",
        "While it\u2019s best to rinse your blade in running water, it\u2019s also okay to rinse it in a clean cup of hot water.",
        "Pull your skin taut to minimize wrinkles and grooves.",
        "Use your free hand to lightly pull down on your skin near where you're shaving.",
        "This will make your skin temporarily smooth.",
        "Since a razor provides a closer shave, it\u2019s best if your scalp is as smooth as possible.",
        "Otherwise, you\u2019re more likely to nick or cut your skin.",
        "Finishing Your Shave Rinse your scalp with cold water after you shave to close your pores.",
        "Step into the shower for a quick rinse.",
        "Not only will this seal off your pores, it will also rinse off any little hairs that stuck to your skin as you were shaving.",
        "You don\u2019t need to shampoo your head, but you can use a mild shampoo or soap if you would like.",
        "Apply aftershave to your freshly shaved scalp to reduce irritation.",
        "Opt for an aftershave lotion or balm if one is available.",
        "These formulas are better for the sensitive skin on your scalp than splashes.",
        "However, an aftershave splash is better than going without it.",
        "If you\u2019re going to be shaving your head often, it\u2019s a good idea to invest in an aftershave that\u2019s formulated for your scalp.",
        "You can find these products near the shaving supplies at your local department store or online.",
        "Use a styptic pen or alum block to treat any nicks or cuts.",
        "Look over your head to check for spots that may be bleeding.",
        "Apply the styptic pen or alum block to the nick or cut.",
        "This will stop the bleeding and disinfect the wound.",
        "You can find a styptic pen or alum block at your local drugstore or online.",
        "Maintaining Your Shaved Look Wash your head daily with a gentle soap or shampoo.",
        "Put a pea-size amount of cleanser in your hands and work it into a lather.",
        "Then, rub the lather into your scalp to clean away the sweat and grime that naturally build up over the course of the day.",
        "Rinse with warm water.",
        "Dandruff shampoo can help with dry scalp, if that\u2019s a problem for you.",
        "Avoid using harsh cleansers on your scalp, as it\u2019s more sensitive than the rest of your skin.",
        "It\u2019s best to limit your showers to once a day so you don\u2019t dry out your scalp.",
        "Apply a moisturizer to your head at least twice a day.",
        "You can use face or body moisturizer, but it\u2019s best to use one formulated to protect your scalp.",
        "Slather it on in the morning and evening, especially if you\u2019ve just taken a shower.",
        "Moisturizer helps prevent dry patches and wrinkles.",
        "Additionally, it helps your scalp look freshly shaved for a longer period of time.",
        "If you\u2019re worried about shine, look for a moisturizer labeled as matte.",
        "Protect your head from the sun using sunscreen or a hat.",
        "Choose an SPF broad-spectrum sunscreen, and apply it at least 15 minutes before you leave home.",
        "Additionally, re-apply your sunscreen every 2-4 hours while you\u2019re outdoors.",
        "As an alternative, you can wear a hat for sun protection.",
        "Your shaved head will be very vulnerable to sunburn, which can cause skin damage, pain, and skin cancer.",
        "Follow the recommendations on your particular sunscreen when deciding how often to re-apply it.",
        "Put antiperspirant on your scalp before bed if excessive sweating is an issue.",
        "Normally, your hair collects the sweat beads that form on your head from natural perspiration.",
        "Unfortunately, sweat has nowhere to go but down if there\u2019s no hair there to catch it.",
        "Luckily, antiperspirant offers relief if your sweat is bothering you.",
        "Simply apply it to your scalp before bed to allow it time to soak into your skin.",
        "Spray on antiperspirant is the best option for your scalp, but you can use a stick or roll on if that\u2019s all you have.",
        "It\u2019s okay if you shower in the morning.",
        "The antiperspirant will still help control sweat because it\u2019s already soaked into your pores.",
        "Shave when re-growth becomes noticeable.",
        "It\u2019s easier to shave hair when it\u2019s less than .25 inches (0.64 cm) long, so try not to let it grow longer than this.",
        "However, you don\u2019t want to shave your head too often, as this can cause irritation.",
        "Try to shave your head no more than once a week.",
        "If weekly shaves still cause irritation, try going a little longer between shaves.",
        "As an alternative, you could add a shaving oil to your routine or apply moisturizer more often."
