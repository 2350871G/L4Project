Purchase cut flowers from a florist with good quality flowers and lots of variety. If you are going to use a mixed variety of flowers for the arrange, collect five varieties of leaves or shapes. If you are going for a more simple arrangement, look for perhaps one star flower and one complementing flower with a different leaf shape. Ask your wedding planner to recommend a florist or call around and compare prices for wedding arrangements from several florists. There are also online sites where you can order floral arrangements in bulk, a great option if you are creating centerpieces for a large wedding. If you decide to use silk flowers instead of fresh ones, order silk flowers online in bulk and create your own silk flower arrangements. You may want to also consider using succulents or tropical plants to create a unique look for the centerpieces."

When choosing colored candles, keep in mind the overall color scheme (if there is one) for the wedding, and treat the candles almost like flowers.

Ask your wedding planner to recommend a florist or call around and compare prices for wedding arrangements from several florists. There are also online sites where you can order floral arrangements in bulk, a great option if you are creating centerpieces for a large wedding. If you decide to use silk flowers instead of fresh ones, order silk flowers online in bulk and create your own silk flower arrangements. You may want to also consider using succulents or tropical plants to create a unique look for the centerpieces. Pick out vases, jars, or holders. The type of container for the floral arrangements you use should complement the color or theme of the wedding, as well as the size, shape, and color of the flowers. You could use classic glass vases, mason jars, or alternative holders like wicker baskets or clay pots. Look for vessels that are one to two inches shorter than the flowers you are going to use. A wide neck on a vase or jar allows the flowers to sit higher on longer stems, which more narrow vases or jars are usually better for shorter stems. Prepare the centerpieces one day prior to the wedding day. Because you are going to be using fresh cut flowers, avoid wilting buds or dull petals by creating the centerpieces the day before the wedding and then storing them in a cooler or refrigerator until the reception so the flowers remain fresh looking. Gather the containers together, as well as the cut flowers. You will also need a pair of scissors (or several pairs if someone is assisting you) and access to fresh water. Fill the clean container with room temperature water. Fill the container about halfway with water. Visualize the arrangement within a circle. Place the container of water in front of you and spread out your hands to make a circle over the vase. This will help you keep an invisible boundary for the arrangement. Divide the circle into three equal parts. Think of the circle as a peace sign. These three equal parts will allow you to arrange the flowers in a balanced way. Strip off the lower leaves of the stems. Run your hand gently along the stems in a downward motion to remove the leaves. Cut the ends of the stems at an angle. Angling the cut will ensure the flowers last longer and stay fresh in the container. Place one stem of each floral variety into the container. Do this by placing each stem at an angle into the three equal parts you created over the container. It\u2019s fine if they overlap, as long as they are all facing outward, away from the center of the container. If you are using decorative leaves in the arrangement, place these in the container first to act as a nice base for the arrangement. Place the star flowers into the container. Use three stems of the star flower and place them in the three sections of the container. Flowers with shapely bulbs like hydrangeas, lilies, and tulips all make great star flowers. Add the supporting flowers. To add some extra pops of color and texture, slide in the supporting flowers in the three sections of the container to complement the star flowers. Flowers like roses, snap dragons, and lisianthus make great supporting flowers. Finish the arrangement with fillers. Fillers can be flowers with wide green leaves, or thin flowers like baby\u2019s breath or astartea. Primp and adjust the arrangements so it looks even, balanced, and full. Creating a Candle Centerpiece Choose different sized or colored candles. Go for a uniform look with candles that are all the same size and shape or vary the size, shape, and color of candles in a centerpiece to create a unique look for the table. If you\u2019re looking to save on candles, head to your local craft store and buy in bulk. Determine if you want the candles to sit high on the tables, as you will likely purchase tall, thin candles. If you prefer the candles to sit low on the tables, go for wide and short candles. When choosing colored candles, keep in mind the overall color scheme (if there is one) for the wedding, and treat the candles almost like flowers. Think about which colors will work well together and complement each other. Be wary when choosing colored candles if they are also scented, as certain scents do not mix well and you do not want to create an unpleasant smell at the tables during the wedding reception. Pick out candle holders. You may prefer simple glass holders or you may be looking for something a bit more bold like sleek tapers or twisted metal holders. Consider which holders best complement the candles you have chosen, as well as the overall look of the wedding. One interesting idea for a rustic look might be to hollow out logs of white birch and use them to hold the candles on the table. You may also want to customize the holders by wrapping them in fabrics like lace or tulle. Incorporate other details like mirrors, or flowers. Combining candlelight with other details like water, mirrors, or flowers creates an intimate setting for the reception and won\u2019t break your budget. Place mirrors underneath the candles to accentuate the glow of candlelight. Decorate tree branches with hanging candles and use them as an eyecatching center piece. Create an arrangement of several different sizes and heights of candles and then add in cut flowers in small glass jars or simply lay them around the candles on the table. Try a floating candle arrangement. This type of arrangement is a great way to showcase both candles and flowers in water. If you use fresh flowers for this arrangement, assemble them on one day before the wedding or the day of the wedding to ensure the flowers stay fresh.Use any container of your choice. If you are only using one container, look for one that is wide and short so it can fit a few candles and flowers. If you are using several containers, try using ones at different heights or widths. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/8f\\/Make-Wedding-Centerpieces-Step-17Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Make-Wedding-Centerpieces-Step-17Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/8f\\/Make-Wedding-Centerpieces-Step-17Bullet1.jpg\\/aid1395302-v4-728px-Make-Wedding-Centerpieces-Step-17Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nFill the container or containers up with water.
