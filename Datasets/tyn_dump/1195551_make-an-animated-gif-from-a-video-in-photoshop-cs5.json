            "description": "To select only a few frames, check \"Selected Frames Only.\" This option will allow your GIF to be converted much faster. The size/layers will also be smaller so that you can easily edit the GIF. If you do this,  move the slider in the video to your starting point, then hold shift and drag towards the ending point to ensure that a section has been highlighted. Your video will now be converted into layers so you can make it into a GIF. If you have a high frame rate video (over 60 frames per second) then check \"Limit to Every [x] frames\" and type a number in place of 'x'. This will select every 'x'th frame which will make conversion faster and image size lower (and lower quality) by dividing frame rate by 'x'. You would want a frame rate of around 15-30. Then continue by clicking 'OK'"
