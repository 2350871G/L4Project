Instead, visit your local nursery (or even sometimes your local grocery store) and purchase a mint seedling. Look for a seeding that is already at least 3\u20134 inches (7.6\u201310.2 cm) tall. Some varieties of mint include sweet mint, chocolate mint, spearmint, lemon mint, apple mint, and peppermint. Spearmint and peppermint are the most common.
