    "text": " Cleaning Silver Coins Choose a non-metallic container. It should be more than large enough to hold the coins you want to clean. Keep in mind you\u2019ll also need to pour water into this container so choose your container appropriately. Place a sheet of aluminum foil at the bottom of your container. Unroll a sheet of aluminum just large enough to cover the bottom of your container and cut to size. Don\u2019t worry if you have to fold up the corners of the foil for it to fit in your container. Boil water and pour it into the container. Pour water into a saucepan and bring it to a boil on a stovetop. Pour it into your non metallic container until it\u2019s a few inches from the top. You may want to wear gloves or oven mitts in case the water splashes. Add salt and baking soda to the container. Measure half a cup (170g) of baking soda and one tablespoon (14g) of salt. Add them both to the water. Use a stirring stick to help the two substances dissolve in the water. Drop the coins into the solution. Be careful not to drop the coins too quickly, as this could cause the water to splash and burn you. Make sure the coins are placed on the foil in a single layer.

At the very least, you should wear safety goggles to prevent heat or debris from harming your eyes. Consider wearing an apron and gloves to protect yourself as well. Place the coins in a crucible.
