Some involve cutting the cantaloupe in half and then chopping off the rind, and others involve cutting the cantaloupe into slices and then carving the rind off the individual pieces. To get started, place the cantaloupe on a cutting board, and brace the side of it with one hand to keep it from rolling. Use a heavy knife to slice about 1 in (2.5 cm) from the top and bottom of the cantaloupe to make a flat surface. Then, place the cantaloupe on one of the flattened ends and carefully cut it in half. Use a metal spoon to scoop out the seeds and pulp from each pitted half of the cantaloupe. Either trim the rind from each half by placing it flat against the cutting board or cut the halves into 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm) slices and carefully carve the rind from each slice. Finish by dicing the cantaloupe into 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm) cubes."
