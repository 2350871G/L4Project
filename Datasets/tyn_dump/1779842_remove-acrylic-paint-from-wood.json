Switch out the cloth as needed if it becomes too saturated. This may be ineffective on paint stains that have been dry for awhile. Soap and water are most effective on fresh paint stains. Moisten a fresh cloth with hot water and put some soap on it. Use a basic glycerin soap, like dish soap, that will produce a good lather and get into the grain of the wood. You can use liquid or bar soap for this. Scrub the remaining paint gently with the soapy cloth. Keep scrubbing and adding more soap until all the paint is gone. Rub the cloth in straight lines with the grain of the wood to try and get all the paint out of the grooves. Wipe the area with a damp cloth to remove the soap residue. Continue to wipe at the spot until the soap suds are gone. You may need to rinse the cloth once if the spot was really soapy. Use a dry cloth or towel to dry the area. Wipe away as much excess water as possible. The wood will remain damp, and may take up to 48 hours to fully dry depending on the size of the spot. Using Alcohol Scrape the paint stain with a putty knife. Try to gently chip off as much of the top layer of paint as possible. Any paint you can remove this way will be less paint that the alcohol has to cut through. Be careful not to dig into the wood and leave scratch marks behind. Apply some alcohol on a cloth. Use basic rubbing alcohol, which can be purchased at most drugstores or grocery stores. Place the cloth on top of the open bottle and shake it once or twice to saturate a small section of the cloth.

Using a Heat Gun Determine if the painted area is large enough to use a heat gun. If you're removing paint from an entire door or piece of furniture, using a heat gun may be worthwhile. If you only need to remove a few small spots, then other methods, like soap or alcohol, may be a more practical choice.

You can add some soap to the cloth for added cleaning power (see method above for full instructions). Using a Solvent Choose a solvent. The most common paint stripper is methylene chloride. It\u2019s extremely potent and should be used with care. There are solvents that are citrus-based and more environmentally friendly, but these are still dangerous and proper safety precautions should be taken. Solvents can be purchased at your local hardware or paint store. Put on safety gear.

Work outside if possible, but if the wood can\u2019t be moved, open all windows and doors. Set a fan behind you so that the airflow blows the fumes away from you and out a window or door. Roll or brush on solvent. Use a paintbrush or paint roller to apply a thin coat of the solvent to the paint. Allow it to sit for about 20 minutes, or however long the instructions recommend. The paint will begin to bubble as the solvent is working. Scrape off bubbled paint. Use a blunt plastic scraper to scratch off the paint that has begun bubbling and peeling. Avoid using sharp metal tools that will gauge the wood. Collect the peeling paint in a disposable container or plastic bag. Cleanse the area with mineral spirits. Some manufacturers claim that water alone will clean the area, but the best way to ensure the wood is neutralized is to wipe it with a rag soaked in mineral spirits. Wait a week to refinish the wood. Give the wood at least a week to completely dry and air out before you attempt to apply any stains or waxes. Sanding the Wood Rub the paint using steel wool or sandpaper. Use #0000 steel wool or fine sandpaper (150-180 grit). If there\u2019s a lot of paint to remove, start with a coarser sandpaper, like 80-120 grit or, in extreme cases, 40-60 grit.
