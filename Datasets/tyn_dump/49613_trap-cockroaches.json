If you have noticed the cockroaches in your house being particularly attracted to any given food item, try using that as bait. If you wish to outright kill the cockroaches, you can buy gel baits spiked with active ingredients that poison the insects. Bear in mind, however, that these are not always attractive to roaches, and that they may not be as effective as advertised. Contact a local home-and-garden store or pest-control center. Make sure to only use a small portion of your chosen bait. If the bait spills over the edge of the tape, there will be little motivation for cockroaches to get themselves stuck.

        "Smear some cooking oil all around the inside of the top of the bottle.",
        "This will make a slippery slide to the bottom of the bottle.",
        "Alternately, use a pipe cleaner or another long-handled brushing tool to spread petroleum jelly inside the bottle, just below the neck.",
        "This will make it difficult for fallen cockroaches to gain traction when climbing back up.",
        "Set the trap.",
        "Place the wine bottle in a spot where you have seen some cockroaches: near the compost heap, for instance, or in a dark corner of your kitchen.",
        "Leave it out for at least one night.",
        "Bear in mind that it may take a couple of nights to ferment to the right composition to attract the critters.",
        "The cockroaches are attracted to the sweet smell of wine or beer.",
        "They climb onto the top of the bottle, slip on the oil, fall into the bottom, and cannot get back out again.",
        "Consider making a \"trail\" of spilled wine up the side of the bottle.",
        "This may help lead the cockroaches into your trap with the promise of sweeter things to come.",
        "Dispose of the roaches.",
        "When you check your trap in the morning and find cockroaches in the bottom of the bottle, carefully pour some very hot water into the bottle to kill them.",
        "Leave the hot water in the bottle for a minute or two make sure that it's worked \u2013 cockroaches are resilient creatures.",
        "Dispose of the dead roaches by pouring the hot water from the bottle into a garden, a compost heap, or a toilet bowl.",
        "If one bottle doesn't solve your roach infestation, keep trying.",
        "You can set the trap with a new bottle every few days.",
        "Over time, the numbers of caught roaches should decline as there are fewer insects around to fall into your trap.",
        "Try pairing the wine-bottle method with the jar method and the duct-tape method.",
        "Set up different traps in different areas of your home, then observe which works best.",
        "Consider that one trap might be catching more cockroaches due to its location or its bait type \u2013 not necessarily because of its trapping mechanism."
