This should take about 5 minutes for a small stain.Tip: It's important to work with hardened wax. If you begin scraping soft crayon wax, you'll work the wax deeper into the clothing fibers and smear the stain. If there are several stains, put the clothing into a bag and place the bag in the freezer. Chill the fabric until the wax stains harden."
