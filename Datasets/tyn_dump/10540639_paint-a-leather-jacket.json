Avoid oil-based, watercolor, or fabric paints since these may not show up on the jacket and are likely to run. Find acrylic paint in a variety of colors at your local craft supply store. If possible, get an acrylic paint that is specially made for leather, such as Angelus paint. This will help to ensure that the paint will stay put, even if you wear the jacket out in the rain or need to wipe it off with a wet rag to clean it. Make sure that the paint will show up on the jacket! If the jacket is\u2026\nBlack, opt for bright, light colors. Darker colors are unlikely to show up. White, choose any color you like except for white or light pastel colors. A color such as red, blue, or pink, avoid paints in the same color as the jacket. Opt for colors that are lighter and brighter than the jacket and steer clear of colors that are similar to the color of the jacket."
