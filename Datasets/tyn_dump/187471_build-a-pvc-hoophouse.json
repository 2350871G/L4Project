Repeat this process until you reach the \"back\" of the greenhouse. Make three 40 foot (12.2 m) pieces of PVC by gluing together pairs of 20 foot (6.1 m) pipes using PVC joint compound.  Center a 40 foot (12.2 m) pipe down the underside of the series of arches to form a \"spine\" for the greenhouse, using stainless steel wire to make an \"X\" around each intersection. Make sure you locate the ends of the wire on the underside of the spine and so there are no sharp points sticking up that might tear the plastic sheet. You should now have something that resembles the skeleton of a beached whale. Duct tape a 40 foot (12.2 m) pipe along the the long edge of your plastic sheet, then roll it up in a few turns of the sheet (like you're making a scroll) and duct tape it securely in place.
