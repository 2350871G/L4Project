For an edible ball, you can still use styrofoam, but you'll also need aluminum foil, meringue powder, powdered sugar, food coloring, and water. Of course, you'll also need the candy you want to use. If you want to skip the glue altogether, you can use stick candy that you stick into the foam, rather than glue on. You can use any kind of small candy you want, such as jelly beans, peppermint candies, gumballs, candy-coated chocolate candies, or even chocolate kisses. For gravel, try pieces of rock candy or jelly beans. You can also use paint, ribbon, and/or stickers to decorate the pot."

Add in 1/4 to 1/2 of a cup of warm water, a tablespoon at a time, and use a hand mixer to incorporated it in. Keep adding it in until it's a thick paste. Thicker is better for this application.
