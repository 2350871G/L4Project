A powerful degreaser will cut through dirt, grime, mold, and other problematic residue without affecting the temperamental zinc coating. Proceed in small sections until you\u2019ve cleaned the entire surface. Common household products like Comet, mineral spirits, and chlorine bleach can all be used to prepare galvanized steel for painting. If you\u2019re attempting to paint siding panels, roof flashing, or other materials that have seen exposure to the elements, a thorough cleaning is necessary to eliminate any organic contaminants from the outer surface."

That way, you won\u2019t have to worry about the solution interfering with the action of the vinegar, which you\u2019ll be using to rough up the smooth steel.

To ensure an even paint job, it\u2019s important that it come into contact with every part of the exterior. The acid in the vinegar will gently etch the slick zinc-coated finish, giving it a rougher texture that will allow paint to stick better.
