The benefit to a boneless roast is that you don't have to work around and remove the bone, but bone-in roasts are very flavorful and often less expensive. The meat shouldn't be too lean; some fat is required for flavoring and tenderness. Pick a roast that is 4 to 5 lbs. (1.8 to 2.3 kg). Roasts this size offer adequate surface areas to create crusty textures and add to the pulled pork. If you have a large crowd, select several similar sized roasts, rather than one 8 pound roast, for example. This ensures that all of the meat will have the right ratio of fat to meat."
