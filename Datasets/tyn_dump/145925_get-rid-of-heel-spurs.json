The splint stretches your plantar fascia ligament while you're sleeping, which helps to ease the pain. These splints are usually called \"Plantar fasciitis night splints\" or \"heel splints.\" You can buy them online, at sporting goods stores, and from medical equipment facilities. Some splints will come in small, medium, and large sizes. Other brands will fit a range of shoe sizes. You may find the night splint to be uncomfortable at first, but they can be very effective. The night splint assists in holding the plantar fascia and the Achilles tendon in an elongated position during sleeping to expand the fascial sheath. Night splints help in stretching your calf muscle and supporting the arch of your foot. Night splints need to be used each night regularly and failure to wear these nightly limit their effectiveness."

There are 2 surgeries your doctor will discuss with you:\nInstep plantar fasciotomy involves removing a part of the plantar fascia to ease pressure on the nerves in your foot. Nerve injury, arch instability, and rupture of the plantar fascia are all possible complications. However, if the potential benefits of the procedure outweigh the risks, then you may still want to proceed with this treatment option. Endoscopic plantar fasciotomy is very similar to instep plantar fasciotomy, but uses smaller incisions so that you'll heal faster. Endoscopy has a higher rate of nerve damage, so consider this before moving forward with this option."
