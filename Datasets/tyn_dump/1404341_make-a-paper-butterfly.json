If your paper is the same color or pattern on both sides, it doesn\u2019t matter which side you start on. However, if one side is white, or the \u201cbackside,\u201d begin with that side facing up. Choosing the Perfect Paper for Your Butterfly\nIf you're a beginner, choose oversized origami paper. Bigger sheets are easier to work with. For easy folding, use origami paper, because it is thinner than regular paper. If you want to add visual interest, opt for textured paper like linen or felt cardstock. For a dramatic accent, pick foil paper in a shimmery metallic."
