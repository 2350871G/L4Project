Then, take sewing pins and insert them through both pieces of fabric near the circular edge. Try to place a pin every 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm).Tip: It's important to have the right sides of the fabric facing each other. This way you can sew the seam around the circle and turn it inside out. Then, you can sew the circle closed or stuff it if you'd like to make a circular cushion or pillow. Inserting pins will help prevent the circles from shifting off of each other as you're sewing."

Lay 2 fabric circles that are the same size on top of each other so the right sides are touching. Then, take sewing pins and insert them through both pieces of fabric near the circular edge.

You can stop the machine, put the needle down, and lift the foot in order to turn your fabric if you're really having trouble sewing along the curve. Then, put the foot back down and continue sewing slowly. Stop sewing 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the end in order to leave a gap. If you sew the circle closed, you won't be able to turn it right side out. Leave at least a 3 in (7.6 cm) gap at the end so you can reach in and pull the fabric out once you've finished trimming the circle. You can make the gap as large as you'd like. If you're sewing a big circle, you might want to leave a 4 in (10 cm) gap for instance. Cut out triangular pieces of fabric along the entire seam allowance. To prevent your circle from puckering when you turn it right side out, you'll need to remove some of the excess fabric from the seam allowance. Keep the circle inside out and use scissors to cut triangular notches about every \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) around the seam allowance. The size of the notches will depend on the overall size of your circle. Do not cut into the seam or your stitches will begin to unravel. Trim excess fabric from the seam allowance. Use your scissors to cut the seam allowance between your triangular notches. Try to trim it down so there's only about \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) seam allowance left. Repeat this around the entire circle to prevent puckering. Again, take care not to cut into the actual seam. Turn the circle right side out and finish sewing the gap closed.

Then, use your sewing machine to straight stitch across the gap. Leave about \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) seam allowance when you sew the gap closed. Making a Circular Hem Start basting stitches about \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) away from a fabric circle's edge. Begin making straight stitches without backstitching. This will create the baste stitch, which is designed to be loose and temporary. Basting stitches are also called tacking stitches. Baste stitch around the entire perimeter of the circle. Go slowly and straight stitch all the way around the edge of the circle. Use your hands to carefully turn the fabric circle as you work. Remember to leave an \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) seam allowance as you sew. Make another round of basting stitches \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) away from the edge. Once you've sewn basting stitches around the entire circle, go back to where you began. Sew another line of basting stitches around the circle, but leave a \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) seam allowance this time. Although you don't have to make the second row of basting stitches, it's a good idea if the first row of basting stitches breaks when you go to pull it. Grab the end of the threads and pull to gather the fabric. Hold both of the thread ends between your fingers and pull until you see the fabric bunch together. You can use your fingers to distribute the bunched seam allowance so it looks even. The main fabric circle should still be smooth. It's only the seam allowance that will gather up as you pull the thread from the basting stitches. Fold the gathered edge over and pin it in place. In order to create your hem, you'll have to fold the perimeter of the fabric in towards the center of your circle. Ensure that you fold over as much fabric as you'd like for your seam allowance. Then, pin the fabric in place. You'll need to insert a pin about every 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so. For example, if you'd like a \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) seam allowance, fold \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) of fabric over and pin it. Zigzag stitch the hem around the entire circle. Once you've pinned the hem, adjust your sewing machine for a zigzag stitch, which will prevent the fabric from fraying. Sew the zigzag stitch around the hem and remove pins as you go.Tip: You can use any stitch you like for the hem, not just a zigzag stitch! Turn the circle carefully as you slowly zigzag stitch. This will help you make an even curve. There's no need to remove the basting stitches since they're not visible from the right side.",
