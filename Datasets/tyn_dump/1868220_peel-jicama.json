The skin should be unblemished and should not have bruises. The smaller jicama are younger and sweeter. The larger ones are older and starchier - better for boiling and mashing than eating raw. Choose jicama that are heavy for their size. Lighter ones have probably been sitting too long, and their moisture has started to evaporate. Wash the jicama under a stream of cool water. Use a nylon bristled brush or sponge to remove the dirt before rinsing it again. Place the clean jicama on a cutting board. Use a knife to slice away the top and the bottom of the tuber. Using a Vegetable Peeler Place a vegetable peeler at the base of the fruit. Tuck the blade of the vegetable peeler under the fibrous skin. Pull upward on the vegetable peeler. Take a section of the skin off of the jicama. Rotate the jicama and peel away the skin. Keep peeling until all of the skin has been removed. It's important to get every last bit, since eating the skin can give you a stomach ache. Process the jicama. Cut the jicama into matchsticks or cube it according to the instructions in your recipe. Discard the peel in your compost pile or garbage bin. Jicama is delicious prepared the following ways:\n\n Julienned - the matchstick-shaped pieces are for adding to salad and slaw.

Don't let the blade come into contact with your thumb. The skin should peel off as the knife travels upward. Be careful not to remove too much of the flesh as you cut off the peel.
