Focus on getting the horse to follow basic commands, like dropping its head and following along when you pull on the lead. It might take a bit of trial and error before your horse gets the hang of these basic commands, so be patient. To train a horse to drop its head, hold onto the end of the lead that\u2019s close to the horse\u2019s head. Tug downward on the lead very slowly and gently until the horse learns to drop its nose. Pull backwards on the lead gently and carefully to teach the horse to step back."

Over the next few weeks and months, gradually add another furlong or 2 to the workout. Never command your horse to run at top speed\u2014this will tire out and strain your racing companion. Walk or trot your horse for several minutes to cool down. Take your horse around the track at a slow, walking or trotting pace. Give your horse time to lower its heart rate so it doesn\u2019t feel hot, sweaty, and out-of-breath at the end of the training day. Transitioning to the Racetrack Introduce the horse to the stall enclosure at the racetrack. Visit an official racetrack, where your horse can get used to standing in a closed gate. Help your horse adjust to the sudden sounds and movements of the electric gate moving, which will occur every time a race begins. Many trainers will ride and practice with their horses at a racetrack. Train with others to help your horse adjust to a crowded environment. Visit the racetrack at a time when other trainers are around. Run next to other horses so your own horse can adjust to a crowded, loud environment. Additionally, your horse can get used to the dirt flying around, along with other sensory changes.If you don\u2019t train with other horses, your horse could be overwhelmed when it goes to race for the first time. Register for races to start your racing career. Check online for races in your area. Note that high-scale races will likely have a registration fee or some other cost. Before joining high stakes races, see if there are any local competitions that you can join. Publish your workout information online before joining a race. Reach out to the administration of the race you\u2019ve registered for and see if they need your horse\u2019s workout times. If so, take note of your horse\u2019s breeze times, and how many furlongs your horse is currently breezing for. Compile this information into a digital spreadsheet, and send it along to the race administration. For instance, you can include the specific track, the training date, the course (e.g., dirt training), the distance (in furlongs), as well as the horse\u2019s time. If your horse was racing against other horses during practice, note their rank in the spreadsheet as well.",

        "Tap the horse\u2019s bottom lightly with a long riding crop to keep it moving.",
        "This process is also known as \u201clunging.\u201d\nSince the horse will be running in a circular motion at a racetrack, it\u2019s important to get them acclimated to running in a circle early on.Tip: Unless you live on a farm or near a stable, you\u2019ll need to find another place to train your horse.",

        "If your horse is more stubborn or ornery, you may want to use a ring bit or a Houghton bit, which provide you with a little more control.If you can\u2019t decide which bit is best for your horse, talk to a training professional for help.",
        "Use long reins so the horse can learn to turn right and left.",
        "While ground training your racehorse, slide a bridle and a long set of reins onto your horse\u2019s head.",
