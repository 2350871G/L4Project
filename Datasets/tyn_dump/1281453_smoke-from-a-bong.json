Then, pinch some of the ground cannabis between your fingers and drop it into the bowl. Don\u2019t pack the cannabis too tightly or air won\u2019t be able to pass through it. If the cannabis looks pressed down or compacted in the bowl, use something small and thin like a paper clip to stir it up and loosen it. If you're smoking alone, don't pack the bowl more than half full. You can always pack more later. If you're smoking with friends, pack the bowl so the cannabis comes up to the rim of the bowl. Don't pack it any higher or some could fall out as you're smoking."

    "text": " Preparing the Bong Fill the bong with water. Bottled or tap water will work. The exact amount of water you should pour in will vary depending on the size of the bong you\u2019re using. Fill up the bong so the water comes no more than 1 inch (2.54 cm) above the tip of the downstem (the long tube of glass that sticks into the bong). Any more water than that and you could get splashed while you\u2019re smoking. When you\u2019re filling the bong with water, pour the water directly into the mouthpiece (the open part at the top of the bong). Grind up your cannabis. Use your fingers, a pair of scissors, or a grinder. Make sure it\u2019s ground up finely. Break off a couple of larger pieces, about 0.5 cm (0.2 inches) long and wide, to pack at the bottom of the bong bowl. If you're using a grinder, take the lid off and place 2 or 3 buds of cannabis in between the grinder's teeth. Close the lid and twist the lid back and forth to grind up the cannabis inside. Pack the cannabis in the bong bowl. The bowl is the funnel-shaped piece that sits in the outside portion of the downstem. Take the large pieces of cannabis you set aside and pack them in the bowl first; these pieces will prevent the finely ground cannabis from getting sucked through the bowl as you're smoking. Then, pinch some of the ground cannabis between your fingers and drop it into the bowl. Don\u2019t pack the cannabis too tightly or air won\u2019t be able to pass through it.

Don't pack it any higher or some could fall out as you're smoking. Lighting the Bong Get into a comfortable position with the bong. If you\u2019re new to smoking bongs, take a seat near a table or stand so you can set the bong down if you start coughing. Sit near an open window if you don\u2019t want the room to fill with smoke. Make sure the area you're sitting in is free of any flammable objects. Hold the bong with your non-dominant hand. Wrap your hand around the smoke chamber (the long section that connects the mouthpiece and the water chamber) or hold the bong from the bottom. Make sure you have a good grip before you light it. Take a few deep breaths. Breathe using your diaphragm (the muscle below your lungs). Filling your body with oxygen will make it easier to inhale all the smoke from the bong, and you won't cough as much. Put your mouth on the mouthpiece. Your lips should be inside the mouthpiece and the rim of the mouthpiece should be pressed against the area around your mouth. Make sure there aren\u2019t any gaps so the smoke doesn\u2019t escape. Light the lighter with your free hand. Use a regular pocket lighter. Hold the lighter so it\u2019s vertical and light it with your thumb. Keep your other fingers wrapped around the lighter so they don\u2019t get burned. Tilt the lighter on its side and bring the flame to the bowl. Position the flame so you're only burning the edge of the cannabis in the bowl. This will help the cannabis in the bowl last longer. Hold the flame on the edge of the cannabis. Inhaling the Smoke Inhale slowly as you\u2019re lighting the bowl. The smoke shouldn\u2019t be going into your mouth or lungs at this point. You\u2019re just using your inhale to draw the smoke up into the smoke chamber. As you\u2019re inhaling, you should start to see the chamber getting cloudy as it fills with smoke. If you\u2019re new to smoking bongs, only fill the smoke chamber halfway with smoke for your first few tries so you don\u2019t overwhelm yourself. Stop lighting the bowl when you\u2019re satisfied with the amount of smoke. Set the lighter aside or hold it in your hand. Stop inhaling, but don\u2019t remove your mouth from the mouthpiece or the smoke in the smoke chamber will escape. Pull the bowl out of the stem and inhale the smoke in the chamber. Use the same hand you used to light the bowl to pull the bowl out of the stem. When you\u2019re inhaling the smoke, inhale deeply so it goes into your lungs. If you can\u2019t inhale the smoke in the chamber all at once, take your mouth off the mouthpiece and cover the mouthpiece with the palm of your hand so the smoke doesn\u2019t escape. When you\u2019re ready to inhale the rest of the smoke, remove your hand and quickly put your mouth back on the mouthpiece. Hold the smoke in your lungs for a few seconds. Holding the smoke in for longer won't get you higher, and it could be worse for your health. Holding the smoke in for 2-3 seconds will be enough to get you high. Exhale the smoke.

If you\u2019re smoking alone, relight the bowl when you\u2019re ready to take another hit. If you\u2019re smoking with friends, pass the bong and lighter to the person next to you. If you're all done with the bong, remove the bowl and pour out the water. Thoroughly rinse the bong and place it in a safe spot where it won't get damaged.",
