If you do need to groom the kitten prior to eight weeks, use a soft, damp cloth to spot clean soiled areas of the kitten's fur instead of giving the kitten a bath. Even if the kitten doesn't need a bath at eight weeks, this is the ideal time to start acclimating a kitten to baths if you want to be able to bathe the cat into adulthood for purposes of showing the cat or to cut back on your personal allergies to the cat's fur.

Run one or two inches of warm (not hot) water (just enough to cover the paws) with the kitten in the bathroom, so the kitten adjusts to the sound of running water as well. You may need to close the door to stop any escape attempts. Keep a hand under the kitten's belly for support and lower the kitten's paws down into the water. Offer petting and praise to calm the kitten down, and offer the kitten treats after standing for several minutes without fighting the water or trying to escape the tub. If the kitten won't calm down in the water, then don't offer the praise and treats since you'll reinforce the wrong behavior. Instead, remove the kitten and try again the following day. You may have to repeat the process for several days before the kitten stands in the water without a struggle. If at any stage your kitten panics, gently grasp her by the scruff and lift her up out of the water. Holding the kitten by the scruff has a naturally calming effect and will help her to relax. You may want to place a grippy mat at the bottom of the tub since the kitten is more likely to panic if slipping around on the wet tub floor."

        "Ensure that you use a shampoo for kittens and not human shampoo.",
        "The pH balance is very different, and human shampoo will overly dry your kitten's skin.",
        "Even after you kitten has adjusted to the shampooing, you should still only use it every other time you bathe your cat to keep from over drying the kitten's skin.",
        "Rinse the kitten thoroughly.",
        "Since the kitten should already be accustomed to you pouring the water, you should easily be able to rinse the shampoo off the kitten now.",
        "For any soap around the top of the kitten's head, use a clean, wrung-out washcloth to wipe out the shampoo instead of pouring water on your kitten's head.",
        "Keep it quick.",
        "Don't rush, but don't leave the kitten to soak in the water either.",
        "The entire process for wetting, scrubbing, and rinsing the kitten should only take about five minutes.",
        "You don't want to test the kitten's patience for the whole process as this can make it harder for the cat to acclimate to baths in the long run.",
        "As with all steps in the process, stay calm and use a soothing, reassuring voice to offer consistent praise to the kitten during the bath.",
        "This should help keep the kitten calmer for longer.",
        "Dry the kitten thoroughly.",
        "As with any of the other steps that required the kitten getting wet, you should gently towel dry the kitten as soon as you remove it from the water to avoid the kitten getting too cold.",
        "Though a towel is preferable, if you want to use a blowdryer to dry the kitten, ensure that you use the coolest temperature on the lowest speed setting and keep the blowdryer at least twelve inches away from the animal."
