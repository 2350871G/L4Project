Also, there are traditionally two types of tile--those that come with a peel-off adhesive on the back and those that have no adhesive. The peel-off adhesive style is typically more expensive. If you purchase the tile with no adhesive, you may also have to buy carpet glue or double-sided carpet tape. Select a carpet tile that blends in with the room\u2019s style and colors, rather than a tile that stands out."

Alternate your tiles for different designs. Instead of facing all of your tiles in a single direction, alternate every other tile to face in a different direction. This will make your carpet tiles look unique. Try out different configurations and styles on your paper design before committing to a design. Fitting the Tiles Vacuum and wipe down the floor. Use a floor vacuum and get all of the dust and dirt from off the surface of your floor. Then, use a damp mop or rag to wipe down the floor that you plan on laying the tile over.

Use a tape measure to measure the distance between the wall and the outer edge of the carpet. You will fill in this space with a cut tile. Using pieces that are thinner than 4 inches (10 cm) to fill in the gaps may look strange.

Apply carpet tape or glue to the back of the tiles if there's no adhesive. Unpeel one side of the tape and press it against the back corner of your carpet tile. If you are using a carpet glue, apply the glue in a straight line on each edge on the back of the carpet. Work on a single carpet tile at a time when applying any adhesive.
