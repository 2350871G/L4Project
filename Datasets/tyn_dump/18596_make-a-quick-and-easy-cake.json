    "text": " Making a Simple Yellow Cake Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) and prepare your baking pan. Lightly grease the inside of a square, 8-inch (20.32 centimeters) cake pan, then dust it with flour. To make the cake even easier to remove, line the pan with some parchment paper or aluminum foil first. Beat the eggs until they turn thick. You can do this using an electric mixer, a handheld mixer, or a food processor fitted with whisks. You can also do it by hand in a large mixing bowl using a whisk, but this will take more time. Add the sugar into the eggs a little bit at a time, then the vanilla extract. Keep beating the eggs and sugar until they are evenly combined, then stir in the vanilla extract. Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt into a separate bowl. This ensures that your flour, baking powder, and salt will distribute evenly throughout the cake instead of collecting in clumps. Slowly stir the flour mixture into the egg mixture. Use a rubber spatula to combine the two together. Be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl. There should be no streaks or dry patches. If you are using an electric mixer or a food processor, you can pulse the mixtures together for a few seconds. In a small saucepan, heat the milk and butter until the butter melts. Heating the milk up beforehand will give you a light, fluffy cake. If the milk is too cold, your cake will be too heavy and dense. Do not let the milk come to a boil. Slowly stir the milk mixture into the batter. Again, make sure that the milk is hot, but not boiling. Also, make sure that you add the milk slowly. If you pour it in too fast, you will end up cooking the eggs. Bake the cake for 25 minutes. It is ready when the sides shrink back from the pan, and the center springs back when you press on it or when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cake cool for 10 to 15 minutes before inverting it onto a plate. If you used a spring form cake pan, simply open up the pan, and peel the sides away from the cake. Dust the cake with powdered sugar, or frost it with your choice of buttercream frosting. For a fancier cake, cut the cake in half, and spread your favorite jam onto one of the halves before putting it back together. Making a Yogurt Cake Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) and lightly grease your baking pan. Grease the inside of an 8\u00bd by 4\u00bc by 2 \u00bd-inch (21.59 by 10.8 by 6.35 centimeters) loaf pan. Dust the pan with flour, then tap the excess flour out. Alternatively, you can also use a round, 8-inch (20.32 centimeters) cake pan. Beat the eggs until the yolks break. You can do this either by hand, or by using an electric mixer. If you are using an electric mixer, it will take about 30 seconds. Add the yogurt, sugar, oil, lemon zest, and vanilla extract, and beat again until smooth. Keep beating until everything is evenly combined and the color is even. You do not want to see any streaks of egg yolk. If you are using an electric mixer, this will take about 1 minute. Add the flour, baking powder, and salt, beat again for another minute or so. Make sure that there are no lumps or clumps of flour, and that everything is evenly blended together. Pour the batter into the cake pan, then bake it for 50 to 55 minutes. The cake is done when a toothpick poked into the middle comes out clean. If you are using an 8-inch (20.32 centimeters) round cake pan, the cake will be ready in about 30 to 40 minutes. Let the cake cool for 10 to 15 minutes, then invert it onto a serving plate. At this point, your cake is done and ready to serve, but there's a few extra steps you can do to take it to the next level. If you'd like to serve your cake as is, consider dusting it with some powdered sugar. In a small saucepan, cook \u2153 cup (75 grams) of sugar and \u2153 cup (80 milliliters) of lemon juice, then pour it over the cake. In a small saucepan, heat the sugar and lemon juice, stirring occasionally. When the sugar dissolves, pour the mixture over the still-warm cake. Let the lemon-sugar mixture soak in; this will make the cake extra-moist. Prepare the glaze, then pour it over the cake. In a cup, whisk together 1 cup (125 grams) of powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of lemon juice. Pour the mixture over the cake, and let it set. Making a No-Bake Strawberry Cake Prepare the strawberries. Wash the strawberries, and gently pat them dry. Chop off the stems, then the strawberries into thin slices. Save some of the better looking strawberries to use on top of your cake. If you don't like strawberries, you can use other types of soft fruit, such as bananas, blueberries, or mango. Beat the heavy cream until it forms stiff peaks. You can do this using an electric mixer, a handheld mixer, or even a food processor fitted with whisks. Add the powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Beat the ingredients again until everything is evenly combined. If the whipped cream is still too wet, beat in some more powdered sugar; if the whipped cream is too dry, beat in some more cream. Use a rubber spatula to spread some of the whipped cream onto the bottom of a 9 by 13-inch (22.86 by 33.02 centimeters) baking dish. You won't need a lot; about a spoonful will do. This thin layer of cream will help hold your first layer of graham crackers in place. Consider using a glass dish. You won't be taking this cake out of the dish, so a glass dish will allow you to see all the different layers. Cover the bottom of the dish with several graham crackers. If you are using a 9 by 13-inch (22.86 by 33.02 centimeters baking dish, you will need about 6 graham crackers. Make sure that you use enough graham crackers so that you can't see the bottom of the baking dish. You can split some of the graham crackers into smaller pieces if you need to, but don't crumble them up. If you plan to serve this at home, consider building this cake on top of a fancy serving platter. Divide the whipped cream into fourths. This will make it easier to measure the whipped cream out when you start making your layers. Simply divide the whipped cream between four cups or four small bowls. Using a rubber spatula, spread one-fourth of the whipped cream on top of the graham crackers. Don't worry about making the whipped cream layer perfectly smooth on top. Make sure, however, that it goes from edge to edge of the baking dish, and that it covers all of the graham crackers evenly. If you are building this on top of a platter, consider piping the whipped cream around the edges of the cake using a star-shaped decorating tip. This will make the cake look nicer. Add a single layer of sliced strawberries. Take your strawberries, and start layering them across the top of the whipped cream. Place the strawberries close enough so that they touch, but not so close that they overlap. Repeat the graham cracker, cream, and strawberry layer three more times. Use one-fourth of the whipped cream for each layer. You will have one last cup/bowl of whipped cream left over by the time you are done. Finish off with a final layer of graham crackers and the rest of the whipped cream. You can smooth the whipped cream down using a rubber spatula, or swirl it around using the back of a spoon. For a fancier touch, put the whipped cream into a piping bag fitted with a star-shaped tip, and pipe little \"stars\" around the edges of the cake. Garnish the top of the cake with the strawberries you set aside earlier. You can leave the strawberries whole, your you can slice them for a different look. Prepare the ganache, if desired. You will be drizzling the ganache over the top of the cake for that final touch. It is not completely necessary, but it will make your cake look and taste great. If you'd like to add a ganache drizzle, do the following:\nIn a small saucepan, heat \u00bc cup (60 milliliters) of heavy cream until small bubbles form. Put the chopped chocolate into a small bowl, then pour the cream on top. Wait a few minutes, then stir the mixture with a whisk. Keep stirring until the ganache is thick and smooth. Drizzle the ganache over the top of your cake. The easiest way to do this is with a spoon. You can also pour the ganache into a plastic squeeze bottle, and then drizzle it over the cake that way. Refrigerate the cake for at least 4 hours. The cake is ready when a knife poked into the center comes out with a few, soft crumbs; the knife should pass through the graham crackers easily. Using Cake Mix Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) and lightly grease the inside of your baking pan.  Read the instructions on the box and gather your ingredients. Each brand of cake mix will be a little different, so the exact amounts will vary. You will be using the same measurements that your cake mix calls for, but you will be using different ingredients. This will make your cake taste more homemade. Melt enough butter to replace the oil in your recipe, then pour it into a large mixing bowl. Read how much oil your cake mix needs\u2014it is typically around \u00bd cup (115 grams)\u2014then use that amount in butter instead. Cut the butter into cubes, then melt it in the microwave or in a saucepan over the stove. The butter will make your cake rich and flavorful.Vegan or want the cake to be fat-free? Try applesauce instead! You do not need to heat the applesauce. Beat in the exact number of eggs that the box calls for, plus 1 extra. Most cake mixes call for about 2 or 3 eggs. This means that you should be using 3 or 4 eggs instead. Add the eggs in one at a time into the mixing bowl, beating with a whisk after each addition. Keep beating until the eggs and butter are well combined. Pour in some milk instead of water, then beat again. Read how much water the box calls for, measure out some milk instead, then slowly pour it into your mixing bowl while stirring. The amounts may vary from brand to brand, but it is typically around 1\u2153 cups (320 milliliters). The milk will add extra richness and flavor to your cake.You can also use hot water in place of cold/room temperature water if you are making a chocolate cake. This will bring out the chocolate flavor. For an even richer cake, use buttermilk instead. Vegan or can't have dairy? Try full-fat coconut milk instead. Whisk in the cake mix. You may want to sift the cake mix first to break up any lumps or clumps. Keep whisking the batter until everything is well-combined; be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl often. Consider adding some extras into the batter. These extras are not necessary, but they can take your cake to the next level and make it taste as though it was made from scratch! Here are some ideas to get you started:\nIf you are making a white cake, add \u00bd teaspoon of vanilla extract. If you are making a chocolate cake, add in a handful of chocolate chips or chocolate shavings. If you are making carrot cake, add in some grated carrot for a hint of freshness. If you know that the cake is going to be very sweet, add \u00bc teaspoon of salt and 1 to 2 teaspoons of fresh lemon juice. This only works for white or yellow cake mixes. Pour the batter into a greased baking pan(s). Depending on the cake mix you bought, and the type of pan you are using, you will have enough to fill one or two pans. Every cake mix will be different, but here are some general guidelines:\nWith one box of cake mix, you can typically fill two 8 or 9-inch (20.32 or 22.86 centimeters) round cake pans. With one box of cake mix, you can fill one 9 by 13-inch (22.86 by 33.02 centimeters) baking pan. Place the pan(s) into the oven, and bake them according to the instructions on the box. Again, every type of cake mix will have slightly different baking times. The size of your pan will also make a difference. In general, however:\nAn 8-inch (20.32 centimeters) round cake will bake in 26 to 31 minutes. A 9-inch (22.86 centimeters) round cake will bake in 24 to 29 minutes. A 9 by 13-inch (22.86 by 33.02 centimeters) sheet cake will bake 26 to 31 minutes. Remove the cake(s) from the oven and let it cool completely. Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes first, then invert it onto a plate, and let it finish cooling. The cake must be completely cool before you add frosting onto it. Decorate your cake. Cut the cake in half using a piece of thread or a bread knife, then spread some frosting or jam on the inside. Put the cake back together, then use a butter knife or off-set cake decorating spatula to spread more frosting on the top and sides of the cake.",
