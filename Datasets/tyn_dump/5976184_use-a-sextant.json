Sextants typically consist of a sighting scope, a pair of mirrors that allow you to view the horizon and an object in the sky (like the sun or a star) at the same time, and a movable arm that measures angles along a 60\u00b0 arc. This arc represents 1/6 of a circle, which is where the name \u201csextant\u201d comes from.

This correction only applies to relatively close objects that appear circular through the sextant scope, like the sun and moon.

If you got an altitude measurement of 38\u00b0 10.60\u2019 for the sun, after correcting for dip you would get 38\u00b0 10.60\u2019 - 9.16\u2019 = 38\u00b0 1.44\u2019. Consult the Nautical Almanac to correct for refraction errors. Refraction refers to the way light bends when it passes through the earth\u2019s atmosphere. This effect changes the way objects appear in the sky and makes them look slightly displaced, just like the way a drinking straw looks displaced or bent through water in a glass. Since refraction varies depending on a variety of factors, including which celestial body you\u2019re trying to observe, it\u2019s easiest to make this correction using a correction table. Check page A2 of the Nautical Almanac to find refraction correction tables.You can purchase the latest Nautical Almanac from an online bookstore. Many of the tables in the almanac are also available for free on a variety of websites related to navigation and sailing. Refraction always makes objects appear higher than they actually are, which means that the correction is always negative. You must subtract it from the apparent altitude. The correct refraction reading will depend on your apparent altitude measurement. Use a semi-diameter correction if you\u2019re observing the sun or moon. The apparent sizes of the sun and moon change depending on the time of year (in the case of the sun) or month (in the case of the moon). These changes can affect your elevation reading, so you\u2019ll need to make adjustments for accuracy. Check the back of your Nautical Almanac to find out what correction you need to apply to your altitude measurement depending on the time of year or phase of the moon.Add the semi-diameter correction to your observed altitude after correcting for index error, dip, and refraction. For example, if you were taking a measurement of the sun\u2019s altitude in April, the semi-diameter correction would be 15.9\u2019. This correction only applies to relatively close objects that appear circular through the sextant scope, like the sun and moon. The semi-diameter correction adjusts your reading from the bottom curve of the circle (the lower limb) to its center. More distant stars and planets just look like points of light, so this adjustment isn\u2019t necessary for them. Make a parallax correction using your Nautical Almanac. Parallax refers to the apparent difference in position of an observed object depending on your vantage point. The right parallax correction depends on which celestial body you\u2019re observing (i.e., the sun, the moon, or a planet) and the altitude you observed. Check the parallax correction tables on page A2 of your Nautical Almanac. Add the parallax correction after adjusting for index error, dip, refraction, and semi-diameter to get the true altitude of your observed object.The parallax correction accounts for the difference between your vantage point on the surface of the Earth and what you would see from the center of the Earth. The combined correction for parallax, semi-diameter, and refraction is known as the \u201cthird correction.\u201d\nFor example, if your observed altitude for the sun was 38\u00b0 10.60\u2019 and you made your observation in April, you might make your corrections as follows:\n38\u00b0 10.60\u2019 + 1.2\u2019 (index error) = 38\u00b0 11.8'\n38\u00b0 11.8' - 9.16\u2019 (dip) = 38\u00b0 2.64\u2019\n38\u00b0 2.64\u2019 - 1.1\u2019 (refraction) = 38\u00b0 1.54\u2019\n38\u00b0 1.54\u2019 + 15.9\u2019 (semi-diameter) = 38\u00b0 17.44\u2019\n38\u00b0 17.44\u2019 + 0.1\u2019 (parallax) = 38\u00b0 17.45\u2019 (true altitude) Finding Your Latitude in the Daytime Find the sun\u2019s angle of elevation at its highest point. At noon (12:00 PM by your local standard time), use your sextant to measure the altitude of the sun. The sun\u2019s altitude at noon will vary depending on your latitude and the time of year. Tip: The spring and fall equinoxes fall close to the 20th of March and the 23rd of September, respectively. However, the exact date changes from one year to another. Check online or look at the Farmer\u2019s Almanac to determine when the equinoxes will fall in a given year. For example, if you were at the equator and taking your measurement during the spring or fall equinox, the sun would be exactly 90\u00b0 overhead at noon. If you were at one of the poles, it would be at exactly 0\u00b0 (on the horizon). Make corrections for index error, dip, refraction, semi-diameter, and parallax. To get an accurate latitude measurement, you\u2019ll need to apply the standard corrections to your reading of the sun\u2019s altitude. If your sextant has any index error (difference between a measurement taken at the horizon and 0\u00b0), take it into account. Measure the height of your eye, add it to any additional elevation above sea level, and use the 1.7725\u2019 x \u221aht (ht being height) formula to correct for dip. Finally, consult the tables in your Nautical Almanac to find the corrections for refraction, semi-diameter, and parallax. Apply the corrections as follows:\nObserved altitude of the sun\n+/- index error (+ if the difference is negative, - if it\u2019s positive)\n- dip\n- refraction\n+ semi-diameter\n+ parallax\n= true altitude of the sun Subtract your corrected altitude from 90\u00b0. Once you have your numbers, you\u2019ll need to account for the difference between the sun\u2019s altitude at the equator versus its altitude at your actual latitude. Use 90\u00b0 as your starting point, since this is the sun\u2019s altitude at the equator at noon during the equinox. For example, if you got a reading of 82\u00b0 17.3\u2019, subtract this from 90\u00b0 to get 7\u00b0 42.7\u2019. Use the Nautical Almanac to determine the declination of the sun. The declination of the sun refers to the difference in altitude of the sun at any given time of year from its position during the spring and fall equinoxes. Depending on the time of year, the sun will appear higher or lower in the sky. Check the correct declination for the sun depending on the time of year in the tables in your Nautical Almanac. For example, on February 1st, the declination is 17\u00b0 12\u2019 south of the equator. The declination of the sun is at its highest (23\u00b0 north of the equator) on the June solstice and lowest (23\u00b0 south) on the winter solstice. Add or subtract the declination of the sun to find your latitude. Depending on the position of the sun relative to the equator, you\u2019ll need to either add or subtract the declination from your previous calculation to find your latitude. If the sun is north of the equator, add the declination. If it\u2019s to the south, subtract it.For example, if you got a measurement of 7\u00b0 42.7\u2019 after subtracting the sun\u2019s altitude from 90\u00b0, and it\u2019s currently April 13, the sun is north of the equator and its declination is 8\u00b0 54\u2019. Add 7\u00b0 42.7\u2019 + 8\u00b0 54\u2019 to get 16\u00b0 36.57\u2019. This is your latitude!",
