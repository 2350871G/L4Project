                    "description": "The softness of a specialty suede brush makes it the best tool for fixing your favorite shoes. When brushing out suede, work in one direction. Brush along the grain, in the direction of the suede\u2019s fibers. Always sweep off as much debris as possible before attempting any other treatments. Consider investing in a suede treatment kit, which often comes with a brush and a cleaning eraser. You can find them online or at many general stores. If you don\u2019t have a suede brush available, try using a clean nylon toothbrush instead."

Continue brushing until the surface of the shoe looks even and clean. Then, repeat the treatment with any remaining marks to bring the suede back to its original state. Be careful to brush over the damaged spots only. Avoid rubbing the clean areas on the suede. If you can\u2019t scrub out the scuff marks, rub them with a cleaning eraser. The eraser restores the suede's texture."

Pull the edge of the knife against the grain slowly, taking care not to touch the undamaged portion of your shoe. If you don\u2019t have a knife, you could also try using a plastic razor or an emery board. Stay away from sharp or serrated blades, if possible, to reduce the chances of cutting into the suede. Be very cautious if you choose to use a sharp knife."

Once the iron gets hot, move it across the towel to make the damaged portions of the suede more pliable. Remove the towel when you\u2019re done and brush the suede out again. Heat can be very damaging for suede, so don\u2019t apply the iron directly to your shoes. Also, keep the iron moving at all times so it doesn\u2019t linger in any spot for more than 3 seconds. Another way to do this is to boil a pot of water on the stove, then hold the shoe over it. Let the steam hit the damaged area, then scrub it with a brush."

        "Then, repeat the treatment with any remaining marks to bring the suede back to its original state.",
        "Be careful to brush over the damaged spots only.",
        "Avoid rubbing the clean areas on the suede.",
        "If you can\u2019t scrub out the scuff marks, rub them with a cleaning eraser.",
        "The eraser restores the suede's texture.",
        "Scrape the scuff mark with a dull knife if it won\u2019t come out.",
        "Scuff marks happen when the suede fibers get too matted down.",
        "Use a butter knife or something similar to lift the fibers.",
        "Pull the edge of the knife against the grain slowly, taking care not to touch the undamaged portion of your shoe.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a knife, you could also try using a plastic razor or an emery board.",
        "Stay away from sharp or serrated blades, if possible, to reduce the chances of cutting into the suede.",
        "Be very cautious if you choose to use a sharp knife.",
        "Buff creases by wiping them in a circle with a brush.",
        "If your shoe still has creases on it, scrub it using the suede brush, a nylon toothbrush, or a towel.",
        "Go around the crease repeatedly to smooth it out.",
        "You can also push and pull on the suede to flatten the creased area as you massage it back to shape.",
        "Start off by going in the direction of the grain to prevent as much wear and tear on the suede as possible.",
        "Heat creases and stains with steam if you still can\u2019t remove them.",
        "Cover the shoe with a towel.",
        "Then, set an iron to the steam function or its lowest possible setting if you don\u2019t have that option.",
        "Once the iron gets hot, move it across the towel to make the damaged portions of the suede more pliable.",
        "Remove the towel when you\u2019re done and brush the suede out again.",
        "Heat can be very damaging for suede, so don\u2019t apply the iron directly to your shoes.",
        "Also, keep the iron moving at all times so it doesn\u2019t linger in any spot for more than 3 seconds.",
        "Another way to do this is to boil a pot of water on the stove, then hold the shoe over it.",
        "Let the steam hit the damaged area, then scrub it with a brush.",
        "Repairing Water Damage Blot moisture out of the shoes with a cloth or paper towel.",
        "As soon as you notice a liquid spill on your suede shoes, treat it to remove as much of the moisture as you can.",
        "Pat the damp areas.",
        "Replace the cloth or towel with a fresh one once it gets saturated with water.",
        "Keep patting the suede until you are unable to absorb more water off of it.",
        "By treating the suede quickly, you can lessen stains before they form.",
        "Always dry out the existing moisture before trying to treat any stains you notice.",
        "Wait up to 24 hours for the shoes to dry out.",
        "Suede becomes more prone to damage when it is wet.",
        "You won\u2019t be able to get all the moisture out by patting the shoes dry, so let them air dry on their own.",
        "Keep them away from heat and direct sunlight during this time.",
        "After the wait, check that the shoes feel completely dry to the touch.",
        "The amount of time you need to wait will depend on how soaked the shoes got.",
        "If you got caught in the rain, for instance, expect to need to wait the whole 24 hours.",
        "Treating the shoes before they dry could lead to cracks in the suede.",
        "Don\u2019t rush to treat stains if the shoes don\u2019t feel dry.",
        "Use a suede brush to spread a light coating of water across the shoe.",
        "Dip the brush into clean, lukewarm water and shake out the excess moisture.",
        "Then, brush the entire shoe along the suede's grain.",
        "Make sure the entire shoe feels slightly moistened before you attempt to treat the stains.",
        "Adding more water may seem strange, but it is the best way to eliminate a water stain.",
        "Cleaning the entire shoe prevents more discolorations from forming.",
        "Dab the suede with a rag to distribute the water evenly across it.",
        "Dampen a clean cloth by touching the moisture on your shoe.",
        "Use the cloth to pat down the surface of the shoe, ensuring every part of the suede gets wet.",
        "Pay particular attention to the water stains, since they need to be dampened again before they can be removed.",
        "The cloth will also remove excess moisture on the suede.",
        "Every part of the suede needs to be damp, not just the water spots.",
        "Doing this blends in the marks while preventing new ones from forming.",
        "Stuff the shoe with paper to help it keep its shape.",
        "Set the shoe on a flat surface with the opening face up.",
        "Then, fill it with paper towels, rags, or other undyed pieces of paper.",
        "Crumple up the paper and fit as many as you can inside the shoe.",
        "Newspaper contains ink that could bleed off and stain the shoe, so avoid using it.",
        "If you have a shoe tree, insert it instead for a much simpler way to maintain the shoe\u2019s shape.",
        "Set the shoe in a cool, dark place to dry overnight.",
        "Put the shoes out in an area with good air circulation.",
        "Suede can take a long time to dry, so you may need to wait a full 24 hours if your shoes are very wet.",
        "Make sure the suede feels completely dry to the touch before you continue fixing it.",
        "Let the shoes air dry naturally.",
        "Since suede is delicate, keep it away from heat and direct sunlight.",
        "Water makes the suede more delicate, so make absolutely sure it dries out.",
        "Err on the side of caution before brushing it again!",
        "Brush over the shoe to finish cleaning it.",
        "Use a suede brush or a clean nylon toothbrush.",
        "Lightly brush the entire shoe along the suede\u2019s grain.",
        "When your done, the suede should be back to its original appearance.",
        "If you still notice stains in the suede, treating them with vinegar or an eraser could help.",
        "Treating Salt and Other Stains Scrub the stain with a suede eraser to attempt to remove it.",
        "A lot of stains come out right away when you use an eraser.",
        "Buy a suede-specific eraser, then rub it across the stain.",
        "Keep rubbing the stain until it\u2019s gone.",
        "Finish by brushing out the suede with a suede brush.",
        "Purchase an eraser by shopping online or visiting a general store.",
        "If you need a brush as well, look for suede cleaning kits that include both tools.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a suede eraser, try using a regular pink pencil eraser.",
        "It\u2019s not as effective, but it\u2019s useful for eliminating minor stains.",
        "Mix 2 parts water with 1 part white vinegar in a bowl if the stain remains.",
        "You don\u2019t need to make a lot in order to treat stains.",
        "Try mixing about \u20444  c (59 mL) of white vinegar with \u20442  c (120 mL) warm water, for instance.",
        "If you\u2019re worried about exposing your shoe to water, you could also dab a cotton ball in vinegar and use it to scrub out the stain.",
        "Rubbing alcohol can be used in place of the vinegar.",
        "Get it at a pharmacy, then mix it into the water or dab a cotton ball into it.",
        "Another option to try is micellar water, a product normally used to rinse off makeup.",
        "Add a little bit to a cotton ball and scrub away the stains!",
        "Apply the mixture to the stains by using a clean rag or towel.",
        "To avoid damaging the suede, don\u2019t pour the mixture onto your shoe.",
        "Instead, dip a clean cloth into it, squeezing out the excess moisture.",
        "Pat the cloth onto the stains you wish to treat.",
        "Finish by rubbing the stain in a circle.",
        "If you\u2019re worried about exposing your shoes to too much moisture, get a cotton ball instead and apply the solution the same way you would with a cloth.",
        "Wait overnight for the shoe to dry.",
        "The amount of time you need to wait depends on how wet the suede is.",
        "It won\u2019t take more than a few hours for spot treatment, but make sure the suede feels completely dry to the touch.",
        "If the stains were minor, they will also be gone after the suede dries.",
        "Always let suede dry after applying moisture to it.",

        "When you\u2019re done, check the shoe over for any remaining stains or signs of damage.",
        "You may need to treat the suede a few times to eliminate stubborn stains.",
        "Your shoes may smell like vinegar or rubbing alcohol when you\u2019re done.",
        "It will fade over time as you wear them.",
        "Removing Oil Damage Pour cornstarch or baby powder over the oil.",
        "Position the shoe in a spot where you will be able to leave it undisturbed for a few hours.",
        "Then, cover the stain completely with a layer of the absorbent material.",
        "Cornstarch and baby powder are both good at drawing oils out of suede so they don\u2019t set in as permanent stains.",
        "This treatment is effective for stains like sweat, grease, and gasoline.",
        "If you\u2019re treating another type of liquid stain, consider using vinegar instead.",
        "Leave the shoe overnight so the powder draws up the oil.",
        "It needs time to work, so wait at least 1 hour.",
        "If you have more time to spare, you will likely notice better results.",
        "Make sure the stained area stays covered by the powder the entire time.",
        "Keep your shoes away from fans or open windows, or else you may end up losing the powder before it has a chance to work on the stain.",
        "Also, avoid leaving the shoes near heat or direct sunlight.",
        "Use a suede brush to sweep away the powder.",
        "Sweep the powder off into a trash bag to avoid scattering it throughout your home.",
        "Then, brush the entire shoe off along the suede\u2019s grain.",
        "This will fluff up the fibers so the suede looks bright and clean again.",
        "If you notice a large amount of oil still on the suede, apply another coating of cornstarch or baby powder.",
        "Let it dry, then brush it off again.",
        "Treat stubborn stains with a cotton ball dipped in white vinegar.",
        "Apply a little bit of the vinegar to a cotton ball or clean cloth.",
        "Make sure it isn\u2019t soaked or dripping before you use it.",
        "Then, scrub the stains lightly in a circle.",
        "Brush the shoe off again when you\u2019re done.",
        "Use only a little bit of vinegar to avoid soaking the suede in it.",
        "You can also use rubbing alcohol or a suede cleaner.",
        "Repeat the treatment if needed to restore the suede.",
        "Use more powder to lift up oil and then repeat scrubbing stains with vinegar.",
        "You may need to do this a few times to get the suede back to normal.",
        "Finish each cleaning with a thorough brushing to lift up the suede\u2019s fibers and blend in any permanent wear and tear."
