        "Grilling Your Steak Heat one side of a 2-temperature grill.",
        "Since charcoal grills heat unevenly, it\u2019s best to use a 2-sided gas grill for this method.",
        "Turn one side up as high as you can, and leave the other side turned off or very low.",
        "If you're using a charcoal grill, try to group your coals together in one corner of the grill.",

        "Season both sides with salt and pepper or your favorite steak seasoning blend.",
        "Place your steak on the low-heat side of your grill.",
        "The reason this is called the reverse sear method is because you bring the meat up to temperature slowly, then sear it at the end, unlike traditional cooking methods where you sear the meat first and then cook it slowly.",
        "A reverse sear cooks the steak more evenly and results in a more tender, juicy steak.",
        "Use a meat thermometer to determine how long to cook your steak.",
        "Let the steak cook slowly, turning it every 3-4 minutes.",
        "Use your meat thermometer to keep track of the temperature.",
        "You want to know when the meat is about 15 \u00b0F (8.3 \u00b0C) below your ideal doneness.",
        "The internal temperature for rare steak is 125 \u00b0F (52 \u00b0C).",
        "For medium rare it\u2019s 130\u2013135 \u00b0F (54\u201357 \u00b0C), for medium 135\u2013140 \u00b0F (57\u201360 \u00b0C), medium-well 140\u2013150 \u00b0F (60\u201366 \u00b0C), and well 155 \u00b0F (68 \u00b0C).",
        "Well done is not recommended for premium steaks.",
        "Move the steak to the hot side of the grill when it reaches your preferred temperature.",
        "Cook the steak on the hot side of the grill until you develop that nice crust on both sides.",
        "This should only take a few minutes, and you can flip the steak as often as you like.",
        "Use the meat thermometer to make sure you don\u2019t overcook your steak.",
        "Allow the steak to rest for 5 minutes before serving.",
        "You want to let the juices redistribute after the steak has cooked, so allow the steak to rest at room temperature for 5 minutes before you cut into it.",
        "Serve and enjoy your dry aged steak!",
        "Serve your steak with a side of steamed or grilled veggies.",
        "Having a healthy side made from fresh veggies will help you create a balanced and delicious meal.",
        "Try serving steamed broccoli, grilled zucchini, or whole ears of corn that have been roasted on the grill.",
        "Choosing the Perfect Steak Look for the \u201cUSDA Prime\u201d label.",
        "The USDA grades its beef based on tenderness, juiciness, and fat marbling.",
        "The ratings are Prime, Choice, and Select, with Prime being the highest quality.",
        "When it comes to dry aging, you want to start out with the best, so if you can afford it, choose a USDA Prime steak.",
        "If you can't, a Choice cut will be fine, but a Select cut may not have the marbling to support dry aging.",
        "Choose a high-quality cut of steak.",
        "Dry aging creates tenderness and flavor, but it won\u2019t cover up a poor cut of meat.",
        "Look for ribeyes, T-bones, porterhouses, or New York strips when you\u2019re shopping for a dry aged steak.",
        "Check to make sure your steak has abundant marbling.",
        "Marbling is the fat that\u2019s located within your steak, rather than along the outside edge.",
        "When you cook your steak, this fat will melt and create a rich flavor in the meat.",
        "Choose a steak that has been aged 3-6 weeks.",
        "When steaks are dry aged, they take on a unique flavor that has a little bit of funk to it, similar to a good bleu cheese.",
        "The longer it ages, the more pronounced this flavor will be.",
        "Steaks are dry-aged a minimum of 3 weeks, but they can be aged up to several months.",
        "If you\u2019re trying dry aged steak for the first time, aim for one that\u2019s been aged for about 3-6 weeks."
