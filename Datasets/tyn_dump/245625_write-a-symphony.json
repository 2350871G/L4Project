                    "description": "Symphonies are traditionally composed of four separate movements, which each have different forms. The first movement tends to be in Sonata form. The second movement is usually on the slower side and may be a set of variations. The third movement will generally be a Minuet or Scherzo and Trio. And the fourth movement is there to give the piece some closure and is often in rondo form. In your outline, list out everything you want to pin down about your symphony. This can include your inspiration, emotions, form, key and themes. List these out for each of your individual movements. Don\u2019t be afraid to make the form your own. If you want to create something different than the traditional four-movement symphony, do that. Sometimes composers swap the second and third movements. There have been three movement symphonies, usually omitting the minuet. There are five movement symphonies, often adding a March, or maybe another Scherzo or Minuet  between the third and last movement. There are some with more than five movements, taking inspiration from Beethoven's 9th; the best known of these including the Romeo et Juliette symphony by Berlioz and Mahler's Symphonies. Rarer still are some with only two movements. Often symphonies have had a thematic material that ties all of the movements together since the romantic era which may stay the same or vary as well. Think outside the box and have fun with it."

A medium size is when you can add a piccolo, English horn, bass clarinet, contra bassoon to the woodwinds and double the number of French horns and add 3 trombone plus a tuba to the brass as well as extra percussion instruments. If you can go larger, go for it. You don't however, have to stick with traditional instrumentation. If the instruments are available and there are players to play them, feel free to use other instruments in your symphony either adding them or using them like different colors (eg. replace one traditional instrument with one non-traditional one). For example, the inventor of the saxophone family designed his instruments for the orchestra (built in the keys of B\u266d and E\u266d) as well as the military band. You could also include an instrument that's been revived like one of the recorders, the viola da gamba or the oboe da caccia for example. Some symphonies also have vocal accompaniment. Try giving the same melodies to different instruments at different times to create a motif within the piece. Pay attention to layers and texture.
