Instead of using an all-purpose cleaner, you can use rubbing alcohol to clean the iron. This has the benefit of evaporating and not leaving a strong smell. Any general purpose cleaner will also work, although a cleaner with a strong smell could linger and eventually the smell could be transferred to your hair when you use the curling iron again. You can also make your own cleaning solution. Simply add one part baking soda to two parts water. This mixture can be used just like a commercial cleaner. The baking soda serves as a gentle abrasive that is good at cleaning off hairspray. A small brush that is easy to find is an old toothbrush. However, make sure that the toothbrush is very clean, and that no toothpaste residue is still on it."

Hairspray that has been on the iron for weeks or months will be harder to get off than hairspray that is fresh. Make sure to lift the clasp that closes on your hair when in use and clean under there as well! This is a spot that can get particularly gummed up with hairspray. Clean the handle and the cord too. Hairspray can sometimes get stuck on the handle area of the curling iron. This should be cleaned off so you don't have to touch sticky hairspray every time you pick up your iron. If the handle of the curling iron has vents, be careful not to get water or cleaner in them. These vents allow air to circulate into the electronics inside the curling iron. These electronics may be damaged if exposed to too much moisture."
