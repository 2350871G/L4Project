Try to keep the webbing as flat as possible while you\u2019re inserting it so it doesn\u2019t twist or snag. Pull the hanger out from the webbing so you have a closed loop. Push down on the webbing where you can feel the cut end inside with your nondominant hand. Carefully guide the wire straight from the opening so it doesn\u2019t pull the webbing out. After you remove the wire, pinch the opening closed so it\u2019s less likely to slide out. Securing and Using the Knot Reposition the knot so it\u2019s 3 in (7.6 cm) from the exposed end of webbing. Grab the looped section of the overhand knot with your dominant hand. Guide the knot toward the section of webbing that you inserted into the other so it\u2019s 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the visible end. Pull the webbing on the other side of the knot in the opposite direction until you don\u2019t feel any more slack. If you pull the looped section of the knot and it gets tighter, try guiding it in the opposite direction so it gets looser. Avoid twisting or tangling the webbing while repositioning the knot since it can affect the sling\u2019s strength. Tighten the knot to secure the ends.

Yank on each side of the knot to ensure the knot doesn\u2019t come undone. If you try to tighten the knot and it comes undone, then you will need to reinsert the cut end. Loop the sling around rocks while climbing to use as a safety harness. Make sure there aren\u2019t any sharp edges or points on the rock since they could slice the tubing. Position the sling so it loops around the widest and sturdiest portion of the rock so it can support your weight. Attach carabiners to the sling so you can clip onto it and use it for support.
