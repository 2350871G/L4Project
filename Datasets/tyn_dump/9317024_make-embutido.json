Place all of the ingredients, except for the hard-boiled eggs and the Vienna sausages, into a large mixing bowl. Fold the ingredients together using a wooden spoon or a rubber spatula. You can use any type of liquid seasoning you want. Teriyaki or Worcestershire sauce are great choices. The mixture needs to be sticky. If it is too dry, add up to \u00bc cup (60 milliliters) of milk. Spread a quarter to half of the mixture onto a piece of aluminum foil. Tear off a 10 by 12-inch (25 by 30-cm) piece of aluminum foil. Use a rubber spatula to spread a quarter to half of the mixture down the center of the foil piece in a rectangle shape. Place the egg and sausages down the center of the rectangle. If you have not already, hard-boil three eggs using your preferred method. Peel them, then cut them into quarters. Alternate the eggs and sausages down the center of the rectangle. Use half of the eggs and sausages if you will be making two embutido logs. Use a quarter of the eggs and sausages if you will be making four embutido logs. Use the foil to roll the mixture around the eggs and sausages. You can do this by holding the foil in your hand, and rolling it until the mixture wraps around the eggs and sausages. You can also hold the foil by the ends, then roll the mixture back and forth until it covers the eggs and sausages. Roll the foil into a tight log. Plan on making the log about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) thick. Twist the ends of the aluminum foil to help seal the mixture inside. Repeat the process to make one to three more logs. Once you have the first log done, repeat the process to make the rest. Spread some mixture onto a sheet of aluminum foil, roll it, then wrap it. If you run out of eggs and sausages, simply boil more eggs and cut more sausages. Cooking and Serving the Embutido Prepare your steamer or preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). If you are using a steamer, fill the pot with water, then insert the steamer basket, making sure that the bottom doesn't touch the water. If you are using an oven, set a wire rack into a baking pan filled with 2 inches (5.1 cm) of water. Place the embutido into the steamer or baking pan. If you are using a steamer, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. If you are using a baking pan, cover the pan with aluminum foil in order to trap the steam. Be sure to leave some space between each log, otherwise they will not cook properly. Steam or bake the embutido for 1 hour. If you are using an oven, make sure that you place the baking pan onto the center rack. The embutido are ready when you prick them with a fork and the juices run clear. Allow the embutido to cool for 8 to 10 minutes before unwrapping them. Once they are unwrapped, you can serve them, let them cool down to room temperature, or even chill them in the fridge. If you don't plan on serving the embutido right away, keep them wrapped in foil and put them into the fridge or freezer. Fry the embutido in oil, if desired. Fill a pan with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of oil.
