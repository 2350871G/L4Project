        "To make your rides more interesting, you can set up obstacles for your horse.",
        "For example, you might navigate your horse around barrels set up in the arena.",
        "Preparing Your Horse for a Winter Ride Warm up your horse\u2019s bit before you tack up for your ride.",
        "Take the bit out of the bridle and hold it under a stream of hot water.",
        "Remove it from the water once it feels warm to the touch.",
        "Then, put it back in the bridle and tack up.",
        "If you can, keep your horse\u2019s bit in your home during the winter.",
        "As another option, you can rub non-toxic hand warmer onto the bit or place the bit in your pocket against your skin.",
        "Cover your horse\u2019s back with a waterproof wool or fleece quarter sheet.",
        "Your quarter sheet will go either between the saddle pad and saddle or over the saddle, depending on the type you have.",
        "This will keep your horse\u2019s back and hindquarters warm and dry.",
        "If your horse gets wet, it will become very cold because the wetness will freeze.",
        "Put on hoof boots to protect the hooves from the icy ground, if you have them.",
        "Choose boots that are made of neoprene or PVC, which protect your horse from moisture.",
        "Don\u2019t use fabric boots, as the wetness from ice and snow will soak into them and then freeze.",
        "As an alternative, you can put pads beneath the hooves for added protection.",
        "If you don\u2019t have boots or pads, apply a thin layer of nonstick cooking spray or petroleum jelly to your horse\u2019s hooves to repel ice buildup.",
        "However, keep in mind that this won't protect your horse as well as boots and pads will.",
        "Handling Your Horse in Winter Conditions Allow your horse to warm up slowly.",
        "Walk it around for a few minutes before you mount.",
        "Then, start your trail at a very slow pace.",
        "This lets its muscles warm up before your horse starts working hard.",
        "To speed up the process, put on gloves and vigorously rub your horse\u2019s legs and back before you tack up.",
        "Shorten the length of your rides, since your horse is working harder.",
        "Cold weather makes your horse expend more energy, especially if it\u2019s walking through snow or mud.",
        "That means it will tire out more quickly, so don\u2019t ride for as long as you usually do.",
        "Use your best judgement when deciding how long to ride.",
        "It\u2019s best to stay close to the stables so you can stop if you notice your horse panting or huffing.",
        "Avoid brushing against snow-covered vegetation, which may cause chill.",
        "Snow can transfer from bushes, trees, shrubs, and other foliage onto your horse as you\u2019re traveling past it.",
        "This can cause your horse to develop a chill.",
        "Steer clear of these types of obstacles during your ride.",
        "This will also help you stay warm!",
        "Another good reason to avoid brushing snowy branches is that the falling snow might spook your horse.",
        "Go slowly so your horse sweats less, which limits the risk of chill.",
        "Even though it\u2019s cold, your horse may sweat during your ride because it\u2019s getting a lot of exercise.",
        "Unfortunately, this sweat can start to freeze, which may make your horse feel a chill.",
        "Slowing your pace can reduce how hard your horse is working, making it sweat less.",
        "Blanketing your horse can also help you prevent chill, even if your horse is sweating.",
        "Watch your horse for tiredness, as walking in winter requires more effort.",
        "Notice if your horse is panting, huffing, or struggling to get through the terrain.",
        "Even a fit horse will tire out more quickly during a winter ride.",
        "Don\u2019t overwork your horse.",
        "It\u2019s dangerous for both you and your horse if you push it too hard during a ride.",
        "You don\u2019t want to get stranded out on a trail.",
        "Tending to Your Horse After a Ride Cool down your horse for 10-15 minutes after your ride.",
        "Your horse still needs to cool down after a workout.",
        "Start the cool down by walking your horse slowly over the last few minutes of your ride.",
        "Then, dismount and loosen the girth without removing it, which would allow the cold air to chill the horse too quickly.",
        "Next, switch out the saddle for a wool or fleece breathable sheet or cooler, which will wick away the wetness and warm the horse.",
        "Wetness on your horse\u2019s coat will chill your horse, even after it\u2019s back in its stable.",
        "Use a hoof pick to remove ice and mud from the hooves, if necessary.",
        "Knock any built-up ice or mud off of your horse\u2019s hooves.",
        "Then, use the end of the pick to gently clean out any crevices, such as around the horse\u2019s shoes.",
        "Ice and mud that remain on the hooves can make it harder for your horse to walk.",
        "They can also undermine your horse\u2019s health by increasing your horse\u2019s risk of developing an infection.",
        "Brush your horse to remove ice, dirt, and mud from the coat.",
        "This also helps prevent dirt and debris from building up on the horse\u2019s skin.",
        "As your brush your horse, check for wetness so you can dry off your horse if necessary.",
        "You don\u2019t want it to catch a chill.",
        "Put warm, breathable blankets made from wool or fleece on your horse to keep it warm as you groom it.",
        "You might also apply leg wraps.",
        "Give your horse water heated to 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C) to replenish lost fluids.",
        "Your horse may easily get dehydrated during the winter.",
        "It will still be working hard, plus it may be less likely to drink if the water freezes.",
        "Using a water heater will encourage your horse to drink.",
        "Warming the water also lowers the amount of calories your horse needs to eat.",
        "That\u2019s because your horse\u2019s body will need to warm up cold water to its body temperature, which takes energy.",
        "If you give your horse warm water, its body won\u2019t have to warm it.",
        "Provide your horse with fresh hay to meet its higher energy needs.",
        "Hay is the best feed for your horse.",
        "Feed it at least as much as you typically feed it during warmer months.",
        "However, you may need to provide additional hay to meet your horse\u2019s winter needs.",
        "Ask your equine vet for advice on how much extra hay your horse needs during winter.",
        "You can also provide grain-mix supplementation if you normally do.",
        "Ask your vet if your horse needs grains."
