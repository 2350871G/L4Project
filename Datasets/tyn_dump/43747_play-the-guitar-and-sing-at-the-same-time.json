    "text": " Using a Metronome Learn how to play guitar. You can start with basic chords, or find a song and look up the tabs. Find something you think you can sing to. Learn the words of the song. Practice your singing technique. Learn how to play while tapping your pinky in 4/4 time. 4/4 time is simply four quarter notes in one measure, and is what most contemporary music is composed in. If you don't know how to count 4/4 time. A metronome can help you to keep time and is available inexpensively at most music stores. There are also many online metronomes that are free. Begin subdividing while playing. Start counting out loud, \"1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and\" while playing. Make sure you say the \"and\" after every number. In 4/4 time, this is the eighth note. It should come exactly halfway between each number. It helps in the beginning to strum your guitar every time you say a beat and an off-beat, which is when you are saying \"and\". Once you feel comfortable enough with the rhythm, no longer count aloud, just tap along.  Start adding in words.  Don't be discouraged at first. Remember that sometimes guitarists go months to years without keeping a steady tempo; using a metronome will help a lot. Playing Along with a Record Pick a cool song. Learn how to play it and sing it seperately. Play the song with the record and hum the lyrics.  Keep practicing the song until you can play it without the record and with your eyes closed. Your brain uses alpha waves and beta waves (conscious/sub-conscious). You use alpha waves when you concentrate and focus on something and use beta waves when you can just \"do it\" without \"thinking about it\". Once you have the song down to this point, you're ready for the final step. Play the song without focusing on the exact timing or shape of the chords. Try and play the chord progression while focusing on something else, to build the muscle memory in your mind. Now sing the song and let the playing fall to the background. Your conscious will be concentrating on the singing, but your sub-conscious will be playing the song. Finally, you will be able, with practice, to change roles back and forth. You will be able to seamlessly to switch between focusing on what you are playing and what you are singing. It is quite rare for guitar solos and singing parts to occur at the same time. That is by design, so don't try to change that when you go to write a song. Practice this and have fun!  Training Your Brain to Multitask Once you have the basics of guitar playing, try to come up with a few runs or chord progressions. Alternatively, use them from other songs if you're only going to play covers. Practice these until you can play them easily.  Now sit in front of the TV and watch it whilst playing them. It's important not to stop playing After a while, you should notice that you are playing fine but also managing to follow what's going on on TV. This is the first step in developing independence. Next, try reading something whilst playing. Try reading off a computer screen if you can't hold a book open. This will keep your mind more active than watching TV and playing. Try reading out loud in a droning voice. A common problem is only being able to sing the notes you're playing. This lets you learn how to sing off-beat and with harmony to your guitar. Keep doing this and eventually you should be able to sing and play almost completely different things.  Learning the Lyrics First Pick a song you want to play and learn the lyrics.  Play the recording of the song back to you and sing along. If you want, you may hum or sing it in your head, just so that you can get the song in your head. Repeat until you have mastered the song and you can play the song back in your head. Pick up the guitar and play along with the recording, but only guitar.  Once you master the song and you can play it without looking, start humming, or singing out loud while playing.  Associating Chords with Words Try to play chords that fit into a simple chord progression. For example, playing an E chord to a D chord to a G chord. Next, think of a word to use as your \"sample word\". Use a sample word for each of your chords. Take for example, if the sample word for E were game, then play E, but say game at the same time. If the sample word for D was free, then play D at the same time as free was being said. Try to make your words rhyme because it will train you to distinguish word from word when playing. Use this method with an actual song. This method is useful because it trains you to give each word a note, and this eventually leads to word-guitar-sync. Playing While Reading Once you are fine with playing the song just try playing while reading a book.  Practice until you are able to read the book. Once you are able to do this, read aloud in any particular rhythm of your choice. Once you are able to do this, singing songs will be easy. ",
