Many plastics can withstand boiling temperatures; but you shouldn\u2019t keep plastic bottles in hot water baths that are over 140 \u00b0F (60 \u00b0C) for extended periods of time.

If you\u2019re trying to soften smaller amounts of honey, scoop out your desired amount into a small glass bowl. Place your small bowl into a larger bowl that\u2019s filled with warm water to begin softening the honey. Stir the honey over several minutes, and refill the larger bowl with warm water as needed. Tip: If you don\u2019t want to worry about your water cooling down, try using a slow cooker! Fill your crock pot with enough water to submerge 75% of your honey jar. Next, turn on the device to the lowest possible heat setting, then leave your container of honey uncovered in the slow cooker for up to 8 hours. Make sure that the crock pot doesn\u2019t get any hotter than 140 \u00b0F (60 \u00b0C), or you\u2019ll overheat the honey. Ideally, try and keep the temperature under 120 \u00b0F (49 \u00b0C)."
