        "You can multiply how many flowers you have by taking apart an artificial bouquet and creating stems for each flower.",
        "It is easier to buy artificial flowers that already have stems attached.",
        "Arrange the flowers.",
        "Place single flower heads or bundles of flowers around the wreath to form the design.",

        "Then, move on to the lilies.",
        "Attach the flowers.",
        "You can insert the flower stems directly into the foam base.",
        "Or, you can glue the flowers to the base.",

        "Attach a hanger.",
        "You can make your own hanger by cutting off the top of a wire clothes hanger, gluing it on the back of the wreath, and hanging it on a nail.",
