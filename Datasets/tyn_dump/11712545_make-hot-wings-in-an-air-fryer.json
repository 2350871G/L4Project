    "text": " Preparing the Wings Bend the wing tip until the joint is forced apart. Using a sharp knife, cut the tip of the wing off. If a wing piece is larger than the size of your palm, proceed to cut them into two pieces and thoroughly wash the meat. After washing the meat, place it onto a strainer or colander to let excess water out for about 3-5 minutes. Transfer the wings from the strainer/colander to a large bowl and begin marinating by adding 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of olive oil. Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt, black pepper, 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of paprika, 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of cayenne pepper, 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon of onion powder. Mix together all the ingredients as evenly as possible. Every wing piece should seem like it is coated. Allow the meat to marinate for an hour or two. Air Frying Place parchment paper onto the air fryer basket. Parchment paper requires less cleaning because all the juice goes straight onto the paper instead of the basket. Set the air fryer to 360 degrees for 12 minutes. Place the marinated wings on the parchment paper and make sure the wings are not placed on top of one another. Laying it out as evenly as possible on one level will result in each piece being cooked evenly. Pull the basket out from the air fryer. After the 12 minutes is up, take the basket out of the air fryer and using a tong, flip each piece over. Place the basket into the air fryer and restart the timer for another 12 minutes. Making the Sauce Start on the sauce mixture while the wings are cooking. In a pan with medium to high heat, add in the stick of butter. After letting the butter melt for about 30-45 seconds, switch the heat to a low-medium power to make sure the butter does not burn. Mix together the seasoning for the sauce. In a separate bowl, add 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of minced garlic, 1/2 teaspoon chili flakes, and 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Mix well. Place the seasoning mix into the pan with the butter. Add in 1/2 cup of hot sauce and mix once again to make sure there are no chunks of butter. Switch back to medium to high heat and stir using a whisk. This will make sure the hot sauce and butter seasoning mix is combined. Add in a bit more of salt and pepper (optional). Transfer the sauce mixture onto a separate bowl. Pull the wings out and dip each one in the hot sauce mixture. Once the final 12 minutes have passed, you can take the wings out of the fryer and cover with sauce. Brushing the wings can work, however, to get that spicy flavor deep in the wings, dipping the wings into the mixture a couple of times is effective. Place the hot sauce covered wings back into the basket. Set the timer for another 3 minutes to just ensure that the wings are coated and covered in sauce that sticks. Transfer onto a plate & enjoy with a side of ranch or blue cheese. ",
