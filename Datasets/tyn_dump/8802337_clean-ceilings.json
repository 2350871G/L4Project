Depending on the type of vacuum you have, you may be able to vacuum a substantial amount of debris before doing anything else. Use a bristle-brush attachment or another attachment intended for easily-scratched surfaces. Extend the telescoping shaft of your vacuum, if you have one.

A microfiber attachment on your duster will pick up more dust and is less likely to scratch your ceiling."
