All you need to do is add detergent to the water drawn into the washing machine, then let the clothes soak for 20-30 minutes in the mix of detergent and standing water. It will be easier to soak clothes in a top-loading washing machine than in a side-loading machine. Check your side-loading machine for an integrated pre-soak function. Pre-soaking in the machine can be convenient because you won't need to transfer the fabric after the soak. However, you don't need to soak in the washing machine if you plan to hand-wash your clothes."
