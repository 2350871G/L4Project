Otherwise, it will float. The same relationship will be true for other liquids. For example, when you try to mix olive oil and water, the oil will rise to the top since it is less dense than water. Specific gravity is another ratio that relates to density. Often it is the density of an object divided by the density of water (or another substance). The units cancel each other out, so you are just left with a number that represents relative masses. The number is often used in chemistry to determine concentrations of a substance in a solution."
