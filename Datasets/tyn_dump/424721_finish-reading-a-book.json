By using a bookmark, you won't only be certain of your place in the book, but it will also serve as a psyching mechanism, showing you that you've already reached that far in reading it, so why not keep going."

Indeed, Benjamin Franklin taught himself good comprehension and writing structure by reorganizing the writings he read in the Spectator when he didn't understand them, scrambling the notes and making himself look at the scrambles of original writing weeks later to recreate the essay. Distractions such as too many thoughts whirling about, noise around you, people making demands of you, and feeling unwell can all make for hard comprehension when reading. Find quiet times without such distractions and you'll take in the information much better."

Early evening and night would be a more suitable time for general reading. If you must read more technical information for studies or work, try to leave the harder elements for morning reading when you're most refreshed, and the lighter aspects or revising for evenings. It may well be worth getting up earlier for! Try to schedule a set time each day to return to the book. If this isn't possible, schedule set times per week.
