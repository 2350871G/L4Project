Anything larger will require extra postage, which you can add up using a postage calculator. As of January 2018, the cost of a single Forever stamp is $0.50. Forever stamps are useful for mailing letters, greeting cards, and paper items weighing less than 1 ounce (28 g). To send a standard commercial envelope somewhere outside the United States, you\u2019ll need to use a Global Forever stamp. At this time, Global Forever stamps cost $1.15 apiece."

Items sent Ground mail (sometimes referred to as \u201cstandard shipping\u201d) typically arrive within 2-8 business days. Ground is most useful for sending large quantities of mail at once, handling oversized packages, and saving money on things that aren't urgent. With Priority Mail, delivery is guaranteed within 1-3 days. To make sending large items more affordable, you have the option of mailing them in a flat rate envelope or box, which costs a fixed rate regardless of weight (up to 70 pounds (32 kg)). First Class mail also usually goes out in 1-3 days, but items are limited to 13 ounces (370 g) in weight. Heavier items will require additional postage."
