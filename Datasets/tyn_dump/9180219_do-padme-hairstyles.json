    "text": " Doing Padme's Celebration Buns Brush out your hair. This method will show you how to make the mini buns that Padme wore during the celebration at the end of The Phantom Menace. Your hair should fall past your collarbone and shoulders in order for this to work. If you have curly or wavy hair, use a straightening iron to smooth out your hair and fit the look. Choose a necklace to use as the headpiece. In the movie, Padme wears a circlet in her hair that droops down across her forehead. Find a silver necklace with a crystal or pendant that looks similar to the one in the movie. Make sure that the necklace is closed. Choose a necklace with a smaller chain. It needs to sit on top of your head, like a crown, with the pendant falling over your forehead. A smaller necklace would work best. You can also use an actual hair circlet instead, but the necklace may be more comfortable to wear. Gather and clip a U-shaped section of hair from the top of your head. The section should span the width of your forehead, and extend towards your crown in a curved U-shape. Twist the section into a temporary bun, and secure it with a clip. For best results, use the handle of a rat-tail comb to separate the hair. How far back you extend the section depends on the length of your necklace. You want the necklace to droop past your hairline, with the pendant over your forehead. Place the necklace over your head. Nestle the chain around the back and side edges of the gathered hair. Let the pendant fall forward, past your hairline and across your forehead. Make sure that the clasp of the necklace is on the back of your head, out of sight. If the chain is too long, take the necklace off and re-gather the hair at the back of your head, this time extending it further back. Your hair will hold the necklace in place. You do not need to pin the necklace. Gather all of your hair into mid-high ponytail. Use your hands to smooth all of your hair, including the hair on the top of your head, back into a ponytail. Secure the ponytail with a hair tie that matches your hair color. Make sure that your hair covers the necklace's chain. The only part of the chain that should be visible is the part that is sticking out of your hairline at the front. Take a thin section of hair from the top of the ponytail and tie it into a looped bun. Gather about a fifth of the ponytail, and begin to tie it into a mini ponytail with a clear hair elastic. On the second-to-last wrap, pull the ponytail only partway through the elastic. Wrap the elastic two more times around the looped bun. Keep the looped bun small\u2014no taller than your pinkie. You will have a long tail of hair sticking out from under the bun. Make sure it is pointing downward. You will be splitting the hair in your ponytail into five buns, so plan accordingly. Create four more mini buns, two on each side. Make sure that you are pulling the same amount of hair into each bun. Have all of the tails pointing towards the middle of the ponytail. This means that the two left buns should be pointing to the right, and the two right buns should be pointing to the left. Twist the tails into thin ropes, then coil and pin them. Pluck out a tail from one of the buns. Twist it into a tight, thin rope. coil it into a random, abstract shape between the buns, and secure it with a bobby pin. Repeat this step for the other tails. Make sure that you use bobby pins that match your hair color. Spread the buns apart to form fan shapes. Gently pull on the side edge of your first bun until it flattens and turns into a fan. If you need to, lightly mist the bun with hairspray first. Repeat this step for the other buns. The final look will create a segmented halo. The side buns should be parallel to each other on the side of your head, and the top fan should be perpendicular to the buns. Set the style with hairspray. Once the hairspray dries, you are good to go. If this is for a costume and you did not put on your makeup yet, now is the time to do so. You will need to lift the pendant up and out of the way while applying your foundation and powder, however. Doing Padme's Gladiator Ring Updo Brush out your hair. T is the hairstyle Padme wore in the Gladiator Ring during Attack of the Clones. It will look a little like a funnel cake. Your hair should fall at least pat your shoulder for this to work, although longer will be better. Gather your hair into a mid-high pony on the back of your head. Tie the ponytail off with a hair tie that matches your hair color. Make sure that the hair going into the ponytail is nice and smooth, with no bumps. Use a hairbrush while making the ponytail, if necessary. Twist a thin section of hair from the ponytail into a rope. Take a \u00bd-inch (1.27-centimeter) thick section of hair from the ponytail. Twist it into a tight rope. Apply pomade to the hair as you twist it to help keep it smooth. Pin the end of the rope to a random spot on the outside of the hair tie. Hold the rope in such a way that it remains twisted. Pull it over to a random spot on the outer edge of the hair tie, and secure it with a bobby pin that matches your hair color.
