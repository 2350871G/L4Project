Be sure to do this no later than ten minutes after the paint was applied, so the chips can stick to the wet coat. Always toss the chips upward, rather than directly at the floor. This will help to disperse over a wider area, instead of in clumps. Before you begin painting, do a test run with your chips once your primer has dried. Be sure that you have have enough to cover the entire floor. Also, practice your tosses so you don't end up using all your flakes before the end due to poor dispersal.

If you do a second coat, be aware that many experts recommend applying second coats in a perpendicular fashion to the first. For example, if you rolled from the back of the garage toward the door, you should then roll from one side of the garage to the other during the second coat. However, the confines of your garage might not allow you to do this so easily. In this case, just apply the second coat in the same exact fashion as the first.

        "Choose a corner to be your starting point.",
        "Use a brush to paint a strip roughly 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 cm) wide along the edges of the floor.",
        "Paint the floor strip by strip.",
        "Again, simply use the same process as priming.",
        "Fill your paint tray with paint.",
        "Using a roller with an extension pole, paint the floor on strip at a time.",
        "Starting in a back corner, cover the freshly painted border with a length of paint roughly 4 feet (1 m) long by 2 feet wide (1.2 m long by 0.6 m wide).",
        "Freshen your roller with more paint and paint another strip that slightly overlaps the first.",
        "As before, start at the back of the garage and work from side to side before moving backward toward the garage door.",
        "Add color flakes if you like.",
        "Consider adding vinyl chips to liven up the floor's base coat with complement colors.",
        "If you decide to do so, empty the chips from their packaging into a bucket or similar container before you start painting.",
        "Keep the bucket handy as you paint.",
        "Once you have a sizable area covered, toss handfuls of chips into the air over it so they can settle at random into the drying paint.",
        "Be sure to do this no later than ten minutes after the paint was applied, so the chips can stick to the wet coat.",
        "Always toss the chips upward, rather than directly at the floor.",
        "This will help to disperse over a wider area, instead of in clumps.",
        "Before you begin painting, do a test run with your chips once your primer has dried.",
        "Be sure that you have have enough to cover the entire floor.",
        "Also, practice your tosses so you don't end up using all your flakes before the end due to poor dispersal.",
        "If you plan on doing a second coat of paint, wait until then before applying your flakes.",
        "If flakes are added, then you\u2019ll need to apply a sealer to the floor.",
        "This will prevent the flakes from coming loose.",
        "Apply a second coat if desired.",
        "Give the first coat 24 hours to dry.",
        "After that, give it a gander and determine whether you want to apply a second coat.",
        "If you do, simply repeat the process.",
        "If not, feel free to begin walking over the first coat as long as it no longer feels tacky, but give it another week before parking your car or other heavy machinery inside.",
        "If you do a second coat, be aware that many experts recommend applying second coats in a perpendicular fashion to the first.",
        "For example, if you rolled from the back of the garage toward the door, you should then roll from one side of the garage to the other during the second coat.",
        "However, the confines of your garage might not allow you to do this so easily.",
        "In this case, just apply the second coat in the same exact fashion as the first.",
        "Keep in mind that a second coat of paint will take much longer to dry than the first coat."
