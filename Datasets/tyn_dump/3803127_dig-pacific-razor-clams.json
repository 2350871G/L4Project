Facing the Ocean, place the clam gun directly over the clam show. Quickly remove it to ensure that you are indeed centered over the clam show. Slant the clam gun so that the handle is tilted just slightly toward the dunes.  Work the clam gun in a twisting motion to assist in plunging the gun into the sand.  Push the gun into the sand.
