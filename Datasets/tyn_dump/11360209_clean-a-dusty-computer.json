        "Be aware that some cans of air have a button on top to release the air, rather than a trigger.",

        "Wipe down caked-on dust with a damp cloth.",
        "If the dry cloth wipe-down didn\u2019t capture all of the dust in your computer, you can always go over it one more time with the wet cloth to give your computer\u2019s hardware a satisfying, clean-looking shine.",

        "Then you can just use another sanitizing wipe or wet paper towel to clean out the area beneath the keys.",
