Continue cutting \"X\" patterns into the onion by turning the onion 90 degrees, then cut another \"X\" shape. Keep doing this until you cut at least 10-14 times across the onion. Remember to leave the bottom of the onion intact, otherwise the flower will be destroyed. After cutting the \"X\" patterns into the top of the onion cut out or pull out the center of the onion."
