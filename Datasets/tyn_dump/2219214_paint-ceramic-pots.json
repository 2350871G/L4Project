    "text": " Paint Glazed Ceramic Pots Use a hose or your kitchen faucet to rinse your ceramic pot inside and out.  Scrub it with detergent and water using a scrub brush or abrasive pad. You can also use an old toothbrush to clean underneath the lip of the pot. Rinse the pot well inside and out.  Set the pot in the sun and allow it to dry thoroughly.  Purchase glossy interior/exterior spray paint, 200-grit sandpaper, paintbrushes and a can of latex primer.  Put the pot outside on a table, preferably on a day that is not windy or rainy. Put a piece of cardboard, plastic sheeting or some newspapers on the table to protect it from the paint. Sand the pot with sandpaper just enough to roughen up the glossy surface.  Wipe the pot down with a clean, damp cloth.  Apply the primer with a brush, and let it dry thoroughly. Latex primer adheres well to roughed-up ceramic. You can apply a second coat of primer to make sure you have perfect coverage. Let all coats dry completely. Read the directions on the can before you begin painting. You usually need to shake the can vigorously first. Spray the interior of the pot, using even, sweeping strokes.  Allow the inside paint to dry thoroughly. (If you don\u2019t want to apply color to the inside, turn the pot upside down and proceed with the next step.) Spray the exterior of the pot. Use sweeping motions so that the color goes on evenly. Allow the pot to dry in the sun.  Save any leftover paint in case you need to do touch-ups.  Wait at least 24 hours after painting before you repot your plant.  Paint Unglazed Ceramic Pots Purchase unglazed ceramic pots at a craft store. These stores also carry a variety of paints, water sealers, finish glosses and brushes that are suitable for painting unglazed pots. Choose a work area that is well-ventilated.  Cover your work surface with plastic or newspapers to protect it.  Remove seams on the pot that were created from the mold. Use a chisel to gently chip the seams off or sand them lightly with fine to medium grade sandpaper. This step is necessary for a smooth surface, and the paint will adhere better if you lightly sand it first. Brush the pot off with a soft paint brush or a dry cloth. You can also blow off any dust and dirt with a hair dryer. Wipe the pot down with a damp cloth.  Allow the pot to dry completely.  Spray the inside of your pot with a waterproof sealer. A sealer will help prevent moisture from soaking through the pot, which could ruin the outside finish. Let the sealer dry completely.  Apply a primer to the ceramic pot using a paintbrush. The primer helps the final coat of paint adhere and it covers any small imperfections or discolorations. Let the primer coat dry completely.  Brush a thin coat of acrylic paint on the entire pot. Use the best brush you can afford; the bristles on cheap brushes invariably come loose and get stuck in the paint. Allow the paint to dry.  Apply another thin coat of paint to the ceramic pot and let it dry.  Use a thin coat of acrylic gloss to protect the paint.  Allow at least 24 hours of drying time before you put soil in the pot. ",
