The whitening strip will still stick out above your teeth, so take care of it by carefully folding it back into your mouth. Wrap it over your teeth and press on it again to stick it in place. When you use a whitening strip, press it as tight as you can against your teeth. That way, the chemicals stay on your teeth instead of leaking into your mouth. If you're having trouble getting the strips to stick, dab your teeth with a clean cloth or paper towel to eliminate moisture. The gel on the strips is very sticky, so adhesion problems aren't too common, but there is a chance that saliva could get in the way."
