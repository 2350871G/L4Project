Notice if the plant branches only once or if it branches multiple times. Finally, record the answers to the following questions in your notebook:\nIs the stem visible? What is the shape and color of the stem? How do the branches attach to the trunk or stem? Are the branches arranged opposite each other or alternately on the stem?"

Notice if the flower has a disc in the center or not. Finally, note any special characteristics of the flower that you think will help you identify it. Answer the following questions in your notebook:\nWhat color and shape is the flower? How many petals does the flower have? Does the flower have male and female sex organs in each flower? Does the flower have sepals, which are a green leaf-like part that is visible beneath the flower?Tip: When identifying the sex parts of a flower, find the stamen (male part) by looking for a wand-like growth that holds pollen. There may be several stamens. Then, check for the pistil (female part) by looking in the center of the flower for a long tube with a bulb at the bottom."

Are the leaves opposite each other, alternating, or in a circular pattern? What shape and size is the leaf? Does the leaf have hairs? What color is the leaf on the front and back? What is the shape of the leaf\u2019s edge? Is it smooth, or does it have small \u201cteeth\u201d or big jagged \u201cteeth\u201d? How do the leaves attach to the stem?Tip: If you have a magnifying glass, use it to closely view the structure of the leaves.
