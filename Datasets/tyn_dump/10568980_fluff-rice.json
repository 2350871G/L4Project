Remove the pot of cooked rice from the heat and let it rest for 10 minutes or until it reaches your desired consistency.

A carving fork is an effective stirring utensil as it easily breaks up the grains of rice without mashing them together. This process gives the rice a fluffy consistency. Avoid using a spoon to mix the rice as this can make it mushy. Try not to stir the rice for longer than 1 minute as this can squish the grains."
