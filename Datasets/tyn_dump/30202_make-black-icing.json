You can still start with a white icing, but you will probably have to add flavoring later to cover the bitterness of the dye. You can dye most icing--including buttercream, cream cheese, or royal icing--black by following these instructions. Because royal icing is white, you may need to add flavoring or cocoa powder to hide the bitter flavor."

You will use less of the gel than you would the liquid coloring. If you cannot find black dye, mix equal parts red, blue, and green food coloring. You won't get the \"true\" black like you would from the store-bought black, but you can achieve a very dark gray that can pass for black."

Store-bought icing will probably be a fine consistency, as it is usually nice and thick. To thicken, thoroughly mix in some sifted powdered (aka confectioner's) sugar. If you don't want your icing any sweeter but it's not thick enough, add some meringue powder instead. If you are using royal icing, drag a butter knife through the surface. Count how long it takes the icing to smooth back over. If it's between 5-10 seconds, your icing is thick enough. Any faster and you need to mix it longer or add a little sifted powdered sugar or meringue powder."

The color will continue to deepen even once you've piped it onto a cookie or cake, so if you are super short on time you can go ahead and decorate immediately. Just be aware you won't have the opportunity to troubleshoot if the icing doesn't develop into the black you want.
