Establish the parameters of the court by either marking lines or using ready made boundaries like bushes or lines on the concrete. The game starts once the first player serves the ball, or throws the ball, at the wall. Ensure that the ball must bounces once before it reaches the wall. You may play with just 2 players or with multiple players at once. Decide the order of players to keep things organized. Depending on the size of the court and the variations of the rules, players must determine how far they are allowed to stand from the wall prior to the serve. For example, some rules indicate that everyone must stand back behind the throwing line prior to the first serve, in line with the server. Other rules state that only the thrower must stand behind the line. Do not choose a wall that you may damage or is close to items that you can damage like windows or cars. It also is ideal to find a wall where the ground has a slight decline towards the players."

If the thrower is out because she has fumbled the ball and someone has thrown her out before she has had a chance to reach the wall, play continues with the person who threw her out as the new person serving the ball. If a person who is not a thrower tries to field the ball but fumbles it, he must then try to reach the wall before someone throws him out.
