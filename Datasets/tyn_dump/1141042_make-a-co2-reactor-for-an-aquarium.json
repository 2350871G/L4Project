Pour 600 ml (20  fl oz) of water into the citric acid bottle. Measure out the water with a measuring cup and pour it into the bottle, using the funnel. The solution will look clear at the bottom of the bottle. If you are trying to generate more CO2 and you\u2019ve increased the amount of baking soda you\u2019re using, make sure to adjust the amount of citric acid that you\u2019re using accordingly. Always keep the citric acid to water ratio at 1:3. Shake both bottles to mix the solutions. Screw the caps on both bottles and shake them vigorously to mix the solutions and start the CO2 reaction. You should start to see the mixtures bubble in the bottles. Once they are mixed, remove the caps. Connecting Your System Purchase a CO2 generator kit at an aquarium or online. A CO2 generator kit will have plastic tubing connecting 2 caps and should include a pressure gauge and a valve. Sometimes, the tubing will be connected by a piece of hard plastic. The pressure gauge and valve will allow you to monitor and regulate how much CO2 is going into your tank. These kits will typically cost anywhere from $10-$25. Read the instructions that come with your specific kit. If you don\u2019t get a CO2 generator kit, you won\u2019t be able to accurately regulate the CO2 going into your tank, which could be dangerous for pets and vegetation. Screw the pressure gauge cap to the top of your citric acid bottle. Insert the tubing that\u2019s coming out of the cap into the bottle labeled with a B. Then, turn the cap clockwise until it\u2019s tight. Screw the cap with the valve attached onto the baking soda bottle. Turn the valve clockwise to close it before hooking up the bottles. Then, place the tube coming out the cap with the valve attached to the top into the baking soda bottle. Turn the cap clockwise to tighten it. Connecting the bottles together allows the citric acid to slowly flow into the baking soda bottle which will produce the chemical reaction that will generate CO2. Connect the end of the tubing to a bubble counter. A bubble counter is a small plastic piece that the CO2 diffuses through before going into your tank. Fill the bubble counter with water. Then, take the plastic tubing coming from your valve and insert the end into the bubble counter. A bubble counter will help you monitor how much CO2 is actually being generated by your system which will allow you to moderate how much CO2 you are using. Connect the bubble counter to additional tubing. Get tubing that\u2019s long enough so that it can reach the bottom of your tank. Take the tubing and connect it to the output valve on the bottom your bubble counter. Connect a diffuser to the end of the tubing. Purchase a diffuser at a pet store or online. Connect the end of the tubing to the diffuser. Your CO2 setup is complete. A diffuser will help break up larger bubbles and diffuse the CO2 into the water. Using and Maintaining the System Place the diffuser into the bottom of the tank. Bubbles should form in the bubble counter every couple of seconds. This is a sign that your system is working correctly. As the CO2 moves its way through the tubes you should see bubbles coming out of your diffuser. It may take 1-2 minutes for the CO2 bubbles reach your diffuser. Adjust the valve to increase or decrease the CO2 in the tank. Turn the valve clockwise to close the valve and reduce the amount of CO2 being generated. Turn it counterclockwise to open the valve to increase the amount of CO2. As a rule of thumb for most tank setups, this would equate to 10 bubbles per minute per 100 l (3,400  fl oz) of water.
