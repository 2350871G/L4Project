After spraying the boat, wait a few minutes for the water to dissolve harsh minerals. If you use your boat in saltwater, try to remove it from the water to spray it down completely about once per month. In most cases, you can clean the entire boat while it's still in the water. Avoid using a high-pressure nozzle, which can cause water to get into areas that are sealed off. A normal garden hose nozzle is fine for rinsing the boat. This is especially important for boats that are used in saltwater. The salt can be extremely corrosive and damage your boat if it isn't rinsed off regularly."
