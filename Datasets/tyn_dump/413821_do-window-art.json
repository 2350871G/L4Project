Make sure that you mix your paints with soap, NOT detergent. Detergent is caustic and will cause damage to your windows. Use a product such as Ivory concentrated dish washing liquid and hand soap or Meyer\u2019s liquid dish soap. Experiment with using different proportions of paint and dish soap. The more dish soap you use, the runnier the mixture will be. More soap also makes the cleanup easier, however. If you use powdered tempera paints, you will also need to add a little water to the mix.

Construction paper or other forms of heavy paper will block light coming through your window. You can create interesting effects with light and shadow by covering most of your window with the paper and cutting designs into the paper where you want the light to shine through. Choose colored tissue paper for a \u201cstained glass\u201d effect. Tissue paper is more translucent than regular paper or heavy cardstock. Light will shine through the tissue paper and create a beautiful glow. Look for colored tissue paper in an arts and crafts store, or get some gift wrap tissue paper from the greeting cards and gifts section in your grocery store or big box store. Draw your design on the paper of your choice. Use a pencil, pen or marker to sketch your design on the paper. If you\u2019d rather not draw freehand, you can use a stencil or even a cookie cutter to guide you. For example, if you\u2019d like to make some simple heart shapes, you can just place a heart-shaped cookie cutter on top of your paper and trace the outline. You can also download and print out paper cutout templates from the Internet. Lay the template on top of your paper and fix it in place with some tape or a glue stick and cut where indicated. Cut out your designs. Once you have your design laid out, use a pair of paper-cutting scissors to carefully cut out your shapes. If your design is delicate or has a lot of interior detail, you may need to use a sharp craft knife or utility knife. If you are a child, ask an adult to help you with any sharp cutting tools. Use tape or clear contact paper to fix your decorations to the window. Once your decorations are cut out, it\u2019s time to put them in place! The simplest approach is to tape the decorations in place with a little clear cellophane tape. You can also fix the decorations to the sticky side of a piece of clear contact paper cut to fit the window, then carefully apply the contact paper to the inside of your window. You can also stick the cutouts to the glass with double-sided tape. Place the decorations on the inside of your window. If you put paper decorations on an exterior window, they may quickly become rain damaged or fade in the sun.",
