Your pot should be 3\u20136 inches (7.6\u201315.2 cm) in diameter, with drainage holes in the bottom. Take an African Violet cutting from a host plant. Locate a healthy, mature leaf that is growing close to the base of an existing African violet. Cut off the leaf stem with a sharp, clean knife. A healthy host plant with have a green stem without brown patches. A mature leaf should be 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) in length. Look for a healthy green leaf.
