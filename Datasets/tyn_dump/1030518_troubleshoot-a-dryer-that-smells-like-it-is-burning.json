Removing the top panel will allow you to clean any lint that may have fallen beyond the lint trap. First you\u2019ll need to take out the screws located around the opening of the lint trap. Then pull the entire top panel towards you and lift it up to release the metal catches. If your dryer faces forward, the metal catches are typically located about 3 inches (7.6 cm) to 4 inches (10 cm) down from the top and up from the floor. You\u2019ll have to slide the panel upwards or downwards depending on how your dryer is assembled. If your dryer has a condenser unit that holds the lint trap, remove it from the dryer and rinse away any lint under the faucet of a large sink. Make sure to rinse both sides of the unit and let it air dry for a few hours before inserting it back into the dryer. You may need to wedge a screwdriver between the top or front panel and the base of the dryer to pry it open."

        "Replace the lint trap, the lint panel, and plug in the dryer to test it.",
        "After cleaning the most common places for lint to accumulate, replace all the parts and reconnect the dryer to the power source.",
        "If your dryer is gas-powered, reconnect the gas line and turn it on.",
        "Run the dryer for up to 1 or 2 minutes to see if the burning smell is gone.",
        "If there\u2019s no smell you can use your dryer as usual\u2014just remember to clean out the lint trap after each load.",
        "If the burning smell persists, there may be lint stuck around the parts inside of the dryer.",
        "Vacuuming the Inside of the Dryer Unplug the power cord and disconnect the gas, if applicable.",
        "You\u2019ll need to shut off the power and gas to stay safe before opening up the body of your dryer.",
        "If your dryer is gas-powered, turn the gas valve on the dryer line to the \u201coff\u201d position or turn off the valve supplying gas to your whole house.",
        "Then unscrew the flex hose to disconnect the dryer from the gas line and use a gas line cap to seal the line.",
        "Refer to the manual that came with your electric or gas dryer if you\u2019re not sure where to locate the power cord or gas line.",
        "Use a screwdriver to wedge open and remove the bottom panel.",
        "Insert a screwdriver into the gaps close to the where the catches are (usually at the top corners of the panel).",
        "You may need to slide the screwdriver to the left or right and wiggle it around until the catches release.",
        "Refer to your dryer\u2019s manual to see exactly where the catches are and if there are any additional instructions about how to remove the panel.",
        "If your dryer doesn\u2019t have a removable panel underneath where you load clothes, you may need to slide it away from the wall and remove the back panel.",
        "Use a vacuum\u2019s hose attachment to suck out any lint buildup.",
        "Sometimes lint can drop into the body of the dryer, coming in contact with the heating element and causing the lint to heat up (hence the burning smell).",
        "Use a vacuum attachment to clean out all the lint.Tip: Go slowly and be careful vacuuming around wires and small parts.",
        "Reattach both panels, replace the lint screen, and test the dryer.",
        "Reattach the bottom and top panels, sliding and pushing them into the correct position until you hear the catchers click into place.",
        "Then replace the screws on the lint trap opening before plugging in the dryer.",
        "Run it for about 1 or 2 minutes and if you still notice the burning smell, stop it immediately and unplug it again.",
        "If the smell persists, you may need to clean the hose duct or call a professional.",
        "Cleaning the Hose and Vent Unplug the power cord from the wall for safety purposes.",
        "Make sure there is no electrical current running to your dryer before you handle any parts of it.",
        "If your dryer is gas-powered, you should also turn off the gas.",
        "Turn the valve connecting your dryer to the gas line to the off position or shut off the main valve that supplies gas to your entire house.",
        "Unscrew the flex hose to disconnect the dryer from the gas line and use a gas line cap to seal the line until you\u2019re done cleaning the dryer.",
        "Failing to disconnect the power can result in moderate shocks to electrocution, so be sure to disconnect it!",
        "Slide the dryer away from the wall to access the exhaust hose.",
        "Slowly pull the dryer away from the wall so you can access the venting hose, the flexible tube connected to the back of your dryer.",
        "Depending on your model, the hose may look shiny and silvery or like white corrugated plastic.",
        "Use a screwdriver to unscrew the clamps that hold the hose in place.",
        "Loosen and unscrew the clamps that keep the hose attached to the dryer and the wall.",
        "Detach each end of the hose and pull out as much lint as you can with your hand.",
        "Use a vacuum with a long wand attachment to clean deeper into the tube.",
        "Clean out the hose every 6 months or so because lint buildup is a fire hazard.",
        "Look at both ends of the hose to check for any kinks\u2014these small depressions can reduce airflow and allow bits of lint to get into the central dryer cabinet.",
        "Dryer repair companies can also clean this for you if you don\u2019t want to do it yourself.",
        "Use a dryer vent cleaning brush to clean out lint from the vent.",
        "The vent is where the hose attaches to the wall.",
        "It\u2019s easy for lint to get trapped in the vent.",
        "Use a cleaning brush with a long stick attachment to pull out lint, making sure to clean as far into the vent as you can.",
        "Tip: Some dryer cleaning kits come with detachable scrub heads and 2 feet (0.61 m) long stick attachments.",
        "You can fit these together to make a 4 feet (1.2 m) or 6 feet (1.8 m) cleaning tool to go deeper into the vent if necessary.",
        "Inspecting Internal Parts Use a multimeter to see if you need a new thermostat.",
        "The thermostat monitors the internal temperature of the dryer and shuts it off if it gets too hot.",
        "If your thermostat is broken, the burning smell could be due to overheating.",
        "Unplug the machine, remove the back panel of the dryer, and remove the small cylindrical or rectangular-shaped thermostat by disconnecting the wires from both sides.",
        "Then set your multimeter to the lowest ohm reading (RX1) and place the two probes of the meter to the terminals (on one each, it doesn\u2019t matter which color probe goes on which side).",
        "The terminals are the two metal prongs on either side of the thermostat.",
        "Before disconnecting the thermostat wires, take a photo to keep track of which wires go where or jot it down on a notepad.",
        "At room temperature, the multimeter should have a reading of zero.",
        "If it reads infinity, get it replaced.",
        "Inspect the heating element in electrical dryers for signs of breakage or burning.",
        "The heating element looks like a coil (made of nickel and chrome) or series of interconnected coils housed inside a small open-faced box.",
        "Unplug the machine and remove the back panel in order to access it.",
        "Take it out by unscrewing the sensors located at the top and bottom of the vessel and unhooking the 2 wires located below the bottom screw.",
        "Be sure to inspect each coil.",
        "If you see any dark spots (blackening) or broken coils, call a repair service to replace the element.",
        "If two adjacent coils are touching (as if they\u2019ve been smashed together like a slinky), it could cause an electrical short and needs to be replaced.",
        "You can also use a multimeter to test for proper functioning.",
        "Set the multimeter to the continuity setting and press the probes onto the wire terminals (one on each terminal) located at the outside corner of the encasing.",
        "If the multimeter beeps, the element is still good.",
        "If it makes no sound, the element needs to be replaced.",
        "Inspect the wires attached to the heating element in a gas dryer.",
        "If you have a gas dryer, the heating element is located inside the electrical cabinet on the backside of the dryer.",
        "Look for a long white or silver cylindrical tube (the combustion tube) with two or three wires attached.",
        "If the wires or old or have come unattached, they may have partially melted and caused the burning smell.",
        "Note: If you see any signs of burning or melting on any of the wires, call a professional to have them replaced.",
        "Call a professional to replace the belt if you see physical slack or damage.",
        "The belt loops around the drum, under the pulley, and around the motor pulley.",
        "A worn out belt might loosen, causing slippage, friction, and heat (hence the burning smell).",
        "Unplug the dryer, slide it away from the wall, and remove the back panel to access the belt.",
        "It should be tightly wound around something that looks like a pulley system.",
        "In some models, the belt and motor pulley are located toward the front of the machine.",
        "If this is the case, remove the front panel in order to access and inspect the belt.",
        "Use your hand to tug on the belt, making sure it remains taught.",
        "If you notice any slack, parts that appear melted, or sections that have been rubbed away (revealing the internal fibers), call a professional to replace it.",
        "Be careful when inserting your hand into the body of the dryer, the edges of the cabinets and internal casings are sharp!",
        "Depending on the make and model of your dryer, the belt will be located either behind the back panel or behind the front bottom panel."
