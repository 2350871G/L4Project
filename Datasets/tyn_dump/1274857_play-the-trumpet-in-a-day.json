It may come from a nameless brand, but that's fine for starters. Make sure it's a \"B flat major\" trumpet, the most common kind and therefore, easiest to learn. While you're at the music store, you might also want to invest in a beginner's method book. Those books normally come with accompaniment CDs, and also include scales, techniques for playing, and many beginner's pieces. Don't immediately open up the case and start noodling around.

Take out your mouthpiece and buzz into there. Do this every time you practice, as it gets you ready for playing and also improves your tone quality. Insert the mouthpiece into the trumpet. Buzz into the mouthpiece again, but don't press any of the valves yet. Do that for a little while until you have the buzzing technique pretty much mastered. Rest the fingers of your right hand on the valves (which are numbered one, two and three, one being closest to you and three closest to the bell), and keep your right pinky either in the air or on top of the hook near the third valve.
