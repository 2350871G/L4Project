Drill your hole roughly 8 inches (20 cm) to 10 inches (25 cm) deep. If your stump is shorter than 8 inches (20 cm), just drill far enough down so that you reach the roots. Make sure you clear the debris out of the hole once you've finished drilling."

Like with your center hole, each hole should be 8 inches (20 cm) to 10 inches (25 cm) deep. If your stump is shorter than this, make sure your holes are at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) deep.

As you did with the holes drilled from the top of the stump, leave roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between each hole you drill along the stump's perimeter. Be sure to drill these holes so that they connect to the holes you drilled from the top down. The more air that is able to circulate throughout the stump, the easier it will be to burn it."

The water will help to spread the nitrate throughout the stump and make the entire structure more flammable. You don't have to pour water into the stump if you opted for charcoal or kerosene instead of potassium nitrate."
