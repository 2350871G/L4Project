Check the finished dimensions of the puzzle on the box and create a wax paper work surface that\u2019s at least 2 in (5.1 cm) bigger on all sides. For instance, if the finished puzzle has listed dimensions of 18 by 24 in (46 by 61 cm), tear off overlapping strips of wax paper to create a work surface that\u2019s at least 20 by 26 in (51 by 66 cm)\nLaying wax paper underneath the puzzle keeps sticky Mod Podge from getting all over your table, counter, desk, floor, or other puzzle-assembly surface.

        "Turn the puzzle back over after 15-20 minutes.",
        "Test with your fingertip to make sure the Mod Podge is only slightly tacky.",
        "As you lift the puzzle, peel away the wax paper if it\u2019s stuck to the edge at all, then flip the puzzle right-side up.",
        "Place it on the wax paper once again.",
        "Cleaning and Displaying the Puzzle Scrape off any excess glue along the edges with a crafting knife.",
        "You\u2019ll likely have some dried Mod Podge that extends over the edges of the jigsaw puzzle.",
        "To remove it, lift one edge of the puzzle at a time and gently press a razor knife or other sharp crafting knife to the side of the edge (that is, not the top or bottom surface of the puzzle).",
        "Slide the blade along the edge, using gentle, even pressure, to scrape away the excess glue.",
        "Work carefully so you don\u2019t cut into the puzzle\u2014or cut yourself!",
        "If you intend to frame the puzzle, feel free to skip this step and instead simply peel off any larger bits of overhanging glue with your fingers.",
        "Sand away any brush marks with #0000 steel wool.",
        "Even if you have an exceptional Mod Podge brushing technique, there will still be some dried brush marks visible on the glossy puzzle surface.",
        "Grab a piece of #0000 steel wool (which is the ultra superfine type) and gently and evenly work it over the surface with small circular motions.",
        "Brush away any resulting dust on the surface with a clean cloth, or just take a deep breath and blow it off of the surface.",
        "Ultra superfine (#0000) steel wool is available at craft stores and online.",
        "Display the jigsaw puzzle as-is or frame it.",
        "With 2 coats of Mod Podge on the front and 1 on the back, your puzzle will be plenty sturdy to display simply by tacking or taping it to a wall.",
        "However, to add a bit more elegance to your display, buy a picture frame that\u2019s large enough to hold your completed puzzle.",
        "As another display option, consider laying the puzzle on a wooden tabletop and then installing a glass tabletop over it."
