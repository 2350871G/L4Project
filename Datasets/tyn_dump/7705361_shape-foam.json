If this is your first time working with foam, try making something simple like the heart depicted in the image above. If you are confident in your molding abilities, try something 3D such as a sphere or pyramid. Draw the shape you have chosen on paper. Ideally the drawing should fit on a standard piece of printer paper, but it does not need to take up the entire page. This drawing will be used as a template to produce the actual sized drawing of your shape. Make sure that the drawing is as close to your desired shape as possible.

Draw squares to the end of the page even if they are partially cut off as shown in the image above. Draw several key points on your gridded shape.

The new grid is a scaled version of your original grid. Multiply the original height and width of your squares by CF to obtain the height and width of squares for the new grid. Draw the same number of squares you did for your original grid. Depending on how big your new grid is, you may want to use larger pieces of paper to draw it. Redraw your key points to scale on your new grid. The location of points on your new grid should be in the same place as the original grid. For example, if you drew a point in the middle of the left lowermost square on your original grid, you would draw a point in the middle of the left lowermost square on your new grid. Connect the key points according to your original drawing to create your new shape. If this is difficult, you may want to draw more points on the original grid and transfer them to your new grid. Cut out your new shape. Cut along the shape's lines as closely as possible. Place your cut-out shape onto a block of foam.

Divide your shape's desired depth by the depth of your foam, the number you get is the number of tracings you need to make. If the number is not whole, round the number up. The extra depth can be melted off later. Shaping the Foam Plug in the electric hand saw. Use an electrical socket that is near the area where you will be cutting the foam. Follow all safety procedures in accordance with your electric saw's instruction manual. Put on safety glasses to ensure that no foam pieces will enter your eyes while you are cutting. Cut out the foam shapes using the electric saw. Make sure you cut along or just outside the shape's lines. The cuts do not need to be perfect; fine details will be made using the hot wire foam cutter. Spray foam adhesive spray on the cross-sections of two foam shapes you want to attach. Spray the cross-sections of the shapes that will be attached until they are completely covered with a light layer of adhesive. The adhesive spray is blue in the image above for emphasis. After spraying one foam shape's cross-section, gently lay the foam on its cross-section that contains no adhesive. Otherwise, the foam will stick to whatever it is placed on. Finish spraying the cross-sections of the two-shapes in under 1 minute. Otherwise, when the two sprayed cross-sections are clasped together to be attached, the adhesive will be dry and the cross-sections will not stick together.

Continue to hold the two foam pieces together until 30 seconds have passed to ensure that they will not come apart.
