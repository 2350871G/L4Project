To ensure that the oven is warm enough to bake the shortbread, set the temperature to 300 degrees Fahrenheit (150 degrees Celsius) and allow it to fully heat. Next, line a cookie sheet with parchment paper to keep the shortbread from sticking after baking. Make sure that your oven rack is in the center position. You can use a silicone baking mat in place of the parchment paper if you prefer. Combine the flour, butter, sugar, and salt in a food processor. Add 1 cup (125 g) plus 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) (18 g) of flour, \u00bd cup (113 g) of unsalted butter that\u2019s been chilled and diced, \u00bc cup (50 g) of sugar, and \u00bc teaspoon (1 g) of salt to the bowl of a food processor. Mix the ingredients together for 20 seconds. If you don\u2019t have a food processor, you can use a blender to mix up the shortbread dough. Mix in the cherries. Once the other ingredients are fully mixed, add \u00bc cup (40 g) of dried cherries to the food processor. Process the mixture for another 20 seconds, or until the cherries are completely chopped. If you like, you can also mix in \u00bc cup (30 g) of your favorite nuts, such as walnuts or pecans. Roll the dough out on a floured surface. After the dough is completely mixed together, remove it from the food processor and transfer it to a floured surface. Gather the dough into a compact ball, and then use a rolling pin to roll it out into a 7-by-9-inch (18-by-23-cm) rectangle that\u2019s approximately \u00bc-inch (6-mm) thick. If you don\u2019t have a rolling pin, you can use a wine bottle, full water bottle, or thermos to roll out the dough. Cut the dough into squares and prick with a fork. After you\u2019ve rolled out the dough, use a sharp knife to slice it into 12 even squares. Next, use a fork to prick each square 3 times. Place the cookies on the cookie sheet and chill. Once the shortbread is cut into squares, carefully transfer them to the lined cookie sheet, placing them so they\u2019re at least 1-inch (2.5-cm) apart. Cover the cookie sheet with plastic wrap, and chill them for at least 20 minutes. You can make the shortbread dough the day before and chill the cookies overnight. However, you should let them sit out at room temperature for about 20 minutes before baking. Be sure not to preheat the oven until you\u2019re ready to bake them too. Bake the cookies until golden brown. After the cookies have been chilled, place the cookies sheet in the preheated oven. Let the shortbread bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the cookies are a light golden brown. You don\u2019t want the shortbread to get too brown, so keep a close eye on the cookies near the end of the baking time. Allow the shortbread to cool. When the cherry shortbread cookies are finished baking, remove the cookie sheet from the oven. Let the cookies cool for 10 minutes on the sheet, and then transfer them to a wire cooling rack to finish cooling for another 20 minutes. Store the cherry shortbread in an airtight container. The cookies should stay fresh for 5 to 7 days. Whipping Up White Chocolate Cherry Shortbread Preheat the oven. To ensure that the oven is warm enough when the shortbread is ready to bake, it\u2019s important to preheat the oven. Set the temperature to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (165 degrees Celsius), and allow it to heat fully. Make sure that you know how your oven indicates that it\u2019s reached the proper temperature. In most cases, it will beep and/or flash an indicator light. Combine the flour and sugar. Add 2 \u00bd cups (325 g) of all-purpose flour and \u00bd cup (100 g) of sugar to a large bowl. Use a whisk to blend the two together until they are fully incorporated. Cut in the butter. Once the flour and sugar are mixed, add 1 cup (227 g) of chilled butter to the bowl. Use a pastry cutter to mix the butter in until the mixture has the texture of coarse crumbs. If you don\u2019t have a pastry cutter, you can use a fork to work the butter into the flour and sugar mixture. Mix in the cherries, almond extract, and some of the white chocolate. When the flour mixture resembles coarse crumbs, add \u00bd cup (50 g) of maraschino cherries that have been drained and finely chopped, \u00bd teaspoon (2 \u00bd ml) of almond extract, and 4 ounces (112 g) of white chocolate baking squares that have been finely chopped. Stir well to ensure that all of the ingredients are fully incorporated. If you want the shortbread to have a red color, you can mix in a couple of drops of red food coloring with the cherries, almond extract, and white chocolate. Knead the dough and shape into balls. Once the dough is fully mixed, use clean hands to knead the dough until it is smooth. Next, work the dough into \u00be-inch (19-mm) balls, and place them on an ungreased cookie sheet so they are approximately 2-inches (5-cm) apart. If you\u2019re concerned about the shortbread sticking, you can line the cookie sheet with parchment paper. Flatten the balls and bake until the cookies are set. When the dough balls are on the cookie sheet, dip a drinking glass in granulated sugar and press it onto the balls to flatten them into 1 \u00bd-inch (4-cm) rounds. Place the cookie sheet in the preheated oven, and allow the cookies to bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until the centers are completely set. Adding the sugar to the tops of the cookies is optional. You can omit it, or use a decorative colored sugar if you prefer. Melt the remaining white chocolate and shortening. While the cookies are baking, add the remaining 8 ounces (228 g) of finely chopped white chocolate and 2 teaspoons (9 g) of shortening to a small saucepan. Heat the two ingredients on the stove over low heat until they are completely melted, which should take approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Be sure to stir the white chocolate mixture regularly as you heat it to ensure that it melts evenly. Cool the cookies. When the cookies are finished baking, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Allow the cookies to cool for 1 minute on the sheet, and then transfer them to a wire cooling rack to cool completely, which should take 15 to 20 minutes. Dip half of the cookies into the melted chocolate and allow to set. When the cookies are cool, dip one half of each into the melted white chocolate. Let the excess drip off, and place the cookies on a piece of parchment or wax paper to allow the chocolate to set completely, which should take 1 to 2 hours. If you like, you can press the dipped end of the cookies in colored sugar, sprinkles, or nonpareils to a more decorative look if you prefer. Make sure to do it before the white chocolate has set, though. Keep the cookies in an airtight container. They should stay fresh for 3 to 5 days. Creating Chocolate Cherry Shortbread Combine the flour and salt. Add 2 cups (250 g) of all-purpose flour and \u00bd teaspoon (2 g) of salt to a medium bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until they are fully combined. Set the bowl aside. Cream the butter and sugar. Add 1 cup (227 g) of unsalted butter that\u2019s been softened to room temperature and \u00bd cup (63 g) of powdered sugar to a separate large bowl. Use an electric mixer to beat the two together on medium speed until the mixture is light and fluffy. You can mix the shortbread dough in a stand mixer if you prefer.

It\u2019s best to add a small amount of the flour mixture and mix the addition in before adding any more. Stir in the cherries and chocolate chips. When the dough has started to come together, add \u00be cup (75 g) of maraschino cherries that have been drained and finely chopped and \u2154 cup (115 g) of chocolate chips to the bowl. Use a wooden spoon to gently mix the cherries and chips in until they are fully incorporated. You can use whatever type of chocolate chips you like for the shortbread. Milk, semisweet, and bittersweet all work well with the cherries. Form the dough into a log and chill. After you\u2019ve mixed in the cherries and chocolate chips, use clean hands to form the dough into a log. Press on the log to ensure that it\u2019s firmly packed, and wrap it in plastic. Allow it to chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 to 2 hours. You can make the dough the day before and allow it to chill overnight if you prefer. Preheat the oven and line a baking sheet. When you\u2019re ready to make the cookies, set the oven temperature to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (165 degrees Celsius) and allow it to fully heat. Next, line a baking sheet with parchment paper to prevent the shortbread from sticking. You can use a silicone baking mat in place of the parchment paper if you prefer. Slice the log into cookies and bake until they are golden. When you\u2019re ready to bake the cookies, use a knife to cut the dough log into \u00bc- to \u2153-inch (6- to 8-mm) thick slices.
