        "Keep the temperature between 300 and 310\u00b0F (148.89 and 154.45\u00b0C).",
        "Do not allow it to reach 320\u00b0F (160\u00b0C) or your sugar glass will caramelize and turn brown.",
        "If you do not have a candy thermometer, test the candy by dropping a tiny amount into a glass of cold water.",
        "The candy has reached the \"hard crack\" phase if it hardens into threads.",
        "Slowly pour the hot candy into the baking sheet.",
        "This will minimize any bubbles.",
        "The candy will be thick, and spread slowly across the baking sheet.",
        "Place the baking sheet onto an even surface and let the candy harden.",
        "This will help the candy spread out evenly so that the finished glass is smooth and not lumpy.",

        "Use the knife to carefully loosen the candy from the baking sheet.",

        "Making Sugar Sea Glass Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray.",
        "The baking sheet needs to have raised sides, or the melted candy will slide off.",
        "If you can't find any cooking spray, wrap the inside of the sheet with tin foil or parchment paper.",
        "Sugar sea glass is different from basic sugar glass.",
        "It is colored and frosted, just like real sea glass.",
        "Combine the sugar, water, and light corn syrup in a pot.",

        "If your candy thermometer doesn't have a clip, tie it to the handle of the pot with a piece of string.",
        "This way, it won't fall into your candy.",
        "Keep heating and stirring your candy until it reaches 300\u00b0F (148.89\u00b0C).",
        "This is very important.",
        "If you don't get your mixture hot enough, it won't harden properly.",
        "Your candy will be soft and sticky, no matter how long you let it sit, harden, or cool.",
        "It will take about an hour for it to reach this stage.",
        "Do not let the temperature to reach 320\u00b0F (160\u00b0C) or your sugar glass will start to caramelize and turn brown.",
        "If you don't have a candy thermometer, drop a small amount into a glass of cold water.",

        "Remove the pot from the stove and add in the food coloring and/or 1 teaspoon of candy flavoring.",
        "You will only need a few drops of food coloring.",
        "The more drops you add, the darker your sea glass will be.",
        "The color you use is up to you, but most sea glass is green or blue.",
        "You can also leave your sea glass clear; it will become more white once you add the powdered sugar.",
        "Use only one flavor and color per batch.",
        "Consider matching your flavoring to the color.",
        "For example, you can use blueberry flavoring for blue sea glass, mint flavoring for green glass, and vanilla flavoring for white/clear glass.",
        "You can buy the coloring and flavoring in the baking section of an arts and crafts store.",
        "You may also find them in a store that sells baking and cooking supplies.",
