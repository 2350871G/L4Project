Add 1 cup (250 g) of crunchy peanut butter to the saucepan and adjust the stovetop to a medium heat. Stir the ingredients occasionally until they have melted. If you prefer, you can use half suet and half lard. You can purchase this from your local grocery store or butchery. There are many different options for the type of suet or lard that you can use to make no-melt bird suet. You can use rendered suet, beef tallow, lard, vegetable shortening, or bacon drippings. Birds will eat all of these different types, so pick the one that you prefer. Use peanut butter without added sugar if possible, as this is healthier for the birds."
