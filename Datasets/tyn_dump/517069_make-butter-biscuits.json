The butter and flour  prevents  the biscuit dough from sticking while baking. Mix the butter and sugar in a large bowl.  Mix two eggs in a small bowl and add the vanilla extract to it.  Slowly add the egg mixture to the sugar/butter. Avoid pouring everything at once since it'll make it curdle. Get a separate bowl and mix the flour, salt, and baking powder in it. Gradually add this flour mixture to the butter mixture. Mix thoroughly so that there's no lumps formed from the flour and turns into a dough. Take the dough out of the bowl and gently create a ball out of it. Divide the dough ball into two equal halves. Slightly flatten down each half and cover with cling film. Place both halves in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven for 350 degrees F or 180 degrees C.  Roll the chilled dough on a floured surface (such as a cutting board or counter top).
