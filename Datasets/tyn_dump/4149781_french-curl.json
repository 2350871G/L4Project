If you\u2019re standing, keep your feet shoulder-width apart and your back as straight as possible. If you\u2019re using a bench, keep your back straight while leaning against the bench and contract your core. Your feet should be flat against the floor."

If your thumbs can touch, this is the right width. Your hands should be about 8 to 12 in (20 to 30 cm) apart, so it\u2019s a pretty close grip. If you\u2019re struggling to get into position, ask a friend to hand you the bar from behind. This can be especially helpful if you\u2019re using pretty heavy weights. If you\u2019re using an EZ curl bar, place your hands along the angled grooves of the bar. For this exercise, the curl bar tends to be easier to grip than a regular barbell. This is because it lets you hold your wrists at a more natural angle."
