If you already have a carrier, make sure that he can still fit inside of it. If you do not have a carrier, one can be purchased at your local pet store, department store, or online. As an alternative, you could ask to borrow a carrier from a friend or possibly find one at your local thrift store, but be sure to clean and dry it thoroughly before use.
