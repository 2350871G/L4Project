Brush with the product at least twice daily for at least one month to see results. Buy a product with at least 3.5% hydrogen peroxide, which is the standard amount. Be aware that the more hydrogen peroxide in a product, the likely it is to make your teeth sensitive. Brush your teeth twice a day with the toothpaste. It can take four to six weeks to notice results. Recognize that toothpastes only remove surface stains from activities like drinking or smoking. Consider using another peroxide product in addition to a toothpaste to get deeper stains and have better results.

Buy an over-the-counter gel tray or have your dentist prescribe one. Buy either pre-filled trays or trays you fill with a product at your local pharmacy. Be aware that these products will fit most mouths and are not molded to your own teeth. Ask your dentist to mold a tray to your mouth and give you a higher concentration peroxide solution for more optimal results. Leave the tray in your mouth for the time suggested on the packaging. Most trays require application for 30 minutes three times a day for two weeks. Discontinue use if you experience serious sensitivity, though most will stop after the treatment.
