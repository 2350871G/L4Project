Make sure all the nitrogenous bases (adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine) are represented on each outer strand. In order to do this, assign a particular color to each base. For example, you could use red for adenine, blue for thymine, green for cytosine, and yellow for guanine. After you\u2019ve assigned the colors, you can accurately pair the complementary bases. Adenine always pairs with thymine, while guanine pairs with cytosine. So, if you have a red (adenine) pipe cleaner on one side, put a blue (thymine) pipe cleaner in the same spot on the other side, and so on.

Making a DNA Model with Styrofoam Purchase 48 white Styrofoam balls for your project. Look for Styrofoam balls that are around 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter. Make sure you get white balls since you\u2019ll need to paint them different colors for your project. You can find Styrofoam balls at your local craft store or online.

        "To attach the strands, wrap the inner strands around their outer strand so they\u2019re evenly spaced apart up and down the strand.",
        "Alternate colors as you go.",
        "Leave about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of each inner strand extending off of the outer strand it\u2019s attached to.",
        "You want the ends of the inner strands that are extending off of the outer strands to all be going in the same direction.",
        "Line up the inner strands on both outer strands and tape them together.",
        "When you line up the strands, the pipe cleaners should look like a ladder.",
        "To tape the inner strands together, simply line up the ends so they\u2019re overlapping slightly and then wrap a piece of clear tape around them.",
        "Do this for each set of inner strands along your model.",
        "If you don\u2019t have clear tape, that\u2019s OK. You can use different tape instead.",
        "It may just be a little visible once your model is finished.",
        "Twist the strands into a helix to finish your DNA model.",
        "To twist your model into a helix, start by grabbing onto each end with your hands and slowly twisting your hands in opposite directions.",
        "Once your model has a spiral shape, press your hands together to squish the model flat, which will help the pipe cleaners remain twisted in a helix.",
        "Once your DNA model retains its shape, you\u2019re finished!",
        "If your model starts to lose its shape after a while, just twist and compress it with your hands again.",
        "Making a DNA Model with Styrofoam Purchase 48 white Styrofoam balls for your project.",
        "Look for Styrofoam balls that are around 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter.",
        "Make sure you get white balls since you\u2019ll need to paint them different colors for your project.",
        "You can find Styrofoam balls at your local craft store or online.",
        "Take 24 of the balls and paint 12 green and leave 12 white.",
        "These green and white balls will make up the strands that run along the outside of your DNA model, or the sugar and phosphate of your double helix.",
        "To paint half of the balls green, use a paintbrush to apply a thin layer of green, water-based paint.",
        "Then, set the balls aside to dry while you work on the rest of your model.",
        "You can find water-based paint at your local craft store or department store.",
        "You can also order some online.",
        "Split the other 24 balls into piles of 6 and paint each pile a different color.",
        "Use red, blue, yellow, and orange to paint the balls in the piles.",
        "These balls will make up the inner strands of your DNA model, which represent guanine, cytosine, thymine, and adenine.",
        "When you\u2019re finished painting each ball, set it aside to dry on a sheet of newspaper or a paper towel.",
        "You should have 6 red balls, 6 blue balls, 6 yellow balls, and 6 orange balls.",
        "Slide 1 red ball and 1 yellow ball onto a toothpick so they\u2019re connected.",
        "Your DNA model will be made up of individual \u201crungs\u201d (like on a ladder), and these 2 balls will be the center of the first rung.",
        "Leave a little space between the balls so they\u2019re not touching.",
        "Attach a white ball to each end of the first rung.",
        "To attach the white balls, start by inserting toothpicks into the red and yellow balls so that each toothpick is lined up with the toothpick in the center.",
        "Then, stick a white ball onto the end of each toothpick.",
        "When you\u2019re finished, the first rung should have a white ball on each end and a red and yellow ball in the middle.",
        "Insert toothpicks into the tops of the white balls at opposite angles.",
        "These toothpicks\u20141 on each white ball\u2014will help support the next rung up on your DNA model, so you want them to be sticking up out of the top of the white balls on the first rung.",
        "However, to give your DNA model the proper helix shape, you\u2019ll want to angle the toothpicks slightly and insert them so they\u2019re pointing in opposite directions.",
        "The angle of the toothpicks doesn\u2019t need to be precise.",
        "As long as they\u2019re sticking up at an angle and they\u2019re angled in opposite directions, your model will work.",
        "Stick a green ball onto the toothpicks sticking out of each white ball.",
        "Push the green balls down all the way so they\u2019re touching the white balls.",
        "These green and white balls will make up the outer strands of your model, and they\u2019ll help support the next rung.",
        "The green balls represent phosphate, while the white ones represent sugar (deoxyribose).",
        "Since you angled the toothpicks in the white balls, the green balls should be sitting on top of the white balls at an angle as well.",
        "Create the next rung using blue and orange balls this time.",
        "The colors should alternate in each rung in your model.",
        "Since you used red and yellow balls to make the first rung, you\u2019ll want to use blue and orange balls to make the next one.",
        "Just like with the first rung, start by connecting a blue and orange ball with a toothpick.",
        "Then, attach a white ball to each end of the rung.",
        "In order to accurately represent the complementary base pairs, make sure to always pair red with yellow and blue with orange between the 2 strands.",
        "You should also insert a toothpick into each white ball so they\u2019re angled in opposite directions like you did with the first rung.",
        "Use toothpicks to attach the second rung to the green balls.",
        "Insert a toothpick into each green ball so it\u2019s angled in the same direction as the toothpick in the white ball below it.",
        "Then, stick the white balls at the end of the second rung onto these toothpicks.",
        "At this point you\u2019ll be able to see the beginning of your DNA model\u2019s helix shape.",
        "Continue to attach new rungs until you\u2019ve used all of the Styrofoam balls.",
        "Remember to alternate the colors you\u2019re using when you\u2019re building the rungs.",
        "Also, don\u2019t forget to attach green balls in between each rung in the model.",
        "Once you\u2019ve used all of the balls, your DNA model is finished!",
        "If you want your model to stand up on its own, attach the rung at the bottom to a Styrofoam block using toothpicks."
