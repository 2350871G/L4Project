    "text": " Setting up for Repair Work Locate the leak. Before you begin, inspect the faucet to figure out where the leak is. Leaks almost always emanate from either the faucet\u2019s base or the spout. Knowing where the leak is will help you determine what parts are responsible for the leak. Turn the faucet\u2019s water supply off. Look under your sink first. You may see a pair of valves you can turn clockwise to stop water from flowing into the faucet. If the valves aren\u2019t there, turn off the main water line. It is usually indoors, in the basement, next to the water meter. Turn the faucet on to relieve the water pressure. Before taking apart the faucet, check to see that the water supply has been turned off. Let the water flow out of the faucet until it stops. Any built-up pressure will also drain away. Cover the sink hole with a strainer to catch small parts. It\u2019s no fun to drop a small but important piece down the sink. To save yourself additional work, place the sink\u2019s strainer baskets over the drain. If you don\u2019t have strainers, cover the drains with rags or towels. Label and take pictures of the faucet as you remove parts. After fixing the faucet, you will have to return the parts in the proper order. To remember this order, keep a camera nearby to record your work. Also, keep the parts separated and ordered so you know when you need each piece. Pour some vinegar into a container to clean faucet parts. You will most likely notice mineral buildup on some of the parts. Soak the parts in vinegar for a couple of minutes first to soften the buildup, then scrub them off with a microfiber cloth or a nylon abrasive pad. A screwdriver can also be helpful for scraping away debris inside the faucet\u2019s parts. Fixing a Ball Faucet Use an Allen wrench to remove the handle. Lift the handle and look for a small hole underneath it, near the faucet's stem. Use the Allen wrench to turn the screw counterclockwise until you can lift the handle off of the faucet. Tighten the adjusting ring to fix leaks in the handle\u2019s base. Grip the top of the metal cap with a spanner tool. Turn the cap clockwise to tighten the white, plastic ring inside of it. If your leak was at the handle\u2019s base, this may be enough to repair it. Replace the handle and turn on the water to test it. A spanner tool is typically included in the repair kits available for this type of faucet. Otherwise, visit a home improvement store. Remove the cap by turning it counterclockwise. Using a pair of slip-joint pliers, grip the top end of the metal cap. Rotate it counterclockwise to loosen it. Set aside the cap, then remove the 2 plastic rings inside the faucet to expose the ball. Take out the metal ball and replace it if it\u2019s damaged. Pick up the ball and look it over to make sure it isn\u2019t worn or cracked. If it is, replace it with a new ball purchased from a hardware store or taken from a repair kit. Replace the rubber rings and springs under the ball. Put the head of screwdriver through the rings and springs to help lift them out of the faucet. Place the new springs in the holes in the faucet, then drop new rubber seats on top of them. Press them down with your finger to set them in place. Reassemble the faucet. Place the metal ball on the rubber pieces, matching the ball\u2019s groove to the one in the faucet. Put the 2 plastic rings back in place next. Then put the metal cap back in place and tighten it with pliers. Finally, screw the handle back onto the faucet with the Allen wrench. Repairing a Cartridge Faucet Pry the handle\u2019s cap off with a knife. The cap will be on top of the faucet handle. Hold the knife flat and stick the blade under the cap. Gently lift it up to expose the Allen screw. Use an Allen wrench to remove the handle. Turn the screw counterclockwise to loosen the handle. Lift it off the stem and set it aside. Remove the dome assembly by hand. Underneath the handle, you will see a metal cap. Twist it counterclockwise by hand to remove it. If it\u2019s stuck in place, use pliers to unscrew it. Unscrew the metal handle adapter with a Phillips screwdriver. Hold the screwdriver vertically and lower the tip into the metal adapter. The screw is on the bottom. Twist it counterclockwise to remove it, then set aside the metal adapter as well as the plastic piece underneath it. Use pliers to remove the retainer nut. You should see the top end of the cartridge now, most likely copper-colored. Grip the black, plastic piece around it with pliers. Turn it counterclockwise until it\u2019s loose enough to lift off the faucet. Lift the retainer clip with pliers. The clip is the copper-colored, horseshoe-shaped piece of metal. Use a screwdriver to lift it up so that you can grab onto it with the pliers. Pull it horizontally, away from the cartridge, to remove it. Twist the cartridge with pliers to remove it. Replacement cartridges come with a plastic cap that you need to place on top of the old cartridge first.

If the hot and cold water flows are reversed, turn the cartridge around. To ensure that the faucet lasts longer, replace any worn or damaged parts. Take them to the home improvement or hardware store to get the correct replacement. Fixing a Ceramic Disc Faucet Remove the screw cover with knife. On ceramic disc faucets, the screw cover is near the bottom of the handle. Lift the handle up and you will see it. Slip the end of a knife behind it and gently pry it off. Use an Allen wrench to remove the handle. Stick the Allen wrench into the hole under the screw cover. Turn the screw counterclockwise to loosen and remove the handle. Twist off the metal cap with pliers. Underneath the handle, you will find a metal cap. Wrap the pliers around the top end and twist the cap counterclockwise to remove it. Use a screwdriver to remove the disc cartridge. Next, you will see the disc cartridge plastic cover. Look for 3 holes around the outside edge. Use a Phillips screwdriver to turn the screws counterclockwise and remove them. Lift the disc cartridge out of the faucet afterwards. Replace the rubber seals in the cartridge. Flip over the cartridge to find the rubber seals. They may look worn or broken. Bring the rings into a home improvement or hardware store to find replacements, then insert them into the holes under the cartridge. If the rubber seals are dirty but not broken, try scrubbing them with a microfiber cloth or soaking them in vinegar to clean them. Ceramic disc faucets are designed to last a long time, so they usually come with a long warranty.

Use a screwdriver to lift it and find the rings underneath it. Replace the rings if they look damaged by fitting new ones into the disc\u2019s holes. Clean the holes in the faucet with vinegar. Check the holes in the faucet\u2019s base for any signs of mineral buildup. Dampen a microfiber cloth with vinegar, then scrub the holes to clean them. Reassemble the faucet. This shouldn\u2019t be too difficult if you remember the correct order for the pieces. Replace the plastic disc first, followed by the cartridge, the cap, and then the handle. Remember to screw the cartridge and handle in place. If the faucet still leaks, the cartridge may be cracked. Take it to the hardware store to order a replacement. Remember to check your warranty to avoid paying for this expensive part. Repairing a Spout Faucet Twist the handle to remove it. Spout faucets don\u2019t have screws. The handle fits loosely over the faucet\u2019s stem, so it\u2019s very easy to remove by hand. Twist it back and forth to pull it off. Remove the o-rings to fix a base leak.

Bring them to a plumber\u2019s supply store or hardware store to find new ones. Lubricate replacement o-rings with plumber\u2019s grease. Also purchase a small container of plumber\u2019s grease from the store. Coat the o-rings in the grease, then slide them over the faucet. Fit them into the faucet\u2019s grooves. Replace the handle and test the faucet. Clean the diverter valve with vinegar. The diverter valve is the small plastic piece on the front of the faucet. Remove the handle to find it, then pull on it.
