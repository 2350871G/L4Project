You can put your overhead storage above the garage door so that when the door is pulled up, you can't see any bins. Use your wall organizers to hold your odd items like rakes, brooms, and shovels. Handling Legal Permits and Inspections Submit a permit application to your local building authority. Consult your local government to learn about their building rules and application process. You will most likely need to bring them a sketch of your project. The sketch should show exactly what kind of garage you plan on building and prove that it falls within the authority\u2019s regulations. The location of your garage and its size can affect the chances of getting your application approved. If you hire an architect or other contractors, they can usually help you get your application approved. Pay the fees for the building application. Your government will likely charge an administration fee, which varies in cost from place to place. Fork over the money when you turn in your application. The building authority will then review your application. You will typically need to pay by check or with a credit or debit card. You may also need to pay additional fees for inspections. Many times, contractors handle these fees and include the cost in the final bill they give you. Wait 6 to 8 weeks to get your application approved. During this time, the building authority considers your permit. Anyone in the community with an objection to the project has an opportunity to discuss it. Once the hearings are over, the local council sends you an approval notice, which means you can begin building the garage. Most objections come from the building authority and have to do with local building regulations. You may need to adjust your proposal to get the permit. If the review seems to be taking a long time, call the building authority to speed up the process. Have an inspector check the garage as it is built. Check your local government\u2019s building regulations to see when you need to have an inspector look at your garage. You will usually need to have someone come out a couple of times during the process. The main times are when you lay the concrete foundation and build the frame. The inspector checks the work to see if it follows local building codes. If you hire contractors, they will often contact an inspector for you. You may need to have an inspector review the work at other times, such as when electrical wiring is installed and after the garage is completed. Building the Foundation Call the utility company to mark underground utilities in the area. Underground utility lines, such as water or gas lines, can easily be damaged during construction. In addition, you cannot build over these lines. Contact your utility companies so they can mark the location of the lines with paint and little flags. If you want to build over a line, you will need to ask the utility company to move it first. Stake out the construction area. Once you have your plans in hand, position wooden stakes around the area\u2019s perimeter. Connect the stakes with twine, then let the twine rest on the ground. This boundary maps out the construction area so you can see where the work needs to be done. Double check to make sure the utility lines aren\u2019t in the building area. Grade the building area by leveling it. The construction process is started by flattening the land. You or an excavator you hire will dig up the area marked by the stakes and twine. You will usually need heavy construction equipment to dig a hole for the garage\u2019s foundation. The foundation is the garage\u2019s concrete base. The soil around it may be shifted to form a slope, which helps water drain away from the garage. Dig out footings to keep the garage steady. Footings are trenches dug around the foundation. They are filled with concrete, which prevents the garage from sinking into soft soil. The trenches are big and deep, usually running along the sides of the foundation. You will need to hire an excavator to do this. Unless you have experience constructing building foundations, you are better off hiring a professional with an excavator instead of doing it yourself. Install any in-ground drains or heating elements. These features need to be put into place before the foundation is complete. Once you pour concrete for the foundation, you cannot install in-ground features without breaking your garage floor. Install these features by laying them in the ground and connecting them to any necessary utility lines. If you have contractors working on the garage, make sure they know that you want these features in your garage. Pour the concrete for the foundation. After the soil is settled, it is time to fill in the footings and create the foundation. You or your contractor will need to mix a lot of concrete, pour it into the construction area, and then smooth it out. Once the concrete dries, you can begin building your garage. Let a building company handle this if you don\u2019t have much experience creating foundations. A good foundation ensures your garage is stable.",

        "When it is finished, though, you can reach the garage without having to step outside.",
        "You will need space to put the garage next to the home as well as space in your home to install a door.",

        "Build a detached garage if you need more building space.",
        "Detached garages can be positioned anywhere on your property.",
        "This is useful if you don\u2019t have space next to your home for a garage.",
        "This type of garage is cheaper to build and can offer a little more stylistic creativity.",
        "Since the garage isn\u2019t attached to the house, you have more leeway in the design.",

        "You may be able to build an attic, a loft, or alter the garage\u2019s framing to clear out more space.",
        "For example, you can build a dormer.",
        "A dormer is a small projection on the roof, but isn\u2019t technically a second floor.",
        "Depending on your garage, you may even be able to build a separate room above it.",
        "Remember that you will also need to install stairs or a ladder.",
        "Choose the size and number of doors you need for your garage.",
        "The size of your garage door depends on how you use your garage.",
        "An average garage door is about 7 ft (2.1 m) tall and 9 ft (2.7 m) wide.",
        "If you plan on parking trucks and other vehicles, you may need a taller garage with bigger doors.",
        "Also plan for any other doors you need, such as back doors or attachment doors.",
        "Also consider the number of doors you need.",
        "You may want separate doors to park multiple cars, but you can get 1 large door instead.",
        "Features like electronic door openers cost extra, but they can be installed at a later date.",
        "Creating and Detailing a Blueprint Establish a budget to avoid overspending on the garage.",
        "The blueprint is the first concern you need to handle.",
        "The blueprint costs money to make.",
        "Any features you add to the garage, as well as the materials you use, can up the final cost of your project.",
        "Also consider any contractors you need to hire.",
        "You can research the costs for most features and services online before speaking with contractors.",
        "You can discuss building costs with any contractors you need to hire.",
        "They can offer alternatives if you exceed your budget.",

        "Keep this size in mind as you begin working on a blueprint and speaking to contractors.",
        "If you want space for a workshop, for instance, you may want a smaller garage without car parking.",
        "The space you have available depends on the zoning regulations in your area as well as the size of your property.",
        "Place windows around the room for visibility.",
        "Most garages will have a couple of windows.",
        "This is especially useful if you plan on converting your garage into a workshop, since the windows can let in light and fresh air.",
        "However, you will need to determine the placement and add this to your plan.",

        "These features are often not included in a garage because they raise the cost of building too much.",
        "However, if you plan on spending a lot of time in the garage, they can be worth installing.",
        "You often need to install these features before you lay the garage\u2019s foundation.",
        "For example, you may want a radiant in floor heating system or a water drain.",
        "These need to be installed before the floor is finished.",
        "Install a retaining wall if you live near a hill.",
        "Retaining walls are stone or concrete walls that hold soil in place.",

        "Get a construction company to build the wall for you if you aren\u2019t comfortable building it yourself.",
        "Building a retaining wall is similar to setting up the garage\u2019s foundation.",

        "Type \u201cgarage plans\u201d into a search engine.",
        "You can find a lot of free plans to download right away, or you can buy different plans off of various websites.",

        "You can always make adjustments to the plan, such as if you want a bigger garage or extra features.",
        "Hire an architect or drafters to customize plans for you.",
        "An architect or an architectural drafter can sketch plans for you.",
        "Hiring someone to create new plans costs $1,000 or more, so this service is a significant part of your budget.",
        "However, they can make sure your garage is exactly what you want while still complying with local building codes.",
        "Architects and drafters can match your garage to your home or add custom features to existing plans.",
        "If you get plans elsewhere, you can still hire a drafter to make alterations.",
        "Sometimes you can have them customize an existing plan for as little as $50.",
        "Sketch your plans yourself to save money.",
        "Get a pencil and a piece of graph paper, then draw out the garage you want.",
        "Try to make it as accurate as possible.",
        "You may need to take measurements of your building space so you can include them in your drawing.",
        "Many times, you can work directly from the plan you have sketched.",
        "Depending on where you live, you may still be required to get a plan from an architect.",
        "They can often copy your sketch.",
