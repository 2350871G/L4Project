Try to find one that is a solid color or printed on the outside if you don\u2019t want anyone to know what\u2019s inside of the bag. If you\u2019re having trouble finding one, try looking in the cosmetic section of a supermarket, or order a cosmetic bag from an online retailer."

                    "description": "Pantyliners are great for protecting your underwear from discharge or wearing on a day where your flow is lighter. On days with a heavier flow, you\u2019ll need to use a pad. Whatever you decide to wear, make sure you change it every 4-6 hours to ensure that you don\u2019t have any leaks. If you\u2019ve never used a sanitary pad before, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s easy! Simply remove the plastic wrapper and protective paper strip from the back, and place the sticky side on the inside of your underwear. If the pad has wings, remove the paper strips from the adhesive and fold them out and around your underwear to keep the pad in place. Never flush a pad or pantyliner down the toilet. When you\u2019re done with the pad, take it out of your underwear and fold it up to throw it in the trash."

                    "description": "Tampons are made of cotton and other fibers and can be inserted into your vagina to absorb blood. Many women use tampons when they\u2019re going swimming or doing other activities that would be uncomfortable while wearing a pad. Change your tampon every 6-8 hours. Generally, you should try to avoid wearing a tampon during your first period. It can be difficult to predict how heavy your flow will be, and wearing the wrong size tampon can cause discomfort or leaks. NEVER practice wearing a tampon before your period because the tampon will be dry and painful to pull out. Try to avoid flushing your tampons down the toilet because they can expand in the water and cause the toilet to clog."

Fold them up so that they fit into the bag with the rest of your items. Try to pick dark-colored, comfortable pairs of underwear and pants. Darker colors tend to show stains less than lighter colors. Also be sure that you don\u2019t mind them getting spoiled."

Eat a piece of chocolate to boost your mood between classes or for a burst of energy when you\u2019re just feeling \u201cblah.\u201d\nIf you don\u2019t like dark chocolate, add a package of mints, which can help to soothe mild cramps and stomach pain."

Look for a small package to fit in your bag, and only include it if you\u2019re allowed to take them to school. Some schools don\u2019t let students carry medicine with them. However, you can talk to your school nurse and have a parent drop off a bottle of ibuprofen or naproxen in the office in case you need it to handle cramps or a headache. If you have cramps, ask to visit the nurse, and they will give you the right dose. You can find small containers of medication at most grocery stores and pharmacies."

Be sure to seal the bottle of hand sanitizer tightly when you put it back in the bag to prevent it from spilling on the rest of the items. If you don\u2019t want to include liquid hand sanitizer, look for sanitizing wipes in the supermarket. With wipes, there\u2019s no risk for a leak or spill!"

If you notice that you don't get a monthly period or have your period for more than 7 days at a time after the first 5-6 months, talk to your doctor about possible causes for this.
