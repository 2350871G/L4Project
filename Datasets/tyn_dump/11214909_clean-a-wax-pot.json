If you\u2019ve been using a wax that melts at medium-high, turn the heat up as high as it will go. The wax has to melt thoroughly before you can clean out the interior pot. Keep your lid open if you can. This will make it easier to monitor your wax as you heat it. Use a higher setting than you normally use to ensure that your wax reaches a thinner consistency than it does when you\u2019re applying or melting it. This will keep older wax buildup from sticking to the sides. On most wax pots, the inner pot is the only portion that you will need to regularly clean."

        "Whether it\u2019s a mason jar or metal container on an electric skillet or standard metal pot on a burner, heat it up the way you normally would to begin melting the wax.",
        "Using glass on an electric skillet can cause it to shatter.",
        "If this is how you typically melt your wax, consider switching to a metal pot that is designed to withstand heat.",
        "You can use a blow-dryer if you don\u2019t have your normal heating method available or heating element is damaged.",

        "As the water cools, the wax will harden again and you will be able to strain the water in a colander.",
        "Do this outside or over another pot if you can to prevent wax from getting in a drain.",

        "Scrape any remaining wax with a spatula or spoon.",
        "Use a wooden spatula or spoon to scrape any residue or remaining bits of wax.",
