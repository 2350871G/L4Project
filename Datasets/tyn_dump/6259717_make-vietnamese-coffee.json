In a pinch, you can use evaporated milk, which is unsweetened condensed milk. To use evaporated milk, combine a can of evaporated milk and 1\u00bd cups (338 g) of sugar in a saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil, whisking constantly, to dissolve the sugar. Remove the milk from the heat and set it aside to cool."

If the water is draining too quickly or slowly, you can adjust the drip rate by tightening or loosening the screw. Adjust the screw tension if necessary. If the water streamed through the filter instead of dripping slowly, turn the screw clockwise one full turn to tighten the filter insert. If the water didn\u2019t drip through in the 20 seconds, turn the screw counterclockwise one full turn to loosen the filter insert. Add the remaining water. When the coffee has had time to bloom and you\u2019ve adjusted the drip rate, fill the brewing chamber with hot water. Place the lid on the brewing chamber to keep in the heat as the coffee brews.

Drinking Vietnamese Coffee Leave the condensed milk separate on the bottom if you like. Some people like to drink Vietnamese coffee unstirred. This way, you drink the black coffee first, and then finish the beverage with the sweet, coffee-flavored condensed milk that stayed on the bottom. When you drink coffee like this, it\u2019s like eating fruit on the bottom yogurt unstirred and leaving the sweet fruit until the end. Stir the beverage to combine the milk and coffee if you prefer. Many people prefer to stir the coffee and milk together. This way, the bitter coffee is sweetened and doesn\u2019t taste as strong. You can also add additional sugar, to taste, if you like. Serve the coffee hot or iced. The coffee is ready to drink as soon as it\u2019s brewed. If you don\u2019t feel like an iced coffee, enjoy the coffee immediately while it\u2019s still hot.
