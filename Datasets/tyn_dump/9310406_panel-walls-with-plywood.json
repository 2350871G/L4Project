If you\u2019re just paneling one wall with plywood, you'll only need the length of that wall. Divide the perimeter of the room by the length of the plywood panels you want to use to find out how many panels you'll need. For example, if the perimeter of the room is 24 feet (7.3 meters), and the plywood panels you want to use are 4 feet (1.2 meters) across, you would need six panels. If you\u2019re paneling one wall that\u2019s 15 feet (4.6 meters) long, and the plywood panels you want to use are 4 feet (1.2 meters) across, you would need four plywood panels. Four of the panels would equal 16 feet (4.9 meters), so you\u2019d need to cut 1 foot (0.3 meters) off one of the panels."
