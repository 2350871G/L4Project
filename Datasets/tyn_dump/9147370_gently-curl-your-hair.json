    "text": " Using a Curling Iron Apply a heat protection spray to your hair. If you have straight or fine hair, consider adding a mousse as well, from roots to ends. If you have thick or coarse hair, it might be a good idea to add a smoothing oil, from the middle of your hair down to the ends. The mousse or smoothing oil are optional. If you decide to use them, you should apply them in addition to the heat protection spray. Blow dry your hair, if needed. If your hair feels damp after applying all those products, you'll need to dry it. Pull your hair taut and aim the hairdryer downward while drying it because it will prevent frizz. This will keep the strands nice and smooth. Curl the first stands away from your face. Take a 1 to 2-inch (2.5 to 5-centimeter) wide vertical section of hair from next to your face. Wrap it around a 1\u00bc-inch (3.2-centimeter) curling iron, going away from your face. Press down on the clamp, hold it for a few seconds, then unclamp it.

Lightly mist your hair with a texturizing spray, then scrunch it upwards as the spray dries. Set your style with a flexible hold hairspray, if needed. If your hair holds curls well or has a coarse texture, you may not need to do this. Using a Headband Start with slightly damp hair. You can hop in the shower and get your hair wet, or you can mist your hair with water. If you decide to wash your hair, let it dry to the point where it is damp and no longer dripping. If your hair is not damp enough, it won't curl. If your hair is too wet, it will take too long to dry. You can find a water bottle for spritzing your hair at a beauty supply store or online. For best results, you will need to leave your hair curled for several hours - perhaps overnight - if you use this process. Alternatively, you could apply heat from a hair dryer or hooded dryer to speed up the process. Slip a wide, fabric headband over your head. Choose a wide, fabric headband that is a few inches/centimeters wide. Slip it over your head, so that it rests right above your ears. Don't tuck it under your hair. Split your hair into two equal-sized sections. Bring the left section over your left shoulder, and the right section over your right shoulder. Your hair should look as though you are about to make two braids. For smaller, tighter curls, you can split your hair into smaller sections. It will take more time for you to complete the process, but it will result in tighter curls. Twist the left section onto a tight rope just behind your ear. Make sure that you are twisting it away from your face. Hold the rope at the end so that it doesn't unravel. If you have very long hair, you may need to position the rope right over your ear instead. Wrap the rope around the headband, towards the back of your head. Pull the rope up, then under the headband. Give it another twist, and wrap it around the headband again. Keep wrapping the rope around the headband until you run out of hair. Twist your hair after each wrap. You want it to be as tight and snug as possible. Repeat the process on the other side of your head. Twist the right section away from your face, then wrap it around the headband. Make sure that you are wrapping it upwards, just like you did for the left side. Keep the wraps nice and tight. Take a moment to tuck in any missed strands, especially if you have your hair cut into layers. Let your hair dry completely. This is very important. If you take your hair out of the headband too soon, the curls will come undone. Most people will need to wait overnight, but some people may need to wait longer, especially if they have very thick or long hair. Gently unwrap your hair and pull off the headband. Don't yank the headband off first, otherwise you risk undoing all your work. Instead, gently unwrap the ropes, starting from the back. Once you have your hair out of the headband, pull the headband off. Separate your hair with your fingers. After taking your hair out of the headband, you'll likely be left with two big curls, one on each side of your head. Use your fingers to gently loosen those two big curls into smaller ones. Don't use a brush or comb, or your hair will frizz up. Finish off with a texturizing spray and hairspray, if needed. Mist your hair with a texturizing spray.

Heat styling is fast, but it is harsh and can damage your hair overtime. Heat-less styling is much gentler. Depending on the style you want, you can get anything from loose, beachy waves to tight, springy curls. Braid your hair while it's damp for natural, beachy waves.
