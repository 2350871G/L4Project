Look online for the service in your local area, and make sure you dig away from the spaces that are marked. If you\u2019re putting up a new mailbox post to replace one already built into the ground, you should be OK to put the new post in the same spot as the old one. If you want to move it, you should get your utilities marked out. Make sure that you don\u2019t hit any lines running under your yard that aren\u2019t utilities, such as pipes running to sprinklers or wires leading to yard lights. These likely won\u2019t show up with a local service. In the United States, you can call 811 to get your utilities marked out for free within 2 days. Once they are marked, you will have 10 days to install your mailbox post in a safe area.
