There are several commercial options available, including diamond stones, ceramic stones, and whetstones. Whetstone: These stones are generally considered the easiest to use and are made from fine to coarse grit stone. You must soak your whetstone in cold, clean water for ten minutes before you sharpen your blade on it. Keep in mind that when a whetstone is used a lot, it often develops valleys or grooves where the knife is rubbed. Ceramic Stones: These stones must also be soaked in water before use, but for only three to five minutes. They are harder than whetstones which means that they will sharpen your blade faster. Ceramic stones generally last longer than whetstones but are a bit more challenging to use. Diamond stones: These stones come in several different levels of coarseness including hard, fine, and superfine. In many cases, diamond stones are actually metal plates with small diamonds attached to their surfaces. Some of the substrates have holes to capture the swarf, or sharpening debris. These stones are the hardest sharpening stones and will sharpen your blade the quickest. Keep in mind, that diamond stones are also by far the most expensive sharpening stone, but last the longest."

                    "description": "If you are using a whetstone or ceramic stone, you should soak the stone in the water for the correct amount of time. Knife sharpening experts also recommend using a lubricant such as mineral oil. You can buy this oil at your local hardware store. The purpose of lubricant is to prevent the stone's pores from clogging up with the swarf, filings and grit. It also reduces the heat caused by the friction that is created when the knife is rubbed on the stone. Too much heat can warp your blade. Sharpening or machine oil can be used with a whetstone or ceramic stone, and thinned dish washing soap is handy for use with a diamond stone."

                    "description": "The two most important parts of sharpening a blade are knowing to what angle to sharpen the blade, and to keep that angle as steady as possible during sharpening process. The blade of every knife is honed at a particular angle to suit the purpose of the knife. This is also called the rough grind angle. Most pocket knives have a bevel edge of 25 to 30 degrees. If you are wary of sharpening your knife without knowing the exact angle, you can go into your local knife shop for help, or call the manufacturer of the knife. You may also be able to find the specific bevel angle for your knife online."

Keep your hand steady and maintain the angle throughout the entire sharpening stroke. You may end up putting a rounded edge on the blade instead of a sharp edge. Holding your knife in the same position for a long period of time can be challenging. If this is your first time sharpening a knife, or you feel like your hands may not stay steady for long enough, you should consider buying a sharpening guide. Sharpening guides attach to the knife and hold it at a steady angle. Keep in mind that guides do not do very well with a curved blade."
