There are two levels of Kaufman cards: basic and advanced. Each is geared toward addressing specific speech sounds to help the child develop functional, expressive language. The Kaufman Treatment Kit 1 is considered the basic level, and is geared toward children between the ages of 2 and 8. It targets the synthesis of basic sounds, such as /m, t, b, d, h, n, w, and p/. The Kaufman Treatment Kit 2 is considered the advanced level, and is geared toward children between the ages of 4 and 10. It targets the synthesis of sounds such as /f, g, k, l, s, and sh/. It also blends /s, r, and l/ sounds. If you\u2019re choosing Kaufman cards to use at home, it\u2019s best to consult with a speech therapist.
