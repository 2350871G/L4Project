Make sure, however, that you have enough chips for each player. Give each player 3 chips to start. LCR is generally played with poker chips. If you don\u2019t have any poker chips, you can use any similarly-sized substitute, such as buttons or quarters. Just make sure that you have enough so that each player can begin the game with 3 chips or chip substitutes. Designate the numbers on the dice if you don\u2019t have retail LCR dice. To play LCR, you can buy and use the retail 6-sided LCR dice. If you don\u2019t have the retail LCR dice, you can use any regular 6-sided dice.

Choose a player to start the game. In LCR, the players determine who goes first. How you choose the first player is up to you. The first player could be the youngest player, oldest player, tallest player, shortest player, and so on. You could also have all the players roll the dice once, and the player who rolls the most dots gets to go first. Get the first player to roll the 3 game dice.

Continue with the game until one player acquires all the chips. Once all the players except for one have lost all their chips to other players or to the center pot, the player who still has chips left wins the game. Using LCR Game Variants Try LCR Wild to make the game more competitive. The rules of LCR Wild are the same as regular LCR, with just a few simple variations. On the retail version of LCR Wild, one of the dots on each dice is replaced with a W. If you are playing with regular dice, change one of the numbers that designates a dot to designate the W, such as the 1. Then, alter the regular LCR rules as follows:\nIf you roll a W (or 1 with regular dice), take 1 chip from any other player. If you roll 2 Ws, take 2 chips from 1 other player, or 1 chip each from 2 other players. If you roll 3 Ws, you instantly win the game. Play LCR Last Chip Wins to keep the game going. In LCR Last Chip Wins, players take turns and follow the same rules as regular LCR, but the winner is the last player to get rid of all of their chips into the center pot. Therefore, when a player has only 1 chip remaining, that player wins if they roll a C.\nIf a player only has 1 chip remaining and they do not roll a C, it is possible for that player to then have to take more chips if the player to their left rolls an R or the player to their right rolls an L in the next round. LCR Last Chip Wins can keep the game going longer because each player still has a chance to win as long as 1 player has at least 1 chip. Use the dots-to-win LCR variant to make winning more difficult. In this variant of LCR, the rules remain the same until only one player has any chips remaining. Instead of winning, this player must roll a dot on all 3 game dice. If they do not, the game continues until the only player with chips left rolls 3 dots. Choose your own stakes in LCR if you play where gambling is legal. To play LCR where you choose your own stakes, first assign a monetary value to each chip. Then, instead of automatically getting 3 chips at the beginning of the game, each player chooses how many chips they want to start and puts the equivalent amount of money in the center pot. The game then proceeds as normal, with the winner getting all the chips and money left in the center pot. For example, if all the players decide that each chip is worth $1, and you only want to gamble $2, then you will only take 2 chips to begin the game instead of 3.",
