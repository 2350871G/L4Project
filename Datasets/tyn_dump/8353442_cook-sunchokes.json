Sunchokes are somewhat tough and fibrous, so the heat needs to be pretty high to cook them all the way through. Get out a large pan or roasting dish that you can use to cook the sunchokes. Start prepping the sunchokes while the oven is preheating. You can also roast sunchokes and similar vegetables under a broiler, or wrapped in foil on a grill."

Since these vegetables grow in the ground, it\u2019s important to clean them thoroughly before you eat them. The size and shape of the sunchokes is largely up to you.

Add a pinch of kosher salt, a couple crushed cloves of garlic and a minced sprig of parsley or rosemary. For a sweeter touch, go with herbs like ginger, cloves and mint.

After the 15 minutes is up, poke one or two with a fork to see if they\u2019re sufficiently soft. The sunchokes will be done when the edges just begin to brown. There will be some variation in cook times for dense, temperamental veggies like sunchokes, so rely on your own senses to determine when they\u2019re done in addition to the timer you set.
