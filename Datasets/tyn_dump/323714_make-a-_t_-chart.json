Making a T Chart in Excel Label two top row, or horizontal, cells on your Excel sheet. Begin by taking the two subjects you would like to compare and filling them into two different cells in the top row of your excel spreadsheet. These top two cells will be the headings of your T chart. Consider making these two top cells bold so that you can distinguish them from the bulk of your data. If you choose to make this T chart into a graph, these two labels will be the labels of your axes. T charts can also be used to make T accounts as well as visualized graphs. Begin filling in the column, or vertical, cells underneath each row heading. Once you have labelled your row cells you will be able to begin filling out the column cells. Be sure that you are filling in column cells that correspond with their row cell heading. Just like when making a T chart on paper, you can use this Excel chart to list separate views on a given subject, strengths and weaknesses, or pros and cons. Make a graph. Once you have finished entering your data points you have the option of making a graph. Graphs in Excel allow you to visualize your T chart in ways that might make the information more appealing or understandable.",
