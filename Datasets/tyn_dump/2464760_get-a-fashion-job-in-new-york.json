Go into fashion production. You can opt to get a business degree at the bachelor level, and take some fashion merchandising or design classes. Production employees oversee the manufacturing of fashion and can rise high into the corporate levels. Go into fashion journalism or PR. If you have an entrepreneurial spirit and an ability to write and do some marketing, then these fields are a good way to work in fashion, although not necessarily for a clothing company. Get a degree in public relations or journalism and then start your own fashion blog to break into the industry. If you want to pursue fashion design, consider breaking away from womenswear.
