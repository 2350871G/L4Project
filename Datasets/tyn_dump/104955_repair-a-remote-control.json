Another good tool to have around is a wire brush, which can also be used in place of the sandpaper. When you\u2019re done, install new batteries and test the remote. Corroded terminals can\u2019t properly receive power from batteries, so cleaning them can make the remote work again. If it still doesn\u2019t work, you may need to buy a new one.",

        "If you have a hole punch, use it to create perfect circles that match the contacts.",
        "Otherwise, use a sharp pair of scissors.",
        "You can cut the foil into small squares that are about the same size as the contacts.",
        "If the foil is too big, it may get in the way of the other contacts or fail to fit inside the remote.",
        "You really can\u2019t make the foil too small, however.",
        "Glue the foil to the non-functioning contacts.",
        "Try using a contact adhesive, which is a very strong type of rubber cement.",
        "You may also have success with super glue or craft glue.",
        "Instead of squeezing the glue directly onto the contacts, dip the tip of something small, like a matchstick, into it.",
        "Use it to spread a thin but consistent layer of glue across each contact.",
        "While you can squeeze the glue onto the contacts, you will usually end up using too much of it.",
        "It can lead to a mess that is difficult to clean up.",
        "If you\u2019re having a hard time placing the foil on the contacts, use tweezers or another tool.",
        "Positioning the small squares by hand can be difficult.",
        "Wait at least 30 minutes for the glue to dry.",
        "Check the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for an exact recommendation.",
        "Contact adhesive and other glues you may use tend to dry relatively quickly.",
        "However, you may wish to leave the remote alone for longer to ensure the glue fully cures.",
        "Some super glues can take as long as 24 hours to cure.",
        "Set the remote parts out on a towel with the contacts up in the air.",
        "This will help the glue dry and also prevent the foil from coming off the contacts.",
        "Reassemble the remote and test it.",
        "Put the keypad back inside the casing.",
        "Refer to a picture or diagram of your remote to position any loose parts correctly.",

        "You can use a cotton swab to help spread the liquid around.",
        "If you don\u2019t see any signs of corrosion, you don\u2019t have to worry about neutralizing anything and can focus on cleaning the electrical contacts inside the battery chamber.",
        "You can mix in a little baking soda to clear stubborn spots of corrosion.",
        "Scrub away the corrosion using a cotton swab.",
        "An old toothbrush can also be helpful for removing the corrosion.",
        "Wipe the corrosion off the batteries first, then work on the battery chamber in the remote.",
        "When you\u2019re done, check it over for anything you missed.",
        "Sometimes the corrosion is very small and can be easy to overlook.",
        "Wipe the corrosion off onto a newspaper or sweep it into a garbage bag.",
        "Be careful to avoid spreading it throughout your home.",
        "If you need to, use a toothpick or pencil eraser to reach anything you can\u2019t remove with a cotton swab or toothbrush.",
        "Clear the electrical contacts with 150-grit sandpaper.",
        "If the contacts inside of the remote\u2019s battery chamber look dirty, clean them.",
