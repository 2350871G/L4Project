It will also create space and make it easier to work. Tap out the hinge pins with a screwdriver. The hinge pins are the metal bars that run inside of your hinge. Press the screwdriver tip to the bottom of the hinge pin and lightly tap the end of the screwdriver to push the pin up and out. If your hinge doesn't have a pin in it, skip to the next step. Old hinge pins may get stuck over time and will require extra force to remove. Unscrew the hinges from the door. Unscrew your hinges from your old door so that you can reuse them. Use a Phillip's head screwdriver to remove the screws in the hinge. Once they are unscrewed, set them aside. Hinges that don't have pins must be unscrewed before you can remove the door. Put the hinge screws in a ziplock bag so that you don't lose them. Open the door and remove it from the frame. Once your door is unscrewed from the hinges, you should be able to remove it from the door frame. Turn the doorknob, and carefully remove the door from the door frame. Place the door on a large flat surface. Remove the doorknob from the door. Remove your doorknob so you can use it on your new door. Unscrew the knob from the door and remove the internal components then set them aside. The doorknob hole should be empty when you're done. Cutting and Measuring Your New Door Place your old door on top of your new door and trace around it. If your new door is the same size as your old door, you don't have to cut it. If your new door is a different size, place it on top of your old door and line up the doorknob holes. Use a pencil to trace lines directly onto your new door. When you're done, your new door should have an outline that's the same size as your old door. If your new door is too small, you may need to purchase a new one, or there will be gaps in between the door frame and door. Cut your door if it's larger than your old door. Lift the old door off your new door and use a circular saw to cut it to size. Follow the traced line that you drew earlier. If you do it correctly, your new door should be the same size as your old door. Measure your door frame if your old door didn't fit. Measure the door frame's height and width with a tape measure, then write down the measurements. Subtract \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) on the width and \u20444 inch (1.9 cm) to the height of the door so that it can properly open and close. You can use this measurement to find a new door that fits perfectly. Attaching Hinges to Your New Door Place your old door over your new door. Your old door's edges should line up with the new door if they are the same size. If they aren't the same size, use sandpaper to work down the edges of your new door so that the edges of the doors run flush. Place your door in the doorframe if it's a different size than the old one. Line up the hinges on the door with the hinges on the wall. Get someone to help you hold the door in place as you mark the spot on the door where the hinges will line up. Mark the area where the hinges will go on the new door. Use a pencil to mark a line at the top and bottom of the hinge on the new door. Make sure this line is exact, or your hinges won't line up later. Place hinges over the marks that you made and trace around them. Trace around the rounded part on the top of the hinge. Leave \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) from the top of the hinge and edge of the door. Score the line with a utility knife or razor blade. Score around the traced line about \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) down into the wood of the door. Cutting into the tracing will help you cut out the mortise that your hinge will sit in when you attach it to the new door. Chisel the mortise. Carefully push your chisel into the scored lines you created and start to scrape out a mortise for your hinges to sit in. The mortise should be \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) deep so that your hinges don't stick out of the edge of the door. Sand or chisel the mortise until the hinge runs flush with the door. When you place the hinge in the mortise, the face of the hinge should run flush with the edge of the door. Use sandpaper or your chisel to continue working down the mortise until your hinge fits into it. Screw the new hinges into the mortise. Use the screws that fit in the hinge to attach it to the new door. You may have to use an electric screwdriver to drive the screws into the door. Attaching the New Door Hang the new door in the doorframe. Fit the teeth of the hinge on the door with the teeth of the hinge on the door frame. Have someone hold the door in place as you attach it to the door frame with screws. Screw in the hinges or reinsert your hinge pins. If your hinge has screws, use the same ones you removed to reattach the hinge to the door. If it has hinge pins, insert the pins into the interlocking teeth from the top of the hinge and tap them in with a hammer. Hammering in the hinge pins will attach the door to your door frame. Install your new door knob. Take your doorknob and place it into the doorknob hole. Secure it to both sides of the door with screws and make sure that it works properly. If you've done everything correctly, your new door should be installed!",
