Hook the lead rope to the bottom hook on the halter or bridle and leave about 1 foot (0.30 m) of slack at the end of the rope. It's easier to train a horse that is already comfortable being around you. You can calm it down by petting it and staying in a relaxed state. You should be standing close enough to touch the horse as you walk with it."

You should stay parallel to the horse's shoulder as you walk. You don't need to pull on the rope hard--even a small amount pressure will cause the horse to react. Round pens can be anywhere from 30 feet (9.1 m) feet in diameter. Lunge trainers will usually use a pen that's at least 60 feet (18 m) in diameter. Start getting the horse used to the round pen by walking it around the outside perimeter of the pen. Stop to allow the horse to sniff the pen as often as it wants.

Don't tire your horse out. The horse's natural instinct will be to run around the round pen. Most training sessions should last 15 minutes to an hour and should be used to train your horse and teach it commands, not to give it exercise or make it tired. Starting the Training Walk around the round pen on the left side of the horse. Walk alongside the horse, guiding it with the leader while your hand rests on its rear. Walk at a slow pace next to the left shoulder of the horse. Continue walking left until the horse is completely relaxed and trotting along at an even pace. The horse should not seem frightened or stressed. If the horse is nervous, keep walking with it until it gets used to the round pen.

For now, though, pull back on the leader slightly while saying \"whoa.\" Stay still when the horse stops, then continue walking again. If you're using a lead whip, you can lightly tap on the front of the horse's legs if it is not stopping. Start walking in the other direction with your horse after stopping. Say \"whoa\" and pull back on the leader. Then, take the leader and walk in the opposite direction so the horse turns around. You should still be positioned near the horse's shoulder, on the left side of the horse. Lightly pull on the leader and continue to walk with the horse in the other direction. Refining Your Technique Loosen the rope and stand in the center of the pen. Once the horse has the commands down, you can loosen your control over it. If the horse starts moving immediately, say \"whoa\" to make it stop. If it abides by your commands without you standing close to it, it's a good sign that it's learning. Form a triangle with your body, the horse, and the lead-line. You can naturally encourage the horse to move forward by standing in the rear of the horse. Your body, the horse, and the lead line should form the points of a triangle. Practice the commands while standing in the center of the pen.

This will relieve pressure on the horse and signal that he should come towards you. Once the horse gets to you, reward it by petting it on its nose.
