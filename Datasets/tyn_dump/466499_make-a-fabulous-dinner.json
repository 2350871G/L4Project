If you have more than 4 guests, consider a third option if you\u2019d like. Set up a cheese and cracker tray for a simple yet scrumptious snack. Grab a serving platter and place slices of cheese on top to make your display. Include options such as American, Swiss, pepper jack, brie, and bleu cheese, for instance. Then, spread 2-4 types of crackers across the tray as well. On average, serve 2-4 tbsp (30-60 g) of cheese per person. For example, great cheese and cracker pairings include extra sharp cheddar and club crackers, brie and crostini, and gouda and multigrain.

Prepare deviled eggs for a quick but exquisite dish. Place the eggs in a single layer inside your pot, and cover them with 3 inches (7.6 cm) of water. Select a medium-high heat, and bring the water to a boil. When the water boils, cover the pot and remove it from the heat. Let the eggs sit for 15 minutes, drain the water, and let them cool. Then, crack the shells and peel the eggs while holding them under running water. Next, slice each egg in half horizontally and take out the yellow yolks.

For a medium-well steak, cook it until the temperature is around 150 \u00b0F (66 \u00b0C). Serve your protein with side dishes such as potatoes, broccoli, and corn.
