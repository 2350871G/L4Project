You'll need a sanitized specimen cup to collect the urine, some antibacterial wet wipes, a roll of paper towels and a pair of latex or vinyl medical gloves. Your doctor will likely supply you with a specimen cup and medical gloves so you can collect a urine sample at home. Your doctor may also supply you with special wipes for this purpose. The wet wipes are to thoroughly clean your daughter's genitalia so no bacteria on her skin gets into her urine sample. Paper towels are a good idea to keep on hand to wipe up any urine spills and to dry your hands after washing."

Place your daughter on the toilet, with legs spread far apart and prepare to clean her. If you are able, before attempting to collect a urine sample, give your daughter a bath earlier in the day and wash her genitalia with soap and water. It's best not to rely on wet wipes entirely for cleaning. To trigger your daughter to  pee, give her lots of water or milk to drink after her bath.

Place the cup upside down on a clean paper towel while you're waiting to collect the urine sample. If you don't have a sanitized collection cup from your doctor, boil a small glass jar and lid for about 10 minutes. Allow the jar and lid to air dry in a clean place before using it."
