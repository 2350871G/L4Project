Generally, you will want all of your IVs to be 31, but sometimes this is not necessary. For instance you will not need perfect special attack IVs on a Pok\u00e9mon that doesn't know special attacks. The best way to get perfect IVs is to breed Pok\u00e9mon that you already know has some good IVs. You can find out what your IVs are by speaking to a stats judge NPC and/or using an IV calculator."
