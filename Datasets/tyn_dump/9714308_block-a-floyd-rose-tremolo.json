Use your guitar string cutter to clip of the curly frayed ends of each string. Press your strings down through the bridge until they poke out the back. Pull on the bottom end of each string and slide it all the way through the bridge. Some technicians advocate for removing the strings, while others do not. Removing the strings from the guitar removes tension from your tremolo. This can make it easier to fit the block into the tremolo opening. Performing this modification with the strings still attached keeps the tremolo in your natural playing position. If you install the block without moving the tremolo, your guitar will be ready to play as soon as you close the back cavity."

Creating Your Block Measure the open space below the tremolo. Locate the space that sits just below the tremolo (between the spring block and the back of the body cavity). This space is bordered on 1 side by the tremolo itself, and on the other 3 sides by the body cavity. Use a ruler to measure the width and depth of this opening. Write these numbers down.

You are going to create a small block of wood that will fit in the opening below your tremolo. Start with a 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick wooden plank. Use a ruler and a permanent marker to mark the correct width and depth. Use a hand saw to cut your plank of wood. Place your plank of wood on a flat surface, with the portion you plan to cut first pointing up. Steady your plank of wood with your non-dominant hand. Place the sharp side of your saw on the wood, and begin sawing with a backward motion. Move the saw back and forth until you\u2019ve made the cut. Turn your plank and cut the other side.

If the block you created is slightly too large, you can also use sandpaper to make it a little smaller. 220-grit sandpaper will also work. Installing The Block Slip the block into the space under the tremolo. Your wooden block should drop right into the space below your tremolo. If it is too big, you can sand it down a little more. Tighten the 2 screws at the top of the tremolo just slightly. Use your Phillips screwdriver. You want these screws to be secure, but you still want slack from the tremolo strings to put pressure down on your block. Restring your guitar if you removed the strings.

Use a string cutter to remove the excess string, and wind your guitar strings until they have good tension. You will need to tune your guitar after this. Close up the cavity cover and replace the screws. Place the cavity cover on the back of your guitar. Locate your screwdriver and 6 screws.
