If you\u2019re using thin slices or diced pancetta, you can cook them as is. To cook rolled pancetta, you\u2019ll have to do a bit of slicing and possibly dicing. You can cut thick, 0.25 in (0.64 cm) slices from the roll to cook. Or, cut thick slices and then dice them into 0.25 in (0.64 cm) cubes."

Use your eyes and your nose to know when it\u2019s done just right for your liking. Thick (0.25 in (0.64 cm)) slices need to cook for about 5 minutes per side. If you\u2019re cooking a package of very thin (often paper-thin) slices, aim for 2-3 minutes per side. 0.25 in (0.64 cm) cubes take about 5 minutes total to cook and should be stirred around every couple minutes."
