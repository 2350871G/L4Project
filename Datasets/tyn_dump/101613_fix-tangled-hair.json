Always work through tangles with a wide-toothed comb, especially if you\u2019re detangling wet hair. Start below the knot and gently work your way up until it is completely loosened. Go slowly and be patient. Vigorous combing can make tangles even worse. When combing tangled hair, always start at the ends and work your way up toward the roots. If you deal with tangles frequently, consider getting a detangling brush. They are specifically designed to painlessly remove knots from your hair. Detangling brushes are great for detangling dry hair, but wide-toothed combs are almost always the best option for detangling wet hair."
