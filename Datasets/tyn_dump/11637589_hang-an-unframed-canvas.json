You'll place the wire between the left and right stretcher bars so the nail catches on it. Screw 2 eye hooks onto the back of the painting, positioning them on the inside of each canvas stretcher bar, roughly a third of the way down, so that they\u2019re pointing towards one another. Attach a piece of wire to the hooks to hang the canvas from the wire. The stretcher bars are what the canvas is stretched across to keep it taut and in place. Make sure the hooks are level with one another so the wire is even. Look for eye hooks and wire for hanging canvas at your local hardware store or art store. Check to be sure the piece of wire isn\u2019t too long by pulling up on it when it\u2019s tied to the hooks. If it reaches above the top of the canvas, it\u2019s too long."

Apply washi tape to light canvas to hold it on the wall. Washi tape is a fun way to attach art to a wall, though the canvas needs to be lightweight and thin for the tape to be able to hold it in place. Choose washi tape in a color or design of your choice before taping it along each edge of the canvas so it\u2019s attached to the wall.

Attach a dowel to the canvas to hang it on the wall using rope or thread. Use hot glue to attach the top and bottom side of the canvas to dowels. Tie a piece of yarn, string, or rope to the top dowel on either end so you can hang it on the wall. Hammer a nail into the wall or pin a tack to hang the canvas evenly. Attaching a dowel to the bottom end as well as the top is important so that the canvas falls flat against the wall.",
