        "A plastic cup or small aquarium scoop may be helpful in transferring the gravel into the aquarium.",
        "Cover the baseplate and any exposed aquarium bottom completely with about 2 inches (5.1 cm) of gravel.",
        "Try to keep the baseplate centered and avoid letting gravel get underneath the baseplate or inside the bubbler housing tube.",
        "If the gravel is new and unused, you won't need to rinse it before depositing it on top of the baseplate.",
        "Use about 2 pounds (0.91 kg) of gravel for every 1 gallon (3.8 L) of aquarium.",
        "Deposit the gravel gingerly inside the aquarium tank so that the gravel doesn\u2019t scratch the sides of the aquarium.",
        "Finishing Setup and Cleaning the Filter Situate the aquarium and add decor inside the tank.",
        "At this point, the aquarium must be placed in its permanent location.",
        "So, make sure it\u2019s located on a shelf or tabletop with a nearby outlet so you can plug in and power the air pump.",
        "Once the aquarium is in place, rinse and install any rocks, novelty items, or plants you\u2019d like to be in the tank.",
        "Only place an aquarium on sturdy furniture that can withstand the weight of a full aquarium; water is deceptively heavy.",
        "Some aquarium hobbyists place a towel or padding on top of their aquarium furniture before placing the aquarium on top to help keep the aquarium level and absorb any droplets that may splash out and roll down the outer surface of the aquarium.",
        "Fill the aquarium with fresh, clean, dechlorinated water.",
        "Purchase the necessary amount of dechlorinated water from a supermarket.",
        "While you\u2019re pouring the water into the aquarium, use patience and pour slowly so that the items in the tank aren\u2019t disturbed as you pour.",
        "Fill the tank with the recommended amount of water.",
        "For example, pour 30 gallons (110 L) of water into a 30 US gal (110 L) tank.",
        "Try not to disturb your decor or expose the UGF baseplate.",
        "It should remain covered by gravel once you\u2019re done pouring in the water.",
        "If anything is moved out of place, after the tank is filled, reach 1 arm in and re-position the item.",
        "Depending on the type of fish you have, you\u2019ll also need to adjust the temperature of the water as well as its ammonia and pH levels.",
        "Plug in the air pump to the wall outlet.",
        "When you plug the pump in, make sure to leave a \"drip-loop\": a section of hanging cord that prevents water droplets from rolling down the electrical cord and reaching the outlet.",
        "With a drip-loop in the cord, any water will accumulate at the lowest point of the loop and drop from there onto the floor.",
        "You will hear a gurgling sound as air begins to travel through the tubing into the air stone inside the aquarium.",
        "If installed correctly, a column of bubbles should form inside the plastic bubbler housing within a few seconds.",
        "This indicates that the UGF installation is complete.",
        "If you don't see a column of bubbles, check the components of the bubbler tube and make sure everything is snugly assembled.",
        "Add your fish back into the filtered fish tank.",
        "If you removed your fish prior to installing the filter, now is the time to deposit them back into the tank.",
        "Pick up the container that your fish are swimming in and hold it low over the surface of the water in the tank.",
        "Scoop the fish up one by one and gently deposit them in the water.",
        "Then, pour out the excess water from the container.",
        "Alternatively, you can avoid this entire process if you set up the undergravel filter before you purchase and bring home fish from the pet store.",
        "Change 1/4 of the water in the tank weekly to keep the UGF working.",
        "Since undergravel filters work by pulling water\u2014and the impurities that build up in the tank\u2014down through the gravel, it\u2019s important that both water and gravel remain clean.",
        "So, once a week, use a large bucket and piece of tubing to siphon out roughly half of the water in the tank.",
        "Replace the amount you removed with clean water.",
        "Make sure that you\u2019re using dechlorinated, temperature-appropriate water so you don\u2019t harm your fish.",
        "If you\u2019d prefer to fill the tank with tap water, you can purchase a dechlorinating agent from your local supermarket.",
        "This will remove chlorine from the water and make it safe for fish.",
        "Siphon grime off of the gravel every time you change the water.",
        "If leftover food, fish excrement, and organic detritus are left to build up on the bottom of the tank, they\u2019ll soon clog up the UGF.",
        "Clean off the underwater gravel by using a piece of plastic piping to siphon the organic detritus off of the bottom of the tank.",
        "When finished, you\u2019ll have a bucket full of dirty water.",
        "Empty this into a toilet or use it to water indoor and outdoor plants."
