Having a fever of up to 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit (or 39 degrees Celsius) is nothing to worry about, but anything over this level requires immediate evaluation by a doctor. If you are experiencing discomfort from the fever or have a fever of over 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit, there are several ways to reduce it. Certain over-the-counter pain killers can be taken to reduce a fever. Take acetaminophen (Tylenol, paracetamol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or aspirin in its recommended dosage. Aspirin should not be giving to children or teenagers because it can cause Reye's syndrome, a potentially fatal condition. Only give Tylenol (acetaminophen) to children. Consult with your doctor before giving any medication to a child under the age of 2. Seek professional medical help if your fever stays consistently above 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit, does not respond to medication, or lasts for longer than 3 days. Consult your doctor immediately if your infant has a fever over 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit."

Decongestants typically come in pill form (Sudafed, Sudafed PE, which require an ID to purchase and are kept behind the counter) or as nasal sprays (Afrin).

It may also cause drowsiness or cause difficulty sleeping. Do not use nasal sprays for more than 3 days in a row. Do not take an antihistamine for congestion unless your congestion is caused by allergies. Many people mistake seasonal allergies for a cold. If your congestion is accompanied by itchy eyes and frequent sneezing, it is possible you have seasonal allergies and should take an antihistamine.

        "You should get at least 7-9 hours of sleep each night, and even more when you are sick.",
        "Take time off of work or school if possible to allow your body to rest and recover.",

        "Washing your hands is one of the best ways to keep germs from spreading.",
        "To wash your hands properly, wet your hands, apply soap, then work the soap into a lather by rubbing your hands together.",

        "Apply the amount directed by the product label and rub the product all over your hands and fingers until dry.",
        "Cough or sneeze into a tissue or the crook of your arm, not into the air.",
        "Cold viruses can be spread through the air.",

        "Limit the spread of those viruses by containing your cough or sneeze.",
        "Avoid close contact with others when you or they are sick.",
        "Don\u2019t hug, kiss, or shake hands when you or the other person has a cold.",
        "This can increase the chances of transmission from one person to another.",
        "Also don\u2019t share drinking straws or eating utensils, such as forks and spoons with someone who is sick.",
        "Disinfect frequently touched surfaces like doorknobs, TV remotes, and children\u2019s toys.",
        "Use a disinfecting cleaner spray and disposable paper towels or disinfecting wipes to clean these items thoroughly.",
        "Cold viruses can live on surfaces for up to 24 hours, so cleaning them frequently helps limit the transmission from person to person."
