        "Spray it lightly with lubricant once you have a clean surface.",
        "A 2 oz (57 g) bar of clay should last for 3-4 \u201cclayings\u201d before it\u2019s overloaded with contaminants.",
        "However, once you can\u2019t find a clean surface in the clay, it\u2019s time to discard it.",
        "If you spot a larger piece of contamination in the clay, pick it out with your fingers, then fold the clay over.",
        "Always discard the clay if you drop it on the ground.",
        "It will pick up too many large pieces of debris to be useful.",
        "Spray and \"clay\" an adjacent section that overlaps the first.",
        "Your second 2 ft \u00d7 2 ft (61 cm \u00d7 61 cm) section should overlap the first by several inches/centimeters.",
        "Spray it liberally with lubricant, and add a bit of lubricant to the clean section of your clay disc.",
        "Then, as before, rub the clay very gently over the new section in either an up-and-down or side-to-side motion.",
        "Check your clay disc regularly for built-up debris, and fold it over to create a clean surface as needed.",
        "When the clay stops picking up contaminants, wipe the excess lubricant off the car with a clean microfiber cloth.",
        "Continue \"claying\" the car section by section until the job is done.",
        "Keep overlapping each new section over the previous one by several inches/centimeters, and keep checking your clay disc regularly for excess contaminant buildup.",
        "If you can no longer create a clean clay surface, grab a new clay bar to finish the job.",

        "\"Clay\" your car again when contaminants build up on the surface.",
        "If you're using a fine grade clay bar, you can clean your car with it as often as monthly.",
        "Limit \"claying\" with medium grade bars to 1-2 times per year, though, in order to protect the car's finish.",
        "If it's not exposed to excessive amounts of contamination, you may need to \"clay\" a car that's kept outside 4 times per year.",
        "A car that's kept in a garage most of the time may only need \"clayed\" 1-2 times per year."
