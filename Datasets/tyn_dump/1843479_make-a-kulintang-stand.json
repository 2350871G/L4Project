    "text": " Disambiguation Note that the terminology in this article is Maguindanaon. There are dozens of cultures indigenous to the islands of Mindanao, the Sulu Archipelago, and Borneo, and each culture has its own name for the kulintang set and for the kulintang stand. Likewise, each culture has its own traditional style of playing these instruments. The Maguindanaon people use an eight-gong set (the \"kulintang\" gongs) which is laid upon a wooden stand (the \"antangan\"). These instructions are for the most basic and simple kulintang stand. A kulintang instrument is composed of both the kulintang gongs and the antangan. The antangan is the resonator for the kulintang gongs. Measuring the gongs You will need to take careful measurements with the set of gongs in order to determine the exact sizes of wood you will need to make the stand.  Lay the gongs in a straight line on a padded level surface, such as a carpeted floor, or a towel on a tabletop. The largest (#1) gong should be at the far left, then the next largest gong, then the next, etc., until the smallest gong (#8) is at the end, at the far right. There should be about a one inch space between each gong, as they sit in a straight row. Note that the widest part of the gong is at the top edge, not at the base of the gong, so the space between the bases of two adjacent gongs will be more than one inch wide. Once the gongs are placed in row with about one inch space between each gong, measure the length of the set of kulintang gongs. Measure from the outside edge of the #1 (largest) gong to the other side of the #8 (smallest) gong. Typically, the length will be approximately 4 to 5 feet (approximately 1.2 to 1.5 meters). Add two inches to your measurement, and that will be the inside lengthwise dimension (Measurement \"L\") for the antangan. Measure the diameter of the #1 (largest) gong. Add two inches to your measurement, and that will be the inside width (Measurement \"W\") for the antangan. You may use any type of sturdy wood for the basic antangan frame. #*There is no standard size for kulintang gongs, nor is there a standard size of wood for the antangan. You will need two long pieces, and two short pieces. Feel free to use recycled wood. The two long pieces should each have a length equal to Measurement \"L\" plus an additional two inches. The width should be about \u20444 inch (1.9 cm). The height should be about 8 inches (20.3 cm). The two short pieces should have one dimension equal to Measurement \"W\". The width should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm). The other dimension should be about 30 inches (76.2 cm), as the end pieces of the antangan will also serve as legs. When the kulintang gongs are placed on the antangan, the kulintang should be easily played by a person sitting on a standard-size stool or armless-chair. Building the stand Take one of the short pieces of wood at the end and place it along the inside of one of the 8-inch surfaces of the long pieces of wood. #*The first 8 inches (20.3 cm) of the 30-inch piece of wood (the short piece) will be alongside the long piece of wood, and at a 90-degree angle. # Place the two pieces on the floor, with the 22-inch long \"leg\" pointing away from the ground, and carefully screw in three of the wood screws. Each screw will enter into the long piece of wood at about 1/2-inch from the end and along the 8-inch surface, then all the way through the 3/4-inch surface of the long piece, then into the 1-inch surface of the short piece. Attach the other short piece to the other end of the long piece.  Attach the other long piece to the assembly.  Turn the frame upside down, so that the two end legs are on the ground and the 8-inch \"box\" is at the top.  Making the separators First, screw in the cup hooks, two at each end of the frame, at the top of the short pieces. Divide the space at the end (the width) into thirds, and screw a cup hook at the point that is 1/3, and another at the point that is 2/3. Do the same for the other end. The hooks should be positioned so that the open part of the hook faces away from the center of the frame. Measure out the cotton or nylon cord so that it is about 12 inches (30.5 cm) plus lengthwise measurement plus width plus another lengthwise measurement plus width.  Cut the cord, and use the cup hooks to guide the cord into a long rectangle.  Pull the cord taut and tie it into a \"circle\" -- a rectangular-shaped circle.  Measure out two or three more pieces of cord, about 12 inches (30.5 cm) long.  Eyeball the cord rectangle, and at the halfway point of the length, tie a piece of cord which is loose enough to not affect the distance between the two long ends of the cord rectangle, but tight enough that it will prevent the two long ends from spreading apart.  Do the same at the quarter-point, and again at the three-quarter point of the cord-length.  Carefully place the largest gong on the cord rectangle, with a space of about 1 inch (2.5 cm) between the left interior of the antangan frame and the top rim of the gong.  UNDER the cord rectangle, and at about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the right side of the top rim of the gong, place the end of the 48-inch-long \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) X \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) wood flush against the outer edge of the long piece of wood, and use a pencil to mark on the wood where it crosses the other outer edge of the other long piece of wood. Make sure that the cord or string is above the wood separators. Cut the wood, and leave it on the top of the frame of the antangan.  Remove the gong, and then place the next largest gong on the antangan. Note that the cord must rest lightly above the wood separators, and should not be tied to any of the separators. Measure and cut the next separator, to the right of that gong. Continue until there are nine separators that have been cut, to go between and on either end of the eight gongs. Once those nine separators have been cut, measure and cut two additional separators, one for each of the two far ends of the frame. These last separators will act as spacers, and will rest very close to the cup hooks at each end. Use of those last two separators/spacers may be optional, depending on the fit of the gongs on the antangan. Using a permanent marker such as a Sharpie, mark the separators as follows: 0 for the one furthest to the left, 1 for the one to the right, etc., to the end at the far right which should be marked 9. The wide far-left separator/spacer and the narrow far-right separator/spacer need not be marked. If you anticipate using just that set of gongs with that antangan, you can mark on the antangan frame where each of the separators will be located. You can either use a Sharpie, a pencil, or attach a sticky Velcro dot. If you really don't expect to ever use another kulintang set with that antangan, after you have used the gongs a few times with the antangan, and you are comfortable with the placement of the separators, you can nail the separators into the frame Place all eight gongs on the cord rectangle, with the wood separators providing support at the ends and in-between each gong. Each gong must not touch anything other than the cords upon which it is suspended. If the gong touches a wood separator, or another gong, or a side of the frame, the gong will be dampened (it will go \"clunk\" when played) or it could even be damaged! If the gongs are touching anything other than the cords upon which they are suspended, if they are touching each other or touching the frame, the gongs cannot be played, and can only be displayed. Note that the cords should be above the wood separators, not under the wood separators, and the cords are should not be tied around the wood separators. Kulintang Beaters Be sure you have proper kulintang beaters. Do not use anything harder than Balsa Wood. Pine wood is too hard! You will crack the gongs if you don't use the right kind of wood beaters. Kulintang beaters made in the Philippines are made from two kinds of tropical wood not found in the Western Hemisphere.  If you are in the U.S. and do not have proper kulintang beaters, go to Ace Hardware and find a nice 36-inch long piece of 1-inch X 1-inch balsa wood (used by train hobbyists).  Cut the balsa into pieces about 16 inches (40.6 cm) long, and take away the straight/square edges with an Exacto knife with a concave edge.  Use thin-mil package tape, or 3M Transparent tape, to cover the balsa wood, to give the sticks durability.  Now, you just need a stool or armless chair, and you are ready to play! ",

        " Disambiguation Note that the terminology in this article is Maguindanaon.",
        "There are dozens of cultures indigenous to the islands of Mindanao, the Sulu Archipelago, and Borneo, and each culture has its own name for the kulintang set and for the kulintang stand.",
        "Likewise, each culture has its own traditional style of playing these instruments.",
        "The Maguindanaon people use an eight-gong set (the \"kulintang\" gongs) which is laid upon a wooden stand (the \"antangan\").",
        "These instructions are for the most basic and simple kulintang stand.",
        "A kulintang instrument is composed of both the kulintang gongs and the antangan.",
        "The antangan is the resonator for the kulintang gongs.",
        "Measuring the gongs You will need to take careful measurements with the set of gongs in order to determine the exact sizes of wood you will need to make the stand.",
        "Lay the gongs in a straight line on a padded level surface, such as a carpeted floor, or a towel on a tabletop.",
        "The largest (#1) gong should be at the far left, then the next largest gong, then the next, etc., until the smallest gong (#8) is at the end, at the far right.",
        "There should be about a one inch space between each gong, as they sit in a straight row.",
        "Note that the widest part of the gong is at the top edge, not at the base of the gong, so the space between the bases of two adjacent gongs will be more than one inch wide.",
        "Once the gongs are placed in row with about one inch space between each gong, measure the length of the set of kulintang gongs.",
        "Measure from the outside edge of the #1 (largest) gong to the other side of the #8 (smallest) gong.",
        "Typically, the length will be approximately 4 to 5 feet (approximately 1.2 to 1.5 meters).",
        "Add two inches to your measurement, and that will be the inside lengthwise dimension (Measurement \"L\") for the antangan.",
        "Measure the diameter of the #1 (largest) gong.",
        "Add two inches to your measurement, and that will be the inside width (Measurement \"W\") for the antangan.",
        "You may use any type of sturdy wood for the basic antangan frame.",
        "#*There is no standard size for kulintang gongs, nor is there a standard size of wood for the antangan.",
        "You will need two long pieces, and two short pieces.",
        "Feel free to use recycled wood.",
        "The two long pieces should each have a length equal to Measurement \"L\" plus an additional two inches.",
        "The width should be about \u20444 inch (1.9 cm).",
        "The height should be about 8 inches (20.3 cm).",
        "The two short pieces should have one dimension equal to Measurement \"W\".",
        "The width should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm).",
        "The other dimension should be about 30 inches (76.2 cm), as the end pieces of the antangan will also serve as legs.",
        "When the kulintang gongs are placed on the antangan, the kulintang should be easily played by a person sitting on a standard-size stool or armless-chair.",
        "Building the stand Take one of the short pieces of wood at the end and place it along the inside of one of the 8-inch surfaces of the long pieces of wood.",
        "#*The first 8 inches (20.3 cm) of the 30-inch piece of wood (the short piece) will be alongside the long piece of wood, and at a 90-degree angle.",
        "# Place the two pieces on the floor, with the 22-inch long \"leg\" pointing away from the ground, and carefully screw in three of the wood screws.",
        "Each screw will enter into the long piece of wood at about 1/2-inch from the end and along the 8-inch surface, then all the way through the 3/4-inch surface of the long piece, then into the 1-inch surface of the short piece.",
        "Attach the other short piece to the other end of the long piece.",
        "Attach the other long piece to the assembly.",
        "Turn the frame upside down, so that the two end legs are on the ground and the 8-inch \"box\" is at the top.",
        "Making the separators First, screw in the cup hooks, two at each end of the frame, at the top of the short pieces.",
        "Divide the space at the end (the width) into thirds, and screw a cup hook at the point that is 1/3, and another at the point that is 2/3.",
        "Do the same for the other end.",
        "The hooks should be positioned so that the open part of the hook faces away from the center of the frame.",
        "Measure out the cotton or nylon cord so that it is about 12 inches (30.5 cm) plus lengthwise measurement plus width plus another lengthwise measurement plus width.",
        "Cut the cord, and use the cup hooks to guide the cord into a long rectangle.",
        "Pull the cord taut and tie it into a \"circle\" -- a rectangular-shaped circle.",
        "Measure out two or three more pieces of cord, about 12 inches (30.5 cm) long.",
        "Eyeball the cord rectangle, and at the halfway point of the length, tie a piece of cord which is loose enough to not affect the distance between the two long ends of the cord rectangle, but tight enough that it will prevent the two long ends from spreading apart.",
        "Do the same at the quarter-point, and again at the three-quarter point of the cord-length.",
        "Carefully place the largest gong on the cord rectangle, with a space of about 1 inch (2.5 cm) between the left interior of the antangan frame and the top rim of the gong.",
        "UNDER the cord rectangle, and at about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the right side of the top rim of the gong, place the end of the 48-inch-long \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) X \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) wood flush against the outer edge of the long piece of wood, and use a pencil to mark on the wood where it crosses the other outer edge of the other long piece of wood.",
        "Make sure that the cord or string is above the wood separators.",
        "Cut the wood, and leave it on the top of the frame of the antangan.",
        "Remove the gong, and then place the next largest gong on the antangan.",
        "Note that the cord must rest lightly above the wood separators, and should not be tied to any of the separators.",
        "Measure and cut the next separator, to the right of that gong.",
        "Continue until there are nine separators that have been cut, to go between and on either end of the eight gongs.",
        "Once those nine separators have been cut, measure and cut two additional separators, one for each of the two far ends of the frame.",
        "These last separators will act as spacers, and will rest very close to the cup hooks at each end.",
        "Use of those last two separators/spacers may be optional, depending on the fit of the gongs on the antangan.",
        "Using a permanent marker such as a Sharpie, mark the separators as follows: 0 for the one furthest to the left, 1 for the one to the right, etc., to the end at the far right which should be marked 9.",
        "The wide far-left separator/spacer and the narrow far-right separator/spacer need not be marked.",
        "If you anticipate using just that set of gongs with that antangan, you can mark on the antangan frame where each of the separators will be located.",
        "You can either use a Sharpie, a pencil, or attach a sticky Velcro dot.",
        "If you really don't expect to ever use another kulintang set with that antangan, after you have used the gongs a few times with the antangan, and you are comfortable with the placement of the separators, you can nail the separators into the frame Place all eight gongs on the cord rectangle, with the wood separators providing support at the ends and in-between each gong.",
        "Each gong must not touch anything other than the cords upon which it is suspended.",
        "If the gong touches a wood separator, or another gong, or a side of the frame, the gong will be dampened (it will go \"clunk\" when played) or it could even be damaged!",
        "If the gongs are touching anything other than the cords upon which they are suspended, if they are touching each other or touching the frame, the gongs cannot be played, and can only be displayed.",
        "Note that the cords should be above the wood separators, not under the wood separators, and the cords are should not be tied around the wood separators.",
        "Kulintang Beaters Be sure you have proper kulintang beaters.",
        "Do not use anything harder than Balsa Wood.",
        "Pine wood is too hard!",
        "You will crack the gongs if you don't use the right kind of wood beaters.",
        "Kulintang beaters made in the Philippines are made from two kinds of tropical wood not found in the Western Hemisphere.",
        "If you are in the U.S. and do not have proper kulintang beaters, go to Ace Hardware and find a nice 36-inch long piece of 1-inch X 1-inch balsa wood (used by train hobbyists).",
