Place a large, heavy-bottomed pot on your camping stove. Add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil and 4 chicken breasts with the skin and bone still in place, and heat them over medium-high until the chicken is golden brown, which should take 2 to 3 minutes per side. For the most flavorful dish, season both sides of the chicken breasts with salt and pepper before you brown them. Mix in the red pepper and saute until it is soft. Once the chicken is golden brown, add 1 red pepper that\u2019s been julienned to the pot. Allow the pepper to cook until it becomes soft, which should take 1 to 2 minutes. You can substitute yellow peppers for the red if you prefer. Stir in the sun dried tomatoes and rice and cook until the rice browns. When the pepper is soft, add \u00bc cup (60 ml) of chopped, sun dried tomatoes and 1 \u00bd cups (350 ml) of Arborio rice to the pot. Mix well to combine them with the other ingredients, and cook the mixture for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the rice is slightly browned. You can substitute olives for the sun dried tomatoes if you prefer. You can substitute another short-grain rice for the Arborio if you prefer. Add the stock and bring the mixture to a boil. Once the rice is slightly browned, pour 3 cups (700 ml) of chicken stock to the pot. Allow the mixture to come to a boil, which should take 5 to 7 minutes. Cook the mixture until the chicken and rice are cooked through. When the mixture has come to a boil, lower the heat to medium-low. Continue cooking the mixture until the chicken is cooked through and the rice is tender, which should take approximately 25 to 35 minutes. Be sure to stir the mixture occasionally as it cooks so the rice doesn\u2019t stick to the pot. Garnish the dish with parsley and season with salt and pepper before serving. When the chicken and rice are finished cooking, remove the pot from the stove. Sprinkle some parsley and salt and pepper to taste over the dish, and serve while it\u2019s warm. If you prefer, you can substitute basil for the parsley. Whipping Up One Pot Pasta Heat the olive oil in the pot. Place a large pot on your camping stove, and add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil. Allow the oil to heat on medium-high until it begins to shimmer, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes. Saute the onions until translucent. Once the oil is heated, add 1 small, minced onion to the pot. Let the onion cook until it is translucent, which should take 1 to 3 minutes. Mix in the garlic powder and cook until the mixture is fragrant. When the onion is translucent, add \u00bc teaspoon (1 g) of garlic powder to the mixture. Stir well, and let the mixture cook until it is fragrant, which should take approximately 1 minute.If you prefer, you can use 2 minced cloves of garlic in place of the garlic powder. Stir in the tomatoes, broth, basil, Italian seasoning, and pasta. After the mixture has become fragrant, add a 14.5-ounce (411 g) can of diced tomatoes, a 14.5-ounce (411 g) can of chicken broth, \u00bd tablespoon (1 g) of dried basil, 1 tablespoon (6 g) of Italian seasoning, and \u00bd pound (227 g) of pasta to the pot. Mix well to ensure that all of the ingredients are combined. You can use any type of pasta that you like for the dish. Don\u2019t worry if the liquid doesn\u2019t cover the pasta completely right away. As it cooks, the sauce will thicken and cover the pasta. Cover the pot and allow it to come to a boil. Once the ingredients are mixed, place the lid on the pot. Allow the mixture to come to a boil, which should take 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the lid and cook the pasta until it\u2019s al dente. When the mixture has come to a boil, take the lid off the pot. Continue to cook the mixture until the pasta is tender but still has some bite. The best way to determine if the pasta is done cooking is to taste it and see if you are happy with the texture. Divide the pasta between two bowls and top with cheese and basil. Once the pasta is finished cooking, spoon the pasta into two bowls. Top the bowls with a handful of parmesan cheese and fresh basil, and serve while it\u2019s still warm.",
