Sign up for a fitness test with a personal trainer at the gym, if you are unsure where you are weak. They can test your aerobic and strength and give you some areas to work on. Set strength and aerobic goals. These will keep your workouts on track and allow you to hit milestones as you change your body's shape.

Weightlifting Start with weight machines. Learn proper form in this easy to use format first, if you have never lifted weights before.

Target muscle groups on different days. For example, do arms and shoulders on Monday, legs and abs on Tuesday and chest and back on Wednesday. Never work the same areas 2 days in a row. Work your target muscle groups to fatigue. You should reach muscle exhaustion in those groups when you stop lifting. You will build muscle quickly and get buff faster. Increase the weight you lift every 3 weeks. Increase in increments of 5 to 10 lbs. (2.2 to 4.5kg). Start lifting free weights as soon you know how to do proper form. Make sure your body does not sway. Lifting weights without the help of machines can build muscle faster, and it can also be combined with work on weight machines. Cardio Routines Add 20 to 30 minutes of cardio exercise 3 to 4 times per week. You will look buffer if you melt off some of the fat on your body. It is difficult to do this with strength training alone. Try interval training. Do 1 to 2 minutes of sprinting, followed by 4 to 5 minutes of moderate intensity exercise. Intervals increase the efficiency of your metabolism, burning more fat. If you choose to do interval training, you will get the same or more benefit in a 20 or 30 minute period of exercise as you would doing 45 minutes to 1 hour of work at the same moderate intensity. Try several cardio machines or sports. Do running, swimming, cycling, speed walking, elliptical and rowing, so that you work different muscles and avoid overtraining.
