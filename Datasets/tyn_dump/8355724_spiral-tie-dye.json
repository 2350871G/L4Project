        "Mix the dye with the amount of water recommended on the package.",
        "Each brand of dye will require a different amount of water.",
        "If your fiber reactive dye came in a plastic squeeze bottle, you'll most likely have to fill the bottle to the fill line with water.",
        "Again, read the instructions.",
        "If your dye came in a packet, mix the dye in a jar first, then transfer it into a plastic squeeze bottle.",
        "Some dyes can be mixed ahead of time and stored indefinitely while others need to be used immediately.",
        "Read the instructions on your package of dye.",
        "Soaking and Dyeing the Fabric Soak the shirt in the soda ash solution for 10 to 20 minutes.",
        "Dunk the shirt into the soda ash solution, then squeeze it to ensure that it's thoroughly soaked.",
        "Leave it in the bucket for 10 to 20 minutes.",
        "If the shirt floats in the water, it's not soaked through.",
        "Squeeze it some more, or allow it to soak longer.",
        "You can remove the dust mask at this point since the soda ash and dye powders are dissolved.",
        "You should keep the gloves and old clothes/apron on, however.",
        "Take the shirt out and squeeze out the excess soda ash solution.",
        "After this, you won\u2019t need the soda ash solution again, so dump it out.",
        "If you\u2019re dyeing more shirts, however, leave it in the bucket and soak the rest of your desired items.",
        "You can pour the soda ash solution down the drain.",
        "It won't harm the pipes.",
        "In fact, it may even clear out any clogs!",
        "Use the squeeze bottles to apply the dye to the front of the disk.",
        "Use whatever pattern you like.",
        "Most people prefer to use 1 color per section.",
        "Some people like to apply the colors randomly with multiple colors per section.",
        "Make sure that you stick the nozzle into the creases and folds, however; otherwise, the dye won't penetrate.",
        "Each space between 2 rubber bands counts as 1 section.",
        "Work on top of a surface that can get dirty or stained.",
        "An old baking sheet covered with plastic wrap would work great.",
        "Flip the disk over and apply the dye to the other side.",
        "Use the same colors and patterns as you did for the front, or change them up for a more unique design.",
        "Once you are done, pour the rest of the dye down the drain.",
        "You may be able to save the dye for later.",
        "Each brand is different, however, so read the label to find out whether or not you can store it for later use.",
        "Setting and Rinsing the Dye Place the shirt into a plastic bag for 24 hours.",
        "Use a resealable bag, such as a Ziploc bag.",
        "If you can only get a plain plastic bag, tie it shut instead.",
        "Leave the shirt in the bag for 24 hours so that the dye can set.",
        "Don't untie the shirt before you put it into the bag.",
        "Place the bag on top of a tray or a larger plastic bag in case the dye leaks.",
        "This will protect your work surface against stains.",
        "Remove the shirt from the bag with gloved hands.",
        "Put the plastic gloves back on your hands, then take the shirt out of the bag.",
        "Do not take the rubber bands off; leave them on.",
        "If you take the rubber bands off now, you risk getting dye onto the white areas of the shirt and ruining the tie dye effect.",
        "Rinse the shirt with cool water until the water runs clear.",
        "How long you rinse the shirt for depends on the brand and colors of dye that you used.",
        "Some will take a lot longer to rinse than others.",
        "Keep your gloves on for this step as the dye may still stain your hands.",
        "Remove the rubber bands, then rinse the shirt again.",
        "If you can't pull the rubber bands, cut them off instead.",
        "Shake the shirt out so that it's smooth, then rinse it again to get the rest of the dye out.",
        "Be sure to use cool water, not warm.",
        "Remember to wear your plastic gloves so that you don't get dye on your hands!",
        "You need to rinse the shirt twice because some of the dye was trapped inside the spiral.",
        "Wash the shirt in the washing machine.",
        "There will still be some dye left in the shirt, so it would be best to wash it separate from the rest of your laundry.",
        "If that's not possible, add a dye-setting solution (e.g.",
        ": Synthrapol) into your laundry.",
        "This will prevent the dye from staining the rest of your laundry.",
        "Alternatively, wash the shirt with similar colors.",
        "You can also wash it with black clothing; the dye won't show up on that.",
        "Stick with a \"cool\" or \"cold\" water setting.",
        "It is safe for all fabrics and won't fade the dye.",
        "Allow the shirt to dry.",
        "Hang the shirt up in the sun or use a clothes dryer.",
        "The heat from the dryer would actually help set the dye into the fabric better, but be aware that it may also cause the shirt to shrink a little!",
        "Once the shirt is dry, it's ready to wear!",
        "If you are using a clothes dryer, you can dry the shirt with other items.",
        "The color should not transfer to other garments."
