Get low and walk or crawl away from hazards such as windows, cabinets, televisions, and bookcases. If you're in a crowded public place, such as a store, do not rush toward the exits, even if you see lots of people doing so. Get away from display racks, glass, and exterior walls, and find a covered spot to take shelter.

Get down on your hands and knees, and crouch under the desk or table until the shaking stops. If you're in bed during an earthquake, stay there. Brace yourself, and protect your head and neck with a pillow. If you can't get under a sturdy table or desk, take cover in an interior corner of the building. Don't stand in a doorway. This is was recommended in the past, but you're safer under a sturdy table or crouched in a corner.
