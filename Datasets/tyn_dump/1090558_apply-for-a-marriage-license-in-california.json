Minors applying for a public marriage license must have the written consent of a parent or legal guardian (emancipated minors included), as well as permission from a California Superior Court Judge. You must marry in California. You can marry in a county other than where you receive the license, but it must still be in California. You must have at least one witness at your ceremony for public marriage licenses. Though the certificate has spaces for two witnesses to sign if you prefer. Couples applying for a confidential marriage license must sign an affidavit attesting to the fact that they live together as spouses at the time of the application. A confidential marriage is one that does not get entered into public record. Any persons other than the married couple requesting a copy of the marriage license must present a court order to receive one.
