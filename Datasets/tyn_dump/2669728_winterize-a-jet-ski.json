    "text": " Draining Your Jet Ski Remove your jet ski from the water. When you're done with the last ride of the season, get your jet ski out of the water as soon as possible. With your trailer securely attached to the back of your vehicle, slowly back your vehicle down the ramp until most of the trailer is underwater. Then get onto your jet ski, drive it up onto the trailer, and hook it to the trailer. Get back into your vehicle and slowly drive forward to safely remove the jet ski from the water. If possible, have a friend assist you with this so that one of you can drive the vehicle and the other can drive the jet ski. Reposition the jet ski for draining. The bow (front) needs to be higher than the stern (rear) of your jet ski so it can be drained properly. Secure your jet ski on the trailer so that the back of it is lower than the front. Turn the throttle back and forth to drain the water. Turn the jet ski on and alternate between moving the throttle back and forth in short bursts. Do this in 30 second intervals to prevent overheating. Continue this until water is no longer being expelled from the jet ski. Mix water and antifreeze in a bucket. Use RV antifreeze only! It is much less harmful to the environment. Do not use regular automotive antifreeze. The antifreeze will prevent any fluids from freezing in the exhaust system while the jet ski is stored. Mix one gallon (3.8 L) of RV antifreeze and one gallon (3.8 L) of water in a five gallon (18.9 L) bucket. Flush the mixture through the exhaust system. Hook a hose or water pump up to the flush outlet while keeping the other end submerged in the antifreeze mixture. Turn the engine on and off once the entire mixture has gone through the exhaust system. Cleaning, Gassing Up, and Lubricating Your Jet Ski Wash the exterior with car safe soap. Fill a bucket with warm water and add in a few squirts of car safe soap. Soak a scratch-free cloth in the soapy water and wipe down the exterior of your jet ski with it.

Batteries lose their charge over time, so it's necessary to remove the battery from your jet ski and charge it while your jet ski is stored. First disconnect the negative terminal and then disconnect the positive terminal. Charge the battery. Attach the battery to an automatic battery charger. Make sure to do this on a secure surface that's away from anything flammable. Also be sure to charge the battery in a location where the temperature won't drop below freezing.
