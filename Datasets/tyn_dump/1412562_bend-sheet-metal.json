To calculate the expansion that will take place on the outside of your bend angle, you will need to know your bend allowance. You can find your bend allowance with the following formula: (\u03c0/180) x B x (IR + K x MT) =  bend allowance (BA), where B is the angle complementary to your desired bend angle (1 to 180 degrees), MT is the thickness of the material, IR is the inside radius, and K is the K-factor. To ascertain your K-Factor, inside radius, and material thickness (expressed as a decimal), you should use an Bend Allowance Chart. As an example, if you want to bend 24 gauge sheet metal at a 90\u00b0 angle, the calculation would be: 0.017453 x 90 x (0.020 + 0.33 x 0.024) = 0.0438558984 inch bend allowance\nKeep in mind that some metals are more brittle than others. Bending a brittle metal beyond its limits could cause the metal to snap and break."

Your forms will have an edge that should match the angle of your desired bend. Situate your forms in the vise with the form block guide angle facing upwards out of your vise. One edge of your form will typically be rounded to the degree of your bend radius, thus helping you achieve your desired bend. Clamp your sheet metal in your vise. Now that your forms are placed, you should clamp your sheet between your form blocks very firmly. Take care to keep your bend line even with the guide angle of your forms.
