In addition, you can easily extend the shapes in the back to make the hair bigger or smaller. You\u2019re going to draw over the top of the head, so don\u2019t worry if it isn\u2019t perfect.

You can make them extend past the center of the head to make the hair hang over the character\u2019s eyes, or you can keep them kind of smaller for a simpler hairstyle. Leave each spike open at the top to finish placing your bangs. This should look like 2 connecting triangles that are missing the lines at the top. They can hang over the eyes or hang over the forehead. How sharp you make these lines will determine how spikey your hair looks. The straighter the lines, the sharper the hair."

The curlier you make the spikes, the more natural the hair will look. This is mostly a matter of personal preference though, since manga hair is often pretty geometric and pointy.

Most manga comics are in black and white. There\u2019s nothing wrong with leaving your hair white. Finished.  Illustrating Longer Hair Create an oval with sharper cheeks to make the outline of the head. In pencil, draw an outline for your character\u2019s head by sketching a simple oval. Give your head a jaw by using sharper lines for the bottom left and right of the oval. If you\u2019re drawing a female character, make the chin slightly pointer than you normally would, since female characters in manga typically have a thinner jaw.Tip: You don\u2019t have to make your character female just because you\u2019re drawing long hair. From Vegeta to Inyuasha, there are plenty of manga characters with long hair that are men. If you\u2019re drawing the entire body, add a rough outline for the neck and shoulders as well, since the hair in the back will flow behind the body. Draw a larger arc over the top of the head, running straight down at the sides. Right above the oval, draw an arced line running around the top of the head to start the outline for the hair. When the arc meets the temple on both sides, extend the oval into a straight line running slightly away from the head to finish the larger outline for the hair. If you want a thinner, wispier look, draw the lines on the side running straight down instead of slightly away from the head. This will make the back of the hair seem smaller. This will also make your character appear thinner. If you added shoulders and a neck, lead the hair behind the head by stopping the straight lines on either side when they meet the shoulders. Otherwise, make the hair as long as you\u2019d like and connect the 2 lines at the bottom with a single line. Add 2 thin, symmetrical rectangles over the cheeks and temples. To give the sides of the head some hair, draw 2 rectangles on either side of the face. Start each rectangle near the temple above the center of the head and extend it down past the cheek, stopping at the same horizontal line where your chin ends. Angle the sides of the rectangle slightly away from the center of the face to make the sides of the head seem round. Erase the top line of the rectangle to lead the hair into the top of the head. You can make theses rectangles longer if you want to give the character some longer hair. Draw an arc line connecting the sides of the rectangles to make bangs. Now that you\u2019ve got the sides and back of the hair, it\u2019s time to create the front. Draw a soft arc running from the middle of the rectangle on the left to the middle of the rectangle on the right. Lift the center of this line upwards in the middle towards the top of the head. This line should rest right above the eyes for a standard haircut. Give this line less arc than a banana. If you make the line too round, the character won\u2019t look natural. If the line is too straight, the hair will look flat. It should be a moderate arc that doesn\u2019t stand out too much. Erase tiny sections at the bottom of the bangs and sides to add breaks in the hair. To give the hair some texture, erase 3-4 small lengths at the base of the bangs and sides. For each section you erase, draw 2 lines that meet one another in a point higher in the hair, like a tent or \u201cA\u201d with no middle bar. This will give the hair some texture and make the hair seem like it\u2019s falling in separate sections. Lean towards smaller details instead of bigger sections to avoid making the hair look like it\u2019s missing giant clumps. Erase the guidelines and create texture by adding vertical lines to the hair. Use your eraser to remove the original outline for the top of the head. Erase anything in the middle of the rectangles on the sides that you\u2019ve drawn. If you want to add some texture to the hair, add a tuft at the top of the crown by drawing 3 small lines running away from a point at the top of the head. Add individual lines in the back of the hair to give the hair more direction. You can color the hair if you\u2019d like, but it\u2019s not mandatory for drawing manga. Finished.  Creating Spikey Hair Draw a perfect circle for the top of the head. To emphasize this radical hair style, draw the head tilting down a little bit and start by creating an outline for the top of the head. Draw a perfect circle in pencil wherever you want to place the top of the head. This hairstyle is perfect for a villain or main character since it\u2019s a little more distinct and involves some sharper shapes. It works for male or female characters. Add a chin and include an ear if you want the character looking away. Draw a light guideline running horizontally through the center of the circle. Just below the guideline on either side, draw 2 lines rounding down towards a chin.

Start on the left where the jaw line meets the circle. Draw large arc running upwards and dipping to a small point once it reaches the last third of the circle. Add a second, sharper arc by dipping back up before arching back down to the opposite side.

The point where the arcs dip and meet in the top of the head is the part. Erase your guide lines and add a sharper M-shaped form on top of the part. Erase the bottom of the circle to remove anything inside of the jaw lines and under the part. On top of the part, draw a smaller, spikey M-shape with the middle point layered on top of the point you made for the part. Draw it slightly askew, leaning to the right, and make the bar on the left thicker and sharper than the middle and the bar on the right.Tip: If you struggling to picture this shape, look at the part in Goku\u2019s hair when he turns super saiyan in Dragon Ball Z. Yugi\u2019s hair in Yu-Gi-Oh! has a similar aesthetic, but your drawing shouldn\u2019t be as symmetrical as his hair. This second \u201cM\u201d should cover a good portion of the hair line, but leave space on either side of the shape to make this form seem like it\u2019s floating in the front of the hair. Outline the top of the hair using a sequence of jagged points. Start right above the part at the top of the circle. Draw a sequence of spikes on the right side pointing away from the center of the head. On the opposite side, draw a larger sequence of spikes pointing to the left. You can point these spikes away from the head to make sharper, wilder hair, or bend the spikes slightly downward to make the hair seem more relaxed. Stop when you\u2019ve gotten to the point where the hairline meets the base of the circle. The spikes on the left should be slightly bigger than the spikes on the right. If you drew an ear, the spikes on the side where the ear is should flow behind the top of the ear. Erase the guide line on the longer side of the jagged M-shape. On the left of the big \u201cM\u201d you drew, erase the guide line representing the hairline. Leave the guide line on the right side though. Fill in the hairline on the left with a few longer tufts of hair. To finish your hair\u2019s outline, draw 2-3 larger, sharper points leading out of the \u201cM\u201d you drew. Point them in the same direction as the leftmost edge of the \u201cM.\u201d Connect the spike at the end of the left with the bottom of your hair outside the jaw. Leave the rightmost spike leading behind the \u201cM\u201d to keep it in front. This will round your hair out and give it some attitude. If you drew an ear, leave the guide line to make it seem like your character has a clean sideburn on the side they\u2019re facing. Add a few more spikes in the middle of the hair and color if you\u2019d like. To give the hair some texture, add some smaller sets of spikes on the left or right side of the head. Leave the top of the part empty to make the hair there seem thicker. Lead each spike you draw away from the center of the part. You can color hair if you\u2019d like but it\u2019s perfectly fine to leave the hair black and white. You can also outline your drawing in black marker to give it some definition. Finished. ",
