If you\u2019re taking gas (like helium) from a tank, place the lip of the balloon tightly over the nozzle and fill it up. Or, if you want to measure air, just blow up the balloon using your mouth. Tie the end of the balloon in a tight knot when you\u2019re done. Measure the balloon's circumference and radius. Wrap a cloth tape measure around the center of the balloon to check its circumference. To get the radius of your inflated balloon, place a ruler on each side of the center of the balloon, measure the distance between them, and divide it in half. For instance, you place your balloon between two rulers and find that the distance is 10 centimetres (3.9 in). Divide this in half to get the radius, 5 centimetres (2.0 in). Use the volume of a sphere formula. Plug in your measurements into the basic formula for the volume (V) of a sphere, V = 43\u03c0r3{\\displaystyle {\\frac {4}{3}}\\pi r^{3}}. Plug the radius into the formula to get your sum. For instance,: V = 43\u03c053{\\displaystyle {\\frac {4}{3}}\\pi 5^{3}}, or about 523.33 cm3{\\displaystyle ^{3}} or 206.04 in3{\\displaystyle ^{3}}. Fill up another balloon with water to compare your results. Place the lip of a balloon over a faucet and carefully run water into it.

Use a scale to find the mass instead. Put just a small piece of double-sided tape at the center of the scale and zero it. The tape will hold a balloon or other container in place.
