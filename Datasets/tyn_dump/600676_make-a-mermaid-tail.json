Read the label on the glue to for specific drying and curing times. It would be a good idea to weigh the shoes down with something heavy as well. Creating the Tail Body Take your measurements. Measure from your waist down to your ankles. Next, measure around your waist and both of your ankles. Record each of your measurements. If this is for an adult woman, measure the hips too. Note the distance between the belly button and the hips as well. Buy some stretchy, mermaid-like fabric. You can find this type of fabric in the dance-wear section of a fabric store. Make sure that it is smooth, shiny, and preferably with a scale pattern. You can also buy \"super hero\" spandex from the cosplay section of a fabric store. Fold the fabric in half lengthwise, then transfer your measurements. Divide your waist measurement by 4, then make the a mark that distance from the fold. Measure down along the fold based on your waist-to-ankle measurement. Divide your ankle measurement by 4, then make another mark that distance from the fold. Leave enough space below the ankles for the fins. Make sure that you are folding the fabric with the right sides facing in. If your fabric has scales on it, make sure that the scales are all pointing downwards. If this is for an adult woman, include the hip measurement as well. Remember to divide it by 4! Connect the marks with a straight line. If you included the hip measurement, you'll need to connect the waist mark to the hip mark, then the hip mark to the ankle mark. This completes your tail body. Add the fin template and trace around it. Fold the fin template in half, then place it onto the fabric. Make sure that the folded edges match up, and that the top edge of the template touches the bottom edge of the tail. Trace around the template, then pull it away. For a fancier tail, add a ragged, fringy edge to the bottom of the fin. Cut your fabric, including seam allowances. You will need to add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) to all edges, including the top. When you are done, cut a second piece of fabric just like the first one. Use the already-cut piece as a guide. If you added a ragged fringe to the bottom edge of your tail, you only need to add seam allowances to the outer edges of the fringe. Assembling the Tail Pin the fabric together, right sides facing in. Make sure that all of the edges match up. You only need to pin the sides and bottom of the tail, not the top edge. Sew the tail using a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) seam allowance. Use a ballpoint needle, a matching thread color, and a stretch stitch. Start sewing at one top edge, sew around the tail body and fin, then finish sewing at the other top side. Backstitch at the start and end of your sewing, and remove the pins as you sew. For extra security, sew around the tail three times. If you made a fancy tail, don't sew the fringe. Turn the tail right-side-out. Make sure that you push the corner of the tail fin out as well. At this point, you can try the tail on, and make any necessary adjustments. If you made a fancy tail, top stitch along the top edge of the fringe. Make sure that the top stitching follows the design of your mini fin. Tuck the mono fin into the tail. You ill need to bend the mono fin in order to fit it past the ankles and into the fin. Nestle the corners of the mono fin into the corners of the fin itself. Hem the top edge of the tail. Fold the top edge inward twice by \u00bd to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters). Sew along the bottom, folded edge using a stretch stitch.",
