Credit cards are accepted. There are discounted fares for those 65 and over, people with disabilities and for children. Kids under 6 ride for free. If you have a trailer or an extra long (over 22 feet or 6.7 meters) or tall vehicle (over 7 1/2 feet or 2.3 meters), such as an RV, there will be additional surcharges. There is a discounted fare for small cars and for motorcycles. Different fares also apply for all vehicles during \"peak season\", which is May 1 to September 30, adding another 25 percent. Most fare are \"one-way\", except those to \"the islands\" having no bridges to the mainland. Nearly all passenger tickets are \"round-trip\", except Sydney and Port Townsend/Coupeville. There are waiting areas for vehicles and you may be assigned a specific lane by the ticket seller or pay attention to flaggers who will direct you. At some terminals, such as Bainbridge, there is \"overflow waiting\" that backs up along the edge of local highways."
