The ideal twig is straight, smooth, and round so it makes a perfectly shaped whistle. If you can't find a willow twig that is 8 inches (20.3 cm) long, you can try to find a longer one and cut off 8 inches (20.3 cm) of it to make a whistle from. You can also cut off side branches if needed, although you may need a bigger knife."
