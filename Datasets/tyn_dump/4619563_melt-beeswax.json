                    "description": "If you already have a double boiler, you\u2019ll use the 2 pots it comes with. If not, pick out a large stock pot for the base. Then, find a metal saucepan or bowl that fits comfortably inside your stock pot. Find one that can rest on the lip of the stock pot so that it doesn\u2019t touch the bottom. Try a wide metal bowl or a smaller saucepan with a long handle. If you use a saucepan, rest the handle on the lip of the stock pot while the pan portion floats in the water. Only use a metal bowl for the smaller piece; don\u2019t use plastic or glass, which might melt or shatter. You won\u2019t be putting any wax inside the stock pot, so it\u2019s okay to use a pot you prepare food in. However, you will be placing the beeswax directly into the smaller saucepan or bowl, so choose an old one that you won\u2019t be using for food preparation. If you\u2019re using a tall metal pitcher or another bowl that does touch the bottom of the stock pot, place a metal cookie cutter at the bottom and set the smaller bowl on top of this. The cookie cutter will elevate the bowl off of the heat source."

        "You won\u2019t be putting any wax inside the stock pot, so it\u2019s okay to use a pot you prepare food in.",
        "However, you will be placing the beeswax directly into the smaller saucepan or bowl, so choose an old one that you won\u2019t be using for food preparation.",
        "If you\u2019re using a tall metal pitcher or another bowl that does touch the bottom of the stock pot, place a metal cookie cutter at the bottom and set the smaller bowl on top of this.",
        "The cookie cutter will elevate the bowl off of the heat source.",
        "Line the bottom of the large stock pot with water.",
        "Depending on which type of bowl you\u2019re nesting inside the larger pot, you may need more or less water.",
        "Fill the bottom of your stock pot with enough tap water so that it\u2019s at least 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) deep.",

        "Make sure your stock pot sits sturdily on the burner.",
        "Hot wax is dangerous, so you\u2019ll want to prevent it from accidentally getting knocked over.",
        "Since water boils at 212 \u00b0F (100 \u00b0C), using a double boiler will make it difficult for the wax to exceed this temperature and reach its flash point.",
        "Place solid pieces of beeswax into the smaller bowl.",
        "To speed up the melting process, cut or break the wax into smaller chunks.",
        "Aim for cubes or slivers around 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) wide.",

        "Reduce the burner\u2019s heat to \u201cmedium\u201d or \u201cmedium-high\u201d to keep the water going at a steady simmer.",
        "Then, place the top half of your double-boiler into the bottom half.",
        "If you\u2019re using a smaller bowl or saucepan, make sure its bottom touches the water but not the bottom of the stock pot; you don\u2019t want to expose the beeswax to the heat source.",
        "Never expose beeswax directly to the heat source.",
        "Doing so can cause the wax to melt unevenly and may scorch the wax or cause a fire.",
        "Allow the solid beeswax to melt slowly over the simmering water.",
        "Constantly monitor the beeswax as it melts.",
        "After about 2 to 3 minutes, you\u2019ll start to notice the wax beginning to melt.",
        "You may have to wait anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour for the wax to completely melt.",
        "Keep an eye on the water level, too.",
        "If it begins to evaporate away, pour more water into the stockpot periodically.",
        "Don\u2019t let the double boiler to become completely dry at any point during the process.",
        "You don\u2019t need to stir the pieces of wax; the melted liquid will quickly solidify upon contact with a colder utensil.",
        "Feel free to use a thermometer to monitor the temperature of your beeswax as it melts.",
        "It should melt around 144 to 150 \u00b0F (62 to 66 \u00b0C).",
        "Don\u2019t allow it to exceed 170 \u00b0F (77 \u00b0C) as it will get discolored and lose its aroma past this point.",

        "Wear oven gloves to protect your hands from the hot steam and any splashes of wax.",
        "If you\u2019re pouring the hot wax into glass, make sure it is heat resistant so it doesn\u2019t crack.",
        "Using a Crock Pot Water Bath Pour 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) of water into the basin of your crock pot.",
        "If you have a wide, shallow crock pot, try about 2 in (5.1 cm) of water, or add 3 in (7.6 cm) or more for a narrow, tall crock pot.",
        "Start with enough water so that it won\u2019t all evaporate while you\u2019re melting the beeswax.",
        "You can use tap water, or, to speed up the process, heat the water in a kettle first.",
        "It\u2019s also possible to melt the beeswax directly in the basin of the crock pot without creating a water bath, since the temperature can remain low.",
        "If you choose to do this, make sure that the crock pot basin is made from a nonstick material or line it with aluminum foil.",
        "Using the water bath is generally preferred, since it protects the wax from direct heat and makes pouring the liquid wax much easier.",
        "Place a small metal bowl inside the crock pot.",
        "Choose an old metal bowl that you won\u2019t be using for food preparation.",
        "Select a bowl that\u2019s tall enough so that water won\u2019t seep in, but not so tall that you can\u2019t close the lid of the crock pot.",
        "Make sure the bowl sits directly on the bottom of the crock pot\u2019s basin; it doesn\u2019t need to be elevated.",
        "If you\u2019re making candles, you may be able to use your candle containers for this.",
        "Just make sure you\u2019re using metal or heat-resistant glass.",
        "Set pieces of the solid beeswax into the small bowl.",
        "Since beeswax melts slowly in a crock pot water bath, use smaller pieces to help speed up the melting process.",
        "Break larger pieces of wax into small chunks of about 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) wide, then set these into the small bowl.",

        "Set the solar oven in the sun and allow the beeswax to melt.",
        "Make sure it\u2019s a warm, sunny day; cloud cover and cooler temperatures won\u2019t work very well.",
        "While high-tech solar ovens can heat up in sunny but cold climates, plan to use your homemade solar oven on a cloudless day when it\u2019s at least 55 \u00b0F (13 \u00b0C) outside.",
        "Find a spot outside that will receive direct sunlight for most of the day, and place your covered solar oven there.",
