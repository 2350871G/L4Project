Wipe down the kettle with one of these substances, using steel wool, to remove any type of stain, including a grease stain. You can scrub your kettle with a steel wool pad with a few drops of either oven cleaner or ammonia. Scrub it the same way you would scrub metal cookware and keep scrubbing until the stains come off. Then, rinse your kettle completely to remove the cleaner. However, never use ammonia or oven cleaner together. Some oven cleaners contain bleach, which makes a deadly gas when mixed with ammonia. Do not use ammonia if you used bleach to clean any part of the kettle, including the inside."
