        "You will only need about 1 tablespoon (15 grams) for each leg.",
        "Take care not to scrub too harshly, however, or you will irritate your skin instead.",
        "Rinse the scrub off.",

        "Many people find that exfoliating their legs just before shaving helps them get a smoother, closer shave.",
        "Pat your skin dry, and apply a moisturizer, if desired.",
        "Sugar scrubs already contain plenty of oil, so you will likely not need to apply a moisturizer afterwards.",
        "If your skin still feels dry, however, you can apply some moisturizer.",
        "Making and Using Sugar Scrub Bars Assemble a soap-making double-boiler and bring the water to a boil over medium heat.",
        "Fill a pot with 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of water.",
        "Place a large glass measuring cup or jar in the center.",
        "Cut the glycerin soap base into 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) cubes and add them to the cup.",
        "This recipe is enough for 8 cubes.",
        "Stir in \u00bc cup (55 grams) of coconut oil.",
        "Keep stirring until the oil has melted.",
        "Make sure that you are using solid coconut oil and not liquid.",
        "Carefully remove the cup from the pot and set it aside for 5 minutes.",
        "Let the mixture cool down a little.",
        "Be careful when handling the cup; use an oven mitt or potholder to handle it.",
        "Stir in 10 drops of your favorite essential oil to give your scrub bar a nice scent.",
        "Once the mixture has cooled a little, start adding the essential oil.",
        "You don't want to add the oil too soon, or the heat will cause the fragrance to burn off.",
        "You can use a single scent, or a combination of two or more scents.",
        "Here are some suggestions to get you started:\nBasil and lemon\nCinnamon and clove\nLavender and lemon\nOrange and vanilla\nVanilla and lavender Stir in 1 cup (225 grams) of sugar.",
        "Make sure that the mixture is cool before you add the sugar, or the sugar will melt.",
        "Keep stirring until everything is evenly combined.",
        "There should be no streaks, swirls, lumps, or clumps.",
        "Carefully pour the mixture into a silicon ice cube tray.",
        "You can also use a soap-making mold, if you'd like a larger bar.",
        "Wait until the mixture hardens, then carefully pop the cubes out.",
        "This will take 1 to 2 hours.",
        "Once it hardens, it will become opaque and solid, sort of like a sugar cube or textured soap bar.",
        "If you notice that the bar is still damp, wait until it dries completely before you use it.",
        "If you are in a hurry, you can also stick the molds in the freezer.",
        "The scrub bar will set even faster there.",
        "Get into a bathtub or shower, and soak your legs for 5 minutes.",
        "During this time, you can start your usual bathing or showering routine.",
        "Soaking your legs first will help soften the skin and make the scrub more effective.",
        "Take a sugar scrub bar, and massage your legs with it using small, circular motions.",
        "Take care not to scrub too harshly, however, or you may irritate your skin.",
        "As you use the bar, it may crumble in your hands.",
        "Don't worry, this is normal.",
        "Simply keep massaging the scrub over your legs.",
        "You can also dampen the scrub bar first, crumble it, and then use it as a normal sugar scrub.",
        "Rinse the scrub off.",
        "Because this scrub already contains soap, you likely won't have much or any residue left on your legs when you are done.",
        "If you do have an oily residue, you can simply wash it off using soap, or leave it on for extra moisture.",
        "Consider shaving your legs when you are done.",
        "Many people find that exfoliating just before shaving leaves their skin extra smooth.",
        "Pat your skin dry, and apply moisturizer, if needed.",
        "The sugar scrub bar already contains some oil, so you may not need to apply moisturizer.",
        "If your skin still feels dry after using the scrub, however, you may apply some moisturizer.",

        "Don't let them get wet until you are ready to use them."
