Fondant and buttercream provide the best surfaces to paint on, and you can select one or the other based on your personal tastes and available budget. Fondant is fairly expensive and can be hard to work with, but it offers a nice, smooth slate to paint on. You can start with a fondant-covered cake, or buy sheets of fondant and paint them before putting them on the cake. Buttercream is a bit cheaper and most people think it tastes better than fondant. It\u2019s also softer than fondant, which makes harder to work with. This isn\u2019t a big deal as long as you stay vigilant about keeping the cake chilled during the painting process."

Be sure to set up your workspace on a flat surface in a cool area, since the cake will start to soften as soon as you take it out of the fridge.

High-proof grain alcohol is easy to work with and dries quickly, so you can layer color and add details easily without messing up previous coats. Water is a common choice, but it dries slowly and may not be a great option for beginners. Lemon extract contains alcohol, so it dries pretty quickly, but it\u2019s also expensive and harder to find. Alcohol is the best choice if you\u2019re planning to paint intricate details, or if you want the process to go quickly. Don\u2019t worry \u2013 the alcohol will evaporate completely and won\u2019t leave any trace of flavor behind. Keep in mind that lemon extract can leave traces of citrus flavor behind.

Continue reloading your brush with color, as needed, to maintain consistent saturation. It can help to paint a light sketch of your design onto the cake to block out your space before adding saturated colors and details on top.

        "Place a small jar of thinner near your workspace to clean your brushes.",
        "You will use this to clean your brushes in between applications so that you don't contaminate colors.",
        "Avoid drawing from this jar of thinner to dilute paint further, since it will be contaminated with other colors and create muddy colors on your palette.",
        "Applying the Color Use wide brushes to paint large spaces and small brushes to add details.",
        "Regular artist paint brushes work perfectly for this, and it helps to have an assortment of sizes on hand.",
        "It doesn't matter what the brushes are made out of as long as the bristles are high-quality, neat, and synthetic.",
        "Experiment with different brush sizes and shapes to create different effects.",
        "For example, you could try using a Japanese calligraphy brush to paint ultra-fine details onto your cake.",
        "Synthetic bristles are considered to be food-safe.",
        "Natural brushes are made from animal hair and aren't recommended.",
        "You can also work with sponges or foam applicators to get different looks.",
        "Paint the background colors in first.",
        "Dip a large, wide brush into the diluted color of your choice until the bristles are saturated.",
        "Lightly touch the brush to the cake's surface and paint on the color using even strokes.",
        "You can use any color you'd like for the background, but keep in mind that if you're painting details on top, they will need to be darker than the background to show up.",
        "Continue reloading your brush with color, as needed, to maintain consistent saturation.",
        "It can help to paint a light sketch of your design onto the cake to block out your space before adding saturated colors and details on top.",
        "Remember to touch the surface of the cake with the brush as lightly as you can.",
        "You don\u2019t want to disturb the smoothness of the surface at all.",
        "Let each coat dry before adding a new one to prevent smudging.",
        "Always let the first layer dry before adding details on top, especially if you\u2019re creating a detailed or intricate design.",
        "If you\u2019re diluting the paint with alcohol, it will be mostly dry within a few seconds.",
        "If you\u2019re using water or lemon extract, let coats dry for several minutes and double check before adding new colors on top.",
        "If you\u2019re going for a stylized watercolor design, you can experiment with adding new colors without letting the first layers dry to create cool, blurry effects.",
        "Paint details and outlines last.",
        "Start by painting in middle-ground details and save the finest details for last for the best results.",
        "When you\u2019re doing lettering or smaller elements, start with a tiny amount of color on the brush and work up from there.",
        "You can always reload your brush to darken a color, but once the paint is on the cake, it\u2019s really hard to correct mistakes or tone down the color.",
        "Check your cake periodically and pop it back in the fridge if it softens.",
        "If the surface no longer feels hard to the touch, or if you notice the paintbrush making an impression on the surface, you need to chill the cake for a few minutes before continuing.",
        "Chill it for 15 minutes to an hour until it firms back up.",
        "This is important, especially if you\u2019re working with buttercream, since it softens faster than fondant.",
        "If you\u2019re waiting for a color to dry before adding a new layer, consider chilling the cake during this time."
