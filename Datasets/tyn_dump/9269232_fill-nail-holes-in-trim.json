You don\u2019t want to cause damage to the trim around the nail holes. If the trim has ridges or raised edges, use a butter knife to remove the fragments so you don\u2019t damage the details. Smooth down the nail holes with fine-grit sandpaper. Any sandpaper with a grade between 120 and 220 will work. The sandpaper should be able to get off any raised fragments on the trim that the putty knife couldn\u2019t. Brush the sandpaper across the surface of the nail holes a few times until they feel smooth. Applying the Spackling Get shrink-free spackling. Shrink-free spackling won\u2019t shrink when it dries in the holes on the trim. Avoid spackling that shrinks or you could end up with dips in the holes you fill in. You can find shrink-free spackling online or at your local hardware store. You can use painter\u2019s caulk or water-based wood filler as alternatives. Scoop out some spackling from the container with a putty knife. You don\u2019t need a lot. You just want enough on the knife to fill in a nail hole. Scoop out the spackle with the end of the knife so it\u2019s easier to press into a hole. Press the spackling on the knife into one of the nail holes. Start with the edge of the knife on one side of the hole at a 45-degree angle. Scrape the knife across the surface of the hole to the other side. Press firmly down on the knife so the spackling completely fills in the nail hole. Scrape across the surface of the hole two or three times to make sure the spackling is flat. To smooth out the spackling and/or fill the holes, you can also use your finger. Use a damp cloth to wipe away any excess spackling around the hole. Do this immediately after you spackle all the holes in the trim so the spackling doesn\u2019t have time to dry. Let the spackling dry for 2-3 hours. Check back on the spackling after a few hours to see if it\u2019s dry. If it\u2019s not, let it continue drying. If you notice a dip in the spackling inside the nail hole, apply another coat and wait 2-3 more hours for the new coat of spackling to dry. Sand off excess spackling with a fine-grit sandpaper. Lightly brush the sandpaper across the surface of the trim where the hole is until the spackling is flush with the trim. Painting Over the Holes Wipe down and vacuum the trim so there\u2019s no leftover dust. Any dust particles left on the trim may be visible after you finish painting. Use a paintbrush or cloth to wipe down the surface of the trim, and attach a brush head to the vacuum for the best results. Apply a spot primer over the spackled nail holes. Spot primer will prevent the spackling spots on the trim from looking different from the rest of the trim when they get painted over. Use a paintbrush to apply a thin coat of spot primer over each filled-in nail hole. You can find spot primer at your local hardware store. Put painter\u2019s tape on any surfaces you don\u2019t want paint to get on. Cover the parts of the walls directly around the trim. Apply a strip of painter\u2019s tape to the floor if you\u2019re painting a baseboard. Paint the trim using a paintbrush. Use the same paint that was used on the rest of the trim. You may need to do multiple coats before the paint looks even on the trim. If you sanded down the filled nail holes and primed them with a spot primer, they should be completely hidden behind the fresh paint.",
