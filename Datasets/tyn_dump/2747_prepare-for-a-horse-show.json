Always clip your horse a nice, clean bridle path - for stock horses, the length of the ear but for light breeds about an ear and a half.

This will add great style to your overall presentation. For a local show, a button up western shirt, nice show pants, boots, and a belt may be very acceptable. But for more competitive shows, everyone will be wearing more elaborate garments such as form fitting silkies and vests, expensive chaps, etc. If your budget will not allow you to make these purchases, as long as your outfit compliments yourself as well as your horse, then you have nothing to worry about. Dark colors on light horses, and lighter colors on dark horses tend to draw more attention to them. It's not recommended to wear an all-black outfit in the show ring. Most of your competition will also be wearing it and you will want to stand out among everyone else. A deep purple or midnight blue is a great alternative. If you are confident in your skills and the skills of your horse, try drawing a bit of extra attention with a brightly colored shirt is a good option. You will stand out in the crowd and be more memorable in a sea of similar colors."

Do not wear boots that have a high heels. The glove should successfully keep any bare flesh from being seen between your hands and the sleeve of your jacket. For saddle seat you need a full suit: day coat and matching pants with shined jodhpur boots and either a derby hat for the female riders, or a fedora for the male riders, that accents your outfit.

Black hoof polish can be applied on naturally black hooves, while clear polish should be applied to hooves any color other than black. This should all be done on a clean hard surface. Put down rubber or heavy foam mats on the ground in your grooming area, to allow the hoof black to dry. Once the hoof black is completely dry, dirt may be wiped off with a dry towel. If you don\u2019t want to polish your horses hooves, rub in some lanolin oil to add extra shine.

Make sure you've gotten enough sleep the night before, and enough to eat and drink before the competition. Do some deep breathing exercises and visualization to relax; listen to music or repeat a mantra if that helps you. Be sure to help your horse relax as well, going for a walk or lunge with them if necessary. Don't worry about the other competitors. Act as if you were riding alone in your home arena. It will calm your nerves, and encourage you to pay attention to your own riding. Of course, be alert, and avoid running into the other riders in the ring."

Additionally, you could choose to pack a pair of more comfortable clothes/shoes for the ride to and from the venue. Getting Yourself Ready Dress for Western classes. For western competitions such as Western pleasure or Western horsemanship, always wear an outfit that makes your horse stand out and color coordinates with your saddle pad. This will add great style to your overall presentation. For a local show, a button up western shirt, nice show pants, boots, and a belt may be very acceptable. But for more competitive shows, everyone will be wearing more elaborate garments such as form fitting silkies and vests, expensive chaps, etc. If your budget will not allow you to make these purchases, as long as your outfit compliments yourself as well as your horse, then you have nothing to worry about. Dark colors on light horses, and lighter colors on dark horses tend to draw more attention to them. It's not recommended to wear an all-black outfit in the show ring. Most of your competition will also be wearing it and you will want to stand out among everyone else. A deep purple or midnight blue is a great alternative. If you are confident in your skills and the skills of your horse, try drawing a bit of extra attention with a brightly colored shirt is a good option. You will stand out in the crowd and be more memorable in a sea of similar colors. Dress for English classes. You should wear a dark and/or traditional coat (navy, black, hunter green, tan, gray, brown, or copper) and breeches that complement, generally a light neutral or white color. Your shirt should have a stock collar and pin or a ratcatcher collar. Your boots should be highly shined and your gloves should match your boots; black is the recommended color. Do not wear boots that have a high heels. The glove should successfully keep any bare flesh from being seen between your hands and the sleeve of your jacket. For saddle seat you need a full suit: day coat and matching pants with shined jodhpur boots and either a derby hat for the female riders, or a fedora for the male riders, that accents your outfit. Helmets for English classes should be a dark color (i.e. black, navy). Check the guidelines for your event to see what the specifics are. Do your hair properly. Always have your hair up, make sure to get all fly-aways before showing, unless you are showing hunter/jumper or dressage. For more competitive shows, all hair should absolutely be under your helmet, or tightly fastened into a neat bun in a hairnet at the back of your head, just barely below your hat or helmet. Often for younger children or for riders on ponies, braids with bows is considered to be more appropriate. Preparing Day-of Feed your horse. Overfeeding or underfeeding at an event is a surefire way to make your horse uncomfortable, and therefore less show-ready. Follow their regular diet plan, adjusting feeding around events if  necessary. Your horse will be happier and easier to work with after having eaten. Do a final grooming. Don\u2019t bathe your horse, but brush them down really well to make their coat gleam. Spend the most time using the curry comb, and make sure to address all parts of their body. Spend extra time on white areas and apply more baby powder, corn starch, or French chalk if necessary. Polish your horse\u2019s hooves. English and western riders often sand the horses hooves to make them smooth, then apply hoof polish. Black hoof polish can be applied on naturally black hooves, while clear polish should be applied to hooves any color other than black. This should all be done on a clean hard surface. Put down rubber or heavy foam mats on the ground in your grooming area, to allow the hoof black to dry. Once the hoof black is completely dry, dirt may be wiped off with a dry towel. If you don\u2019t want to polish your horses hooves, rub in some lanolin oil to add extra shine. Appaloosas are not permitted to use hoof polish of ANY color, other than clear, and even that is frowned upon. Check with your breed registry for specifications and regulations. Take time to relax. Shows and events are intended to be enjoyable; if you\u2019re nervous you will not only enjoy the event less, but your horse will mirror your emotions and you likely won\u2019t show as well. Make sure you've gotten enough sleep the night before, and enough to eat and drink before the competition. Do some deep breathing exercises and visualization to relax; listen to music or repeat a mantra if that helps you. Be sure to help your horse relax as well, going for a walk or lunge with them if necessary. Don't worry about the other competitors. Act as if you were riding alone in your home arena. It will calm your nerves, and encourage you to pay attention to your own riding. Of course, be alert, and avoid running into the other riders in the ring.",
