Remember, there will always be other discos and parties so if you can't decide over what top or jeans to wear, then you can simply save one pair for another time. Consider what you want to look like on the night. A pretty girly girl? A rock princess? A relaxed chick? All are great looks! Here are some ideas:\nGirly girl\nA mini-dress and bright tights. A pretty skirt\nShorts with some black tights (or even brightly coloured ones!) Slogan or cool top\nDenim skirt or jeans with leggings\nConverse or flat trainers\nRelaxed chick\nWide legged denim jeans\nSweet top\nFlat trainers\nMini pencil skirt"

            "description": "There are loads of great looks and ideas to try. Hair that looks loose and carefree is best for a disco,and the trick is to not look like you spent hours trying to achieve one style. Some good ideas are:\nStraighten your hair and accessorize with a headband, clips or putting hair up into a natural bun, plaits or tie half of your hair up and leave half of it down. (Remember to use heat protection spray or cream, as not to burn or frazzle your style when using heated styling tools). Put your hair up and curling the ends to a cool, relaxed look that has a big impact. If you have short hair, a light curl is pretty with a bow or flower depending on your outfit\nLeave your hair down and curl the ends to create beautiful, heavenly curls. Remember that if you need anything like gel to keep a do in place that you do not use too much. Having over-slicked or greasy hair doesn't look nice at all."
