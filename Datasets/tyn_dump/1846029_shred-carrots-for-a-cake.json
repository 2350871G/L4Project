Place the carrot against the side of the grater that has the smallest holes. The length of the carrot should be against the side of the grater. Grate the carrot using a downward motion. Make sure to keep your fingers and hands away from the sharp edges of the grater. Discard the carrot piece when it becomes so small that you can no longer grasp it as you shred.  Repeat the process with additional carrot pieces until all of your carrots are shredded.  Add the carrots to your cake batter according to the recipe instructions.  Shredding Carrots with a Food Processor or Blender Use a food processor or blender to shred up your carrots. It takes less time than grating the carrots by hand. Place your peeled carrots on a cutting board. Cut each of them into three or four pieces. Smaller pieces will be easier for your food processor or blender to handle. Place the pieces into the food processor or blender. Attach the cover securely. Turn the machine on and shred the carrots until they reach the desired size and texture. Do not shred them for too long, or they will turn into a puree. You want your carrots to have the look of coarse sawdust or pencil shavings.
