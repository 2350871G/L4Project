Once you\u2019ve stretched 1 of your rotator cuffs, switch arms and repeat the stretch to warm up and stretch the other cuff. Place both of your hands behind you at the level of your waist. Rotate both of your elbows forward until you feel the rotator cuffs stretch. Then squat down (keeping your knees wide apart) and place your elbows between your knees. This will keep them in a position that stretches your rotator cuffs. This position allows you to stretch both cuffs simultaneously. If it helps you keep your hands behind your back, use 1 hand to grasp the wrist of the other hand. Crouch down with your elbows trapped for 20 seconds at a time. As you hold your body in this position, you\u2019ll feel your exterior rotator cuffs stretch. Continue to exert a gentle pressure inward with your knees. This will force your elbows closer together and stretch your rotator cuffs. Hold the position for about 20 seconds before releasing your arms and standing back up.

For example, either a bedpost or a doorknob would work well. Stand about 2 feet (0.61 m) away from the tied end of the band, with your affected rotator cuff closest to the band. Bend your elbow at a 90-degree angle and keep the elbow tucked close against your body. Your hand should extend straight out in front of you. Pull your arm in so that your wrist touches your stomach. As you pull against the resistance band, you\u2019ll feel your internal rotator cuffs start to stretch. Hold your wrist against your belly for 4-5 seconds and slowly release your arm. Repeat this exercise 10-12 times in a row. You\u2019ll feel your shoulder stretch as you pull against the resistance band. Stop immediately if you feel a sharp pain in your shoulder.",
