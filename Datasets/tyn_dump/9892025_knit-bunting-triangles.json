    "text": " Starting a Triangle Get out heavy worsted weight yarn and US size 8 (5mm) needles. Choose a yarn in any color or pick several colors if you want to alternate the bunting. You'll also need a pair of straight US size 8 (5mm) needles and a tapestry needle. To finish threading the bunting, you'll also need ribbon, cord, or a crocheted cord that's as long as you want the bunting to be. Cast on 30 stitches. Make a slip knot and slide it onto 1 of your needles. Tug on the yarn to tighten the slip knot. Then cast on 30 stitches. This will become the long base of 1 bunting triangle. Knit every stitch on the first row and decrease knit stitches for row 2. Knit each stitch across row 1 and then turn the work. For row 2, knit together (k2tog) the first 2 stitches so only 1 stitch is transferred to your right needle. Yarn over and k2tog across the rest of the second row. Turn the work. The second row should be slightly narrower than the first row you made. Knit row 3 and slip slip knit (ssk) to decrease row 4. Knit every stitch on the third row and turn the work. Knit the first stitch on row 4 and then slip 2 stitches onto the right needle. Insert the left needle into the front of the stitches you just slipped. Wrap the yarn over and knit the stitch to complete the ssk. Knit the rest of row 4 until you get to the last 3 stitches. Then k2tog and knit 1. Knit rows 5, 6, and 7. Turn your work once you've finished row 4 and knit every stitch of row 5. Turn the work and knit each stitch for row 6. Turn the row before you knit row 7. Turn the work. You should now have 13 stitches on your needle. Knitting the Rest of a Triangle Work a decreasing row and knit 3 rows. To decrease row 8, knit 1 and ssk the next 2 stitches. Knit each stitch until you reach the last 3 stitches. Then k2tog and knit the last stitch. Turn the work and knit every stitch for 3 more rows. Repeat this step 2 more times to reach row 20. Make a decreasing row for row 20. Knit the first stitch and ssk the following 2 stitches. Then knit every stitch until you're 3 stitches from the end. K2tog and knit the last stitch before you turn the work. You should now have 5 stitches on your needle. Knit row 21 and decrease row 22. Knit every stitch for the 21 row and turn the work. Knit the first stitch on row 22 and slip 2 stitches (sl2tog) onto the right needle. Knit the next stitch and pick up and pass both of the slipped stitches (psso) over the stitch you just knit. Knit the last stitch. Knit row 23 and decrease row 24. Turn the work and knit every stitch of row 23. Turn the work and immediately slip 2 stitches (sl2tog) onto the right needle. Knit 1 stitch and then pick up and pass both of the slipped stitches (psso) over the stitch you just knit. The triangle bunting should know have a definite point. Bind off the yarn and weave in the ends. Cut the working yarn to leave a 2 in (5 cm) tail and pull it through the last stitch. Pull the yarn tightly to knot the yarn. Thread the tail through your tapestry needle and weave in the end. Then thread the tail from the wide end of the bunting and weave in that end. Threading the Bunting Knit as many bunting triangles as you like. For a small strand of bunting, make just 3 triangles. You can make a long bunting with large gaps between the triangles or make lots of triangles so they hang close together. Remember that you can make the triangles in different colors. Cut a length of ribbon as long as you like. Choose any type of ribbon you want and use scissors to cut it. You can use a thick ribbon, thin thread, strand of yarn, or crocheted cord. Weave each triangle bunting through the ribbon. Take the end of the ribbon and feed it through the holes near the top of 1 knit triangle. You should have 6 or 7 holes that you created as you knit the triangle. Slide the triangle down the ribbon and thread another triangle on. Remember to alternate colors if you made different colored triangles. Hang the bunting. Secure 1 end of the bunting and pull it across the space where you're hanging it. Keep in mind that the bunting should drape down a little in the center, so don't pull it taut. Secure the other end and enjoy your bunting. Consider wrapping the bunting around a nail or tack. You can also tape the ends depending on where you're hanging the bunting.",
