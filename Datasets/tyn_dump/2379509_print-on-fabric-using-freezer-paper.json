Consider using fabric that is 100% cotton, like a 200 count muslin for the best transfer results (and more vibrant colors). If your design has colors, use white fabric (or as close to white as possible) to make sure the colors stay true to the design. For black and white designs, feel free to use whatever color fabric you like so long as it\u2019s not so dark that the ink won\u2019t show up (i.e., black or dark navy ink won\u2019t show up well on black or dark blue fabric).

        "Even if it feels dry to the touch, it\u2019s better to wait to peel it off just in case.",
        "It may be tempting to peel some of it back right away to get a peek, but doing so could cause the ink to run and, as a result, distort and smudge the image.",
        "Wedge your fingernail into a corner and peel the fabric and freezer paper apart.",
        "Once the ink is dry, wedge your fingernail into one of the corners between the two sheets and carefully peel them apart.",
        "Go slowly and be careful not to stretch or pull on the fabric.",
        "It may help to place the bonded sheets near the edge of a flat surface and bend one of the corners back.",
        "Setting and Caring for Your Printed Fabric Treat the printed fabric with a fabric-setting spray to keep it from fading.",
        "Purchase a fabric setting or finishing spray from any craft store.",
        "Hold the canister about 6 inches (15 cm) to 8 inches (20 cm) away from the fabric and coat the entire surface with an even layer.",
        "This will ensure the ink doesn\u2019t rub off or wash away.",
        "Some home-printing fabrics come pre-treated to help retain color better.",
        "These don\u2019t require any setting sprays or sealants.",
        "Some fabric-setting sprays should be used while the ink is still wet\u2014refer to the instructions on the bottle.",
        "Soak the printed fabric in hot water and fabric guard for 20 minutes.",
        "Fill a tray large enough to hold the printed fabric with about 32 fluid ounces (950 mL) of hot water and stir in the recommended amount of fabric guard.",
        "Stir it around until it\u2019s well incorporated and then place the printed fabric into the solution for 20 minutes.",
        "Rinse it with cold water and let it dry for 24 hours.",
        "Refer to the directions on the back of the bottle to determine how much you should use.",
        "Fabric guard acts as a protective shield on each fiber of the fabric.",
        "It will keep your graphic looking vibrant and protect the cloth from stains.",
        "This ink-setting method works best with pigment-based inks which are commonly used in printers geared toward high-quality photography prints.",
        "You can use it with dye-based inks as well, but note that a little of the dye may seek out of the fabric while it\u2019s soaking.",
        "Spray the printed fabric with an upholstery protector.",
        "Hold the upholstery protector 6 inches (15 cm) to 8 inches (20 cm) away from the dried fabric and spray a layer onto the entire surface.",
        "Use a steady stream and work in lines instead of spraying it in a random fashion.",
        "You may want to place the printed fabric onto a sheet of newspaper before spraying it to protect your floors or other surfaces.",
        "If you plan to regularly wash the fabric, it\u2019s best to avoid upholstery protector and use a setting spray or solution.",
        "Wash the printed fabric in cold water, if necessary.",
        "If you used the printed fabric on something that\u2019s going to require washing like clothing or a pillowcase, make sure to use cold water.",
        "You can use your regular detergent so long as it doesn\u2019t contain bleach.",
        "Avoid putting your printed fabric in the dryer because it might shrink the fabric and distort the image\u2014especially if it\u2019s mostly cotton.",
        "If you must use the dryer, choose a no-heat or low-heat setting."
