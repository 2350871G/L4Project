This will remove any dust from the package so it doesn't get onto your chocolate. If you'd like to clean the balloons more, wash them in a bowl of cold water.

To make large chocolate bowls, blow them up until they're about halfway inflated. Although you can use water balloons, these will be harder to pop, which will make it hard to pull away from the chocolate."

Heat the water over low heat until it simmers. Then place a heat-proof bowl on the pot and put 2 1/2 cups (437 g) of chopped chocolate into it. Stir the chocolate until it's melted and smooth. This should take about 10 minutes.Tip: If you prefer, put the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave it. Heat it in 15-second increments and stir in between intervals until the chocolate melts. The bowl with the chocolate shouldn't be touching the water in the pot below it."

Make 1 circle for each chocolate bowl and leave about 6 inches (15 cm) of space between the circles.
