If a band knows you are going to sit on an interview, without cleaning it up, editing it and posting it, they are not going to want spend time giving you an interview if they are not going to gain exposure or sales."

Either find an email address or get their digits. \u201cYou should be enthusiastic about it but not over the top,\u201d says Don Runk WFCF 88.5 host of Kaleidoscope and Underwriting Director. You can also contact the band through email addresses listed on their website, Facebook or Twitter. If they are a larger band, look on their website for their press contact. If they are a lesser known band, you can email them directly. As a last effort contact their record label. This is not recommended because interview requests are easily misplaced which is the nicest way to say those jerks just don\u2019t have time for us little people."

That way, you can see it on whatever they are signing. If you bring a black Sharpie and their CD is black how many people like the signature over the face of the band member?",
