Using your headband as a guide to help you determine the width, use a marker to freehand draw two rabbit\u2019s ear shapes on the darker felt. The ears should be approximately 7-inches (18-cm) long. For a simple looking pair of bunny ears, draw long oval shape ears. If you aren\u2019t comfortable freehand drawing the ears, you can find a variety templates online at craft websites, such as Kidspot [1]. Keep in mind that you\u2019re going to fold the edge of the ear over to conceal the wire later, so make the ears slightly wider than you want them to be. When it comes to felt colors, you might use gray, black, or brown for the darker portion of the ear and white or pink for the smaller, interior portion. You can go also go monochromatic, such as using a dark gray with a light gray. You don\u2019t necessarily have to use felt. Any fabric in two colors will work. If you want more realistic looking bunny ears, consider using faux fur."
