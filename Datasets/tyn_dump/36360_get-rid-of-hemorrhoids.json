Good sources of fiber include fruit, vegetables, whole wheat pasta and bread, wholegrain rice, seeds, nuts, and oats. Try a fiber supplement. Fiber supplement sources include psyllium husk, wheat dextrin, and methylcellulose. Taking daily supplements can help ensure you get 20 to 30 grams (0.71 to 1.1 oz) of fiber every day. Stay hydrated. Drinking enough water each day can help you regulate your bowel movements and reduce the chances of constipation. Aim for six to eight glasses each day. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, as these can affect your bowel movements. Try a stool softener. You can make a simple stool softener by adding one tablespoon (14.79 ml) of mineral oil to a soft food like applesauce or yogurt.

If you are experiencing complications associated with hemorrhoids, or if your condition does not improve after about a week with over-the-counter treatments, see a doctor immediately. Blood in your stool may indicate hemorrhoids, but it may also be a symptom of a more serious medical problem. If you find blood in your stool, contact your doctor and set up an appointment as soon as possible. Chronic and prolonged blood loss caused by hemorrhoids can lead to anemia in some people. Anemia results from a loss of red blood cells, which restricts your body's ability to carry oxygen to your cells. Symptoms of anemia include weakness and chronic fatigue. If your body's blood flow to a hemorrhoid is suddenly cut off, it can lead to a condition known as strangulated hemorrhoids.

Rubber band ligation \u2014 this minimally-invasive procedure uses tiny rubber bands to constrict blood flow to the hemorrhoid. Your doctor will place these bands around the base of the hemorrhoid, and within one week the hemorrhoid will shrivel and fall off. Sclerotherapy injection \u2014 this procedure involves a chemical injection into the inflamed tissue. It results in a shrunken hemorrhoid with reduced pain and inflammation. The injection causes relatively little pain, but may be less effective than rubber band ligation. Coagulation \u2014 this technique uses either laser, infrared light, or heat (bipolar) treatments to shrivel and harden the inflamed hemorrhoids.
