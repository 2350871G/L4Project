                    "description": "Antacids are the most commonly used over-the-counter remedy for treating the symptoms of indigestion. Antacids contain sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), and as they dissolve in the stomach they help to neutralize some of the acid that has collected there. Do not take antacids within one to two hours of administering other medications, as the sodium bicarbonate may interfere with your other medicine. Anyone on a low-sodium diet should talk to a doctor before taking antacids, as they contain a substantial amount of sodium. Avoid large quantities of milk and dairy products while taking antacids, as they may cause further discomfort and complications. Do not take antacids if you have any symptoms of appendicitis. Antacids are not recommended for long-term use. It is best to discontinue antacid use after a maximum of two weeks. If you're having chronic indigestion, talk to your doctor and consider making other lifestyle changes to reduce the incidents of indigestion."

One way to reduce the likelihood of future indigestion problems is by avoiding NSAIDs like aspirin and ibuprofen if you're prone to peptic ulcers.
