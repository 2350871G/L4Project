Provide as much of this information as you are able to. The first thing you should do is to write your address (and/or your name) in the top left corner. Write the address in standard two-line form - in other words, put your street address in the very top left corner and your city, state, and postal code on the line below it. If you choose to include your name, which is not required, put it in the very top left, rather than your address, which will then occupy the second and third lines.
