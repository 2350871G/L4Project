Blot it dry. Don't entirely dry your hair; just blot it gently with a soft towel, making sure it's no longer dripping wet. Apply gel. Any type of strong-hold hair gel will do. Use a liberal amount toward the top and front of your hair, where the finger waves will be, and spread a smaller amount throughout the rest of your hair. Part your hair. Use a fine-toothed comb to create a deep part on one side. Extend it back further than you normally would, so it almost reaches the crown of your head. Make sure it's nice and straight. Create Waves Comb your hair forward on the bigger side of the part. Leave the other side of the part, the smaller side, untouched for now. Comb your hair straight forward on the larger side. Place your forefinger parallel to the part and press down. You want to align your finger with the part and press down to keep the hair right next to the part in place.

Pinch the two fingers together and secure the hair with a metal wave clamp. The hair that lifts between your fingers is going to become a finger wave. Hold it in place with one of the metal wave clamps. The clamp should run parallel to your part. Make more waves. Comb the hair right next to the clamp forward, and hold it there with your forefinger. Comb the hair next to your forefinger backward, and hold it there with your middle finger. Pinch your fingers together and secure the hair that lifts between them with a metal wave clamp. Keep making waves until you've created waves down the top of your ear. Wave the hair on the other side of the part. Do the same thing to the other side, using your fingers and the clamps to create waves all the way to the top of your ear. Let your hair dry. Your hair should completely dry in the clamps. Don't take them out while your hair is still wet, or the waves will fall out. Finish the Look Consider the rest of your hair.
