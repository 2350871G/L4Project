Place your eggplant on a cutting board and use a chef's knife to slice off both ends by cutting widthwise across the eggplant's tips. Hold the eggplant firmly around its center with one hand as you slice with the other. Make sure to handle the knife with care to avoid accidental cuts! Though most recipes don't require it, you can peel the eggplant if you like. Slice the eggplant length-wise down the center. Cut the eggplant in half length-wise, holding the eggplant securely on its side. Flip both halves over so that they rest on their flat sides with the skin facing up. Placing the flat surface down onto the cutting board will make the eggplant more stable as you continue to cut it into cubes. Attempting to cut the eggplant as it rolls on its round side could result in accidentally cutting your fingers! Cut the eggplant halves length-wise into \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) thick slices. With the flat side facing down, cut length-wise to create slices. Position your knife so that there is around \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) in between each of your slices.

Place the eggplant on a cutting board and use a chef's knife to slice off both ends of the eggplant. Hold the eggplant firmly in one hand as you carefully slice each end. Removing the ends will get rid of the inedible parts of the eggplant and will also create two flat surfaces to stabilize your eggplant as you chop. Stand the eggplant on its end and slice length-wise to remove a layer of skin. Hold the eggplant so that it is standing straight up on your cutting board, resting on one of the flat ends you just created. Place your chef's knife at the top of the eggplant and carefully slice straight down to remove a thin layer of skin along one side of the eggplant. Rotate the eggplant 180 degrees and remove another sliver of skin from the opposite side using your knife. You do not need to remove all of the skin. Removing the skin on either side of your eggplant before you slice your planks will help to create uniform, even slices. If you'd like to remove all of the skin, you can continue making thin slices on each side of the eggplant until all of the skin is gone. Slice the eggplant from end to end. Hold the eggplant upright as it continues to rest on one flat tip and carefully push your knife through the eggplant from end to end, moving down in the direction of the cutting board. You will create long, plank-like slices of your eggplant with each slice.
