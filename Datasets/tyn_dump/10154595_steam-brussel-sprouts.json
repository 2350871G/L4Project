Pull off any yellow or brown leaves you see, then remove the tip of each sprout and cut them in half lengthwise with a sharp knife. You may want to pat the Brussels sprouts dry before you start chopping them to prevent any accidents with the knife. Boil about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water in a pot that fits your steamer. Make sure the bottom of the steamer basket isn't touching the water. That way, only steam will cook your Brussels sprouts. The basket should sit 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) over the boiling water. Place the Brussels sprouts into the basket and position the basket in the pot.
