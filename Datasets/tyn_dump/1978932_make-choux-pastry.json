Folding the collar leaves a clean top of the bag and when the folded collar is lifted up and the bag twisted closed, the filling does not come out the top. Squeeze by twisting the top of the bag further to increase pressure. Shake the bag gently to remove air pockets and then lift the collar up and twist to contain the paste. You can also make your own by using a heavy duty strength snap-lock bag and snipping the corner off one end. Line your tray with baking parchment and you are ready to go. The dough may rest reliably in the bag for up to half an hour. Pipe in your desired shape (see below sections for suggestions) and bake as follows."
