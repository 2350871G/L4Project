Look at the point of the needle too. You may want a needle with a sharp point so it can pierce fabric easily, for instance, or pick a needle with a blunt tip if you're sewing knit fabric. Consider buying a pack of needles in many different sizes, so you can try a few until you find one that's the right size."
