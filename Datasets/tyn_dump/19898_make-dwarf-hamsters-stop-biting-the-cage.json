An exercise ball is an excellent way for your hamster to get exercise every day, while also protecting him from potential household hazards. Just be sure to supervise your hamster while he's in his ball. To avoid overheating, never let your hamster roam in his ball in direct sunlight, and limit time in the ball to 15 minute intervals. Make sure you've hamster-proofed the area in which your hamster will be playing. Remove any electrical cords so he does not chew on them. Keep the area enclosed, either by closing the door to a small room or by setting up \"walls\" around your hamster's play area. If you're worried about your hamster getting into something he shouldn't, consider using a hamster ball. This will allow your pet to roam freely, while still be safely protected from potential hazards in your home. Consider giving your hamster a wheel to run on. Hamster wheels are a great way for hamsters to get exercise and work out extra energy. Avoid wire-frame wheels, as these could potentially injure your hamster."

Hamsters need to chew everyday to prevent their teeth from becoming too long, which could cause serious pain and potentially harm your pet. Untreated, paint-free, oil-free wood is the best choice for chew toys. Avoid using wood harvested from outdoors, as this wood has not been properly inspected and could harbor harmful parasites or be treated with pesticides. Wood from an apple or pear tree is ideal, as these woods do not have any harmful oils and are therefore less likely to pose any threat to your hamster's respiratory or digestive health.
