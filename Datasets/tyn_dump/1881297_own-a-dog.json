A medium sized dog could do just fine with a 20 minute walk and some throw toys. A small dog could be happy with a 30 minute game of fetch and a short walk. A large dog will probably need a long walk, a game of fetch, and some chew toys. Please provide playtime for your dog at least once a day. Don't forget or be too lazy. It only makes your dog unhappy."

            "description": "At your local pet store there should be a machine that provides pet tags for your dog. All dogs need a collar and tags to go on it. All the tag should say is the dog's name and an email or phone number to call if they are lost. If you think this step is not important, do your research! As smart as your dog might seem to be, curiosity can overcome the voice in your dog's head that tells them \"No, don't do it\". Dogs will get loose at some point in their life, and with no tags there is no one to figure out who their owner is. You will be saving your dogs physical and mental wellness by getting them tags. Microchips cannot be seen and plenty of people don't look for it or get the stray scanned for one- they only look for what's visible. So the tags are extremely important and should be taken care of right away."
