Shift the boards around until you\u2019ve aligned their grains in an attractive natural pattern. When you\u2019re satisfied with their alignment, make a big V-shape across them with chalk or a lumber crayon. For instance, if you\u2019re making a table, you\u2019ll want to use the most attractive sides of your boards or planks for the tabletop. You\u2019ll also want their grains and colors to line up so they don\u2019t look mismatched or obviously joined. The lines of your V don't have to be perfectly straight. You just need to make the shape across all of the boards. That way, the V is legible only when the boards are correctly aligned."

Make sure you\u2019ll be drilling into face or edge grain, as drilling into end grain makes for a weaker joint. You can tell the end grain from the face and edge grains by checking the texture of the surface and arrangement of the growth rings. The end grain is the rougher, more porous side of a board. In addition, the exposed radii of a tree\u2019s growth rings are only visible at the end grain. They look like a neatly arranged set of several curved lines. To complete the process, you'll drill pilot holes into a board, align it with another board, then drive screws through the first board's pilot holes and into the second board. If you\u2019ve never drilled pocket holes before, it\u2019s wise to practice on scrap wood so you can get a feel for the process."
