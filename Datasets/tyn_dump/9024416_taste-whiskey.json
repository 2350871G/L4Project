The narrower shape at the top concentrates the aromas for sniffing, while the wide bottom allows you to swirl the whiskey before you sip it. A snifter glass is the best option for whiskey tastings.

        "Keep your lips puckered in an \u201cO\u201d shape, and slide your tongue against your lips to move the whiskey around.",
        "The first few times that you try this technique, it may make you feel like gagging.",
        "That's usually due to how strong the whiskey is -- the burning sensation that it provides can make you cough, which can trigger your gag reflex.",
        "Don\u2019t try to look for any particular flavors; just see what notes you detect.",
        "Roll the whiskey in your mouth.",
        "After your initial taste, move the whiskey back and forth in your mouth like you are gargling with it.",
        "Don\u2019t do it too quickly or you may not be able to pick up all of the whiskey\u2019s flavors.",
        "Overall, you should hold the whiskey in your mouth for about 30 seconds before you swallow it to really take in all of its flavors.",
        "You'll likely taste woodsy and spicy flavors when you first take in the flavor.",
        "Depending on the type of whiskey, you may also taste hints of citrus, nuttiness, caramel, and other flavors.",
        "Swallow the whiskey and pay attention to the finish.",
        "Once you\u2019ve moved the whiskey around a little and have gotten a good taste of it, you can swallow it down.",
        "The burning feeling that you experience as it goes down is known as the finish.",
        "Try to notice exactly how it feels -- it could be short, long, mellow, or unpleasant, depending on your alcohol tolerance.",
        "A short finish doesn't linger long in the mouth so the flavor disappears quickly.",
        "A long finish lingers in the mouth so the flavor stays with you after you swallow the whiskey.",
        "A mellow finish has a smooth, pleasant flavor.",
        "An unpleasant finish may have a bitter flavor or burn as it goes down.",
        "Adding Water Use room-temperature water.",
        "After you\u2019ve tasted the whiskey neat, it\u2019s a good idea to add a little water.",
        "That helps open up the whiskey so you can pick up more of its flavors.",
        "Be sure to use room-temperature water, though, so differences in temperature don\u2019t affect the whiskey\u2019s taste.",
        "Mix still or flat water into your whiskey, not carbonated or sparkling.",
        "Add 1 drop of water to the whiskey at a time.",
        "It\u2019s important not to add too much water to the whiskey at once or you may alter its aroma and taste.",
        "Use a pipette or a straw to add just 1 drop at a time so you don\u2019t wind up diluting the whiskey rather than opening it up.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a pipette or straw, you can use the cap from your bottle of water to add a small amount at a time.",
        "If you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re picking up any new aroma or flavors from the whiskey after adding a drop of water, you can add another.",
        "Let the whiskey sit for up to 20 minutes.",
        "After adding the water, allow the whiskey to sit for as long as 20 minutes.",
        "During this time, the water slowly changes the flavor of the whiskey, which will allow you to notice more of a difference when you taste the whiskey again.",
        "Adding the water to the whiskey can help bring out subtle flavors that you didn't pick up when it was neat.",
        "For example, you may be able to taste citrus notes or a nutty flavor that you didn't detect at first tasting.",
        "The water can also help tone down the alcohol taste of the whiskey, so if it had an unpleasant finish, you may find that you like it better with the water.",
        "Sniff the whiskey again and taste it.",
        "Once the water is added to the whiskey, smell it once more.",
        "See if you can pick up any different aromas that you didn\u2019t earlier.",
        "Next, sip the whiskey in the same fashion you did earlier and look for any changes in the aroma or flavor."
