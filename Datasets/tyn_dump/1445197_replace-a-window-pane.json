The putty might need to be softened with a heat gun, which you should hold 1 inch (2.5 cm) away. Pry the old metal glazing points out of the \"rabbets.\" These are the grooves in which the glass sits. Scrape and sandpaper the rabbets until they are smooth, bare wood.

Set and center a new pane into the putty. Apply even pressure on all sides as you wiggle it into place. There should be about 1/8 inch (3 mm) of putty between the face of the glass and the rabbet. Install a glazier's point to hold the glass in place. Use a putty knife to slide a glazier's point into the center of each side of the pane, sticking the point into the wood. Turn the sash over and scrape off the putty that has squeezed out to that side.  Knead and warm a handful of putty into a long rope that is about 3/4 inch (19 mm) in diameter.
