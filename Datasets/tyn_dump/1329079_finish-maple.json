    "text": " Sanding Your Wood Cover your work surface with a drop cloth or piece of cardboard. Use a painter\u2019s drop cloth or a piece of cardboard large enough to set your piece of wood on. Make sure your entire work area is covered so you don\u2019t accidentally spill any oil or stain. Set the piece of maple you want to finish on top of the cloth before you start working.

Otherwise, you can apply a second coat of oil to make the wood grain more pronounced. You can add as many or as few coats of oil as you want to the maple. Using Wood Stain Apply a pre-stain to the wood to help the wood absorb the color. Since maple is a hardwood, the stain could be blotchy or not absorb well unless it\u2019s pretreated. Use a natural bristle brush to apply a thin layer of pre-stain to your piece. Leave the pre-stain to soak into the wood for about 10-15 minutes before wiping off any excess with a clean shop cloth. Pre-stain is available from your local hardware store. You can start staining immediately after you wipe off the pre-stain. Put the stain on with a natural bristle brush or a rag.

You don\u2019t need to apply another layer of stain if you\u2019re happy with the color of your wood. Applying a Protective Clear Coat Stir the polyurethane clear coat with a stir stick. Open the can of clear coat and use a stir stick to mix it up. Be sure not to shake the can since it could form bubbles and ruin how the clear coat applies to your piece of maple. Keep stirring the clear coat until it\u2019s thoroughly mixed. You can buy polyurethane clear coat from your local hardware store. Paint a thin layer of polyurethane onto your maple.

Don\u2019t use lower-grit sandpaper since it will scratch and damage the finish. Apply a second coat of your finish and let it dry. Put another thin coat of the polyurethane on top of the first coat. Make sure you still follow the wood grain and work out from the center of the piece. When the second coat is applied, leave it for another 4 hours so it can harden. You can apply as many coats of polyurethane as you want to make your maple glossy. Just be sure to sand in between each layer.Warning: Glossy wood will show more damage than wood with a matte finish.",
