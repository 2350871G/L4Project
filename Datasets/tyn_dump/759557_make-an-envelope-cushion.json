Making a Three-Piece Envelope Cushion Cut out a sheet of fabric for the front piece of your pillowcase. Measure your cushion, then add \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) to the length and width.

This will eventually be the back piece for your cushion. You can use the same color of fabric, or a contrasting color. You can also choose a solid color if your front piece had a pattern on it. Cut the back piece in half, widthwise. You will end up with two pieces that are \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) wider than your pillow, and several inches shorter. Fold one of the long edges over on each back piece twice to make the hem. Take one of the back pieces, and turn it so that the wrong side of the fabric is facing you. Fold one of the long edges over by \u00bc inch (0.64 centimeter) and press it flat with an iron. Fold it over by another \u00bc inch (0.64 centimeter), and press it flat once more.

They will overlap by a few inches. Pin the fabric in place, then sew along all four edges. Use a \u215c-inch (0.95-centimeter) seam allowance. Remove the sewing pins as you go.
