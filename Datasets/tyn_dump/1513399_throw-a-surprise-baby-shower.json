                    "description": "Surprise baby showers aren\u2019t for everyone, as pregnancy can be stressful and overwhelming without the added surprise of a party that they didn\u2019t know about. Try to make sure the guest of honor would truly want and like the surprise party before starting to plan it by asking close friends or family member's if the guest of honor would enjoy it. Try to ask the guest of honor's spouse or close friend if she would like a surprise baby shower in person as opposed to over text or email so the guest of honor is less likely to find out. If you want to keep it a surprise but also want the mom-to-be to feel prepared, consider telling them about the baby shower the day that it\u2019s happening. This way it\u2019s still a surprise, but they can get dressed and ready knowing they\u2019ll be around lots of people.

        "If you know the sex of the baby, you can pick out a theme relating to this, or you can go for a neutral theme such as a tiki luau, zoo animals, the circus, or the alphabet.",
        "You might choose a princess theme for a girl or a sports theme for a boy.",
        "If you wanted a beach theme, you could put up streamers in shades of blue to recreate the ocean, have a cake that looks like a sand castle, and put the party favors in little beach buckets.",
        "You can also opt for a color theme, such as gray, yellow, green, or purple.",
        "Plan the menu for the party.",
        "You\u2019ll want to pick out food for the guests to eat, along with a cake and drinks (both non-alcoholic and alcoholic, if desired).",

        "Consider having an afternoon cookout where you serve mini sliders, chips, and veggie and fruit platters.",

        "If you\u2019re planning a party with a gray and yellow color scheme, purchase streamers, plates, and party favors in these colors.",
        "For a barn-themed baby shower, have the guests place the presents in a wheelbarrow, purchase plates with farm animals on them, or give the guests Peeps as a party favor.",
