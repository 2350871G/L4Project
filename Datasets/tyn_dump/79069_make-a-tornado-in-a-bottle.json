If you are making a two-bottle tornado, you'll need to find a watertight way to fix the openings so that they face one another. Try using superglue, caulk, duct tape, or a large rubber band. Making a One-Bottle Tornado Make sure that the bottle is sealed. The trick won't work well unless the container is completely airtight. Test the cap with your hand. Spin the bottle. Hold it by the top or the bottom, and use your wrist to shake the water in a loose circular vortex. After a few seconds of spinning, you should see the water begin to swirl in the center. This is your \"tornado.\" Ask questions:\nWhy is it spinning? Is the tornado spinning clockwise or counterclockwise? How does the glitter interact with the tornado? Experiment. Try spinning the bottle slower or faster. Try spinning it upside down. Observe whether changing the spin pattern has any effect on how the tornado looks. Learn why the water is spinning. It is responding to \"centripetal force\" \u2013 an inward-facing force that pulls an object or liquid toward the center of its circular path. In this case, the water is spinning around the \"center\" of the vortex, which happens to be the center of the bottle because the bottle defines the size of the \"body of water.\" Making a Two-Bottle Tornado Make sure that the two bottles are attached at the mouth. The connection should be airtight and watertight. Set the bottles upright so that the bottom of the full bottle is sitting on the ground or table, and the bottom of the empty bottle is sticking straight up into the air. Be sure to leave an inch or two of air at the top of the \"full\" bottle. Flip the bottles upside-down. Think of it like the motion of flipping an hourglass. The bottom bottle should now be empty of water, and the top bottle should be full of water. Hold the bottles for support \u2013 the contraption will be top-heavy! Watch the water trickle down. The air pressure in the now-top bottle is lower than the air pressure in the now-bottom bottle, so there should not be much water flowing between the mouths of the bottles. Swirl the water-filled bottle in circles. If you gently spin the water-filled bottle on top, water should begin to pour again. This should create a vortex or \"tornado\" in the center of the water-filled bottle as the liquid flows from a space of low pressure to a space of high pressure.",
