You want it to be fairly thick with small lumps, almost like the consistency of cottage cheese or porridge. Make sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions for using the drill.

Add a bit more of the textured ceiling mixture until you reach the desired consistency. Alternatively, if it is too thick, you can add a bit more water. Applying the Popcorn Ceiling Fill the texturing gun with the ceiling spray. Fill the texture gun about half way with the ceiling mixture. Test the spray on a piece of cardboard. Before you begin spraying the ceiling, you can test the spray pattern on a piece of cardboard or drywall. This will give you a feel for the spray gun and you can try making a few even strokes. Spray the ceiling evenly in a back and forth motion. To apply the spray to the ceiling, hold the gun approximately 18 inches (46 cm) from the ceiling. Slowly move the gun back and forth in an even manner. This way you will apply the textured ceiling evenly. Start in one corner and then work your way across the room. Use a trowel to reach the corners and edges. If you are having difficulty reaching the corners with the spray, you can use a trowel to push the textured mixture into the corners.
