If you don\u2019t have one, you can also pop your corn in a pan or skillet on your stove top or put kernels into paper bag semi-closed in the microwave or 2:30 minutes . To figure out how much popcorn you\u2019ll need for your garland, keep in mind that 1 cup typically covers 3 to 4 feet of thread. If you pop the corn in pan, you\u2019ll need to add a little oil to the bottom to help the corn cook. To prevent it from becoming soggy, place the corn on a paper towel-lined plate or dish when you remove it from the pan, so some of the oil will be absorbed. When you\u2019re in a hurry, you can use microwave popcorn or a pre-popped bag. Just make sure that it has no salt or butter."

Get creative with your garlands by mixing the popcorn with other items, such as fresh cranberries, dried orange, lemon, or lime slices, and cinnamon sticks. You can create striking patterns by alternating the other items with the popcorn. Fresh cranberries start to go bad after a couple of days, though, so you\u2019ll want to spray the garland with shellac before putting it on the tree.
