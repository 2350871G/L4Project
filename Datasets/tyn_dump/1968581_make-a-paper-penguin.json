Then fold the paper in half diagonally so the bottom left corner is flush with the top right corner and make a crease. Unfold the paper and do the same with the opposite corners, and then unfold the page again. When you unfold the sheet again, you will have creases forming a large X across the page."

    "text": " Making an Origami Penguin Purchase origami paper. This method calls for just a single sheet of 6\u201d x 6\u201d origami paper. If you want a larger penguin, then you can easily go for 12\u201d x 12\u201d paper, but you'll have to multiply any directions containing measurements by two. If you want an even better looking penguin, buy paper that is white on one side and black on the other. Fold diagonal creases along the middle. To start, you want to place the sheet of origami paper flat (with the white side facing up if you have paper with a black side as well). Then fold the paper in half diagonally so the bottom left corner is flush with the top right corner and make a crease. Unfold the paper and do the same with the opposite corners, and then unfold the page again. When you unfold the sheet again, you will have creases forming a large X across the page. Fold the lower left corner to the center. With the page flat again and the large creases making an X, you will then take the lower left corner of the paper and fold it so that the tip of the corner touches the center of the page. In other words, the corner edge will touch the center of the X made by the earlier creases. Flatten the folded portion and make another crease, then open the sheet so it's flat again. Fold the upper right corner to the crease you just made. You will now have the large X crease as well as a smaller diagonal crease in the lower left of the page. Take the top right corner of the page and fold it over so that it touches the lower left crease. Then open the page once more. Turn the page over. For the next set of folds, you'll need to turn the page over. If you have two-colored paper, this means that the black side will now faces up. When you turn the paper over, orient it diagonally so that the current lower left corner now points up. Fold the left corner to the right corner. With the paper in the new orientation, take the corner pointing left and fold the paper in half so that it's flush with the corner pointing right. There will already be a crease here from when you made this fold on the other side of the sheet, but you'll need to crease it in the opposite direction when you fold it over. Fold the bottom corner over to the right. From the last step, the sheet will now look like a triangle with the side on the left forming a vertical line. Take the corner of the triangle that points down and fold it across at a 45\u00b0 angle. Fold it so that the horizontal edge made at the top of the fold touches the lower crease already on this part of the page\u2014not the middle crease but the one below it. Once you've made the crease from this fold, turn the flap back over so that you have the same triangle shape you started with. Reverse-fold the corner along the crease you just made. A reverse fold is a bit more three-dimensional than the other folds you've made so far. In order to make the reverse fold, take the crease you just made and crease it in the opposite direction, but make the crease by folding and tucking the corner into the paper. Since reverse folds can be hard to visualize as written instructions, you can find the exact fold in question here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHQMzLUQMmg#t=80. Fold the top half over. With the reverse fold out of the way, you want to take the corner pointing right\u2014just the top layer not both layers\u2014and fold it back on itself.

When you do, you want to orient the paper so that the really narrow point is pointing upward. Fold the narrow point over to the left. With the paper oriented so that the long, narrow point face up, take that point and fold it over at a 45\u00b0 angle so that the point now points to the left. You'll see how this fold starts to take shape as the penguin's beak. After making the crease in this fold, return the point to the upward position. Reverse-fold along the crease you just made. This step requires you to make an outside reverse fold along the crease you made in the last step. An outside reverse fold is slightly different from the earlier reverse fold. To make the fold, unfold the paper along the black side slightly, and poke your finger from the white side at the fold you made in the last step. When the creases reverse direction, simply reform the fold so that the two black sides of the sheet are in contact again. Once again, reverse folds can be a bit difficult to describe. You can find the exact movement at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHQMzLUQMmg#t=127. Fold the wing over. Though clearly visible now, the wings won't quite look perfect yet.

Pull it back far enough so that it's just shy of where the little tail is at the bottom of the paper. Fold the wing back over on itself. Once you've made the crease from the previous step, fold the wing back over on itself so that the black side is once again facing up. Fold it so that the tip of the corner is just shy of touching the horizontal white edge at the bottom of the body. Makes a rabbit's ear fold. To make the rabbit's ear fold, lift the portion of the wing you just folder and reverse the crease from the last step, but only at the bottom of the crease and only at the depth of roughly the tip of your finger. This will makes the bottom tip of the wing into a little flap though the flat edge will still be parallel to the rest of the wing. As with the other complex folds, a visual can help, which you will find here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHQMzLUQMmg#t=156. Repeat steps 14-16 for the other wing. With one wing complete, you're ready to turn the page over and repeat the same steps to form the other wing. Simply use the same folds from steps 14-16 but on the other side. Tuck in the points at the bottom. The bottom of the penguin will still have points sticking out in a slightly misshapen way. Fold each of these points toward the inside of the penguin to make a flat, horizontal bottom to the body. Once you tuck these flaps up, you have your penguin! Making a Craft Penguin for Children Get one white, one black, and one orange sheet of construction paper. Since origami can be a bit difficult (and not very exciting) for younger children, the good old method of cutting and gluing construction paper might be more up their alley. This method of making a paper penguin calls for one white, one black, and one orange sheet of construction paper. Trace an oval shape onto the black construction paper. To form the body of the penguin, have the child draw an oblong oval on the black construction paper with either a white crayon or a piece of chalk so that they can see the outline. One fun and silly way to help the child make the shape is to have him or her place their shoe on the sheet and trace the outline of it. Cut out the black oval. Using a pair of scissors (safety scissors for younger children), have the child cut out the black oval from the construction paper. When it comes to the eyes later, you can have the child either draw them on the white paper or cut pupils out of the black paper. For the latter, you can have the child cut those out now as well. Trace a smaller oval onto the white construction paper. You can now have the child trace the white portion of the belly on the white construction paper. You can find something of the relative oblong shape to let the child trace it again or simply allow them to do it freehand. Glue the belly to the rest of the body. Once the child is done tracing the white oval, allow them to cut the shape out of the construction paper. Then use a glue stick to glue the tummy portion to the rest of the body. Glue it closer to the bottom of the body portion than the middle since the head should be above it. Cut a small triangle out of the orange construction paper. To make the beak for the penguin, have the child cut a small triangle out of the orange construction paper. The beak doesn't have to be an exact triangle, so you can have the child trace it first or simply cut one out. For very small children, the size of the beak might be too difficult for them to cut out, so you may have to help with this step. Glue the beak to the penguin's face. You have two different options to glue the beak to the penguin's face. You can either glue the triangle flat with one of the points facing downward, or you can actually make a little fold on one of the flat sides and glue it at the tab, which will make the beak stick out from the penguin's face.

        "Take the top right corner of the page and fold it over so that it touches the lower left crease.",
        "Then open the page once more.",
        "Turn the page over.",
        "For the next set of folds, you'll need to turn the page over.",
        "If you have two-colored paper, this means that the black side will now faces up.",
        "When you turn the paper over, orient it diagonally so that the current lower left corner now points up.",
        "Fold the left corner to the right corner.",
        "With the paper in the new orientation, take the corner pointing left and fold the paper in half so that it's flush with the corner pointing right.",
        "There will already be a crease here from when you made this fold on the other side of the sheet, but you'll need to crease it in the opposite direction when you fold it over.",
        "Fold the bottom corner over to the right.",
        "From the last step, the sheet will now look like a triangle with the side on the left forming a vertical line.",
        "Take the corner of the triangle that points down and fold it across at a 45\u00b0 angle.",
        "Fold it so that the horizontal edge made at the top of the fold touches the lower crease already on this part of the page\u2014not the middle crease but the one below it.",
        "Once you've made the crease from this fold, turn the flap back over so that you have the same triangle shape you started with.",
        "Reverse-fold the corner along the crease you just made.",
        "A reverse fold is a bit more three-dimensional than the other folds you've made so far.",
        "In order to make the reverse fold, take the crease you just made and crease it in the opposite direction, but make the crease by folding and tucking the corner into the paper.",
        "Since reverse folds can be hard to visualize as written instructions, you can find the exact fold in question here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHQMzLUQMmg#t=80.",
        "Fold the top half over.",
        "With the reverse fold out of the way, you want to take the corner pointing right\u2014just the top layer not both layers\u2014and fold it back on itself.",
        "Fold it so that the flat side just above the corner lines up flush with the flat vertical line on the left side of the paper.",
        "Make a crease here, but do not unfold the flap.",
        "Leave it folded.",
        "Turn the page over and make the same fold on the other side.",
        "You now want to turn the paper over completely and make the same fold you just made but from the other side.",
        "In other words, fold the other corner (the bottom layer from the previous step) over so that its upper edge is also flush with the same flat side of the page.",
        "Especially if you're using a two-colored sheet of paper, this step will make more sense because the form of the penguin will start to become more apparent as the black side of the page will face outward on both sides.",
        "As the project continues to take shape, these will be the wings.",
        "Turn the paper over again.",
        "To prepare for the next major fold, you will need to turn the whole paper over again.",
        "When you do, you want to orient the paper so that the really narrow point is pointing upward.",
        "Fold the narrow point over to the left.",
        "With the paper oriented so that the long, narrow point face up, take that point and fold it over at a 45\u00b0 angle so that the point now points to the left.",
        "You'll see how this fold starts to take shape as the penguin's beak.",
        "After making the crease in this fold, return the point to the upward position.",
        "Reverse-fold along the crease you just made.",
        "This step requires you to make an outside reverse fold along the crease you made in the last step.",
        "An outside reverse fold is slightly different from the earlier reverse fold.",
        "To make the fold, unfold the paper along the black side slightly, and poke your finger from the white side at the fold you made in the last step.",
        "When the creases reverse direction, simply reform the fold so that the two black sides of the sheet are in contact again.",
        "Once again, reverse folds can be a bit difficult to describe.",
        "You can find the exact movement at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHQMzLUQMmg#t=127.",
        "Fold the wing over.",
        "Though clearly visible now, the wings won't quite look perfect yet.",
        "Take the wing on the side facing up and fold it over so that the white side faces out.",
        "You'll fold it back so that the corner which was facing the bottom left now points to the right.",
        "Pull it back far enough so that it's just shy of where the little tail is at the bottom of the paper.",
        "Fold the wing back over on itself.",
        "Once you've made the crease from the previous step, fold the wing back over on itself so that the black side is once again facing up.",
        "Fold it so that the tip of the corner is just shy of touching the horizontal white edge at the bottom of the body.",
        "Makes a rabbit's ear fold.",
        "To make the rabbit's ear fold, lift the portion of the wing you just folder and reverse the crease from the last step, but only at the bottom of the crease and only at the depth of roughly the tip of your finger.",
        "This will makes the bottom tip of the wing into a little flap though the flat edge will still be parallel to the rest of the wing.",
        "As with the other complex folds, a visual can help, which you will find here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHQMzLUQMmg#t=156.",
        "Repeat steps 14-16 for the other wing.",
        "With one wing complete, you're ready to turn the page over and repeat the same steps to form the other wing.",
        "Simply use the same folds from steps 14-16 but on the other side.",
        "Tuck in the points at the bottom.",
        "The bottom of the penguin will still have points sticking out in a slightly misshapen way.",
        "Fold each of these points toward the inside of the penguin to make a flat, horizontal bottom to the body.",
        "Once you tuck these flaps up, you have your penguin!",
        "Making a Craft Penguin for Children Get one white, one black, and one orange sheet of construction paper.",
        "Since origami can be a bit difficult (and not very exciting) for younger children, the good old method of cutting and gluing construction paper might be more up their alley.",
        "This method of making a paper penguin calls for one white, one black, and one orange sheet of construction paper.",
        "Trace an oval shape onto the black construction paper.",
        "To form the body of the penguin, have the child draw an oblong oval on the black construction paper with either a white crayon or a piece of chalk so that they can see the outline.",
        "One fun and silly way to help the child make the shape is to have him or her place their shoe on the sheet and trace the outline of it.",
        "Cut out the black oval.",
        "Using a pair of scissors (safety scissors for younger children), have the child cut out the black oval from the construction paper.",
        "When it comes to the eyes later, you can have the child either draw them on the white paper or cut pupils out of the black paper.",
        "For the latter, you can have the child cut those out now as well.",
        "Trace a smaller oval onto the white construction paper.",
        "You can now have the child trace the white portion of the belly on the white construction paper.",
        "You can find something of the relative oblong shape to let the child trace it again or simply allow them to do it freehand.",
        "Glue the belly to the rest of the body.",
        "Once the child is done tracing the white oval, allow them to cut the shape out of the construction paper.",
        "Then use a glue stick to glue the tummy portion to the rest of the body.",
        "Glue it closer to the bottom of the body portion than the middle since the head should be above it.",
        "Cut a small triangle out of the orange construction paper.",
        "To make the beak for the penguin, have the child cut a small triangle out of the orange construction paper.",
        "The beak doesn't have to be an exact triangle, so you can have the child trace it first or simply cut one out.",
        "For very small children, the size of the beak might be too difficult for them to cut out, so you may have to help with this step.",
        "Glue the beak to the penguin's face.",
        "You have two different options to glue the beak to the penguin's face.",
        "You can either glue the triangle flat with one of the points facing downward, or you can actually make a little fold on one of the flat sides and glue it at the tab, which will make the beak stick out from the penguin's face.",
        "Make the penguin's eyes.",
        "As mentioned earlier, you can have the child draw eyes on the white construction paper, cut them out and glue those to the penguin, or you can also have the child cut the whites of the eyes from the white construction paper, then use the black construction paper to cut out the pupils.",
        "A third option if the child is too young to cut out such small circles is to have some googly eyes on hand from a craft store or the craft section of a big-box store.",
        "Young kids may have an easier time using a glue stick to attach google eyes instead.",
        "Let the child customize it.",
        "This makes an easy basic shape for the penguin, and then the child can have fun customizing it.",
        "If the child cuts out two really flattened ovals from the black paper, he or she can glue them to the side of the body as wings.",
        "If the child wants to make feet for the penguin, you can have them trace a leaf or something else with the slight contours to give them the webbed shape."
