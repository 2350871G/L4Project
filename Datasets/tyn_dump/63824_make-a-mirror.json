        "Don\u2019t worry about the color, however; you can always paint it.",
        "This method is similar to the basic mirror method, except that it has a spooky twist: a haunted face caught inside the glass!",
        "Paint the frame, if desired.",
        "Since this will be a haunted mirror, you might as well crank up the spook factor.",
        "Shake the can first, then hold it 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 cm) away from the frame.",
        "Apply 2 thin coats of paint, allowing each one to dry.",
        "Set the frame aside so that it can dry completely.",
        "Be sure to work in a well-ventilated area, preferably outside.",
        "Black paint will look the best, but you can use other colors as well.",
        "If the frame is still not spooky enough, hot glue some fake spiders to it.",
        "Black, purple, or blood-red rhinestones will also give it a spooky feel.",
        "Clean the glass panel using rubbing alcohol.",
        "Soak a paper towel or soft cloth with rubbing alcohol, then use it to wipe down both sides of the glass panel.",
        "Handle the glass panel by the side edges from now on, otherwise you may get fingerprints or oils over it, which can prevent the paint from sticking.",
        "Find a spooky, black-and-white portrait with a dark background.",
        "Old, Victorian photographs work especially well.",
        "You can also print out a photo of a ghoul, zombie, or skeleton.",
        "You want it to look like the person in the photo is inside the mirror, so choose wisely!",
        "The image needs to be smaller than your glass panel.",
        "Print 2 copies of the image, with one of them being reversed.",
        "Print out the image first.",
        "Next, download it to an image editing program.",
        "Select the image, then use the editing tool to flip the image to the left or right.",
        "Print out the second image when you are done.",
        "Most computers come with a free image editing program, such as Paint (for Windows).",
        "You can also use an image editing website.",
        "Tape the reversed image to the glass panel.",
        "Set the glass panel over the image, then secure the paper to the edges with tape.",
        "You will be painting only part of the glass panel.",
        "The part that you leave bare will allow the spooky image to show through.",
        "Taping the reversed image to the glass will help you know which parts to leave bare.",
        "Flip the glass panel over and apply a thin coat of mirror-effect spray paint.",
        "Turn the glass over so that the taped image is on the back.",
        "Apply a single light coat of mirror-effect spray paint over the entire glass panel.",
        "Hold the can 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 cm) away from the glass and use a side-to-side sweeping motion.",
        "You should still see the image through it.",
        "This step will give a mirror-like sheen to your image.",
        "If your image is very dark, the light coat may darken it even more.",
        "In this case, skip this step and move onto the next.",
        "You must use mirror-effect or mirror-finish spray paint.",
        "It will say so on the label.",
        "Do not use regular silver spray paint, even if the cap is shiny; it will not work.",
        "Apply more thin coats of mirror paint around the image.",
        "Decide which parts of the image you want to show up in the mirror: the entire face or just the screaming mouth?",
        "What about a grabbing hand?",
        "Spray the glass panel, taking care to avoid these areas.",
        "Allow each coat to dry for 1 minute before applying the next one.",
        "Plan on using about 5 thin coats total.",
        "Make sure that you cover enough of the glass panel so that it will still look like a mirror from the front!",
        "Don't worry if you overlap some areas that you meant to leave bare.",
        "This will make the mirror look more realistic.",
        "Allow the paint to dry completely before removing the taped image.",
        "How long the paint takes to dry depends on where you live; the warmer it is, the faster it will dry.",
        "Once the paint has dried, flip the glass over and remove the taped image.",
        "Discard the image so that you don't get it mixed up with the right one in the next step.",
        "The paint will take about 1 hour to dry completely.",
        "Set the glass panel into the frame, painted side up.",
        "Flip the frame over so that the inside is facing you.",
        "Set the glass panel down into the frame with the painted side facing you.",
        "This is very important.",
        "Don't worry, the paint will show through the glass in the end.",
        "The glass will protect the paint and make it shinier.",
        "Insert the spooky image, face-down, then close the frame.",
        "Set the spooky image face-down on top of the painted glass.",
        "Make sure that it is oriented the right way, then place the frame's back panel on top.",
        "Slide the hooks back into place.",
        "If the image is not oriented the right way, then the parts you wanted to show through may end up being covered by paint.",
        "Use the frame as part of your d\u00e9cor.",
        "Flip the frame over and hang it up or stand it up on a table.",
        "The paint and the image will show through the glass.",
        "The paint will make it reflective, just like a real mirror, but the spooky image will peek through the patches that you left bare!",
        "Drape a fake cobweb over a corner, then attach the other end of the cobweb to the wall behind the frame or the edge of the table."
