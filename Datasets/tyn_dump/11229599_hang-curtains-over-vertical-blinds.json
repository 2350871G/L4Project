You can hang curtains from the tension rod and install them within minutes. Depending on the setup behind the cornice, you could even use a wooden dowel to hang the curtains. If your blinds don\u2019t have a cornice, you could make one yourself to elevate the look of your room even more.Tip: Tension rods aren\u2019t made to hold a lot of weight, so they\u2019re best used to hang sheer or very light curtains."
