You will need to buy at least three ounces of chocolate for the bath mixture. A few brands of dark chocolate you can use are Godiva, Lindt, and Ghirardelli. The chocolate can be in candy bar or block form. You should be able to find these brands at a supermarket, along with other brands of dark chocolate. If you can\u2019t find these brands, look for a brand with a lower amount of sugar and high amount of cocoa. Some brands, like Hershey and Dove, have high amounts of sugar and lower amounts of cocoa, which makes them less pure. Dark chocolate is great for bubble baths because of the lower amounts of sugar compared to milk chocolate, and the antioxidants coming from the cocoa."
