Making Homemade Dumpling Wrappers Mix 2 cups (256 g) of flour and 1/2 teaspoon (2.8 g) of salt together. Pour the flour and salt into a mixing bowl.

You may need to let the dough cool for 2 to 3 minutes before kneading it if your hands are sensitive to heat. Cover the dough in plastic wrap and let it sit for 30 minutes. Wrap the dough tightly with plastic wrap and set it somewhere that is room temperature. Wait at least 30 minutes to let the dough soften. Use a kitchen timer or the clock app on your phone to keep track of the time. Roll 2 tbsp (28 g) of dough between your hands to form a sphere. Pull off a piece of dough and lightly roll it between the palms of your hands. Do this until the dough is the shape of a small ball. For larger wrappers, pinch off more than 2 tbsp (28 g) of dough. For smaller wrappers, use less. Use a rolling pin to flatten the sphere into a \u204416 in (1.6 mm) thick circle. Place the sphere of dough on a clean, flat surface. Then, roll it out using a rolling pin until it\u2019s no more than  \u204416 inch (1.6 mm) thick. Check that the entire wrapper is an even thickness.
