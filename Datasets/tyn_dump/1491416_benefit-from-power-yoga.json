                    "description": "Whatever your level, yoga starts with breathing. Breathing properly will help you keep your rhythm throughout your practice, know your limits and maintain good habits. When your breathing and your asanas (poses) are in perfect sync, you'll really feel the flow of power yoga. It is common to hold your breath or use short, shallow breathing when exercising or holding a pose. However, this causes body tension and stress, the opposite of what you want for optimal well-being. There are multiple ways to breathe during poses, depending on the teacher. Find a proper breathing method that works for you. Most yogic traditions recommend deep, belly breathing as a foundation. This type of breathing causes your abdomen to rise as you inhale and lower as you exhale. You inhale and exhale through your nose slowly, while counting seconds silently\u2014inhale for 5 counts and exhale for 5 more before starting a new breath. Paying attention to your breathing helps you stay focused and relaxed when you practice yoga."

                    "description": "Power yoga has roots in Ashtanga Yoga practices, which utilizes \u201cthe victorious breath\u201d technique for breath control. Breathing this way utilizes sound and movement with exercises to promote wellbeing. First, sit down with a straight spine and eyes closed. Take a deep breath slowly through your nose. Exhale through your mouth. Make the sound \u201cHAAA.\u201d Next time you exhale, close your mouth and make the same sound in your throat. Keep your throat relaxed and inhale while generating the same sound. It might sound a little like Darth Vader from Star Wars, but don't aim to be the loudest one in the room. Instead, think of breathing as a massage for your vocal cords. Now lift your arms when you inhale. Lower your arms when you exhale. Rest your hands in your lap and breathe. Repeat. Return to normal breathing when you are finished. After practice, you will be able to use this breathing technique as you perform poses. It's beneficial for the body because it helps muscles get oxygen more efficiently and allows you do to more physically without fatiguing."

Meditation reduces blood pressure, anxiety, insomnia, depression and flu infections. Find a comfortable place. You can lay down or sit\u2014it doesn't matter as long as you are comfortable. Close your eyes and pay attention to your breathing. Breathe in for 5 seconds and out for 5 seconds. Clear your mind or focus on a particular sound, object, word or phrase. You could also imagine a place that makes you happy\u2014such as a beach, an old memory or an imagined place. Whenever your mind drifts to other thoughts, gently bring it back to whatever it is you have chosen to focus on. Meditate for as long as you want\u2014a few minutes to an hour or longer. There will be a lot of distractions at first but soon you will be able to meditate for longer periods of time."

Good nutrition nourishes your body, gives you energy, helps you concentrate, keeps your weight balanced and allows you to practice yoga effectively. Focus on natural foods, such as fruit, whole grains, seeds, nuts, beans, and vegetables. Never eat your food in a rush or while in a stressful environment. Avoid processed, fried and artificial foods. These include artificial sweeteners, sugary foods like donuts, foods made from white flour and drinks like soda. Don't eat salty, overly processed canned foods. Only eat canned food if it is naturally canned without chemical preservatives. Avoid alcohol, tobacco, and genetically engineered food. Also, don't eat foods that have been over cooked or microwaved. Consider a vegetarian diet. For ethical, spiritual and health reasons, it may be beneficial for you to only eat food that does not cause harm to animals. Yoga promotes love, compassion and the concept of non-harm for all living beings, including animals. Some yoga practitioners believe that eating meat is more difficult to digest and causes disharmony and tension in the body. Do natural movement exercises. Swimming, dance, walking, and pilates are all good choices to compliment your Power Yoga practice. The core strength developed in pilates, for example, can provide enhanced stability with yoga poses. You will want to do Power Yoga at least 3 times a week but adding other exercises to your weekly routine can be fun and add variety. You may want to avoid weight training, which some feel can stiffen muscles and reduce your ability to perform yoga as well. Cultivate gratitude. Be grateful for the chance to live life and all the wonderful experiences and relationships available to you. Before you consume any food or while preparing food, remember to feel grateful for what you will be eating. Every day, before you go to bed, think over all the good things that happened to you that day. Be thankful for a roof over your head, clean water to drink, for love and kindness and anything else you can think of.",
