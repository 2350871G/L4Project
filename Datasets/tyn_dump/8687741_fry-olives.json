You can use unstuffed olives or, for extra flavor, purchase garlic-stuffed olives. Mix ingredients for dredging in three separate dishes.

Drain the olives, pit them if necessary, and pat them dry with a paper towel if they were jarred in any liquid other than oil. Roll small amounts of blue cheese into narrow log shapes. Stuff each olive with a small cheese log. Dredge the olives in flour, egg, and breadcrumbs. Place the flour, egg, and breadcrumbs into three separate shallow dishes.
