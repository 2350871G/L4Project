Place the toys in the crib and encourage your baby to reach for them through the bars. After some time passes, place your baby in the crib to grab the toys. By placing toys in the crib, you establish it as a safe, \"fun\" environment. Do not let your baby play for too long in the crib, though. Your child needs to see the crib as a pleasant place, but you should not establish it as a place for play and activity.

Julie Wright, MFT\t\t\tParenting & Baby Sleep Specialist\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: Any time you're transitioning your child, it helps to give them a little play time in the new environment. For instance, you might put toys in the crib, then spend some time in there when you're baby is happy, fed, and rested. That will help create a positive association, so they'll have a sense of where they are while they're sleeping."

For instance, if your baby takes two naps, you can let your baby take one nap wherever they usually sleep. Place your baby in the crib for the other nap, though. Once your baby becomes comfortable sleeping in the crib for one nap, put them in the crib for both. Being left alone in the dark could be a major cause for your baby's fear. As such, letting your baby adjust to the crib during the day, when they can see more, can greatly reduce initial crib anxiety."

In some cases, you might be able to simply leave your baby alone in the crib as you would for a nap. They may fuss at first, but after several minutes, your baby might fall asleep without much difficulty.

If your baby is used to sleeping in your room, the scariest part about transitioning to the crib might be the change in surroundings. By moving the crib into your room for several weeks, you allow your baby time to adjust to the crib in an otherwise comfortable setting. Your baby may still have trouble adjusting to the crib if it is placed on the far side of your room. If this happens, you may need to compromise further by positioning the crib directly next to your bed. Once your baby becomes comfortable sleeping next to you in the crib, gradually move the crib further and further away within the room. When your baby is comfortable sleeping in the crib in your room, and has been so for roughly a week, it is time to move the crib back into baby's room."

By spending a few nights in your baby's room as they fall asleep, you can help to establish that room as a safe place.

When your baby feels comfortable with the distance, move your chair back a little further. Each time your baby adjusts to the change in distance, move back a little more until, eventually, you are out of sight.

Gradually decrease the amount of time you spend rocking your baby until, eventually, your baby is able to fall asleep simply by being held and not by being rocked.

Oftentimes, babies have an easier time napping in baby swings or car seats than a crib. This is mostly due to the fact that these spaces are more enclosed, thereby mimicking the feeling of being held in mom's or dad's arms. While these spaces should not be used for naps indefinitely, they can be helpful in transitioning your baby from napping in your arms to  sleeping alone. Once your baby adjusts to sleeping alone in a confined space, you can start placing them in the open space of a crib during nap time."

Filling your baby's day with stimulating play and other activities will naturally make your baby feel more tired and worn out at night. As a result, your baby will be less likely to kick up a fuss about where they are sleeping. It might be especially helpful to plan an activity an hour before bedtime to burn off extra energy. Give your baby a warm bath before bed. Baths often have a soothing effect, and a warm bath can soothe your baby's muscles, making them feel physically relaxed. If your baby becomes more alert after taking a bath, however, you should avoid baths before bed. Try giving your baby a gentle massage. Gently rub your baby's back, arms, and legs to relax the muscles. If this seems to invigorate your child, though, skip this action."

Removing these sources of discomfort will make it easier for your baby to sleep anywhere. Give your baby a little food before bed. Roughly 2 or 3 oz (60 or 90 ml) of formula or breast milk can fill your baby's stomach enough to prevent them from getting hungry a few hours after falling asleep. For babies who are at least six months old, give them 1 or 2 Tbsp (15 or 30 ml) of cereal to accomplish the same task. Make it easier for your baby to breathe by introducing an air purifier or air filter into the room. Contaminants from fuzzy blankets or pets can get into the air, making it hard for your baby to breathe comfortably. An air purifier will remove most of these problems. The \"white noise\" from the purifier can also have a calming effect. Change your baby's diaper. Make sure that your baby has a clean diaper on immediately before going to bed. Use \"nighttime\" diapers to prevent waste from leaking out and soaking your baby's pajamas. Minimize teething pain. If you have your doctor's permission, you can give your child a small dose of acetaminophen to relieve the pain. Make sure your baby has comfortable pajamas. Babies with especially sensitive skin tend to do better in nightclothes made from 100 percent cotton than they do in clothes made from synthetic fabrics."

As a result, it will be easier for baby to feel comfortable enough to sleep in their crib. Dim the lights. Many young babies can sleep with a little light, but others associate light with being awake and active. Keep the lights off in your baby's room and limit your use of the hallway light while your baby is trying to fall asleep. If your baby is especially sensitive to light, use opaque shades to keep the sunlight out of your baby's room in the morning. Reduce noise. Most babies can sleep through a little noise, but it is generally a good idea to keep things quiet while your baby is drifting off. Otherwise, they may feel as though there is too much action going on to fall asleep. Do not let your television or radio share a wall with your baby's crib, and keep the volume as soft as possible when these devices are in use. Keep your voices low, and avoid having guests over while your baby is trying to fall asleep. Play soothing music. Try playing recorded lullabies, or place plush toys that play classical music or other soothing sounds in your baby's crib at night. Soft music has a rhythmic quality that proves very effective in helping many babies drift to sleep. Give your baby something with your scent on it, like a frequently-worn t-shirt. The scent will be familiar, making the crib feel more comfortable and familiar, as well. You may want to remove the item once your baby falls asleep, however, to prevent them from accidentally suffocating on it."

During the day, put toys in your baby's crib for them to reach for. Do this during play time, not nap time. Place the toys in the crib and encourage your baby to reach for them through the bars. After some time passes, place your baby in the crib to grab the toys. By placing toys in the crib, you establish it as a safe, \"fun\" environment. Do not let your baby play for too long in the crib, though. Your child needs to see the crib as a pleasant place, but you should not establish it as a place for play and activity.

Julie is a licensed psychotherapist specializing in babies, children, and their parents, and the co-author of two best selling parenting books (The Happy Sleeper and Now Say This) published by Penguin Random House. She created the popular Wright Mommy, Daddy and Me program in Los Angeles, California, which provides support and learning for new parents. Julie's work has been mentioned in The New York Times, The Washington Post, and NPR. Julie received her training at the Cedars Sinai Early Childhood Center. Julie Wright, MFT\t\t\tParenting & Baby Sleep Specialist\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: Any time you're transitioning your child, it helps to give them a little play time in the new environment. For instance, you might put toys in the crib, then spend some time in there when you're baby is happy, fed, and rested. That will help create a positive association, so they'll have a sense of where they are while they're sleeping. Establish that the crib is a place for sleep during the day. Once your baby gets over their anxiety toward the crib, start holding nap time in the crib. This can be done gradually. For instance, if your baby takes two naps, you can let your baby take one nap wherever they usually sleep. Place your baby in the crib for the other nap, though. Once your baby becomes comfortable sleeping in the crib for one nap, put them in the crib for both. Being left alone in the dark could be a major cause for your baby's fear. As such, letting your baby adjust to the crib during the day, when they can see more, can greatly reduce initial crib anxiety. Ease your baby into sleeping in the crib at night. After your baby feels comfortable sleeping in the crib for naps, you can start placing your child in the crib at night. In some cases, you might be able to simply leave your baby alone in the crib as you would for a nap. They may fuss at first, but after several minutes, your baby might fall asleep without much difficulty. If your baby still exhibits signs of crib anxiety, you might need to take additional steps to introduce your baby to the idea of sleeping in the crib at night. Move the crib into your room. Place the crib next to your bed so that your baby can still see you as they fall asleep. If your baby is used to sleeping in your room, the scariest part about transitioning to the crib might be the change in surroundings. By moving the crib into your room for several weeks, you allow your baby time to adjust to the crib in an otherwise comfortable setting. Your baby may still have trouble adjusting to the crib if it is placed on the far side of your room. If this happens, you may need to compromise further by positioning the crib directly next to your bed. Once your baby becomes comfortable sleeping next to you in the crib, gradually move the crib further and further away within the room. When your baby is comfortable sleeping in the crib in your room, and has been so for roughly a week, it is time to move the crib back into baby's room. Sleep in your baby's room. If your baby has trouble sleeping in their crib once you move it into their room, spend a few nights sleeping on a cot or sleeping bag in the same room. Your presence can have a very soothing effect on your baby, which can turn an unfamiliar, uncomfortable set of surroundings into a safe place. By spending a few nights in your baby's room as they fall asleep, you can help to establish that room as a safe place. Once your baby has comfortably fallen asleep in your presence for three or four nights, you can ween yourself away. Coax your baby to sleep before leaving. Instead of spending the night in baby's room, only stay put while your baby falls asleep. If necessary, pat or massage your baby's back while cooing or humming softly to make your presence known. Begin by sitting nearby, making it easy for baby to see you. When your baby feels comfortable with the distance, move your chair back a little further. Each time your baby adjusts to the change in distance, move back a little more until, eventually, you are out of sight. When your baby is comfortable falling asleep without seeing you, you can start leaving the room and letting them fall asleep alone. Getting the Baby Used to Sleeping Alone Stop rocking your baby to sleep. If you coax your baby to sleep by rocking them, gradually stop the practice so that your baby learns to fall asleep without human contact. When weaning your baby from this practice, rock them until your child starts relaxing but is not quite asleep. Your baby might protest after you stop, but if your baby feels relaxed enough, these protests should not last long before they drift off. Gradually decrease the amount of time you spend rocking your baby until, eventually, your baby is able to fall asleep simply by being held and not by being rocked. After your baby adjusts to falling asleep without being rocked, you can transition them to falling asleep without being held. Use a bassinet. If your baby sleeps in your bed, graduate them to a separate bassinet or small cradle placed directly next to your bed. Your baby might feel more comfortable with the concept of not being able to cling to you at night if they can at least see you. After your baby has adjusted to sleeping separately and has done so for several weeks, you can consider moving your baby out of the room completely. Let your baby nap where they are comfortable. Instead of holding your baby during nap time, let your baby fall asleep wherever they can get comfortable. Oftentimes, babies have an easier time napping in baby swings or car seats than a crib. This is mostly due to the fact that these spaces are more enclosed, thereby mimicking the feeling of being held in mom's or dad's arms. While these spaces should not be used for naps indefinitely, they can be helpful in transitioning your baby from napping in your arms to  sleeping alone. Once your baby adjusts to sleeping alone in a confined space, you can start placing them in the open space of a crib during nap time. Introduce your baby to the crib during the day. Start your baby on napping in the crib before requiring your baby to sleep through the night there. Many babies have an easier time falling asleep alone during the day, when things are lighter and more active, than they do at night, once everything quiets down and they can no longer see or hear their parents. Give your baby time to adjust to sleeping alone at night. The transition into the crib may not happen quickly. You may need to stay in the room with your baby as they fall asleep for the first few weeks. Focusing on Comfort Calm your baby down before bedtime. Do what you can to relax your baby enough to make them drowsy. Wear your baby out during the day. Filling your baby's day with stimulating play and other activities will naturally make your baby feel more tired and worn out at night. As a result, your baby will be less likely to kick up a fuss about where they are sleeping. It might be especially helpful to plan an activity an hour before bedtime to burn off extra energy. Give your baby a warm bath before bed. Baths often have a soothing effect, and a warm bath can soothe your baby's muscles, making them feel physically relaxed. If your baby becomes more alert after taking a bath, however, you should avoid baths before bed. Try giving your baby a gentle massage. Gently rub your baby's back, arms, and legs to relax the muscles. If this seems to invigorate your child, though, skip this action. Minimize physical discomforts. Pain or other physical discomfort will keep your baby awake no matter where they sleep. Removing these sources of discomfort will make it easier for your baby to sleep anywhere. Give your baby a little food before bed. Roughly 2 or 3 oz (60 or 90 ml) of formula or breast milk can fill your baby's stomach enough to prevent them from getting hungry a few hours after falling asleep. For babies who are at least six months old, give them 1 or 2 Tbsp (15 or 30 ml) of cereal to accomplish the same task. Make it easier for your baby to breathe by introducing an air purifier or air filter into the room. Contaminants from fuzzy blankets or pets can get into the air, making it hard for your baby to breathe comfortably. An air purifier will remove most of these problems. The \"white noise\" from the purifier can also have a calming effect. Change your baby's diaper. Make sure that your baby has a clean diaper on immediately before going to bed. Use \"nighttime\" diapers to prevent waste from leaking out and soaking your baby's pajamas. Minimize teething pain. If you have your doctor's permission, you can give your child a small dose of acetaminophen to relieve the pain. Make sure your baby has comfortable pajamas. Babies with especially sensitive skin tend to do better in nightclothes made from 100 percent cotton than they do in clothes made from synthetic fabrics. Get the right setting. Creating a setting conducive to sleep will keep your baby mentally comfortable, as well. As a result, it will be easier for baby to feel comfortable enough to sleep in their crib. Dim the lights. Many young babies can sleep with a little light, but others associate light with being awake and active. Keep the lights off in your baby's room and limit your use of the hallway light while your baby is trying to fall asleep. If your baby is especially sensitive to light, use opaque shades to keep the sunlight out of your baby's room in the morning. Reduce noise. Most babies can sleep through a little noise, but it is generally a good idea to keep things quiet while your baby is drifting off. Otherwise, they may feel as though there is too much action going on to fall asleep. Do not let your television or radio share a wall with your baby's crib, and keep the volume as soft as possible when these devices are in use. Keep your voices low, and avoid having guests over while your baby is trying to fall asleep. Play soothing music. Try playing recorded lullabies, or place plush toys that play classical music or other soothing sounds in your baby's crib at night. Soft music has a rhythmic quality that proves very effective in helping many babies drift to sleep. Give your baby something with your scent on it, like a frequently-worn t-shirt. The scent will be familiar, making the crib feel more comfortable and familiar, as well. You may want to remove the item once your baby falls asleep, however, to prevent them from accidentally suffocating on it.",

        "Do not let your television or radio share a wall with your baby's crib, and keep the volume as soft as possible when these devices are in use.",
        "Keep your voices low, and avoid having guests over while your baby is trying to fall asleep.",
        "Play soothing music.",
        "Try playing recorded lullabies, or place plush toys that play classical music or other soothing sounds in your baby's crib at night.",
        "Soft music has a rhythmic quality that proves very effective in helping many babies drift to sleep.",
        "Give your baby something with your scent on it, like a frequently-worn t-shirt.",
        "The scent will be familiar, making the crib feel more comfortable and familiar, as well.",
        "You may want to remove the item once your baby falls asleep, however, to prevent them from accidentally suffocating on it."
