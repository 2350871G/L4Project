            "description": "Marking condiments on the wrap enables the front counter staff to accommodate special customer requests, e.g. a Whopper Burger with lots of bacon, or no tomatoes, or plain burger etc. It effectively allows customers to have the burger their way and enables the counter staff to recognize which burger (remember the burger is wrapped when you put it in the chute) contains what ingredients with regards to special requests. So to ensure the customers get what they want, and that the front counter staff pick up the correct burger, make sure you note any special request on the burger wrap. So, here is the key to marking condiments:\nH means heavy. L means light. O means only ingredient. + means PLUS that ingredient (e.g. if someone requests a Whopper Burger PLUS bacon, so you would mark + over the bacon icon on the wrap). - means minus that ingredient (e.g. if someone requests a Whopper Burger but NO mayonnaise, you would mark - over the mayo bottle icon on the wrap). ___________ line through condiment icons means PLAIN burger (i.e. nothing but the burger and bun)."
