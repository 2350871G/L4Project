Wait 30 to 40 minutes, then rinse it off with warm water. Almond oil absorbs easily into your skin. Because it is light, it won't clog your pores and lead to acne. If you can't get almond oil, however, you can use another type of oil. For a more hydrating mask, use 2 tablespoons of plain, whole fat yogurt instead of almond oil. Leave the mask on for 15 to 20 minutes. For a more moisturizing mask, switch out the almond oil for 1/2 of a ripe, mashed avocado. Leave it on for 15 to 20 minutes."
