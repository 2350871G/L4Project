You will also need 2 4 in (10 cm) by 4 in (10 cm) posts that are the same length as your shed and 2 4 in (10 cm) by 4 in (10 cm) posts that are the same width as your shed. Get a long, flat plank of wood that you will use to make sure the ground is level. Get hardened steel, structural, No.9, 2.5 in (6.4 cm) long screws."

Get a long, flat plank of wood that you will use to make sure the ground is level. Get hardened steel, structural, No.9, 2.5 in (6.4 cm) long screws. Calculate how much pea gravel and how many mason blocks you need. The amount of these items you'll have to get depends on the size of your shed. The larger your shed, the more pea gravel you'll need to fill the foundation hole. The same goes for the mason blocks. To find the amount of pea gravel you need, multiply the length of your shed by the height of the hole (3 in (7.6 cm)) by the width of your shed. You will need enough mason blocks to lay around all 4 walls of the shed, so find the perimeter of the shed, and divide it by the length of each block to determine how many you need. Pick a relatively level area for your shed. Putting a shed on a hill or another slanted area is a very difficult process that might require heavy machinery. You will find it much easier to level a relatively flat area. Avoid areas with standing water because this will cause a lot of problems for your shed. The water will soften the soil over time and the weight of your shed will cause the soil to shift even more. This could cause big structural problems for your shed. Mark out the area of your shed base using wooden stakes. Find the measurements for the base of your shed on the side of the packaging. If you're making a shed from scratch, decide the measurements you want for your shed. Use a measuring tape to mark out this area on the ground. Plant wooden stakes at all 4 corners of the shed base. For example, if your shed is 15 ft (4.6 m) by 7 ft (2.1 m), measure the front of the shed first. Place 2 stakes at either side of the 7 ft (2.1 m) measurement. Then measure 15 ft (4.6 m) from both of your stakes and mark both of those spots with 2 more stakes. Join the stakes together using string. The string makes it easier for you to find out if the measurements of the shed are square later in the process. Use string, fishing line, or twine. Tie the string around 1 stake before moving to the next stake. Tie the string to all 4 stakes, with all of them connected by the string. Make sure the string is tightly wrapped to the stakes and that there's no slack in the line. Tie the string at the same height on each stake. Check to make sure that the layout is perfectly square. You can do this by using measuring tape on the stakes and string. Measure from the bottom left corner to the top right corner and note the measurement. Then measure from the top left corner to the bottom right corner. If both of these measurements are the same, your layout is square. Use a shovel to dig a hole the size of the shed. Generally, around half the length of the head of your shovel should be the right depth to dig. If the ground is especially soft, dig the full length of your shovel's head in depth. Use the back of your shoe near the heel to force the shovel into the ground. Try to dig neatly inside the stakes. Remove the topsoil and grass with your shovel from the area. Topsoil is much softer than other types of soil and it could cause problems for your shed if you don't remove it. Topsoil is browner in color than other types of soil. Keep digging the topsoil out of the hole and placing it in a pile on 1 side until you start to notice a lighter colored, more solid soil below it. Stop removing the soil when you reach this lighter soil. Level out the subsoil using a plank and spirit level. Place a long plank into the area. At first, judge where the ground is uneven by looking at the plank. Move the subsoil until the plank looks close to level. Lay your spirit level on top of the plank and keep moving the soil until the spirit level shows that the ground is even. Repeat this process across the entire surface of the hole. Leveling the Soil and Pea Gravel Fill the hole to 3 in (7.6 cm) below the top with topsoil. Now that the subsoil is level, use your shovel to add the topsoil back into the hole. While the topsoil is softer than the subsoil and can cause problems, you won't need to worry once the subsoil is level. You will fill the remaining 3 in (7.6 cm) with pea gravel later.
