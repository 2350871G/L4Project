For easier clean up, mix a few drops of liquid dish soap into the paint. If you will be making these on paper, consider using a green ink pad instead. Dip the bottom of your fist into the paint. Curl your hand into a fist. Dip it into the paint, then lift it away. You want to cover the entire edge of your palm and pinky. Keep your first tightly curled for the next step. You can also apply the paint to your fist with a paintbrush. If you are using an ink pad, simply plunk your fist down onto it. Another option be to coat the bottom of a tiny shoe (ie: doll or baby) with paint. Press your fist straight down onto the desired surface, then lift it up. You can make the prints on just about any surface. Hard, easily-washable surfaces, such as floors, counters, and windows, work the best. Do not wiggle or twist your fist while stamping, however. Dip your pinkie finger into the paint. You can also use a paintbrush to apply the paint instead. You need just enough to cover the finger tip. Add five toes above the base print. Use your painted pinkie finger to stamp five small dots about the top, wide part of the print. You can make them resemble a real footprint even more by making them get smaller and smaller, towards the side edge of the foot. Be mindful about the placement.

If you want to make the paint even easier to clean up, stir in a few drops of liquid dish soap before you apply the paint to your painting surface. If you will be making these on paper, consider using a green ink pad instead. Find a small shoe to use. Doll shoes, Barbie shoes, and baby shoes would all work equally well.

        "Make sure that they are connected to the main part of the foot, however, otherwise they will come apart when you peel the parchment paper away.",
        "For a fancier touch, add a sprinkle of green, edible glitter on top of the foot prints while the chocolate/icing is still well.",
        "Make extra footprints in case some break when you peel them off of the parchment paper.",
        "Allow the footprints to dry.",

        "Arrange the footprints.",
        "Stagger the footprints so that they look like the leprechaun was walking.",

        "Here are some ideas to get you started:\nFront and/or back doors\nCupboards or drawers\nKitty or doggy doors\nWindows or vents Create a path.",
        "Leprechauns are curious and mischievous, so they wouldn't just run through a house without stopping.",
