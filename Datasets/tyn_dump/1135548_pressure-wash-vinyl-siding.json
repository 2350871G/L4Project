        "Work your way up and down first, then left to right.",
        "Keep the nozzle moving and let the water peel away the caked-on grime gradually.",
        "Avoid spraying in circles, swirls, or other indiscriminate patterns.",
        "Not only is this inefficient, it can also leave behind noticeable streaks due to the way it pushes the dirt around.",
        "Work in sections.",
        "After you've completed a 2\u20133 foot (0.61\u20130.91 m) wide strip of siding, move over and clean the next strip.",
        "Going over one part of the surface at a time is much quicker and more systematic than spraying aimlessly.",
        "It will also result in fewer missed spots, guaranteeing a more thorough cleaning.Look closely for any small patches dirt or grime that you may have overlooked before moving on to rinsing.",
        "Hold the nozzle straight or at a slight downward angle at all times.",
        "This will minimize the amount of water that finds its way behind the siding.",
        "Never spray in an upward direction, as this just pushes the water directly up into the spaces between the overlapping segments.You may have to stand on a ladder to hit the upper areas of the exterior without pointing the nozzle upwards.",
        "If too much water become trapped, it can cause bulging, mold buildup, and electrical issues, or even weaken your home\u2019s framework or foundation.",
        "Let the cleaning solution sit for several minutes.",
        "As they sit, the water and cleaner will work together to soften stubborn stains from the surface of the vinyl.",
        "The siding can then simply be rinsed clean with a stream of fresh water.Do not allow the solution to dry completely.",
        "It could leave behind unsightly streaks or scummy residue.",
        "Rewet the sections you\u2019ve gone over previously as needed to prevent them from drying while you work on the rest of the siding.",
        "Rinsing and Drying the Siding Empty out the cleaning solution.",
        "Before you begin rinsing, first get rid of all traces of detergent so that you\u2019re running clean water through the pressure washer.",
        "Hold down the trigger of the wand for a few seconds to make sure the line is clear.",
        "Switch to a lower pressure.",
        "To avoid putting anymore unnecessary stress on the vinyl, adjust the pressure setting to somewhere between 1,000 and 1,200.",
        "Since you've already removed all visible dirt and stains, you'll only need enough pressure to wash away the remaining cleaning solution.Alternatively, you can also use a garden hose for a gentler touch.",
        "Fitting the nozzle with a 40 or 60 degree spray tip will allow you to cover a much broader surface area at once.",
        "Rinse the siding from top to bottom.",
        "This time, you'll want to work in the opposite direction so the soap washes down the exterior.",
        "Otherwise, it's possible to leave streaks.",
        "As you did when cleaning, proceed one section at a time, rinsing until the water runs clear and no traces of soap remain.",
        "If necessary, take an occasional break to give the excess runoff time to drain.",
        "Allow the siding to air dry.",
        "Depending on the weather, this could take anywhere from a few hours to overnight.",
        "Get started early so there will be plenty of sunlight left by the time you finish.",
        "If desired, you can use a chamois to pat down narrow nooks and other parts of the exterior that don\u2019t get as much exposure.",
        "Plan your project for a day with warm, dry conditions to help speed up the drying time.",
        "Maintaining Vinyl Siding Clean your vinyl siding regularly.",
        "Aim to give your home\u2019s exterior some attention every other year.",
        "Generally, this type of project is best suited for summer\u2014warm, sunny weather will help slow the growth of new mold and make wet jobs more tolerable.",
        "When properly cared for, your vinyl siding has the potential to last for decades.If you live in a cool, moist climate or your home is situated in a shady location where it doesn\u2019t receive much direct sunlight, you may need to increase the frequency to once a year.",
        "Following an initial pressure washing, you'll most likely be able to get by with some old fashioned elbow grease until time and inclement weather make another deep cleaning necessary.",
        "Touch up the siding manually between cleanings.",
        "Scrub exposed surfaces periodically with a mild bleach solution to prevent day-to-day buildup from getting out of control.",
        "By staying on top of things, you may even be able to reduce the frequency of more intensive cleanings to every three or four years.For a little extra scrubbing power, opt for a Brillo pad or use a stiff-bristled scouring brush.",
        "One of these tools will be able to dig into the soft surface of the vinyl better than an ordinary cloth or sponge.",
        "Add touching up your exterior to your list of bi-monthly chores to complete around the house.",
        "Inspect for signs of damage and deterioration.",
        "Each cleaning should begin and end with a thorough visual assessment.",
        "Should you happen to discover potential problem areas, get in touch with the contractor who originally installed your siding.",
        "These will need to be dealt with sooner rather than later by patching or replacing the damaged section.Over time, exposure to the elements or the impact from falling tree branches and other debris can cause considerable wear and tear.",
        "If not addressed right away, damaged siding can become an eyesore or even fail, putting your home at risk for more serious issues like leaks, drafts, and water damage."
