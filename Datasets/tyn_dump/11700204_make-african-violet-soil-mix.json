If the pH is different, mix in lime or another treatment to fix it.To raise the pH, dilute some dolomite lime in warm water and use it to moisten the soil before planting. Lower the pH with diluted vinegar or ground sulfur mixed into warm water. Everything you need to monitor pH is available at gardening centers. Most homemade pH tests work by taking a sample of soil and mixing it with an included chemical, but there are also handheld monitors that detect pH when you stick them into soil."

        "Once it is moist, plant the soil in it right away.Watch for water to pour out of the drainage holes on the bottom.",
        "It shows that the water has passed all the way through the soil and you may even be using too much.",
        "If you wait, the soil may dry up.",
        "Wet it again.",
        "Make sure it stays moist so the violet adapts to the fresh mix.",
        "Apply a balanced 14-12-14 fertilizer to the soil, if needed.",
        "Select either a liquid or powdered fertilizer.",
        "Homemade soil mixes don\u2019t have fertilizer, so it\u2019s up to you to add nutrients for the violet to absorb.",
        "Once the soil has been moistened, sprinkle a small amount of fertilizer, usually about 1 tablespoon (15 mL), across the soil.The number on fertilizer symbolizes how much nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium is in it.",
        "A 14-12-14 fertilizer is 14% nitrogen, 12% phosphorus, and 14% potassium.",
        "Check the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations about how much fertilizer to use.",
        "Concentrated liquid fertilizers have to be diluted in water first.",
        "Commercial violet soil mixes often contain fertilizer, so be cautious about adding extra.",
        "Overfertilizing a violet causes it to overgrow and brown without sprouting flowers.",
        "Planting an African Violet in Fresh Soil Remove the African violet from its old pot to plant it.",
        "Grasp the plant at the base of the stem below the lowest set of leaves.",
        "Hold on gently to avoid causing any damage to the soft stem.",
        "Then, attempt to pull the plant out of its pot.",
        "If it feels stuck, stop and try to loosen the soil.Keep the soil at the right consistency so that removing the African violet is easier.",
        "If it is still stuck, try tapping the sides of the pot or sliding a knife around the edges of the soil.",
        "Be as gentle as you can when taking out an African violet.",
        "Never force it out, since that could cause permanent damage.",
        "Brush old dirt from the roots by hand.",
        "Look for the roots in the big clump of soil left at the bottom of the stem.",
        "You probably won\u2019t be able to see them at first, so start rubbing away the dirt a little bit at a time.",
        "Brush away as much dirt as you can until the roots are exposed.",
        "Then, reach in with your finger and gently brush away anything left on the roots.Take off as much of the old soil as you can.",
        "The plant will be fine if you\u2019re unable to tease out every last clump of dirt.",
        "As long as you remove most of it, the violet will be fine.",
        "Always clear away the old dirt before replanting.",
        "It may have leftover fertilizer and other things that could have a negative effect on your violet.",
        "Place the African violet and cover the stem up to its lowest leaves.",
        "Set the plant down inside the new pot.",
        "Then, fill in the hole you made.",
        "Cover the roots and most of the stem.",
        "Spread the soil out so the lower leaves barely touch it.Any buried leaves will end up rotting, so take care to keep them elevated above the soil.",
        "Leaving too much of the stem exposed could limit the violet\u2019s growth as well.",
        "Repot the African violet in new soil every 6 months to keep it healthy.",
        "The old soil runs out of nutrients over time, so mix a fresh batch.",
        "Remove the plant, then clean the old soil out of the pot.",
        "Water it lightly to moisten it, then add fertilizer if you wish.",
        "Replant the violet to let it begin spreading through its new soil.At a minimum, repot African violets once a year.",
        "With regular soil changes, violets last for decades.",
        "Unless the violet has outgrown its container, reuse the old pot.",
        "You can tell by how the violet fits inside the pot.",
        "If the plant looks crowded with leaves and roots spilling out from the pot, then switch to the next largest size pot available."
