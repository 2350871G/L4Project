If you're making other adjustments to the dress, such as making a shorter hemline, you might be able to use excess fabric from the dress itself. If you can't find fabric that matches the dress, choose a fabric that complements the style of your dress. For example, if you have a floral print dress, pick a fabric that's the same color as one of the flowers."

If you want a lot of coverage or will be wearing the dress to a very formal event, consider adding full-length or three-quarter sleeves.

For example, if you want to make a delicate cap sleeve, you probably want a thin strap that doesn't cover a lot of your shoulder. If you're making an off-the-shoulder sleeve, you'll want a very thin strap, such as a spaghetti strap. If you're attaching a full sleeve, it's alright to make the straps as wide as you like. Keep in mind that if your straps are over 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide, they'll completely alter the shape of the neckline."
