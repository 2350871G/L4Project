Before you start  brushing or bathing your dog, remove these items from your spaniel\u2019s coat. This is important as these can get tangled in the fur creating mats, or break into smaller bits while you brush or bathe the dog, making it more difficult to remove. Taking a few moments to remove foreign objects trapped in fur each day can save you a lot of effort and energy in the long run. Pay special attention to the area between the toes and behind the ears. Additionally, during grass seed season, check your dog after every walk and remove awns from their coat to prevent foreign body reactions."

For dogs with darkly colored nails, you will not be able to see the quick. Instead, trim away small sections of the nail checking between clips for a gray oval in the end of the nail. This is the bottom of the quick, and you should stop clipping at this point. If you do cut the nail to the quick, have styptic powder on hand. This powder is used frequently for shaving nicks and cuts and can be purchased in most pharmacies. Apply the powder directly to the bleeding toenail, and it will stop bleeding almost immediately.

        "Don\u2019t clean any further than the areas you can see, and never use cotton swabs to clean you\u2019re your dog\u2019s ears as you may cause unintentional injury.",
        "Clean your dog's teeth once a day.",
        "Use a toothbrush and toothpaste specifically made for pet use.",
        "Apply a small amount of toothpaste to the brush.",
        "Gently lift your dog\u2019s lips and brush each tooth on top and bottom.",
        "You may also want to offer your Sussex spaniel dogs chews made to stop tartar build up on teeth.",
        "If your dog has never had their teeth brushed, slowly introduce them to the brush and get a toothpaste flavored like his favorite food.",
        "When brushing your dog's teeth, make no sudden movements and be gentle or your spaniel may try to snap at you.",
        "If you don't want to clean your dog's teeth yourself, you can take them to a vet, who can clean them.",
        "Just know that there is no substitute for daily brushing.",

        "Using dog nail clippers or large, durable human nail clippers, remove just the very ends of your dog\u2019s nails, so they don\u2019t reach all the way to the ground.",

        "This is the darker pink part of the nail on dogs with white nails.",
        "For dogs with darkly colored nails, you will not be able to see the quick.",
        "Instead, trim away small sections of the nail checking between clips for a gray oval in the end of the nail.",
        "This is the bottom of the quick, and you should stop clipping at this point.",
        "If you do cut the nail to the quick, have styptic powder on hand.",
        "This powder is used frequently for shaving nicks and cuts and can be purchased in most pharmacies.",
        "Apply the powder directly to the bleeding toenail, and it will stop bleeding almost immediately.",
        "Styptic powder also helps to numb the area."
