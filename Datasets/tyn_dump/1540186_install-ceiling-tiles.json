If your ceiling is dirty or greasy, use a sponge to scrub one small section at a time using an all-purpose cleaner. It's important to let the ceiling dry thoroughly before applying your tiles. A clean surface will make your tiles stick more effectively. You may have trouble attaching them if the ceiling is dirty or has peeling paint. If your ceiling is very greasy, wash it using a mixture of 1 cup ammonia and half a gallon of water."

For example, if your tile is 24\" long and 24\" wide (2' by 2'), then the square footage for the tile is 4 (2 multiplied by 2). If the square footage for your room is 180, divide it by 4. You'll need at least 45 tiles. Always buy 15 percent more tiles than you think you'll need. That way, if you need to cut tiles or make a mistake, you'll have plenty to complete the job."

If your ceiling is very greasy, wash it using a mixture of 1 cup ammonia and half a gallon of water. Measure the square footage of the room. To do this, use measuring tape and record how long the ceiling is. Then measure how wide the ceiling is. Multiply these two numbers to get your square footage.

This will allow you to easily measure tiles and install them without damaging fixtures. You'll probably want to use a flat-head or Phillips screwdriver to remove fixtures. This is also a good time to give fixtures and vents a quick clean. Installing Tiles Directly on the Ceiling Use chalk lines to find the center of the room. Measure halfway across each wall in opposite directions, using the length and width measurements you made for the ceiling. Have someone hold the chalk line or reel while you walk to the opposite end of the room. Snap the chalk against the ceiling. Rotate 90 degrees and do the same for the two opposite walls.

Molding can make your room look more polished or finished. It can also hide edges of tiles that have been cut. Installing Ceiling Tiles with Furring Strips Locate one of the joists. A joist is a length of timber or metal that provides structural support. It's easiest to use a stud finder to locate them in the ceiling. Mark the spot with a nail or chalk mark. You might want to start by checking for joists near lighting fixtures since they're often installed along joists. Find the other joists. Measure 16 inches (40.64 cm) from the first joist and check for the presence of the next one. Joists are usually 16 inches to 24 inches (40.64 to 60.96 cm) apart, so you should find it close to those measurements. Mark a chalk line that shows the joists across the entire ceiling. Install the furring strips. Furring strips are thin 1\" by 3\" strips of wood that you attach at a right angle to your joists so that they are flush against the wall. You simply staple a nail into the strip. Use a level and make sure that the furring strip is level. If not, add a shim underneath to make it level. Make sure that your furring strips are at even intervals and that they fall through the center of your tiles. You may want to hold up tiles for reference as you install the furring strips. Apply the first tile in the corner. Snap a chalk line down the center of the first strip closest to the wall. Align the corner tile with the line and the wall, then staple it to the furring strip, using at least 2 staples along the sides and 1 in each corner. Continue placing edge tiles. Staple the tiles across the ceiling.Once you've stapled the edge tiles, work your way across the ceiling filling in with whole tiles. You may need to use a straight edge to cut a tile to fit around a fixture. When you reach a fixture hole, measure the size and shape of the hole and locate where it will be on the ceiling tile you're preparing to place. Use those measurements to draw and cut the hole.
