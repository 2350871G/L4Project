While you can use any long, bendable string, usually a steel or aluminum wire works best. Create a small loop at the end of the wire. Bend one end of the wire around your finger to create a small loop roughly 1 inch across. The end of the wire will bend back on itself so there are roughly 2\u20133 inches (5\u20138 cm) of extra wire at the bottom of the loop. This is your slip-knot loop.

Drill a small hole through a stake or wooden post. This will keep your trap in place once a rabbit runs through it. The hole should be roughly 8\u201310 inches (20\u201325 cm) off of the ground once you secure the post in the ground. Secure the wire to the stake. Feed 3-4 inches of wire through the hole in the post and then wrap it around so that it meets the rest of the wire.

You can also tie the wire to the post, or use a staple gun to secure it to the wood. You want to have roughly a foot of wire between the post and your snare.

Placing Your Traps Effectively Set up traps near fence holes. One of the best places to put a trap is in the holes rabbits use to enter your property. If your fence has openings that rabbits use regularly, fit the loop of your snare right in the hole and wait for them to come back. Place traps near small, beaten paths. Rabbit trails will show grass that has been stepped down repeatedly, little tracks in the dirt, and patches of mud. If you could walk through it, then rabbits will likely use it at some point to navigate the forest. Look for openings in tall grass, muddy paths, or known rabbit holes. Set multiple traps for the best results. Trapping is a numbers game; the more snares you set, the more rabbits you will get. Separate them by a few hundred yards to increase your chances of successful capturing. Make sure your snares are the right height. The snare works by catching the rabbit mid-hop so that it pulls the snare tight as it returns to the ground. You want your snare to be 6-8 inches off of the ground.

Constantly checking in on your trap scares away wildlife, so be patient. After one day has passed, return to the trap to check if it caught anything. If not, leave and return the next day.

        "As the rabbit jumps through the loop its weight will pull the loop tightly shut and kill the animal.",
        "Create barriers to force rabbits towards your trap.",
        "Using large branches, block off the space underneath and to the sides of your snare, forcing them to jump through your loop.",
        "You want to block off all the space except the one in your snare.",
        "Placing Your Traps Effectively Set up traps near fence holes.",
        "One of the best places to put a trap is in the holes rabbits use to enter your property.",
        "If your fence has openings that rabbits use regularly, fit the loop of your snare right in the hole and wait for them to come back.",
        "Place traps near small, beaten paths.",
        "Rabbit trails will show grass that has been stepped down repeatedly, little tracks in the dirt, and patches of mud.",
        "If you could walk through it, then rabbits will likely use it at some point to navigate the forest.",
        "Look for openings in tall grass, muddy paths, or known rabbit holes.",
        "Set multiple traps for the best results.",
        "Trapping is a numbers game; the more snares you set, the more rabbits you will get.",
        "Separate them by a few hundred yards to increase your chances of successful capturing.",
        "Make sure your snares are the right height.",
        "The snare works by catching the rabbit mid-hop so that it pulls the snare tight as it returns to the ground.",
        "You want your snare to be 6-8 inches off of the ground.",
        "Remember that a rabbit needs to fit its head and ears into the trap.",
        "Most rabbits are 6-7 inches big from nose to ear tips.",
        "Return to your traps after 24 hours.",
        "Constantly checking in on your trap scares away wildlife, so be patient.",
        "After one day has passed, return to the trap to check if it caught anything.",
        "If not, leave and return the next day.",
        "If you have still not caught anything, adjust the height of the snare or move it."
