Alternatively, you can add a simple pattern using rubber stamps and an ink pad or acrylic paint. For a fancier touch, draw your designs with glue, then sprinkle extra-fine glitter onto them before the glue dries. Be sure to let the paper dry before moving on."

    "text": " Making a Simple Gift Bag Choose a material to work with. You can make paper bags out of just about any type of paper you want, including: brown kraft paper, patterned scrapbooking paper, and wrapping paper. Cardstock is not recommended, however, because it is too stiff. If the paper is not the right size, cut it down. Make sure that it's a rectangle. For an extra-fancy gift bag, consider using fancy wrapping paper with either glittered or flocked designs. Decorate plain paper. If you are working with plain, solid-colored paper, such as brown kraft paper, it would be a good idea to decorate it. This will make it look more like a gift bag and less like a paper sack. Get out some paint and stencils, and add some pretty designs onto it. Alternatively, you can add a simple pattern using rubber stamps and an ink pad or acrylic paint. For a fancier touch, draw your designs with glue, then sprinkle extra-fine glitter onto them before the glue dries. Be sure to let the paper dry before moving on. Fold the top edge down to create a seam. Orient the paper landscape style, with the designed or decorated part facing up. Fold the top, long edge down by 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters). Run your fingernail along the crease to sharpen it. For a fancier touch, trim the edge with a pair of pinking shears first, before folding it. Flip the paper over so that the back is facing you. The folded part should now be flat against your work surface. Make sure that it is still along the top edge of the paper. If you are using plain paper, with neither a front or back, skip this step. The folded edge will be on the inside. Fold the narrow edges towards the center of the paper to make a tube. Overlap them by \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters). If you'd like, you can run your fingernail along the side edges to make creases. If you'd like a more \"oval\" shaped bag, however, don't crease the sides. Secure the edges with glue or tape. Unfold the top flap. Run a glue stick or lay down a strip of double-sided tape along the side edge of the bottom flap. Press the top flap back down. Run your finger along the seam to seal it. If you used a glue stick, make sure that you don't get any glue on the inside of the bag. Fold bottom edge up by a few inches. The more you fold it up by, the wider the base of your bag will be. Aim for about 3 to 5 inches (7.62 to 12.7 centimeters). Open up the pocket created by the fold and flatten it. When you folded the bottom part of the bag up, you will have created a pocket. Fold the top part of the pocket down and flatten it. Run your fingernail along the angled sides to create creases. You should have something that looks like a diamond, with the inside of the bag showing as a rectangle at the center. Fold the top and bottom center tabs towards the center. The \"diamond\" on the bottom of your bag has two tabs or flaps at the top and bottom. Fold them towards the center of the diamond; they will overlap slightly. Secure the bottom of the bag with tape or glue. Unfold the top flap. Run a glue stick along the bottom one or lay down a few strips of double-sided tape. Press the top flap back down and run your finger across the seams to seal them. Punch two holes for the handles on the front and back of the bag. The holes should be about \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) from the top edge. They should be closer to each other than the sides of the bag. If your paper is thin enough, you can punch the holes through both layers of paper at the same time. Consider inserting eyelets into the holes. This makes them sturdier as well as adds an element of design. Cut some ribbon for handles. Measure and cut two equal lengths of ribbon. For a more rustic touch, you can use strong, cording, yarn, or twine instead. Choose colors that go well with your bag. Avoid skinny ribbons. The knots won't be big enough to hold it inside the bag. Add the ribbon handles. Thread each end of your first ribbon through each hole on the front of your bag. Tie the ends of the ribbon into knots on the inside of your bag.

Secure the edges with double-sided tape or a glue stick. Wrap the bottom of the box like you would a present. Fold the side edges of the paper down first, right against the box. Run your fingernail along the angles on the top and bottom flaps to make creases. Fold the top and bottom flaps against the bottom of the box, and secure them with a glue stick or double-sided tape. Remove the box. If you'd like, you can pinch the corners of the bag first before you remove the box. At this point, you can put the box away.

        "Get out some paint and stencils, and add some pretty designs onto it.",
        "Alternatively, you can add a simple pattern using rubber stamps and an ink pad or acrylic paint.",

        "For a fancier touch, trim the edge with a pair of pinking shears first, before folding it.",
        "Flip the paper over so that the back is facing you.",
        "The folded part should now be flat against your work surface.",
        "Make sure that it is still along the top edge of the paper.",

        "You should have something that looks like a diamond, with the inside of the bag showing as a rectangle at the center.",
        "Fold the top and bottom center tabs towards the center.",
        "The \"diamond\" on the bottom of your bag has two tabs or flaps at the top and bottom.",

        "The holes should be about \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) from the top edge.",
        "They should be closer to each other than the sides of the bag.",
        "If your paper is thin enough, you can punch the holes through both layers of paper at the same time.",
        "Consider inserting eyelets into the holes.",
        "This makes them sturdier as well as adds an element of design.",
        "Cut some ribbon for handles.",
        "Measure and cut two equal lengths of ribbon.",
