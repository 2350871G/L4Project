Heat the pan over medium low heat until the cocoa and sugar dissolve, which should take approximately 3 to 4 minutes. You don\u2019t have to use dairy milk in the cocoa. Feel free to substitute almond milk, soy milk, or rice milk if you prefer. You can also substitute maple syrup, honey, or agave nectar for the sugar. However, you should start with 1 tablespoon (15 ml) and only add more if necessary after tasting."
