Mask before painting by working from the room's doorway around the outside, laying 1-foot-long (30.48 cm) strips of masking tape at the edge to protect carpet. Tuck the tape over the carpet edge and just under the baseboard trim as you work. Use the putty knife to press the tape down into the space under the baseboard.

Lay out the plastic and use the masking tape to secure it to the pre-existing tape to protect carpet edges. This will create a barrier of tape and plastic from the outside edge of the drop cloth to the wall. Measure and cut plastic to protect the middle of the room. Lay out and secure this plastic with more masking tape. Your carpet is now completely covered. Remove all outlet and switch plates with the screwdriver, taking care not to allow any part of the screwdriver to touch the inside of the outlet or light switch.
