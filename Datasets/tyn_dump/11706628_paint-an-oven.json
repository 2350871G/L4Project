Turn it to the Off position and leave it off until you\u2019re done painting. If the fuses were installed properly, then they\u2019ll be labeled to tell you which one controls each part of the home. If they aren\u2019t labeled, then it\u2019s safest to turn the master fuse in the middle off and cut power to the whole home. In houses, breaker boxes are commonly in the basement. Look where your water and gas valves are for the box. In apartments, the box is usually in a closet or somewhere else out of the way."
