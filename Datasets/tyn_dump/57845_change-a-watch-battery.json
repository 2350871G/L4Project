    "text": " Opening a Snap Back Watch Find the small indentation on the back of the watch. Turn the watch over and find the small hole or indentation that's on the side of the watch, between the watch back and the watch itself. This indentation is created specifically to help you pry off the back of the watch. If you can't find the indentation, scan the backside of your watch with a magnifying glass. Wear a pair of dust free latex gloves when replacing your battery. Slip a sharp tool into the indentation. Find a tool that's small enough to fit into the indentation you discovered. Tools like a small flathead screwdriver created for eyeglasses or a small blade may fit it into the indentation. Twist the tool to pop off the back casing. Use the blade or the screwdriver like a lever to pry up one side of the watch back. Once it comes loose, you can grab onto it with your hand to  carefully remove the back of the watch. Snap the back of the watch back into the casing. After you replace the battery, align the dials on the side of the watch with the indentations on the back of the watch. Press down heavily on the watch back until it snaps back into place. It's important to line up the back of the watch perfectly or you run the risk of damaging the watch's internal parts. Some watches require a watch press to reattach the back to the watch. Removing a Watch Back with Screws Unscrew the screws from the back. There should be small screws on the backside of your watch. These screws keep the back in place. To remove them, use a small screwdriver that you would use for eyeglasses and turn the screws until you can remove them from the watch. Make sure to put the small screws in a safe place, like a ziplock bag, so that you don't lose them. Remove the back plate. Once you remove all of the screws from the back of the watch, the back should easily lift up. This will expose the watch battery and other internal parts in the watch. Rescrew the screws into the back of the watch. Once you replace the battery, press the back of the watch back onto the watch and take the small screws that you removed earlier and screw them back into their holes. Removing the Back of a Swatch Watch Locate the indentations on the back of the watch. There should be slots on the back of the watch that are big enough to fit the edge of a coin. These are created intentionally for easy opening of the watch back. Insert a quarter into one of the slots. Place the edge of the quarter into the indentation on the back of the watch. If it doesn't fit, use a smaller coin like a penny or dime. Rotate the coin counter clockwise. As you rotate the coin, the small screw on the back of the watch should come up and the back should disengage from the watch. Remove the watch back. Use your hands to carefully lift up the backside of the watch. Make sure that you rotated the coin slots a full turn or the back won't come loose. Removing the Back of a Screw Off Watch Get a ball of thumb tack or glue tack. You'll need to get a ball of a sticky thumb tack or glue that will adhere to the back of the watch and help you rotate it. You can purchase this at most arts and crafts stores or online. There are also grip-balls that are made specifically to open the back of a screw off watch. Press the tack against the back of the watch. Knead the tack until it's soft and sticky. Press it hard against the back of the watch. Twist the tack counter clockwise and twist off the back. Once the tack is attached to the back, twisting it counterclockwise should loosen the back of the watch until it's not attached. Replacing the Battery Undo the strap and turn the watch over. It's easier to work with the watch if you're unobstructed. Undo the strap or remove the band completely and turn the watch over. Remove the back of the watch.
