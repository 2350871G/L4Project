If you are using a heart-shaped craft foam sticker, peel off the sticker backing, then stick it to your base. Secure it with glue, if needed.

You can also use heart-shaped craft foam stickers instead. To make a more professional stamp, use a sheet of stamp rubber. You can typically find it in the stamping section or printmaking section of an arts and crafts store. Cut the heart out. You can make a fancier stamp by cutting another heart out from the inside so that you have a thin outline of a heart instead.

This will create a rustic-looking stamp with lots of texture. You can also use this method on a much smaller scale on a pencil eraser. Make sure that the eraser is new and flat. You can also use this on a potato. Cut the potato in half first. Keep in mind that the potato will not last long. Trace around your heart with a craft knife.

Press the stamp against your desired paper, then carefully lift it away. If you need to, make any adjustments by carving back into the stamp. Using a Cardboard Tube Get an empty cardboard tube. You can use an empty toilet paper roll or an empty paper towel roll. Be sure to pull off any bits of paper. If you are using a paper towel roll, consider cutting it in half so that you can make two stamps. Flatten the tube. Set the tube down on a table. Squish it flat with your hands so that it gets a crease on both sides. Open the tube up slightly. You should have something that looks like a leaf or an eye. Tuck one of the creased edges into the tube. Use your fingers to press one of the creased edges into the tube. Your tube should now start looking a little more like a heart! Make sure that you fold the crease in from top to bottom. Wrap some tape around the middle of the tube. Gently push the top loops of your tube together until you get the heart shape you like.
