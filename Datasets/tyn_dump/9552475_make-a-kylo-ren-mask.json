The dome must have a similar circumference to your own head, otherwise it will look too clunky. The rim of the dome should sit above your ears. If you are using a plastic trashcan lid, secure the lid from the inside with black duct tape so that it doesn't flap around. Put the dome on and take your measurements for the neck guard. Measure around the dome's rim, from your left temple, around the back of your head, and to your right temple. Next, measure from the dome's rim down to your jaw. Cut a rectangle out of plastic based on your measurements. If you are using a plastic trashcan, cut this rectangle from the can part. You can also use a sheet of thin plastic or craft foam. Another option is to use poster board as well, but keep in mind that your helmet won't be very durable. Do not use the trashcan dome or plastic bowl for this. The dome is the top of the helmet. This rectangle is the neck guard. A craft blade or a good part of scissors should be enough to cut through most plastics. Make sure that the craft blade is brand new, otherwise it won't be sharp enough. Glue the neck guard to the inside of the dome's rim. Hot glue will work fine here, but if you want something more durable, use an industrial strength glue instead, such as E6000. Let the glue set before moving on. If you are using a domed trashcan lid, make sure that the U-shaped part of the flap is in the front. The opening between the 2 vertical edges of the neck guard needs to span the width of your forehead. Test the fit and trim it if needed before you glue. Trace the bottom of the neck guard onto cardboard to make the rim. Place your helmet down on a sheet of cardboard. Trace around the bottom edge of the neck guard to make a C-shape. Lift the helmet away, then trace 2 inches (5.1 cm) outside the C-shape. When you are done, you'll have a bold C-shape that is 2 inches (5.1 cm) thick. This will create a rim on the bottom part of the neck guard, and help create the correct angle for the taper. You can also use stiff plastic, craft foam, or poster board for this. Make the C-shape about 1 inch (2.5 cm) shorter on each side than the neck guard. Cut and glue the C-shape to base of the neck guard. Cut out your C-shape first, then place it against the base of the neck guard. Use hot glue or industrial strength glue to secure the inside curve of the C-shape to the outside edge of the neck guard. Let the glue set before moving on. The ends of the C-shape should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the vertical side edges of your neck guard. Trim the ends of the C-shape down, if needed. Trace the outline of Kylo's mouthpiece onto the edges of the neck guard. The shape starts at the top-right corner, where the vertical edge of the neck guard touches the dome's rim. It curves down towards the bottom edge of the neck guard, like a (, then angles sharply back like a /. Reverse the shape for the left side of the neck guard. If you are using black or dark-colored plastic, use a white chalk or marker so that you can see the lines clearly. Look at reference photos of Kylo Ren's helmet from the side.

The long, bottom edge of the skinny rectangle should be touching the outside edge of your cardboard C-shape. Glue these down first, then glue down the curved side edges of the skinny rectangle to the neck guard. Creating the Mouthpiece Base Create a template for the mouthpiece out of tracing paper. Wrap a piece of tracing paper over the front opening of your helmet. Trace the curved mouthpiece lines that you drew earlier on your neck guard onto the paper. Cut the paper along these curved lines. Make sure that the paper is the same height as the neck guard. Figure out the placement for your eyes and nose. Tape the paper template to the front of your helmet, making sure that the curved edges match up with the drawn lines on the neck guard. Put the helmet on, then feel where the bridge of your nose and eye sockets are through the paper. Mark these lightly with a pen or pencil. Copy Kylo Ren's eye holes onto the paper, then cut them out. Look up some reference pictures of Kylo Ren's mask from the front. Notice the shape of the mask's eyes: they are rectangular, but become narrower in the middle. Take the paper off first, then copy this shape as best as you can onto your template, using your eye and nose bridge markings as a guide. Cut the eye holes out with scissors or a craft blade. Trace the template onto black craft foam, then cut it out. Place your paper template onto a sheet of black craft foam. Trace half of the template, including the eye holes, onto the foam. Flip the template over, then trace the other half. Cut along the lines that you traced. Use a white pen to trace the template so that you can see it. You can use scissors for the base of the template, but you should use a craft blade for the eye holes. Glue the craft foam mouthpiece base to the helmet. Make sure that the curved side edges of the mouthpiece match up with the curved lines that you drew on the neck guard. An industrial strength glue will work the best for this step; the mouthpiece needs to be secure. Trace the silver details onto the template. Find more reference pictures of Kylo Ren's mask. Note the silver lines on his mask, then copy these onto the tracing paper template. Fill in the negative spaces between the silver lines with a pen or pencil so that you don't lose track of what to cut later on. Instead of doing the entire template, do just half of it. This way, you can flip the template over when tracing it to get a symmetrical piece. Cut and trace the template onto gray craft foam. Use a craft blade to cut out the negative spaces between the silver details that you drew. Place the template onto a sheet of gray craft foam, and trace it with a pen. Flip the template over and trace the other side. Cut the gray craft foam, then side it aside. Use a craft blade to cut the gray craft foam. Discard the negative spaces, and keep just the \"silver\" details. Crafting the Mouthpiece and Cover Trace the mouthpiece onto cardboard using the gray foam as a guide. Place the gray craft foam piece you just finished cutting onto a piece of cardboard. Make a mark in the middle of the eye opening, then sketch the bottom of the mouthpiece below the craft foam. Use reference pieces of Kylo Ren's mask as a guide. Set the gray piece aside, then finish your drawing. If you don't have anymore cardboard, use another sheet of craft foam instead. Kylo Ren's mouthpiece as has an upward arch cut into the bottom. Be sure to include this! Cut the mouthpiece out with a craft blade. If you want a symmetrical mouthpiece, cut out just 1 side first. Fold the mask in half, then use the cut side as a template for cutting the other side. Trace the mouthpiece onto thin plastic, and add the segments. Place the cardboard mouthpiece onto a sheet of thin plastic, such as a binder divider or milk jug. Trace around the cardboard, then set it aside. Look up reference pictures of Kylo Ren's mouthpiece, then copy the segments onto the top and side edges. You should have:\n4 narrow slits along the top edge. 4 squares on the left and right curved edges. Cut and glue the plastic to the cardboard to complete the mouthpiece. Cut the plastic out, including the segments, using a craft blade. Glue it to the cardboard. An industrial strength glue will work the best here. Hot glue sets up too quickly and will create too much bulk. Trace the mouthpiece onto a round serving bowl. Choose a round serving bowl that is the same height as the mouthpiece cover. Trace around the mouthpiece with a permanent marker, then set it aside. This will eventually make the outer cover for your mouthpiece. Choose something with an rough texture. You can also use a sheet of thin plastic instead, but it may not give you the right look. If you are using thin plastic, consider scuffing the surface with sandpaper. Use reference photos to refine the shape of the mouthpiece cover. Trace about 1 inch (2.5 cm) inside the left and right side edges. Leave the bottom curved edges the way they are, but trace about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) above the entire bottom edge. Use a differently colored marker for this step. It will help you distinguish which lines to cut later on. Draw the inner shapes on the mouthpiece cover using reference photos. If you look at Kylo Ren's mouthpiece, you'll notice 2 little, rectangular notches towards the bottom of the mouthpiece. You'll also notice a rectangle along the right side edge, about halfway down. There is a fourth rectangle just above the notch on the bottom left. There is a line connecting this fourth rectangle and bottom-left notch. Cut out and scuff the mouthpiece cover. Use a craft blade to cut out the mouthpiece cover, including the notches and rectangles. Remember to cut along your inner refined lines, not the outer ones. Use a craft blade or a nail to add some battle scratches to the mouthpiece cover. If the bowl is too thick to cut, switch to a dremel instead. It is a type of rotary cutting tool that works like a screw driver, except that it cuts instead of drills holes. Add some height to your mouthpiece cover. Trace the mouthpiece cover onto 2 to 3 sheets of cardboard. Cut them out and glue them together. Alternatively, you can glue squares of cardboard to the middle and sides of the mouthpiece cover. If you don't have cardboard, use craft foam instead. You may have to use 4 to 6 sheets instead, however. How much height you add is up to you. The goal is to add some depth and dimension to your mask. Painting and Assembling the Helmet Set up a painting station in a well-ventilated area. Find a place outside free from drafts, or a well-ventilated room. Cover your work surface with newspaper or a cheap, plastic tablecloth. Cover any exposed craft foam with glue to seal it. Craft foam is like a sponge: it is porous and absorbs paint. You will need to give it a smooth surface before you paint it. Get some decoupage glue (i.e. Mod Podge) or white school glue, and apply it to the craft foam pieces using a paintbrush. Let the glue dry, then add another coat. Let the glue dry completely before moving on. You may have to repeat the process a few times before you get a smooth coating on your craft foam. Paint the helmet and mouthpieces with black spray paint. Apply the spray paint from 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 cm) away using a sweeping, side-to-side motion. Wait for the paint to dry, then apply a second coat. Let the second coat dry too. Paint the gray craft foam pieces silver. You can do this with spray paint or enamel paint. Avoid using acrylic craft paint, as it won't be shiny enough. Let the paint dry, then add a second coat if needed. Be aware that enamel paint requires a curing time. This can take a few days, so check the label. Glue the mouthpiece cover to the mouthpiece base. You can use hot glue or industrial strength glue for this. Be sure to glue down the bottom and side edges. Leave the top edge, where the nose bridge is, alone. If you glue that down, you won't be able to add the silver piece. Slide the silver piece into place behind the mouthpiece cover. Peel back the nose bridge of the mouthpiece cover. Slide the silver piece into place, then glue down the edges. Start from the innermost silver detail and work your way outward. You can use either hot glue or industrial strength glue for this. Create the 2 connecting pieces between the helmet and mouthpiece. If you look closely at Kylo Ren's mask, you'll notice a piece on each side that connects the mouthpiece to the neck guard. Use reference pictures to sketch these pieces out onto thin plastic, cardboard, or craft foam. Paint them black, let them dry, then glue them to the inside edges of the neck guard and the mouthpiece. If you are using craft foam, remember to coat it with a few layers of glue first. These pieces are only a few inches/centimeters across, so look carefully for them! Glue a translucent, black material behind the eyes. Find sheer, black fabric, such as tulle or chiffon, and cut it into a rectangle big enough to cover the eye hole. Glue the material to the inside of the helmet, just behind the eye hole. You can also use translucent black plastic for this. Make sure that you can see through it.",
