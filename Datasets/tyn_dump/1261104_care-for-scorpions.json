You need to provide 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) of appropriate substrate for most scorpions. Substrate is important, as it will give your scorpion something to burrow into. For desert scorpions, use sand. For species that live in temperate or tropical environments, use soil or pieces of bark or mulch. If you have a burrowing species of scorpion (like desert hairy scorpions), you might want to add 6 inches (15 centimeters) of substrate. You can gather substrate on your property (if it is appropriate for the species of scorpion you have), or you can purchase it at a pet store. If you gather substrate from your own property, use caution as it could contain bugs or pesticides that may harm your scorpion."

This, though, could vary depending on the time of day and the type of scorpion you have. Desert species prefer a range of 72 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit (22 to 29 degrees Celsius). Tropical species prefer a range of 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 26 degrees Celsius). Temperatures should never go above 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius).
