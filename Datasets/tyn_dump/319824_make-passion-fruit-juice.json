The outer shell of the passion fruit protects the fruit when it falls from the fruit tree, but it also is notorious for retaining dirt and small bugs. To properly soak the fruit, fill your kitchen sink, a large bowl, or basin with cold water. For stubborn dirt particles, rinse the fruit under running cold water after it has soaked, and use your fingers to gently rub the shell clean. Make sure the passion fruit is completely dry before attempting to cut into the sell. Wet shells can be slippery."
