Loosen the mounting bolts on the outside of the brakes with a hex wrench. Take a hex wrench and carefully turn the 2 outer mounting bolts on the brakes counterclockwise to loosen them so you can adjust the brakes. Loosen the mounting bolts just enough so you can wiggle the internal mechanisms of the brakes but not so much that they\u2019re disassembled. You can find hex wrenches at bicycle repair shops, at your local hardware store, or by searching online. If you only need to adjust the brakes on 1 tire, do not loosen the mounting bolts of the other tire or you could cause the rotor and calipers to be misaligned. Squeeze the brake lever on the handlebars to center the calipers. The calipers are metal brackets that squeeze the brake pads against the rotor to slow down your bike.

Listen for clicking or scraping sounds as well. If you do see or hear signs of rubbing, adjust the centering bolts until the rotor rests evenly between the brake pads. Tighten the mounting bolts so they\u2019re fully secure and take a test ride. Use a hex wrench to fully tighten all of the mounting bolts so the brake assembly is held firmly and securely. Take the bike off of the rack and go for a short test ride in a safe area such as a parking lot or driveway to test out the brakes to make sure they\u2019re working. Always go for a safe test ride before taking the bike out for a longer ride. Checking for Rotor Rub Put the bike in an elevated stand so the tires can rotate. Place the bike in a stand that allows both of the tires to freely turn and so you can easily move around it to see the rotors and calipers. If you don\u2019t have a stand, flip the bike upside down and balance it on the handlebars and seat. Spin the wheels and check the gaps between the rotor and brake pads. Give the wheel a good turn so it continues spinning freely and locate the small rotor plate. Look in the space between the 2 brake pads on each tire for the rotor. Check both tires and find the rotor plate between each set of brakes. If your bike only has brakes on the rear tire, then you\u2019ll only need to check there.
