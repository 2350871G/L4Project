Alternatively, seal the pills inside a plastic bag and press it to powder with a rolling pin, a utensil handle, or a drinking glass. Strong-dose aspirin works best. You can fold the aspirin in a piece of paper instead of using a bag."

Rub this over the stain and let sit another five minutes. The paste should be wet enough that no dry powder is visible, but not so wet that it becomes runny."

            "description": "Wash in cold or warm water, as the acid in the aspirin may be less effective in hot water. Check to see if the stain has been removed. If it has, fold it and put it away. If not, consider repeating and then washing again. If you live in an area with \"hard,\" mineral-heavy water, this may inhibit the effects of your detergent. Consider adding washing soda to your laundry to counteract this."
