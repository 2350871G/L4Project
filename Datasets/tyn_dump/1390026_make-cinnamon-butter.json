    "text": " Making Cinnamon Butter from Scratch Pour the heavy whipping cream into a mixer, and beat it on high until it turns solid, about 15 minutes. The cream will be liquid at first, but it will start to thicken after 5 minutes. At 15 minutes, it will start to turn solid with some liquid at the bottom. Stop the mixer at this point. Pour the mixture into a colander. Let the liquid drain out, so that just the butter remains. You will be using this lump of homemade butter in your recipe. Squeeze the remaining liquid out of the butter. Roll the butter into a ball, squeeze it in your fist over a sink, and run it under cold water. This will remove any excess buttermilk and create a firmer texture. You will end up with about \u00bd cup (115 grams) of butter. Place the butter into a mixing bowl, and add the rest of the ingredients. If the butter is too hard, let it reach room temperature first. This will make mixing it easier later on. Beat the ingredients together until the butter is light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. From time to time, scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl so that everything mixes evenly. You do not want any lumps, clumps, streaks, or swirls. Transfer the butter into a sealable container. Try to use a glass container instead of a plastic one; it will preserve the flavor the best. At this point, the butter is ready to serve. If it is too soft, you can leave it in the fridge for a few minutes to firm up. Serve the butter at room temperature, or store it in the fridge for later enjoyment. It will last 5 to 6 months in the fridge. It is perfect on bagels, sweet breads, and toast. Finished.  Making Simple Cinnamon Butter Beat \u00bd cup (115 grams) of butter for 1 minute. You can use a hand-held mixer or a food processor fitted with a whisk attachment. You can also do it with a wooden spoon, but it will take longer. For a less sweet cinnamon butter, use 1 cup (225 grams) of butter instead.
