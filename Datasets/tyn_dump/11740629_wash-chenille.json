Avoid rubbing the chenille when you\u2019re cleaning up a spill so you don\u2019t accidentally spread the spill even more. Use a spot treatment that\u2019s labeled as safe on chenille. Visit your local big box store or home improvement store to find a cleaning product that works on delicate fabrics. To find out if it\u2019s appropriate for chenille, look at the list of recommended fabrics on the bottle. If it\u2019s on the list, you\u2019re good to go! Look for a spot treatment that works on stains without bleaching your materials. Saturate the stained area with the spot treatment according to the instructions. Dab or spray the spot treatment onto the chenille, applying enough to cover the entire stain thoroughly. Most spot treatments come in the form of a spray or pen, making it easy to apply the product directly onto the stain.

If the stain isn\u2019t completely gone, apply the spot treatment to the chenille again and let it sit before repeating the drying process. Washing Your Chenille Item by Hand Add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of mild detergent to a basin of water. Pick out a mild detergent that you use on clothing and delicates. Fill a basin or bucket with cool water and add the soap, mixing it gently with a spoon or your hand to create suds. Most loads of laundry only need about 1\u20132 tablespoons (15\u201330 ml) of laundry detergent. Submerge the chenille in water and move it around gently with your hand.

This is useful for items like sweaters, shirts, pants, or other chenille that needs to be shaped so it doesn\u2019t dry weirdly. Putting Chenille in the Washer and Dryer Place your chenille item in a pillowcase to protect it in the washing machine. Tie a loose knot at the top of the pillowcase to keep the chenille inside.
