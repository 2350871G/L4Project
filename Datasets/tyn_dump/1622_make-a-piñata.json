The easiest shape to make is an oblong sphere based on a balloon form, but you can make anything you want.

How long this will be will depend on many factors, including how thick the paper mache is, and the humidity and temperature of the air. In general, plan on several days. Decorating the Pinata Paint the pi\u00f1ata. Use a single color to smooth out the paper and to create an even surface. It does not need to be especially well-painted, just enough to cover the paper. Choose a color that matches the decorations you'll be adding on or to match the animal or character that you're turning your pi\u00f1ata into, as it'll probably show through. Glue crepe paper to the pinata. This will give your pinata a more traditional look. It is also a festive and inexpensive touch. Cut or tear strips of crepe paper and glue it onto the pinata.

Colorful cupcake liners and brightly colored tissue squares can be added as fringe. If you made an animal, add googly eyes for a fun look. Filling the Pi\u00f1ata Cut a hole for the candy. If the balloon has not yet popped, go ahead and pop it and remove it. Since you did not cover the knot of the balloon with your paper mache, you should have a small hole already. Make the hole bigger if needed. If the candy doesn't fit, cut away at the edge of the hole until it is large enough to pass the candy through. Punch two small holes around the main hole. Tie a string or ribbon to the holes to create a loop. This will come in handy later when it comes time to hang the pinata. Put the goodies in the pi\u00f1ata.

Cover the hole. Glue down some crepe paper on top of the hole, or use masking tape. The goal is to prevent the filling of the pinata from falling out before you've actually hit it. Hang the pinata. Tie another piece of string, ribbon, or rope to the loop you've already made and use this to attach the pinata to whatever you'd like to hang it from.",
