It\u2019s best to use your hand for this because it will allow you to feel the fat deposits in the body cavity, but a large spoon will work well too. Scrape down all sides of the cavity to make sure you don\u2019t miss any of the fat. Cut the pieces of fat into smaller chunks. Cut the chunks into 1-inch pieces or smaller. Keep the chunks equally sized so that they have a relatively equal melting time. Place the fat chunks in a medium saucepan or frying pan. Make sure to have a lid that will cover the pan. Fill the pan with water to a level that just covers the chunks of fat.  Cover the fat pan and place it over medium heat.  Cook the fat in the covered pan for 10 to 15 minutes over medium heat. This will steam the fat and allow the fatty liquid to be extracted out of the fat chunks. Uncover the pan and continue to cook at the same heat level until all the water cooks off.  Continue to cook the fat uncovered for 10 to 15 additional minutes after the water has boiled off. The fatty liquid will start to darken during this part of the process as it renders. Remove the pan from the heat once the fat chunks have liquefied and the fat has darkened.  Strain the fat through a strainer to remove any remnants or particles. A wire mesh strainer works best for this. The small holes in the mesh help to trap any chunks and solid bits of chicken meat. Pour the fat into a heat-proof storage container and cover securely. Rendered fat can be stored in the refrigerator for several weeks, or frozen for 3 to 4 months.",
