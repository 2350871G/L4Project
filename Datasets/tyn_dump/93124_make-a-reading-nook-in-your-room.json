Purchase a season-themed candle and place it in your nook to help you further unwind. To make the space even more tranquil and absorb noise, hang a tapestry on the wall. Creating a Canopy Nook Start crafting the canopy nook by taking apart the embroidery hoop. The perfect size for an embroidery hoop is about 23 inches (58 cm) and the hoops can be found at any local store that sells crafts. Take the hoop apart and place its hardware pieces in a baggie to keep them from getting lost while you put the canopy together. Slide the curtain fabric onto the embroidery hoop. You\u2019ll need 3 packages of white 110 in \u00d7 68 in (280 cm \u00d7 170 cm) curtains. Be sure that the casing seam at the top of your curtains are facing the hoop on its inside. Slide all 6 curtain panels around the circumference of the hoop. Secure the hoop back together. Clamp the 2 ends of the embroidery hoop together by inserting the hardware pieces you previously placed in the baggie. Slide curtains over the hoop\u2019s closure and make sure that the curtains are distributed evenly around the circumference of the hoop. Prepare the ribbons that will hang the canopy. Get a spool of off-white ribbon that\u2019s 1 \u20442 inches (3.8 cm) x 12 feet (3.7 m). Cut 3 pieces of ribbon about 4 inches (10 cm) long so that the hoop can hang a good distance away from the ceiling. If you want the canopy to hang down even lower from the ceiling, cut the ribbon pieces a little longer. Spread the curtains and loop the ribbons around the sides of the hoop. The ribbons should be looped onto the hoop every couple of panels so that the curtains are even on each side and the access points are more plainly seen. Tie the ribbons together at the top into a knot. Hang a hook from the ceiling, then hang the canopy from the hook. Hooks are available at most home improvement stores. Hang the knotted ribbon and your canopy curtains over the hook in the ceiling. Spread 2 of the panels to create a door. Add pillows to your finished canopy or stuffed animals to give the reading nook some personality. These reading nooks can also act as a tent around small armchairs in children rooms and nurseries and can be the perfect place to read to your child while they\u2019re in your lap. Creating a Closet Nook Make sure the closet is perfect to use to create your nook. If your room is too tight to accommodate a canopy nook, a closet nook is a great alternative. Your closet should have a great size, location, and should be optional for use. Prepare your closet for the nook. Empty the things out of the closet, take out your shelving, wash down your walls, and vacuum the floors.
