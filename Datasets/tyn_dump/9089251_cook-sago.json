Place the pot on your stove top and bring it to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium. Cook the sago over medium heat for 30 minutes. Pour 1 cup (237 ml) of sago into the boiling water. Cover the pot with a lid and set a timer for 30 minutes. Stir the pearls about once every 10 minutes. Add sugar to the water and sago. Pour in a half cup (118 ml) of granulated white sugar into the pot and stir the contents thoroughly. Now you're ready to lid the pot and reset the timer for 20 minutes. Stir the pearls every 10 minutes. If the water boils low, add more. The sago should be submerged in water at all times. Turn off the heat, cool, and enjoy. After your 20 minute timer rings, turn off the heat. Rotate the pot to a cool burner. While keeping the pot lidded, allow it to cool until it reaches room temperature. Transfer the sago to serving bowls and enjoy. Soaking Big Sago Add sago to a large pot of boiling water. Pour 2.1 qt (2 L) of water into a large pot and place it on a burner of your stove. Set the burner to high and boil the water. Add 6.8 fl oz (200 ml) more water to the pot along with 5.3 oz (150 g) of big sago pearls. Cook the sago on low heat, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Return the water to a boil after adding the sago, then reduce the heat to low. Keep the lid off the pot during this time and stir the sago occasionally with a slotted spoon.

Making a Mango-Sago Dessert Combine the cooked sago and pureed mango in a mixing bowl. Pour the cooked sago and pureed mango into your mixing bowl. Use a utensil, like a wooden spoon, to mix these ingredients until they are evenly distributed. Stir coconut cream into the sago and pureed mango.
