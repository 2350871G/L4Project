Locate the circuit breaker box in your home and turn off the power to the room or area your fan will be installed in. Some homes will have multiple breaker boxes, with one main and several sub-breaker boxes in different places. If you have multiple breaker boxes, turn off power at the sub-breaker box and the main box before beginning work."

Hold the fixture in place with one hand as you remove any screws securing it to the roof. Once they have been taken out, the old fixture should be able to detach from the ceiling. If there is no fitting where you want to install your new ceiling fan, you should call a licensed electrician to install one for you. You will need to run wiring through your walls, which is very difficult to do and can be very dangerous if done wrong. If you cannot hold the fixture in place while you remove the screws, get somebody else to help. This will reduce the chance of the fixture falling from the ceiling and make it easier to unscrew."

Do not cut any wires or attempt to rewire anything in your ceiling without help from a licensed electrician. If the wiring is different than you anticipated, stop immediately and call a professional to help. Always make sure something is supporting any fixtures you remove or install as you work on them.

You shouldn\u2019t use the existing ceiling box unless you are absolutely certain it is rated for a ceiling fan. If you're unsure, remove it and replace it with a new ceiling box that has a weight rating above the weight of your ceiling fan. Ask at your local hardware store or look online to find one that will be strong enough. If you're unsure whether or not your ceiling box will be able to hold your fan, look inside it for any markings or model numbers that will help identify it. Look online or ask at your local hardware store to make sure that the weight rating for your box is more than the weight of your fan. Some ceiling boxes will have cable clamps that secure the wiring in place. If you notice a metal fixture tightly holding the wiring, look for a screw on the fixture's side. Loosen this screw and slip the cable clamp over the end of the wiring to remove it."

Exposed wiring could lead to a dangerous short-circuit and further issues. If you see any exposed wiring, immediately secure it and cover it fully. Mounting the Fan Screw the canopy over the fan box. The canopy will lift up from the downrod and cover the wiring and socket used to hold the fan in place. Use the provided screws to secure the canopy to the fan box and keep the fan together. Attach the fan blades. One by one, lift the fan blades up to their mountings on the fan motor. Slot them into place according to the manufacturer\u2019s guide, and use the provided screws to tightly secure them to the motor. Make sure the screws are as tight as you can make them. Loose screws will cause the fan blades to wobble and potentially come loose as the fan is running. Install any light fixtures. Many fans will have space for a light fixture on the underside. These will usually be very simple to wire up and secure into place. Check your manufacturer\u2019s guide for instructions on how to install the lighting fixture into your specific fan. The wiring for the lighting fixture will generally follow similar rules as wiring the fan. Connect the wires of the same color together and secure with connectors and electrical tape to prevent short-circuiting. Turn the power back on and test your fan. Go back to the circuit breaker box or boxes and restore power the necessary sections of your home. Turn the fan on at the wall and watch it for a few minutes to make sure it is working as intended.",
