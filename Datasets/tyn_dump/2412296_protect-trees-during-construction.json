        "Keeping Trees Healthy During Construction Post signs to communicate that the tree is to be protected.",
        "This can help to warn construction crews, and it will reduce the likelihood of damage from machinery.",
        "The more professional the signs look, the more effective they\u2019ll be.",
        "Printed and laminated sheets of paper or heavy plastic signs will be most effective.",
        "The text can read \u201cDo Not Enter!\u201d or \u201cKeep Machinery Away from Trees!\u201d Water trees every 1\u20132 weeks during construction.",
        "Trees located within or near construction sites tend to dry out.",
