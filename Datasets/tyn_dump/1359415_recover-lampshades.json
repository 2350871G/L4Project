Remove the trim (if there is any) by pulling on it; it should come off easily. Using scissors, puncture the old fabric and gently cut sections away from the frame. Make sure you don't cut the liner fabric. You should also remove the old fabric if it's a darker color than the fabric you're using to recover the lampshade. If the original fabric is thick, keep in mind that light might have a hard time getting through 2 layers of fabric. If you're covering a plastic lampshade liner, you don't need to remove anything."

If the fabric is too heavy, the light from the lamp won't be able to shine through. When you're choosing your fabric, stick to thin fabric like cotton. You can also test the fabric by holding it up to a light and making sure enough comes through. Another thing to keep in mind is the pattern of your fabric. Drum and rectangular lampshades will look great in any fabric. Tapered lampshades look best in more randomized patterns."

Gently cut the material along the lines you traced from the template. Remove any remaining fabric from the work surface. Recovering the Shade Spray the underside of the fabric with adhesive. Lay the fabric out flat, face down. Apply a spray adhesive to the fabric, holding the can about 3 in (7.6 cm) away from the fabric. It is very important that you do this in a well-ventilated area, as spray adhesive can make you very ill if you breath in too much of it. Avoid spraying the adhesive on anything besides the fabric. Remember that spray adhesive is incredibly sticky (and permanent). If you accidentally spray it on anything else, you could have a mess on your hands! Cover the floor around your work area with newspaper and cover any furniture with a sheet or blanket. Position your lamp about 1 in (2.5 cm) from the edges of the fabric. Carefully set your shade down on the fabric, about 1 in (2.5 cm) from the edge, top, and bottom.
