Building the table involves a lot of cutting, drilling, and sawdust. Taking the proper safety precautions will protect your health in the long run. Also, wear earmuffs to protect your hearing while operating saws. Avoid wearing long clothing, jewelry, or gloves that can get caught by a saw blade.

Drill diagonally down at about a 45-degree angle towards the tabletop boards. Then, place a 4 in (10 cm) deck screw in each hole to secure the battens in place. To prevent the wood from cracking, always pre-drill holes before adding fasteners. Use galvanized screws on the table. They are much stronger than nails while also being resistant to water.
