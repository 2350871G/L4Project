You may also notice leaves drying up and falling off your plant. Examine your plants for webbing. Spider mites will leave webs under the leaves and stems on the plant. Look at your plants daily to see if there is webbing on any of your plants. Search for mites with a magnifying glass. Since spider mites are less than 1 mm in size, they can be hard to see with the naked eye. Purchase a magnifying glass from a department store or online and examine the leaves on your plants. If you see small specks moving on the leaves, there's a good chance you have spider mites. Shake your plant's leaves over a white piece of paper. If you don't have a magnifying glass, you can use a white sheet of paper to see the mites. Hold a piece of paper under the leaves of your plant and then shake them.

If you notice that you have spider mites and want to minimize their damage to your plants, it's best to separate the mite-infested plants. Move them to a different part of your garden or indoors before you try to remove them. Spray down your plants with a hose. Water from a hose is strong enough to kill spider mites.

Water from a hose is not strong enough to destroy spider mite eggs, so spraying the plants down once a week for a month will ensure that you kill the new mites that are hatching. Using Horticultural Oil Dilute horticultural oil with warm water in a spray bottle. Horticultural oils are oil-based products that smother insects and their eggs. You can purchase horticultural oil at a home and gardening store or online. Before diluting the horticultural oil, make sure to read the instructions that came with it so that you know how much water you should use and whether it's safe to use on your plants.

Horticultural oil may be affected by rain or high humidity and moving them inside will help prevent this.

Thoroughly spray the plants with the oil. Since water and oil separate, it's important that you shake the bottle regularly as you use it. Saturate the top and bottom of the leaves with the oil. Allow the oil to soak in and kill the mites and their eggs. Horticultural oil works by suffocating the mites, so it's important you get complete coverage. Do not use the oils on flowers because it could damage them. Spray every 2-3 weeks until the mites are dead. Check for spider mites periodically throughout the rest of the week.
