If you notice shaking, your toilet may need minor or serious leveling. Start with small adjustments and, if the toilet still feels uneven, move on to more extensive adjustments later. If you are trying to make the toilet completely level, use a carpenter's level to measure how close the floor is to even. Purchase stainless steel washers or plastic shims from a hardware store. Plastic shims are made specifically for leveling toilets, but stainless steel washers can work just as well. Remove the bolt caps and loosen the hex nuts. There are 2-4 bolt caps on both sides of the toilet bottom to secure it to the floor. Take off the bolt caps to reveal the hex nuts, and loosen them with a wrench. In some cases, the toilet may be wobbly because these nuts are loose. If that\u2019s the case, simply tighten them! Add stainless steel washers or shims to the bottom of your toilet.
