Answering a casual, light-hearted question with \"Yes, haha\" or \"Yeah\" rather than just \"Yes\" will show your text-ee that you are in a good mood. The same goes for smilies. But don't go overboard; one smiley per text is plenty."

The best thing to do is to simply stop responding. They will understand. This also works when a friend says something you appreciate, but have no response for. Just let the conversation go."
