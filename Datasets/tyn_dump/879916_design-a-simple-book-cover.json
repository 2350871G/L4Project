Choose and print the artwork first, later adjust the size of the lettering of the title, so that it will be in harmony with the picture. Black is always a good choice for the color of the lettering. Make a simpler artwork such as an anchor instead of the ship. Technically make the lettering precise. Artistically, make your cover pleasing to look at. Use a multi-colored scheme for the title. Instead of artwork, use a photo or a picture from the internet, of the actual book cover. In this photo, the title was not cut perfectly and by framing it the uneven cutting would not be visible. Frame the title also with a marker pen and a straight edge."
