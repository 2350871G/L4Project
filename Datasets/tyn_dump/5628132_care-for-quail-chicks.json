        "It's important to raise them in a brooder for the first four to six weeks of their lives to ensure that they are safe, warm and are being kept healthy.",
        "This also goes for a hen with her chicks.",
        "It is especially important if the hen and her chicks are housed with other quail or aviary birds (finches, budgies, etc.)",
        "as they will attack or peck at the chicks.",
        "Free feed your chicks a special gamebird chick starter diet.",
        "Chick starter provides more protein than a quail's average feed and should be given to your chicks for six to eight weeks to keep them healthy.",
        "They should be free fed, meaning there should always be food available for them, so fill their feeding bowl as often as is necessary.",
        "Find special chick starter feed at your local pet store or online.",
        "Don't substitute starter diet meant for chickens.",
        "It doesn't have enough protein for growing quail chicks.",
        "If you cannot purchase chick starter, use your normal quail feed and grind it down so that it is edible for the chicks.",
        "For the first week, you may want to place paper towels over their bedding and sprinkle crushed starter diet all over them to help the chicks find and eat the feed.",
        "Add a small amount of normal quail food as the chicks grow older.",
        "You can start mixing in normal quail food by the age of 3-4 weeks.",
        "Start by mixing in just a little bit, then gradually increase the amount of adult quail food and decrease the amount of chick starter.",
        "When they are older than 8 weeks, consider experimenting with different mixtures of food and begin to feed them adult quail food.",
        "Provide plenty of fresh, lukewarm water for your chicks.",
        "Fill the water bowl as often as needed to ensure they always have access to clean water.",
        "Clean the water bowl at least once per week.",
        "It can help to individually dip each of the quail's beaks into the water dish as soon as you transfer them to the brooder.",
        "This will keep them from getting dehydrated right after they hatch, and it will show them where the water in the brooder is.",
        "If the water is too cold, the chicks could become chilled and die.",
        "If your chicks have a more messy bedding such as wood shavings or sand, clean the bowl every few days, or even every day if you see there is a lot of dirt and bedding in the bowl.",
        "Clean the brooder daily.",
        "Replace any wet bedding at the bottom of the brooder every day.",
        "Wipe down the walls of the brooder with a paper towel dampened with soap and water.",
        "Take out and replace all the bedding every couple of days.",
        "Depending on the amount of chicks you have and how old they are, it's important to clean the brooder often as the waste can make your chicks sick.",
        "Hold the quail every day to tame them.",
        "Hand-raised baby quail can become quite tame.",
        "Spend some time with the chicks every day, holding them gently in your hand.",
        "Pick up each quail and let them explore your hand for a few minutes.",
        "Sometimes they might want to burrow under your thumb for warmth.",
        "Use one finger to gently stroke them.",
        "When baby quail are hand raised, they become less skittish as adults.",
        "You may find that quail you raised and interacted with often as chicks will readily let you pick them up and even scratch them under the chin as adults!",
        "Give the chicks toys to keep them occupied.",
        "Quail chicks are curious and have a lot of energy.",
        "A totally empty brooder might get a little boring.",
        "Even after just a few days, try adding some cut branches to give them something to climb on.",
        "You can also put parrot toys or small mirrors inside the brooder.",
        "Just be sure there are no parts small enough for them to swallow.",
        "Adapting to the Chicks as They Grow Let your chicks explore outside after a couple of weeks.",
        "Put the chicks (and the hen, if she is living with them) in an outdoor cage and then watch them dig for bugs, dust bathe in dirt/sand and explore the new environment.",
        "Be cautious and make sure they cannot get out.",
        "To be sure, watch them for a minute or two to see how they adapt to their surroundings.",
        "If you're not watching them, put a tarpaulin on top of the cage so no birds will attack/scare them.",
        "Make sure to weight down the blanket with something heavy (like bricks) so the wind won't blow it away.",
        "Provide a tub of sand for your chicks.",
        "After they are a couple weeks old, place a small, shallow tub in their enclosure.",
        "Fill the tub with sand.",
        "They will soon begin dust bathing, a ritual quail really love.",
        "Dust bathing also prevents mites, lice and other nasty parasites.",
        "Give your chicks more space when they are 3 weeks old.",
        "Quail chicks grow fast, so you will soon see that they will need more space.",
        "Keep your chicks isolated, but move them to a bigger brooder when they reach 3 weeks of age.",
        "The chicks will need twice as much space at 3 weeks: about 1 sq ft (930 cm) per chick.",
        "Introduce them to your other adult birds when the are 5 weeks old.",
        "Once the chicks have most of their feathers, they are ready to be put outside with other adult birds.",
        "If these will be your first outdoor birds, build them a quail habitat in your yard."
