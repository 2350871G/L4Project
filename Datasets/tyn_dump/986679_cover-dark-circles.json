Then use your finger or a makeup brush to lightly tap the concealer until it's blended into your skin. Do not rub the concealer, as this makes the coverage uneven. If you can still see the dark circles, you could try doing a color correction concealer before applying your foundation and regular concealer. If you have fair skin, apply a peach or apricot concealer to counteract the blue tones prevalent in most under eye circles. For medium skin, try an orange concealer. Darker skin tones can use darker oranges or red. Consider using a stick concealer. They use a thicker, creamier formula that covers dark areas more effectively. Keep in mind that a stick concealer may trigger an acne breakout on oily skin. If this is a concern, use a liquid concealer.
