                    "description": "If your trash can is full or the vanity is littered with crumpled tissues, your bathroom is definitely going to look messy. Getting rid of the garbage can instantly make the space appear cleaner. Start by emptying the trash can into a plastic garbage bag, and toss in any other trash that might be in the room. It's a good idea to leave the garbage bag hanging on the bathroom door so you can add any additional trash that you might come across. To make it easier to get rid of garbage in your bathroom, consider lining the trash can with a plastic bag so you can easily empty it when it's full. You may want to invest in a covered or closed trash can for the bathroom. That way, even if there's garbage in it, guests won't see it so the room will appear tidier. When you're gathering up trash, make sure to put away any items that might be lying on the vanity or countertops, such as toothpaste, makeup items, or razors."

                    "description": "The areas of the bathroom that are the dirtiest will likely require some extra time to get clean. Choose your favorite bathroom cleaner(s) and apply it to areas such as the shower, toilet, and sink and allow it sit until the end of your cleaning. That will give the cleaning products time to really penetrate and break down the dirt and grime. Make sure to follow the cleansers' instructions carefully. When it come to cleaning the shower, tub, and sink, it's best to choose a cleanser that will remove mildew and soap scum. To get make sure your toilet is as fresh and clean as possible, you'll probably want to use a targeted toilet cleaner. The longer that you allow the cleaner to sit, the better -- but make sure to wait at least five minutes. Don't forget the door or liner when you're applying the cleaner to your shower. Bathroom cleaners usually contain strong chemicals, so check that the space is properly ventilated to avoid any effects from the fumes."

Use a glass cleaner on any mirrors and windows, and wipe down the countertops and other surfaces with a rag dampened with warm soapy water. Be sure to rinse thoroughly to remove any soap film. Use a lint-free rag to wipe down the mirrors and windows, so you don't wind up with fibers on your surfaces. If your bathroom countertops are tile, it's best to avoid cleaning with soap or detergent because they may cause a film. Instead, create a solution of equal parts water and white vinegar, and use that to wipe down the tiled surfaces."
