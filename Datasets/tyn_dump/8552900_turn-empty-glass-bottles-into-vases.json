Sometimes, it does not take a lot of work to make an effective design. Get an interesting bottle, remove the label, and clean off any residue. Wipe it down with rubbing alcohol, then try one of the methods listed below! Use spray paint to create an ombre design. Turn the bottle upside down, and spray paint the bottom. The excess paint will fade down the sides for an ombre effect! Try an embossed design. Draw on the bottle using hot glue, then give the bottle a few light coats of spray paint. Use acrylic paint in a darker color to add shading between the designs, if desired. Embellish the bottle with rhinestones. Get a stripe of rhinestones, and wrap it around the base and top of the bottle. If you'd like to, you can paint the bottle first using spray paint. If the rhinestones are not self-adhesive, you will need to glue them on. Wrap some colorful paper around the middle of the bottle. Cut down some wrapping paper to 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters). Wrap it around the bottle with a \u00bd-inch (1-centimeter) overlap. Secure both ends of the paper with glue dots or double-sided tape. You can also use scrapbooking paper instead. Add a thinner strip of wrapping paper on top of the first one for more contrast. Give it a rustic touch with twine or burlap. Wrap the bottom portion of the bottle with burlap or twine. Secure both ends of the burlap or twine with hot glue. Embellish the bottle further with a chalkboard label, thin lace trim, or ribbon. Give reverse stencils a try. Choose a reverse stencil where it's just the solid shape; you can also make your own by cutting a simple shape out of contact paper. Place the stencil onto the bottle, then paint the entire bottle with spray paint. Let the paint dry, then remove the stencil.",
