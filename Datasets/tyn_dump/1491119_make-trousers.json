        "Sewing the Trousers Together Attach the pockets before pinning the pantlegs together.",
        "Sewing pockets requires cutting out multiple pieces for each pocket and pinning them onto the edges of the pantlegs, then sewing, pressing, and topstitching the edges of the pockets.",
        "It\u2019s not difficult to do, but it requires several additional steps and you\u2019ll likely need to do this before sewing up the pantlegs and waistband of the trousers.",
        "Consult your pattern for details on how to add pockets to your pants.",
        "Sew along the outer edge of each pantleg.",
        "Place the pinned edge of the pantleg under the presser foot of your sewing machine and sew a straight stitch down the edge.",
        "Keep the needle about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the raw edge of the fabric.",
        "This will provide plenty of security for the seam.",
        "Remove the pins as you sew.",
        "Do not sew across the pins as this may damage your sewing machine.",
        "Make sure to use a thread that matches or complements your fabric.",
        "For example, if you\u2019re making black trousers, you may choose to use black thread, or opt for yellow thread if you want it the thread to stand out.Tip: Check your pattern for any special instructions about pressing seams and topstitching.",
        "You may need to unfold the pantlegs and topstitch them before proceeding to the next leg.",
        "Sew a straight stitch along the inseam of the pantleg.",
        "Repeat the straight stitch on the inseam of the trousers just as you did for the outside of the pantleg.",

        "Remove the pins as you sew.",
        "Don\u2019t sew over them.",
        "Insert 1 pantleg into the other and sew along the crotch.",
        "Turn 1 of the pantlegs right-side out and leave the other inside out.",
        "Insert the right-side out pantleg into the inside out pantleg so that the bottom edges of the pants are even and line up the crotch seams.",
        "Then, sew a straight stitch from the back of the pants across the crotch areas and around to the front.",
        "Position the stitch 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the raw edges of the fabric.",
        "If the fabric is slippery, you may want to insert pins through the edges of the fabric before you sew.",
        "If you\u2019re adding a zipper to the front of the pants, leave the required amount of space for the zipper open on the front of the pants.",
        "If you\u2019re using elastic to secure the pants, sew all the way up to the top edge of the waistband in the front of the pants.",
        "Install a zipper or elastic waistband to secure the pants.",
        "You can secure trousers with a zipper or an elastic waistband depending on what you prefer.",

        "Consult your pattern for details on what type of closure to use for the pants.",
        "For an extra sleek pair of trousers, try adding an invisible zipper.",
        "Trim and hem the pantlegs to the desired length.",
        "If you\u2019re making the trousers for yourself, try them on and check the length.",
        "Have a friend help you with this part since you\u2019ll need someone to pin the pants up to the desired length while you\u2019re standing up straight.",
        "Or, if you\u2019re making the pants for someone else, have them try them on and pin them up to the length they want.",
        "Then, remove the pants, trim the excess fabric, if needed, and sew across the folded edges of the pants to secure the hems.",
        "Position the stitch about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the folded edges of the pantlegs.",
        "Make sure that the raw edges of the pantlegs are tucked up inside of the pantlegs and not visible.",
        "After you finish hemming the pantlegs, trim any remaining excess threads."
