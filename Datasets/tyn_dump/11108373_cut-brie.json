                    "description": "To cut the cheese without it sticking to the knife, you'll need a long knife with a very thin blade. If you don't have a brie knife, use any knife that has a thin, sharp blade, or even a blade with holes. These are sometimes called open blade knives. If you plan on spreading the brie on a baguette, you may also want to get out a small, pointed cheese knife that you can set next to the cheese. This knife is sometimes called a small spade."

It will be harder to taste the unique flavors of the brie if it's served cold from the refrigerator.

Wrap the brie in plastic wrap and put it in an airtight container. Then, refrigerate it for up to 2 to 3 days. Slicing a Wedge of Brie Choose a sharp brie knife. Look for a thin knife with a long, narrow blade that won't stick to the cheese. If you can, choose one that has holes in the blade to make it easier to slice the brie. You can also set a small spade or spreading knife on the cheese platter if you'd like to spread the brie on a baguette. Slice along the length of the room-temperature wedge.

The point of the wedge is called the nose, which is why you might have heard people say, \"Don't cut the nose off of the cheese!\" Removing the Rind Put the brie in the freezer for 20 to 30 minutes. Keep the brie in its packaging so it doesn't absorb odor while it's in the freezer. Chilling the brie briefly will make it easier to slice off the rind. You can freeze the brie up to 1 day.

Then, unwrap the brie from its packaging and put the cheese on a cutting board. While you want it to drop to room temperature for serving, you should cut the rind off while the cheese is still cold. Turn the brie on its side and cut off the flat sides. If you're cutting a wedge, turn it onto one of its flat sides. If you're cutting a disc of brie, you'll have to move it onto the rounded edge and hold it in place. Then, take a sharp knife and carefully slice away the flat sides of the wedge or disc.Tip: Ensure that you're only trimming off the rind and not cutting into the cheese itself. You can use any type of knife for this step. Trim off the rounded sides or sides of the wedge. Lay the disc or wedge of brie back down onto the cutting board and carefully cut off the rounded edge around the sides of the disc.
