While brass, woodwind, string and percussion players also definitely need to keep hydrated, singing with dry chords could cause injury. Sunscreen to prevent burning, as well as guard against melanoma. Sunglasses to stop the sun from blocking your eyes, if allowed. A hat can also suffice if you don't have or aren't allowed a pair of sunglasses. A change of clothes: just something simple like exercise shorts and a t-shirt. You never know if you might slip in the mud, get sweaty, or simply start feeling uncomfortable. Deodorant to put on mid-day (at a meal?) if you have longer rehearsals."

                    "description": "You'll perform better and feel better if you take care of your body. While marching band is technically considered an art, it is more rigorous than many sports. Stretch. Marching band can be demanding during the summer. You don\u2019t want to pull a muscle or injure yourself. Also, take it easy when you have off time- Even though it's summer, staying outside and running around is sure to wear you out, leaving you with little energy or focus when it's time to get back to work. Wear sunscreen and a hat if you will be marching in the sun. That sunburn won't feel good tomorrow, and it'll spare you sock tans, glove tans, and drum harness tans (somewhat). Remember to reapply every 2 hours or so. Wear chapstick that protects against the sun. Sunburned lips are not fun to play an instrument with, especially for brass players. Also be sure to wear shoes that don't come off in the mud if you know your school's fields are muddy during the summer. Drink plenty of water. This means water or Gatorade/Powerade (see Warnings). Soda and juice will dehydrate you and can damage woodwind instruments if you drink them shortly before playing. Be sure to drink a full glass of water 20-30 min before you go out into the heat. Avoid drinking milk or eating dairy products just before camp. The heat will not cause it to curdle, your stomach will stay at a constant temperature unless you get heat stroke and the acid in your stomach always curdles milk anyway. Dairy will take a while to fully digest and you could become nauseous. Get an insulated jug for water. Don't forget to clean and dry it after each day's practice, so it doesn't gunk up inside. Eat healthy foods! Eating food that wouldn't benefit your body in the first place will be even worse after such a strenuous activity such as marching. People seem to discredit how tiring it is- Heavy clothing and walking around in the sun all day is hard enough, but doing that with any instrument- from a lightweight piccolo to a fifty-pound bass drum- will surely exhaust you. Eat what you would before a workout, and plan to drink throughout the day. Wear movable clothing and comfortable, athletic shoes. Dress appropriately for the weather and don't forget a jacket and gloves if it will get cold."

If you ever have to get pads replaced on your marching instrument, ask for plastic pads. Oil your valves or slide before practice. It's much harder from mid-field. For percussion, take the opportunity to learn from your drum instructor how to tie cymbals properly and how to replace and tune a drumhead. If you don't already know those instruments as well as you know the instruments you spend the most time at, be it at a lesson or in the school auditorium, you need to take the initiative to ask someone how they work in full detail. Trust the words of every percussionist ever- not only will it keep the instruments in good condition for this session of camp, but it will also further your musical education and may come in handy in other performances, auditions and ensembles. Learn the proper way to set your instrument down: not on its keys or delicate valves. If you must set your instrument on the ground, set it with the others from your section in a formation. It's a nice flourish and shows off sectional spirit, and it might help save them from a careless foot. However, remember that your protective case or a stand made for the instrument is the most secure place to keep it. Consider marching a second-string instrument, particularly during rehearsals.

It's not your place to judge the other sections, and it's a great way to make enemies, which is something you don't want to do. If there is a correction to be made, the BD will make it. As a camp community, remember, you have to work as a team. If something goes wrong in one section and you talk badly of it, not only does it reflect badly on you, but will also reflect badly on the community as a whole. If you work together as a team with a positive mindset, you're sure to thrive together- and you'll learn something great along the way! Get some rest. Band camp can be strenuous, and it's easier if you're well rested.",
