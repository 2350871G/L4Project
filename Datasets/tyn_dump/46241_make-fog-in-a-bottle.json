Just try to run tap water as hot as it goes. Fill the bottle to a little below the brim and set the bottle aside for 60 seconds. Fog is formed when warm water vapor comes into contact with cold temperatures. By heating up the inside of the bottle with hot water, you are creating warm vapor inside the bottle."

                    "description": "While you're letting the bottle sit, prepare your ice. Take some ice cubes from the fridge and place them in a plastic bag or a strainer. Whether you use a bag or strainer depends on the container you're using for your project. Some people use jars instead of bottles for this experiment. If you're using a jar, it's a good idea to set the ice in a strainer, which you should be able to find at a grocery store. The strainer's circular shape makes it fit more easily over a jar. A strainer may not fit easily over the smaller opening in, say, an empty soda bottle. A plastic bag, which is more soft and flexible, can sink slightly into the bottle. This will cover the opening completely. Use a plastic bag if you're using a bottle."

It's a good idea to keep protective gloves on when squeezing the bottle. If the water gets too cold, you can pour the bottle's contents down the sink. Then, add warm water and repeat the process.
