Make sure the leaves are completely dry before proceeding with the recipe. You can dry out your leaves in an oven or with a dehydrator. Check that the leaves are completely dry. Any residual moisture can cause mold or bacteria to grow in the chow. The dried leaves should be brittle and flaky to the touch."

Break the brittle leaves into small pieces. Feed the pieces of dried leaves into a coffee grinder, herb grinder, or food processor. If there are any chunky pieces after grinding, scoop them into a fine mesh strainer and press the chunks through the mesh with the back side of a spoon."
