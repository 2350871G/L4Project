Cut off the top of the pumpkin, around the stem, and scoop and scrape out all the seeds and pulp. Once that's done, carve any picture you like on the side of the pumpkin, either freehand or using a pumpkin carving template taped to the pumpkin. Kids should only carve under adult supervision. You can find many carving templates online, or in books available at Halloween stores."

Using glue, safety pins, or a drill with adult supervision, add any Halloween or autumn themed objects around the wreath. Try using autumn leaves, black and orange ribbons, or any small, store-bought Halloween decorations. Glow in the dark pumpkins or eyeballs make the wreath extra-spooky for trick-or-treaters."

Trace out a rounded tombstone shape using a circular object, or a marker tied to a string. Cut out the tombstone using any serrated bread knife, jigsaw, or hacksaw. Pencil on inscriptions, then use a utility knife to carve them out. Spray paint the tombstone grey, then use black spray paint to outline the stone, and black marker to fill in the lettering. Children should draw the shape and words, then let an adult cut them out. You can carve the tombstone into many different shapes. Look at photographs of a cemetery online for inspiration. To make the tombstones stand up in your yard, drill a wooden board to the front and back of the tombstone, and bury the boards."

Stick the ghost on a twig and add a green LED light for maximum effect, then put the jar upside-down over the entire scene and tighten the lid.
