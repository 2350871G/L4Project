Place 1 lb (450 g) of ground pork in a large mixing bowl and sprinkle in 1 tsp (4 g) each of ground ginger and garlic powder.

You don\u2019t need to add any oil to the pan because the ground pork has enough fat to keep it from sticking. Drain out any excess fat from the pan when you finish cooking the pork. Use a grater to shred or a knife to finely chop cabbage and carrot. Shred 2 cups (140 g) of cabbage and 2 oz (70 g) of carrot, or approximately 1 medium carrot and 1/4 head of cabbage. Put the shredded cabbage and carrot into a large mixing bowl. You can substitute pre-made coleslaw mix from the grocery store for convenience. Mix together the cooked pork and the shredded cabbage and carrot in a bowl. Add the cooked ground pork to the bowl with the shredded cabbage and carrot. Mix everything together thoroughly with your hands or a spoon until the ingredients are evenly distributed. Shrimp Egg Roll Filling Chop up some cooked shrimp on a cutting board. Use 1 lb (450 g) of cooked, medium-sized shrimp and put it in a medium mixing bowl. You can use pre-cooked shrimp, or you can peel, devein, and cook some raw shrimp before you chop it up. You can tell if shrimp is pre-cooked when you buy it at the grocery store because it will be pink. Combine coleslaw mix, bean sprouts, celery, and green onions with the shrimp.

Add 1 tsp (15 ml ) of sesame oil and mix everything together thoroughly. If you like spicy, you can also add 1 tsp (15 ml ) of Sriracha sauce to the filling and mix it in. Vegetable Egg Roll Filling Shred cabbage and carrots and slice some mushrooms. Shred cabbage with a grater until you have approximately 4 cups (280 g) worth, and carrots until you have 2 cups (140 g) worth and place them into a medium bowl. Slice 4 cups (280 g) of mushrooms and mix them in with the carrots and cabbage. You can use pre-shredded coleslaw mix instead of shredding the carrots and cabbage yourself.

You can add a little bit of peanut or sesame oil while the vegetables cook for more flavor. Mix the cooked vegetables with minced garlic. Drain the vegetables in a strainer before you put them back in your mixing bowl. Mince 5 cloves of garlic and mix the garlic in well with the cooked vegetable mix. Let the vegetable filling cool down to the touch before you fill your egg rolls! Assembling and Cooking Egg Rolls Place an egg roll wrap on a flat surface in front of you with a corner facing you. Use a cutting board or a clean counter as a work surface. The wrap will look like a diamond in front of you. You can find egg roll wraps at Asian or specialty markets. If you can\u2019t find egg roll wraps, you can also use wonton wraps, as they are made from the same kind of dough. Make sure you check how many egg roll wraps you need for the recipe you plan on using and purchase enough! Use a spoon to put a scoop of the filling in the middle of the wrap. Place approximately 1/4 cup (55 g) of the filling in the wrap. Don\u2019t overfill the wrap or it will be hard to roll and seal it. Try to fill each wrap as evenly as possible so that they cook evenly and are all approximately the same size. Fold the bottom of the wrap up, fold the left and right sides in, then roll it up. Fold the bottom corner over the top corner first to make a triangle. Fold the left and right corners in, then roll the whole wrap up. There should be no filling seeping out of the sides of the roll. Beat an egg with a fork or whisk in a bowl and use it to seal the egg rolls. Dip your finger in the beaten egg and wipe the last corner of the roll with the egg to seal it. Wipe some of the beaten egg on any other edges that look like they might come unstuck. You can mix flour and water to make a sealing paste instead of a beaten egg. Heat up 1 qt (946 ml) of peanut oil in a pot or deep fryer. Heat the oil up to approximately 375 degrees F (190 C) in a deep fryer. Use the medium-high setting to heat the oil on the stovetop. Use vegetable oil instead of peanut oil if you can\u2019t find peanut oil. Place the egg rolls into the heated oil and fry them until they are brown.
