Underground dog fences are effective because they allow you to plan around oddly shaped yard features, whereas above-ground fences must usually be built in a straight line. Underground dog fences are mostly used to keep a dog from running away, but they can also be used to prevent your dog from entering areas you don't want it to. For example, you can lay wire around a garden, or around a hot tub."
