Try making bows in a variety of colors, then use them as decor for a bow-tie themed party, or make your own bows to top your holiday presents! Fold the strip of crepe paper in half. Take the loose end of the crepe streamer and fold it back until it touches the roll. Now, you should have a double layer of crepe that's about 4 in (10 cm) long. Feel free to adjust the size so the bow is exactly as wide as you'd like! Continue folding the paper around itself 5-6 times.

This will help stabilize the bow so it will be able to support itself and hold its shape. If you're making a larger bow, you may need more layers of crepe. Cut the paper bow off of the roll. Once you're finished wrapping the crepe paper into the body of your bow, use your scissors to snip the crepe off of the roll. Try to cut the paper so it's just a little shorter than the edge of the bow so it won't show when you're finished. Pinch the center of the folded paper to make a bow shape.

Place the end of the thin crepe paper strip at the back of your bow, right in the middle. Then, wrap the strip around the center of the bow about 3-4 times. Trim any excess and secure the center strip with tape. Bring the end of the center strip around to the back of the bow, then use your scissors to cut off any excess. Finally, use a piece of tape to attach the end of the strip to the rest of the center piece to finish your bow! If you'd prefer, you can use glue or glue dots instead of tape.

        "If you are making a two-toned bow, make sure you keep the same color on the bottom and the same color on the top each time.",
        "Unfold one of the rolls slightly and create a canoe shape.",
        "Take one of your paper rolls and unroll each end about halfway.",
        "Then, shape the paper so it's narrow at the ends and rounded through the center, similar to the shape of a canoe or kayak.",
        "Don't unroll the paper all the way\u2014you want the rolled edges to show in your finished bow.",
        "If the paper does come unrolled, try wrapping it around your skewers again.",
        "Bend the canoe shape backward to make a bow loop, then staple it.",
        "With the rolled edges of the boat shape facing you, fold the 2 narrow ends away from you until they're touching each other.",
        "Then, staple the ends together.",
        "You can also use a glue dot to secure the ends, if you'd prefer.",
        "However, tape isn't a good option, as it may make the finished bow too bulky.",
        "Repeat this for the second roll of paper, then staple the loops together.",
        "Take one of the 2 remaining crepe rolls and shape it in the same way, forming a canoe shape first, then stapling the ends together.",
        "When you're finished, place the stapled ends of your 2 loops together, then staple those pieces to create your bow shape.",
        "Try to make your second piece match the first piece as closely as possible, since these will be the 2 loops of your bow.",
        "Variation: If you want to make a bow with tails, start with 4 rolled pieces of paper.",
        "After you attach the first 2 loops, fluff out the ends of a third piece and bend it into a V shape, then staple it to the back of the bow.",
        "Wrap the fourth piece around the center of the bow, as described below.",
        "Wrap the 3rd roll around the center of your bow and staple it.",
        "Take your third crepe roll and place the end on the back side of your bow in the center.",
        "Then, wrap the bow all the way around the center 1-2 times.",
        "Trim off any excess, then staple the end of this piece at the back of the bow.",
        "This center piece will cover the seams where the 2 loops are joined."
