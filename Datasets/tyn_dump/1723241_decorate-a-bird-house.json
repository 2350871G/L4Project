It\u2019s easiest to start with a plain birdhouse that hasn\u2019t been decorated yet, but if you\u2019re refurbishing an old birdhouse, you can either strip the paint that\u2019s there first or cover it with a few layers of primer before you start.Choose watercolors or acrylic paints based on what type of look you want on your birdhouse. Watercolors will have a lighter, more muted effect, while acrylics will look bolder and more saturated in color. Go for a sunny theme by painting a sunflower around the hole. Paint the entire birdhouse with sky blue paint with a 1 in (2.5 cm) paint brush. Allow that to dry for 24 hours. Then draw an outline for sunflower petals around the hole, using the hole as the sunflower\u2019s center, with black permanent marker. Fill in the petals with golden yellow paint and allow that to dry.Add more sunflowers around the sides of the house and on the roof according to your preference. Use the same golden yellow color for your petals, and black paint for your centers. Add stems and leaves to your sunflowers with green paint if you wish. Write a cute phrase on the front of the house below the sunflower, such as \u201cWelcome\u201d or \u201cHome Tweet Home\u201d in white paint marker, if you like. Try attracting real birds by painting birds and insects on your house. Paint your entire birdhouse a base color of your preference, such as white, black, or blue, with a 1 in (2.5 cm) paint brush. Allow the base to dry for 24 hours, then begin painting your birds on your house. Add some beetles, ladybugs, spiders, or any other insects that you like.Be sure to use bright, vibrant colors like red, blue, and green, especially if you used a dark background. Make a barn theme with dark red and a white picket fence. Paint all 4 sides of your wooden birdhouse a dark brick red with a 1 in (2.5 cm) paint brush. Paint the roof black and cut 20-30 craft sticks so that 10 are flat on both ends and the rest are pointed on one end. Paint the craft sticks white and allow all the paint to dry for 24 hours.Glue the flat-ended craft sticks on the front and sides of the birdhouse to make a door and a large \u201cX\u201d shape on the front.

Making a Mosaic Birdhouse Obtain some mosaic tiles or marbles and grout from a craft store. For this project you will need a wooden birdhouse, mosaic tiles or marbles, and grout. You\u2019ll also need mortar or strong glue to adhere the tiles to the wood. Sketch lines for your design on your birdhouse using pencil.

Using Recycled or Natural Materials Glue junk scrap items on your birdhouse for an eccentric look. Use old keys, buttons, bottle caps, springs, bolts, or any other plastic or metal items to make an antique-looking birdhouse. Simply use strong multi-surface glue to adhere the items in any design you wish.
