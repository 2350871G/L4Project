A smaller crab (~1 lb or below) will take between 8 and 10 minutes to cook. Shock the crab(s) in an ice-water bath for 20 seconds to stop the meat from overcooking.  Serve immediately, or chill in the refrigerator and serve cold. Twist off the claws and legs of the crab.

Crack the crab in half and enjoy the meat inside the body. Steaming Crab Bring to boil a large pot with 1 cup of vinegar, 2 cups of water, and 2 tablespoons of salt. Place one or two tablespoons of Old Bay or Zatarain's seasoning in the liquid instead of the water (optional). While the liquid is boiling, place the crab(s) in the freezer or in a ice-water bath. This will humanely stun the crabs before they are killed, while also helping to keep their limbs intact while they steam. Set a steaming rack above the boiling liquid and place the crab(s) safely onto the steaming rack. Cover with a lid. Set the burner to medium high. Steam the crab(s) for at least 20 minutes. The crab(s) should turn bright orange or red when it is done cooking. Periodically check that the liquid you are steaming with hasn't evaporated.

Serve immediately.  Barbequed Crab Stun the crab first by placing in the freezer for 3 minutes.  Clean the crab. Crack the claw (but do not break off) and remove the eyes, jaws, and tail flap (or apron), as well as flushing out the gills under cold water. Prepare a marinade. Some people prefer melted butter, along with chopped garlic, lemon, and crab seasoning. Try mixing together:\n8 tablespoons olive oil\n1 teaspoon garlic powder\n1 teaspoon lemon pepper seasoning\n1 teaspoon paprika\n1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce\n1 teaspoon salt With a pastry brush, coat the entire crab(s) evenly with the marinade.
