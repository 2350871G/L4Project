However, if the reasons for your sabbatical are time-sensitive and clearly benefit the company, it might be worth asking even if you do not meet these criteria. For example, an intensive training course that would teach you job-relevant skills might be a compelling reason for the company to grant you a short sabbatical even as a relatively new employee."

        "This is essentially work away from work, and can be a compelling reason for your employer to approve a sabbatical if you have a useful independent project proposal.",
        "Depending on your job, you may be developing a new product, process, or theory.",
