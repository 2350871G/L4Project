This doesn't exclude desktops from this but its much more unlikely its built-in and its probably an add-in. If you don't have one, you can still buy a wireless adapter at many stores such as Walmart and Best Buy."

Plug one end directly to your Xbox 360 and plug the other into the PC/Laptop. Almost every PC/Laptop has one of these. If you have both your PC/Laptop and Xbox 360 on, you will see a green light on the PC/Laptop connector and possibly an orange (data) flashing light. This means the connection is working."
