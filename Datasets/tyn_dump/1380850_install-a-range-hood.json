                    "description": "Make sure the range hood is large enough to cover your stovetop and that your space above the stovetop leaves at least 24 inches (60.96 cm) of clearance. If you can, purchase a range hood that extends at least one inch (2.5 cm) over all four sides of your cooking area. Buy a hood with the correct CFM rating. The cfm rating represents how much air the vent can pull each minute, or cubic feet per minute. To find the right cfm rating for your kitchen, multiply the square footage of your kitchen by 2. 250 cfm is a respectable amount for an average-size kitchen, while 400 cfm is excellent. Make sure the range hood you are buying is the correct size that will fit. The most common sizes are 36in, 48in, and 60in. Make sure that a venting range hood will vent through the right spot in the wall. Range hoods will vent either through the cabinets above or through the wall. If you're buying a new range hood and dealing with a pre-existing vent pipe, make sure that both connect easily. If, for example, the range supports cabinet (upper) venting but your existing vent pipe goes through the wall directly behind the vent, you're going to have trouble connecting the two."
