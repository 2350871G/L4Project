Stir constantly to help reduce the volume. Add the sugar. Stir constantly over low heat until the sugar dissolves. Bring the strawberries and sugar to the boil. Boil rapidly until setting point is reached. Remove from the heat. Skim. Let sit to cool for about 20 minutes. When a skin forms on the surface and the fruit sinks, the jam is ready to preserve. Stir gently to evenly distribute the whole strawberries.  Pour the jam into sterilized jars. Cover. When cooled, seal. Label and date. Store in the pantry or a kitchen cupboard. While this doesn't need refrigerating upon opening, this is often a good idea in hot or humid climates to help it last longer. Strawberry Jam Clean the strawberries. Only wash if really needed. Otherwise, wipe them and hull them. Heat the water in a preserving pan or large, heavy-based pot. Use a gentle heat. Add the sugar. Stir until it dissolves while the water is heating. Cook until the soft ball stage. This is 116\u00baC/241\u00baF. Skim the syrup. Add the prepared strawberries. Cook for a few minutes until the juice from the fruit releases. Pick out the strawberries.  Boil the syrup again with the strawberry juice. Boil to the soft ball stage. Put the strawberries back in. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes to jelling stage. This will be 101\u00baC/214\u00baF. If you want the jam to keep longer, boil to the thread stage, 104\u00baC/219\u00baF. Remove from the heat. Pour into sterilized jars. Seal and label. Microwave Strawberry Jam Put the strawberries, lemon juice and sugar into a microwave-proof bowl. Mix gently to combine. Place in the microwave. Cook on high for 20 minutes. Stop the cooking now and then for a quick stir. Test readiness. Pour a little amount onto a cold plate. Let it sit until it goes cold. If it forms a skin when pushed with a finger or spoon edge, it's ready. Add the butter to the jam. Stir until it dissolves into the jam. Let stand for 30 minutes..  Pour the cooled jam into the sterilized bottles. Leave about 1/4cm/1/8 inch from the top. Cover and seal with sterilized lids. Store in a cool and dark place. Refrigerate after opening. Strawberry Conserve Place the hulled strawberries into a large bowl. Sprinkle over the sugar. Cover the strawberries and sugar with plastic food wrap.  Place in the refrigerator. Let chill for 24 hours. Pour the chilled and soaked strawberries into a large heavy-based saucepan or pot the following day. Note that juices will have formed during the chilling time, so be sure to transfer these across too. Heat gently. Stir occasionally. Keep an eye on for the sugar dissolving. Bring the strawberries to the boil when the sugar has dissolved. Then reduce the heat slightly and cook steadily for 5 minutes, stirring now and then. Remove from the heat. Set aside to cool. Once cooled, pour back into a bowl and cover with plastic food wrap. Return to the refrigerator. Leave to chill for 2 days. Pour the chilled mixture into a large pan or pot.  Bring to the boil.
