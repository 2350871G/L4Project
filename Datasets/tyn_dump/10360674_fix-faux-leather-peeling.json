        "Give each coat at least 30 minutes to dry before applying the next coat.",
        "When all the coats have dried, the repaired section will look reasonably similar to non-peeling sections of the faux leather.",
        "Fixing Faux Leather Furniture with Soft Filler Cut off the peeling faux leather with a razor blade.",
        "Before repairing the faux leather, you\u2019ll first need to remove all of the flaking pieces.",
        "Use your fingers and a razor blade to peel, scrape, and cut away the peeling sections of faux leather from your chair or sofa.",
        "Don\u2019t slice off more faux leather than necessary, though.",
        "Only remove what\u2019s already loose and flaking.",
        "You can purchase 5-packs of razor blades at most hardware stores.",
        "Exercise caution when using a razor blade and never cut towards yourself.",
        "Apply leather soft filler to the peeled area with a putty knife.",
        "Scoop out a 1 inch (2.5 cm) dollop of soft filler with a putty knife.",
        "Still using the knife, smear the filler across the peeled section of the leather furniture.",
        "Smooth out the filler so that it\u2019s a uniform thickness across the peeled section.",
        "Try not to get filler on the unpeeled sections of the faux leather.",
        "Soft filler will bond with the base fabric of the faux leather and create a new vinyl-like surface.",
        "You can purchase it at any leather store and at many craft supply stores.",
        "Push the soft filler off of the furniture seams and smooth the surface.",
        "If you happened to apply any filler to the furniture\u2019s seams, you can use a stiff piece of paper to rub if off.",
        "Use the edge of an index or business card to push filler out of the seam.",
        "Then, run the long edge of the card over the top of the fabric you\u2019re repairing to smooth out the layer of filler.",
        "Clearing the seams and feathering the edges of the soft filler will give the repair job a more professional look.",
        "Let the soft filler cure for 20 minutes.",
        "The filler will cure relatively quickly.",
        "It\u2019s important that you don\u2019t touch the filler while it\u2019s curing.",
        "If you have small children or pets in your home, keep them out of the room with the curing filler.",
        "If you\u2019re repairing a small chair, you could move the chair outdoors and let it sit in the sun if the weather is pleasant.",
        "This will speed up the curing process.",
        "Apply a second layer of soft filler to the patch you\u2019re repairing.",
        "Once the first layer has dried, use your putty knife to apply a second thick layer of filler to the leather.",
        "As before, avoid spreading the filler onto undamaged parts of the faux leather.",
        "Add texture to the repair job by pressing plastic wrap against it.",
        "Tear off a 12 in (30 cm) piece of plastic wrap and warp it around your hand.",
        "Press your plastic-covered palm against the semi-dry second layer of soft filler.",
        "When you lift your hand off, the area will be slightly textured.",
        "Repeat this process until you\u2019ve lightly textured the entire section you\u2019re repairing.",
        "Texture will help the repaired section match the rest of the faux leather.",
        "If the surface of your faux leather furniture is completely smooth, you won\u2019t need to add any texturing to the soft filler.",
        "In that case, you can skip this step.",
        "Apply leather paint to the repaired patch with a damp sponge.",
        "Squeeze a generous amount of leather paint onto a dampened sponge.",
        "The dollop should be about 2 inches (5.1 cm) in diameter.",
        "Then, use the sponge to smear the leather paint across the entire repaired section of the faux leather.",
        "Work in long, smooth strokes, and apply a uniformly thin coat across the section you\u2019re repairing.",
        "Overlap the paint with the undamaged faux leather by about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) so that the sections blend together.",
        "You can find leather paint at any leather goods store and at many large hobby shops.",
        "Look through the store\u2019s selection to find a color of leather paint that matches the furniture you\u2019re repairing.",
        "If you can\u2019t find a color of paint that matches your chair or sofa, try mixing together a shade of paint that\u2019s slightly lighter than your furniture and 1 that\u2019s slightly darker."
