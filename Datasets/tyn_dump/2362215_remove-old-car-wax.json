Strictly speaking, a spray on wax remover is a more legitimate pre-wax cleaner. Spray on wax removers strip the wax off a car but do not do much else. They do not clean deep and do not remove contaminants that lurk below the surface. However, because they do not cleanse deeply, they make a good choice for someone who likes to frequently strip old wax and apply new wax. Non-abrasive polishes cleanse a little more deeply. They are used for less frequent strippings and clean dirt that settles beneath the surface of the paint. Their primary purpose is not to remove wax, but that is a secondary effect."

By removing as much dirt from the surface as possible, you allow the chemicals in the pre-wax cleaner to get directly to the layer of wax instead of having to contend with layers of grime and gunk first.

Use a soft terry cloth to wipe the wax remover along the paint using side to side and top to bottom motions. Spread the wax remover using long, even strokes. Reapply as necessary. If your first application of wax remover did not remove all the wax, you may apply another coating. Avoid repeating this too often, however, since too many applications on unprotected paint can gradually start to damage the point. Apply all-purpose cleaner to the rag to clean the trim. Since plastic and rubber can become discolored when you use wax removers, a milder all-purpose car exterior cleanser is a better option. Apply the cleaner directly onto a clean terry cloth rag. Gently rub the surface of the trim. Apply light, even pressure along the trim to remove as much of the old wax as possible. Using Detailing Clay Wash and dry your car before using the clay bar. It is best to remove surface dirt from the paint before using the clay bar. The amount of dirt particles being picked up by the bar will be reduced, thereby allowing the bar to pick up more of the wax. Work with a small area at a time. You should use the clay bar on an area that is no bigger than 2x2 feet (61x61 centimeters). This way, you can focus on each area more thoroughly, leading to more even removal. Spray clay lubricant directly on the surface. Some clay bars come with clay lubricant, but sometimes, you may need to purchase it separately. A clay lubricant creates a smooth surface for the clay bar to pass over, making it easier for the clay to glide along the surface of the car without leaving pieces behind.
