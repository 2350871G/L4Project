Choose a towel with a spot that isn\u2019t too worn so your washcloths still look fresh. Make a zigzag stitch or sew a hem either by hand or with a sewing machine to prevent the towel from fraying.

Trim off any frayed edges as well. Then, set aside the towels to scrub gunk in your kitchen, bathroom, or anywhere else. If you need something thicker, stitch a pair of smaller washcloths together."

The extra padding could mean the difference between something getting to your destination in one piece or in fragments. It also means you don\u2019t need to buy packing peanuts or rely on newspapers that could leave ink stains. Towels are also good for keeping things dry and absorbing spilled liquids.

Then, create the pad liner out of an absorbent towel. Stitch it onto the center of the pad to create something reusable and eco-friendly. For instance, the liner is the long, oval-shaped pad that fits along the middle of the base cloth you stitch together. Find it on a regular pad to see where to place it on your handmade one. Remember to wash the cloth pad with soap and water before using it. Cloth pads are reusable, so they are great for saving money and cutting down plastic waste."

Try making a patchwork rug by cutting towels into squares or stripes and sewing them together. Another option is to cut towels into 3 in (7.6 cm)-wide strips, then use them to create a circular mat.

You can take some liberties to design the cover up any way you want. For example, cut curves into the top of the towels to create a deeper neckline. You could also cut a towel to make a sash to tie across your waist. If a regular beach towel is too big for you, try folding a single towel in half and making the cover up out of it.
