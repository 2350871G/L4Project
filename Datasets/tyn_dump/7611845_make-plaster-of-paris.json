Use either a microwave or a stove to heat the water to the correct temperature. Combine the water with 2 cups (256 g) of flour in a mixing bowl. Pour the water over the flour as evenly as you can. Once all the water is added, start stirring the mix with a spoon or spatula. If you\u2019re worried about dried plaster sticking to your utensils, use a disposable plastic spoon. Stir the mixture with a spatula until there are no lumps. The consistency should be a thick white paste when you\u2019re finished. In the end, the plaster should be thick, but not difficult to stir. If it seems too thick, add more water. If it is too runny, add more flour until it thickens. Work with the plaster within 10 minutes. You\u2019ll notice the plaster mixture will start to solidify as you work with it. Pour the mixture into your molds as soon as you\u2019ve finished stirring it for the best results.
