Through an online search or by borrowing a chart at a road bike store, find the bike height that is associated with your total height. Use the chart to find whether you need an extra small, small, medium, large, or extra large road bike frame. You can convert your height from inches to centimeters by multiplying it by 2.54. Road bike height charts should not be used as the only resource for sizing a road bike, but are a good starting point for the basic frame size you should be looking for. Some road bike charts are more specific, with up to 6 or 7 categories of bike frame sizes."

Getting the Right Sized Top Tube Measure your torso length. With a tape measure, record the distance from your hip to your shoulder.
