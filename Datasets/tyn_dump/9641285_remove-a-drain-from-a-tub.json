    "text": " Removing Different Types of Drain Stoppers Unscrew a foot plug drain\u2019s stopper. Put on your rubber gloves and grasp the center stopper. Turn it counterclockwise while pulling up slightly. After enough turns, the stopper should unscrew fully from the drain. Foot plug drains will have a stopper in the center of the drain that moves up and down when the tub is stopped. Pop out a lift-and-turn drain\u2019s stopper. Grasp the stopper and pull up on it. You should see a setscrew underneath the stopper\u2019s cap. Use your screwdriver to remove this, and the stopper should then come out. Tap or nudge it with the screwdriver if it seems stuck. Lift-and-turn drains will also have a stopper in the center of the drain, but will be activated by grasping and turning them. Remove the faceplate of a trip lever drain.

Installing the New Drain Apply new plumber's putty. Grab some from the container so you have a ball about an inch in diameter. Roll it between your hands until you have a log about 5 to 7 inches (13 to 18 cm) long and pencil-thick. Wrap this around the bottom of the replacement drain's lip. Screw the new drain basket in for a foot plug or lift-and-turn drain. Set the basket in the drain hole and turn it clockwise by hand as far as you can. Then tighten it further with the drain wrench. Use a different head than before, if necessary. Insert the plunger and screw in the drain basket for a trip lever drain. Check the drain's instructions for exact details on your drain model. Generally, you will insert the plunger into the drain hole, then reattach it to the trip lever using a setscrew. Finally, screw the drain basket into the drain hole. Scrape off the putty that squeezes out. As the replacement drain is screwed in, some of the putty will be pushed out. Use your finger or a knife to scrape off this excess. Screw in the new stopper, if the drain has one. Find the hole in the center of the drain basket. Insert the new stopper into this. Turn it clockwise to tighten it. Not all drains will have stoppers, but those that do will simply screw in the drain basket this way. Test for leaks. Activate the tub stopper or trip lever, and fill the tub halfway with water.
