                    "description": "The wool needs to be damp before you dye it, otherwise it won't pick up the color. The wool doesn't need to soak for a specific amount of time, so you can prepare the water and dye in the meantime. Gently squeeze the wool under the water. This ensures that it soaks up the water evenly. For best results, use white felted wool. You can try off-white, ivory, or a very pale gray, but be aware that the dye won't come out exactly the way it looks on the package. You can dye less than 1 pound (454 g) of wool, but you shouldn't dye more using this recipe."

In order to get the shade that's on the package, plan on using 1/2 bottle of liquid fabric dye or 1 packet of powdered fabric dye. Alternatively, you can use a sugar-free, powdered drink mix, such as Kool Aid. You can also use less dye for a lighter shade, if you prefer. Shake bottled dye first; this ensures that the dye particles dissolve properly. One packet of powdered drink mix is enough to dye an 8 \u20442 by 11 in (22 by 28 cm) sheet of wool.

Move the felt around often as it dries, otherwise the wire grid will leave creases. If the wool came out wrinkled, iron it using the cool or wool setting on your iron."
