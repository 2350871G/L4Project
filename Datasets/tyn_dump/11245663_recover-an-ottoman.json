Some ottomans will have wheels or pegs that slide directly out, so try pulling a peg or wheel out first to see if it budges. Unscrew the brackets attaching any wheels with a screwdriver. Unscrew pegs by twisting them counterclockwise. Set these pieces aside to reinstall them later. You may have to apply some firm pressure to the pegs to get them to turn. Don\u2019t worry about breaking them since you can always install new pegs later or let the ottoman sit directly on the floor if you break them off."

If the fabric is stitched into the bottom, use a utility knife to cut through the fabric around the entire outside of the stitching. If you cut around the stitching, you\u2019re going to be carving into the frame a little bit. This shouldn\u2019t harm the structural integrity of your ottoman though, and any marks that you make will be covered by the time that you\u2019re done. You can use wire cutters, a flathead screwdriver, or pliers instead of a painter\u2019s tool to remove the staples if you prefer. It really depends on how strong and big the staples are when it comes to finding the right tool to remove them. Some ottomans will use both staples and stitching. Repeat this process on the second half of your ottoman if you separated it into 2 pieces."

You could damage the padding if you rip the fabric off too quickly and you don\u2019t want to cut your hand on a staple. Choosing and Cutting the New Fabric Select a thick fabric that can be easily cut and buy some wide sheets. Cotton blends and synthetic fabrics, like acrylic, will be easier to work with than silk or linen. Choose a thicker fabric that won\u2019t rip easily when you fold it. Choose darker colors to make it easier to hide mistakes or structures underneath. Buy rolls of fabric that are at least 4 times the length of your ottoman in any direction. You can buy fabric rolls from a knitting or craft store. You can also order custom sheets online if you want precut fabric. Measure the length of the top and sides of your ottoman. Use a measuring tape to determine the length and width of the top of your ottoman. Draw and label this portion on a piece of paper. Then, measure each side all the way to the base. Add these labels to your drawing by illustrating the 4 sides as separate boxes that share a side with your center box.

Place 1 staple every 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) until you reach the last 3\u20135 inches (7.6\u201312.7 cm) near the corner.Tip: Leave at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) of fabric at each corner unstapled. This will give you enough room to fold the corners back and make them flush with the edge of the frame. If you have a circular ottoman, choose 3-5 6 in (15 cm) sections to leave unstapled. Fold the seam along the corner by pulling the fabric tight towards the center. Pull the unstapled corner of your fabric up so that it matches the corner of your frame. Pull the corner inwards towards the center of the ottoman while sliding the excess fabric on either side underneath it. Once the fabric is folded on top of itself, hold it still by applying pressure to the top with your nondominant hand. If your ottoman is round, fold only one side of the fabric underneath itself. Fold the fabric in the same direction for every seam that you make. Punch 3-4 staples through your fabric into the frame. Keep the corner braced with your nondominant hand and pick up your staple gun in your dominant hand. Use your staple gun to shoot 3-4 staples into the frame. Spread your staples out along the folded corner so that every folded side has at least 1 staple attaching it to the frame. Leave at least 3\u20134 inches (7.6\u201310.2 cm) between your nondominant hand and the staple gun to keep your other hand safe. Repeat this process for every corner of your ottoman. If you have 2 sections, you\u2019ll need to do this a total of 8 times, since each piece will have 4 corners. With each fold, check the seam along the frame\u2019s side to ensure that it is folding in the same direction every time. If it isn\u2019t, simply re-fold your corner so that the seam folds in the other direction. If you separated your ottoman into 2 pieces, you can either keep the fabric in the middle of your bottom piece, or cut along the edges of your frame with your utility knife to remove it. Cut the excess fabric or fold it over itself. You can fold the fabric over itself 2-3 times to flatten it, or simply cut it off with sewing scissors. If you fold it, pull the excess fabric up and fold the fabric to the left or the right down against the opposite side by sliding your other hand over it as you fold. Use 2-3 staples to secure the additional folds to the fabric. Use the same folding direction and style of fold for every corner. Staple your bottom cover into the base of your fabric. Place your rectangular or circular cover over the center opening. Place one staple into the middle of any side and stretch the cover across the opposite side before placing a staple on the opposite side. Repeat this process while working around the frame and place a staple for every 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) of frame. Place your staples above or below the staples for your upholstery. Use sewing scissors to trim the excess fabric if you cut out a new cover for the bottom. You won\u2019t need to trim anything if you\u2019re using the old covers. Reinstall your wheels or pegs by screwing them back in. Use your utility knife to cut a 1 inch (2.5 cm) X-shaped slit through the fabric where your wheels or pegs belong. Either screw your peg back in by rotating it into the threading of the frame, or use a screwdriver to reinstall the brackets where they belong with the original screws. You may need to cut several openings if the bracket for your screws was particularly big. You can also opt to use the flat base of your ottoman as the bottom and choose to simply not use the pegs or the wheels.",
