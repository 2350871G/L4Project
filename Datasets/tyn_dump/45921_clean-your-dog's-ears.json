Look for any drainage of fluid from the ear (clear or gray/brown), thick waxy material, or any scratches, scabs or wounds. If you see any of these signs DO NOT clean the ear and contact your dog\u2019s veterinarian for advice. You will not be able to see deep into the ear canal, as at the base of the ear, where it meets the head, it takes a sharp turn. Therefore, it is not advised to do a deep cleaning into the ears without instructions from your veterinarian. NEVER use a Q tip in the canal itself as you can compact material into this sharp turn or even rupture the eardrum."

Dogs that frequently run through grasses or wooded areas can get foreign bodies such as plant awns, grass, or seeds in their ears. If you notice any of these problems, you can first try to (very gently) remove the offending object or try to clean the ears to remove these things. If this doesn\u2019t work, you will need to take your dog to your veterinary professional. Mites, ticks and fleas all enjoy the relatively hidden spots in and around the ears. Mites make the ears intensely itchy and can make the ear produce a thick, brown discharge. You will need to have a veterinarian diagnose and treat ear mites. Ticks and fleas can be killed (and prevented) by the various topical flea and tick prevented easily purchased from your veterinarian."
