Take each chunk of hair out of the packages individually, and hold them in the center, cutting off the elastic bands holding it together. With a grip on the center and the 2 tail ends of the hair hanging down, begin pulling the strands on 1 side of the hair. This will give the ends of your hair a more natural look, otherwise the packaged hair is blunt-cut straight across and your braids will look a bit unnatural when you\u2019re finished. Choose your braid hair in a color similar to your own, and get at least 2 large packages. The longer and thicker you want your braids to be, the more packages of braid hair you will need. If you want shorter braids, use fewer packages and cut the braid hair into halves or thirds. When you\u2019re pulling the hair, gently tug at small strands rather than big portions of hair. Run your fingers through the hair when you\u2019re finished evening out the ends to remove any knots that might have shown up."

You can do \u2018micro twists,\u2019 which use dozens of teeny-tiny braids, or you can do jumbo twists that use 1-inch (2.5 cm) sections or larger of hair. Small twists will last much longer than large twists, but the process is obviously more time-consuming. Decide what size you want based on your personal style and the amount of time you have to work on your hair. Prepare your first section. Use a rat-tail comb to part a section of hair to your desired size. The section of hair should be a square in shape. Rub a bit of style gel or cream through your hair and mist it with a little water and olive oil to reduce frizz and make it easier to manipulate. Use your comb to brush through this section several times, to make sure that the hair is completely smooth and tangle-free. Start twisting your first section. Split your section of hair into 2 equal strands. Begin winding them tightly away from your head in a rope-like pattern. You\u2019ll simply wrap the strands simultaneously around each other to create a twist. To keep it tight, you\u2019ll want to pull the twist tight to your scalp as you work. Finish your first twist. When you near the end of your strand and begin running out of hair to twist, you will need to switch to doing a 1-strand twist to secure the ends. To do this, take the 2 strands and combine them together (there shouldn\u2019t be much hair left to do this with). Then, wrap this section around your finger many times, in the same direction you were twisting the 2 strands of hair. This will curl the ends of the hair in the same direction, securing them in place. This method works best if your hair is naturally curly rather than chemically relaxed or permed. Repeat the twisting process on the rest of your hair. Continue working your way across your scalp, creating your 2-strand twists. The process is the exact same for each twist, just make sure that you section off equal amounts of hair so that all your twists are the same size. Section a small piece of hair, comb it, and apply your gel or cream. Split your section into 2 equal strands. Wrap the strands around each other to form a rope-braid. Twist the ends of the 2-strand braid together to secure them and prevent the braid from unravelling.",

        "As you add in hair, pull the braid tight and keep your fingers close to your head.",
        "Don\u2019t braid your hair away from your head, as this will make your cornrows loose and appear funny.",
        "Finish your cornrow.",
        "When you get to the nape of your neck, you may or may not run out of hair.",
