You can use any size of tassels, but you'll probably want to use lots of tassels if they're shorter than 1 inch (2.5 cm). Start with at least a few dozen and decide if you'd like more tassels on the hemline. Unlike fringe, tassels are sold individually so the package size will vary. Use tassels of the same color for a monochromatic look or pick a variety of colors that complement the fabric. For example, to make a white dress bright, use tassels with bold colors, such as red, pink, yellow, and green. If you're adding tassels to a neutral-colored fabric, use white, black, or gray tassels."
