Take a look at the different types of shells, and see how they could be put together to form a crown. For example, pointy turret shells that look like unicorn horns would make great points for your crown. Starfish, sand dollars, or scalloped shells could make pretty centerpieces. Gather the shells for your crown. Try to get an assortment of shells, such as: scalloped/fan shaped shells, pointy \"unicorn horn\" turret shells, conch shells, and snail/cat's eye shells.

It would also be a good idea to buy some embellishments and fillers, such as: pearl beads, glass beads, sea glass, and tiny rhinestones. You can use these to fill in any gaps. You don't have to head out to the beach to get shells. You can buy bags of them from the craft store. Paint the shells with pearly acrylic paint, then let them dry. You can paint all of the shells the same color, or you can use different colors. Purple and teal are great options, but you can use other colors too, such as pearl, pink, or gold.

Pick out your pointy shells, and glue then along the edges of your crown. Make sure that the opening of the shell is facing the tiara's band; this way, the hole won't be visible in the end.
