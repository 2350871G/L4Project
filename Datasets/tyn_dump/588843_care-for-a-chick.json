Keep the habitat in a space where your chick can\u2019t fall or escape and where pets can\u2019t gain access to her. Consider putting a ventilated lid on the habitat for times when you are not home or unable to watch your chick. This can keep other animals out while protecting your chick from falling out of the cage. Avoid putting the habitat in any spaces that are very high off the ground.

Construct a heat source using a 100watt light bulb in a reflective clamp style lamp or an infrared reptile heat bulb. Install either option on one side of the habitat. You can get both lamps at most pet and home stores. Make sure the temperature is a constant 90-100 degrees for the first few weeks of the chick\u2019s life. Your chick is the best thermometer for her habitat: if she is hiding on the opposite corner of the habitat from the lamp, then it is too hot. If she is smothering herself in the blankets or along with other chicks, then you need to increase the heat.

If you decide to build the coop yourself, you will need to incorporate some of the following elements: four walls, a roosting bar, a nest box, windows for ventilation, and a door with a secure latch. Take safety precautions when setting up the coop. Raise it 6\u20138 inches (15.2\u201320.3 cm) off of the ground to prevent rodent infestation and cover or replace any ventilation holes with cloth wire instead of chicken wire to prevent injury.

        "While it\u2019s tempting to pick up a cute colored chick at Easter or have one in a classroom, remember that baby chicks are animals and not toys.",
        "Many people think it\u2019s acceptable to release a chick into their backyards or an animal shelter when it grows beyond the cute, fuzzy stage.",
        "Before you get your chick, make sure you are fully committed to caring for it over the course of its life.",
        "Maintain habitat cleanliness.",
        "A clean habitat is key to your chick\u2019s health.",

        "Remove any soiled lining and replace it as necessary.",
        "Replace all of the lining at least once a week.",

        "Wipe down any soiled walls or bases.",
        "If you are using a cardboard box, consider giving your chick a new one if it is soiled or smells bad.",
        "Feed your chick.",
        "Your chick will eat special food for the first few months of her life.",
        "Make sure she has plenty of food and allow her to graze throughout the day on it.",
        "Provide your chick food specially formulated for chicks for the first two months of her life.",
        "You may get either a medicated or non-medicated food depending on your chick\u2019s needs or your personal preference.",
        "You can get chick food at either your vet\u2019s office or a pet store.",
        "Switch to grower feed, which is about 17% protein, when your chick turns two months old.",
        "After another two months, you\u2019ll switch the feed again to a slightly lower protein choice or a layer feed.",
        "Make sure your chick has a constant supply of food and water because she will grow quickly.",

        "Check the dish a couple of times a day to make sure your chick has enough water and that it\u2019s clean.",
        "Place a dirt bath in the habitat.",
        "Most birds \u201cbathe\u201d themselves and clean their feathers by flapping around in dirt or sand.",
        "Put a small dish of either material in the habitat for your chick to keep herself clean.",
        "Be aware that not all chicks will take baths.",
        "Your chick may wait until she is older and this is entirely normal.",
        "Play with your chick.",
        "It\u2019s also important to the health of your chick that she receives plenty of attention from you.",
        "Chicks are friendly and curious and can form a bond with you.",
        "In addition, it can be fun to watch your chick\u2019s interactions with you and other chicks.",
        "Give your chick a name and make sure to talk to her using this name during your play.",
        "Hold and stroke her for at least a few minutes multiple times a day.",
        "Consider allowing her time to roam outside of her habitat during the day.",
        "However, make sure you watch her during this time so she doesn\u2019t injure herself or doesn\u2019t fall prey to another animal.",
        "Schedule a babysitter.",

        "Check or listen for signs of wheezing or limping, which can signal a problem with your chick\u2019s lungs or leg development.",
        "Examine your chick\u2019s poop, too.",
        "Diarrhea can cause matted feathers or clogged cloaca, which are the openings to the digestive and urinary tracts.",
        "Avoid introducing chicks from different flocks to your chick, as these can also introduce disease.",
        "Schedule an appointment with your vet if you see any signs of illness or are concerned about your chick.",
        "Helping Your Chick Transition into Adulthood Watch for feathers.",
        "One of the first signs of your chick developing into an adult chicken is her sprouting feathers.",
        "In most cases, you will see feathers developing a few days after your chick has hatched.",
        "Continue to monitor your chick over the next few weeks to make sure she\u2019s properly growing feathers.",
        "The rate of feather development should increase over the following weeks and your fluffy chick will appear more like a grown chicken.",
        "Be aware that it\u2019s common for your chick to go through a phase of looking awkward while she is transitioning.",
        "Don\u2019t be surprised if she has long, gangly legs and scraggly feathers.",
        "This phase is comparatively short.",
        "Promote growth with diet.",
        "You may notice that once your chick starts sprouting feathers that her appetite also increases.",
        "Make sure to give your chick the proper food to her age and always provide a source of water.",
        "Feed your chick her starter rations until she is about 18 weeks old.",
        "At about 18-20 weeks, switch her food to a layer feed, which has extra calcium to help her grow.",
        "Consider getting a well-balanced layer feed at your local pet store or vet\u2019s office.",
        "These feeds have the right protein, vitamins, and nutrients to help your chick grow into a chicken.",
        "Avoid feeding your chick scratch if you can afford it.",
        "Although your chick might love the taste, it doesn\u2019t necessarily have all of the nutrients need for proper growth.",
        "Consider giving her scratch as a treat.",
        "Make sure your chick has a consistent source of clean food and water.",
        "Spread it in her habitat and keep a dish of water readily available.",
        "As your chick grows, you may want to check the habitat a few times a day to ensure that your chick has enough food and water.",
        "Move your chick into a coop.",
        "Your chick will eventually outgrow her cozy habitat that you created.",
        "Even if you plan on allowing your chick to range freely on your property, she will still need a coop to protect her from predators and bad weather.",
        "You can either purchase a commercially constructed coop or build one yourself.",
        "Your chick will need 2-3 square feet of space to live comfortably.",
        "You can buy coops at many pet stores or consider getting one secondhand.",
        "If you decide to build the coop yourself, you will need to incorporate some of the following elements: four walls, a roosting bar, a nest box, windows for ventilation, and a door with a secure latch.",
        "Take safety precautions when setting up the coop.",
        "Raise it 6\u20138 inches (15.2\u201320.3 cm) off of the ground to prevent rodent infestation and cover or replace any ventilation holes with cloth wire instead of chicken wire to prevent injury.",
        "Make sure to check the latch because raccoons are very good at opening latches.",
        "Move your growing chick when it is at least 55 degrees at night inside the coop.",
        "Remember that your chick will still be sensitive to temperatures as she grows and may need to stay inside longer to promote healthy development.",
        "Be aware that although there is usually no problem introducing your chick into a coop with other chickens, she may be hesitant at first.",
        "Introduce her gradually and gently to the flock through playtime outdoors or putting her in the coop for a few minutes a day until she is ready to move more permanently.",
        "Keep the coop clean.",
        "Your growing chick will continue to need a clean habitat to promote her health and well-being.",
        "Sweep out the coop at least once a week and check the food and water dishes daily to ensure there isn\u2019t any moldy or old food or algae growing on the water."
