        "Pulse until the solid ingredients, like garlic or peppers, have been finely minced and incorporated into the mayo.",
        "Gradually whisk in 1/3 of the oil.",
        "Add 1/4 cup (60 ml) of olive oil to the mixture 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) at a time, whisking continuously.",
        "This should take about 4 minutes.",
        "If the bowl begins to move around as you whisk, place a kitchen towel beneath it to hold it steady.",
        "While whisking by hand will still work well, this is the point at which a food processor really comes in handy.",
        "If using a food processor or blender, add the oil through the hole at the top of the lid.",
        "Continue to hold the pulse button down to steadily and continuously blend in the oil.",
        "Add the remaining oil slowly.",
        "Add the remaining 1/2 cup (125 ml) of olive oil to the mayo mixture in a slow, thin stream.",
        "Continue whisking continually as you add the rest of the oil.",
        "This step should take roughly 8 minutes.",
        "The spicy mayonnaise should be fairly thick once you finish adding the oil.",
        "If using a food processor, add the remaining oil in through the hole at the top of the lid.",
        "Continue to hold down the pulse button so that the contents are continuously mixed together.",
        "Chill until ready to serve.",
        "Cover the dish with a lid or plastic wrap and leave the condiment in the refrigerator until you are ready to use it.",
        "You should use fresh mayonnaise within 5 days.",
        "To beautify your efforts, cut up a thin, red, thai chili and distribute in the middle of your mayo.",
        "This adds a fun color contrast and gives your mayo a professional look.",
        "Whipping Up Vegan Spicy Mayo Blend together the flax seeds and almond milk.",
        "Combine the two ingredients in a blender at high speed until the flax seeds are almost impossible to distinguish.",
        "This should take roughly 1 minute or so.",
        "The resulting mixture should be very frothy.",
        "Choose a milk with the most neutral taste and smoothest texture possible.",
        "Unsweetened almond milk and unflavored soy milk are recommended.",
        "Avoid hemp or oat milk.",
        "You could use a food processor instead of a blender for this recipe, if desired.",
        "Whisking the ingredients by hand could also work, but it will be much more difficult to fully incorporate the flax seeds into the almond milk if you mix it by hand.",
        "The flax seeds replace the eggs in this recipe and are responsible for binding and thickening the spicy vegan mayo.",
        "They must be well blended before this thickening ability is activated, though.",
        "Add the seasonings.",
        "Transfer the sugar, dry mustard, onion powder, salt, paprika, and hot sauce to the contents of the blender and blend for another 30 seconds or so on high speed.",
        "Make sure that the hot sauce you use is vegan-friendly.",
        "If desired, you could skip the hot sauce altogether and use 3 small chilli padi, chopped into fine pieces.",
        "Mix in the acidic ingredients.",
        "Add the lemon juice and vinegar to the mayo mixture in the blender.",
        "Blend for another few seconds on high speed until combined.",
        "As with traditional egg-based mayonnaise, the lemon juice and vinegar in this recipe add acidity and flavor to the mayo.",
        "Slowly add the oil.",
        "Add the grapeseed oil in 1 Tbsp (15 ml) batches.",
        "Blend for a full 30 seconds after adding each batch of oil.",
        "Alternatively, you can slowly add the oil to the mayo mixture through the hole in the top of the lid in a slow, steady, and continuous stream.",
        "The essential thing is that the oil must be added slowly and evenly.",
        "Otherwise, the texture will not be consistent.",
        "Pause the blender every now and then when it starts to get hot.",
        "Otherwise, it will cause the mayo to heat up along with it.",
        "The mayo should begin to thicken after you have added half the oil.",
        "After you have added 3/4 of the oil, it should be spreadable.",
        "The final addition will create a thick consistency.",
        "Refrigerate for several hours.",
        "Scoop the spicy vegan mayo into a glass container and cover with a tight lid or plastic wrap.",
        "Refrigerate it for a few hours to let it thicken and store in the refrigerator when not in use.",
        "This mayo has a very strong, potent flavor initially.",
        "Chilling it in the refrigerator will help the taste mellow down and blend more evenly.",
        "Use this version within a week.",
        "Finished.",
        "Preparing Horseradish Spicy Mayo Prepare your horseradish.",
        "If using pre-made horseradish, simply measure out your called amount.",
        "Fresh horseradish will be significantly more potent than pre-made, so caution is needed when chopping it.",
        "To prepare it, simply chop up your horseradish root.",
        "Pour it into a food processor, add a few drops of water, and grind it up.",
        "Now you\u2019ll have a paste similar to pre-made horseradish.",
        "When using fresh, you may wish to lower the amount called for in your recipe by half or more.",
        "Always remember it is easier to make something more spicy, than it is to make something less spicy.",
        "Combine all your ingredients.",
        "Using a whisk, mix your mayonnaise, horseradish, chives, lemon juice and pepper.",
        "Whisk until the color of the mayonnaise is solid, and even.",
        "There should be no streaks.",
        "Use a metal or glass bowl when making horseradish mayo.",
        "Horseradish is significantly more pungent than onions or chilis, and making your mayo in a plastic dish can leave a smell or flavour that is less-than-desirable after removing the mayo.",
        "Cover and refrigerate until you wish to devour your spicy horseradish mayo.",
        "Your mayonnaise will improve in flavour, but also spiciness, with age.",
        "If you can, make it the night before it is needed so the flavours have time to blend together and become more full."
