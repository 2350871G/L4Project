                    "description": "The most important thing to keep in mind when preparing to clean an acrylic painting is that the paint must be completely dry. If it\u2019s still wet, you may smudge the outermost layer of paint, dulling the colors and wearing down distinctive features, such as the artist\u2019s brushstrokes. Once acrylic paint has cured, you can carefully clean the outer surface without worrying about causing damage. Wait at least 24 hours before attempting to clean newly-completed paintings. The slightest blemish on an original piece of artwork may be enough to depreciate its value."
