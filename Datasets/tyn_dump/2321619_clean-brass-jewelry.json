                    "description": "It won\u2019t take much soapy water to clean your jewelry, so pour about 1 cup (240 mL) of warm water into a cup or a bowl, then add 3-4 drops of mild dish soap. Gently stir the water to make sure the soap is mixed in evenly. Soap and water are perfect for a gentle clean that will remove dirt and grime from brass without removing its patina, or the aged layer that develops on older pieces over time. Tip: Does your brass jewelry stick to a magnet? If so, that means it's brass-coated, rather than solid brass, so you should only clean it with soap and water. Other methods can wear away the brass coating over time."

                    "description": "Although this is a very mild cleaning method, if you\u2019re trying to preserve the patina of a piece, it\u2019s always a good idea to do a quick test before you clean the whole item. Dip a cotton swab in or the corner of a cloth into the soapy water, then gently rub it onto a hidden piece of the jewelry, like the back of a pendant or near the clasp on a chain. If the patina starts to come off or you\u2019re concerned the water will harm the brass item, you may want to consider having the piece cleaned professionally."

You may need to go over the same spot more than once to get it as clean as you want, but avoid scrubbing too hard, as you could scratch the brass. A toothbrush is best for an item with a lot of crevices, like an ornate pendant or ring, while a cloth is more gentle for jewelry with a lot of flat surfaces, like a cuff bracelet. For stubborn dirt, soak the jewelry for 2-3 minutes in the water before you clean it with the cloth. Be sure to choose a toothbrush that\u2019s only used for cleaning!"
