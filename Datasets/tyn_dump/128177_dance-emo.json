There are different types of emo music, which include emotive hardcore, Midwest emo (often known as indie rock post-emo), hardcore emo, screamo, and emoviolence. As the decades passed, emo music took out and included different characteristics, creating new sub-genres. Many emo and screamo bands are: Rites of Spring, Embrace, Dag Nasty, Drive Like Jehu, American Football, City of Caterpillar, Circle Takes The Square, Jawbreaker, Heroin, Hot Water Music, Sunny Day Real Estate, Indian Summer, Jets to Brazil, Braid, Saetia, Cap'n Jazz, Mineral, I Hate Myself, The Academy Is..., Saves the Day and Empire!

True to the non-commercialism ideals emo bands sell their music very cheaply around $5 or so, and most bands do not sell t-shirts. So instead, you may DIY your own and comply with the DIY ethic. Live emo bands often play with their backs to the audience during the slow parts of the song. Then they explode by screaming and jumping around during the faster-paced parts, usually knocking things over as they go.
