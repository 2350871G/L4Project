Using a Circular Saw Set the blade depth of your circular saw to 2 inches (5.1 cm). Release the blade lever and move the base plate that surrounds the saw until 2 inches (5.1 cm) of the saw is exposed. Once the blade is the right depth, tuck your finger under the shoe with your index finger to hold it steady and tighten the blade lever. Always unplug the circular saw before adjusting blade depth. If you're having trouble setting the right depth, find a long piece of wood 2 inches (5.1 cm) thick and use it as a guide. Attach a 7 inch (18 cm) diamond blade to a 15-amp circular saw. Attach a pair of vice grips to the edge of the old blade so that it can't move. Use a wrench to remove the center bolt holding the blade in place. Afterward, remove the small rim (also known as the flange) underneath it and take out the old blade. Attach a diamond blade so that the teeth point in the opposite direction of movement.

A garden hose that is set very low is perfect for this. Always wear eye protection when using a circular saw. Using a Cut-Off Saw Mark the cutlines on your concrete using chalk lines or a piece of chalk. For perfectly straight lines, use a chalk line. Gran one end yourself and have a friend hold the other.

In one quick motion, raise the chalk line up about 1 foot (0.30 m) and snap it down so that it hits the ground and applies chalk in a straight line.

Orange, green, and yellow last 2 to 3 weeks, while red and black last around 2 months. Attach a 14 inch (36 cm) wet-cutting diamond blade to a cut-off saw. Fix a pair of vice grips to the side of the old blade to prevent it from spinning. Unscrew the center bolt in the middle of the blade with a wrench. Now, remove the small rim piece (called a flange) underneath and take the old blade out. Attach your diamond blade, taking care that the teeth point in the opposite direction as the cut. Finally, reattach the flange and bolt. Fix a pair of vice grips to the diamond blade if it's moving around while you're reattaching the bolt. Adjust the blade depth of your cut-off saw.
