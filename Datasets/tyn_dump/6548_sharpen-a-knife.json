        "Try to start this motion with the heel of the knife touching the rod and end it with the tip of the knife touching the rod.",
        "In order to master this process, you'll need to move your arm, your hand, and your wrist.",
        "What's especially important to get the right action is moving the wrist.",
        "Without moving the wrist, you won't be able to sweep the entire blade \u2014 heel to tip \u2014 across the honing rod.",
        "Maintaining a 20\u00b0 angle, move the knife across the bottom half of the honing rod.",
        "Using the same sweep of your arm, hand, and wrist, gently move the knife across the lower half of the rod.",
        "Use only as much pressure as the weight of the knife itself.",
        "After completing both a top- and bottom sweep, you've done one revolution.",
        "Do a total of 6 - 8 revolutions with your honing rod before each use of the knife.",
        "Using a Coffee Mug for Quick Results Place an old coffee mug upside down so that the bottom of the mug is exposed to the air.",
        "In a pinch, a coffee mug can serve as a surprisingly effective sharpening tool if you don't have any fancy equipment.",
        "The ceramic material of a mug is a material coarse enough to get good results.",
        "Indeed, some honing rods even use ceramic material to keep a blade homed in between sharpenings.",
        "Maintaining a 20\u00b0 angle, sweep one side of the blade across the grit of the coffee mug several times.",
        "Maintaining a 20\u00b0 angle, repeat the process using the other side of the knife.",
        "Alternate sides of the blade for the final two or three sweeps.",
        "Take one side of the blade and run it across the coffee mug, then turn the blade around and hit the opposite side.",
        "Repeat this pattern several times.",
        "Finish the process with 6 - 8 swipes of your blade across a honing rod.",
        "Smooth out any burrs or kinks in the metal with several swipes on your trusty honing rod."
