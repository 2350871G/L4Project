    "text": " Testing Soil pH with a Commercial Test Probe Dig a small hole in the soil. Use a trowel or spade to dig a hole 2\u20134 inches (5.1\u201310.2 cm) deep. Break up the soil within the hole and remove any twigs or foreign debris. Fill the hole with water. Use distilled (not spring) water. You can find this in your local pharmacy. Rainwater is slightly acidic, and bottled or tap water tends to be slightly alkaline. Fill the hole until you have a muddy pool at the bottom. Insert the test probe into the mud. Make sure your tester is clean and calibrated (for a more exact measurement). Wipe the probe with a tissue or clean cloth, and insert it into the mud. Hold it there for 60 seconds and take a reading. pH is usually measured on a scale of 1-14, though the tester may not include this entire range. A pH of 7 indicates neutral soil. A pH above 7 indicates alkaline soil. A pH below 7 indicates acidic soil. Take several measurements in different spots in the garden.

If one spot is very different than the rest, however, you may need to \"spot treat\" it. Using Paper Test Strips Purchase pH test strips. Test strips, also known as litmus paper, are a quick and easy way to measure the pH of your soil. You can purchase them online or at your local garden store. Mix a handful of soil with room-temperature distilled water. Take a handful of the soil you'd like to test and put it in a bowl. Then, pour some distilled water into the bowl until the dirt is the consistency of a milkshake. You can give the mixture a stir to ensure the water is fully incorporated. Dip a pH test strip in the mixture for 20-30 seconds. Holding your pH test strip at the non-reading end, dip the strip into the dirt mixture for 20-30 seconds. This test time can vary, so consult the directions on your specific test strips to determine the proper dipping time.
