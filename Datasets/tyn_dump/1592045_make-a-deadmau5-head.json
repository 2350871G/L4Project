        "Deadmau5 has big, circular ears - about 13\" (33.02 cm) in diameter.",
        "To replicate these, cut two equally-sized circles from a cardboard box, leaving a small \"tab\" of material on each ear to fit into slots you'll cut to hold the ears in place.",
        "Your ears don't have to be exactly the same size as the ones on the real Mau5head - anything from 12-15\" (30.48-38.1 cm) should be fine.",
        "Fit the ears into slits on the head.",
        "Next, use a knife to cut small, thin slits in the top of your mask's head.",
        "These slits should be just wide enough to accommodate the \"tabs\" on your cardboard ears.",
        "Your slits should be angled toward the back of the head at an  angle of about 15 degrees and the tops of the slits should be about 3.5\" (8.89 cm) apart.",
        "Insert the ears' tabs into these slits and secure with plenty of tape and/or glue.",
        "Finally, papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 the ears to the head.",
        "Add thin layers of papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 to cover the ears, taking special care to add plenty around the ears' tabs to secure them in place.",
        "You may even want to add papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 around the tab inside the mask as well.",
        "Allow to dry overnight.",
        "Cut a Styrofoam ball in half.",
        "Small styrofoam balls, which can be found at most craft stores, are a perfect low-cost solution for making Deadmau5's eyes.",
        "You'll want a styrofoam ball about 4.5\" (11.43 cm) in diameter.",
        "Cut your sphere in half as precisely as possible.",
        "Use a knife, rather than scissors.",
        "Optionally, tape colored lights to the back of your styrofoam eyes.",
        "If you're feeling really artsy, you can tape electric lights to the rear \"flat\" portion of each eye for an awesome effect in low-light conditions.",
        "You may even want to carve a notch in each eye so that your lights can be embedded within the eyes themselves.",
        "When done, your light it should shine through the styrofoam, making the whole eye appear to light up.",
        "Glue your eyes to the head.",
        "The bulging eyes on the Mau5head should sit about 2\" (5.08 cm) above mouth and 5\" (12.7 cm) apart from each other.",
        "If you're not using colored lights for the eyes, you can attach your eyes directly onto the head.",
        "If you are using colored lights, you may need to make small holes in the head to accommodate the lights' wires.",
        "Tape or glue your eyes in place.",
        "If using colored lights, feed any wire(s) through two small holes beneath the eyes.",
        "If your lights are switch-activated, make sure you have easy access to the switch.",
        "For instance, when you wear the Mau5head, you may want to snake the wire down the back of your shirt and into your pocket so you can activate the switch inconspicuously.",
        "Use a thin mesh to cover the inside of the mouth opening.",
        "Stretch a thin fabric mesh (think panty hose material) across the inside of the mouth to form the Mau5head's \"teeth\".",
        "Either hot glue or tape it from the inside to secure it in place.",
        "If the mesh you use isn't already white, paint it a whitish color.",
        "You want as thin and tight of mesh as possible, as you'll look through the mesh to see where you're going when you wear the mask!",
        "Trial-fit the mask.",
        "Once every part of your mask is in place, put on your mask to make sure it's comfy.",
        "Now is your chance to make any last-minute adjustments to make your mask look or feel better.",
        "You may want to ask someone if s/he can see your face.",
        "If you get a \"not really\", \"kinda\", or \"no\", then you're probably fine.",
        "If not, you may want to paint your mesh more thickly or get another layer of see-through fabric to place behind it.",
        "Use caution, however - it's more important that you're able to see than it is that your face is hidden Paint and decorate your mask to your liking.",
        "Congratulations, you Mau5head is done!",
        "All that's left now is to decorate the outside exactly how you want to.",
        "You may want to look up some of the different masks Deadmau5 has actually used over the years for inspiration.",
        "When all else fails, a single, bright color (like candy apple red) always looks great.",
        "Making Use of Alternate Materials Use fabric, rather than paint.",
        "If you're a decent tailor, fabric may be a better choice for the outside of your Mau5head than paint.",
        "Fabric is strong, durable, and looks great.",
        "Even better, though, is the fact that fabric coverings are interchangeable, allowing you to rock several different Deadmau5 looks without having to re-paint your mask!",
        "Use a lamp globe, rather than a papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 sphere.",
        "If you're pressed for time, waiting several days for a papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 mask to dry can be a non-starter.",
        "If you can get your hands on one, you may want to instead use a thin yet sturdy plastic lamp globe as the central \"head\" portion of your mask.",
        "Acrylic plastic lamp globes work well.",
        "Obviously, you'll want one roughly the same size as the mask above (14\" (35.56 cm) in diameter)).",
        "Lamp globes are often available from specialty home furnishers and at some department stores.",
        "Bonus points if it already includes a hole at the bottom that's big enough for your head!",
        "Mount a bike helmet or hard hat inside the mask for added comfort.",
        "Finally, you may find that your Mau5head is more comfortable if you secure a sturdy piece of headgear to the inside of the mask so that you can comfortably \"wear\" the mask on your head.",
        "You can do this with superglue (or, if you're worried about damage to your headgear, lots of tape).",
        "Heavy pieces of headgear, like hard hats, can put stress on the mask when you're not wearing it.",
        "Make sure your mask is strong and rigid enough to support the weight of any headgear you install inside it to keep your mask from imploding!"
