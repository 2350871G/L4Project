Mix, apply, and let cure a two-part stainless steel epoxy according to label instructions. Ceramic sink: Drill any small cracks to create a rough surface. Fill completely with waterproof ceramic putty. Let dry according to label instructions, smoothing it out with a little water just before it dries completely. These repairs may not last forever, but they can last years if properly applied over minor damage."
