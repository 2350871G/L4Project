It should be about 1/3 the size of the heart's body and come about halfway across the top of the heart. This will be the right atrium chamber. The right and left sides of the heart may look switched, but that's because you're drawing the heart from the opposite direction. If you like, draw a line between this bump and the main part of the heart. This line that runs horizontally can represent the tricuspid valve that separates the right atrium and ventricle."
