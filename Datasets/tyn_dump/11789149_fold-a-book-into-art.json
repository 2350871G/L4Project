        "The last thing you want to do is deviate from your outline or tear a page and ruin all of your hard work!",
        "Stand the book upright to show off your completed design.",
        "When you\u2019ve finished folding your final page (whew!",
        "), all that\u2019s left to do is put the fruits of your labor on display.",
        "Just prop the book up on its bottom surface and open it up.",
        "Adjust the angle formed by the front and back covers and the spacing of the pages as needed to make your design easier to see.If you used a softcover book and are having a hard time getting it to stay standing, cut a couple pieces of cardboard to the same height and width as the book and insert them behind the front and back covers to lend some extra support.",
        "Embellish your book with decorative paper items to impress even more.",
        "If you want to add a little extra flair to your homespun book art, take some time to fold a few origami accents and arrange them around the upper part of the folded pages where they slant towards your design.",
        "They'll lend an element of wonder and whimsy while also filling up blank space and giving the eye more to settle on.",
        "Flowers, snowflakes, pinwheels, animals, and miniature paper airplanes can all make quaint book ornaments.",
        "If the idea of origami isn't very appealing after all the folding you've been doing, another option is to simply adorn your book with small fabric ribbons or bows, or even found natural items like dried flowers or colorful gemstones."
