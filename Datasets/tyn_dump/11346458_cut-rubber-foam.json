Pin the foam down to create accurate cutting guidelines, but don\u2019t forget to hold it while you\u2019re cutting it as well. If you\u2019re unable to hold onto a big piece of foam, you could try setting up a few bar clamps to pin it to your work surface.

        "After scoring the entire part you wish to cut, go back to the beginning.",
        "Begin cutting it a second time along the initial score you made.",
        "It will allow you to cut a little deeper.",
        "If the foam is very thin, you may not need to go back over it more than 2 or 3 times.",
        "For thicker pieces of foam, you definitely will need to go back over the initial cut multiple times.",
        "It takes a while and leads to a messy piece of foam, so you\u2019re better off using a larger blade.",
        "Slicing Thicker Foam with a Serrated Blade Select a thin, sharp blade for foam up to 4 in (10 cm) thick.",
        "Utility knives don\u2019t work very well for relatively thick pieces of foam.",
        "Instead, choose the best kitchen knife you have available.",
        "Since cutting foam is a lot like cutting bread, many people go with a nice serrated bread knife.",
        "Carving knives also tend to work well.",
        "Rubber foam has a similar consistency to bread, so your best bet is to pick a serrated blade that is easy to control.",
        "It has to be sharp in order to cut smoothly through the foam.",
        "If you have an electric carving knife, it\u2019s one of the easiest ways to cut foam.",
        "Turn it on and let it saw through the foam on its own.",
        "Hold the knife flat against the top of the foam if you\u2019re cutting through it.",
        "There are a couple of ways to cut rubber foam, but the simplest way is to approach it from the top.",
        "This strategy is very easy to complete if your knife is long enough to cut through the entire piece of foam in a single stroke.",
        "Keep the knife parallel to the foam at the edge of the cutting guideline.",
        "If you\u2019re working on a very long piece of foam, you may be better off cutting at a perpendicular angle instead.",
        "This allows you to saw through the foam at a more gradual but accurate pace.",
        "Slice through the foam to complete the cut.",
        "Stand beside the foam so you are able to draw the knife down its entire length.",
        "To make the cut, push the knife in as you draw it back toward you.",
        "Make sure it goes all the way through the foam.",
        "Move slowly, pulling the knife back with light strokes until you\u2019re finished.",
        "Don\u2019t rush to complete the cut in a single stroke.",
        "Draw the knife back, stop to readjust your grip, and then continue.",
        "Smoother strokes lead to a smoother finish.",
        "Align the knife at a 90-degree angle if you\u2019re cutting curves.",
        "Hold the blade vertically against the edge of the foam.",
        "This strategy lets you saw through the side of the foam instead of slicing it like a loaf of bread.",
        "It\u2019s perfect when you need more control over the blade.",
        "It\u2019s also useful for thick pieces of foam that can\u2019t easily be cut from top to bottom.",
        "If you\u2019re using this strategy, position the foam so it overhangs the table.",
        "The overhanging portion gives you some room to start the cut, but make sure the foam doesn\u2019t stretch out at all.",
        "Saw through the foam to finish the cut.",
        "Starting at the end of the foam, move the blade back and forth.",
        "If you\u2019re using an electric carving knife, the blade will move on its own, so all you have to do is pull it along the cutting guideline.",
        "Take your time, ensuring the knife stays centered on the line you wish to cut.",
        "For the best effect, use the middle part of the blade to cut the foam.",
        "It is typically sharper and leads to a more even cut.",
        "Sawing the foam takes a little more patience than cutting straight through it.",
        "When done correctly, however, you won\u2019t need to cut more than once.",
        "Cutting Foam with a Bandsaw Wear safety gear when cutting foam with a saw.",
        "Always put on a dust mask and protective glasses when operating a saw.",
        "Avoid wearing gloves, long-sleeved clothing, jewelry, or anything else that could get caught under the blade.",
        "Also, keep other people away from the area until you\u2019re finished working.",
        "To reduce the amount of mess left over, consider working outdoors or ventilating your workspace.",
        "Ventilate by opening nearby doors and windows as well as making use of a ventilation fan if you have one.",
        "Set up a bandsaw according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.",
        "Put the bandsaw on a stable surface at about waist height.",
        "Make sure you have plenty of room for the rubber foam as well.",
        "Use the fasteners included with the saw to clamp it to the surface.",
        "When you\u2019re ready, plug it in and wait for the blade to begin spinning.",
        "Bandsaws are designed to cut a wide variety of materials, so they work well for foam.",
        "The serrated blades used make small but accurate cuts.",
        "You may not get the same result if you try using another type of saw.",
        "If you have a foam cutting saw available, it is a better option than a bandsaw.",
        "However, they cost up to $400 USD, so they aren\u2019t practical unless you cut a lot of foam.",
        "Push the foam onto the blade to begin cutting it.",
        "Hold the foam steady with both of your hands.",
        "Move it forward slowly, keeping the blade aligned with any cutting guidelines you drew.",
        "Watch where your hands are at as you get closer to the blade.",
        "You can go as slowly as you want when operating the saw.",
        "Just  don\u2019t move the foam faster than the blade cuts through it.",
        "Maintain a steady pace.",
        "If you\u2019re using a foam cutting saw, you have to move the saw along the foam instead of the other way around.",
        "It\u2019s similar to sawing through it with a knife.",
        "Saws are the quickest and cleanest way to cut through foam, but be careful to avoid accidents.",
        "Turn off the saw once you\u2019re done cutting the foam.",
        "Keep pushing the foam toward the saw until you have managed to cut all the way through it.",
        "Before shutting down the saw, check it to make sure it looks the way you want.",
        "You can cut the piece if you need to remove excess foam.",
        "When you\u2019re done, remember to turn off the saw and unplug it to prevent accidents.",
        "Always shut off the saw when it isn\u2019t in use.",
        "This includes unplugging it so it has no way of reactivating when you\u2019re not controlling it."
