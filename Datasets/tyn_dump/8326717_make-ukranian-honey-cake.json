If you find that the dough is sticking to the rolling pin, sprinkle the top of dough lightly with flour. Use a plate to trace perfect circles for each piece and save scraps.

Be sure to save the dough scraps. Instead of a plate, you can use the bottom insert from a 9-inch (23-cm) springform pan. Baking the Dough Line a cookie sheet and transfer the dough. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper to keep the cake layers from sticking. Place one or two cake layers on the cookie sheet, depending on how many will fit.

If you don\u2019t plan to assemble the cake right away, refrigerate the frosting until you\u2019re ready. Assembling the Cake Spread some of the frosting on first layer of cake.
