So, avoid using any thick or leathery leaves in your compost, including holly, magnolia, oak, birch, and beech. Also avoid leaves which can inhibit the growth of other plants (e.g., hackberry leaves). Oak leaves take longer to decompose than many other types of leaves. If you find that oak leaves comprise the majority of your compost pile, shred them more thoroughly than the other types of leaves to make sure they compost well.

        "Although grass clippings or grass mulch are the most accessible sources of nitrogen for many people, others may not have access to grass.",
        "In this situation, the next best option is to use manure.",
        "As with the grass clippings, add manure to your leaf pile at a 1:5 ratio.",
        "So, if you have 5 wheelbarrow loads of leaves, add in 1 wheelbarrow of manure.",
        "Purchase manure at any large landscaping or gardening-supply store.",
        "Or, if you live near a livestock farm or ranch, talk to the owners.",
        "They\u2019ll probably be more than happy to let you cart off some of their manure.",
        "Throw kitchen scraps into your compost pile to add richness.",
        "As the grass clippings and leaves decay, you can begin adding more organic material to the pile.",
        "For example, toss a handful of vegetable peels and coffee grounds into the leaf pile once a week.",
        "Make sure to mix the new organic material in with a pitchfork so it doesn\u2019t remain on top.",
        "Avoid adding dairy products, dense breads, or meats to your compost pile.",
        "Situating the Compost Bin Set up a chain link wire fence section that\u2019s 3 ft (0.91 m) across.",
        "The compost pile needs to be contained within a single space, and chain link wire fencing is the ideal material to use.",
        "It will let air circulate through the composting leaves and hold the leaves closely together so that they'll stay damp and compost relatively quickly.",
        "Fill the chain bin with the ground leaves and grass bits.",
        "If you don\u2019t have access to chain link fencing material, you can also use wooden slats, like those on a shipping crate.",
        "Nail the slats together into a 3 ft \u00d7 3 ft (0.91 m \u00d7 0.91 m) square.",
        "Either material will allow oxygen to get to your compost.",
        "Locate the compost pile on a well-draining patch of ground.",
        "If the inside of the leaf compost pile stays too wet, it may turn to mush and the compost will be ruined.",
        "So, situate the compost pile on well-draining soil so that excess moisture in the compost will drain into the ground.",
        "Before deciding on a location for the pile, make sure it won\u2019t be in an area that\u2019s prone to developing puddles of standing water.",
        "Never locate a compost pile on concrete, cement, or asphalt.",
        "Situate the compost pile in a shaded area to reduce moisture loss.",
        "If your compost pile is exposed to direct sunlight for more than 3\u20134 hours a day, much-needed moisture will evaporate from the leaves and organic matter.",
        "So, locate the pile in a location that will receive partial sun to help the compost keep its moisture.",
        "For example, this could be behind a large tree or 1 wall of a backyard shed.",
        "When you first start the pile, it will be loose and prone to blowing around the yard.",
        "If high winds are a concern in your area, place the compost pile in an area where it will not blow away.",
        "Plan to cover the compost pile with a plastic tarp, if you cannot construct a container.",
        "Turning and Using Your Compost Keep the pile moist by sprinkling it with a hose once a week.",
        "During dry weather, water your compost pile with a garden hose to keep the inside moist.",
        "Avoid creating standing pools of water.",
        "The compost should be damp enough that when you can pick up a handful of compost and squeeze, only a few drops of water drip out.",
        "If you\u2019re in the middle of a rainy spell, you may not need to water the compost pile for 3\u20134 weeks at a time.",
        "Check it every few days to make sure it hasn\u2019t dried out.",
        "Turn your compost every 2 weeks with a shovel or a pitchfork.",
        "Dig the tip of the pitchfork or shovel into the bottom of the pile of compost and turn clockwise to mix the compost.",
        "Continue mixing until the whole pile has been turned through.",
        "The top layer should be buried and the leaf compost should look fresh and wet on the top.",
        "Turning the compost pile allows the leaves to decompose uniformly and keeps a good mixture of oxygen throughout the pile.",
        "The heat that forms inside the moist pile of leaves and clippings is often called \u201ccooking.\u201d Add the finished compost to your garden soil after 4 to 9 months.",
        "When the material has finished composting and is ready to use, it will have a rich, earthy smell, and should feel thick and crumbly.",
        "You should no longer be able to pick out single leaves or grass blades.",
        "To use the compost, deposit a 3\u20134 in (7.6\u201310.2 cm) layer on top of the soil in your garden or flower pots.",
        "Mix the compost in to the garden topsoil with your fingers.",
        "Although compost is a great way to increase the organic content of soil, it doesn\u2019t quite have the same nutritional value as a store-bought fertilizer."
