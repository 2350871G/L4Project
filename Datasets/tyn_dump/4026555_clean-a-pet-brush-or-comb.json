Lancy Woo\t\t\tCertified Pet Groomer\t\t\t\tWhat Our Expert Does: At the end of each grooming session, I dip all my tools, combs, and brushes in Barbicide for 10 minutes, then wipe off the solution when it's done. It's the same product human hair salons use, although pet supply stores have their own versions. When that's done, I add a misting of alcohol or hydrogen peroxide, then dry it all thoroughly."

                    "description": "Once you\u2019ve removed excess hair and dirt, you should submerge your grooming instruments in the cleaning solution for between five and thirty minutes. This step is important even if you\u2019re planning to disinfect with bleach or an antibacterial spray. After all, most disinfectants\u2014including bleach\u2014don\u2019t remove dirt or grime, so you can\u2019t just substitute one for the other. Pet brushes and combs are generally made of plastic, but if you own one with a fabric pad, don\u2019t soak the entire head of the brush. If you do, moisture can accumulate in the fabric and eventually cause mold."
