If you don\u2019t have a dehydrator, put the corn in an oven set to 175 \u00b0F (79 \u00b0C). Leave the oven door open so the moisture is able to escape. The corn will dry out in about 8 to 10 hours. Another option, if you have fresh corn on the cob, is to hang the cobs in a cool, dry place for 3 to 4 weeks."
