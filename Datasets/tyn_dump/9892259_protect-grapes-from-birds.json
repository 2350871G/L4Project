    "text": " Covering Bunches with Bags Put the bags on the grape bunches when they change colors. Birds generally aren't attracted to grape bunches until they start maturing. When the grapes start to mature and change colors, bag them as soon as you can. Cut 2 inches (5.1 cm) slits in a paper bag. Take a pair of scissors and make 2 2 inches (5.1 cm) slits on either side of the bag. Follow the center seam of the bag as a guide for where to make the slit. The slits are where the grapevines will poke through the bag. Pinch off any leaves directly around the grape clusters. Leaves need direct sunlight and will wilt if left in the paper bag. Pinch or cut away any leaves that the paper bag would cover once you bag the grapes. Although leaves cannot grow in the paper bag, your grapes can grow without wilting. They may, however, mature slowly. Slide a bag over the grape bunches. Position the bunches so the vines rest near the side slits.

Organza bags are translucent fabric drawstring bags, and they are available online or at most craft stores. If you use organza bags, you do not have to pinch of any leaves. Wrapping Netting or Tulle Around Vines Add bird netting or tulle when the grapes change color. Grapes will become appealing to birds as they ripen.
