Remove any items that you may need from your car. You will have to keep your car doors and windows closed throughout the baking process. Ensure that the car is parked somewhere clean and away from the exhaust of other cars that are running. Take your air freshener out of the car first. It might contaminate the cookies, and you won't need one afterwards when your car smells like fresh baked cookies. Preparing the cookies Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. You could use a sprayed surface but beware that this could cause the cookies to spread. Prepare the cookie dough if needed. Do either of the following:\nCut a log of pre-made cookie dough into even rounds. Place the rounds onto the cookie sheet, leaving about 1\u00bd\" (4cm) of space around each cookie. If you haven't purchased pre-made cookie dough, make the dough from this recipe (as was done for this article) or use your own cookie recipe (preferably egg-free, to avoid any potential for problems of not baking the egg sufficiently). Arrange each cookie on the baking sheet, adding blobs about tablespoon wide and leaving some space around the cookies to allow for spread.

Cover the cookies with plastic-wrap if not baking immediately and keep in the refrigerator until needed. Don't make the dough too far ahead of use though, use within a few hours. Baking the cookies on the dashboard Place the cookies on the baking sheet into the car. Gently push into place on the dashboard. Place a thermometer next to the cookie sheet on the dashboard. You want to make sure that your car temperature reaches at least 165 \u00b0F (70 \u00b0C) to kill any germs that were present in any raw ingredients. Shut the doors and let the sun begin the baking.
