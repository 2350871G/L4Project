Look to see if your keg has a CO2 line. Some kegs will have a CO2 tank that provides pressure inside the keg to help dispense beer. The gas also helps the beer hold its natural carbonation. If the system you're using has a CO2 line, turn it off. Lift the coupler handle at the base of the tap where it joins the keg. Grasp the coupler and rotate it counter-clockwise until it won't move anymore, usually just a half-turn. Pull the coupler off the empty keg.  Move the empty keg aside.
