    "text": " Making the Lamp With Drilling Select a vase. You want a vase large enough to allow you to work with, but also stable enough to support the fixtures you are about to add. The overall vase size is up to you and depends on the location you want to place it. You may add an additional base. The standard lamp kit has dimensions of 8.75\u201d tall x 1.75\u201d deep x 5.75\u201d wide. So keep this in mind when selecting your vase. If your vase has a wider opening this will be addressed later. If it is too narrow then you will need to choose a different vase. Add a base. Use a ruler or tape measure to calculate and mark the center of the base. Do the same for the vase. This is something to consider in conjunction with stability of the vase and planning for the power cord. The base needs to be larger than the bottom of the vase in square area for stability. You want a base that will allow for the power cord to exit out the bottom center or side. Drill a hole in the bottom of the vase. Use a 3/8\u2033 drill bit and power drill. Drill into point where you marked the center of the vase\u2019s bottom. Drill from outside to inside. Clear out excess materials so they don\u2019t create a hazard later. Apply the adapter to the vase. Use the pipe kit portion of the Westinghouse kit. Choose the rubber adapter that will fit into the vase opening, but don\u2019t put it into the vase yet. If none of the kit\u2019s adapters are wide enough for your vase you can look for other adapters at a lighting or hardware store. Insert the lamp\u2019s nipple into the adapter. Do this so that 1\u20444\u201d extends beyond the rubber adapter. Put the locknut onto the opposite end of nipple and tighten it. Insert the whole adapter and nipple setup into the vase so that the 1\u20444\u201d nipple portion is protruding upward. Slide the kit\u2019s check ring and harp bottom over the nipple. Place the socket cap onto the nipple and tighten it. Slip wire through the sleeve in the socket cap. Tie this wire into an overhand knot with two free ends within the cap. Connect the wire to the neutral conductor. Look for the ribbing or raised portion on the insulation. Connect one end of the free end of the knotted wire to the silver-colored terminal screw on one side. Connect the other free end of the knotted wire to the brass-colored terminal screw on the other side. Hold the wires partially hooked under each screw head while you tighten both terminal screws to make sure both ends of the conducting wires remain under the screw heads. Try getting one screw started enough to hold the first wire, and then start on the second one. Get the second screw turned enough to pinch the wire down.

Pull the extra wire sticking out of the socket back into the lamp and snap the brass shell onto the socket cap. Rock the shell back and forth if necessary. Listen for a clicking sound to signal the shell is locked onto the cap. Attach the lamp harp. This will be what fits the shade on top. Slide the harp\u2019s two prongs onto the harp saddle. A harp could be 10.5\" x 0.13\" x 4.25\" Add the light bulb. Turn the bulb just enough so it starts to tighten, but don\u2019t over-tighten. Don\u2019t plug in the lamp just yet or you might blind yourself. This design is meant for up to 150 watts. Add a lamp shade. The style of shade is up to you. The harp should come with a fastener (finial) on top to fit a hole on top of shades configured for it. Make sure the shade is not too narrow or short for the harp or vase. Making the Lamp Without Drilling Select a suitable vase. Pick a vase that will give you room to maneuver with your hands. As with the drilling method you still need one that will fit the average sized lamp fixtures you might have in mind. Don\u2019t pick a vase that will be too top-heavy. If you add a base remember to add one that will allow for the power cord to pass through the center and then bottom or side. Place the hex nut onto the threaded lamp nipple. You\u2019ll be using the 3/8-inch hex nut and IP threaded nipple. Twist the hex nut onto the nipple. Make sure the nipple\u2019s end is flush with the edge of the hex nut. Put the flat washer over the other end of the nipple. Allow the nipple to rest against the hex nut. Do not let the nipple protrude past the hex nut. Slide the nipple through the center hole of one of the rubber adapters. Pick a lamp adapter that will fit the top opening of the vase. Twist one of the knurled locknuts onto the nipple. Do this above the adapter. Tighten the locknut until it\u2019s flush against the lamp adapter. Place one of the IP interior threaded couplings onto the nipple. Twist it on above the knurled locknut. Make sure the coupling is flush against the locknut. Screw on the brass IP threaded-end lamp pipe. Make sure the lamp pipe is twisted into the coupling. Also ensure the lamp pipe is at minimum 2\u201d longer than the overall height of the vase. Screw another knurled locknut onto the top threads of the lamp pipe. Do this until it reaches the bottom of the threads. Insert the end of the lamp pipe through the center hole in a lamp harp saddle. Fasten a side-outlet style lamp socket cap onto the lamp pipe. Put this on above the saddle. Find the tiny set screw on the neck of the cap. Tighten the set screw to stabilize the cap. Thread the lamp cord. Pull the ends of the cord upward through the rubber gasket preinstalled in the bottom of the socket cap. Grab the two lamp cord wires from the socket cap with your fingers, and separate about three inches of cord by pulling the grabbed wires apart. You can do this because these lamp cords should have thin insulation holding the two wires together that are pre-designed to allow separation. Ask the purchasing shop if you have questions about this kind of electrical cord. Tie the wires in an overhand knot within the cap. Wrap one free end of one lamp cord wire around one screw on the interior lamp socket. Wrap the other free end of the wire around the interior lamp socket\u2019s other screw. Tighten both screws to keep both wire leads under the screw heads. Get one screw partially started so it is holding one wire in place before you start the second screw. Get the second screw turned enough to hold the second wire in place. Finish tightening both terminal screws. Place the brass socket cover over the interior socket and into the cap. Use your hand to push the cover back and forth until it snaps into place. Listen for a \u201cclick\u201d to let you know it\u2019s in place. Place the lamp harp on the harp saddle. Fix the two ends of the harp onto the saddle by sliding them into place. Make sure the harp isn\u2019t too wide for the vase opening near the bottom. Place in a light bulb. Screw the bulb into the lamp socket. Turn the bulb until it\u2019s just starting to tighten. Don\u2019t over-tighten it. Remember not to screw the bulb in while the lamp is on or you\u2019ll blind yourself. Put a lampshade on the harp. The lampshade design is your choice. The harp should have come with a finial. Use the finial to secure the lampshade to the harp. Make sure the lampshade is configured to work with both the harp and fastener.",
