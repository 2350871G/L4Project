Submerge the pants you want to stretch in the water and let them soak for at least 1 hour before you attempt to stretch them.Tip: If you don\u2019t have baby shampoo, you can substitute 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of conditioner. If you have neither, just soak the pants in plain water. This will loosen the cotton fibers so that they are easier to stretch.
