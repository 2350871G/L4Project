        "Set the shot glasses on a plate or baking sheet to catch any accidental spills.",
        "Place the shot glasses back in the refrigerator for 30 to 40 minutes.",
        "Let the final layer set before you enjoy your jello shots.",
        "If you aren\u2019t eating them right away, keep them in the refrigerator until you\u2019re ready to serve them.",
        "Top each shot with 1 to 2 pieces of actual candy corn for an extra sweet touch.",
        "Refrigerated jello shots will last 7 to 10 days.",
        "Preparing Virgin Jello Shots Combine the box of lemon gelatin with 1 packet of unflavored gelatin.",
        "Pour both gelatin powders into a small bowl.",
        "Use a spoon to mix them together.",
        "If you\u2019re using a bulk container of unflavored gelatin, 1 packet is equal to about 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of gelatin.",
        "Stir 1 cup (240 ml) of boiling water into the gelatin mix.",
        "Carefully pour the water into the bowl with the gelatin powders.",
        "Stir the ingredients together with a spoon until the powder is completely dissolved.",
        "It will take about 2 minutes.",
        "Lukewarm water will not work.",
        "You need hot water that will dissolve the powder.",
        "Anything cooler will just cause the powder to clump up.",
        "You can either bring the water to a boil on the stove or heat it in the microwave.",
        "Fill each of the shot glasses halfway with the gelatin mixture.",
        "Use a funnel or a measuring cup to pour the liquid into each shot glass.",
        "Leave room in the glass for the second layer.",
        "A tablespoon or eyedropper can also help you get the liquid into the shot glasses without a mess.",
        "Place the shot glasses in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.",
        "This will allow the lemon gelatin to harden before you add the orange layer.",
        "After 20 minutes, the gelatin should be firm and jiggly to the touch.",
        "If you don\u2019t let the lemon layer set properly, the 2 layers will mix together instead of sitting separately on top of each other.",
        "Combine the orange gelatin, unflavored gelatin, and boiling water.",
        "Now you\u2019re making the orange layer.",
        "Mix the box of orange-flavored gelatin, the other packet of unflavored gelatin, and 1 cup (240 ml) of boiling water in a small bowl.",
        "Stir until the powder is dissolved.",
        "Use a new bowl or simply rinse out the one you had used for the lemon layer.",
        "Do this step while the lemon gelatin is setting in the refrigerator to save time.",
        "Wait to mix it until 5 to 10 minutes before it's time to remove the lemon gelatin, though, so it doesn't start setting.",
        "Pour the orange mixture on top of the lemon layer in each shot glass.",
        "Now that the lemon layer has set in the fridge, you can add the orange layer.",
        "With a measuring cup or funnel, fill the remaining half of each shot glass with the orange gelatin mixture.",
        "Test 1 shot glass before pouring it into all of them.",
        "If the layers begin mixing, you know you need to let the first layer harden a little more first.",
        "Place the filled shot glasses back in the fridge for another 20 minutes.",
        "This allows the orange layer to set just like the lemon layer did.",
        "If you aren't planning to eat the shots immediately, keep them in the fridge until serving.",
        "There's no harm in leaving the shots in the fridge for longer than 20 to 30 minutes to set.",
        "It's better to have them firmer than too runny.",
        "You can keep jello shots in the fridge for 7 to 10 days.",
        "Add whipped topping and some sprinkles before serving if you\u2019d like.",
        "For a little festive flair, spoon a dollop of whipped topping onto the shot glasses to mimic the white layer of a candy corn.",
        "Toss on some orange and white sprinkles, too.",
        "Wait until you\u2019re ready to eat the shots before you add the final touches.",
        "Otherwise, the whipped topping will melt or fall flat.",
