        "About half of all states require the name to end with a corporate designator, such as Corporation (Corp.), Incorporated (Inc.) or Limited (Ltd.).",
        "Your name cannot contain certain designations reserved for the state, such as United States, Reserve, Federal, National, Cooperative or Bank.",
        "Apply for the name that you've chosen.",
        "Take the following steps:\nVisit your state's filing office website or call your state's corporations division.",
        "Ask to see if the name is available or if it is already taken.",
        "If the name is available, then you can usually pay a small fee that will reserve the name for you until you've filed your Articles of Incorporation.",
        "If the name is taken, then create another name.",
        "Formulate your mission statement.",
        "As a nonprofit organization, you exist to accomplish your mission based upon your purpose, services and values.",
        "The mission statement is a concise expression that covers in one or two sentences the name of the organization, what it does, for whom it performs services and where it dispenses service.",
        "It should also portray how your organization is distinct from others like it.",
        "Make your mission statement compelling.",
        "It will be used in all published materials, funding requests and public relations handouts.",
        "Use some of these mission statements as examples:\n\"The mission of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital is to advance cures, and means of prevention, for pediatric catastrophic diseases through research and treatment.\"",

        "Nonprofits help serve people, and that really does help make the world a better place!",
        "Hire an attorney.",
        "Your attorney will help you with your Articles of Incorporation and the bylaws.",
        "Hire someone with 501(c)(3) experience to help you file your state and federal exemption forms.",
        "You'll save both time and money in the long run.",
        "Most paralegals and attorneys have little experience with nonprofits.",
        "You can usually check out these services via the state bar association, references from fellow nonprofit owners or the Better Business Bureau.",
        "Filing Documents File Articles of Incorporation.",
        "Articles of Incorporation are official statements that you are creating an organization, and they are filed with a state's corporations office.",
        "Articles of Incorporation protect both board and staff from legal liabilities incurred by the organization, making the corporation the holder of debts and liabilities instead of placing responsibility with the individuals and officers who work for the organization.",
        "The specific requirements governing how to incorporate are determined by each state.",
        "You can obtain the information you need to proceed with this step from your state Attorney General\u2019s office or your Secretary of State's office.",
        "These official documents may have different names in different states.",

        "Apply for a federal employer identification number.",
        "Regardless of whether or not you have employees, nonprofits are required to obtain a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN), which is also referred to as the federal ID number.",
        "This number is used to identify the organization when tax documents are filed and is used not unlike an individual\u2019s Social Security number.",
        "If you received your number prior to incorporation, you will need to apply for a new number under the corporate name.",
        "Ask for Form SS-4 when applying for your EIN.",

        "Make sure that you feel comfortable with the person.",
        "The person should be reliable, should listen to your concerns and should respond to requests as soon as possible.",
        "Choose a firm that matches the size of your nonprofit.",
        "If you're a small 501c3, then choose a CPA who works alone or a small firm.",
        "For large nonprofits, choose a large firm with a good reputation.",
        "Take time to make your choice.",
        "Look for referrals and references and interview different candidates so that you make the best choice from a pool of available accountants.",

        "Develop a record-keeping system.",
        "Legally, you must save all Board documents including minutes and financial statements.",
        "You'll have to preserve your important corporate documents, including board meeting minutes, bylaws, Articles of Incorporation, financial reports and other official records.",
        "You should contact your appropriate state agency for more information on what records you are required to keep in the official files.",
        "Develop an accounting system in partnership with your CPA.",
        "Nonprofits are accountable to the public, their funders (contributors), and, in some instances, government granting bodies.",
        "You have to establish a system of controls (checks and balances) when establishing the organization\u2019s accounting practices.",
        "Make sure that your system meets both your current and your anticipated future needs.",
        "The organization needs to open a bank account and decide whether to use the accrual or cash method of accounting.",
        "The difference between the two types of accounting is when revenues and expenses are recorded.",
        "In cash basis accounting, revenues are recorded when cash is actually received and expenses are recorded when they are actually paid (no matter when they were actually invoiced).",
        "In accrual basis accounting, income is reported in the fiscal period it is earned, regardless of when it is received, and expenses are deducted in the fiscal period they are incurred, whether they are paid or not.",
        "Applying for Tax Exempt Status Apply for recognition of tax-exempt public charity status.",
        "You'll need to fill out either Form 1023 or 1024, which is an application.",

        "Submit financial statements for the current year as well as budgets for the next 2 years in Part XI of Form 1023.",
        "If an attorney is representing you, fill out Form 2848 to designate power of attorney.",
        "Either can be obtained from your local IRS office or the IRS website.",
        "The filing fee will depend upon the size of your organization\u2019s budget.",
        "This application is an important legal document, so seek the assistance of an experienced attorney or certified public accountant (CPA) when preparing it.",

        "Attn: Extracting Stop 312\nCovington, KY 41011 Ask the IRS to expedite your application if you can.",
        "The IRS usually considers applications in the order in which they are received.",
        "They may be willing to expedite your application if you have a pending grant that is necessary for continued operation, if your newly created organization is providing relief to disaster victims or if IRS delays have caused significant problems with the release of a determination letter.",

        "Bylaws are simply the \"rules\" of how the organization operates.",

        "Bylaws should be drafted with the help of an attorney and approved by the board early in the organization's development.",
        "Depending on who you use to assist in the process, some firms require that your bylaws are sent to the IRS.",
        "Form a Board of Directors.",
        "Forming a board requires careful thought and extensive recruitment efforts.",
        "Each state has regulations that determine the minimum size of the board, which is typically 3, 5 or 7, but the optimum number of people who sit on the board should be determined by the needs of the organization.",
        "Based on what your organization would like to accomplish, you should decide what special skills and qualities you will require of the individuals on your board.",
        "Identify qualified individuals who are supportive of your mission and are willing to give of their talents and time.",
        "Include the community at large, not just your specific community of focus (e.g.",
        "the mental health community).",
        "Consider the religious community, local service clubs, legal professionals and colleges and universities as sources for a prospective Board of Directors.",
