Make sure you have a calibrated burette, a burette stand, multiple beakers and/or Erlenmeyer flasks, a measured amount of your analyte, and a large quantity of your titrant before you begin. While a magnetic stir plate isn\u2019t required, it can be very useful. Your analyte is the sample in which you are looking for a specific chemical quantity. That chemical is your titrand. For example, if you are checking the chloride levels in your local water supply, tap water would be your analyte, and the chlorides would be your titrand. Your titrant is the chemical that you add to your analyte in measured quantities to help you calculate the amount of your titrand. You want enough of your titrant that you can repeat your titration at least 3 times. If you are unsure of how much of your titrant you need, you can look online or consult your lab\u2019s director."

Pour it in until you reach the zero point on the burette using a graduated cylinder or a small flask or beaker. If you overfill your burette, open the stopcock slightly and let the excess titrant flow out until it reaches the zero mark. Clamp the burette carefully to a burette stand. The burette should be secure enough so that it does not move or slide. Tighten the clamp slowly, though, to avoid cracking or breaking the burette.

With the burette in the stand, carefully tap it with your index finger in order to remove any gas bubbles inside the liquid.
