Use a box cutter to cut a 6 in \u00d7 6 in (15 cm \u00d7 15 cm) window into the top of your existing wall. Use other cardboard pieces to make your fort into the ultimate Nerf hideout!For example, you can cut out sections 3 in (7.6 cm) wide and 2\u20134 in (5.1\u201310.2 cm) deep to make the outside of your structure look like a castle. Grab a large piece of cardboard about 3\u20134 ft (0.91\u20131.22 m) long, and poke 2 holes in the corners. Attach some rope to either corner, and feed the rope through the front of the cardboard, and attach the cardboard to the base of your fort. This creates your own drawbridge! When using a box cutter, be extremely careful to avoid cutting yourself. Ask an adult to help you if you need."

        "Once you create your basic foundation, place additional boxes on top of the first ones to build your walls.",
        "Your fort can be as tall as you\u2019d like, though a height of at least 4\u20135 ft (1.2\u20131.5 m) is great for basic protection.",
        "If you have a row of 5 medium boxes in a line, place another 2-3 medium boxes on top of the existing ones to create the wall.",
        "Cut boxes into your desired shape and size to make unique additions.",
        "While this is optional, you can use a flat, large or extra large box to customize your fort.",

        "Use a box cutter to cut a 6 in \u00d7 6 in (15 cm \u00d7 15 cm) window into the top of your existing wall.",
        "Use other cardboard pieces to make your fort into the ultimate Nerf hideout!For example, you can cut out sections 3 in (7.6 cm) wide and 2\u20134 in (5.1\u201310.2 cm) deep to make the outside of your structure look like a castle.",
        "Grab a large piece of cardboard about 3\u20134 ft (0.91\u20131.22 m) long, and poke 2 holes in the corners.",
        "Attach some rope to either corner, and feed the rope through the front of the cardboard, and attach the cardboard to the base of your fort.",

        "Ask an adult to help you if you need.",
        "Tape the loose pieces of cardboard together so they stay in place.",
        "To prevent your Nerf fort from toppling over during an ambush, use some duct tape for reinforcement.",
        "After you assemble your fort to your liking, rip 4\u20136 in (10\u201315 cm)  pieces of duct tape, and place them halfway on 1 box and halfway on the other.",
        "Do this for every spot where the boxes intersect, for instance.Another way of reinforcing your fort is adding heavy objects to the bottoms of the cardboard so it'll stay on the ground.",
        "This is especially helpful if you are using this fort outside, so it doesn't get blown away by the wind or toppled over by people.Add more or less tape, based on how secure you want your fort to be.",
        "Using Pillows, Blankets, and Furniture Designate a spot in your house to build the fort.",
        "When using pillows and blankets to build a fort, pick a spot in your bedroom, living room, or basement.",

        "Rearrange furniture to make more space to craft your fort.",
        "What furniture to move and where to move it depends on your room and availability, so use your creativity!",
        "For instance, you may want to scoot the couch over so you have more room for your fort.",
        "Or, you may want to move the couch to act as your main wall against attackers.",
        "Examine your space and choose items to move in order to enhance your fort.Avoid moving your bed, entertainment unit, or heavy bookshelf, as these items are likely hard to move.",
        "Be sure you move the furniture back to its proper spot when you are finished playing.",
        "Lay down a few blankets to create your floor.",
        "After you rearrange some furniture and choose your space, it\u2019s time to start building.",
        "Grab a few blankets, sheets, or towels to create your floor space.",
        "Do this in a corner spot, for instance.",
        "Stretch the blankets out so they lay flat, and stack a few to make the space more comfortable.This way, you have a cozy spot to hide from the enemy team.",
        "Stack pillows to create a barrier wall.",
        "You can use pillows from your bed or couch cushions from your sofa to create a large wall for protection.",
        "Stack 3-5 pillows on top of each other around the blanket space you created.",

        "Make a ceiling by draping a blanket over top your area.",
        "Use a sheet, thin blanket, or comforter to create a covering for your fort.",
        "For example, you can position 2 chairs on either side of your fort and drape a blanket over top of them.",
        "Or, try tucking the blanket around your pillow stacks to keep it in place for an easy alternative.",
        "Creating a ceiling keeps you hidden from the opposing team.",
        "Use your imagination to create whatever kind of fort you\u2019d like!",
        "After you have the basic formation of your fort, look around your room to see what else you can use.",
        "Grab a blanket to drape over the top for extra security, or stack some stools in front for reinforcement.",
        "Since this is your own custom Nerf fort, make it however you\u2019d like.Consider creating a Nerf gun station on the inside of your fort with all of your guns and extra Nerf bullets.",
        "This way, you\u2019ll be ready to attack!",
        "Creating a Hideout with Fort Boards Purchase fort boards for an easy way to create your shelter.",

        "The instructions are simply guidelines you can use if you\u2019d like.",
        "Snap together the sides of 2 pieces to assemble the fort boards.",
        "The fort boards have small pieces of plastic that easily snap into another board.",
        "To do this, place 2 boards next to each other and align the small plastic sections on the side.",
        "They should easily snap together without much force.If you are having trouble connecting the boards, review your instructions.",
        "Build your fort boards into cubes to easily them stack together.",
        "Connect the boards into a cube shape by securing 4 on each side, 1 on the top, and 1 on the bottom.",

        "This is a great idea if you want to create a stable foundation out of fort board cubes.",
        "Make 5-10 fort board cubes, and place them immediately next to each other in a row.",
        "Create a wall of fort boards if you want to cover a large area.",
        "In addition to making boxes, you can also keep the fort boards flat to make a wall.",
        "Instead of creating cubes, connect the fort boards into a 3 ft \u00d7 5 ft (0.91 m \u00d7 1.52 m) section, for instance.",
        "Then, place this at the front of your fort to act as a barrier.",

        "The fort kit also comes with blue attachment pieces that keep the fort boards in place.",

        "You can do this whether you are making a wall or securing cubes.",
        "Add a blue hinge piece in between each board you\u2019d like to reinforce.Your instructions should come with a diagram of how to do this if you need assistance.",
        "The fort board has a square plastic cube in the middle, and around the cube are 3 small plastic connector pieces.",
        "You can secure the hinge pieces to any of these connector pieces.",

        "Connect as many boards as you\u2019d like to make your shelter.",
