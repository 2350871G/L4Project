Because cat eyes are so dramatic, darker eyeshadow colors can look overdone. Instead, consider using a color that matches your skin tone or is slightly lighter. Don't use a cream eyeshadow.

If you use pencil eyeliner, you'll need to draw on several layers to make a cat eye, and the final result won't look as smooth.

        "Stick it to your hand and pull it up several times to remove some of the adhesive.",
        "This will make the tape less tacky and gentler on the delicate skin around your eye.",
        "Tapping the tape on the back of your hand before applying it to your skin will also make it less likely to cause discomfort when you remove it.Variation: As another option, you can use a sticky note instead of tape.",
        "If it's very sticky, you might want to tap your sticky note against your hand before you apply it.",
        "This will remove some of the adhesive.",
        "Position the tape along the outer corner of your eye.",
        "Place the tape just beneath your lower lashes, and angle the top towards your temple.",
        "Then, use the pad of your finger to lightly tap it down so that your eyeliner doesn't bleed under the tape.",
        "For a more dramatic look, angle the tape towards the end of your eyebrow instead.",
        "This will result in a thicker line.",
        "If your eyelids are hooded, position the tape at less of an upward angle and closer to a horizontally straight line.",
        "Draw a line from the inner corner of your eye to the outer corner.",
        "Apply your liquid, felt tip, or gel eyeliner as you normally would, but make the line thicker as it goes towards the outer corner of your eye.",
        "However, don't draw past the corner or onto the tape just yet.",
        "If you are having trouble applying the eyeliner smoothly, don't tug on the outer corner of your eye.",
        "Instead, tilt your head back slightly and lower your gaze to see your lash line.",
        "Alternatively, rest your pinkie finger against your cheek to steady your hand as you draw.",
        "When you're doing cat eyes, it's best to use liquid, felt tip, or gel eyeliner.",
        "If you only have pencil eyeliner, you can layer it to create a similar result, but it won't look as smooth.",
        "Use the tape as a guide to extend the line past the corner of your eye.",
        "Slowly pull your eyeliner across your skin just above the tape.",
        "As you reach the end of the tape, taper the line to a thin point.",
        "Follow the tape line as smoothly as possible, and don't worry if you get some eyeliner onto the tape.",
        "You can make the \"flick\" of your cat eye as long or as short as you want.",
        "The longer it is, the more dramatic your cat eye will be.",
        "When you first start doing a cat eye, it's easiest to make a very short flick by extending your eyeliner slightly past your eye, over your crease.",
        "Remove the tape carefully and make any touch-ups, if necessary.",
        "Grasp the tape by the lower edge, then slowly and gently peel it off of your skin.",
        "When you pull the tape off, you will see a nice, crisp line.",
        "If the tape removed any eyeshadow, carefully patch it up with more eyeshadow.",
        "If you usually apply any under eye concealer, you can do so now.",
        "If you used a pencil eyeliner, you may need to do several layers of eyeliner to get a cat eye look.",
        "Finish off with mascara or false lashes.",
        "Apply a few coats on your upper lashes and a single coat on your bottom lashes.",
        "For a more glamorous, evening look, curl your lashes or pop on a pair of false lashes."
