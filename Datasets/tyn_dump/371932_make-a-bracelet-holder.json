    "text": " Making  Wooden Tree Choose a wooden candlestick. The type you can get from a dollar store or a craft store are ideal. It needs to be tall enough to hang your bracelets from. Choose a thick, wooden dowel that is about 10 to 12 inches (25.4 to 30.48 centimeters) long. Try to find a dowel thick enough to cover the hole in your candlestick. You may need to cut it down to the right length. If you can't find a wooden dowel, stuff a rolled up magazine into a paper towel tube, and use that instead. Find the center of the dowel and mark it with a pen or pencil. Measure across the dowel with a ruler, and make a mark in the center. Don't worry, you don't see the mark once you are done painting. Draw a line of glue across the top center of the candlestick. Make sure the line is going from side to side. The candle hole will interrupt your line. You can use wood glue, tacky glue, or an industrial strength glue for this. Press the dowel down into the glue. Make sure that the mark you made earlier is right in the middle of the candle hole. Try to center the dowel on top of the candlestick as much as possible. If you see any excess glue, wipe it off quickly with a damp paper towel. Wait for the glue to dry. Once the glue dries, you can strengthen your holder by filling the seam between the dowel and the candlestick with more glue. Spray paint the bracelet holder. Take the bracelet holder to a well-ventilated area and protect your work surface with newspaper. Shake a can of spray paint, hold it 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) away from the holder, and spray on a light, even coat. Wait for the coat to dry, then apply a second one, if necessary. Most spray paints will dry in 20 minutes to 2 hours. It is better to apply your paint in many thin coats rather than one thick coat. This will give you a smoother finish and prevent any drips or puddles. You can also prime your holder first using a spray on primer. Choose white for a light color, and black or grey for a dark color. Spray the holder with an acrylic sealer and let it dry. Once the paint dries, shake a can of some acrylic sealer, hold it 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) away from the holder, and spray on a light, even coat. Wait for the sealer to dry, then apply a second coat. Avoid applying the sealer too thickly, or you will get drips and puddles. Most sealers will take about 2 hours to dry; some will also require a curing time, which will be specified on the can. Choose a glossy finish if you want your holder to be shiny. Choose a matte finish if you don't want it to be shiny. Consider embellishing your holder. Once your holder dries, it is ready to go. You can leave it as it is, or embellish it further to better match your room decor. You can use hot glue or super glue to attach these embellishments. Here are some ideas to get you started:\nGlue a pretty button or bead to each end of the dowel. Try to choose a bead or button that is the same diameter. Glue some small pearls, beads, or silk flowers around the top edge of the candlestick. Glue a large bead or ornament on top of the holder, right in the center. Wrap ribbon around the dowel in a spiral. Making a Cardboard Tree Use the bottom of the paper towel tube to trace two circles onto a sheet of cardboard. Place the paper towel tube right onto the tape, and use a marker to trace around it. These circles will cover the ends of your paper towel tube. Cut the circles out and hot glue them to each end of the paper towel tube. Use the gun to draw a line of glue all the way around the top edge of the paper towel tube. Place the circle, tape side out, onto the glue. Wait for the glue to set, then repeat this step for the other side. Trim off any excess cardboard from the edges. Make your base. Cut two 6 by 6 inch (15.24 by 15.24 centimeters) squares out of cardboard. Use hot glue to glue the two squares together. Make sure that the edges are aligned neatly. This will make your base. Cover the toilet paper tube, the paper towel tube, and the cardboard base with duct tape. Be sure to cover the ends of the paper towel tube as well. Do not attach the pieces together just yet, however. You to cover them first before assembling them. If you don't want to use duct tape, consider using fabric instead. You can also paint it using spray paint or acrylic paint, but the texture of the tubes will show through. Cut two half circles into the top of the toilet paper tube. The flat part of each half circle should be aligned with the top edge of the tube. The half circles will make the grooves for the paper towel tube to sit on. Hot glue the paper towel tube into the grooves. Draw a line of hot glue down each groove. Find the center of the paper towel tube, and press it right into the glue. If you want to hide the seams between the top of the toilet paper tube and the sides of the paper towel tube, fold a long strip of duct tape over the top of the paper towel tube, and press the two ends down the sides of the toilet paper tube. Hot glue the toilet paper tube onto the base. Draw a thick line of hot glue around the bottom edge of the toilet paper tube. Find the center of the base, and stick it down. If the glue is not strong enough, you may have to reinforce it with more duct tape. Making a Box Find a cardboard box large enough to hold your bracelet collection. The box can be plain, or it can be decorated. Craft stores sell many beautiful cardboard boxes that would be perfect for storing bracelets. Paint the box using spray paint or acrylic paint. You can make the box all one color, or use different colors for the inside and the outside. If you want to add designs to your box, paint the background color first, let it dry, then add the designs. If your bracelets are delicate, consider covering the inside of your box with velvet. Measure the height and width of box. You will need these measurements to make your dividers. Cut a few pieces of cardboard according to those measurements. This will give you several long compartments for you to store your bracelets in. If you want a half-sided compartment, then cut several shorter pieces of cardboard to use as a divider between two compartments. Paint the cardboard pieces using spray paint or acrylic paint. You can match the color to the inside of the box, or use a contrasting color. Paint one side and let it dry first. Flip the pieces over, then paint the other side. If you covered the inside of your box with velvet, then you might want to use velvet for this as well. Glue the dividers into the box. Coat the bottom and side edges of a divider with liquid glue, and slide it into the box. It should fit snuggly. If it flops over, consider bracing it with a heavy object, such as a jar. If you need to reinforce the dividers, wait until the glue dries, then draw a line of glue between the seams. If you are using shorter dividers: glue in all of the long/horizontal dividers first, then add in the short/vertical dividers. Consider adding a paper towel tube for the bracelets that need to be draped.You can take the tube out to remove the bracelets whenever you want. To add a tube, follow the directions below. Cut the paper towel tube down until it is at least an 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wider than your box. Paint the tube, or cover it with velvet fabric. Cut deep grooves into each side of the box, wide and deep enough for the paper towel to sit in. Slip your bracelets onto the tube. Set the tube down into the grooves. Finished. ",
