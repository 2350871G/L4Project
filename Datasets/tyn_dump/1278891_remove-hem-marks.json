Use them as you work to avoid stretching or cutting your fabric, which can make the mark removal process harder. Stitch removers are also known as seam rippers. Place the seam ripper underneath one stitch. Choose a stitch near one side of your hem's end. Hook the stitch with your seam ripper and pull it up. Given enough force, this should break the thread. Skip ahead several stitches and pull on the seam. Three or four stitches ahead is usually sufficient. Set the stitch remover aside and pull on the on the seam with your fingers. Continue pulling on the seam until the tail end of the string is removed from the fabric. Cut the string with a sharp pair of scissors for a clean break. Avoid breaking the string as you pull to keep from damaging the fabric. Remove every third or fourth stitch. Continue breaking stitches as you work up the hem until you have removed it entirely. Once you're finished, smooth your garment as much as you can to avoid more creasing. Fold your garment away until you are ready to iron away the hem marks. Applying a Borax Solution Make a borax solution using borax, vinegar, and water. All-purpose borax solutions work well for removing hem lines. Mix two tablespoons (1 oz) of borax with two tablespoons (1 oz) of white vinegar in a bowl. Add two cups (16 oz) of hot water and a small squirt of dish soap to complete the solution. Turn your garment inside out. You will achieve best results if you can iron the hemlines as directly as possible. While turning your garment inside out, check the tag for its fabric material. If it's made of a delicate material (like satin), remember to use a low setting on your iron. Dip a clean cloth into the solution. Wring your rag out after dipping it in the solution. Ideally, your garment will be slightly damp but not soaked. Continue squeezing the cloth until it no longer drips over the solution bowl.

The borax solution will help your fabric absorb the heat and return to its natural shape. Rub the garment in circular motions until the entire hemline is damp.
