They may not be able to tell you the exact services, but they can give you an idea of what they look for and at what price. Use a mentor or professional network to ask people in different but similar markets what they charge. If someone is a consultant in a different state, they may be willing to share industry knowledge. Keep in mind that people on the coasts or in cities can charge 25 percent more than in other areas. Sign up for a consulting session on a business mentor site like PivotPlanet.

If you don't have a package of services set up, this may be the best way to start until you get a better idea of what your clients will want. IT consultants and social media consultants usually charge by the hour. Other consultants use a project-based rate. This requires you to know the details of the project very well and have a good understanding of your own efficiency. Marketing, public relations, web design and graphic design often charge by the project. If you have to supply something and it isn't heavily dependent on other parties, this can be your best option; however, there are some risks to doing this. If the project gets delayed by the company, or they ask to completely redo it, you can find yourself with a low hourly rate or being unable to bill. Some professionals, such as lawyers, CPA and financial consultants keep a retainer. They project an hourly rate and how many hours the project will take and ask the client to pay in advance. This is an excellent way to guard against potential non-payment; however, a retainer is hard to sell in some industries like writing, marketing and customer service."

When you triple your wage and round up to the nearest multiple of 5 or 10, you should have a reasonable rate for providing for all 3 of these payments.

If your doubled or tripled hourly rate is in the range you found during your research, then it is likely you can move forward and decide whether you want to offer project or retainer rates.
