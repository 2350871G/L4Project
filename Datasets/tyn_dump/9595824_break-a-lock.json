This method can be useful if you need to remove your padlock without the keys but don\u2019t want to destroy it in the process. Breaking a Padlock with a Pair of Wrenches Get a hold of two open-ended wrenches. Any size wrench will do to the trick. In general, however, the bigger the head, the better the wrenches will work, as they\u2019ll be able to exert more pressure on the lock. It\u2019s important that both wrenches be close to the same size in order to ensure that the force is evenly distributed to both sides of the shackle, or the U-shaped metal clasp that fastens the lock. Hook the open ends of the wrenches over each side of the shackle. Once you have the wrenches in position, bring the handles as close together as you can.

        "Using a key to align the pins with the lock plug causes the lock to open.",
        "Jiggle the screwdriver while thrusting it in and out of the lock.",
        "Slide the blade of the screwdriver back and forth slowly.",
        "At the same time, work the handle of the around at different angles to engage as many pins as possible.",
        "Most tumbler locks are designed to release automatically if a minimum number of pins are shifted correctly.",
        "Avoid letting the screwdriver slip too far out of the lock.",
        "Doing so could cause you to start missing pins, effectively undoing the progress you\u2019ve made.",
        "Continue jostling the lock until it springs open.",
        "If you manage to hit all of the right tumblers, the lock will pop open on its own.",
        "Until then, it will remain shut fast and refuse to budge.",
        "Don\u2019t be discouraged if it takes a while to get the desired result\u2014just keep wiggling and sliding.",
        "If you stick with it long enough, there\u2019s a good chance that your patience will be rewarded.",
        "Be careful about performing this trick in public places.",
        "If someone sees you, they might think you\u2019re breaking into something that\u2019s not yours.",
        "If you\u2019re not getting anywhere with your screwdriver, come back with a hammer or pair of wrenches and see if you have better luck.",
        "Busting a Bike Lock Using Compressed Air Grab a canister of compressed air and a hammer.",
        "You can buy compressed air at any hardware store or home improvement center, as well as most supermarkets and drugstores.",
        "Chances are, you already have a hammer in your garage, tool box, or utility drawer.",
        "The secret to breaking a lock with compressed air is that compressed air isn\u2019t actually \u201cair\u201d at all\u2014it\u2019s a cooling gas known as difluoroethane, which freezes the lock and makes it brittle enough to break manually.Tip: A sledgehammer will offer far greater leverage and striking power than an ordinary hammer if you\u2019re up against a hefty U-lock.",
        "Just make sure you use one with a head made of metal rather than rubber.",
        "Spray one end of the lock continuously for about 20-30 seconds.",
        "Focus the stream on the area where the shackle inserts into the collar of the lock.",
        "You may notice the metal appear to grow lighter in color or take on a frosted appearance by the time you\u2019re finished.",
        "Difluoroethane is cold enough to cause frostbite on exposed skin.",
        "Always wear gloves to protect your hands anytime you're working with compressed air.",
        "You need to use enough compressed air to cool the lock to a temperature of \u221213 \u00b0F (\u221225 \u00b0C) in order to weaken it enough to become breakable.",
        "Bash the lock with the hammer until it breaks.",
        "It may take a few good hits to fracture the metal surrounding the locking mechanism, even if it\u2019s reached the requisite \u221213 \u00b0F (\u221225 \u00b0C).",
        "Try to pinpoint each strike at the exact same spot to up your chances of success.",
        "Keep in mind that your lock will no longer be functional once you break it.",
        "In most cases, the metal will actually shatter into pieces.",
        "This method also works on chain and cable locks, so you should be able to retrieve your bike no matter how you've secured it."
