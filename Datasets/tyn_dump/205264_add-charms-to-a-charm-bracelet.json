It's a small piece of wire formed into a circle with the ends touching. If not, purchase one at a local or online craft supply store. You'll usually need to buy a package of jump rings rather than just one. Jump rings are measured by diameter and gauge (the thickness of the wire). Pick a ring with the smallest diameter that will comfortably fit both the charm and your bracelet link with a bit of space for movement. A jump ring will provide an elegant, seamless-looking attachment for your charm. However, if you plan to move or switch out your charms regularly, consider a split ring or lobster clasp instead."

Gently push one side away from you while pulling the other side towards you until there is a small gap between the two ends of the ring. Refrain from pulling the ends apart side-to-side.
