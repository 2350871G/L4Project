In order to be comfortable for an entire night of sleep, the bathtub must be long enough for you to stretch out in and wide enough that your shoulders won\u2019t be cramped and you can keep your spine in alignment so your back won\u2019t hurt in the morning. If the tub isn\u2019t big enough, the floor may be a better option after all. Sleeping on the floor actually has some health benefits and can be good for an achy back! Make sure you have room to sleep on your back but can also roll over onto your side so you won\u2019t be uncomfortable staying in one position all night."
