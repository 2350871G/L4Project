                    "description": "Depending on how the door was damaged, there may be some loose splinters or fragments around the edges of the hole or crack. Rather than trying to repair these, use a utility knife to cut away any damaged wood until you\u2019re left with a clean hole free from rough edges. Always cut away from yourself when working with a utility knife, especially when cutting through something sturdy like wood. You may need to make the hole or crack bigger before you can begin repairing it. It\u2019s much easier to repair a larger hole free from damaged wood than it is to repair a smaller one that\u2019s fragmented or broken."

        "Use a sheet of coarse grit sandpaper, around 100- to 120-grit, to begin sanding down your repair compound.",
        "Sand off the spackle or auto-body filter until it is level with the surface of the door and it looks flat.",
        "Sanding down the door will help you smooth out the repair job to make it less visible.",
        "However, it will rough up the surface around the hole or crack.",
        "To fix this and make the door look completely undamaged, paint or stain the door.",
        "Repairing a Scratched Door Use very fine grit sandpaper to remove loose splinters and paint.",
        "Use 320-grit sandpaper to sand down any areas where the paint is peeling and/or the wood is splintering.",
        "Clean up the scratched area so that you can patch it rather than piecing it back together.",
        "If the wood is significantly splintered, wear heavy gloves while sanding to avoid injuring yourself.",
        "Apply a generous coat of wood filler to the scratched area.",
        "Squeeze or spread a small dollop of wood filler over each scratch on your door.",
        "Use your finger or a putty knife to spread the filler around and press it into the scratches.",
        "Try to achieve a smooth finish that is even and level with the rest of the door.",
        "Wood filler is available online or from your local hardware store.",
        "It will either come premixed in a tube or in 2 separate parts that need to be combined before using it.",
        "Follow the instructions on your wood filler for the best results.",
        "Leave the filler to dry for 15 to 20 minutes.",
        "The filler needs to set up and fully adhere to the wood in order for it to repair the door.",
        "Once you have pressed filler into all of the scratches, leave it for 15 to 20 minutes to dry fully, until it is completely solid to the touch.",
        "Check the instructions on your wood filler for more information on expected drying times.",
        "Sand down the wood filler with 320-grit sandpaper.",
        "Once the filler has dried, use very fine grit sandpaper to sand down previously scratched area.",
        "Work in smooth, deliberate strokes to remove any excess wood filler and flatten the surface of the door.",
        "Painting over the sanded area will make any irregular bumps more obvious.",
        "Run your hand over the area you patched with wood filler to catch any areas that need more sanding and smoothing.",
        "Clean the area with a damp paper towel or sponge.",
        "Sanding the wood and paint around the scratched area can produce a significant amount of dust and debris that can ruin the look of the repaired door.",
        "Dampen a clean cloth or a paper towel and lightly wipe down the area to clean up any dust left behind.",
        "Refinishing a Hollow Core Door Sand down the area you repaired and wipe away the dust.",
        "To make sure the paint or wood stain sticks evenly to the area you are painting or staining, use 220-grit sandpaper to sand down the repaired area.",
        "Use a vacuum cleaner or a damp cloth to wipe away any dust or debris.",
        "Dust will prevent the paint from sticking to the door properly, leaving an uneven surface.",
        "Clean away any dust before refinishing the door.",
        "Remove any hardware or hinges from the door.",
        "It's best to paint or stain the entire door to achieve an even finish, rather than only painting or staining the area you repaired.",
        "Use a screwdriver to remove the hardware from the door.",
        "You might need to remove the doorknob, hinges, or a strike plate near the base of the door.",
        "If you want to remove the door from its hinges entirely, press a nail against the base of each hinge pin and use a hammer to pop out the pins.",
        "This will let you refinish the door elsewhere and make the job easier.",
        "Check the screws in each fitting or fixture to choose the right screwdriver to use.",
        "You should always remove and reattach fixtures to a hollow core door with a screwdriver, as an electric drill can easily damage the door.",
        "Alternatively, you could use painter\u2019s tape to tape off areas you don\u2019t want to paint over.",
        "Find paint or wood stain that matches the color of your door.",
        "Choosing the right color of paint or wood stain will make sure that the repaired door matches the rest of the doors in your home.",
        "Ask an employee at your local hardware store for some paint or wood stain samples or ask for help in choosing the right paint to match the color of your door.",
        "While taking a picture of your door to help match the color might seem like a good idea, it won\u2019t always lead to a direct match.",
        "The lighting in your home, the type of camera used, and the way the picture is printed or displayed will all change the color.",
        "If you can, bring in a sample of the door to help match it \u2014 such as a piece of the door you cut away when first repairing it.",
        "Apply an even coat of paint or wood stain to the entire door.",
        "Use a broad, all-purpose paintbrush or a paint roller to apply a single coat of paint or wood stain to the door.",
        "Paint or stain any grooves or panels first, then paint long, even strokes over the rest of the door to avoid leaving visible lines.",
        "If you\u2019re worried about making a mess, lay down a drop cloth or some old newspaper underneath the door before you begin painting.",
        "Leave the door to dry for 3 to 4 hours.",
        "Once you\u2019ve applied the first coat, allow the door to dry for 3 to 4 hours.",
        "Even slight contact with the door can damage the finished look, so make sure everyone who might come in contact with it knows that it is still wet.",
        "Check the instructions on your chosen paint or stain for more information on the expected time it takes for it to dry.",
        "Apply a second coat of paint or wood stain and let it dry.",

        "Leave it to dry fully until the door is no longer damp or tacky to the touch.",
        "Many interior paints and stains will take several days to cure completely.",
        "Be careful with your repaired door for 1 week after painting it to avoid damaging your coat of paint.",
        "You can apply as many coats of paint or stain as you want, but 2 or 3 coats will normally be plenty to make your door look fantastic."
