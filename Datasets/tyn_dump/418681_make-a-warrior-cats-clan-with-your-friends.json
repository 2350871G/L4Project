            "description": "Every clan needs a leader - this must be an experienced reader (whoever has read the most books or gained the most knowledge) and somebody that will be a good roleplayer. Next, the leader needs to choose a deputy. The deputy should have read at least a series of books. The leader should test a few willing people and then choose somebody reliable. If your clan is nefarious, the leader should make sure the deputy is wicked unless the leader isn't actually evil and they want their clan to be well off. The medicine cat should be a smart, quick learner, who has read a good amount of the Warriors books. Medicine cat\u2019s should be good role-players who can act fast. They don't actually need to know all that much about herbs, but suggest them searching up different plants and how they can be used. Warriors are very important so you should have at least three of them. They are the most common of the grown-up ranks. Apprentices need good mentors, preferably ones that have been warriors/medicine cat for a while. Senior warriors will do the trick. Apprentices despite common depiction are close to the same size as warriors, but lack the experience, tactics, and wisdom of their older counterparts. Medicine cat apprentices only become full medicine cats when their mentor has passed away. Kits are usually cute and clueless, or don't know as much about warriors. If you have kits, make sure you have queens. It is also fun to have elders. Storytellers made wonderful elders. Elders are best fitted by great role players, who have patience. However, in the case that you don't have many members, suggest each person having more than one character. Playing the same role in a small group becomes boring fast. Also, make sure an apprentice receives their warrior name - don't stick with the same rank."

            "headline": "Name your characters.",
            "description": "Names are very important. Your members must have warrior names unless they were formerly a loner/rogue/kittypet. Names for kits must end in -kit. Apprentice names end in -paw. If your cat has a certain interesting feature, like a disfigurement, you can add that into the name. Medicine cat names/warrior names usually end in body parts, but it is more creative to think of suffixes other than -pelt, -fur, -leg, etc. Be aware that medicine cat names don't usually end in claw, because medicine cats rarely fight. Deputies keep their warrior names unless they become leader, in which they take -star as their leader name suffix. Elders keep their warrior names unless something has changed about them. For example, if a cat named Maplefoot had twisted her paw, she may change her name to Twistedleg. These names can be interesting, and describe your character well, but normal names are nice too. Make sure all names are natural. Unless they are kittypets (house cats), you would hardly find a cat named Mustangpaw, or a silly name like Awesomepaw, Cocopaw, or Phonepaw! That is why it is vital to have a nature-related names. For ideas, imagine things you would see out in nature - TVs and cars aren't one of them. Instead, think of plants, animals, clouds and water, among others. Do not create mean names, or somebody can get hurt, refuse to join, or tell on you as bullies, which you don't want to be. You can have somebody make nametags to help remember your warrior names."
