When training your chickens, give them a treat after they do something right. Try to use treats that are different than their regular food. Some easy treats that chickens love are dried mealworms, bird seed, fruits, and vegetables. Come up with a sound your chickens will recognize during training. These sounds are called bridges. Any sound can be a bridge, as long as you can make it consistently so your chickens don\u2019t get confused. Use the bridge right after your chickens do something right and before you give them a treat. They\u2019ll start to associate the bridge with getting a reward. The bridge you use with your chickens could be the word \u201cawesome\u201d or you whistling.

Let your chickens see the treats in your hand so they approach you. Continue to do this around 2-3 times a day so your chickens associate food with the bridge noise. Make sure you\u2019re making your bridge noise first and giving them treats immediately after. Start hiding the treats while making your bridge noise after a few days of training. Watch your chickens reactions after you bridge. If they perk up and approach you like they're waiting for food, the training is working. Give them the treats after they've come to attention and approached you. If your chickens aren\u2019t associating your bridge noise with food, keep training them until they do. It could take several weeks for all of your chickens to get there. Let your chickens roam free once they associate your bridge noise with food. Make sure all of your chickens are adequately trained before you let them out.

Make the bridge noise when you\u2019re ready for your chickens to come home. You may need to make it several times so all the chickens hear it. When the chickens return, give them their treats. If any of your chickens don\u2019t respond to your bridge noise, go collect them and bring them back to the coop. Keep training them until they make the connection. Training Chickens to Perch on Your Hand Put your palm face up on the ground and hold a treat in your free hand. Hold the treat close to your palm that\u2019s on the ground, so that your palm is in between the treat and the chicken. Show the chicken the treat and wait for it to walk over. Keep holding the treat close to your palm on the ground so the chicken has to walk onto your palm to get it. Don\u2019t give the chicken the treat just yet. Make your bridge noise and give the chicken the treat once it\u2019s on your palm. Make sure both of its feet are on your palm before you bridge and give it the treat.

Look for one online or at your local pet store. Target trainers look like a long stick with a ball at the end. If you don\u2019t want to buy one, make one for your chickens by attaching a wiffle ball to the end of a chopstick. With a target trainer, you can train your chickens to go anywhere you place the target, whether it's in their coop, your hand, or another spot in your yard. Place the target near your chickens. It doesn't matter where you place it at this point, as long as your chickens can access it. Wait for your chickens to notice the target and walk over to investigate. Reward your chickens when they get near the target. It\u2019s OK if they\u2019re a few steps away at this point. Make your bridge noise and give them a treat. If your chickens aren't going near the target at all, show them treats to lure them over. Wait for your chickens to get closer to the target before you reward them again.
