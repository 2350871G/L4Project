The timing of the ignition refers to the point between the compression and the power strokes at which the spark plug fires, creating the combustion that results in your horsepower, forcing the piston down into the cylinder. When the piston comes up during the compression stroke, just before the piston gets to the top of its compression stroke (which is called \"top dead center\"),  the spark plug should fire. Over time, this tends to get misaligned somewhat, resulting in a less-than-optimum spark plug firing time. The distance before the \"top dead\" center is the ignition timing, and it's represented by a row of graded numbers on the balancer or flywheel through an access hole."

Numbers to the left of zero on the timing tape refer to the piston as it travels down, while numbers to the right of zero refer to the piston's upward motion.

Adjusting the Timing Loosen the bolt that secures the engine's distributor enough so that the distributor can be turned. To adjust your timing, all you need to do is turn the distributor housing one direction or the other, depending on whether or not you want to advance or move back the timing. If the rotor turns clockwise, you'll advance the timing by rotating the distributor counterclockwise, and vice versa.
