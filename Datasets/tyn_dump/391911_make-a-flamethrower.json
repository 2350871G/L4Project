    "text": " Using a Lighter (Minimum Flame) Get a lighter. You can buy these from most small stores. Take off the cover. It should snap or pull off but you can also use pliers. Adjust the wheel. Turn the adjustment wheel all the way to the plus side (usually the right). Turn it back to the left. Lift the tab up so that it isn't touching the wheel and turn the tab all the way back to the left. Set it down and repeat. You can do this several times to turn it up as much as possible. Turn it on. Be careful. You should get a 3\"+ flame. You can readjust as necessary. Make the flame bigger. Take it up a notch by spraying WD-40 or engine degreaser at the flame. Hold both far from your body and away from other people and flammable objects. It will make a HUGE flame. Using a Can (Medium Flame) Place rubber bands. Place two rubber bands around an aerosol can. You can use a can of Axe, hairspray, whatever. Place the bracket. Place the wall bracket (that should already be bent into a 90-degree angle) under the rubber bands so it's held onto the can somewhat securely. Get a sticky surface. Break off a bit of that plasti-tak and put it on the bottom of the candle (you can also use a lighter). Alternatively, you can use chewing gum. Attach it to the bracket. Attach the candle to the wall bracket using the plasti-tak or other sticky substance. Adjust as necessary. Line up the candle wick with the sprayer tip on the aerosol can. Light the candle. Be careful. Spray. Don't spray towards anything flammable. Be careful. Using a Super Soaker (Maximum Flame) Get a high quality water gun. It should be able to build and maintain pressure well, be made of high quality plastic, and hold a good amount of liquid. Get a metal bracket. You'll need a metal bracket, either flat or an L bracket depends on the gun you buy. Attach the bracket to the gun, so that the flat metal comes out parallel with the ground, about 1\" below the nozzle. Wrap the gun. Wrap the gun around the nozzle with tinfoil, so that only the open is exposed (and exposed as little as possible). This will help keep the gun from melting. Fill the gun. Fill the water reservoir with lighter fluid. Attach a candle. Attach a candle to the end of the bracket. You can use tacky, gum, or anything that isn't glue. Light the candle.
