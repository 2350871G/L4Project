The ceramic oil warmers are all 1 piece while the glass ones are usually a glass dish set on top of a metal or ceramic stand. You can purchase these in just about any store that sells candles and candle stands. The ceramic oil warmers are typically labeled for wax cubes or wax melts, but they will still work. The set up is still the same."

You want to only fill the dish a little less than halfway. You can use other types of liquid oil, such as olive oil or sunflower seed oil. These will add some fragrance to the burning incense. Vegetable oil has little to no fragrance. Thick oils, like argan, jojoba, and coconut are not good choices. Essential oils are not a good option either, because you won't smell the incense anymore. You must put some oil into the dish, otherwise you risk the dish becoming too hot and cracking. Don't use water as it will evaporate."
