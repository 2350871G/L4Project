        "For this step, fill a sink with cold water and gentle detergent, such as Woolite.",
        "Then, completely submerge the clothing in the soapy water.",
        "Take the opposite sides of the garment in each hand and gently rub them together to loosen any debris.",
        "Allow the garment to soak for a few minutes.",
        "Drain the soapy water and refill the sink with clean water.",
        "Move the garment up and down in the clean water until the detergent has been completely rinsed out.",
        "Roll the garment in a towel to gently push out the excess water.",
        "Avoid wringing, which can damage the fabric.",
        "Air dry the garment.",
        "Even if you don't have to worry about shrinking, the heat of the dryer can damage the fabric.",
        "Weather permitting, hang the clothing on an outdoor clothesline and allow it to dry in the sun.",
        "On a hot summer day, your garment could be dry in as little as three hours.",
        "If it's raining or too cold to hang your garment outdoors, air dry it on a drying rack or clothes hanger.",
        "Depending on the temperature and humidity level of your home, your garment will be dry in 24 to 36 hours."
