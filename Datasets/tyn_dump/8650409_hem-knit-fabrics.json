However, keep in mind that this does not work for all knit fabrics, and some people simply dislike the look of an unhemmed garment. For example, if you are making a jersey knit dress or skirt, then you can often get away with skipping the hem. To see if your fabric will hold up against a hem-free finish, try gently stretching the raw edge of the fabric to see if it frays or unravels when you do so. If it does, then skipping the hem may not be a great idea for your fabric. If it holds up, then you can probably skip the hem."
