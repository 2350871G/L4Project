If you don't have a crisper drawer, keep the kale in the door compartment or on a standard refrigerator shelf with the stems facing toward the back of the refrigerator. The back of the refrigerator is the coldest area, and the stems are the hardiest portion of the kale, so they're less likely to become damaged from the cold.
