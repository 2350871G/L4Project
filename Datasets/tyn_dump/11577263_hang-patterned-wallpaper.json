        "Use a smoothing tool and a box cutter to cut off excess paper at the ends.",
        "Push the wallpaper tightly into the creases at the top and bottom with a wallpaper smoothing tool.",
        "Use the smoothing tool as a cutting guide, slicing along it with the box cutter to remove the excess wallpaper at the top and bottom of the wall along the ceiling and baseboards.",
        "A wallpaper smoothing tool is a wide, flat plastic tool made for pushing wallpaper into creases.",
        "Lining up and Pasting the Next Strips Measure and cut the second strip.",
        "Use your measuring tape to measure the ceiling height plus 4 in (10 cm) from the cut end down and make a mark at the edge of the paper with your pencil.",
        "Draw a straight line across the width of the paper from the mark to the opposite side, then cut along it with a box cutter or scissors.",
        "It\u2019s important to always remember to measure the ceiling height plus 4 in (10 cm) so you have excess paper that allows you to line the patterns up perfectly.",
        "Position the second strip next to the first to ensure the pattern lines up.",
        "Dry fit the wallpaper next to the first strip you hung and line up the patterns vertically and horizontally, making sure the new strip is straight on the wall and even with the ceiling and floor.",
        "Take the strip back to the pasting table and lay it face-down once you are happy that it will fit properly next to the first strip.",
        "It\u2019s always a good idea to check the fit while the paper is dry before gluing it to the wall to double-check.",
        "That way, if you made any errors while measuring you aren\u2019t stuck with a piece of wallpaper that has glue on the back that won\u2019t fit.",
        "Note that you are not overlapping the strips of wallpaper, but rather butting the edges up against one another as tightly as you can without overlapping them at all.",
        "Apply glue to the back of the second strip.",
        "Spread the wallpaper glue from the center outwards using your paste brush as you did with the first piece of wallpaper.",
        "Make sure you cover it all right to the edges.",
        "Fold the bottom 1/3 of the paper loosely back over itself.",
        "Use the same technique you used for the first piece.",
        "Be careful not to crease the paper where you fold it over itself or it won\u2019t look good on the wall.",
        "Paste the second strip next to the first, unfolding and smoothing it as you go.",
        "Hold the second strip of wallpaper by the top edge and place it against the wall loosely, aligning the patterns carefully.",
        "Stick it to the wall and smooth it out with the wallpaper brush.",
        "Unfold the bottom 1/3 of the strip, paste it carefully so the patterns line up, and smooth it out from the top to bottom.",
        "Remember to brush out air bubbles from the center towards the edges.",
        "Smooth the seams between the strips using a wallpaper seam roller.",
        "Roll from top to bottom along the seam where the 2 pieces of wallpaper meet.",
        "Roll up and down over any areas where the seam looks uneven or has bubbles until it is totally smooth.",
        "A wallpaper seam roller is a small plastic roller made specifically for smoothing out the seams between pieces of wallpaper.",
        "Cut off excess paper at the bottom using your box cutter and smoothing tool.",
        "Push the top and bottom edges of the wallpaper into the creases where it meets the ceiling and baseboards.",
        "Use the box cutter to cut along it and remove the excess overlapping paper at the top and bottom.",
        "Repeat the process for the following strips of wallpaper.",
        "Follow all the same steps to align, paste, and smooth out each proceeding strip of wallpaper.",
        "Keep working your way around the room in the same direction until you have covered all the walls that you want to.Tip: If you have to paste any wallpaper around obstacles like window frames, use the same technique you used to trim off excess paper at the top on bottom of pieces.",
        "Push the wallpaper into the creases around the obstacle with the smoothing tool, then use it as a guide to cut off the excess with a box cutter.",
        "Once you get to a corner, use the smoothing tool and box cutter to trim off excess paper at the side, leaving about a 0.5 in (1.3 cm) overlap on the next wall.",
        "Always start in the corner of a new wall with a fresh strip of wallpaper and overlap it with the excess 0.5 in (1.3 cm) of the last piece on the new wall so the patterns line up.",
        "The corners are the only spots you ever overlap wallpaper.",
        "You could also use the off-cut excess paper from the last piece to start the new wall if it\u2019s easier to line up the patterns."
