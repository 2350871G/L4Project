Periods are often irregular for the first few years, so don\u2019t be frustrated by the irregularity if this happens to you. It\u2019s completely normal. Your period will come when it comes and leave when it leaves. There aren't any medicines, injections, surgeries, foods, or anything else that can make your period stop.
