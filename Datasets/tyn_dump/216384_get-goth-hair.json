Black hair is the signature trait of Goth hairstyles, adding a dark and mysterious vibe to even the simplest of Romantic hairstyling. If you have short hair, dying your hair black gives you an instant Goth vibe. For a Romantic look, use a curling iron to create loose waves, beginning at the root of your hair. If you have bangs, try parting your black hair far to the left or right and swiping your bangs across your forehead. Add loose waves with a curling iron for a darkly Romantic feel. If you have longer hair and don\u2019t want to spend a lot of time styling, create messy beach waves after dying your hair black for a low-maintenance, hauntingly Romantic Goth hairstyle."

Lightly tease your permed hair or style it in a loose top or side bun for a hauntingly Romantic vibe. If you do not want to permanently perm your hair, try wearing a teased curly wig instead. Select a wig with real or high quality synthetic hair for a more natural-looking result.

After creating your beehive, the bottom portion of your hair will still hang loose. Style this by tying it below the beehive in a bun or ponytail, or by curling with a curling iron. If your hair is naturally or dyed black, you can pair a simple beehive style with light face makeup and a darker eyeshadow and/or eyeliner for an easy Romantic Goth look. Creating a beehive is difficult with short hair, so if your hair is above your shoulders, you might want to try a different Goth look."

Attach your Goth-style decorative elements with a black or dark-colored bobby pin for a seamless look. Weave lace into a loose braid by tying the end of the lace to a small section of hair at the root of your hair and braiding as you normally would. For best results, tie the lace to an interior section of hair so that the outside of your hair will cover the knot. Attach dark-colored flowers, such as Blue Lady hellebore or Queen of the Night tulips, to your hairstyle with bobby pins to give your hairstyle a truly Romantic-era Goth vibe. For a Romantic Goth look, you can wear a simple short black veil or try a black veil embellished with black lace, ribbon flowers, or steampunk-inspired hardware.
