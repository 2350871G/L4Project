    "text": " Slicing the Onions and Dredging the Liver Discard the liver membranes if they haven't already been removed. Use your fingers to peel the thin, outer membrane off each liver. The membranes will come away easily. Try not to tear the liver as you remove the membranes. Liver is usually sold with the membranes already removed. Slice the livers into \u20442 in (1.3 cm) thick slices. Place 1 1/2 lb (680 g) of beef or chicken livers on a chopping board. Use a very sharp knife to slice the livers into strips. Be very careful when you use a knife to cut the liver thinly. Always make sure that you are using a sharp knife, as this is both safest and will make the best cuts. Cut 2 onions into thin \u20444 in (0.64 cm) slices. Place the onions on a chopping board and use a sharp knife to cut the ends off. Slice each onion in half and peel the skin off. Place the flat surface of each onion on the chopping board and carefully slice each half thinly. Combine the flour, black salt, and pepper. Pour \u00bd cup (64 g) of flour, 1 tsp (2.3 g) of freshly ground black pepper, and \u00bd tsp (2.5 g) of salt into a bowl. Use a fork to mix the ingredients thoroughly. Season the flour with more or less black pepper and salt depending on what you prefer. Dredge the liver slices in the flour. Place each slice of liver into the bowl with the flour, black pepper, and salt. Turn each slice over in the bowl to make sure that all of the sides are coated with the seasoned flour. Gently shake each slice of liver as you take it out from the bowl to remove the excess. A light flour coating is all that is necessary. Cooking and Serving the Liver and Onions Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a large skillet for 1-2 minutes. Pour 3 US tbsp (44 ml) of extra virgin olive oil into a large skillet that has a lid. Adjust the temperature setting to medium-high. Brown the slices of liver in oil over a medium-high heat for 2-4 minutes. Place the slices of liver into the skillet. Make sure that the slices form only 1 layer and do not overlap. Let each side of the liver slices cook for 1-2 minutes and use kitchen tongs to turn them over after each side has browned. If all of the liver slices cannot fit into the skillet in 1 layer, brown them in batches instead. Place the first batch of the browned liver on a warmed plate while the subsequent batch cooks. Place the sliced onions to the skillet. Add the 2 sliced onions into the same skillet as the liver. Use a wooden spoon to occasionally stir the ingredients as they cook. If you cooked the liver in batches, add all of the liver back into the pan. Add the broth and simmer the ingredients for 15-20 minutes until a gravy forms. Pour 1 cup (240 ml) of beef or chicken broth into the skillet. Use a wooden spoon to combine the liver, onions, and broth. Reduce the heat to low and cover the skillet with a lid.
