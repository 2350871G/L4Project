        "They're manufactured for underhood automotive use, are chemical and weather resistant, and make a solid electrical connection.",
        "We use them all over the place, in race car engine harnesses, streetcar harnesses, adding an electronic box/fan/whatever that we want to be able to quickly disconnect for service/replacement/testing.",
        "For example here's an underhood shot of a 2009 Dodge Challenger Drag Pak Stock Eliminator car-- we used Weather Pack Connectors throughout this installation allowing for quick disconnect and/or removal of all components, even the entire engine harness can be disconnected in seconds using the two larger 22pin bulkhead Weather Pack Connectors you can see back on the passenger side of the firewall."
