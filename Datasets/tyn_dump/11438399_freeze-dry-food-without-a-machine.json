If you\u2019re using your regular home freezer, set it to the lowest temperature possible, which is typically -10\u00b0F (-23\u00b0C). Most freezers are already set to 0\u00b0F (-18\u00b0C).

Washing them prior to drying will save you the hassle of having to wash them after you thaw them out. Use a vegetable brush or towel to scrub away stubborn bits of dirt from small crevices. Chop produce into pieces about 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) in size. Cutting them into slices or chunks about 1 inch (2.5 cm) to 2 inches (5.1 cm) across and less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick will help them dry out faster.

        "Cutting them into slices or chunks about 1 inch (2.5 cm) to 2 inches (5.1 cm) across and less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick will help them dry out faster.",
        "Try to make each piece about the same size so they dry at the same rate.",
        "If you\u2019re freeze drying small berries like blueberries, blackberries, or raspberries, there\u2019s no need to slice them.",

        "Place the pieces so that each one has \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) of free space.",
        "Arranging the pieces on the baking sheet with at least \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) of room between each piece will ensure that they don\u2019t get stuck together and that they dry evenly.",
        "Spread them into a single layer and make sure there\u2019s no overlapping.",
        "If you\u2019re freezing different types of food at one time, like potatoes and berries, put them on 2 separate baking sheets because they\u2019ll dry at different rates.",
        "Place the loaded baking tray into the freezer for 7 to 10 days.",
        "Put the tray on a shelf where it won\u2019t be disturbed for 7 to 10 days.",

        "Discard the black tester piece.",
        "To test meat, take a piece out, let it warm up for about 5 to 10 minutes, and bend it in half.",

        "Put the sliced chunks into freezer bags.",
        "Be sure to put only 1 type of food per bag rather than mixing different kinds of foods together.",
        "Then, push out all of the air from the bags with your hands or by rolling the air out (toward the opening) with a rolling pin.",
        "Pushing out the air will ensure that no ice crystals form on the food.",
        "Choose a storage box large enough that the bags only fill it half way.",
        "A large styrofoam cooler or large plastic container with a lid will work nicely.",
        "Note that the box will have to fit inside of your freezer, so if you have a small freezer, you may only be able to freeze dry small quantities of food at a time.",
        "Pick a plastic container you don\u2019t plan to use for other purposes because you\u2019ll need to put holes in the lid.",
        "Pour 1 pound (0.45 kg) of dry ice into the bottom of the box.",
        "Put on heavy duty gloves like leather or work gloves to pour dry ice over into the bottom of the box until it forms an even layer.",
        "The amount of dry ice you need to use is equal to the weight of the food.",
        "So if you\u2019re freezing 5 pounds (2.3 kg) of food, you\u2019ll need about 5 pounds (2.3 kg) of dry ice.",
        "If it doesn\u2019t cover the entire bottom of the box, add another 1 pound (0.45 kg) until it does.",
        "Depending on the width and length of the box, 5 pounds (2.3 kg) of dry ice should be enough for up to 4 layers of food.",
        "Don\u2019t touch the dry ice with your bare hands\u2014it will burn your skin!",

        "Make sure not to stack two bags directly on top of each other.",
        "You may need to rearrange the pieces of dry ice so that the bags are fully covered.",
        "Make sure each bag lays as flat as possible and that there\u2019s no overlapping.",
        "Add a final layer of dry ice on top of the food bags.",
        "Depending on the size of the box and the number of bags you have, you may need to do a few alternating layers of dry ice and food bags.",
        "Each layer of food should have dry ice on top of and underneath it.",
        "Poke a few holes into the lid and attach it to the box.",
        "Use a box cutter or sharp knife to cut 3 to 4 holes into the top of the box.",
        "These holes allow gas and moisture to escape, which is necessary for the dry ice to dissipate and for the food to fully dry.",
        "Avoid poking too many holes into the lid.",
        "The idea is to allow the gas to escape at a relatively slow rate.",
        "Place the box into the freezer for at least 24 hours.",
        "The food is done freezer drying when all of the dry ice has disappeared.",
        "This could take 24 hours or more depending on how many layers of food you\u2019re freeze drying (and how much dry ice you\u2019ve used to cover it).",

        "If it\u2019s all gone, the food is ready for storage.",
        "If you see any chunks of dry ice, reattach the lid, reinsert the box into the freezer, and wait for 3 to 6 hours before checking again.",
        "Store freeze-dried foods in freezer bags at room temperature.",
        "Since the foods are already in freezer bags, you can just take them out and put them in your pantry or anywhere that\u2019s at or below room temperature.",

        "Eat the freeze-dried chunks as is or rehydrate them by placing them in a small amount of water."
