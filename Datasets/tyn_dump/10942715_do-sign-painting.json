        "If your surface is light, use blue or black chalk.",
        "If your surface is dark, use white chalk.",
        "You can repeat this process and transfer this design to multiple surfaces if you\u2019d like.",
        "Simply lay the perforated pattern across another sign and use the pounce bag to mark with chalk.",
        "You can also use transfer paper to translate smaller designs onto the sign surface.",
        "Go over your design and plan out the individual brushstrokes.",
        "Before you even begin painting, it\u2019s a good idea to map out how you plan to approach each letter.",
        "As a general rule in sign painting, upwards strokes are thin and downwards strokes are thick\u2014considering the weight of each stroke in the letters you plan to paint, mark which strokes should go upwards and which should go downwards.",
        "Also determine the points at which your individual strokes will connect, to make the letter appear continuous.",
        "Dip your brush into the paint and shape the tip.",
        "Slide both flat edges of your brush along the edge of your paint cup to remove any extra.",
        "Your brush tip should be a sharp, flat chisel shape while still holding enough paint.",
        "If you have too much paint, it will drip and you\u2019ll have a hard time maintaining the shape of your stroke.",
        "If you have too little paint, your stroke won\u2019t feel as smooth and will appear streaky.",
        "Lay the brush at an angle on the sign, press down, and pull it up or down.",
        "This is the process to begin each individual stroke.",
        "Start by angling the brush so it aligns with the direction of the stroke.",
        "Once the brush is in position, gradually press down so the hairs widen out to create a thicker line.",
        "Then, pull the brush either up or down to create the stroke.",
        "You can use a mahl stick, a short wooden dowel with a leather ball at one end, to keep your hand steady as you paint.",
        "Your hand with the paintbrush will rest on the wooden dowel.",
        "Position the leather ball somewhere off the sign surface and keep it planted while you move the dowel with your hand that's not holding the paintbrush.",
        "You can also use your other hand as a support.",
        "Don\u2019t press too hard on the brush, which will over-widen your stroke.",
        "Exit the stroke by pulling to one side as you lift the brush.",
        "To finish a stroke, pull out to one side as you peel the brush away from the sign\u2019s surface.",
        "This will create a thin, tapered finish known as a \u201ckick\u201d or a \u201ctail.\u201d\nExperienced sign painters have particularly elegant kicks and tails on their lettering.",
        "Overlap your strokes to make your line appear continuous.",
        "Once you\u2019ve completed a stroke, begin your next stroke in a way that it overlaps with the previous one.",
        "Use the kick or tail from the previous letter as a starting point.",
        "Although each stroke of a letter in sign painting is created individually, the effect should be that it was painted in one smooth movement.",
        "Clean your brushes thoroughly with paint thinner or mineral oil.",
        "Fill three separate cups with paint thinner\u2014one to remove excess paint, another to clean it, and a final one to get rid of any remaining pigment.",
        "If you allow the enamel paint to harden at all on your brush, it will be ruined and you\u2019ll have to buy a new one.",
        "Once the brush is clean, oil the tips with lard or brush oil.",
        "You can also use petroleum jelly."
