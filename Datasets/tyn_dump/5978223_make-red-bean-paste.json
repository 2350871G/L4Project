Cover the bowl with a clean towel to keep out bugs and dirt, and set the bowl aside on the counter. Leave the beans to soak for 8 to 12 hours. Soaking the beans will help to tenderize them and reduce the boiling time. You can skip the soaking if you're going to cook the beans in a slow cooker. The most common beans to use for this paste are long dull and adzuki."

Transfer the beans to a  2-quart (1.9-L) saucepan and add enough water to cover them with 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of water. Bring the beans to a boil over medium heat. When the beans boil, turn off the heat, put on the lid, and let the beans steam for 5 minutes. Parboiling will help to remove bitterness from the beans, resulting in a sweeter paste."

Bring the beans to a boil again over high heat, and then reduce the heat to medium. Continue boiling the beans for about an hour, until they're soft enough that you can mash them with your fingers. As the beans cook, add more water to the pot as necessary to keep them covered. To cook the beans in a pressure cooker, cook them on medium-high heat until the pressure cooker reaches pressure, and then reduce the heat to low and cook the beans for 20 minutes. To cook the beans in a slow cooker, cover them with 2 inches (5.1 cm) of water and cook them on low for 8 hours.
