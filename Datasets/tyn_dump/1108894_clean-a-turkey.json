For a slightly faster thaw, place the turkey in a leak-proof bag and set it in a sink or bucket. Completely submerge it with cold water, changing the water every 30 minutes and allowing 30 minutes to thaw every 5 pounds (2.3 kg) of turkey. For the fastest method, place the turkey in a pan and use the defrost setting on your microwave to thaw it. Keep the turkey in its wrapping, unless you\u2019re thawing it in the microwave. If you thaw your turkey in the refrigerator, you can keep it there for up to 2 days before cooking it. If you thaw it in water or the microwave, you\u2019ll need to start cleaning and cooking it as soon as it\u2019s ready."

Use a sharp, strong knife to cut off the turkey\u2019s head and neck, starting 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) above the neck\u2019s connection to the body. You can also remove part of the wings, starting at the first joint to leave a drumstick-shaped section behind. The wings are edible, but they\u2019re difficult to pluck and typically don\u2019t have enough meat near the ends to warrant the extra effort. Heat a large pot of water to 140\u2013150 \u00b0F (60\u201366 \u00b0C). Fill a large pot with enough hot water to completely submerge your turkey. Aim for the water to be 140\u2013150 \u00b0F (60\u201366 \u00b0C), which is warm enough to loosen the feathers for plucking, but not hot enough to start cooking the skin.

Pull the turkey out and use a strong rope to hang it up by the feet. You can tie it to a strong tree branch or a sturdy beam in your garage, making sure to keep it over the pot to drip dry. Pluck out the feathers a few at a time. Starting at the back, start pulling out just a few feathers at a time, grasping them by the roots and plucking with a gentle tug.

Skinning a turkey is typically faster and cleaner than plucking it. It\u2019s a great option if you\u2019re planning to grill or fry your turkey in separate pieces. Hang the turkey up at chest level. Use strong rope to tie the turkey up by both feet, attaching it to a sturdy tree branch or beam. Tie the feet up separately, so that they\u2019re 12\u201318 inches (30\u201346 cm) apart.Tip: You can hang the turkey to any height, but keeping it at your chest-level will make for the easiest skinning process. Remove the turkey\u2019s beard, fan, and wings. Grasp the beard close to the body, twist it halfway around, then give it a firm tug to remove it from the breast. Set it aside or discard it, then remove the turkey\u2019s fan by cutting the skin away from the tail. Then, move on to the wings, cutting them off at the elbow or the second joint. Skin the tail and remove the neck. Hold the skin of the tail and start to pull it down the body. Use your hands to gently work it off around the wings and chest. Pull it down until it\u2019s at the turkey\u2019s neck, then stop. Cut off the neck and skin to finish the skinning process. Use a sharp, strong knife to cut off the turkey\u2019s head and neck, starting 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) above the neck\u2019s connection to the body. This will also take off the extra skin and feathers that you\u2019ve pulled down. Set the skin and head aside or discard them. Remove the turkey\u2019s innards before cooking or preserving it. To remove the turkey\u2019s insides, carefully open up the body cavity with a knife and remove the entrails. Wear gloves to protect your hands and make sure to remove all of the lung material, which is connected to the backbone, since it can rot quickly. Remove the legs and place the turkey in a baking dish if you want to cook it whole. If you prefer to cook or preserve your whole turkey, first cut off the legs at the knee or second joint, using a sharp, strong knife. You\u2019ll keep the thighs and drumsticks attached but remove and dispose of the scrawnier part of the leg, which won\u2019t have as much meat. Place it on a large baking dish if you\u2019re ready to cook it. If you want to freeze your turkey, put it in 2 plastic freezer bags and seal it as tightly as possible. You can keep it for up to 7 months before using it. Separate the breast fillets, thighs, and legs if you want to cook it in separate pieces. To cut the turkey into sections, lay it on its back and cut it along each side of the breastbone and on the inside of either wing. Pull at the breast fillet and use the knife to loosen it and lift it away from the breast bone, working from the rear to the front. To remove the thigh and leg of the turkey, cut through the thigh muscle at the back, then pull it up with your hand until the joint pops. Continue cutting through the thigh until you can remove it. If you have a smaller freezer, cutting your turkey into smaller pieces will make it easier to preserve. Put each section in 2 sealed plastic freezer bags and keep the turkey for up to 7 months before using.",
