        "The finished product will look a little bit like a popper, with a round bulb on one end and a long, winding trail coming out of the other.",
        "It's important for the tip of the paperclip to be touching the match head in order for it to transfer enough heat to cause ignition.Tip: Once you\u2019ve wrapped the match head and paperclip together, take a moment to smooth out the foil to ensure that it\u2019s packed as tightly as possible.",
        "Prop the rocket up on its base.",
        "Set the circular end of the paperclip against a flat surface so that the rocket is tilting upwards at a slight angle.",
        "Be sure to handle your launchpad carefully to keep it from tipping over.",
        "Make sure your rocket isn\u2019t pointed towards another person or any nearby objects.",
        "Light your rocket by holding a flame to the wire just below the foil.",
        "Use a match or long-handled lighter to heat the bottom of the rocket for 3-5 seconds.",
        "When the foil gets hot enough, it will cause the match head to ignite, propelling the rocket off of the paper clip.",
        "For your own safety, take a few steps back after lighting your rocket.",
        "The blast it makes won\u2019t be very big, but it could still be enough to cause burns if you\u2019re not careful.",
        "You can make a simplified version of this type of rocket using a whole matchstick.",
        "Just wrap the match head in foil and prop it up against a paperclip bent at a 45-degree angle.",
        "Building a Powerful Foil-and-Fuse Rocket Cut a length of fuse into six short sections and one slightly longer one.",
        "Snip each section straight across so that the ends are flush.",
        "For this project, you\u2019ll need six 3 in (7.6 cm) pieces and one 5 in (13 cm) piece.",
        "Use a ruler for reference while you\u2019re cutting the fuses to make sure they\u2019re all the right length.",
        "In many places, you can buy lengths of uncut fuse at fireworks shops.",
        "You may also be able to find them at stores that specialize in magic supplies.Warnings: Handle your fuses carefully.",
        "They\u2019re combustible, which means they could catch fire if they get too close to an open flame or other heat source.",
        "Glue the 3 in (7.6 cm) fuse sections around the 5 in (13 cm) section.",
        "Line the short sections up with the end of the longer section and glue them into place one at a time.",
        "When the glue dries, you\u2019ll have a bundle of fuses, with one long fuse emerging the center.",
        "It may be easiest to use super glue or another type of fast-drying adhesive so you won\u2019t have to hold the fuses together for a long time waiting for them to dry.",
        "Wrap the bundled fuses in aluminum foil.",
        "Start by folding a 4 in (10 cm) x 4 in (10 cm) square of foil in half once.",
        "Lay your fuses on one end of the folded foil with the long fuse sticking out and fold down the excess foil so that it covers the bundled fuses.",
        "Then, roll the fuses up tightly in the remaining foil.",
        "When it comes time to light your rocket, the foil will trap the energy released by the burning fuses, which will cause the rocket to sail into the air.",
        "Cover the foil in tape.",
        "Wind a roll of tape around the foil-covered fuses from top to bottom.",
        "Make sure to fold a strip over the top of the bundled end, as well.",
        "You shouldn\u2019t be able to see any of the foil peeking through.",
        "Wrap the fuses as smoothly as you can.",
        "Bubbles or wrinkles in the tape may create wind resistance that could slow your rocket down.",
        "A thick, grippy tape like duct tape or masking tape will work best.",
        "Avoid using clear tape, as it won\u2019t be strong enough to hold your rocket together.",
        "Tape a thin wooden skewer to the side of the rocket.",
        "Adjust the skewer so that the blunt end is flush with the top of your rocket.",
        "Wrap a single strip of tape around the outside of the rocket and skewer to hold them together.",
        "The skewer will provide just enough weight to stabilize your rocket in flight and help it travel straighter.",
        "It will also double as a convenient launchpad.",
        "Stick the rocket into the ground at an angle.",
        "Insert the sharp end of the skewer deep enough into the ground to prevent the rocket from falling over.",
        "For best results, your rocket should be pointing at a 50-60 degree angle.",
        "Look around for a nice soft patch of grass or dirt where you can safely set up your rocket.",
        "If the angle is too low, your rocket will simply shoot forward.",
        "If it\u2019s too high, it will blast straight up, then get caught by the wind and drift back to the ground.",
        "Light the exposed fuse to make your rocket blast off.",
        "Hold a long-handled lighter or lit match to the end of the fuse and wait for it to catch.",
        "When it does, take a few steps back to get clear of the burning fuse.",
        "After 2-3 seconds, the bundled fuses will ignite and send your rocket zooming into the sky!",
        "Be sure to keep your distance from the rocket until it has left the ground.",
        "If you get too close, you could accidentally get burned.",
        "After your rocket touches down again, douse it with water to make sure the fuses are completely out."
