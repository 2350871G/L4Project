        "If you\u2019re dying a piece of silk that weighs more than 4 oz (113 g), then be sure to use a basin large enough to fully submerge the material.",
        "For more accurate dye measurements, weigh your silk ahead of time.",
        "No matter how much silk you\u2019re dying, make sure that you have an 8 to 100 ratio of aluminum sulfate to silk along with a 7 to 100 ratio of cream of tartar.",
        "Dissolve aluminum sulfate and cream of tartar into some water.",
        "Create a dye mixture by dissolving 1\u00bd tsp (21.8 g) of aluminum sulfate and 1\u00bd tsp (1.65 g) of cream of tartar together in a small container of hot water.",
        "Stir both of the materials until they\u2019ve completely dissolved into the cup.",
        "Aluminum sulfate is known as a mordant, or a substance that preps the silk so that it can absorb a variety of plant-based dyes.",
        "You can find this at most stores that sell gardening supplies.",
        "Pour the mixture in a basin of lukewarm water.",
        "Fill a large basin or bucket with lukewarm water, making sure that the water is deep enough to fully submerge the silk.",
        "Next, add the aluminum sulfate and cream of tartar into the water and begin to stir.",
        "Continue mixing the water, aluminum sulfate, and cream of tartar until they have completely dissolved in the basin.",
        "Keep in mind that this process won\u2019t change the color of the silk.",
        "Instead, it brightens and modifies the silk, making it more receptive to natural dyes.",
        "Soak the damp silk into the basin overnight.",
        "Check to make sure that the material is drenched after placing the silk into the mixture.",
        "Stir the material occasionally, making sure that all of the silk is evenly covered.",
        "Hand wash the silk with 0.25 cups (59 mL) of laundry detergent and fabric softener.",
        "Put some gloves on before filling a basin with lukewarm water and placing your dyed silk inside.",
        "Next, add in a splash of detergent and fabric softener to the water.",
        "Wait around 10 minutes for the cleaning products to soak into the silk before wringing it out.",
        "If you want to get the silk extra clean, feel free to rub the material with your fingers.",
        "Dry the silk by rolling it in a towel.",
        "Spread a towel out on a flat surface, like an iron board.",
        "Next, take the damp silk and layer it on top of the towel.",
        "Squeeze out any excess water by rolling up the towel lengthwise.",
        "If you\u2019d like the silk to dry faster, go over it with an iron on medium heat.",
        "To prevent the silk from burning, place a pillowcase on top of the silk before ironing it.",
        "Using a Natural Dye Choose which plants to use for your natural dye bath.",
        "Pick a color that you\u2019d like to dye your silk\u2014it can be pastel or something darker.",
        "Keep in mind that many fruits and vegetables, when boiled, create natural dyes that you can use to recolor your silk.",
        "Go to your local grocery store or farmer\u2019s market to get what you need ahead of time.",
        "If you\u2019re looking for certain colors, try these: yellow onion skins for orange-yellow, spinach for green, turmeric powder for yellow, avocado skins for peach-pink, red cabbage for violet, and black beans for blue.",
        "Chop the ingredients and simmer them over low heat for 1 hour.",
        "Set aside a large pot and fill it with tap water.",
        "Next, mix in the ingredients of your choice to achieve different color results.",
        "Slice up the vegetables and fruits into small pieces (less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) pieces) and add it to the water.",
        "Let the ingredients stew for about 1 hour.",
        "Use enough tap water to comfortably submerge your silk item.",
        "Drain the raw material out and pour the dye water into a separate basin.",
        "Filter the dye as you pour it into a separate basin, using a colander to catch any of the solid pieces.",
        "Make sure that you have enough dye mixture for the amount of fabric that you plan on dyeing.",
        "Put the silk into the dye bath and let it soak overnight.",
        "Place your plain silk into the dye mixture, and make sure that it\u2019s fully submerged.",
        "Check that the fabric isn\u2019t crinkled when you place it in the water, or else it won\u2019t have a consistent shade.",
        "Depending on how vibrant you want to color to be, let the fabric sit in the dye bath for at least 1 hour.",
        "The longer the silk stays in the dye, the deeper the color will be.",
        "Rinse out the silk with cold water to get rid of any excess dye.",
        "Remove the dyed silk from the pot and hold it under a stream of cool, running water.",
        "Continue doing this until clear water is running out of the fabric.",
        "Finally, wring out the silk so that it\u2019s no longer dripping wet.",
        "If you hang up the silk to dry while it\u2019s still dripping, then it will take longer to dry.",
        "Hang the item up in an open area and let it air-dry.",
        "Check on the silk periodically over the next day or so to see if it\u2019s still damp.",
        "Depending on the size of the item, you might have to let the silk dry overnight.",
        "Don\u2019t worry if the color of the silk looks lighter after it dries\u2014this is all part of the process!"
