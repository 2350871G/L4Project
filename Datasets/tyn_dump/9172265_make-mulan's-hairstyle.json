For a more accurate style, keep the bottom part of the ponytail loose so that it poofs out. If you are using your natural hair color for this, use a hair tie that matches your hair color instead.

If your hair is still too short for a sock, try a faux bun, which can be purchased at local beauty supply stores. Tease the separated hair to either side of the part. Create a deep side part first. Mist the hair at the roots with hairspray, then tease it with a comb. Return the part to normal, then repeat this step for the other side. Make sure that you return the part to normal after teasing the other side. Some wigs already come teased at the front. If your wig is like this, you can skip this step. Pull the separated hair back towards the bun. Take the left side of the separated hair, and pull it back towards the bun. Keep it loose so that it drapes over the top of your ear.

The basic style is complete, but you still need to add some accessories to make it look like Mulan's. Wrap a red ribbon around the base of the bun. Choose a shade of red that matches your cosplay. The may be a bright red, a pinkish red, or even a shade of burgundy. Tie the ends of the ribbon under the bun, then tuck the ends out of side. Wrap the ribbon a few times around the bun. Don't tie it into a bow. Choose a ribbon that is 3/4 to 1 inch (cc to 2.54 centimeters) wide. Tuck a white flower into the side of the bun. You can use a fake flower or a flower comb.

If you are using a lace front wig, you'll need to vent in extra hair into the lace to give it a peak. Making Mulan's Comb Get a large, crescent hair comb. The comb needs to be about 4 to 5 inches (10.16 to 12.7 centimeters) long. It should be shaped like a semi-circle. You can find these online and in beauty supply shops. Paint the comb's handle with turquoise with acrylic paint. If you want to get fancy, you can use paint with a pearly finish (not glitter, however). For an even more accurate comb, paint the teeth dark green. Keep in mind that the teeth won't be visible in the end. Let the paint dry before moving on. Even though you'll only be decorating one side of the comb, it would still be a good idea to paint both sides. Add a gold petal design to the top of the comb. Mulan's comb has several overlapping lily petals along the top edge. You can draw these onto the comb using gold puffy paint, gold glitter glue, or gold nail polish. Let the paint/glue dry completely before moving on. Puffy paint and glitter glue take hours to dry. Be patient! Get a white flower with pointed petals. Choose a fake flower that's about the same height as the comb\u2014a little smaller would be even better. It should have pointed petals, such as a water lily or a poinsettia. For a more accurate comb, paint the stamen/center red. Glue the flower to the center of the comb. Pull the flower off of the stem first. Draw a swirl of hot glue on the back, then press it into the center of the comb's handle. Be careful not to get any glue in the teeth, or you won't be able to use the comb.",
