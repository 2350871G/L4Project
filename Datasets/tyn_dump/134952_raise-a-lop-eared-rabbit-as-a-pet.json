                    "description": "It can be tempting to impulsively buy lop-eared rabbits because of their adorable looks, but consider if this is the right pet for you before you purchase it. Any rabbit whose ears lop down the side of his head, rather than pointing up, is a lop. There are around 19 different breeds of lops, each with different sizes and characteristics. English lops and Miniature lops (known as Holland lops in the US) are popular as pets. Contact a local breeder, animal rescue centre, or pet shop. Rabbits live for around nine to eleven years, and require attention and care for all of these years. They are active and need space to run around."

                    "description": "Before you go ahead and get a rabbit you need to be sure that you can afford to keep it. The price of a lop can vary, but you should expect to pay somewhere between $15 and $60. As well as buying the rabbit you will need to spend approximately $90 for a cage, $30 for a carrier and $25 for a litter box. This is just to get you started. You should expect to have an average food bill of around $800 a year, and factor in $300 for toys and treats on top of that. After this add on $125 for a basic veterinary checkup with a rabbit-savvy vet, but keep in mind that rabbit veterinary medicine is a specialized field, and most vets do not know how to properly treat rabbits. It's crucial to have your rabbit spayed/neutered if s/he isn't already when you adopt him/her, and this often costs around $300. Illness or injury can run from $500 up into the thousands. Be prepared in case your rabbit becomes ill; the first sign of symptoms means it's an emergency as rabbits hide signs of illness until they are crucially ill.\nDon't forget $400 a year for litter."

                    "description": "Rabbits are small creatures, but they are very active with strong and powerful hind legs that are designed for running and jumping around. As such they need lots of space to move around freely. The minimum recommended exercise pen for a single rabbit of a small to medium-sized breed is four feet wide and six feet long. Do not use a wire cage! If you must use a wire cage be sure to cover the bottom of the cage with cardboard, or a piece of wood, covered over with bedding to protect their feet. Rabbits' feet are very delicate and can become inflamed and quickly infected from standing on wire."

Rabbits are grazers so it's essential that you have plenty of hay for them to nibble on throughout the day and night. A rabbit needs a good intake of grass or hay to keep their digestive system working properly. You should ensure that there is fresh hay available to your rabbit at all times. Your rabbit will eat a bundle of hay about the same size as him every day. Liberally spread the hay around the hutch and litter tray area. Rabbits like to eat hay while they are resting.
