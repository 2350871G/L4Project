Before beginning to handcuff an uncooperative suspect, concentrate on controlling them first. If you can\u2019t restrain them with your hands or body it might be best to step back and use a non-lethal method to subdue them, such as a Taser or an expandable baton. Always be ready for resistance, even if the suspect seems to be cooperative. If you are within six feet of a suspect you need to act as if you are anticipating a struggle. Speak confidently, keep your grip on firm, and apply the handcuffs swiftly."
