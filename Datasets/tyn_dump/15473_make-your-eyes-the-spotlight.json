                    "description": "To make your eyes stand out, it\u2019s important to choose the right shade of eyeshadow. A light color helps brighten and widen your eyes. However, you should choose a light shade that\u2019s opposite your eye color on the color wheel to create a contrast that makes your eyes pop. It\u2019s best to apply your lid shade with a flat, dense shadow brush. Red is opposite green on the color wheel, so green and hazel eyes look best with shadows that have a red undertone, such as plum, wine, or reddish brown. Orange is opposite blue on the color wheel, so blue eyes look best with peach, apricot, burnt orange, and copper shadows. Brown is a neutral color, so brown eyes look good with almost any eyeshadow shade. However, brown eyes usually best with blue and purple tones. Gray is also a neutral color, so gray eyes look good with a wide range of shades. For the best look, though, opt for earthy greens, cool browns, and purples."

                    "description": "To really define your eyes, you want to add definition to them. Using a lighter shade on the lid makes your eyes look bigger, but you should add a darker, mid-tone shade to the crease to add dimension to your look. Sweep the mid-tone shade into the crease with a tapered crease brush to help control where you place the color. Your crease is the area where your eye naturally folds. If you\u2019re having trouble finding it, press your finger lightly over eye -- the crease is right below the socket bone, above the eyeball. It\u2019s usually best to use a matte eyeshadow in the crease. While any mid-tone shade can work in the crease, a neutral shade, such as brown, gray, or taupe, is often the safest bet, particularly if you\u2019re wearing a colorful lid shade.

Nine Morrison\t\t\tBeauty Consultant\t\t\t\tChoose between an ombre look or a dark crease. Bridal beauty expert Nine Morrison says: \"To create a natural look, you can either get darker in the crease, or you can create an ombre effect by using a lighter color in the inner corner of your eye, then fade to a darker color toward the outer corner. The ombre shadow effect is flattering to any eye shape, whereas getting darker in the crease can be a drastic look that might not look as good on deep-set eyes.\""
