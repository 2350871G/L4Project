Then, gently pull away about 12.5 g (1 tbsp) of rice and mold it into a circular cake shape that is about 5.08 cm (2.00 in) in diameter. Use your fingers to press down on the rice and flatten it so it's thin, but don't press so hard that you make holes in the rice. Sticky white rice is best for this recipe because it holds its shape well. It's better to make your rice cakes thinner rather than thicker, because they will expand a lot during cooking. To make this process easier, you can press the rice into a simple circular cookie cutter or round mold."
