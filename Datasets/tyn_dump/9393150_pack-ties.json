Tuck the ties into a corner so that they don\u2019t move around or unravel. You can fit the ties in any snug fitting spot in your luggage or in zipped internal pockets if you have them. Folding Your Tie Slide the small end of the tie through the loop. Most ties will come with a loop on the backside of the front of the tie. Fold the tie over and run the small end through the loop so that the front of the tie is facing outward. Line up the top and bottom tips of the tie. Pull on both ends of the tie so that it's taut. The tie should be folded in half, lengthwise. The front of the tie should still be facing outward. Fold the tie again and run the smaller end through the loop. Pull the smaller end through the loop again, and make sure that both ends of the tie line up. The tie should now be folded over twice. Lay the tie flat in between 2 pieces of clothing. Position the tie on your pants, jacket, or shirt and put another piece of folded clothing on top of it. This will keep it flat and prevent it from becoming wrinkled. You can also put your folded ties in a tie box or ziplock bag. Purchase a tie case instead of storing your ties with your clothes. Tie cases are made specifically to store ties as you travel. Place your folded tie under the elastic straps inside of the case to hold them in place. A tie case is a more expensive option, but may be worth it if you're packing expensive ties. Packing Your Tie with a Suit Pack a tie with a suit if you\u2019re using a suit bag. If you are using a suitcase or a book bag, use one of the other two methods. This method is best used with a suit bag because, if you have to fold the suit to fit it in a suitcase, it may also leave fold lines in your ties. Put your suit on a felt coat hanger. Get a traditional hanger that looks like a triangle. The felt material will prevent the tie from slipping off. Put the left and right corners of the coat hanger into the arms of your suit, then use the hook to hold it up. Other materials like wood and plastic may be too slippery to hold the tie in place. Fold the tie over the bottom portion of the hanger. Thread the smaller end of the tie through the bottom part of the hanger so that the tie is folded over it. Line up both ends of the tie. Thread the small end of the tie through the loop to secure it. Push the skinny end of the tie through the loop attached to the back of the tie itself. This will keep the tie from slipping off the hanger or coming undone. Pack your suit in a suit bag. Place the suit inside of the suit bag and position the hook on the hanger so that it sticks through the hole in the suit bag. Then, zip up the suit bag and use the hanger to carry your suit.
