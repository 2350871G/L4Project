If you like smoother tuna salad, you can mix this up in the food processor as opposed to the bowl-and-fork method. If you like relatively dry tuna salad, you only need to add 1\u20132 tablespoons (14.8\u201329.6 ml) of mayonnaise. Be careful not to add too much at first. If you want more mayo, you can add more at any point. Use however much you like. If you don't like mayo, you can use any type of salad dressing or oil to bind together the tuna. Try using Italian salad dressing, or even just a bit of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Brown mustard also makes for a good mayo substitute in tuna salad."

Salt and pepper the tuna salad to your desired taste. Mix thoroughly. Onion and garlic make for good additions to tuna salad. Add a quarter teaspoon each of the dried versions for less potent additions, or chop up a small amount (half a clove of garlic, and an 1/8th of an onion) if you're into the raw version. Add whatever tastes you like. A pinch of curry powder and hot sauce can make for a spicy Indian style tuna salad, while some Parmesan, chopped green olives, spring onion, and dried oregano can be a delicious Mediterranean alternative. Experiment and find what you like."
