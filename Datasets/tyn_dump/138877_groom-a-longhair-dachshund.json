        "Look for any redness, flaking, or scabbing on the skin.",
        "Brush your dachshund\u2019s coat daily.",
        "Daily brushing helps to remove any loose hair that can get trapped in the dog\u2019s fur.",
        "Dachshunds have double coats, and longhaired dachshunds are more likely to become tangled and matted when they are not thoroughly brushed daily.",
        "Grooming Your Dog Trim inner ear hair.",
        "Longhaired dachshunds are prone to ear problems.",
        "The warm, moist environment inside the ear is a breeding ground for bacteria and yeast.",
        "If needed, use clippers to trim their hair on the inner flap of your dog\u2019s ear.",
        "This helps to prevent tangles, and allows for good circulation so moisture and dirt don\u2019t build up.",

        "Clean the dog\u2019s ears.",
        "Using a cotton ball and a dog ear cleaner solution, gently wipe the inside of your dog\u2019s ears.",
        "According to the solution\u2019s directions, place the correct amount in the ear and let it soak into the canal.",
        "Gently massage the base of the ear between your index finger and thumb for a few minutes, then let go and allow your dog to shake its head.",
        "This will help dislodge debris in the ear and expel the excess cleaning solution.",
        "Next, gently wipe the area around the outside of the ear canal to dislodge any wax.",
        "Check for any discharge from the ear canal.",
        "It\u2019s a good idea to check your dog\u2019s ears each time you groom it.",
        "Since dachshunds are prone to ear problems, this helps you catch conditions early on.",

        "Using toothpaste specially designed for dogs and a soft toothbrush, brush your dog\u2019s teeth.",
        "Gently hold back its lips so the teeth are exposed and gently brush each tooth.",
        "Ideally, you should brush your dog\u2019s teeth each day.",
        "Many dogs are uncomfortable with having their teeth brushed.",
        "Start by putting a small amount of dog toothpaste on a bit of gauze or a washcloth.",
        "Wrap the cloth around your finger and gently rub the toothpaste on your dog\u2019s teeth and gums for a few seconds.",
        "Gradually work up to using a toothbrush when your dog becomes used to having you manipulate its mouth.",

        "Trim the dog\u2019s nails.",
        "Your dachshund\u2019s nails are very small, so use a small dog nail clipper, not a regular nail clipper.",
        "Clip only the very tip of the nail, avoiding the quick.",
        "The quick is a vein that runs through the nail, and will bleed if nicked.",
        "Getting cut in the quick is also a very painful experience, and may cause your dog to be frightened of having its nails clipped again.",
        "It can be difficult to see the quick, especially with black nails.",
        "If you do happen to cut the quick, have a styptic powder and some gauze or cotton balls handy.",
        "This will help the blood clot and will stop the bleeding.",

        "Longhaired dachshunds tend to have very fuzzy feet.",

        "The products you use to bathe your longhaired dachshund should be specifically formulated for dogs.",
        "Use a high-quality non-detergent shampoo.",
        "Ideally, use a shampoo and conditioner that are fragrance free since these added chemicals can irritate your dog\u2019s skin.",
        "Hypoallergenic shampoos and conditioners formulated for dogs are good as well.",
        "Some shampoos are marketed as tearless, but you should always avoid getting shampoo directly into your dog\u2019s eyes.",
        "You can find quality pet shampoos online, at a pet store, or at a grooming salon.",
        "Wet the dog and massage in the shampoo.",

        "Starting at the head, use warm water to rinse the shampoo out of your dog\u2019s coat.",
        "Make sure that you get all of the shampoo out of its fur, or your dog may experience some skin irritation later on.",
