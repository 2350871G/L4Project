Producing a liquid culture will require you to incubate a bacterial sample overnight in an Erlenmeyer flask filled with lysogeny broth and the correct concentration of antibiotic. Once you\u2019ve prepared a liquid culture, you can put the bacteria into storage or proceed to isolate the plasmid DNA. Lysogeny broth (also known as \u201cLB broth\u201d and \u201cLB liquid\u201d) is a type of nutrient-rich fluid used to propagate bacteria rapidly. It can be purchased from a retailer that sells laboratory equipment and materials. Incubating bacterial cultures is a highly technical process involving many different variables. For this reason, it\u2019s best performed by a trained technician in a controlled laboratory setting."
