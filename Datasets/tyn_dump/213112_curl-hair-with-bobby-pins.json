                    "description": "When you are first learning this technique, start at the top so you can easily see your curls as you make them. Grab a section of hair towards the top of your head, and brush through the section from root to tip using either your fingers or a comb. Then, pull your hair taut and place your index finger on your dominant hand at the end of your hair. If you want to create larger curls, use bigger sections of hair. If you want to make tighter, smaller curls, use smaller sections of hair. Use your dominant hand to create your curls, and use your non-dominant hand to help guide your hair."

                    "description": "To start your curl, grab a section of hair and twirl it hair around your finger 2-3 times to secure the ends. Pinch the end of your hair between your thumb and index finger. Then, hold your hair 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) from the bottom with your non-dominant hand, and spin your finger clockwise so your hair tightly twists around it. Adjust your non-dominant hand as you go so it remains about 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) from the end of your hair. Be sure there is no space in between your finger and your hair. Your non-dominant hand acts as an anchor to keep your hair straight and taut as you spin your hair. If you are having trouble wrapping short hair around your finger, use a pen, marker, or mascara tube instead! This still creates the same basic curl shape, though it may be easier to wrap your hair around another object rather than your finger. Use an object that you can wrap your hair around at least 2 times. The length of your hair will determine how many times you're able to wrap it. The shorter your hair, the fewer wraps you'll be able to accomplish."

Once your finger is free from your curl, grab a bobby pin with your dominant hand, and slide it through your hair as close to your roots as you can get.
