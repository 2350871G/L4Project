Use a face mask to clean deep and soften skin. There are cheap face masks at your local drugstore. After you finish with the mask wash your face again and use a cleansing milk and toner. Last but not least, moisturize and prime your face with a good moisturizer and primer. Don't worry too much about the order you put them on, they will both set into your face in about 15 minutes."

For your eyes, eyeliner can highlight them and make it pop. Choose a good color, make sure you double coat your mascara and fill in those brows with color. As for your lips it depends on the clothes that you're going to wear. It's totally cool to go light if that's your style; but, just remember to be confident."

For the final touch, put on deodorant, and your favorite perfume and you are ready to go! Don't overdo scent."
