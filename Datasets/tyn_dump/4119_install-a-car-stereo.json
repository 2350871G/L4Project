If the stereo is held in place by screws or nuts, loosen them with the appropriate tool (screwdriver or nutdriver, respectively). If the stereo isn't held in place by screws or nuts, you'll need to use a radio-removal key. This tool is commonly necessary in Ford vehicles. Radio-removal keys (sometimes also referred to as radio-removal tools) will typically either be in an elongated horseshoe shape or will have a circular shape at one end and a notched shaft at the other. They\u2019re available at most auto-parts stores. Insert the keys into the two small slots in the face of the stereo. You will release a mechanism holding the stereo in place.

The wires are color-coded; however, the wires on an after-market stereo may not match with the color-coded wires in your vehicle. It's best to study and follow the wiring diagram that came with the stereo. Connect the matched wires. There are two options for connecting the wires, crimping or soldering. Crimping is faster and easier, but soldering will provide a more stable and secure connection. Be sure to use the proper size crimper and don\u2019t try to bundle the wires with tape \u2014 it will eventually dry out and fall off. Bundle wires using zip ties instead."
