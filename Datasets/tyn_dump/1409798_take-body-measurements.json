    "text": " Using a Tape Measure Use the correct type of tape measure. When taking body measurements, you need to use the correct type of tape measure. You will want to use a soft cloth or flexible plastic/rubber tape measure, such as is used in sewing. Do not use a metal measuring tape such as is used in construction (it will be inaccurate). Stand correctly. Stand straight, tall, and breathe normally when taking measurements. Some measurements may be taken better when exhaling, some when inhaling (it will depend on the purpose of the measurement). This may be difficult to do yourself, so get a friend to help you. Measure correctly. You want to be sure that when you measure, the tape is straight and in line with the appropriate body part. For example, for most circumference measurements the tape will need to be parallel to the floor while while lengths will need to be either parallel or perpendicular (based on the line orientation of the body part being measured). Wear appropriate clothing. You can\u2019t get a very accurate measurement when wearing baggy or thick clothing, so try to wear clothes which fit closely or wear nothing at all. Similarly, breast measurements for women will be most accurate when wearing a well-fitting, unpadded bra. If measuring for clothes tailoring, some measurements will need to be taken with clothing on, such as pants measurements and shoulder measurements. Know when to measure circumference vs length.

Make sure that you write down the measurements as you take them, so that you do not forget them and need to take them again. Monitoring Weight Measure your upper arm. Measure the circumference around the thickest part of your upper arm, usually at the bicep. Measure your chest. Measure the circumference around your chest at its widest point. For most men this will be at the armpits, for most women this will be at the nipple line. Measure your waist. Measure the circumference around your natural waist and your lower waist (two separate measurements). The natural waist is the smallest point of your waist (unlike where clothes\u2019 waistlines are located these days) and is usually an inch or two above your bellybutton.

Measure the circumference around your calf at its widest point, usually roughly \u00be of the way up from the ankle. Measure your weight. For weight monitoring, you may include your body weight as a body measurement. This measurement will need to be taken with a scale, either electronic or manual.

Measure the distance between the shoulder seams on an appropriately fitting shirt or jacket or the area you wish the shoulder seam to be. This measurement should be taken across the top of the back and be parallel with the floor. Measure your shoulder seam. Measure the distance between the seam or desired seam of your collar and your shoulder. Measure your sleeve length. Measure the distance between your shoulder seam and your desired sleeve cuff. This measurement should be taken in a straight line along the outside or top of the arm with the arm held up (parallel with the floor). This will help account for the fact that the cuff will move up the arm when the arm is extended, ensuring that your sleeve measurement is not too short. Measure your jacket length.

Measure your shoulder to nipple length. Measure the distance between your shoulder seam where it meets with your collar and your nipple line. This should align with the fullest part of your chest.

Measure your under bust using the method described in the clothing measurement section above. Add three inches to this measurement. If it is an even number then this is your band size. If it is an odd number, round down to the next even number to get your band size. Measure your bust size. Measure your bust at the nipple line as described in the monitoring weight section. The tape measure should just gentle touch you, not be pushing your breasts inward, and be parallel with the floor. If the resulting measurement is not a whole number, round up to the nearest full inch. Subtract your band size from your bust size. This should give you a much smaller number (usually between 2-4). This number is used to calculate your cup size. Here is how the numbers correspond:\n0-1/2 = AA\n1/2-1 = A\n2 = B\n3 = C\n4 = D\n5 = DD\nThis measurement system tends to be inaccurate for larger cup sizes and the system for your preferred brand should be followed.",

        "This should give you a much smaller number (usually between 2-4).",
        "This number is used to calculate your cup size.",
        "Here is how the numbers correspond:\n0-1/2 = AA\n1/2-1 = A\n2 = B\n3 = C\n4 = D\n5 = DD\nThis measurement system tends to be inaccurate for larger cup sizes and the system for your preferred brand should be followed."
