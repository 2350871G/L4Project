        "You don't have to do your lips or eye makeup yet, but you should do your primer and foundation first.",
        "If you want to set your makeup with setting powder or setting spray, do so now.",
        "If you apply either of these products after you apply the glitter, you risk removing the glitter.",
        "You can also skip the foundation and primer altogether for a simpler, fresh-faced look.",
        "Choose a skin-safe adhesive.",
        "Hair gel is a great, cheap choice for most people, including those with sensitive skin.",
        "You can also use a special adhesive made specifically for adhering glitter to skin.",
        "Aloe vera gel and petroleum jelly may also work.",
        "You can buy special adhesives for cosmetic-grade glitter online and in beauty supply shops.",
        "Pick a cosmetic-grade glitter color.",
        "You can use extra-fine glitter or even chunky glitter, but it must be cosmetic-grade.",
        "You can find this stuff online and in beauty supply shops; do not use crafting glitter.",
        "Think about how the glitter will look with the rest of your makeup and outfit.",
        "Choose colors that will go well with your overall look.",
        "For a more unique look, consider getting extra-fine glitter and body sequins/rhinestones.",
        "This way, you can layer the two together.",
        "Use a small makeup brush to apply the adhesive.",
        "Choose a makeup brush with stiffer bristles, such as a lipstick brush.",
        "Apply a thin coat of adhesive wherever you want the glitter to go.",
        "If you will be applying to glitter to both sides of your face, do just one side for right now.",
        "It is better to work in small areas rather than large ones, otherwise the adhesive will dry out too fast.",
        "You can do a random design, such as a streak, or you can do a specific design, such as a heart.",
        "You can even use stencils for something more intricate.",
        "Use the same brush to pat the glitter into the adhesive.",
        "Dip the brush into your pot of cosmetic-grade glitter, then gently pat it against the adhesive.",
        "Keep repeating this step until you get the glitter all over the adhesive.",
        "If you are working with extra-fine glitter, you may have to use a clean, soft makeup brush instead.",
        "Apply additional layers of glitter to create dimension, if desired.",
        "At this point, you can call it a day and go to show off your new glittered look, or you can keep adding more layers.",
        "Use a thin brush to add dots of adhesive onto already-glittered parts, then add skin-safe sequins or body glitter.",
        "Use an oil-based makeup remover to clean the glitter off.",
        "Soak a cotton round in an oil-based makeup remover, then wipe it across the glittered parts of your face.",
        "If you need to get more glitter off, use the other side of the cotton round."
