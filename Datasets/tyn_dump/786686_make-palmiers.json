Puff pastry can be bought at a store, and even pie crusts can be used in a pinch. Making your own puff pastry will always lead to better results, though it takes skill and time.

        "You should have a fair amount of it left over.",
        "Coat the top of the pastry with sugar.",
        "Both the insides and outsides of your cookies want to be covered in sugar, as it will caramelize as it cooks into a delicious, crispy golden-brown cookie.",
        "Be liberal with the sugar here -- coating most of the pastry with a generous dusting.",
        "Roll the two long ends towards each other, meeting in the middle.",
        "The final palmier will look like an old, stereotypical scroll.",
        "Using your fingertips, roll up the two long sides of the pastry sheet towards each other.",
        "You'll have a capital \"B\" shape if you did it well.",
        "You want a nice, tight roll.",
        "Start in the corner and work your way down bit by bit.",
        "It can help to alternate rolling each side, instead of rolling one side all the way to the middle and then starting on the other side.",
        "Cover the roll with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 15 minutes.",
        "Remember, you want the butter in the dough to be cold when the cookies hit the oven, otherwise, the cookies won't hold their shape and the dough will be dense and unappetizing.",
        "Preheat the oven to 450\u00baF and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.",
        "The sugar in the cookies will quickly stick to a hot baking sheet, so you must line the cookie sheet with parchment paper to ensure they don't crumble when removed.",
        "Remove the roll from the fridge and douse with egg wash and more sugar.",
        "Paint the top of the pastry roll with egg and then sprinkle some more of your sugar on top.",
        "Again, be generous here.",
        "More sugar is rarely missed in a good palmier.",
        "Slice the pastry roll across the width, making roughly 1/2\" cookies.",
        "Using a sharp knife, cut your roll into little rounds.",
        "You can choose whatever width you'd like for the cookies, all that is important is that they are roughly the same size, which will help them all cook in the same amount of time.",
        "Try not to smush the cookies as you cut.",
        "Use a sharp knife to slice gracefully through them.",
        "Brush the tops of the cookies with a bit more sugar and lay them down on the lined baking sheet.",
        "Make sure they are at least 1/2\" away from each other, or at least spaced enough so they don't touch.",
        "Drizzle a little more sugar onto the tops, focusing on the little rolls, so that they crisp and caramelize over.",
        "Cook the palmiers for 4-5 minutes, then flip and cook until golden brown.",
        "You want both sides to be a glistening copper color.",
        "The first side takes a little longer, usually 4-5 minutes, and the second side usually only needs another 2-3 before these guys are finished.",
        "Cool the cookies on a wire rack for perfect crunchiness.",
        "Wire racks allow the entire cookie to cool evenly, which prevents steam from getting trapped and leading to damp, less-crunchy parts of the palmier.",
        "After 2-3 minutes of cooling you can serve and enjoy!",
        "Making Simple Puff Pastry From Scratch Cut 20 tablespoons of butter into 1/2-inch cubes and freeze for 20 minutes.",
        "Cold butter is essential for a great puff pastry, as it creates pockets in the dough.",
        "As it cooks, the cold butter holds its shape initially, creating air pockets when the butter eventually melts.",
        "You want it to be almost hard, barely indenting under your finger.",
        "Combine 4 cups flour with 2 teaspoons of salt in a kitchen mixer.",
        "Place the paddle attachment on the mixer, then use a fork to lightly break up any clumps of flour.",
        "Add 7 tablespoons of softened butter and 3/4 cup ice cold water to the mixer and combine on low until everything is loosely together.",
        "It won't be a \"dough\" so much as a shaggy ball, but this is perfect.",
        "Resist the urge to keep mixing it, as this only makes the dough tougher.",
        "As soon as everything is roughly combined, stop mixing.",
        "Note -- this softened butter is not from the 20 tablespoons in the freezer -- this is separate.",
        "Add in the cold butter chunks and mix with your hands.",
        "You want a chunky, still-shaggy dough.",
        "The butter should still be in chunks.",
        "When done, turn the dough out onto a large piece of plastic wrap.",
        "On the plastic wrap, use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a 10-20\" rectangle.",
        "Square of the edges so that you have a nice, perfect rectangle.",
        "This size is relatively important -- you want it thin enough that you can keep working it.",
        "Wrap the plastic wrap around the dough and chill it for an hour.",
        "The hardest part of this dough is waiting for it to cool.",
        "This keeps the butter cold, again, to impart maximum flakiness on the final pastry.",
        "Fold the short ends of the rectangle in until they meet in the middle.",
        "Remove the dough after an hour and lay it out on a lightly floured work surface.",
        "Take either end and fold them inward, as if you were closing up two submarine sandwiches.",
        "There should be slight overlap in the middle where they meet.",
        "Fold the dough in half, hotdog style, so that you have four layers of dough stacked up.",
        "This is the first of your folds, which will create the flakes you desire in a puff pastry.",
        "These folds will actually hold up in the final cookie, which is why they seem so layered and flaky.",
        "Chill the folded dough for 15 minutes, then roll it back out to a 10-20 rectangle.",
        "As you roll the folded dough, you work these layers into the dough, with the hard butter helping the dough hold its shape and keep the layers distinct.",
        "Repeat the 4-way fold, chill for 1 hour, and then repeat 2 more times.",
        "You want to fold and roll the dough a total of four times, meaning the whole dough takes almost 5 hours to make with chill time factored in.",
        "This may seem excessive, but this literally creates all the flakes -- skipping it is not an option, as you wouldn't call it puff pastry dough if you did.",
        "Chill for at least an hour before using.",
        "Get the butter cold again before you start creating your palmiers.",
        "The good news is that, in the freezer, this dough keeps well, so you don't have to be in a rush to use it.",
        "Adding Some Variety Mix in some cinnamon, nutmeg, ground cloves, and/or allspice with your sugar to get a lightly spiced cookie.",
        "Want a fall-inspired palmier?",
        "Add some baking spices.",
        "For the perfect autumnal mixture, go straight to the pumpkin spice bottle, which is a pre-blended mixture of the spices mentioned above.",
        "Simply mix in 1-2 tablespoons of these spices (total, not each) into the sugar before spreading.",
        "Mix the spices on their own first, using your nose to determine if your ratio is to your liking.",
        "Use a bit of zest to get a fresh, bright punch to the cookies.",
        "You can use lemon, orange, or even limes to get a nice burst of acidic freshness in your cookies, and the sugar will ensure that they never get too tart or bitter.",
        "For an Asian-inspired twist, try a little freshly grated or candied ginger.",
        "Dunk half of the palmier in melted chocolate, letting it harden on.",
        "Melt semi-sweet chocolate chips in a double boiler, then dip the cookie in soon after it comes out the oven.",
        "To make a double boiler, fill a large saucepan with 1\" water on high heat.",
        "Place the chocolate in a smaller pot and place this in the water, which will more gently heat the chocolate than a straight stove burner.",
        "Swap the sugar for a coarse-grained salt and try out some savory palmiers.",
        "These delicate cookies aren't just for dessert.",
        "A little salt instead of sugar opens up a variety of savory options, for the \"filling,\" including:\nPepper and Grated Parmesan\nOlive tapenade\nPesto Try tea-cookie spices for an exotic, subtly complex cookie.",
        "You'll want a pinch each of orange zest, cardamom, chai spice, and vanilla bean added to the sugar mixture.",
        "Throw in a touch of cinnamon and enjoy the light, delicate results/"
