Instead, hang your bike on a rack or turn it upside down so it rests sturdily on the seat and handlebars. If you have a nice bike, you may want to lay a drop cloth in between your bike and the ground so you don't scratch its paint job. Bike racks are relatively easy to make from scrap parts. Make a stable frame equipped with hooks and hang your bike by its wheels. Hanging your bike in a rack or turning it upside down has the added bonus of making the chain more accessible as you work on it."

                    "description": "Take a look at your chain up close. If you notice warping, imperfections in the metal, or similar deterioration, you and your bike will be better off with a new chain. Surface rust, buildup, and crustiness can all be removed so your chain runs like new. To ensure the longest life and best operation of bike chains, avid cyclists should clean their chain once a week or roughly once every 200 miles (321 km). Keeping your chain cleaned and lubed will help maintain the condition of your chain and drivetrain. It will also help you notice damaged links sooner.

Jonas Jackel\t\t\tOwner, Huckleberry Bicycles\t\t\t\tExpert Trick: Measure the chain to determine when it's time to replace it. As the chain on your bike wears out, it gets longer, because there's more play around the rivets and rollers holding the chain together. Then, as the chain stretches and changes its shape, it will start to wear that different shape into the gears on your bike, so you'll have to replace the whole drivetrain if you wait too long to get a new chain."

        "Thread one end of the chain through the drivetrain so it meets its opposite end at the top or bottom midpoint between the wheels.",
        "Chain links should fit onto the points of gears and run smoothly through all component parts of the drivetrain.",
        "If you feel resistance, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ve inserted the chain improperly.",
        "If you find yourself really struggling to get the chain back in the drivetrain, look up a tutorial on YouTube or do a keyword search for your bike\u2019s manual online.",
        "Refasten the master link.",
        "Use your fingers to bring the ends of the chain together at the midpoint between the wheels.",
        "Slide the pin end-link into the slot of the opposite end-link.",
        "In many cases, you\u2019ll feel the link click into place.",
        "When properly refastened, the master link should align evenly with other links.",
        "If the master link is fastened unevenly, it could cause the chain to warp, ruining it.",
        "Check the motion of the chain.",
        "With the master link connected, you\u2019re finally ready to give the wheels a spin.",
        "The chain should pass smoothly through the drivetrain.",
        "If there is unnatural resistance or irregular noises from the chain (like groaning, scraping, or grinding), you may have reinstalled the chain incorrectly.",
        "Many small errors can be corrected with your fingers while the chain is still on the bike.",
        "In some cases, you may need to remove the chain completely and reinstall it from scratch.",
        "Lube the chain.",
        "A quality chain lube will protect your chain from further rusting and the buildup of grime.",
        "Position the nozzle of the lube above the midpoint of the chain.",
        "While squeezing out a thin, steady stream, spin the wheels of the bike.",
        "When the chain returns to its starting position, it\u2019s lubed and ready to ride."
