This following list should help you to determine the pectin content of your fruit harvest:\n\nHigh level of pectin: Cooking apples, lemons, blackcurrants, quinces, and green gooseberries. Medium level of pectin: Plums, cooking cherries, passionfruit, rhubarb, boysenberries, blueberries, ripe gooseberries, and raspberries. Low level of pectin: Strawberries, peaches, blackberries, figs, guavas, melons, loquats, eating cherries, apricots, tomatoes, and tamarillos."
