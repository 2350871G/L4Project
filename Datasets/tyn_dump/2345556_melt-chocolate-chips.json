        "You can heat the chocolate in thirty second intervals and stir as you go until you get the melted consistency.\"",
        "Continue heating the chocolate at 10 to 15-second intervals, stirring between each one, until it is almost melted.",
        "Milk chocolate and white chocolate tend to overheat quicker than dark chocolate.",
        "It would be best to stir them every 10 seconds.",
        "This may sound tedious, but it will reduce the chances of any scorching.",
        "Remember, chocolate will keep its shape when heated in the microwave, so stirring it up will help it \"melt.\"",
        "How long you end up cooking the chocolate also depends on how much you are working with.",
        "For example:\n1 ounce (30 grams) will take 1 minute total.",
        "8 ounces (225 grams) will take 3 minutes total.",
        "1 pound (450 grams) may take up to 6 minutes.",
        "Take the chocolate out of the microwave and continue stirring the chocolate until it turns smooth.",
        "Once the chocolate is mostly melted, take the bowl out of the microwave, and set it down onto a heat-safe surface.",
        "Continue stirring the chocolate, scrapping the bottom and sides of the bowl often, until it is smooth and no chunks remain.",
        "Use your chocolate.",
        "At this point, you can also add in any other extra ingredients that the recipe calls for, such as shortening or paraffin."
