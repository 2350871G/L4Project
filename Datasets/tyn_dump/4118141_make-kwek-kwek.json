        " Boil the Eggs Boil the eggs.",
        "Place the eggs in a medium saucepan.",
        "Add water until the surface of the water is 1 inch (2.5 cm) higher than the tops of the eggs.",
        "Heat the saucepan over high heat until the water starts to boil.",
        "Turn off the heat, cover the pan, and let the eggs cook in the hot water for an additional 5 minutes.",
        "It is generally recommended to bring the water and eggs up to temperature at the same time.",
        "If you drop cold eggs into boiling water, you may end up cracking some of the shells.",

        "This stops the cooking process and creates a barrier of steam between the egg white and the shell, which is why the shell is easier to remove as a result.",

        "If you do not plan on using the boiled quail eggs immediately, you should refrigerate them in a covered container until you are ready.",
        "They should not be kept for more than two days, however.",
        "Coat and Fry the Eggs Dredge the eggs in flour.",
        "Sprinkle 1 cup (250 ml) flour into a small dish with shallow sides.",
        "Roll the freshly peeled quail eggs in the flour until each one is well-coated all the way around.",
        "Note that you could also use corn flour when dredging the eggs instead of wheat flour.",
        "Corn flour has a lower gluten content, but otherwise, it will act the same way as the wheat flour acts and will adhere just as effectively.",
        "Mix the annatto powder and warm water.",
        "Dilute the annatto powder by mixing it into 3/4 cup (185 ml) warm water.",
        "Stir with a whisk until dissolved.",
        "Annatto powder is mostly used as a coloring agent, and when combined correctly, it should produce a deep orange color.",
        "It does give the batter a hint of flavor, though.",
        "If you do not have annatto powder, you can use orange food color instead.",
        "Place a few drops of orange food coloring, or a few drops of red and yellow food colorings, into the warm water and mix until you get a deep orange color.",
        "The food coloring will not give the batter the same exact taste as the annatto powder gives it, but the color should be about the same.",
        "Combine the batter ingredients.",
        "Mix another 1 cup (250 ml) flour, baking powder, and diluted annatto together in a large bowl, using a whisk.",
        "Combine thoroughly until there are no lumps.",
        "To improve the quality of the batter, set it off to the side for about 30 minutes before coating the eggs.",
        "Letting the batter sit allows the flour to become more thoroughly hydrated, creating a thicker, richer batter as a result.",
        "The resting time also gives the baking powder more time to activate.",
        "Be careful, though, since allowing the batter to rest for more than 30 minutes can cause some of the bubbles produced by the baking powder to escape, creating a denser, less airy batter as a result.",
        "Also note that the baking soda is not an absolutely essential ingredient.",
        "Some recipes leave it out completely.",
        "You could leave it out, as well, and the result will simply be a slightly denser batter.",
        "Coat the eggs with batter.",
        "Toss the eggs into the batter mixture.",
        "Roll them around gently until all sides are covered in batter.",
        "If you do not want to get your fingers sticky, use a metal skewer or a fork to move the eggs around as you coat them.",
        "It is crucial that all sides of each egg get coated.",
        "Heat oil in a deep pan.",
        "Pour 1 inch (2.5 cm) of vegetable oil into a wide pan with tall sides and a heavy bottom.",

        "Work carefully to avoid splashing hot oil when you drop the eggs in.",
        "Understand that the temperature of the oil will fluctuate once you drop the eggs in and once you remove them.",

        "Let the excess oil soak into the paper towels.",
        "A plate lined with clean paper bags will work instead of the paper towels, if desired.",
        "Alternatively, you could place the fried eggs in a metal strainer and drain the excess oil that way instead of using paper towels.",
        "It is best to enjoy the kwek kwek while it is still somewhat hot.",
        "The batter will be crispier when eaten fresh, but it can start to become soggy once it cools.",
        "Kwek kwek does not reheat well since the batter tends to get soggy during the refrigeration and reheating process.",
        "Make the Sauce Combine the ingredients in a saucepan.",
        "In a small saucepan, mix together the rice vinegar, brown sugar, ketchup, soy sauce, and black pepper.",
        "Stir until evenly combined.",
        "If you want a spicier sauce, chop up one hot chili and mix it into the other ingredients.",
        "If you still prefer a smoother sauce, though, you could accomplish the same level of heat by adding 1 tsp to 1 Tbsp (5 to 15 ml) chili sauce.",
        "Make this sauce as the eggs drain and cool.",
        "By the time the sauce is done, enough of the oil should have been drained and the eggs should be cool enough to bite into.",
        "You do not want to let the eggs cool down completely, though, since the batter will get soggy once that happens.",
