Along with liquid dish soap, you should scrub your Calphalon pots and pans with a non-abrasive sponge or soft-bristled dish brush.

Soaking the cookware will help the anodized aluminum release hardened food particles without the need for forceful scouring. Use hot water and leave the cookware to sit for 10-15 minutes, then hand wash as normal. For best results, add about a cup of distilled white vinegar to the bottom of the pots and pans before you soak them.
