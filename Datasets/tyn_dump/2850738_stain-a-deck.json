    "text": " Preparing the Deck Clean off all the furniture. The surface needs to be completely clear before you can stain it. Sweep the deck to remove any branches, leaves, pebbles or other debris. Check between the boards to make sure there are not small rocks, sticks or other items in the way. Look for any areas where wood has splintered or appears worn. These areas will need to be sanded before the deck is stained to make them smooth and bring out a brighter shine. Sand in the direction of the grain. Use a pole sander, which allows you to stand while you sand, or get on your knees and sand with a hand sander. Wash the deck with a deck cleaner. Cleanser can be found at hardware stores, home improvement retailers or department stores. Follow the directions on the deck cleaner you choose to use. Some will require you to wet the deck before washing it, others will want you to apply the product directly to the wood. Allow the cleaner to soak into the deck according to the instructions. Rinse the deck after cleaning it if necessary. Leave the deck to dry. Usually this will take about 2 days. Choosing a Deck Stain Look for a stain that is similar to the color of your deck, or a shade darker. Test the stain color in a small part of your deck to ensure it is the color you want. Check for a stain that is water repellent. It should provide waterproofing and protection from ultraviolet rays. Use a water repellent stain that also provides protection against mildew. Consider a semi-transparent stain if you want to keep the original wood grain visible on your deck. Many of these stains will also show the texture of your deck's wood. Applying the Stain Dress appropriately. To protect yourself, wear gloves, pants and a long sleeved shirt. You might also want to wear goggles or safety glasses to protect your eyes. Stir the stain in the can. You do not want any bubbles and you do not want to shake the stain. Use a bristle brush or a paint roller to apply a light, even coat of stain to 2 or 3 boards at a time. You will need a small paint brush in corners and other difficult places, such as steps or benches. Brush from one end of the board to the other, using long and even strokes. Spread the stain smoothly. You do not want it to puddle. Continue brushing or rolling the stain until the entire deck is covered with a single coat.  Leave the stain to dry for at least 3 days. Some people will put a second coat on, but this is not necessary. Bob Vila says that more stain is not necessarily better. If you apply to much, it can peel or crack.
