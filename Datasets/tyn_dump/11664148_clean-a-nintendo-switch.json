Get a clean microfiber cloth and roll it up so that it\u2019s wider than your screen. Gently brush the entire screen with your rolled-up microfiber cloth in one direction and motion. Repeat this process 2-3 times. This will remove most of the dust. In many cases, this is more than enough to clean the screen. Do this once every 2-3 weeks to keep dirt or dust from building up on your screen. You do not need to take the Joy-Cons out to do this. The Joy-Cons are the removable controllers that attach to the side of your screen."

Alternatively, you can run the cloth under a stream of water for 1-2 seconds and wring the excess water out.Warning: Never use any liquid other than water to clean your screen. The Switch, like other Nintendo products, is not designed to handle abrasive cleaners. Do not pour water over the screen. You can use a pre-moistened lens cloth instead if you prefer.
