Black tea works best for dyeing fabric because it has the deepest color. Teas that are light in color, such as white or green teas, don't work as well. You can also use loose tea to dye your fabric if you prefer. However, keep in mind that the process is less messy if you use tea bags. The number of tea bags that you\u2019ll need depends on how large the fabric you\u2019re dyeing is and how dark you want the fabric to become. You need to use enough water to cover the fabric, so the more water that you use, the more tea bags you\u2019ll likely need. In most cases, you can assume that you\u2019ll need one tea bag for every cup or 237 milliliters (8  fl oz) of water that you\u2019re using. Keep in mind that you\u2019ll want to add extra bags if you want your fabric to be a darker color."
