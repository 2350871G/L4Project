It will also give your teacher a physical keepsake to remember their old students by. If you aren\u2019t sure of your teacher\u2019s mailing address, then you might need to do some investigating. Some options to try for locating the address include contacting the school directly or contacting the alumni or local teacher's associations. If the teacher you\u2019re thanking is a high school teacher, then you can simply address the card to your teacher at the school\u2019s address, which will be available on the main page of the school\u2019s website. If you\u2019re thanking a former college professor, then things get a little trickier. You\u2019ll need to either call the office of the department in which your professor teaches to find out their specific mailing address or search the school\u2019s website to find out the address of a particular department. For example, if you want to thank your former Political Science professor, then you will need to call or search the website of that department to find the correct mailing address for your professor. Do not send the card to the general university mailing address, as that is for school administrators, not faculty. College faculty are often very mobile, more so than K-12 teachers, so they might not still be teaching at the school where they taught you. If this is the case, you can contact the department office and ask for a forwarding address for them."

        "High enrollments in classes are often due to positive word of mouth, and this tells your teacher that they are doing something right.",
        "Even though this is an indirect thank you, student interest in classes matters to teachers at the high school and college levels.",
        "Spreading the word that they\u2019re a great teacher will help them in this area and is a great way to show your appreciation.",
        "Stay in touch with them.",
        "Put some effort into maintaining a relationship with teachers you admire and learned a lot from.",
        "Send them an email on occasion or even stop by their classroom or office to see if they have a minute to chat.",
        "Staying in touch demonstrates the effect they had on you and your learning.",
        "Dedicate an accomplishment to them.",
        "This is especially applicable in college where you\u2019re likely to have a major project or paper as part of your curriculum.",
        "Usually you can dedicate these to someone of your choice.",
        "If you had a teacher who influenced your choice of major, specialization, or direction in college, then you might want to consider dedicating a college accomplishment to them.",
        "For example, if you had a History teacher, high school or college, who really got you interested in the Battle of Gettysburg and you end up writing your senior thesis or Master\u2019s thesis on that subject, then it would be appropriate (but not required!)",
        "for you to dedicate that project to them.",
        "This is a great way to show your teacher not only that you appreciate them, but also that what you learned in their class stuck with you over the years."
