You can also purchase them online if there are no mistletoe plants in your area. Fresh mistletoe berries are ideal for planting. You can trust they are ripe and ready to germinate, unlike older berries (or berries used in decorations), which may have already begun to decay. To identify whether a mistletoe berry is fresh enough to plant, check out the color. Look specifically for white berries; their pale color means they have reached full maturity. If you must use older berries, be sure to store them in water until you\u2019re ready to plant. You can submerge your mistletoe in a cup or vase. The mistletoe will also need ample amounts of light; set them near a window to meet this need."

Try to stick to branches with a diameter of eight inches. The mistletoe will mature more easily with eight inch branches.
