Look for a room that gets a lot of natural light if you\u2019re not planning to set up a lighting system. Make sure that the space is big enough for you to set up a studio. Use a room that has windows next to a wall so you can use natural lighting if you want to do so. If you choose to shoot outdoors, find a space that isn\u2019t too windy and doesn\u2019t have a lot of moving shadows."

Some products benefit from being shot under natural lighting conditions. If a product is meant to be used outside, then use natural lighting. Products that are meant to be worn by a person like clothing or jewelry should be shot in natural lighting because people look better in natural light.

The closer you are to the window and the larger the window is, the softer the natural lighting will be.
