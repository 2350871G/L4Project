This will make your juice tastier and more cohesive, and might even trick some people into thinking you're a professional! Strawberries, pineapples, and kiwis have very complementary flavors when mixed together. Carrots, beets, and apples are also tasty when blended together. Light, refreshing green produce like cucumbers, melon, pears, green apples, and leafy greens blend nicely if you want to make a green juice.Tip: You can incorporate supplementary ingredients like kale and ginger into pretty much any blend you want, depending on your personal preference."

If it's too sweet, your juice might be difficult to drink quickly, while too-savory juices can be a bit off-putting. Adding kale to your juice is wonderfully healthy, but it can create a bitter taste that is off-putting to most people. To counteract this bitterness and make the flavor more palatable, add sweet fruits like pineapple and juicy apples to the mix. If you want to make a root vegetable base with carrots and beets, you can add sweet fruits like apples to balance the flavor and sweeten the mixture. This trick also works great for smoothies that are a little too tangy or sour. If you want to balance out a smoothie that's already pretty sweet, try squeezing the juice from half a lemon into the mixture. For a spicy kick that can jazz up a bland smoothie, try adding ginger."
