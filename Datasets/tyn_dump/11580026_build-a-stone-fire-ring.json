Pick up the blocks one-by-one and set them off to the side. Make sure they are well out of the way so you have lots of room to dig and won\u2019t trip over them. Dig about 2 in (5.1 cm) down into the ground inside the outline. Use your spade to dig out any sod within the outline of the fire ring and down into the soil to create a shallow pit that is approximately 2 in (5.1 cm) deep. Try to excavate as evenly as possible so there are no spots that are deeper than others. You\u2019ll be able to level out the pit as you lay the foundation, so don\u2019t worry too much about getting it perfect at this stage. Fill the excavated pit with 2 in (5.1 cm) of paver sand. Pour paver sand into the site you just dug out and spread it out evenly with your spade. Compact it and level it out by hitting it with the flat side of the spade. This will create a solid, level base for the fire ring as well as help with drainage of rainwater. Paver sand is sand used in all kinds of masonry work to create level, solid surfaces on which to lay stonework as well as fill in gaps between stones. Check the levelness of the pit\u2019s foundation using a level. Lay the level across the compacted sand.

It\u2019s important to have a very level foundation for the fire ring so the stones align properly. Constructing the Fire Ring Arrange the first ring of stone blocks on top of the new foundation.

Don\u2019t try to put the blocks together extremely tightly, but rather leave narrow gaps between the inside walls of the blocks to allow for airflow. Good airflow will help the fire burn better and also let heat escape. The gaps can be about the width of a pencil or a little smaller. Use a caulking gun to apply masonry adhesive to the top of each block. Fit a tube of masonry adhesive into a caulking gun. Squeeze out a bead of the adhesive in a zig-zag pattern across the middle of the top of each block. The masonry adhesive will make the next row of stones stick in place and add stability to your fire ring. However, you can skip this if you want to. The stones are heavy enough that they will stay in place on their own as long as nobody pushes them or picks them up. Stagger a second row of retaining wall blocks on top of the first. Place the first block so it spans the crack between 2 blocks of the bottom row. Place the following 11 blocks around the rest of the ring in the same manner. Staggering the blocks makes the fire ring more stable as well as makes it more aesthetically pleasing. Add a third level if you want the fire ring to be higher.
