Pour the water in with the dissolved citric acid into the milk. Stir gently, and there will be some curdling. Making the Curd Heat the mixture until it reaches 88\u00baF (31\u00baC). Use medium-low heat. Stir occasionally to keep the milk from scorching. You can use a whisk, spoon, or heatproof spatula. The curd will begin to develop at this stage.
