Your chest should be resting on your thighs. Allow arms to lie limp at your sides with palms facing up. Relax in child\u2019s pose. Monitor your breathing and focus on silence for 30 seconds. Lift only your head while moving your elbows onto the ground in front of your knees.  Wrap a hand around each elbow without lifting your elbows off the floor.  Plant your elbows in this position. Never change this distance between your elbows throughout the duration of the headstand. Release the hold on your elbows and pivot your forearms forward so they are parallel to one another.  Bring your hands together and interlock the fingers. Your elbows and hands should form a triangle. Lift your hips up and forward so your head lands into the palm of your hands. Knees stay on the ground. Adjust your head so the top of your cranium is directly on the ground and your hands are resting in the back of your head. Do not move your elbows. Plant the balls of your feet into the ground and push so your knees extend up away from the ground and your body is lifted into the air. (Your body should form an upside down V). Slowly walk your feet towards your face. As you walk, your spine will straighten out above your head and you will notice your weight slowly shift from your feet to your elbows. When you can\u2019t walk further, push your elbows into the ground. Lift your feet into the air naturally as all of your weight shifts onto your elbows.  Continue lifting up your thighs until they are directly above your abdomen. Your elbows should hold a majority of the weight of your body, not your head or neck. Keep knees bent for now. Tighten abdomen. Remain in this position for 30 seconds. Focus on your balance. When fully balanced, slowly extend lower legs up above the waist. Point your toes.
