                    "description": "Wide ribbon makes a great sash and eliminates the need to sew as much. 2 yards (1.8 m) is enough ribbon for most adults, but you may need to adjust depending on the size of the person. Measure the ribbon on the person by wrapping it from their hip to their opposite shoulder and back down to their hip. You can always trim the ribbon if it's too long, so it's better to have more than you need than not enough. Choose ribbon in the color and texture of your choice. Tip: You can use wider ribbon if you prefer. For example, 4 inches (10 cm) wide ribbon will make it easier to add large lettering to the sash. Opt for a thicker, matte type of ribbon to ensure that the iron-on letters will adhere to the ribbon."

For example, if you have a 2 yards (1.8 m) long piece of ribbon, then you will need the same amount of trim to cover one edge of the ribbon, or twice as much trim to cover both edges. Try contrasting a red ribbon with some black fringe, or contrast a pink satin ribbon with some white lace."
