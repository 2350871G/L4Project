Let the oil begin warming, to the point that it is easily moved around the bottom of the saucepan when tilted. Any other cooking oil will work here, such as vegetable or canola, but it may not taste quite the same. If you don\u2019t like the taste of olive oil, use an oil that you enjoy instead.

Line the celery sticks up and use a sharp knife to cut them into chunks that are roughly \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) in width. Add the chopped celery to the pan with the onion, garlic, and oil.

        "Give the soup a good final stir to make sure all of the ingredients are well incorporated and combined.",
        "Reduce the heat to low and bring the soup to a simmer.",
        "Cover it and leave it to simmer for around 40 minutes, giving it time to thicken up and cook the beans.",
        "If you want a thicker soup, remove the lid after 40 minutes and let it simmer for a further 10 minutes.",
        "This will let more liquid cook off and result in a thicker, heartier soup.",
        "Finishing the Soup Blend the soup to your desired consistency.",
        "Once you\u2019ve given the soup enough time to simmer and cook, take it off the heat.",
        "Use a hand or stick blender to begin processing the soup and blending some of the beans and other ingredients.",
        "This will make it creamier and a little smoother.",
        "The more you blend your soup, the thicker and smoother it will be.",
        "For a thinner soup with more chunks, blend the soup for only a few seconds.",
        "Alternately, you can avoid blending it at all for a very thin and chunky soup.",
        "If you prefer your soup to be thick and very smooth, blend it until all of the beans have been processed and the soup reaches a creamier consistency.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a hand or stick blender, you can pour your soup in the jug of a standard kitchen blender to process it slightly.",
        "You may need to work in batches depending on the size of your blender.",
        "Add some milk or cream for some extra richness.",
        "If you want your soup to be a little richer or creamier, measure out roughly \u20442 cup (120 ml) of milk or cream and pour into the simmered soup.",
        "Mix it thoroughly to combine for a slightly smoother and richer soup.",
        "If you want to keep this recipe vegan, you can skip this step entirely.",
        "You could also use the same amount of sour cream or yogurt for extra thickness and creaminess.",
        "However, this will also impart the flavor of your chosen yogurt or sour cream into the soup.",
        "If you don't like the taste of sour cream, yogurt, milk, or cream, then leave them out of this dish.",
        "Poach some eggs in the soup for some extra protein.",
        "Once you\u2019ve blended the soup to your desired consistency, place it back over a medium heat and bring it to a simmer.",
        "Break 4 eggs into the soup so that they are spread apart and just submerged.",
        "Leave the eggs to cook, uncovered, for 5 minutes or until the whites are cooked and the yolks are runny.",
        "When serving, fill a bowl with soup and place the poached eggs onto it last.",
        "When you pierce the yolk, it will run across the soup, both looking and tasting incredible.",
        "Break the eggs, one at a time, into a small bowl first.",
        "Use the bowl to pour the eggs carefully into the soup.",
        "This will help keep the eggs together as you transfer them to the saucepan.",
        "Serve the soup with some fresh bread or warmed tortillas.",
        "Spoon the soup into a large bowl while it is still hot to serve.",
        "Eat it alongside some freshly cooked or lightly toasted bread, or opt for some tortillas that have been warmed through as an accompaniment.",
        "Once cooked, you can store the soup in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days."
