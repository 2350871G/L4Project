Clean your cleats with a scrubbing brush after they have soaked. Rub with the brush to remove mud and dirt that has been softened by the water. Dunk your cleats in the warm water after scrubbing. Dunking your cleats after using the brush will rinse off softened dirt left behind by the scrubbing brush. Cleaning Small and Sandy Patches of Dirt off your Cleats Remove the laces from your cleats. This will allow you to clean underneath the laces, and the laces themselves. It is useful to remove laces so that you don't miss small pockets of dirt. Check that the laces are clean. Most laces will be clean after being soaked and scrubbed. If your laces are not clean, wash them in the sink. You can lay the laces aside to dry with your cleats later. Scrub each cleat spike with a damp cloth. Pieces of dirt, mud, and rocks can get stuck between cleat spikes. Use a cloth to rub each spike clean, and get your fingers and the cloth into the small spaces between the spikes. Use a toothbrush to scrub between cleats on small-size shoes.

Going over the shoe multiple times will keep it looking new and smelling good for longer after you clean it. Rinsing and Drying your Cleats Rinse the outside of your cleats with clean water. Hold them under a tap, shower or hosepipe to wash off dirt, sand and soap. Clean up dirt and soap from the sink, tub, or backyard after you are finished. Rinse the inside of your cleats out. Pour water into your shoe and shake it out to clean sand from inside your shoe. Dry the outside of your cleats. Use a dry cloth to wipe your cleats and remove excess moisture from the outside of the shoe. Dry the inside of your cleats. Push kitchen towel, newspaper or a dry cloth into your shoe and count to ten before removing it to soak up moisture inside the shoe. Lay your shoes and laces out in a warm area to dry.
