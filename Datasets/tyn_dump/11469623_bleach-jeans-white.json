Use a dropper tool or spoon to apply about 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of the bleach solution to an inconspicuous part of your jeans, such as the inside of a hem or pocket, then wait about 5 minutes. The resulting color will tell you how well your jeans will react to the bleach, and what color they\u2019re likely to turn out. Use cold water only. Hot water will neutralize the main chemical agents in the bleach, essentially rendering it ineffective. Different garments are dyed using different methods. If your jeans were made with regular type of dye, it should be possible to bleach them to a crisp white. If they were colored with a fiber-reactive type of dye, you\u2019ll probably be able to strip most of the color, but may not be able to get them pure white."

If that\u2019s not an option, a deep bucket, wash tub, or solidly-built storage container with steep sides can make a suitable substitute.
