Don\u2019t overwet the leaves. Instead of running them under the faucet, try using a spray bottle filled with water to lightly mist them. For the best results, use freshly fallen leaves that aren\u2019t too dry or fragile. The vase looks best if you remove the stems from the leaves.

Next, press the leaves to the vase, smoothing out any air bubbles. Hold them in place for 5 to 10 seconds to give the leaves time to adhere. You can add as many or as few leaves as you like. Covering the entire surface of the vase with leaves creates a distinctive look, but having some space between the leaves can also be pretty. It\u2019s best to apply a single layer of leaves. If you try to place several layers on the vase, the leaves may fall off."

If desired, you can tie raffia or a ribbon around the neck of the vase to complement the leaves. Using ribbon that matches the color of the leaves creates an simple elegant look for the vase. However, a ribbon in a contrasting color can make a bolder statement."
