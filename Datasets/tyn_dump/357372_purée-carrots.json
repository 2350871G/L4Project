If you are making baby food, fill up an ice cube tray with the food. Wrap it with Saran wrap and place in the freezer until hard. Transfer the pieces into a container that can be placed in the freezer (Ziploc brand is a good suggestion).When you want to use carrot blocks, take out the amount you want & put the rest back in the freezer for later use.
