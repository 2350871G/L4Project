Try the shovel out before you buy it. Check that you can use it comfortable, especially if you have physical challenges. Consider getting a small snow shovel to dig snow out of smaller corners. Rock salt is not an effective snow melter. While it can melt snow, a shovel will move much more snow quickly. Rock salt and other ice melt treatments are meant for ice, and not effective for snow. If you need to remove snow do so physically. Rock salt and other ice melters can be devastating for your local water and soil, as well as your vehicles and sidewalk. If you must use chemical treatments on paved surfaces, use it only when necessary and only where needed."
