Biceps \u2014 With the arm extended naturally at the subject\u2019s side, take a vertical fold at the front of the arm, halfway between the shoulder and the crook of the elbow. Subscapular \u2014 Measurements of the subscapular area should be taken as a diagonal fold (calipers held at a 45 degree angle) across the back, just below the shoulder blade. Thigh \u2014 Take a vertical fold on the standing leg, midway between the kneecap and the crease where the thigh meets the hip. Iliac crest \u2014 Have the subject hold their right arm across the body. Use a horizontal pinch to take this measurement right above the hip bone on the side of the body. Abdominal \u2014 A measurement in the abdominal area should be a vertical fold one inch to right of navel. Calf \u2014 With the foot resting on a chair or platform at approximately 90 degrees, take the measurement as a vertical fold on the inside of the calf at the point with the largest circumference. Chest \u2014 Measure the pectoral region by taking a diagonal fold midway between the nipple and upper part of the pectoral muscle at the armpit. Axilla \u2014 The axilla area is on the side of the upper chest. A measurement here should be taken as a vertical fold directly under the center of the armpit and perpendicular to the nipple.

Some  highly recommended calipers include Harpenden Skinfold Calipers, Lafayette Skinfold Calipers, Lange Calipers, Slim Guide Skinfold Calipers, and Accu-Measure Body Fat Calipers. Administering the Pinch Test Choose a test. Pinch tests measure skinfolds at three, four, seven, and even ten points on the body. Taking measurements from more points does not ensure accuracy of the body fat percentage calculation. That depends on the precision used when taking the measurements and the formula used to calculate body fat. Identify the points at which you'll take measurements. The key is to be consistent with the exact locations as well as pinch-type (vertical vs. horizontal). In general, the right side of the body on a standing subject is used when obtaining measurements. Common areas to measure skinfolds include:\n\nTriceps \u2014 Have the subject bend the elbow to 90 degrees and mark the point midway between the top of the shoulder and elbow.

Making a \"C\" with your left thumb and index finger, grab as big of a skinfold as you can until it hurts, then pull outwards.
