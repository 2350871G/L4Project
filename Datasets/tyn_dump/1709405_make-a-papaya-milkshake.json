                    "description": "Taste the papaya before you use it in your milkshake, just to be sure, even if it was ripe when you bought it. There are three easy ways to tell whether a papaya is ripe without slicing it open:\nLook at the color. Unripe papaya is green on the outside. The skin of ripe papaya will be splashed with rich red, orange, and yellow hues. Some types of papaya grow yellow when ripe, and some grow red\u2014the important thing is that the fruit is not completely green. Squeeze the papaya gently. If it is ripe, the skin will give a little bit. If it is unripe, the fruit will feel hard and firm. If it is overripe, the skin will sag and the fruit may begin to feel squishy. Smell the papaya where the fruit grew from the stem. You should smell a sweet, pleasant scent\u2014nothing rotten or overly-sweet. This method may be most effective once you are familiar with the natural smell of papaya."

Papayas grow in Hawaii, Costa Rica, Mexico, Australia, South Africa, Ghana, India, and Peru, among other places. If the fruit grows in your area, pick it fresh or be sure to buy a ripe papaya. If it doesn't grow near you, try to choose fruit that's been imported from as close as possible to your location:\nTry Hawaiian Sunrise and Sunset papayas. These small-to-medium-sized red-orange varieties are known for being some of the sweetest papayas on the market. The Sunrise has notably shallow seed cavities, making seed removal much easier than with other types. Try kapaho papaya. This papaya grows in Hawaii and Costa Rica, and is known for a small-to-medium-sized fruit with sweet, yellow flesh. Try a Mexican papaya. Mexican papayas are much larger than kapaho papayas, and they can have either red or yellow flesh on the inside. The Mexican varieties are not as sweet as the Hawaiian papayas, and some say that they have a bland or bitter flavor. Mexican yellows are sweeter than Mexican reds, but still not as sweet as the Hawaiian breeds. Try an Australian variety. The Bettina and Pearson cultivars grow in Queensland\u2014the fruit are large with sweet flesh. Sunnybank and Guinea Gold papayas both grow in Western Australia, and they are characterized by their yellow flesh."

        "Chop off the top of the papaya around the stem.",
        "Slice the papaya in half, lengthwise.",
        "Remove any remaining seeds and fibers.",
        "Flip each half of the papaya over so that you can see the seed cavity.",
        "Use your spoon to scoop out any remaining seeds.",
        "Scrape away any white fibers for a smoother shake, although this is not strictly necessary.",
        "Dice the papaya into small chunks using a sharp knife.",
        "The chunks do not need to be regular or equally-sized.",
        "The smaller the bits, the smoother your milkshake will be\u2014but do not feel obliged to over-dice.",
        "As long as the blades of the blender can bite into the papaya and process it into the other ingredients, your milkshake should turn out fine.",
        "Making the Shake First, blend the papaya with honey.",
        "Put 1 cup of diced papaya (per serving) into a blender with about 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of honey.",
        "This may improve the consistency of the papaya extract before you add milk.",
        "Blend until the papaya is thoroughly blended and juiced.",
        "Pour the milk into the blender.",
        "You can always add more milk to adjust the consistency later.",
        "If you are supplementing or replacing the milk with ice cream or yogurt, you can add that now as well.",
        "Add your sweeteners.",
        "1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of honey, sugar, or another sweetener should do the trick.",
        "If you aren't sure how sweet you want your milkshake, leave out the honey/sugar until after you've blended all of the other ingredients.",
        "You can always add more of any ingredient to tweak the taste.",
        "Add any additional ingredients, to taste.",
        "Consider adding 1 1/2 of vanilla extract for a sweeter shake, or a pinch of black pepper for a spicier shake.",
        "If you aren't sure, you can always add extra seasonings after you've blended and tasted the basic shake.",
        "Make the shake.",
        "Blend all the ingredients for 1-2 minutes, or until the milkshake reaches a smooth consistency.",
        "Stop blending when you like the texture.",
        "Add the ice cubes.",
        "If you are adding ice cubes, add them once the milkshake becomes a puree, then blend for another 30 seconds.",
        "This will ensure that the ice cubes blend into the shake, but not so much that they lose their texture.",
        "Taste your papaya milkshake before you pour it.",
        "You can drink the shake as it is, or you can choose to add more ingredients to tweak the taste of the shake.",
        "If the shake isn't sweet enough, you can add honey, sugar, or ice cream to taste.",
        "If you are using a sweet variety of papaya, then you may just choose to add more papaya.",
        "If the shake is too sweet, you can add ice cubes, or milk to dilute the shake.",
        "Consider adding black pepper, if you haven't already, for a spicy twist.",
        "If the shake is too thick, you can add more milk to loosen the consistency.",
        "If the shake is too thin, you can add ice cubes, ice cream, or more papaya to thicken it up."
