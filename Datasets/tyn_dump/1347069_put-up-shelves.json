However, there are a couple important factors you\u2019ll want to consider when choosing a mounting site, such as proximity to the nearest wall studs and the size of your shelves in relation to nearby objects. If the shelves you\u2019ve picked out are especially deep, for example, it may not be a good idea to mount them near doors or high-traffic areas where someone might bump into them. A good rule of thumb is to mount display shelves at around eye level (5\u20136 feet (1.5\u20131.8 m), in the majority of cases) to enable easy access and make them a focal point of the room. If you're going to be stacking multiple shelves, it's best to do it in an area where you have enough room to space them about 12\u201318 inches (30\u201346 cm) apart."

Once it\u2019s in position, press the button on the thumb side to activate it and begin slowly sliding the tool to the right. When it flashes or beeps, it means it\u2019s detected a stud underneath. You can get a basic stud finder at your local hardware store or home improvement center for around $30. More advanced models with multiple modes and precision features may run you closer to $60-70. The term \u201cstud\u201d refers to one of the vertical boards that comprises the inner structure of the wall. It's important to locate your wall\u2019s studs anytime you\u2019re putting up shelves, as drywall isn\u2019t meant to support much weight and in time may collapse under strain.Tip: Ideally, you want to have at least 2 studs to stabilize your shelves.

A stud will make a dull thud when struck, unlike the hollow drywall, which tends to produce a louder, deeper sound. Light switches and electrical outlets are almost always mounted to a wall stud.
