Baggy, loose-fitting garments will hang nearer to the fire and flammable solutions, and may get too close for comfort. Long hair should also be pulled back tight or kept under a cap to keep it out of the way. If you have thick facial hair, be sure to keep your face a safe distance away from the flame at all times. In any controlled scenario involving fire, hair and clothing are a possible hazard. Keep the rest of your body a safe distance away from the hand that is holding the fire. Fabrics like cotton, rayon, and acetate catch fire easily and burn quickly."

Be careful not to leave any exposed spots or allow the skin to dry before lighting it. These types of fire tricks pose a relatively low risk of injury or mishap when executed correctly, but accidents may occur if you\u2019re careless or unprepared. Because of their high degree of flammability, gases like butane and methane burn extremely hot. Injury may result if any part of your skin not covered by the liquid solution is allowed to come into contact with the fire. For maximum protection, consider wearing rubber laboratory gloves when lighting your hands. It\u2019s not quite as daring, but you\u2019ll have a much lower chance of burning yourself."

Gases like butane and methane are lighter than air, so the bubbles will continue to rise and grow larger the more gas you add.

        "The bubbles and fumes from the gas will continue rising even after they\u2019ve touched your skin.",
        "This means that they\u2019ll catch fire as they\u2019re moving away from you, making the experiment safe.",
