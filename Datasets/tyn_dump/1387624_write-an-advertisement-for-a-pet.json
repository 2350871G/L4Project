For example, write something like this: \u201cHi, my name is Anne, and I\u2019m looking for a new home for my cat, Henry.

        "Ask for a rehoming fee to weed out ill-intentioned people.",
        "Asking for the rehoming fee ensures that the people who approach you are serious about adopting your pet.",

        "Check out some different sites to see what other ads look like, and modify your ad as needed.",
        "For example, if you\u2019re going to post your ad on a site that sells purebred golden retriever puppies, you\u2019ll want to include information about the puppies\u2019 pedigree, if either of the parents ever competed in shows, and details that showcase the puppies\u2019 breeding.",
        "Write short, clear descriptions to keep people\u2019s interest.",

        "Experts recommend keeping your pet\u2019s name off of flyers when they\u2019re lost, as people with bad intentions could use their name to gain control over them.",
        "But, you do definitely want to tell what kind of animal it is, the gender, size, approximate age, and some telling characteristics, like a crooked tail or a white spot over their left eye.",
        "There are sites that provide templates for \u201cLost Pet\u201d flyers.",

        "Center the photo on the page and make it fill up about half of the page.",
        "Avoid using a photo that has more than one pet in it.",
        "The simpler the image, the better people will remember it.",
        "Offer a reward if you can.",

        "If you can\u2019t afford a reward, that is okay!",
        "Lots of people put up flyers and have their pets safely returned to them without offering a reward.",
        "Make sure you receive your pet back safely before giving anyone any kind of reward.",
        "Provide a phone number where you can be called and/or texted.",
        "Double-check that your digits are written down correctly.",
        "Specify if it\u2019s okay for people to text you, too, or if you\u2019d prefer they call you directly.",
        "Also give your first name so they know who they need to speak to.",

        "Take flyers around your neighborhood and give them to people and put them up on posts wherever you can.",
        "If you\u2019re going to put up flyers on posts around your neighborhood, consider laminating them first so that they don\u2019t get soggy and disintegrate in inclement weather."
