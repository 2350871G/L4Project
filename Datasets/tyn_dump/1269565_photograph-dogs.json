                    "description": "Just like when photographing a person, you'll want the dog to look their best before you take pictures. Grooming the dog before you start can help them look clean, healthy, and happy in the pictures. Gather all your grooming materials beforehand and get to work: brush their fur, clip their nails, and clean any hard-to-reach areas. If this dog spends time outdoors and has matted fur, consider bathing them before you take the photos. Although grooming can be a hassle, you'll be glad you got them looking spiffy once the pictures are taken. Don't buy any grooming materials that you don't have. The dog does not have to look perfect, and you'll want them looking natural. Just groom them to their personal best. If you do not own the dog you're taking photos of, ask its owner to groom it well before the photo shoot."

If this dog is familiar with the area, they will be more likely to cooperate with you. Avoid choosing a background that will distract the dog: even a backyard can make for excellent photos. If you want action shots, consider picking a background outdoors. Dogs will be at their liveliest if they have lots of room to run and play in. If this is a personal photoshoot, consider a meaningful background. Ask the dog owner about special or personal spots if you do not own this pet."

Artificial light is better than flash photography, but if you can photograph dogs in sunlight, you will get the best results. Avoid using flash photography at all, if you can. You may think that night photographs will look cool, but dogs are likely to get redeye using flash lighting. If you take indoor photos, pose the dog near a window with lots of sunlight.

If they're quieter or shy, you could photograph them resting in the shade or on a relaxing walk. Photograph them in their element, and you'll be most likely to capture their personality. If you've never met this dog, get to know the owner beforehand and ask them to share information about the dog's personality. Keep the dog's physical traits in mind, too.
