In most cases, you should let your hair air dry for about 30 minutes. However, you may not need to wait as long if you have fine hair, and thick hair may take a little longer. Don't use a hair dryer to speed up the process because heat is damaging to your hair.

        "Add 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of 3% hydrogen peroxide.",
        "Measure the 3% hydrogen peroxide and pour it over the baking soda.",
        "You may notice it fizzing, but you don\u2019t need to worry.",
        "This is a normal reaction between the hydrogen peroxide and the baking soda.",
        "Since you\u2019re not using much hydrogen peroxide, it may not fizz.",
        "Don\u2019t use higher than a 3% hydrogen peroxide, as it may damage your hair.",
        "Stir the mixture with a plastic spoon until it has an even consistency.",
        "Use your spoon to break up any clumps that form in your paste.",
        "Keep stirring it until the ingredients are thoroughly mixed.",

        "Applying the Paste Do a strand test before you bleach your hair to see how your hair looks.",
        "It\u2019s best to do a strand test before you lighten your hair to see how the results turn out.",
        "To do a strand test, coat a few strands of hair in an inconspicuous area, such as behind your ear, with the hydrogen peroxide-baking soda paste, then wait 30 minutes before rinsing.",
        "This will show you how the paste affects your hair and the strands won\u2019t be visible if you don\u2019t like the color or if you have a reaction to the mixture.",
        "Based on your strand test, you can decide if you want to lighten your hair with hydrogen peroxide and baking soda.",
        "Additionally, it will help you decide if you need to use less or more paste on your hair to get your desired look, as well as how long you need to wait to see results.",
        "You will need to mix up more paste before you bleach your hair, as the paste you use to do the strand test will dry out.",
        "Expect your hair to lighten 1-2 shades.",
        "Hydrogen peroxide and bleach typically lighten your hair 1 or 2 shades, so you won't go from dark hair to blond.",
        "Keep in mind that it may bring out red, orange, or yellow tones in your hair, especially if your hair is dark.",

        "Make sure you apply the paste to all of your hair, as missed spots will be very obvious.",
        "If you have thick hair, then you will need to separate your hair into more sections to get even coverage.",
        "When you finish a section, comb through your hair to help distribute the paste in an even layer.",
        "Cover your head with a shower cap to keep the paste from dripping onto your body or your clothes.",
        "Additionally, the shower cap will trap in your body\u2019s natural heat, which will help the paste bleach your hair.",
        "Coat just your ends with the brush for an ombre effect.",
        "Start applying the paste on the ends of your hair, which will be the lightest.",
        "Then, bring the paste up the shaft of your hair, stopping part way up your strands.",
        "Don\u2019t try to stop the paste at the same spot each time, as this will create a blunt line that may look weird.",
        "Instead, vary your stopping point so that your hair blends well from dark to light.",
        "Apply a thicker coating of paste at the bottom of your hair, then thin it out as you get near the top of your bleached area.",
        "This will help create a better fade into your darker hair at the top of your head.",
        "Make sure to use vertical strokes to apply the paste along the hair shaft rather than horizontal strokes.",
        "Apply streaks of paste with an old toothbrush for highlights.",
        "Pick up a section of hair that\u2019s no larger than \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) across.",
        "Then, place a piece of foil below it.",
        "Starting at your roots, coat the length of the section with the paste, then fold up the foil to keep the bleached section separate from the rest of your hair.",
        "Continue to apply the paste to small sections of hair until you finish all 4 sections.",
        "If you just want to apply highlights to your top layer, then you don\u2019t need to worry about sectioning.",
        "However, doing highlights throughout your hair will make it look more natural, especially if you wear your hair up a lot.",
        "Leave the paste on your hair for 30-60 minutes.",
        "Check your hair after 30 minutes by wiping the paste off of a tiny section of hair in the back of your head.",
        "If you\u2019re happy with the color, go ahead and rinse.",

        "Then, let the conditioner sit on your hair for about 3 minutes before rinsing with cool water.",
        "The cool water will close your hair shaft and make your hair look shiny.Tip: You may prefer to use a deep conditioner after you bleach your hair.",
        "This can help restore some of the moisture you lost during the lightening process.",
        "Air dry your hair after you bleach it to avoid damaging it.",
        "Using heating products, like a hair dryer or straightener, can damage your hair, so it\u2019s best to skip them after bleaching your hair.",
