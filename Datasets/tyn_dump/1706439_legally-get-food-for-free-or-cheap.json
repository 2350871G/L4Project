SNAP cards are known as Electronic Benefits Transfer Card, or an EBT card. Not all grocery store purchases can be made using a EBT card. You can only use your card to purchase food or seeds to grow food to eat. Household items, alcoholic beverages, tobacco, vitamins, minerals, and hot foods cannot be purchased with an EBT card. To qualify for SNAP, you can have no more than $2, 250 in countable resources or no more than $3,250 in countable resources if at least one person in the household is over 60 or disabled. Countable resources include things like a bank account. Resources like a home or lot are not counted. The monthly income cut off to be eligible for SNAP is dependent on the size of your household. You can find a listing of income cutoffs by looking up the SNAP program on the United States Department of Food and Nutrition Service's website. In some states, farmers will match SNAP dollars at markets. For example, $1 in SNAP money will buy $2 in produce."

WIC is available in all 50 states. To qualify for WIC you must meet income guidelines, state residency requirements, and be declared at nutritional risk by a physician. Income requirements once again depend on family size and specifics can be found on the Department of Food and Nutrition Service's website. Qualifications for nutrition risk include medically-based risk, like a history of pregnancy complications or a condition like anemia, and dietary risks, such as inability to meet current dietary guidelines. The government also has a variety of child nutrition programs designed to assure children have access to food. School lunches are offered in many schools, and offered at a free or discount rate for low-income families. The Child and Adult Food Care Program offers free, healthy foods to children in daycare centers, after school programs, and emergency shelters.

They can be prepared a variety of ways, providing you with a diversity of meals at a low cost. Canned tuna sells for less than a dollar at most supermarkets. Tuna, like eggs, is a good source of lean protein and can be added to casseroles, salads, and sandwiches.
