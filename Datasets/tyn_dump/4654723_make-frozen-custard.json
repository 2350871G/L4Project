Heat over low heat, constantly whisking to prevent a skin from forming. Bring almost to a simmer, then remove from heat immediately. When it's ready, the mixture should coat the back of a metal spoon. The light corn syrup makes the end result denser and fudgier than a regular ice cream recipe that only uses sugar. You could use honey instead, but use a little less to avoid overpowering the other flavors."

You can stop once once the eggs are thoroughly combined with about half of the milk mixture. Alternatively, pour a small spoonful of milk into the eggs, whisk while counting to ten, and repeat. This is slower, but less likely to cook the eggs. Keep the bowl stable by placing a rolled-up towel around it. This allows you to whisk with one hand while pouring with the other. If you notice any bits of scrambled egg, strain them out and temper the rest more carefully."

Remove from heat once the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of the spoon, and leaves a line behind when you run a clean finger through the coating. If you have a cooking thermometer, bring the mixture to 170\u00baF (75\u00baC). Again, if you notice any lumps, strain them out before you continue. Remove the vanilla bean pod as well, if using."
