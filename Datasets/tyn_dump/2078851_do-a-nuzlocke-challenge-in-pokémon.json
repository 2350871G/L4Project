For example, if you are doing Nuzlocke challenge in Pok\u00e9mon LeafGreen or FireRed, you must choose between Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander. Bulbasaur is kind of a Special Attack kind of guy and is considered as an easy Pok\u00e9mon to start with. It can eliminate the first two gym leaders for that game, but that's for people who want an easy runner, or if they like Bulbasaur because they find it enjoyable. Squirtle is a normal runner, which develops good defense other than the rest of the stats to begin with. Squirtle can take out Brock (first Gym Leader) and make it neutral to beat Misty (second Gym Leader). Charmander is the hardest to start out with. It has good special attack and speed to begin with, but it will have some trouble between Misty, Brock, and is neutral to Lt. Surge (third Gym Leader). Charmander can be chosen by people who feel like they want a good challenge."

As you can see, poison will bother you in the game, so stock up on Antidotes just in case your Pok\u00e9mon is poisoned and it will die by the time you reach the Pok\u00e9mon Center. Other status healers are recommended also, Antidotes are just the items to save you. Revives and Max Revives will be useless when you are going to run through this challenge, since you can't resurrect your dead Pok\u00e9mon. TMs and HMs are important if you have a Pok\u00e9mon with a poor move pool. In Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon, there are no HMs, only TMs, so you won't have to go to a Move Deleter to get rid of HMs you don't want on your Pok\u00e9mon."
