        "Cook your buns for 20-25 minutes at 400F, or until golden brown.",
        "Once the tops are gorgeous and golden, you can take them out.",
        "If the tops aren't quite dark enough, but the fruit is starting to burn, simply cover the entire pan of buns with a sheet of aluminum foil for the last few minutes.",
        "Apply your glaze right out of the oven, then eat while still hot.",
        "Chelsea buns, like most other quick, risen breads, are best the day they are baked.",
        "Be sure to choose your favorite sweet glaze and apply it while they are still hot.",
        "Don't feel like glazing?",
        "Simply dust with powdered sugar and serve!",
        "Making Icings and Glazes Try a simple, classic royal icing for a traditional treat.",
        "All you need is water, icing sugar, and an egg white also known as powdered sugar.",
        "You can blend these up into a wonderfully light, but delicious, icing in no time.",
        "Simply beat the following together with a wooden spoon until completely blended:\n2 cups icing sugar\n1 egg white (or powdered egg white equivalent)\n1/2 teaspoon water.",
        "Try out a creamy milk-sugar glaze.",
        "This icing has a slightly more intense flavor, taking on notes of toffee if cooked for long enough.",
        "To make it, simply warm 2 tablespoons of milk on low heat, mixing in 2 tablespoons of sugar until dissolved.",
        "Spread over warm buns immediately with a kitchen brush or the back of a spoon.",
        "If you have demerara sugar, which is extra large and crunchy, sprinkle it over this glaze for a little punch of crunch and sweetness.",
        "Make a light orange or lemon glaze to complement the sweet-spice combination of the buns.",
        "This is more and more common in English bakeries and takes no more than a bit of zest.",
        "You can choose either icing recipe listed above this step, simply grating in 1/2 teaspoon of orange or lemon zest to get a light, but decadent, citrus flavor.",
        "Dust with powdered sugar right out of the oven for a simple, easy glaze.",
        "If applied early enough, the sugar will likely start to melt slightly, as it is so fine it doesn't need much heat to dissolve.",
        "This can lead to a light, simple, and instant glaze without dirtying any other dishes.",
        "Glaze them with an improvised glaze of your favorite jam, such as apricot.",
        "This sugary, fruity glaze goes incredibly with the bun and dried fruit, especially if added while the buns are still hot.",
        "While any jam will work, the slightly tart bite of apricot jam is particularly heavenly.",
        "If the jam is hard to spread, even over the hot buns, add a splash of water and microwave for 10-15 seconds, until smooth and spreadable.",
        "Sampling Variations Try spicing the dough, instead of just the filling.",
        "This can lead to a much more nuanced bun, and prevents overly strong bites of spice by more evenly distributing it throughout the entire bun.",
        "Remember when spicing to smell your spice mixture before adding -- if it smells good, it will likely taste good, too.",
        "To spice the dough, simply whip up your dough like normal, adding the following to the dough after the milk and egg:\nZest of 1 lemon\n1 tsp pumpkin pie spice or mixed spice (combine cinnamon, nutmeg, ground cloves, allspice, and/or cardamom).",
        "Adjust the sugar in the recipe to get more savory or sweet treats.",
        "Remember that you do need some sugar -- at least 1 teaspoon, to help feed the yeast.",
        "That said, how much sugar you add is largely up to you.",
        "Want more \"spiced,\" less sugary buns?",
        "Stick to just a teaspoon.",
        "But equally correct are sweeter dessert buns, which can take 2\u20133 tablespoons (29.6\u201344.4 ml) of sugar.",
        "There are many recipes on the internet, but the basics are easily adjusted to change the exact flavor you want.",
        "Try using more butter for an even richer dough.",
        "Butter leads to denser, but richer, doughs.",
        "There are recipes that call for as much as 8 melted tablespoons of butter in the total recipe, 5 in the dough and three for the filling.",
        "If you want something just a bit more decadent, try throwing in 1-2 extra tablespoons of butter when warming the milk.",
        "Mix up the dried fruit that you use in the center.",
        "While currants are the most common fruit for a Chelsea bun, they aren't your only option.",
        "Other popular fruits include:\nRaisins\nCraisins\nSultanas\nDried apricots (cut small)\nDried cherries Consider mixing the fruit into the dough, not the rolls.",
        "This may cause them to lose some of their spiral shapes, but it ensures that the fruit doesn't burn, as well.",
        "Simply add the dried fruit in after the dough is almost done mixing and bake like normal."
