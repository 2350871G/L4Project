    "text": " Making the Nose Cone Draw a circle on your paper. You\u2019ll use this to form the rocket\u2019s nose cone. A streamlined and pointy nose cone will really increase your paper rocket's aerodynamics. Place your plastic cup on a clean area of the paper, bottom side down. Trace around the bottom to make a perfect circle. Make a small dot in the center of the circle. Draw a small triangle with the tip ending at the circle. It should look like a slice of pie that is about 1/8th the size of the circle. Cut out the entire circle. Go slow and steady and try to keep it as a perfectly round circle. Make a cone out of the circle. These next steps will help you turn your circle into a cone. Cut out the triangle piece. Now your circle will look like Pacman. Fold down the right and left flaps to form a cone. It will look kind of like a teepee or a party hat. Hold it on the top and bottom with two hands and twirl it around in your finger to turn it into a pointy cone. Use tape to seal the cone. One piece should be enough to hold the seams in place and keep your cone tight, like a dunce cap or ice cream cone. Attach your cone the body. Now that you have both the rocket body and nose cone, it\u2019s time to put them together. Put the cone on one of the rocket ends and tape them together. It\u2019s okay if the cone is a little bigger than the body, just make sure you mold it tightly around the cylinder and tightly seal it with tape. You can test the seal by blowing into the open end of the cylinder. If some air leaks out, use more tape to seal it up. Making the Rocket Body Draw a 5x5 inch square. This will be as the body for your rocket. It's best to use regular 8x11 computer printer paper. Start at the left side of your paper and make a dot at the 5-inch mark. Next, measure 5 inches from the top of the paper and make a mark there. Draw lines to connect these points and form a square in the top left corner. Take your time, there\u2019s no rush.

Making the Wings Drawing a pair of 2x1 inch triangles. To draw a triangle, all you have to do is draw a 2 inch vertical with your ruler, and then a 1-inch horizontal line from its base, and connect the opposite ends with a diagonal line. Cut out the triangles. You might want to use a smaller pair of scissors for this part. Tape one your triangles to the cylinder body.

Tape your second wing in the same way, directly across from your first wing. Flying the Rocket Insert the straw. Take your plastic drinking straw and insert it into the open end of your rocket. Aim. Be careful not to point your rocket at anybody, and especially not anyone\u2019s face. Instead, make a target and aim for that. How to Make a Target Blow. Take a deep breath in and exhale quickly and forcefully through the straw. Blastoff! Watch as your homemade paper rocket blasts through the air.",
