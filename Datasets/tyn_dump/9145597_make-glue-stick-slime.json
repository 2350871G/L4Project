        "Remember, you can always add more contact lens solution later.",
        "If you can\u2019t find contact lens solution, try \u201csaline solution\u201d instead.",
        "Stir the solution until it turns into slime.",
        "This is where the magic happens!",
        "At first, the mixture won\u2019t look like much, but the longer you stir it, the more putty-like it will become.",
        "This can take a few minutes, however, so get stirring!",
        "Again, there may be a few chunks of glue left in the putty.",
        "Don\u2019t worry; you\u2019ll knead these out in the next step.",
        "Knead the slime for a few minutes, focusing on the chunks.",
        "Depending on how many chunks there are, this can take anywhere from 2 to 3 minutes.",
        "The more you knead the slime, the more putty-like it will become.",
        "As you knead it, press those little chunks of glue between your fingers.",
        "You may not be able to get all of the chunks out; just try to squish them out as best as you can.",
        "When finished, this slime will be more like silly putty than traditional gak slime."
