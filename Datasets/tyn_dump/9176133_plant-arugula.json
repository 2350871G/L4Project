Find a spot in your garden that gets a lot of direct sunlight throughout the morning and is a little more shaded in the afternoon. Enrich the garden soil with organic material.

If your garden soil seems to be retaining too much moisture, add organic material or perlite to the soil, which can improve drainage. Rake the dirt. Gently rake the garden soil so that it's even and free of any big rocks, sticks, or dirt clods. Make sure to rake an area that measures at least about 2 feet (0.6 m) by 3 feet (0.9 m). Make small holes about 15 inches (38 cm) apart. Use a small gardening hand shovel to dig as many holes as you have seedlings. Make them about as deep as the cells are. Each hole should be 14-16 inches (36-41 cm) away from the others. Transplanting the Seedlings Water the seedlings. Water the seedlings in their cells just before transplanting them. This will make the transition easier. Flip the container and pull the seedlings out. Slowly and carefully turn the cell container upside down. Gently pull the seedlings out without damaging them or separating them from the soil. Put the seedlings in the holes. Put the seedlings into the holes you dug so that the surface of the soil matches up. Push some garden soil in towards each plant to make sure gaps are filled and the seedlings are supported. Water the garden. Finally, water the seedlings again once they're all transplanted. Your arugula should be ready to harvest in 30-40 days once the leaves are about 4 inches (10.2 cm) long. Harvest your arugula. You can harvest your plants gradually or all at once. If you are continuously planting seeds, your crop can continue all summer.
