If you want to add a point to the bottom of the skull cap, draw upward arches coming from the ends of the slanted lines. The ends of the arches will form a point in the middle of the cap. Make a small oval in the middle of the rhombus for the button. The board of a graduation cap usually has a button that holds the tassel in place.

Making a Graduation Cap from Below Make a horizontal oval near the bottom of your paper. Start in the middle of your paper so you have room to draw the top of the cap later on. Draw a narrow, horizontal oval so the center of the page lines up with the center of the shape. The oval will be the bottom of the skullcap where you put your head.

Draw 2 slightly angled vertical lines coming up from the ends of the oval. Begin your line on the left side of the oval, and extend it up at a slight angle toward the center. Make the line so it\u2019s about half the length of the oval so it doesn\u2019t extend too tall. Make another slanted line coming up from the right side of the oval to form the other side of the skullcap. Draw your lines so they\u2019re the same length, or else the graduation cap won\u2019t look correct when you\u2019re finished. Sketch in a curved line on top to finish the skullcap. Put your pencil on the end of the slanted line on the left side, and draw an upward arch so the highest point lines up with the center of the oval. Curve the line back down so it connects with the end of the slanted line on the right. The shape of the skull cap will look like a cylinder with a slightly wider bottom when you\u2019re done. Draw 2 diagonal lines coming out from the sides of the cylinder. Begin on the left side of the skullcap so you\u2019re about a third of the way down from the top.
