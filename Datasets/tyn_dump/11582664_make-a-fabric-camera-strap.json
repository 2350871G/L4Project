                    "description": "Use a measuring tape and a pen or other writing tool to mark off the dimensions of your new camera straps. Use a 32 in (81 cm) measurement if you\u2019d like a strap that fits comfortably around your neck. If you\u2019d like a thicker strap, feel free to mark off more than 4 in (10 cm). Since you\u2019ll be folding your fabric in half vertically, double the measurement of your desired strap width. If you follow these exact measurements, your finished camera strap will be 2 in (5.1 cm) wide. For instance, if you\u2019d like your finished camera strap to be 3 in (7.6 cm) wide, measure and mark your fabric to be 6 in (15 cm). While there are no hard and fast rules for making a camera strap, you might have an easier time working with lighter fabrics, like cotton."

        "String a sewing needle with durable thread, and sew both folds of the end piece to the fabric strap.",
        "Work in small, consistent stitches, so the sewing job looks even all round the end piece.",
        "Once you\u2019ve connected both halves of the curved rectangle together, tie off the thread and trim away any excess.",
        "Don\u2019t worry if your stitches aren\u2019t perfect.",
        "The main purpose is to  provide structure to your camera strap.",
        "If you don\u2019t want the thread to be obvious, choose a color that matches the material of your end pieces.",
        "If you\u2019d like the stitching to stand out, use a more obvious color like black or white.",
        "Stitch an boxed \u201cX\u201d in the middle of the end piece to make it secure.",
        "Re-thread your needle and begin sewing in the center of your end piece.",
        "First, stitch a rectangle in the center of your end piece.",
        "Next stitch in diagonal lines from corner to corner of this rectangle, creating an \u201cX\u201d inside of a box.",
        "As you did before, tie off the thread and trim away any of the extra.",
        "This type of stitching is seen on a lot of garments, and it helps provide stability to different sewing projects.",
        "Your rectangle and \u201cX\u201d don\u2019t have to be perfect\u2014they just have to keep your end piece secured.",
        "Repeat this process with the opposite end piece and strap.",
        "Fold the other section of your end piece material around the loop, chain, or buckle of the metal clasp.",
        "After folding the vinyl or faux leather material in half and sliding it onto the other end of the strap, use a needle and thread to hand stitch the different components together.",
        "As a finishing touch, sew in the same \u201cX\u201d and rectangle into the center of the other end piece.",
        "While your end pieces might not look identical, they should look relatively similar.",
        "Clip both ends of the strap to your camera.",
        "Take the clasps attached to both ends of your strap and fasten them to the strap loops on your camera.",
        "Depending on the size of your metal hooks or clasps, you might not be able to fit your large hook around the loop.",
        "If this is the case, slide a metal ring onto each of these camera loops, and attach the metal hooks to these loops.",
        "Before going out with your camera, place the strap around your neck to see if it feels comfortable.",
        "If the material feels scratchy or weird, you might want to re-do or adjust the project with a different fabric."
