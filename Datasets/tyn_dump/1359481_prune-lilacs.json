So don't feel guilty or wasteful when you go outside with your hand trimmers to take off the prettiest flowers - you're doing just the right thing for your lilac bush or tree. Another term for this type of pruning is deadheading. In addition to pruning flowers just past their peak, prune those that are already dying. Make the cut just at the base of the flowers. You can disinfect your tools before you prune to avoid spreading disease to your lilac bush. Simply wipe it down with a disinfectant spray or rubbing alcohol."

Doing so will help the lilac keep its pretty shape. The process of cutting back the stems a bit is called tipping off. Use a hand clipper to cut longer stems back to the next closest pair of side shoots. This means you'll be trimming the stem back beyond the flowered part, and all the way down to where side shoots are growing off. If A long stem doesn't have side shoots closer to the base, trim it back to the closest node or bud, where new shoots will sprout. Tipping encourages lilacs to sprout new healthy, bushy growth near the cut."
