Stripping anodization requires the use of a caustic chemical and it will undoubtedly weaken the metal surface. With this in mind, the only reason to strip anodization is if you like the look of bare metal. Unless you love the way bare metal looks, there\u2019s no real reason to do this. If you\u2019re stripping the anodization on a screw, bearing, nut, or computer part, recognize that there\u2019s probably a reason the part was anodized in the first place. Unless the object is purely ornamental, you\u2019re probably better off leaving it the way it is."
