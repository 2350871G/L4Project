Bring the water and elderberries to a boil. Put the prepared elderberries into a large stockpot and pour in 6 cups (1,400 ml) of water. Put the lid on the pot and turn the burner to high heat.

Keep the lid on the pot and simmer the elderberries until they become soft. Dried elderberries will probably need the full 45 minutes to become soft while fresh elderberries may be done after 40 minutes. Blend the elderberries. Turn off the burner and use an immersion blender to combine the elderberries with the water until the elderberries are completely smooth.

Keep the elderberries warm while you make the thickening cornstarch slurry. Mix the cornstarch with water and whisk it into the elderberries. Put 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) (8 g) of cornstarch into a small bowl and stir in 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of cold water. Stir until the cornstarch dissolves and then whisk it into the elderberries. Bring the elderberry soup to a boil and stir in the apples and lemon zest. Whisk the soup frequently as it begins to bubble and thicken. Then peel and dice 2 cups (235 g) of tart apples.
