                    "description": "Tension shower rods are inexpensive, easy to find, and require no tools or hardware. They rely on the tension of your shower\u2019s walls to remain stable and can be easily adjusted or moved. When looking at a tension rod, make sure that the maximum length exceeds the distance between your bathroom\u2019s walls. Purchase a tension shower rod online or at your local home supply store.Tip: The standard length of a tub is 60 inches (150 cm), and most tension rods extend from 48\u201375 inches (120\u2013190 cm). You shouldn\u2019t have a problem installing a tension rod unless your shower is abnormally large or small. If you\u2019re renting, get a standard tension rod. Mountable shower rods often require drilling into the tile in the bathroom. Tension shower rods come preassembled, which makes installation easy. It shouldn\u2019t take more than 5 minutes to install a tension shower rod."
