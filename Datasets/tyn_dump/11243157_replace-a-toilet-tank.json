Contact your local waste management facility to find out how to properly dispose of your tank. You do not need to save the flush mechanisms from your old tank since the new tank will come with them. Installing the New Tank Get a tank that matches the size of your toilet bowl\u2019s gasket. The toilet gasket is the main hole where water travels from the tank into the bowl. Measure the size of the gasket on your toilet bowl with a tape measure so you can buy a tank that has the same size hole. Make sure the color of the tank matches the bowl or else your toilet won\u2019t look cohesive. Many hardware or plumbing stores have universal toilet tanks that you can use on any type of bowl.

Push the gasket onto the largest hole on the bottom of the tank so it forms a tight seal. If your tank doesn\u2019t come with a tank-to-bowl gasket, then you can buy one that\u2019s the same size as the toilet tank\u2019s hole from your local hardware store. Slide a rubber washer onto each of the tank bolts. Your tank will come with all the bolts and washers you need to install it on your bowl. Find the rubber washers provided with the tank and push 1 onto each bolt. Make sure the washer is pressed tightly against the top of the bolt so it forms a seal and prevents leaks. Some toilet tanks may have large rubber pieces that you push into the holes on the bottom of your toilet tank rather than use rubber washers. Consult with your tank\u2019s installation manual to see if any pieces install differently. Set the tank on top of the toilet bowl so the holes line up with one another.

Be careful not to move the tank around too much after you set it on the bowl so you don\u2019t accidentally scratch either piece.

Some tanks have another set of rubber washers you need to put onto the bolts after you place them through the tank. Not every toilet tank will have another set of washers. Tighten a nut onto each bolt to hold the tank in place and make it level. Guide a washer onto each of the bolts from underneath the tank so you don\u2019t damage or crack it.

If the nut is difficult to turn, don\u2019t try to force it any tighter. Filling the Tank Clip the refill hose to the top of the flush valve. The refill hose is a small plastic tube inside the tank attached to the top of the flush mechanism. Locate the refill hose and clip it onto the side of the flush valve, which is the tall column in the middle of your toilet tank or on the right side of your tank. Check the installation manual for your tank to see exactly how it attaches to the model you\u2019re using. Every refill hose and flush valve will connect differently depending on the tank you have. Screw the supply hose onto the bottom of the tank. Take the end of the supply hose and find the port on the bottom of the tank where it connects.
