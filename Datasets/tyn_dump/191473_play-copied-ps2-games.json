Swap Magic is commonly found at independent gaming or computer repair shops. You can also purchase it online, but make sure you buy it from a reputable place, such as Amazon. You\u2019ll need to buy CD/DVD copies of the software, as burning your own copy will not work. Any site that demands payment for a download of Swap Magic is likely a scam. Only buy software from sites you trust. Swap Magic 3.8 also allows you to play games that are not rated for your country. Make sure you know the laws before playing games that aren\u2019t designed for use in your area."
