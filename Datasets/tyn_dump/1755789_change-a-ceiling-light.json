        "Connect the same-colored wires by twisting them together.",
        "Both the ceiling wires and light fixture wires feature color-coded insulation.",
        "A traditional color scheme includes black, white, and green wires.",
        "All you have to do is color match the wires.",
        "To tie them together, hold the exposed ends side by side, then use your other hand or lineman's pliers to twist them around twice.",
        "In a standard electrical coloring scheme, black and red wires are hot wires, white wires are neutral wires, and green or bare copper wires are ground wires.",
        "Consult the owner\u2019s manual for specific instructions on how to connect the wires.",
        "Some fixtures have an extra red wire, for instance, and you may need to connect it to a black ceiling wire.",
        "Wire color schemes vary from place to place, so research the regulations in your area to find out what each wire color represents.",
        "Generally, as long as you match the colored wires together, you will be fine.",
        "Screw wire connectors back onto the ends of the wires.",
        "You will need a single connector for each wire pair.",
        "Pick up the paired wires again and position the connector over the stripped ends.",
        "Twist it clockwise until it holds the wires tightly in place.",
        "Repeat this for the remaining wire pairs.",
        "Some ceiling lights use box-shaped connectors with holes on opposite sides.",
        "Simply plug the stripped ends of the wires into the holes to connect them.",
        "Tighten the mounting screws hanging from the junction box.",
        "Your junction box will have at least 1 of these screws hanging from the mounting bracket inside the box.",
        "Test the screws to make sure they are secure against the bracket.",
        "Make sure the bracket firmly in place and unable to move.",
        "If you need to replace the screws, twist them counterclockwise by hand.",
        "This allows you to remove the mounting bracket.",
        "Place the new screws and twist them 3 or 4 times to secure them to the bracket.",
        "Fold the wires into the junction box and screw the base to the ceiling.",
        "Raise the ceiling light\u2019s base, positioning it over the mounting screws.",
        "Place a metal nut on the end of each screw, twisting them clockwise by hand until they are tight and hold the base in place.",
        "Some fixtures use mounting brackets.",
        "If yours uses a mounting bracket, connect the bracket to the junction box using the included small screws.",
        "Then, hang the base over the mounting screws as you normally would.",
        "Some light fixtures have screw holes shaped like keyholes.",
        "Adjust the base so the screws are in the smaller grooves at the end of the keyholes.",
        "Then, use a screwdriver to tighten the screws.",
        "Install bulbs with the correct wattage in the sockets.",
        "Check the fixture\u2019s packaging or owner\u2019s manual for the recommended maximum bulb wattage.",
        "Avoid using bulbs with higher than the recommended wattage.",
        "Set the bulbs in the sockets, then turn them clockwise to secure them in place.",
        "Using higher-watt bulbs causes the ceiling light to overheat, increasing the risk of a fire.",
        "Lower-watt bulbs are safe to use, so err on the side of caution.",
        "Light fixtures generally handle incandescent bulbs up to 60 watts.",
        "For an eco-friendly choice, switch to CFL or LED bulbs.",
        "They have a lower wattage than incandescent bulbs despite giving off the same amount of light.",
        "These bulbs prevent overheating and save you money in the long run!",
        "Turn the electrical current back on to test the bulbs.",
        "Go to the circuit breaker in your home and flip the switch for the room you were working in.",
        "Then, turn on the room switch responsible for the ceiling light.",
        "Watch for the new ceiling light to shine as brightly as the old one.",
        "If the lights don\u2019t turn on, are flickering, or appear dim, chances are the wiring isn\u2019t correct.",
        "Turn off the power supply again, then unscrew the light fixture.",
        "Examine the wiring for loose connections and other mistakes.",
        "Attach the ceiling light shade and trim to the base.",
        "Flip the light switch in the room to turn off the bulbs.",
        "Climb back up the ladder, bringing the shade up to the base.",
        "Fit it over the base and attach it by twisting the connecting screws or pieces clockwise until they are tight and secure.",
        "Every light has different connecting components.",
        "Some lights have end pieces that fit over the shade, for instance, and you need to twist them clockwise until it is snug against the shade."
