Add 1 3/4 teaspoons (10 g) of salt to 1 side of the bowl and put 1 tablespoon (10 g) of instant yeast to the opposite side.Did You Know? It's important to use bread flour instead of all-purpose flour since bread flour has a higher protein content. This helps develop the gluten which gives the ciabatta it's wonderful texture. Prevent the yeast and salt from coming into direct contact since the salt will slow the yeast as it activates."
