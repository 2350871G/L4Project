Makeup highlighters are used to bring attention to features that you want people to focus on such as your cheekbones or jawline. Bronzers help to shape under your cheekbones to slim down a face. Begin with a brush that has lightly been brushed into bronzer. Dust off the extra bronzer and start by applying the brush at your temples and working your way down to your cheekbones using circular motions.
