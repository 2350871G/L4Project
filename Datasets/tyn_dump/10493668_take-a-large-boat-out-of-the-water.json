        "Move the trailer.",
        "The two support stands located in the middle of the trailer move back and forth along the trailer using a wheel and track.",
        "This means that if the blocks are set in the back, you can move the trailer away from the boat while keeping the stands attached to the front of the boat.",
        "The weight of the stern should be completely on the blocks while the weight of the front is still on the trailer.",
        "By moving the trailer back while keeping the boat up, this makes room to put blocks in the front of the boat.",
        "Place blocks in the bow (front) and middle of the boat.",
        "Place two stacks of cinder blocks in the middle of the boat (lengthwise) and one stack under the bow of the boat.",
        "As you did before, place wood on the blocks until there is only an inch of room.",
        "Make sure the blocks are centered with the boat width wise.",
        "Lower the trailer again.",
        "Once the trailer is lowered all the way, all of the boat's weight will be on the blocks and the boat will be completely off of the trailer.",
        "Once the boat is completely on the blocks, all of the support stands on the trailer should be lowered all the way so that they don't hit the hull (bottom of the boat) when moving the trailer.",
        "Move the trailer.",
        "Once the boat is on all of the blocks, the trailer can be moved as it will not be needed again.",
        "Add jack-stands.",
        "Jack stands are basically portable versions of the support stands on the trailer.",
        "Depending on the way the boat is blocked, 2-4 jack-stands will be needed (in this case, since there is 3 stacks of blocks under the stern, only 2 are needed).",
        "Place the stands near the center of the boat, one on each side and tighten them against the hull of the boat.",
        "The platforms of the jacks should be near the edge of the hull so that the weight is distributed.",
        "Keep the platforms of the stands flat against the hull (sometimes wood is needed to be placed in between the hull and jack-stands).",
        "Admire your work.",
        "It usually takes a lot of time, patience and care to properly take a large boat out of the water without damaging it and seeing the boat blocked up should make you feel accomplished."
