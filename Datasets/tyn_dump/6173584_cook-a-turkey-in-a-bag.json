                    "description": "Position one rack on the second-to-bottom rack ledge in your oven and remove any of the racks above it. You must change the position of the racks to ensure that the bag will have room to expand as it cooks. The bag must not touch the top or sides of the oven; if it does, the plastic will melt. Pull out your roasting pan, too. The pan must be at least 2 inches (5 cm) deep and large enough to prevent the bag from hanging over the sides."

                    "description": "Remove the turkey from its plastic or paper wrappings, then reach into the cavity and pull out the neck and giblets (liver, heart, and gizzard). To prevent possible contamination, keep the turkey in a clean sink as you remove the giblets. The giblets will usually be held together in a small bag, and both the neck and giblets should be fairly easy to remove from a thawed turkey. Discard the neck and giblets or save them to make turkey gravy, stock, or other similar recipes."

After packing in the stuffing, secure it by inserting a skewer through the ends of the open turkey cavity. Note that stuffing the turkey will increase the overall cooking time. If you want to have both stuffing and a shorter cooking time, your best option is to cook the stuffing and turkey separately."

Tie the twine firmly, but do not make it tight enough to dig into the flesh of the bird. If you tie it too tight, the twine will leave marks in the skin even after the turkey is finished cooking. Check the skin near the legs before tying them down. If there's a band of loose skin there, you can tuck the legs into that skin instead of tying them down with twine. Tying or tucking these elements will prevent them from drying out as the rest of the turkey cooks."

Melted butter will usually create better browning than margarine or oil. If desired, you could use a baster to squeeze additional melted butter into the space between the skin and the meat."

This combination is a very basic one, but you could use a different spice blend in the same way if you have a different poultry blend you would prefer. Other seasonings commonly used with turkey include garlic powder, paprika, and basil, among others."

Once you finish coating it, place the bag inside your roasting pan. Coating the bag with flour helps prevent the meat from sticking to the plastic. Additionally, the flour also makes the bag less likely to burst. Note that you could also coat the bag with nonstick cooking spray, if desired, but doing so is not necessary."

When finished, the opening of the bag should face the end of the roasting pan and should not face straight up. No part of the bag should hang over the edges of the pan.

Position these slits evenly over the top of the bag. Puncturing the bag is necessary so that steam can escape while the turkey cooks. If you do not puncture the bag, that steam can build up, and the pressure could cause the bag to burst inside the oven."

Do not place the thermometer inside of the bag since it will be too difficult to read there. Make sure that the tip of the thermometer only touches the meat of the turkey and does not come into contact with the bone. Even though most turkeys include a disposable pop-up thermometer, you should still insert an actual meat thermometer into the meat. Pop-up thermometers are not always an accurate gauge of doneness."

Roast for 3 to 3-1/2 hours for a 20 to 24 lb (9 to 10.8 kg) turkey. Note that these time ranges are for an unstuffed turkey. If you stuffed the turkey, you will need to add another 30 to 45 minutes to the cooking time. You should also test the temperature of the turkey breast before removing the bird from the oven.
