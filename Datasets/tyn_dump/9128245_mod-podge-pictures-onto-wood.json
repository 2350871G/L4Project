Work your way with the grain, not against it. To make sure it's smooth, you can slip a piece of pantyhose over the wood. If it doesn't snag on any small wood fragments, it's good to go. For a more professional touch, lightly sand the edges and corners of your wooden block or board. This give it a softer look."

You can give your piece a nicer finish by applying two coats of acrylic paint to the side edges. Allow the first coat to dry before applying the second one. Let the paint dry completely before moving on, about 20 minutes. Use acrylic paint in a color that matches the photograph. Extend the paint onto the front of the board. This way, if you accidentally cut the photo too small, you won't see any raw wood."
