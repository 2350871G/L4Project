    "text": " Making Powdered Milk Paint Mix together some powdered milk and water. You will need two parts powdered milk and one part water. A good starting amount would be 1 cup (125 grams) powdered milk and \u00bd cup (120 milliliters) water. Pour the powdered milk into a bowl first, then add the water. This paint is similar to tempera paint in that it has a slightly chalky finish. Divide the solution into smaller jars if you want more colors. How many jars you divide the solution into depends on how many colors of paint you want. Keep in mind that the more you divide it, the less paint you'll have for each color. Stir in a few drops of liquid food coloring. Start with 2 to 3 drops of food coloring, give the solution a stir, then add more if needed. You can also use powdered tempera instead of food coloring. You can find this in arts and crafts stores. Use the paint and refrigerate it when you are done. You can use this paint with a brush or with your fingers. Store the paint in the fridge in a tightly-closed jar when you are not using it. It will last about four days before expiring due to the powdered milk. Making Watercolor Paint Gather 5 to 10 dried-out markers that are the same color. If you don't have enough of one color, use colors from the same color family. For example, you can use red, pink, and burgundy to make red paint. You can also use fresh markers, but this method is a great way to put old markers into good use. Washable kids' markers (i.e. : Crayola, Rose Art, etc.) will work great for this. You can also try permanent markers (i.e. : Sharpie). Fill a small glass jar a quarter to halfway with water. The temperature of the water does not matter because you will be leaving the markers in the jar for several days. Baby food jars will work the best, but you can use small 4-ounce (120-milliliter) mason jars as well. Open the markers and place them into the water. You should see the color leeching out into the water almost immediately. If you don't, give the water a stir with the markers. Let the markers sit in the water for up to a week. As the days go by, the markers will release more color into the water. The water may evaporate, which is okay; the color will still be there. Take the markers out and dilute the paint, if desired. Test the paint with a watercolor brush on a piece of white paper. If the paint is too dark, add enough water until it reaches the level of lightness you want. If the paint is too light, let it sit in a sunny window for a day or two. The water will evaporate and leave behind more pigment. Use the paint on white paper with a watercolor brush. Watercolor paper will work the best, but you can use printer paper or construction paper too. Store the paint in a jar with a tight-fitting lid when you are done using it. If the paint starts to dry out, add a little water to it to reactivate it. Making Tempera Paint Separate an egg yolk from the egg white. Hold an egg over a cup and crack it open. Pass the yolk back and forth between the two shells until the egg white is in the cup. Put the yolk into another cup or jar. Save the egg white for another recipe, such as meringues. You only need to pass the yolk once or twice to get the white out. Add a few drops of food coloring into the egg yolk. Keep in mind that the egg yolk will add yellow to whatever color you use. Red will turn more orange, and blue will turn more green. You may be able to prevent this from happening by using more food coloring, however. Food coloring is potent. Start with 2 to 3 drops. You can always add more later. Make sure that you use liquid food coloring. Stir the yolk until it turns smooth. Use a fork or spoon to stir the yolk and food coloring together. You want the paint to be smooth, with no lumps, globs, streaks, or swirls. If the color is not quite right, add a few more drops of food coloring and stir again. The more food coloring you add, the darker the paint will be. Keep in mind that some colors will not turn out pure. For example, purple food coloring may turn out brown, no matter how many drops you add. Make more colors if desired. You will need one egg yolk and one cup for each color that you will be making. Keep in mind that you may not be able to make every color in the rainbow using this method, such as white. You may be able to get black or brown by mixing enough colors together, however. You can put all of the egg whites into the same cup. Use the paint within a few days. You can use this paint just like you would any other tempera paint. When you are done using it, close the jar tightly and put it into the fridge. Try to use the paint within a few days. It is made from eggs, so it will eventually go bad. Making Cornstarch Paint Place 6 tablespoons (45 grams) of cornstarch into a jar. This will be enough to make one color of paint. Although this paint does not contain any chalk, it looks just like chalk paint once it dries. If you can't find any cornstarch, look for cornflour instead. It is the same thing, but with a different name. This paint is similar to chalk paint in look and texture, but easier to create. Whisk in \u00bc cup (60 milliliters) of cold water. Add the water into the cornstarch a little bit at a time, stirring after each addition. You need the solution to be thick enough to drizzle from your whisk, so adjust the amount of water as needed. You may end up using a little less than \u00bc cup (60 milliliters) of water. Stir in a few drops of liquid food coloring. Start with just 2 to 3 drops. Keep stirring until the color is even and all streaks are gone. The more food coloring you add, the darker the color will be. Keep in mind that chalk paint will lighten up a bit once it dries. Skip this step if you want the chalk paint to be white. Use the paint on a sidewalk or driveway. You can apply the paint straight from the jar with a paintbrush. You can also pour it into a plastic squeeze bottle, then drizzle it over your painting surface. Sidewalks and driveways are the most popular surfaces for this type of paint, but you can use paper as well. Making Flour and Salt Paint Mix together equal amounts of flour, salt, and cold water. Pour \u00bd cup (50 grams) of flour and \u00bd cup (136 grams) of salt into a bowl. Mix them together, then stir in \u00bd cup (120 milliliters) of cold water. You can prepare this paint in a cup, bowl, or jar\u2014whichever is easiest for you. This will be the final texture of your paint.

You can also pour thicker paint into a plastic squeeze bottle and use it as a puffy paint instead. Store the paint in a sealed container in the fridge. Throw it out once it starts to look moldy. Making Chalk Paint Place 1 to 2 pieces of colored chalk inside a resealable plastic bag. For best results, use sidewalk chalk instead of chalkboard chalk. It is much more pigmented. The more chalk you use, the more paint you will have. Use two different colors to create a new color! Smash the chalk into a powder with a hammer. Place the bag with the chalk inside of it on top of a hard surface, such as a wooden board or a sidewalk. Hit the chalk with a hammer several times until it turns fine and powdery. Take this time to create more colors. Use one color of chalk per bag. If you are using a thin bag, such as a sandwich bag, place a paper towel under it, and another one on top of it. This will keep the bag from ripping. Pour the powder into a jar. Make sure that the jar is big enough to hold at least 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water. If you smashed multiple bags of chalk to create more colors, use a separate jar for each color. Stir in \u00bd to 1 cup (120 to 240 milliliters) water into the powdered chalk. Use If you one piece of chalk, use \u00bd (120 milliliters) of water. If you used two pieces of chalk, use 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water. Stir the paint well until the chalk dissolves.
