Secure one side while you work with the other, so they don't get mixed up. You can do this by adding a scrunchy or a hair clip, so that the one side doesn't get in the way. Try your best at containing any loose hairs which might pop out. Take the loose side and start at the nape of the neck. Split this section into three strands. If you want, you can also add a hair clip to each of these while you are preparing for the next step. Sometimes it can be hard to separate three strands all at once. Do an 'inside-out' French braid or Dutch Braid. Cross each of the strands underneath each other instead of over one another. Work your way around the side of the head, keeping the braid fairly tight. If the braid comes loose, it won't appear as a tight \"crown.\" Work across the top of the forehead until you finish the braid. Secure the end with an elastic band in order to keep the braid secure. Just let it hang down until you complete the other side. If you are afraid the braid might come undone, you can clip it to the top of your head until the \"crown\" is ready to be made.

Split this section into three parts. If you need to separate the sections by using elastic bands, feel free to do so. Braid the left side of your hair. Make an 'inside-out' French braid or Dutch Braid. You want to make sure that the braid is tight, otherwise it will not look like a \"crown.\" After you have completed the braid, tie an elastic band around the end to secure it in place.
