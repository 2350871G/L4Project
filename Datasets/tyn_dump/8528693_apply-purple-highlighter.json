                    "description": "Your skin should be as even as possible when you apply the highlighter, so you should start with a foundation. It\u2019s best to use a matte or satin finish formula because the highlighter will add enough glow to your skin. Use a brush or sponge to apply the foundation for the best coverage. For oily skin, choose an oil-free foundation formula to help prevent shine. A powder foundation is often a good option. For dry skin, choose a moisturizing foundation to help prevent dry, flaky patches. A cream foundation is often a good option. A liquid foundation works well for most skin types. If you have oily skin, choose a matte finish formula. If you have a dry skin, choose a satin finish foundation. If your skin is mostly clear, you can use a tinted moisturizer or BB cream in place of foundation for lighter coverage."

                    "description": "Applying a brightening concealer in a triangle shape beneath your eyes and along your cheekbones creates a base for the purple highlighter. Choose a concealer that\u2019s one or two shades lighter than your skin tone, and draw a triangle from the inner corner of the eye to beside your nostril in the center of the cheek to the top of the cheekbone beside the outer corner of the eye. Be sure to blend the concealer in well for a seamless look. You can use a fluffy concealer brush or a clean finger to blend in the concealer. A brush works best with liquid concealers, while a finger usually works best with a thicker cream formula. If you have discolorations on your face that you wish to conceal before applying the highlighter, don\u2019t use the brightening concealer -- it will draw attention to the spots. Instead, use a concealer that matches your skin tone exactly for blemishes and other discolorations."

Use a fluffy powder brush to lightly dust the powder over your entire face. If you want extra coverage from your setting powder, use a pressed powder. If you prefer a lighter look with your powder, opt for a loose, translucent setting powder. If you have very dry skin, you may want to skip setting powder because it can accentuate dry patches. Make sure to set the concealer under your eyes too. Use a small, fluffy brush to dust lightweight, translucent powder over the area."

Make sure to tap any excess highlighter powder off the brush before applying it to your skin. Excess powder may fall on other areas of the face where you don\u2019t want the highlighter. While you can wear purple highlighter no matter what your skintone, it can sometimes look ashy on darker skin. To combat the ashiness, apply a layer of a gold or peach highlighter over the tops of your cheekbones first and then dust the purple highlighter over it."

A highlighter brush may be too thick for your nose, so use a small, fluffy eyeshadow brush to lightly apply the highlighter down the center of your nose. For the most flattering look, it helps to contour your nose on either side of the highlight. Use a small, tapered shadow brush to apply a contour powder in a line on both sides of the highlight and blend well. Contour powders should always be cool-toned with gray undertones to mimic the look of shadows, but it\u2019s especially important to choose a cool contour powder when you\u2019re using purple highlighter."
