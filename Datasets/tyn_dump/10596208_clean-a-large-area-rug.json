Work in long, parallel strokes so that you clean the entire rug. Try to vacuum your rug at least once per week. Depending on the rug\u2019s thickness, you may need to adjust the knob on the vacuum that controls its suction power. Vacuuming a shag rug is a great way to get dust and dirt out of its long fibers. However, turn off the vacuum\u2019s beater bar so you don\u2019t inadvertently tear fibers off of the rug. If your vacuum doesn\u2019t have a turn-off for the beater bar, try borrowing a different vacuum from a friend. When you\u2019re vacuuming an Oriental rug or a home-made or hand-knotted rug, set a sheet of nylon screening over the rug for protection. Weigh the edges of the nylon down with 3\u20134 books. Sprinkle baking soda onto your rug and let it sit on your rug before vacuuming every 3 months. This will help deodorize your rug."
