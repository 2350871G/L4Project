Your roof likely doesn\u2019t meet this ideal, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s unsuitable for solar. East- or west-facing roof areas are okay, so long as they\u2019re not shaded by trees or other buildings. Roof pitches between 15 and 40 degrees are manageable. If you have a flat roof, hire a professional installer to angle the support structure as needed. 100 sq ft (9.3 m) of solar panel coverage produces around 1 kilowatt (kW) of energy on average, and the typical home requires around 5 kW.
