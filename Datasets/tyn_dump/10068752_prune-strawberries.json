Removing runners prevents your plants from wasting the saccharides they generate from photosynthesis\u2014referred to as photoassimilates\u2014on clone plants. If growing conditions are optimal (ample sunlight and water access), runners can remain without too much of an impact on your strawberry growth. Daughter plants created by runners can be detached from the mother to start new plants after they have rooted. However, this should be done sparingly."
