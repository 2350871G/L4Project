Attach support blocks to each post so that the tops are 3'10.5\u201d from the top of the post. You can also lay a scrap 2\u201dx4\u201d on top of the post and measure down 4'. Attach the bottom rails between the posts. Now attach the top rails. Place intermediate 2\u201dx4\u201d members on 8' centers from one end post, so that they are able to accept the 4'x8' plywood panels. Attach the plywood to the sides, cutting the last panel to fit. Paint the outside and top of the fence with a good outdoor primer and paint.  Cut 8 24\u201d pieces from one of the fence top rails. You can cut these yourself, or have the fence dealer make all the cuts for you, although they will charge you extra for this service. Two 1/4\u201d holes must be drilled in each piece no closer than 7\u201d from one end. Use a center punch to create a dimple to start the drill hole. Drill the holes with a drill press or a portable hand drill. Drill all the way through the pipe; making a smaller 1/8\u201d hole first will make drilling the 1/4\u201d hole easier. From the center of the first post, mark along the wall every 10', and then mark a line using a framing square 22\u201d down the wall. This is where the 24\u201d top rail will be secured. Clamp the pipe to the wall covering the line with the top flush with the top of the wall. Using the existing holes in the pipe, drill through the pipe about one inch into the wall and post. Secure the pipe to the wall using a 4\u201d lag screw and a thick washer between the pipe and wall; do this in only the top hole \u2013 do not completely tighten. Do this for the remaining 10' sections and add the connectors as shown in the photo. Pivot the short pipe on the top screw to an angle that allows the connectors to slide on top of it. Once all the connectors and 118\u201d top rail pipes have been connected, go back and secure the bottom lag screw and washer and tighten both. Do the same on the other wall. Gather four 56\u201d top rail pipes and two end midway connectors and a peak connector. With the assistance of an 8 or 10 stepladder, assemble the pipe lengths and connectors from each side of the end of the wall, placing the peak connector last. Add a 56\u201d top rail pipe into the second wall connector (1,2). Place a 118\u201d top rail pipe (3) into the second connector, up on the end. The longer the pipe, the more flexibility you have to move the ends of the pipe, so place a mid way connector on the end of the 118\u201d pipe (4), and move it away from the end of the 56\u201d pipe until you can slide it over and into position.

Unfold the cover in a large location so that it can accommodate the 20'x 30' size. Roll or fold the cover so that it is 30' long. Transport it to the shelter site, and lay it along the outside of one fence. Attach 30' ropes in three or four places along the length of the cover through the grommets. Throw the ropes over the tubular framework to the other fence. Pull each rope three or four feet, pulling the cover over the framework. Tie it off and move to the next rope doing the same. Continue to do this until you have pulled the cover all the way over the framework. Using a stepladder, secure the center of the cover at the frameworks peak, using a bungee ball at two locations. Do the same at the other end. Secure each corner in both directions. Now go back and secure the remaining grommets to the 118\u201d rail near the top of the fence. Alternate between each fence so the cover isn't stretched to one side more than the other. Using the ladder, finish the end grommets.",
