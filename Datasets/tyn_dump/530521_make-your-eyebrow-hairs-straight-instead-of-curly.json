Use a sharp and slanted tweezer along with a mirror in a well lit room to pick out any loose hairs. Slanted tweezers ensure you don\u2019t pinch at the skin when trying to pluck stray hairs from their root. Take your time and pick individual hairs working inward from your eyebrow. A hasty approach can cause you to pluck several hairs at once making your eyebrows look patchy and cause you some unwanted pain. If you have over plucked, don\u2019t repeat until you have given your eyebrows at least a month to grow back into its natural shape. Use a concealer to find out how your eyebrows will look after you have plucked the unwanted hairs. Tweeze after a shower or washing your face with hot water. Warm water softens your hair and opens the follicles so that your hair is easier to remove. If you have a lot of hair that needs to be removed, you may want to use a razor, wax, or another method that removes a lot of hair quickly. Research which method appeals to you as each have their own pros and cons."
