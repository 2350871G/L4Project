This will allow you to clean the device as thoroughly as possible without risking burns. Clean the tip immediately after the solder iron to limit buildup over time. Place a sticky note near your workspace if you find yourself forgetting often to make cleaning the iron a priority."

Doing this first will take care of any mild buildup and help you discern in a safe way whether the tip is still too warm to touch with bare hands.
