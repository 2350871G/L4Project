Use a paper slicer to cut the paper into 1 1/2 by 6-inch (3.8 by 15-cm) strips. You will need 1 strip to make 1 bookmark. This is a great DIY activity for baby showers.

It will become thicker after you laminate it. You can use solid-colored cardstock instead. This will make your bookmark thicker, however. Round the corners with a corner punch, if desired. Buy a rounded corner cutting punch from the scrapbooking section of a craft store. Use it to cut the top and bottom corners of your bookmark to make them more rounded, just like a store-bought bookmark. Skip this step if you want your bookmark to have sharp corners. Decorate the bookmark with baby-themed stickers or letters. You can find these in the sticker section of a craft store. Write the baby's name or a message, such as \"It's a Boy!\" or \"It's a Girl!\" by hand or with letter stickers. Don't use 3D, layered, or puffy stickers. Most sticker sections are further divided into themes. Check out the baby theme or the letter theme. Laminate the bookmarks. You can do these yourself with a laminating machine or have it done for you at a photocopy/office supply store. You can also laminate them with contact paper, but be aware that contact paper is not perfectly clear; your design won't be as bright. Laminate all of the bookmarks at once in sheets.

You don't need to use the craft puncher to round the corners this time. Just follow the curve as best as you can. Punch a hole in the top of each bookmark if you want to add a tassel. Make the hole about \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) from the top edge of the bookmark. If you wish to leave the bookmarks plain without a tassel, then you can skip this step. Secure thin ribbon to the hole with a slipknot. Cut 1 to 2 6-inch (15-cm) strands of thin satin ribbon. Stack the ribbons together and fold them in half. Stick the folded end through the hole by about 1 inch (2.5 cm) to make a loop. Pull the ends of the ribbon through the loop, then tug on them to tighten the slipknot. Skip this step if you want to leave the bookmarks plain. Choose a color that matches the scrapbooking paper. Making Ribbon Bookmarks Cut 5/8-inch (16-mm) ribbon into 6 to 9-inch (15 to 23-cm) lengths. You can find these ribbons online or in the ribbon section of a craft or fabric store. Grosgrain ribbon will work the best, but you can use satin ribbon too. If you can't find a baby-themed ribbon that you like, choose a color to match the gender of your baby instead. Use pink for baby girls and blue for baby boys. For a gender-neutral color, try purple or yellow. Cut the ends of the ribbon straight across or the crimp won't fit. Don't cut the ribbons at an angle or into notches. You can use a different width of ribbon, but you'll need to get the matching ribbon clamp end crimps. Slide 5/8-inch (16-mm) ribbon clamps onto each end of your ribbon. These are special crimps made specifically for ribbon bookmarks and necklaces; you can find them in the beading section of a craft store. They are shaped like narrow, metal rectangles. If your ribbon won't slide into the crimp, pry the crimp open with a coin or a screwdriver. Pinch the crimps closed with pliers. Make sure the ends are the ribbon are all the way inside the crimp. Pinch the crimps shut over the ribbon by clamping pliers over them. This will seal the ends of your ribbon and give them a nicer finish. Cut off the metal loop on 1 of the metal crimps, if desired. The crimps will have a metal loop at each end for adding jump rings. You will be using only 1 of these. Use a pair of heavy-duty wire cutters to cut the other metal loop off as close to the crimp as possible. You don't have to do this step, but it will give your bookmark a nicer finish. If the cut isn't clean, file it down with a metal file, a nail file, or sandpaper. Open a jump ring. Hold a jump ring between 2 pliers. Twist 1 of the pliers towards you and the other plier away from you. Do not pull the ends of the jump ring away from each other like opening a book, or you'll distort it. Slide the ends past each other instead. If you don't have 2 pliers, use 1 plier for 1 side of the jump ring, and your thumb and index finger for the other. If your pendant or charm already has a jump ring on it, you do not need a second jump ring. Use this step to open the jump ring that's on the pendant or charm. Add a baby themed pendant or charm to the jump ring. You can finds lots of options online or in the beading section of a craft store. Sometimes, the wedding and baby shower section will also have options. Baby bottles, rattles, onesies, and safety pins all make great options. You can also use a letter instead. If you are using a letter pendant, you can match it to the baby's first initial, or to the first initial of the guest that you are giving it to. Hook the jump ring into the crimp's loop and close it. Slide the jump ring through the loop on 1 of the metal crimps. Make sure that the pendant is on the jump ring too. Grip the jump ring between the 2 pliers and pull them towards each other to close the jump ring. If there is a small gap in the jump ring, pinch the jump ring between a pair of pliers to close the gap. Designing Bookmarks on the Computer Open a new document in a word editing program. This method focuses on using recent editions of Microsoft Word. You may be able to complete this method using other word editing programs, but the commands may be different. To fit more bookmarks on your page, orient the paper horizontally. Insert a 6 by 2-inch (15 by 5.1-cm) rectangular shape. Click on the insert tab, then select the shape option. Insert a rectangle shape, then click and drag on the corners until it is 6 inches (15 cm) tall and 2 inches (5.1 cm) wide. Use the top and side rulers as a measuring guide. Some programs have an option where you can type in the dimensions of the rectangle. This may help make your measurements more accurate. Change the color, fill, and outline of the shape. Use the different editing options in the program to change the outline and fill color of the shape. You can use a solid color, a pattern, or even a gradient. Some programs will even allow you to use an image as the background. The background image needs to be saved on your computer. Match the color/pattern/theme to your baby shower's theme. Alternatively, match them to your baby's gender instead. Make sure that the rectangle's layout is set to \"Behind text.\" Insert a text box or word art and make it smaller then you bookmark. Select the Insert tab, then insert a text box or word art. Adjust the size of the text box/word art so that it is just a little smaller than your bookmark. A text box allows you to input text using Microsoft Word's existing fonts. It looks exactly what you'd type in on any ordinary document. Word art allows you to create fancier text. You can change the outline and fill color to whatever you want, including gradients. You can even add shadows! Add your choice of text, then edit it to coordinate with the background. Type in any message you want, such as \"It's a Boy!\" or \"It's a Girl!\". You can also type in the baby's name and expected due date. Change the color and size of the text so that it stands out. Make it large enough to fill the bookmark. For longer massages, such as \"It's a Boy/Girl! \", orient the text horizontally. For shorter messages, such as the baby's name, orient the text vertically. If the text doesn't appear, click on the text, then set the layout to \"In front of text.\" Group everything together. Click on the rectangular background image of your bookmark. Press and hold the \"Shift\" key, then click on the text box or word art. All of the items should have the click-and-drag- corners. Let go of the \"Shift\" key, then right on 1 of the items to bring up a menu. Select \"group\" from the menu to link the items together. Copy-paste the bookmark to fill the page. Right-click on your grouped image, then click Ctrl+C or (copy). Click on another page, and click Ctrl+V or \"paste.\" If you successfully grouped the items in the previous step, you should be able to paste all of them at once. Repeat this step until you have the page filled. Leave about 1-inch (2.5-cm) to each side of each bookmark. Expect to fit 3 to 4 bookmarks per page. Print the bookmark on cardstock. Use a laser printer for best results. If you don't have a laser printer, consider getting your bookmarks printed at a print shop or office shop instead. Alternatively, you can print out just 1 page of bookmarks, then use a photocopier to make more. Cut the bookmarks out with a paper slicer. You can do this with a metal ruler and craft blade, but a paper slicer will make the cuts faster and neater. Try to cut as close to the edge of the bookmarks as possible so that no white paper is showing. Laminate the bookmarks, if desired, then cut them out. You won't have to do this, but it will give your bookmarks a nicer touch. You can do this with a laminating machine, or get it done in a print shop. You can also use contact paper instead. Laminate all for the bookmarks together, then cut them out separately. If you're worried about the laminate coming apart, leave a 1\u20448 in (0.32 cm) border all around. Punch a hole in the top of the bookmarks for adding tassels. Use a hole puncher to punch a hole about \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) from the top of each bookmark. If you don't want to add tassels, then you are done and can skip this step. Tie a thin ribbon to the bookmark with a slipknot. Cut 1 or 2 6-inch (15-cm) strands of thin satin ribbon. Stack the ribbons and fold them in half. Pull the folded end of the ribbon through the hole by about 1 inch (2.5 cm) to create a loop. Slide the ends of the ribbon through the loop, then pull on them to tighten the slipknot. Use a color that matches the bookmark.",
