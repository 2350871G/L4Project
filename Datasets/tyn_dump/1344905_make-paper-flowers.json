It allows for slightly different shades within the same piece that look natural and reminiscent of a real flower. For watercolor paper, you simply dip your brush in a bit of clean water, add some watercolor paint to the tips of the brush, and go over the paper. The best part about it is that it\u2019s supposed to look slightly different in every spot, so you don\u2019t have to worry about shading or blending. You can also use cardstock or construction paper, too, and it\u2019s quicker and cheaper. You just won\u2019t have the soft gradient of watercolor paper; however, you could choose a more vivid color with this type instead."

        "Take the pencil or Q-tip out and you'll be left with a rolled paper that looks very much like a flower.",
        "To keep it together, dab the bottom side with hot glue \u2013 and you're done.",
        "Talk about easy!",
        "Your first one or two may not be perfect, but as you keep going you'll be able to figure out what will create the look you're going for.",
        "You'll also notice that as you create more, they look neater and neater.",
        "You could also attach a pipe cleaner or a hanger wrapped in green planter's tape to the bottom for a stem.",
        "Who doesn't love a homemade bouquet?",
        "Making Tissue Carnations Choose a variety of different colored pieces of tissue paper.",
        "A classic flower will be made up of only one shade, but if you're feeling adventurous, combine a few together.",
        "For each flower, you'll need 3 or 4 sheets of tissue paper.",
        "When you've chosen your tissue paper, place them together, lined up in a pile.",
        "Cut strips from the tissue paper.",
        "How much you should cut will depend on the size of the flower you want to make.",
        "As a general rule of thumb cut a strip twice as big as the flower you want to create.",
        "If you're making several flowers experiment with different sizes.",
        "Just cut strips that are of various widths and it will automatically create smaller and bigger flowers.",
        "Cut vertical lines into the strip, leaving an inch or so untouched.",
        "Go down the strip cutting little snips into the tissue paper at even intervals.",
        "If you want teeny petals, make the snips close together; if you want larger petals, make them farther apart.",
        "Leave an inch or so of tissue paper untouched at one end of the strip.",
        "This will be the part of the flower that you work with and use as your base, so you don't want it shredded.",
        "The strip should still include every layer of tissue paper that you started with.",
        "No need to cut one sheet at a time.",
        "Take a small piece of floral wire and bend it at the top.",
        "Wrap a piece of masking tape around the loop once it's formed.",
        "This will be the bud of your flower and will give the flower something to structure itself around.",
        "If you don't want a masking tape bud, you can either color the masking tape or cover it with more tissue paper.",
        "You could also try leaving the floral wire exposed.",
        "With enough petals, it may blend right in.",
        "Take your cut up strip and wrap it around the stem.",
        "Roll and roll and roll until you come to the other side of the strip and it's all wrapped up.",
        "Then, take another piece of masking tape and wrap it around the base of the paper, securing it in place.",
        "Do this to as many layers as you want of paper.",
        "Once the tape is on, fluff your \"petals\" to give them a more flowery look.",
        "Spread them out and squish them a little to get them to sprawl out like a carnation.",
        "After you have made your flower, take the floral tape and wrap it over the masking tape.",
        "Floral tape is green and will look more like a stem.",
        "Then you can take the end of the tape and attach it to anything, whether it's a card or the end of a pen.",
        "If your flower still seems like it's missing something, try wrapping a ribbon around the base.",
        "This also provides you another way to attach the flower to something without using the tape.",
        "A ribbon is much more delicate and will emphasize the cuteness of your flower."
