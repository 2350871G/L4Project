    "text": " Getting Started Get a snorkel and mask you feel comfortable with. Try them on and adjust the straps until it fits. If you can, try them on in the water to make sure there are no leaks. If you have bad eyesight, consider getting a prescription-adjusted mask to help you see underwater without your glasses or using contact lenses. Disposable ones are great for snorkelling in. Put on the mask and tug the straps until it feels comfortably sealed around your eyes and nose. Make sure the snorkel tube is close to your mouth, but don't put it in yet. Lay flat in the water on your stomach. Place your face in the water at about a 45 degree angle. Bite gently down on the mouthpiece of the snorkel. Allow your lips to seal around it and hold the snorkel in place. Take slow, regular breaths in and out through the tube. Breathe slowly, deeply and cautiously with your mouth through your snorkel. No need to panic: you can always lift your head above water if you want. Just relax and become aware of your breaths. The sound of your breathing through the snorkel barrel should become quite noticeable. Once you get into a rhythm, relax and enjoy the underwater scenery. Wear a buoyancy vest.
