Then, dump it out again after you finish vacuuming. This prevents dirt from building up inside the canister and your machine. Over time, dirt may coat the inside of the cannister. To deep-clean it, rinse the canister with water. You can use a garden hose and clean the canister outside to minimize the mess. This is especially important if you're using a stick vacuum, since it has a much smaller dust canister."
