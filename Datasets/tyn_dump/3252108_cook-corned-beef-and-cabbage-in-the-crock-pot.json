The baby red potatoes should be briefly rinsed with cool water and scrubbed with a vegetable brush. When done, cut them in half crosswise. The celery stalks should be cut into pieces that are roughly 3 inches (7.6 cm) long. Rinse under cool water if necessary. The cabbage must cut into six or more wedges. Cut the cabbage in half lengthwise and remove part of the core, leaving just enough intact to hold the leaves together. Cut each half into three or four wedges. Rinse under cool water, if necessary. The baby carrots and pearl onions do not need to be cut for this recipe. If, however, you are using standard carrots and standard onions, the carrots must be cleaned and cut into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces, and the onion should be peeled and cut into wedges."

Coat the bottom and sides of the slow cooker with a fine spray. Alternatively, you could use a slow cooker liner, instead.

Onions are less likely to stick to the sides of the slow cooker as much as many of the other ingredients might. Moreover, as fragrant vegetables, the aroma and flavor of the onions can seep upward and into the less dense, more permeable ingredients. Set the corned beef brisket on top.
