                    "description": "Because you\u2019ll be leaving your hair down, it\u2019s important to brush your hair so it looks neat and smooth. Use your favorite brush or comb to remove any tangles and ready your hair for styling. If your hair is curly, use a wide tooth comb if you need to detangle or remove knots. Using a brush can cause frizz for curly locks. With curly hair, you have an easier time braiding the hair if it's damp. Style your hair before it's dried completely after you wash it or mist it lightly with water from a spray bottle if it's dry to start with. If your hair is prone to frizz, you may want to work a smoothing serum or hair oil through it before styling."

The most common spot for the braid is on one side of your hair, so gather a small section that\u2019s approximately 1- to 2-inches wide (2.5- to 5-cm) in the area where you wish to place the braid. You can gather a small section of hair right beside your face on either side or take a section that\u2019s a little further back. You don\u2019t necessarily have to choose a section of hair from the side of your head. An accent braid can look great peeking out from the lower section of your hair at the back too. You can make your accent braid as wide or narrow as you\u2019d like. You may want to experiment with different sized braids to see what works best with your hair type and texture. If you want your accent braid to really stand out, consider using color to spice it up. Before you braid the hair, color it with hair chalk. You can also add a small clip-on hair extension in a bold color and braid it instead of your own hair."

Once your hair is pulled back into the ponytail, you can remove the elastic from the end of the braid if you\u2019d like. Using an Accent Braid with a Half Up Half Down 'Do Pull the top section of your hair hair back and secure. For a classic half up half down style, you need to pull back the top section of your hair.

Allow one small section to fall loose on one side of the pony so you have hair that you can create a braid with. The section of hair that you separate should be fairly wide. It\u2019s best to use a section that\u2019s at least 1 \u00bd-inches (4-cm) wide. Curl the ponytail up into a bun without the section that you\u2019ve removed. With the section of hair that you\u2019ve separated hanging free, curl the rest of the ponytail around the base to form a bun. Use bobby pins to secure the bun in place. Braid the loose section of hair. Once the bun is secure, create a three-strand braid from the section of hair that you separated from it. Secure the end of the braid with a thin hair elastic so it\u2019s easy to hide. You want the braid to be as thick as possible.
