    "text": " Using a UV Filter Make sure your pond has other filtration equipment. While a UV filter kills algae, it doesn\u2019t actually filter the water. Ensure you have items like a good pump, a mechanical filter, and a biological filter in order to remove the dead algae and keep the water clear. Select a UV filter based on the size of your pond. Check out the rating on the package to determine how many gallons can be filtered per hour. Then, choose a filter that can filter half the volume of your pond per hour. Pond filters are available at garden centers and pond supply stores as well as online. Mount the UV filter on a dry, flat surface. The filter doesn\u2019t actually go in the pond itself. Attach it to a surface outside of the pond, such as on top of the canister pond filter. Then, plug it into a GFI outlet. The filter is waterproof, but refrain from submerging it in the pond. Replace the UV bulb once a year. A downside of UV filters is that the lights don't last very long, especially considering the fact that they're low power bulbs. Change the bulb at the beginning of the spring season every year to ensure it stays effective. Adding Algaecide to Your Pond Get quaternary ammonia algaecide.
