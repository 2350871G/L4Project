        "This method is especially useful for those people unable to haul multiple buckets of water around in order to perform regular cleanings.",
        "It also minimizes the potential to create a watery mess.",
        "Just make sure that the new water that you are adding is close to the original temperature of the tank.",
        "Check this before starting the automatic suctioning process.",
        "Siphon out any substrate debris with a gravel siphon.",
        "If you don\u2019t have an all-in-one system, then you will need to perform the water switch by hand.",
        "Start by placing the tube end of your siphon into a bucket.",
        "Then, place the siphon tip into the tank\u2019s substrate, usually gravel or sand.",
        "Repeatedly insert the siphon deep into the sand at an angle, drawing out both debris and tank water.",
        "Don\u2019t feel as if you have to perfectly clean all of the gravel during each change.",
        "In fact, it is better if you section off your tank and clean certain areas of the gravel each time.",
        "This lessens the impact of the change for your fish.",
        "Suck out water from the tank.",
        "As you move your siphon around, you will notice that your bucket begins to fill with dirty gravel and murky tank water, this is perfectly normal and what you want.",
        "However, don\u2019t take it too far.",
        "Use your siphon to remove a maximum of 30% of the tank\u2019s water.",
        "Going beyond this can irreparably alter your tank\u2019s chemistry.",
        "For example, if you have a 10 gallon tank, it is a good idea to use a 3 gallon bucket for water changes.",
        "Then, when the bucket is full, you know that you\u2019ve removed the right amount of water.",
        "Take a detailed look at your tank\u2019s interior.",
        "Now that your tank is less full, spend a bit of time checking out the status of your tank from an inside view.",
        "If you don\u2019t fully remove your decorations, then perhaps pick them up and look them over for any damage.",
        "Check to make sure that all of your heating and filtration systems seem okay in structure.",
        "Note the temperature of the remaining water.",
        "If you have a tank-side thermometer, make a quick note of the temperature of the water post-drain.",
        "Otherwise, it is a good idea to dip a thermometer into the water to get a reading.",
        "Then, test the temperature of the clean, treated water that you will add to the tank in a bit.",
        "Make sure that the two temperatures match.",
        "If not, you may need to give it a some more time before completing the change.",
        "Water temperature fluctuations can make fish more susceptible to illness.",
        "Make sure to take the tank\u2019s temperature again after you\u2019ve added in the fresh water.",
        "Re-fill the tank with pretreated water.",
        "At this point, you will want to move the pretreated water from the bucket into the tank.",
        "You can do this by pouring the water into a pitcher and then emptying the pitcher into the tank.",
        "Or, you can hold the bucket with both hands and empty it directly into the tank.",
        "Whichever method you choose, just make sure that the water doesn\u2019t rush in super-fast and disturb the gravel and your decorations.",
        "Some people like to use their hand, or a plate, to lessen the direct flow of the water into the tank.",
        "Replace all decorations and plants.",
        "If you\u2019ve taken out any of your artificial decorations, you can add them back in either immediately before, or directly after, refilling the tank.",
        "You can use this as an opportunity to move items around, or to leave items out entirely for a new look.",
        "Reconnect the filtration system, heater, and light.",
        "All of the functioning systems that you unplugged at the start of this process now need to be hooked up again.",
        "Make sure your hands are dry and carefully reinstall and restart all of these items.",
        "Some types of filers, such as the hang-on ones, will need 1-2 cups of water directly fed into the system before they will start working.",
        "Rinse off and store your equipment.",
        "Create a designated area where you keep all of your tank cleaning supplies.",
        "You will want to allow your buckets, scrubbers, and siphon to air dry before storing.",
        "Keeping up with regular storage procedures may keep you from having to buy replacements.",
        "Keeping Your Tank Clean in the Long Term Schedule weekly partial water changes.",
        "It is a good idea to complete a weekly, or bi-weekly, water change on a consistent basis.",
        "Again, you will not remove all of the water each time, only 25-30%.",
        "If you see the need, you can also do a deep cleaning of your tank on a monthly basis.",
        "You must balance out a desire to keep your tank clean with the health of your fish.",
        "Too frequent, or too few, cleanings can adversely impact their health.",
        "\u201dReset\u201d your tank with water changes.",
        "Performing partial changes is also an excellent way to re-establish stability in your tank after an unusual event, such as a re-scaping or a chemical overdose.",
        "Don\u2019t be afraid to do an unscheduled water change in these cases as the reward is worth it.",
        "Limit your light usage.",
        "If you run your aquarium lights all day and every day, you will likely see a quick, aggressive accumulation of algae and debris.",
        "This is because the light is helping the algae to feed off of your tank.",
        "Instead, try keeping your lights on for 10-14 hours for tanks with live plants or 6-10 hours otherwise.",
        "Avoid overfeeding.",
        "Much of the debris that you siphon out of the gravel will be leftover food.",
        "To avoid this issue, resist the desire to overfeed and instead stick with a once or twice daily schedule.",
        "And, adjust your feeding practices depending on how well your fish eat what is offered."
