If you break the old window, be extremely careful clearing the shards. Ensure the you sweep up or clear the area with a shop vac and wear gloves. Cut through the frame. Use a circular saw or a hand saw to make the first cut into the current window frame. This will make it easier to pry out the frame. Rip out the old jamb. The frame\u2019s material will determine how difficult this process is. For many frames you may be able to use a simple pry bar to rip out the frame.

Ask your glass fabricator for suggestions. Remove caulking with a utility knife. You want the space to be as clear and even as possible before installing the block panel, so remove any leftover caulking and clear the space of any debris. Installing the Block Glass Panel Install cedar shims at the bottom of the frame. The shims will help hold the panel in place, and they will ensure an even placement of the panel in the space. The shims should be about 1/2\u201d (1.27cm) wide and long enough to easily remove once the first round of mortar sets. Install the shims at 3\u201d (7.62cm) intervals, moving away from the corners. Mix small batches of mortar. You can mix batches about five or six trowel amounts at a time. It should ideally have a consistency close to bread dough, which will stop the panel from floating in the space as its sets. Apply a small amount of mortar to the bottom of the frame. This should just be a thin layer between the shims to help form a base before placing the window. Tilt or slide the panel into position over the shims. The panel will be heavy, so have assistance on hand to place the panel. Reset any shims that move while setting the panel. Slide shims into the top of the window until it is snug. Assure the window is plumb and square before continuing. Pack the gaps at the bottom with mortar. Use a trowel and pack the gaps around the shims at the bottom of the panel. Allow it to set, hard to the touch, before mortaring the sides. From inside, scrape away any clumps of mortar with your trowel. Mortar the sides of the panel. Assure that the mortar is firmly set before applying pressure to the window. Slide all of your shims out and finish mortaring the gaps once the mortar has set. Allow the mortar to set for two hours and then smooth it out with a striking tool. Clean any excess mortar off the panel with a sponge while it is still wet.
