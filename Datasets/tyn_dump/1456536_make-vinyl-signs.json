The adhesive side of the vinyl will now be exposed. Spray an application fluid on the background surface for your sign's vinyl if you think you may need to readjust the vinyl. The fluid will prevent the vinyl's adhesive from sticking to the surface for 20 to 30 seconds. Place the vinyl adhesive-side down on the intended surface for the sign. Reposition it if necessary. Press out any air bubbles between the vinyl and its surface by running the squeegee applicator over the transfer tape. Pull off the transfer tape gently to reveal your sign. Start pulling from 1 of the tape's corners."
