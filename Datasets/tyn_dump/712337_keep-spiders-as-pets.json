You can purchase a ready-made habitat for your spider. An aquarium that you can buy at a pet store will work just fine. Make sure that the cage is at least 2-3 times the spider's leg span. This will ensure that it has plenty of room to move around. If you have a ground-dwelling tarantula, make sure that the cage is not too tall, as the spider could fall from  the ceiling, which could be fatal to the spider. Add materials to make your spider feel at home. You can place leaves, dirt, and rocks in the cage. Spiders also like to have somewhere to hide. If you have a large enough cage, you can place a small flower pot on its side in the cage. You could use a piece of wood, too."
