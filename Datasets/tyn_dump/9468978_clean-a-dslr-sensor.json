        "Tilt the swab at an angle and drag it from one end of the sensor to the other, then back again.",
        "Lift the swab off of the sensor after you've dragged it both ways to avoid smudging.",
        "Apply light pressure as you drag the swab across the sensor.",
        "Don't worry about getting all of the dust off with your first swab.",
        "You can always repeat the process as necessary.",
        "Throw away your sensor swab when you\u2019re done.",
        "It\u2019s no longer sterile, so don\u2019t re-use it.",
        "Check for leftover dust with a sensor scope.",
        "A sensor scope is a lens-sized magnifying glass with a light shining at the end of the scope.",
        "Place the scope over your camera to check for more dust after you've finished cleaning.",
        "If you spot more dust, use a second sensor swab to clean the sensor again.",
        "Sensor scopes can be purchased online or at most camera shops.",
        "Shut the camera off to flip the mirror back down.",
        "Most cameras will automatically replace the mirror over the sensor when you shut off the power.",
        "Turn the camera off, then screw the lens back into place.",
        "Take a photo after cleaning to check for any last dust particles.",
        "To make sure your sensor is as clean as it can be, take an out of focus photo with the camera aperture set to f/22.",
        "Upload the photo to your computer and desaturate it with an editing program like Photoshop.",
        "Zoom in and closely examine the photo to find dust spots you may have missed.",
        "If you spot any other dust particles, you can clean the sensor again with a sensor swab and a few drops of sensor cleaning solution.",
        "Checking if Your Sensor is Dirty Set your ISO to its lowest normal range.",
        "Do not set your ISO lower than its extended range, which may impede your camera's ability to spot all dirty areas on your sensor.",
        "If your camera has an automatic ISO setting, change it to manual and adjust it based on your camera manual's lowest ISO instructions.",
        "The lowest ISO range for most digital cameras is 100.",
        "Turn on your camera's manual focus.",
        "To catch all the dust and debris on your sensor when you take the picture, you'll want the photo to be out of focus.",
        "If taking the picture indoors, set the focus to infinity.",
        "If taking it outdoors, set it to close-focus.",
        "Choose an f/22 aperture level.",
        "A medium-sized aperture level, like f/22, is ideal for checking for dust.",
        "If your aperture is too wide, you may not be able to see any dust, while a small setting may provide so much detail that you see dust in the air or on other objects rather than your camera sensor.",
        "f/16 is also considered an acceptable aperture level for checking for sensor dust.",
        "Take a picture of a blank background.",
        "If your photo is too detailed, you may not be able to distinguish between dust and spots of light or blurry objects.",
        "A white wall, cloudy sky, or blank piece of paper works as a perfect background.",
        "Move the camera slightly as you take the picture to further blur it.",
        "Process the photo online to check for spots.",
        "Running your photo through an editing program will help you catch dust spots.",
        "Desaturate the photo and increase the contrast to make spots more visible.",
        "Sensor dust will look like small, dark circles randomly dotting your photo.",
        "If your photo seems more smudged than spotted, your lens may need cleaning instead of your sensor."
