If your cat is having litter box issues, then the best thing to do is to take her to see a veterinarian to rule out medical issues and then work on retraining your cat to use the litter box. If your cat is healthy, then you can try some different techniques to get your cat to use her box, such as:\nKeeping one more box than the total number of cats in your home. Changing the litter more frequently. Trying a different brand of litter. Placing the litter box in a quieter place in your home. Placing litter boxes in more rooms of your house to make using the box more convenient. Removing the liner and/or hood from the litter box, since these can make some cats uncomfortable. Filling your cat's litter box with only one to two inches of litter, which is what most cats prefer. Getting a large or extra large litter box, since some cats dislike small boxes. Getting an easy entry box if you have an older cat. These boxes have a lower edge or an opening to make it easier for your cat to get in and out of the box."
