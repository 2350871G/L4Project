        "When you\u2019re using socks or rags to curl your hair, it\u2019s best not to start with completely wet hair because your locks can become frizzier that way.",
        "Instead, just dampen the sections of hair as necessary.",
        "Use a spray bottle filled with water to mist the section of hair that you\u2019re working with, so it will hold the curl more easily.",
        "Instead of using plain water to dampen your hair, you may prefer to dampen with a texturizing or curl enhancing spray to help give your curls more texture.",
        "Roll your hair around a sock or rag.",
        "When your section of hair is damp, take a clean sock or strip of fabric and roll your hair around it, starting approximately 1-inch from the end.",
        "Continue rolling the hair and sock all the way up to the crown of your head.",
        "At the top, tie the sock or rag into a knot to secure it in place.",
        "Make sure to keep the hair as neat as possible as you roll it toward the top of your head, so you don\u2019t wind up with any kinks or bends in your hair when you\u2019re done.",
        "You shouldn\u2019t tie the knots too tightly when you\u2019re securing the hair in place or you may have trouble removing the socks or rags later.",
        "If you\u2019re using rags to curl your hair, you should cut strips of fabric that are approximately 2-inches wide and 8- to 10-inches in length.",
        "Repeat the process for your entire head.",
        "Take another clean sock or rag, and repeat the process on your next section of hair.",
        "Continue all around your head until all of your hair has been curled and secured in place.",
        "It can take anywhere from four to eight socks to curl all of your hair.",
        "If you\u2019re using rags, you\u2019ll probably need between 10 and 20 strips of fabric for your whole head.",
        "Allow your hair to sit.",
        "In order for the curls in your hair to take hold, you have to allow the socks or rags to stay in place for a while.",
        "It\u2019s best to sleep on with the fabric in your hair, so you\u2019ll usually get the nicest looking curls if you leave them in place overnight.",
        "If you don\u2019t have time to wait overnight for curls, leave the socks or rags in place for at least four to five hours.",
        "Keep them in as long as you can for the best results.",
        "Remove the socks or rags and comb with fingers.",
        "When you wake up the next morning, untie the socks or rags in your hair and remove them.",
        "Use your fingers to gently comb through the curls to loosen them as desired.",
        "If you use a brush on your curls, you\u2019ll wind up removing most of them and creating a wavy look instead.",
        "You may also want to add an anti-frizz product to your hair too.",
        "Use your fingers to smooth it through your hair so you don\u2019t disrupt the curls.",
        "Spray your curls with hairspray.",
        "Now that you\u2019ve got some beautiful curls, you want to make sure that they last as long as possible.",
        "Spritz them with a flexible hold hairspray to help lock them in place without making your hair feel too crunchy.",
        "If you don\u2019t like the feel of hairspray, you don\u2019t have to use it.",
        "Just be aware that your curls may start to fall by the end of the day.",
        "Using Braids or Buns to Curl Wet your hair.",
        "When you\u2019re curling with braids or buns, it\u2019s best to start with wet hair.",
        "Wash your hair as you normally would, and then towel dry it slightly so it\u2019s not dripping.",
        "If you don\u2019t want to wash your hair, use a spray bottle with water to get your locks fairly damp before you start the curling process.",
        "If your hair doesn\u2019t hold curls well, you may want to spray a texturizing spray on your wet hair before moving on.",
        "That added texture in your hair can help it curl more easily.",
        "Braid your hair or create buns.",
        "Braids and buns are quick, easy hairstyles, but the way that they twist your hair also means that they can add curls and waves to your locks.",
        "For looser waves, pull your hair back into a single braid or tie it up in a single bun.",
        "However, if you want tighter, more defined curls, divide your hair into sections and create several braids or buns all over your head..\nYou can curl your hair with traditional, French, or fishtail braids.",
        "Use whatever style is your favorite or the easiest for you to do.",
        "If you want the simplest style to create curls, divide your hair into two sections on either side of your head.",
        "Create one bun on each side and secure them in place with elastics for a Princess Leia-inspired look.",
        "You\u2019ll get loose, natural curls all over your hair without much effort.",
        "If you want an even easier way to create some curls or waves in your hair, gather it up as you would for a ponytail, twist it tightly, and use a shark clip to pin it to the back of your head.",
        "You\u2019ll get looser, less defined curls, but your hair will still have some texture when it dries.",
        "Allow your hair to dry completely.",
        "In order for the curls to take hold, your hair must dry completely.",
        "That\u2019s why you may prefer to braid your hair or put it in buns at night, so you can leave them in place overnight to ensure that they\u2019re totally dry.",
        "You don\u2019t necessarily have to start the process at night.",
        "Because braids and buns are hairstyles that you would wear out of the house, you can also go out while you\u2019re waiting for your hair dry and curl.",
        "If you need your curls in a hurry, you can help the drying process along by using a blowdryer on your hair.",
        "Style with your fingers.",
        "Once you\u2019re sure that your hair has dried completely, being taking out the braids or buns.",
        "Your curls will be somewhat fragile, so don\u2019t use a brush to help them in place.",
        "Instead, use your fingers to gently separate the curls and style them.",
        "While using braids or buns to curl your hair is usually used to get a natural look, you may want to spray your locks with some hairspray to help them stay in place all day.",
        "Creating Curls with Bobby Pins Apply a curl enhancing product.",
        "Start with clean, dry hair before you begin curling.",
        "Make sure that it is free of knots and tangles too.",
        "Next, apply a curl enhancing product to your locks to ensure that they will hold the curls.",
        "Curl enhancers come in a variety of formulas, but when you\u2019re doing pin curls, it\u2019s best to use a spray product.",
        "Divide your hair.",
        "To make it easier to curl and pin your hair, it helps to divide it.",
        "Depending on how thick and long your hair is, you may just want to separate it into two sections, one on either side of your head.",
        "If you have a lot of hair, though, you may find it easier to work with three or more sections\nUse hair elastics or clips to separate each section.",
        "That way, the other sections won\u2019t get in your way when you start to curl.",
        "Grab a section of hair at the top.",
        "To start your first curl, take a piece of hair from the top of the section you\u2019re working with.",
        "Keep in mind that the size of the section you take will determine what your final curls look like.",
        "A small section, approximately 1-inch or so, will result in tight curls.",
        "If you use larger sections, you\u2019ll wind up with looser curls.",
        "When you take hold of the section you\u2019re going to curl, brush it out to ensure that it\u2019s smooth, and spray it with some more of your curl enhancing product.",
        "Twist the hair back on itself to form a loop.",
        "Starting approximately 1-inch from the end of the section, begin rolling the hair back on itself to create a loop.",
        "It helps to use your finger to twist the hair back over to hold the curl shape in place as you work.",
        "Roll the section of hair all the way back toward your head, placing it flat against the scalp.",
        "Make sure to tuck the end of the hair into the loop to ensure that it\u2019s curled as well.",
        "Pin the curl in place.",
        "With the section of looped hair pressed to your scalp, use a bobby pin to secure the curl in place.",
        "Depending on how thick your hair is, you may need another bobby pin to keep the hair in place.",
        "Be sure to have plenty of bobby pins on hand.",
        "You don\u2019t want to have to go hunting for pins when you\u2019re trying to hold a curl in place.",
        "Repeat the process for your entire head.",
        "Once your first curl is pinned, you can move onto the rest of your hair.",
        "Complete the process for the first section of hair that you\u2019re working with, and then move on to the next section until your entire head is done.",
        "Make sure that you curl every piece of hair, so there are no random straight pieces when you\u2019re done.",
        "Be sure to do the top of each section first.",
        "It\u2019s more difficult to do the lower pieces if the top layer is in the way.",
        "Spritz curls with hairspray.",
        "When all of your hair is pinned, it\u2019s time to ensure that your curls will last all day once you take them done.",
        "Use a firm hold hairspray to mist your entire head.",
        "Ensure that you apply the spray evenly to every pinned curl so they\u2019ll all stay in place.",
        "Don\u2019t hold the hairspray too close to your hair when you\u2019re spraying or your hair may wind up feeling really hard and crunchy.",
        "Hold the bottle approximately 8-inches from your head while you\u2019re spritzing.",
        "Leave them in for several hours.",
        "To ensure that you get the best curls possible, you need to leave the pins in for at least several hours.",
        "Three or four hours can often be enough, but you\u2019ll get the best results if you leave the curls in place overnight.",
        "Because they\u2019re pinned flat against your head, pin curls are usually comfortable to sleep with.",
        "If you want to go out while you\u2019re waiting for your curls to set or keep the curls undisturbed while you sleep, fold a large scarf or bandana into a triangle and wrap it over your hair.",
        "Brush them out.",
        "When you think your curls have had time to properly set, being removing the pins and uncurling your hair.",
        "They\u2019ll be fairly tight when you first unroll them, so use your fingers to gently comb through and style them.",
        "If your curls are too tight, use a brush instead of your fingers to work through your hair.",
        "That will help smooth them so they have more of a wavy appearance."
