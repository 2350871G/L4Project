Dyeing Tulle in a Washing Machine Prewash your tulle. To remove any chemicals present on your fabric, run it through a simple wash cycle with detergent, using whatever settings you normally do for laundry. Do not use fabric softener as it may hamper the dyeing process by leaving a thin film on the tulle. Soak your tulle in hot water. To prepare your fabric for the dye mix, change your washer\u2019s temperature setting to hot, then use the soak option to thoroughly dampen the tulle.

Then, pour the mixture into the detergent slot to help your fabric soak up the dye. Pour in 1 cup (240 ml) of vinegar and another 2 cups (470 ml) of hot water if you\u2019re dyeing nylon or silk. Wash your tulle and dye in hot, high water. Choose the longest cycle available, making sure to select any extra rinse and spin options, then start the washer.

Once the cycle ends, mop up any extra dye with the towels. Determining What Dye You Need Use acid or all purpose dye to color nylon tulle. In order to tint properly, nylon tulle needs a significant amount of acid. You can accomplish this by purchasing full acid dyes, which use vinegar to gain their acidic qualities, or all purpose dyes, which mix acid dyes with other solutions. Get a disperse dye to tint polyester tulle. Polyester is one of the hardest fabrics to dye because it so heavily resembles plastic. However, you can do it with disperse dyes, a form of insoluble dye that is typically only available online or from specialty dye shops. Additionally, companies like RIT are starting to offer synthetic solutions that mimic the effects of disperse dye on polyester. Tint rayon tulle with cotton-friendly dyes. Rayon is very susceptible to dyes and you can color it with any chemical solution that works on cotton. This includes fiber reactive dyes, direct dyes, all purpose dyes, vat dyes, naphthol dyes, and natural dyes. Color silk tulle using almost any dye. More than even rayon, silk holds dye incredibly well and you can tint it with just about any kind. In particular, silk yields good results when submerged in fiber reactive dyes, acid dyes, direct dyes, and vat dyes.",
