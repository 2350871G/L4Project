                    "description": "Depending on how deeply embedded they are in the skin, splinters are not always easy to see right away. Your dog will probably let you know with his body language where the splinter is. For example, your dog may continually paw at his mouth to try to remove a splinter in a particular paw. He may also lick and bite at whichever area has the splinter. If your dog is holding up one of his legs or is hesitant to put weight on a certain paw, the splinter is probably in that paw. Splinters typically do not cause a lot of bleeding, so you may not be able to find the splinter by looking for a wound that\u2019s bleeding. In addition to using your eyes, use your hands to gently touch his paws to find exactly where the splinter is. Talk gently and softly with your dog while you are doing this to reassure him that he will be okay."

Use warm, soapy water and a clean towel to clean the area. The area where the splinter is located is probably very painful, so be gentle when you are cleaning the area. It may be helpful to fill a shallow bucket with the warm, soapy water. In this way, you could let your dog\u2019s paw soak in the water, which may feel very soothing to him. Use a small towel to clean his paw while it is soaking. Use another clean towel to dry his paw after you have cleaned it."

If the splinter is embedded too deeply into the skin, it will be very difficult to remove the splinter with your tweezers; if this is the case, you can sterilize a small needle and use the needle to pry the splinter up from under the skin. If you still cannot grip the splinter after using the needle, take your dog to your vet so that they can remove the splinter. Just like with cleaning your dog\u2019s paw, be gentle when you are removing the splinter. Your dog is going to be pain while you\u2019re doing this, so talk to him in gentle and soothing tones to reduce his anxiety. Be careful not to push the splinter further into the skin, or break the splinter, when trying to pull it out.

If the puncture wound is tiny, and the dog is now happy to stand on the paw, then do not bandage. Instead, ease back on his exercise for a couple of days, and bathe the paw in salty water after a walk in order to remove road grit. If after two days the area looks dry and clean, there is no pus or smelly discharge, and he is walking soundly, then you can return to normal. Bandaging would be needed if the puncture hole is large, there is a smelly discharge from the hole, your dog still isn't fully placing weight on his paw after several minutes, or you are not confident that the whole of the splinter came out."

Alternatively, you can apply the ointment directly to the affected area on your dog's paw. Neosporin is a triple antibiotic ointment for humans, but you can use it on your dog to treat the area from where you removed the splinter.
