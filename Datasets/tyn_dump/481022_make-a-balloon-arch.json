    "text": " Making a Basic Balloon Arch Find or create  a wire base. Use wire cutters to cut a long piece of sturdy wire to the length and height you want the arch to be. You can also purchase a balloon arch kit from the store, and use the wire frame from there. Because wire gets flimsier the longer you cut it, this method is best used for smaller arches. Anchor the arch. Stick the ends of the arch into a bucket filled with gravel, pebbles, or sand. If you bought a pre-made arch from the store, it may already have a flat, base or platform. In this case, place something heavy, such as a brick or cinderblock on the base to weigh it down. Add a thin layer of colored sand or pebbles to your bucket. This will hide the plain sand or pebbles. Wrap bricks or cinderblocks in paper that matches your balloons. You can also paint them to match the base of your balloon arch. Blow up four balloons with a balloon pump. They can all be the same color, or they can be different ones. Tie the tail end of each balloon into a knot as soon as you finish blowing it up. Try to make each balloon the same size. Use a regular pump for this method, not a helium tank. You don't have to use a balloon pump for this, but your lungs may get tired after a while. Tie two balloons together by the tails in a double-knot. If you are having trouble with this, you can tie the balloons together using string instead. Repeat this step for the remaining two balloons. You should now have two balloon pairs. Twist the balloon pairs together to make a clover shape. Place your first set of balloons over the second one in a cross shape. Pull the bottom two balloons upward. Pull the left one to the right, and the right one to the left. You will have something that looks like a four-leaf clover. Alternatively, you can tie the balloons together in a cross shape with some string. Tie or twist the balloons to your wire. Pull the balloon clover against the wire.

You can use all the same color or you can alternate colors. Stagger the balloons. Let the balloons in row two rest in the cracks between the balloons in row one. Making a Floating Arch Tie a long piece of fishing line to a balloon weight. Choose a balloon weight that matches your color scheme. Wrap the end of the fishing line a few times around the handle, then tie it into a secure knot. Don't tie down the other end yet. If you can't find any fishing line, use white string instead. You can also use balloon ribbon that matches your color scheme. If you are making a large balloon arch, tie the string to a bucket handle instead. Fill the bucket with sand, gravel or pebbles. You can also tie string to a cinderblock if you are making a large balloon arch. Inflate a balloon using a helium tank. Unlike other arches, this arch relies on floating balloons for structure. Blow up your first balloon using the tank, then tie off the tail end. You can buy a helium tank from a party supply store or an arts and crafts store. Some places will also allow you to rent them instead. Tie the fishing line to the balloon. Measure up abut 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) from your weight. Wrap the string around the tail end of the balloon, just above the knot, then tie it in a secure, double-knot. Continue inflating and tying the balloons to the string. Place the balloons close enough so that they bump against each other on the sides. Work from one end of the string to the other.

Making a Mounted Arch Use wire cutters to cut chicken wire for your arch. How long you cut the chicken wire depends on how wide and how tall you want your arch to be. If the chicken wire is very wide, you may want to cut it narrower. This will make it easier to bend and curve it into an arch shape. Bend the chicken wire into the shape you want it to be. It can be a perfect arch or a warped one. If you need to, loosely crumple or fold the wire in half lengthwise to make it thinner. Secure the arch to your wall.
