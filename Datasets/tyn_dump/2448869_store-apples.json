If the apples are too damaged for human consumption, you could also consider throwing them out into the woods for deer or other wildlife to enjoy. Even if no wild animal is interested, as the apples decay, they will provide a food source for various insects and other organisms living in the dirt."

This is the ideal temperature range for apples to be stored at. Storing them in colder conditions will cause the cells to break down, leading to mushy, inedible apples, and storing them in conditions that are warmer by only 10 degrees Fahrenheit (12.2 degrees Celsius) can cause the apples to ripen twice as quickly.
