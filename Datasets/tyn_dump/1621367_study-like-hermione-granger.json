(Apart from the first time she was called a Mudblood but we can live with that, because not everyone is made of solid rock.) To make a homework planner, grab a suitable lined book. Use a non-removable stickiness charm, or hot glue, and decorate the inside. Also, put a spell on it so it shouts out quotes at you whenever you open it or write quotes inside (that's what Hermione did for Ron and Harry in the books.) But make sure you can use these spells properly before attempting; if you haven't got a clue as a Muggle, you will have to use ink or coloured pen for the quotes and glue in some cool decorations that make it seem like a \"charmed\" book."

This can be done by having a certain colour for each of your classes/subjects, and purchasing a folder and book in that classes' specific colour.

Having Good Study Practices Take notes of everything. This means that when it does come time to study, you have all the information you need in front of you. Use notation forms that are useful for you; don't copy other forms unless you actually find them useful. It is often best to develop your own highlighting methods, your own shorthand, and your own summarizing techniques. Ask yourself questions on what you are reading. Doing this will indicate whether or not you understood what you have read. Read the passage or paragraphs. Brainstorm a few questions based on what you read. Read the passage or paragraph once more and answer the questions. Enjoying Your Studying Time Give yourself goals or rewards for studying if you don't like it. For example: \"After doing 30 minutes of math's study, I am allowed to have a small square of chocolate.\" It is also good to include physical movement breaks as a reward; for example, after 1-hour study, allow yourself a five-minute walk or stretch before coming back to the books. If you really don't like the subjects, write Potions instead of Science or maybe Maths to Arithmancy.  Have fun while you're studying. While this may be hard a lot of the time, try to inject enjoyment into some of the studying. If something really interests you, learn more about it in your own way and become more knowledgeable in it so that you can wow the teacher. Listen to some music.
