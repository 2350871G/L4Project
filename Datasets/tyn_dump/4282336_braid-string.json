    "text": " Making a Basic 3-Strand Braid Decide your braid's length. Figure out the length of your braid. Add on an extra 1/3 of that measurement to get your cutting length. This is how long you'll need to cut your string. For example:\nDesired length: 24 inches (61 cm)\n24 divided by 3 = 8 inches (20 cm)\n24 + 8 = 32 inches (81 cm)\n32 inches (81 cm) = cutting length Cut 3 pieces of string based on your measurements. Use the same color for each strand of string, or use different colors. For a fancier braid, cut 6 or 9 strings instead, then divide them into 3 groups. For example, you can do 3 pink strings, 3 purple strings, and 3 magenta strings. Embroidery floss is a popular choice, but you can use other types of string, such as yarn or leather cording. Knot your strings together. Gather the ends of your strings together. Treating them as a single strand, coil them into a loop, then pull the ends through the loop. This will make the knot. Keep the knot 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) from the string end. Tape the string above the knot to a flat surface, such as a table. Separate your string into 3 strands or groups. 1 strand to the left, 1 in the middle, and 1 on the right. With multiple strands of color, group the strands by color instead. For example, place the pink strings to the left, the purple strings in the middle, and all the magenta strings to the right. Start the braid. Take the left string and cross it over the middle string. Take the right string and cross it over the new middle string. Again, if you have multiple strings of each color, treat that color group as a single string. For example, if you have 3 pink, 3 purple, and 3 magenta strings, cross all of the pink strings over all of the purple strings. Maintain a consistent tension. Give the strings a gentle tug to tighten the strings as you braid. Repeat the process until you reach  the length you want, or until you have 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) left. Fasten the braid end into a knot. Coil the braid end into a loop, then pull the tails through the loop. Tug on the tails to tighten the knot, then trim off the left over strands, Remove the tape from the start of the braid. You can now use the braid for the craft project you created it for. If this is a bracelet, wrap the braid around your wrist and tie the ends together into a double-knot. Creating a 4-Strand Braid Decide your braid's length. Add an extra 1/3 of that measurement. to get your cutting length. For example:\nDesired length: 12 inches (30 cm)\n12 divided by 3 = 4 inches (10 cm)\n12 + 4 = 16 inches (41 cm)\n16 inches (41 cm) = cutting length Cut 4 pieces of string based on your measurement. Embroidery floss is a great choice here, but you can use other types of string, like jute or yarn. Use the same color for all 4 strands, or you can use different colors. For a wider 4-strand braid, cut 8 to 12 strands. These strands are divided into 4 groups later on. Knot the strings together, then tape them to a flat surface. Gather the strings together, then tie an overhand knot 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) from the end. Tape the strings to a flat surface, like a desk, just above the knot. An overhand knot is formed when you coil the string into a loop, then pull the end through the loop. Divide the strings into 4 groups. 2 strings to the left and 2 strings to the right. With 8 to 12 strings, you still divide the strings into 4 groups. Each color group is worked as a single strand from now on. Begin braiding. Starting from the left, mentally number the strings 1 through 4. Cross the 1st string on the left over the 2nd string. Continue the braid. Cross the last string on the right under the 3rd string. Re-number your strings 1 through 4. Take string number 4, and cross it under string number 3. Cross the 3rd string over the 2nd string. Re-number your strings one last time. Take string number 3, and cross it over string number 2. This process is a little bit like weaving. Repeat the process, starting from the 1st string on the left. Cross the 1st string over the middle string. Cross the 4th string under the 3rd string. Cross the new 3rd string over the new left string. Continue until your braid is the length you want, or until you have 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) left. Every so often, give all of your strings a tug so that your braid comes out nice and neat. Knot the end of the braid, then cut the rest off. Just like the braid start, tie the end of your braid into an overhand knot. If a lot of string is leftover, cut it off. Remove the tape from the start of the braid. To wear this as a bracelet, wrap the braid around your wrist, then have someone tie the ends together into a double-knot for you. Doing a 5-Strand Braid Cut 5 pieces of 32-inch (81-cm) length of string. Use the same color for each string, or use different colors. For a wider braid, cut 10 pieces of string; you will still be creating a 5-strand braid, but using 2 strings for each strand..\nYou can use this method to create a 7-strand braid. Embroidery floss works great for this, but you can also use yarn. Thicker string, such as jute or leather, is not recommended because of its bulk. Knot your strings together. Gather the ends of your strings. Treating them as a single strand, coil them into a loop, then pull the ends through the loop. This will make the knot. Keep the knot 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) from the string end. Tape the string above the knot to a flat surface, such as a desk or table. Divide your string into 5 groups. When using 10 strings for a thicker braid, divide them into 5 groups of 2 strands each. Treat each group as a single strand. Weave the first string under and over the next 2 strings. Take the 1st string on the left. Cross it under the 2nd and over the 3rd string. Drop it between the 3rd and 4th strings. For a dovetail look, cross the first strand over the next 2 strands and drop it in the center. If working a 7-strand braid, do the step above, then cross the string over the 4th string. Weave the last string under and over the previous 2 strings. Number your strings 1 through 5. Take string number 5, and weave it under string number 4. Cross it over string number 3, and drop it between strings 2 and 3. For a dovetail look, cross the last strand over the previous 2 strands and drop it in the center. For a 7-strand braid, complete the above step, then cross the string under the fourth string. Repeat the process until you get the length you want. Alternate between weaving the left and right strings towards the middle. Always start with the first string on the left and the last string on the right. Keep the strings flat and do not let them twist. You can braid all the way to the end of the string, or you can stop whenever you want to. If using all the string, leave 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) at the end for tying the knot. Tie the end of the braid into an overhand knot. This is the same knot that is used at the start of the braid. If any extra string is left over, you can cut it off. Peel the tape off. You can now use the braid for whatever craft project you made it for. You can even wrap it around your wrist and tie the ends into a double-knot.",

        "Continue until your braid is the length you want, or until you have 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) left.",
        "Every so often, give all of your strings a tug so that your braid comes out nice and neat.",
        "Knot the end of the braid, then cut the rest off.",
        "Just like the braid start, tie the end of your braid into an overhand knot.",
        "If a lot of string is leftover, cut it off.",
        "Remove the tape from the start of the braid.",
        "To wear this as a bracelet, wrap the braid around your wrist, then have someone tie the ends together into a double-knot for you.",
        "Doing a 5-Strand Braid Cut 5 pieces of 32-inch (81-cm) length of string.",
        "Use the same color for each string, or use different colors.",
        "For a wider braid, cut 10 pieces of string; you will still be creating a 5-strand braid, but using 2 strings for each strand..\nYou can use this method to create a 7-strand braid.",
        "Embroidery floss works great for this, but you can also use yarn.",
        "Thicker string, such as jute or leather, is not recommended because of its bulk.",
        "Knot your strings together.",
        "Gather the ends of your strings.",
        "Treating them as a single strand, coil them into a loop, then pull the ends through the loop.",
        "This will make the knot.",
        "Keep the knot 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) from the string end.",
        "Tape the string above the knot to a flat surface, such as a desk or table.",
        "Divide your string into 5 groups.",
        "When using 10 strings for a thicker braid, divide them into 5 groups of 2 strands each.",
        "Treat each group as a single strand.",
        "Weave the first string under and over the next 2 strings.",
        "Take the 1st string on the left.",
        "Cross it under the 2nd and over the 3rd string.",
        "Drop it between the 3rd and 4th strings.",
        "For a dovetail look, cross the first strand over the next 2 strands and drop it in the center.",
        "If working a 7-strand braid, do the step above, then cross the string over the 4th string.",
        "Weave the last string under and over the previous 2 strings.",
        "Number your strings 1 through 5.",
        "Take string number 5, and weave it under string number 4.",
        "Cross it over string number 3, and drop it between strings 2 and 3.",
        "For a dovetail look, cross the last strand over the previous 2 strands and drop it in the center.",
        "For a 7-strand braid, complete the above step, then cross the string under the fourth string.",
        "Repeat the process until you get the length you want.",
        "Alternate between weaving the left and right strings towards the middle.",
        "Always start with the first string on the left and the last string on the right.",
        "Keep the strings flat and do not let them twist.",
        "You can braid all the way to the end of the string, or you can stop whenever you want to.",
        "If using all the string, leave 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) at the end for tying the knot.",
        "Tie the end of the braid into an overhand knot.",
        "This is the same knot that is used at the start of the braid.",
        "If any extra string is left over, you can cut it off.",
        "Peel the tape off.",
        "You can now use the braid for whatever craft project you made it for.",
        "You can even wrap it around your wrist and tie the ends into a double-knot."
