                    "description": "A chaser is a drink that you can use to decrease the taste of the shot. Get a soda, juice, or beer to take with your shot. You will take a sip of the chaser right after you down the shot to remove the taste of the liquor from your tongue. Make sure you have your chaser ready before you take your shot. You can also take a small sip of the chaser before you take your shot and hold it in your mouth. Drink the shot, and then swallow the chaser and the shot at the same time. Once you have swallowed, take another sip of the chaser. Depending on the shot (i.e. tequila) you are taking, you may need to get your lemon, lime, or salt ready before you take the shot. Beer is the most commonly used chaser. Tequila can be chased with a light lager such as Tecate, Corona, or Pacifico. Bourbon pairs well with an imperial stout beer. Chase with any beer that you like or ask the bartender for a suggestion. If you are drinking whiskey, try using pickle juice as a chaser."

The shot glass should be upside-down when you are finished taking the shot. This motion will make it easier for you to get the shot down your throat. Be careful not to tilt your head too far back. You do not want to choke on the liquor. Make sure you tilt both your head and the shot glass. Titling only one of these can result in a mess. For example, if you tilt the glass but do not tilt your head back, you may spill the shot on your clothes."

Higher quality spirits not only taste better, but they also decrease your risk of a hangover. Opt for premium liquor when possible. Dark liquors (e.g. rum, whiskey, bourbon) contain larger amounts of congeners. The increased amount of these congeners can make you have a more severe hangover.
