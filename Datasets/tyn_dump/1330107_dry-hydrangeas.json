Save the silica gel in a plastic container for the next time you want to dry flowers. Store or display the dried hydrangeas. Carefully store the dried hydrangea blossoms in plastic bags until you're ready to use them or place them in a vase. Water Drying Prepare the flowers for drying. Remove all but a few leaves, and discard discolored petals. Cut the flower stems to your desired length. Fill a vase or container with a couple inches of water. Place the flowers stem-side down into the vase, so the stems are submerged at the end of the stem. Allow the flowers to dry. Your hydrangea will slowly dry as the water gradually evaporates. Place the vase out of direct sunlight, since strong sun can cause the flowers to shrivel or fade. Don't top off the water, since this may cause the flowers to mold before drying. The drying process should take one to two weeks. Remove the dried flowers. Trim the stems if they are moist or discolored from being submerged in the water. Store the flowers in a plastic bag or place them in a vase and display. Pressing Prepare the flowers for pressing. Pressing flowers preserves the color and shape of the petals, but the shape of the hydrangea blossom itself will be flattened. Cut the hydrangea blossoms in half to preserve and flatten their round shape. Cut individual flowers and plan to arrange them in the shape of a hydrangea blossom after they're dried. Prepare the press. A press is made with two pieces of plywood that are tightened with screws and wing nuts.

The cardboard and parchment paper should be cut a few inches smaller than the bottom of the press.

The top sheet of parchment paper anchors the flowers during the drying process. Lay the flowers on the top sheet of parchment paper. Arrange them so that no petals or folded or crushed, unless you are trying to create a windblown effect. A little layering is fine, but don't build too many layers of petals, or they won't dry out correctly. If you wish, add other foliage like leaves, ferns and other flowers. Finish assembling the flower press. Cover the flowers with a sheet of parchment paper, a second \"blotter\" sheet, a piece of cardboard, and the top piece of the flower press. Screw the plywood pieces together and tighten them with the wing nuts. Allow the flowers to dry. Set the press in a dry place in your home and let the drying process begin. Open the press and change out the blotter sheets every few days. Discard the old sheets and replace them with fresh ones. After a week or two, the flowers should be completely dry. Remove them from the press. Lift the pressed flowers from the parchment paper. They are now ready to use in craft projects such as cards or jewelry.
