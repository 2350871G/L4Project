                    "description": "It is caused by an imbalance between milk supply and infant demand. In other words, your breasts are producing more milk than is being consumed by your baby. Breast engorgement can occur in the early days of breastfeeding, as your body is establishing how much milk needs to be stored in order to feed your baby. Breast engorgement can also occur when you are weaning off of breastfeeding, and even night-weaning. As you diminish your baby's consumption of milk, your breasts will take some time to adjust and to produce less milk. It can also occur when your baby is sick, as he or she will tend to feed less during these times. Finally, breast engorgement is common in women who have chosen not to breastfeed, as their breasts adjust to the fact that they will not need to continue producing milk."

Symptoms of prolonged breast engorgement after the first 2-5 days include:\nbreasts that are swollen, firm, and painful\nflattened, hard areolas (the darker part of the breast around the nipple).

Plugged milk ducts generally means symptoms of redness, lumpiness, and/or increased pain in the breast secondary to too much milk. It is basically a more serious form of breast engorgement, and you are also more prone to developing an infection in the breast when you have poor milk flow (called \"mastitis\"). Plugged ducts can also occur for other reasons (where the duct is truly blocked by something else, other than just milk), but this is less common. If you suspect you may have plugged milk ducts or mastitis (both have similar symptoms, but mastitis usually has the added symptom of a fever and/or chills), it is important to see your doctor promptly for treatment. You may need to take an antibiotic. If you do not treat mastitis promptly, it can turn into an abscess that could require disfiguring surgery to treat."

        "Avoid pumping if you can.",
        "Although a little bit of pumping if you are in a lot of pain can sometimes be of help, in general it is a bad strategy as it encourages your breasts to produce more milk.",
        "This can exacerbate the problem rather than solve it.",
        "Whether you are weaning off of breastfeeding, or not breastfeeding to begin with, trust that if you give your breasts the signal \"less (or no) milk is needed right now\" by resisting the urge to pump, they will adjust to produce only the required amount of milk.",
        "Avoid certain things when dealing with breast engorgement.",
        "These include:\nHeat or warmth to the breasts, as this encourages milk production.",
        "Stimulation or massage to your breasts, as this also encourages milk production.",
        "Try medication.",
        "Use ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol) as needed to alleviate pain and discomfort in the breasts.",
        "These are available over-the-counter at any pharmacy."
