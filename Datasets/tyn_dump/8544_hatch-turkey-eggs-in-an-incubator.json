                    "description": "There are a few different styles of incubators, but they all work the same way. The most basic part of choosing an incubator is getting the right size. Turkeys lay an average of 2 to 3 eggs per week, so factor in how many turkeys you have and how many eggs you plan on hatching. Then, pick a style of incubator according to your preferences and budget. Still air incubators are often inexpensive and good for small batches of eggs. They don\u2019t have circulating air, so you need to open the door every day to let in oxygen, adjust the temperature, and turn the eggs. Forced air incubators have a fan that keeps the air even throughout the incubator. Many of them are programmable and have automatic turning racks to help keep growing turkeys healthy. Most incubators have slots you put individual eggs in, so you know exactly how much space you have. Incubators work for chickens or any other type of bird, so you don\u2019t need to look for something turkey-specific."

Store the eggs in a cool place, such as a pantry or cupboard, until the incubator is ready. Cool temperatures arrest the turkey\u2019s growth. Let the eggs warm back up to room temperature for 4 to 8 hours before incubating them. Most likely, your incubator is a forced air incubator, which has a fan that distributes air evenly.
