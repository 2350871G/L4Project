    "text": " Printing on Transfer Paper Purchase T-shirt transfer paper. Transfer paper can be found anywhere you can buy stationary or printer paper. There are two types of transfer paper, one suitable for white or pastel shirts, and one suitable for all darker colors. Most transfer paper is the same size as your regular printer paper (Letter size or A4 depending on your country). Before purchasing an unusual size, make sure your printer can handle it. Light transfer paper is used for light or white shirts. Dark transfer paper is used for any shirt that is darker. Select an image. You can use any image saved on your computer. If you only have the image in a physical form, scan it and save it to your computer as a jpeg file. Alternatively, take a photograph and transfer it to your computer.

One side may have a logo, design, or thermal indicators on it. Switch to \"landscape mode\" if the image is wider than it is tall. Cut out the image. Any paper you leave around the image will show up as a thin film on the shirt. To create a clean image, cut out the image. To get an accurate cut, use a ruler and an Exacto knife. Cover a hard, flat surface with a cotton pillowcase. Clear a table or countertop, then clean and dry it if necessary. Lay a cotton pillowcase over this surface, covering enough space to lay out the area of your T-shirt you'll be printing. Most ironing boards are not suitable, due to the metal bars or grating on the surface. Use a surface that can withstand heat. Don't try to iron over a laminate countertop.

Let it cool for at least a few minutes, until the paper reaches room temperature. Peel off the paper to reveal your image underneath. Transferring an Image with Photo Emulsion Screen Printing Select a black and white image. You need a black and white image because the black will block out the light allowing your design to show up on your silk screen. This printing method can only print black images onto the shirt. If you have a color image in mind, convert it into black and white using Microsoft Word, Photoshop, or another photo editing application. Print the image onto a transparency. You can purchase acetate paper from specialized screen printing supply stores, but clear transparency sheets from office supply stores work fine. Print the image onto the transparency sheet. Low-quality printers may not make the image completely opaque, which can lead to a messy image on the shirt. If necessary, take the transparencies to a copy store instead. Some transparency sheets will shrink or warp when they go through the printer. Buy a small pack to start with, so you can switch to a different brand if the first attempt doesn't work out. Paint a photo emulsion on a printing screen. These materials are available online or at large craft stores, often as part of a single screen printing kit. Paint both sides of the screen with the photo emulsion, using a squeegee to spread it a thin, even layer across the whole surface. Wear gloves while handling the photo emulsion. You also may want to lay a garbage bag down so that you don\u2019t get any paint on your table or another surface. Cover an area slightly larger than your photo and spread the emulsion out evenly.

Expose the image at your light station. The timing of this step is tricky to get right on your first try since it varies based on the intensity of the light. Typically, the image is ready once the photo emulsion has changed to a dull grey-green. Check your photo emulsion product for instructions, since the timing can vary from 2 to 90 minutes depending on light intensity. Wash the screen. Remove the glass and transparency and quickly bring the screen to the sink or a hose. Apply a powerful spray of cold water for several minutes to the recessed side of your screen.

Add a small dollop of screen printing ink to the top of the screen, and pull it across with a squeegee to form a thin layer. Go over this several times to ensure an even layer. Lift the screen without moving it against the shirt. Heat set the shirt. Most screen printing inks need to be ironed onto the shirt at a hot, dry setting. Others may only require an hour in sunlight, or a quick run through an ultraviolet drying machine. Check your ink label for specific instructions before you heat set. Once the image has dried, your shirt is ready to wear! Printing on Your Shirt with Inkodye Lay your shirt on a flat surface and iron it. To get the best results, you should iron your shirt to smooth out any wrinkles that could mess up the ink transfer. Inkodye works best with cotton shirts so be sure to set your iron to the cotton setting. Iron the shirt until you\u2019ve removed all wrinkles, especially on and around the area you plan to print on. Use a dry ironing method without steam. Insert a piece of foam core or cardboard into your shirt. Place the cardboard inside your shirt and smooth out the area again. Cardboard works well because it\u2019s flat and won\u2019t let the ink bleed through to the other side of the shirt. Plus, when you\u2019re done, you can just throw it away. Create a frame where you want to place the image. You can use a piece of cardboard or plastic frame that you\u2019ve made or simply use blue painter\u2019s tape to tape off the area. The area inside your frame is where you\u2019ll paint on the ink. The frame ensures that no ink gets outside of the area. If you don\u2019t want any extra inked area around your photo, use a frame that\u2019s slightly smaller than your image. A smaller frame ensures that the ink won\u2019t bleed out past your photo. Make sure not to tape the image down. It will get stuck. And run your fingernail along the taped edges if you used tape you ensure there are no gaps. Pour your Inkodye into a bowl. Make sure to shake the bottle well before pouring the ink. Make sure that your bowl isn\u2019t absorbent, you don\u2019t want the dye seeping into it. Try to do this in a ventilated room that isn\u2019t exposed to a lot of natural light. About 2.5 tablespoons (40 ml) can coat an 11X11\u201d cotton square. Apply the Inkodye to your shirt. Coat your brush or roller with the dye. Use the edges of your bowl to get excess dye of your brush so there\u2019s not dripping or blotting. Evenly apply the dye to your desired area on your shirt. Don\u2019t soak your shirt. Inkodye is fairly colorless so pay close attention to how much you are applying. After you\u2019ve covered the desired area, grab a paper towel and blot the area to soak up any excess dye. Remove the frame to see the painted area. Once you\u2019ve covered the area you no longer need your frame. You can keep the frame on if you used tape and you think some of the dye may have bled through. Place your negative on the inked part of the shirt. You can press down your negative onto your shirt to help it stick to the dyed area. Smooth out the area with your hand. You want your negative to make good contact everywhere with the dye. Use straight pins on the edges of your negative to keep it in place. Alternatively, you can place a piece of acetate over the top of your negative. Expose your print to direct sunlight. You now want to bring your shirt with the negative on it outside and let it soak up the sun to dry and transfer the image. Expose your print to direct sunlight for 10-15 minutes. It\u2019s best to do this when the sun is strongest around 11:00 am to 3:00 pm. You may have to expose your print for longer if it\u2019s cloudy out. After about five or so minutes you\u2019ll begin to see the image darken. Remove the negative. It\u2019s best to remove the negative in a space that isn\u2019t very bright. Removing the negative in subdued lighting will help to keep the print intact. Wash your shirt. It\u2019s best to wash your shirt in the washing machine, but you can hand wash it as well. Washing will remove any extra Inkodye from your shirt and make your print look nice and fresh. Use warm to hot water for best results. You may want to wash it twice to remove all the residue. After your shirt is clean, it\u2019s ready to wear!",
