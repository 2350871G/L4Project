Collating Digital Documents Download your PDF management software. Collating digital documents usually requires merging PDF documents. You can purchase and download Adobe Acrobat, which is the industry standard, or you can download a free program, like PDFBinder. Always make sure you are downloading programs from a trusted site. Adobe and CNET are good locations to get reviews and download software programs. Install the program. Double click on it in your Downloads folder.

It may also mean gathering PDFs from different sources and placing them in a logical order for the multi-page PDF you create. Open the program. Either drag and drop the PDFs into the program or choose the option to create and combine files. Position them in the order you would like to see them. Most multi-page PDF creators allow you to move the order up and down until it is perfected. Press the \u201cBind\u201d button or the \u201cCombine Files\u201d button. Save the multi-page PDF under one name in an easy-to-access location. Open your file. Make sure it is collated in the right order. Send or print as required. Collating By Hand Place page numbers on the documents before they are printed. If you can\u2019t do this, you will need to identify them by sight according to their subtitles, starting sentences or other individual characteristics. Print copies of the report one page number at a time. Set each element to print one at a time. You can also simply uncheck the \u201ccollate\u201d box on your computer if you\u2019d rather print it uncollated and do it by hand. Separate each feature of the document into a separate pile. Lay it on a large workspace or on the floor. Place the piles in order in a semicircle around you. You can order them from left to right or right to left, depending upon your preferred direction. Gather one page of each element, moving across the semi-circle. When you get to the end, bind the collated copy with a staple, in a folder or with a paper clip. Repeat until all your copies are collated. ",
