    "text": " Making a Large Toy Car Find a rectangular cardboard box that you or a child can sit inside. Before you select a box to use, make sure the person you\u2019re making the car for can fit inside it. If you\u2019re making a car for a toddler or a small child, most large moving boxes will be sufficient. You can find large cardboard boxes for purchase at most home improvement stores. Tape the bottom of the cardboard box closed. It\u2019s best to use clear packing tape, but masking tape will also work. Use enough tape to cross the box\u2019s bottom lengthwise 2 or 3 times. Close the top of the box but leave out 1 of the short flaps. Fold 1 of the short flaps inside the box and leave the other 1 outside the box. Then, tape the 2 long flaps together to close the top of the box. The short flap that you leave outside of the box will be back of the car. Measure and mark the long sides of the box into thirds. Use a yardstick to measure the length of your box and divide that length into thirds. Then, use a pencil to draw 3 equally-sized sections on each of the box\u2019s 2 long sides. The middle section will be where you\u2019ll put the car\u2019s doors. Use a box cutter to cut the sides of the box\u2019s top to create a flap. Starting from the back of your box, cut 1 side of the box\u2019s top to separate it from the box\u2019s side. Stop cutting when you reach the front third of the box. Then, make the same cut on the other side of the box. By the end of this step, the back two-thirds the top should be separated from the sides of the box. Have an adult help you make the cuts with a box cutter. Fold the top flap in half and tape it together. Measure the height of the flap and mark its center with a horizontal line so you can get an even fold. Fold the top flap inward so that the inside crease is facing the inside of the box. Tape the 2 halves of the top flap together horizontally with packing tape. Do the same with the back flap. Fold the back flap in half just like you did with the top half. Secure the 2 halves together by wrapping packing tape around them horizontally. Paint the outside of the box if you want. You can either paint your car red, blue, black, or another color, or leave the exterior as is. Use acrylic paints and a paint brush or spray paint.

If you want the door to swing open, don\u2019t cut along the vertical line nearest to the front of the car. Add windshields and windows to your car. You can either make windshields and windows for your car by cutting sections out of the cardboard or by drawing them on. To make the front and back windshields, measure 1\u20133 inches (2.5\u20137.6 cm) from the sides of the front and back flaps and then draw a rectangle.

Or you can use the bottom part of a paper cup. You can use small, rectangular cardboard strips covered in duct tape or ice pop sticks spray-painted silver to make a grill. Using different colored markers to add lights and other details is another option. Creating a Cardboard Model Car Draw the 2 identical outlines of a car\u2019s profile on 2 pieces of cardboard. Select the style of car you want to emulate. You can make your car as small or large as you\u2019d like. If you don\u2019t have a size in mind, try making a car 6\u20139 inches (15\u201323 cm) in length. A good rule of thumb is to make the car\u2019s height 1/3 its length. Be sure to draw half circles where the 2 wheel wells should be. Cut out the 2 outlines with a box cutter. Put the cardboard on a cutting board or other hard surface. Then, carefully cut the outlines out. If you don\u2019t have a box cutter, you can also try using a strong pair of scissors. Use a hot-glue gun to glue the 2 side pieces to a bottom piece. First, measure and cut out a rectangular piece of cardboard that is the same length of the sides you cut out and has a width about equal to the car\u2019s height. Then, apply glue along the bottom of the 2 sides. Gently position the sides on the top of the rectangular piece and hold them in place until the glue dries. Make a roof for your car with another piece of cardboard. Start by measuring the top of the car. Then, transfer these dimensions onto another piece of cardboard and cut it out with a box cutter. Line the tops of the side pieces with glue and gently press and hold the top segments in place. To accurately measure curved edges, use a string and then check the string\u2019s length on a ruler. If the top of your car is curvy, you may need to use your fingers to bend the cardboard segment into shape. Make room for the wheels by cutting small rectangles out of the car\u2019s bottom. Once the frame of the car is glued together, flip it over. Then, cut out small rectangular pieces where the bottom piece meets the wheel wells. Trace out the wheels with a bottle cap. Place a bottle cap on a piece of cardboard and trace around it to make a circle and then cut the circle out. Repeat this 7 times to make 8 circular pieces. Glue 2 circular pieces to make 1 wheel. Put a skewer through 2 of the wheels. Use your box cutter to punch a small hole through 1 of the wheels. Once, you\u2019ve made a hole, fill it with glue and stick the skewer inside. Repeat this step with 1 other wheel. Cut the tip off the skewer before you put it into the wheel. Slide a segment of plastic straw over the 2 skewers. Cut a segment of a plastic straw that is equal to the width between the wheel wells on your car. Then, slide it onto 1 of skewers that\u2019s attached to a wheel. Do the same with the other skewer. Slide the other 2 wheels on the ends of the skewers to complete your axles. Use your box cutter to poke a hole in the 2 wheels that aren\u2019t yet attached to a skewer. Then, fill the holes with glue and slide them onto the skewer. Cut any part of the skewer that sticks outside of the wheel. Leave 1\u20132 centimetres (0.39\u20130.79 in) between this wheel and the plastic straw so that your wheels will be able to spin. Attach a rectangular piece of cardboard to the space between the wheel wells. Measure the width of the wheel wells and length of the distance between them. Then, transfer these dimensions onto a piece of cardboard and cut out 2 identical rectangular pieces. Use your glue gun to glue 1 piece between each the front and the back wheel wells. Affix the axles onto these rectangular pieces with glue. Line the center of each rectangular piece with glue. Then, press the axle into place and hold it down until the glue dries. Add any details you\u2019d like. You can paint your car or draw designs on it. Add headlights, a license plate, windows, and windshields to make it look more realistic.",

        "You can use paint, cardboard pieces, and other craft items to create the look you want.",
        "To make headlights, for example, you can cut small circles out of another piece of cardboard, paint them yellow, and then glue them onto the front of the car.",
        "Or you can use the bottom part of a paper cup.",
        "You can use small, rectangular cardboard strips covered in duct tape or ice pop sticks spray-painted silver to make a grill.",

        "A good rule of thumb is to make the car\u2019s height 1/3 its length.",
        "Be sure to draw half circles where the 2 wheel wells should be.",
        "Cut out the 2 outlines with a box cutter.",
        "Put the cardboard on a cutting board or other hard surface.",
        "Then, carefully cut the outlines out.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a box cutter, you can also try using a strong pair of scissors.",
        "Use a hot-glue gun to glue the 2 side pieces to a bottom piece.",
        "First, measure and cut out a rectangular piece of cardboard that is the same length of the sides you cut out and has a width about equal to the car\u2019s height.",
        "Then, apply glue along the bottom of the 2 sides.",
        "Gently position the sides on the top of the rectangular piece and hold them in place until the glue dries.",
        "Make a roof for your car with another piece of cardboard.",
        "Start by measuring the top of the car.",
        "Then, transfer these dimensions onto another piece of cardboard and cut it out with a box cutter.",
        "Line the tops of the side pieces with glue and gently press and hold the top segments in place.",
        "To accurately measure curved edges, use a string and then check the string\u2019s length on a ruler.",
        "If the top of your car is curvy, you may need to use your fingers to bend the cardboard segment into shape.",
        "Make room for the wheels by cutting small rectangles out of the car\u2019s bottom.",
        "Once the frame of the car is glued together, flip it over.",
        "Then, cut out small rectangular pieces where the bottom piece meets the wheel wells.",
        "Trace out the wheels with a bottle cap.",
        "Place a bottle cap on a piece of cardboard and trace around it to make a circle and then cut the circle out.",
        "Repeat this 7 times to make 8 circular pieces.",
        "Glue 2 circular pieces to make 1 wheel.",
        "Put a skewer through 2 of the wheels.",
        "Use your box cutter to punch a small hole through 1 of the wheels.",
        "Once, you\u2019ve made a hole, fill it with glue and stick the skewer inside.",
        "Repeat this step with 1 other wheel.",
        "Cut the tip off the skewer before you put it into the wheel.",
        "Slide a segment of plastic straw over the 2 skewers.",
        "Cut a segment of a plastic straw that is equal to the width between the wheel wells on your car.",
        "Then, slide it onto 1 of skewers that\u2019s attached to a wheel.",
        "Do the same with the other skewer.",
        "Slide the other 2 wheels on the ends of the skewers to complete your axles.",
        "Use your box cutter to poke a hole in the 2 wheels that aren\u2019t yet attached to a skewer.",
        "Then, fill the holes with glue and slide them onto the skewer.",
        "Cut any part of the skewer that sticks outside of the wheel.",
        "Leave 1\u20132 centimetres (0.39\u20130.79 in) between this wheel and the plastic straw so that your wheels will be able to spin.",
        "Attach a rectangular piece of cardboard to the space between the wheel wells.",
        "Measure the width of the wheel wells and length of the distance between them.",
        "Then, transfer these dimensions onto a piece of cardboard and cut out 2 identical rectangular pieces.",
        "Use your glue gun to glue 1 piece between each the front and the back wheel wells.",
        "Affix the axles onto these rectangular pieces with glue.",
        "Line the center of each rectangular piece with glue.",
        "Then, press the axle into place and hold it down until the glue dries.",
