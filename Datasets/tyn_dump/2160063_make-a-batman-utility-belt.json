The oval should be roughly 4\" across and 3\" tall. The ring should be the same dimensions of the oval but with the middle cut out.

Glue the ring onto the edges of the oval to create a border. Glue the Batman symbol onto the center of the oval. Allow the glue to dry. Making the Pouches Get the materials needed. To make the pouches, you'll need 5mm foam, scissors, a X-Acto knife, cardboard or cardstock, a ruler, velcro, and super glue. Use yellow foam if you want a yellow Batman utility belt, and black foam for an all black belt. Create a pattern. A basic pouch is made out of three foam pieces. The first piece is a long rectangle that is folded to form the front, back, and top flap. The other two pieces are shorter and narrower rectangles that function as the sides. To create the first piece, make a pattern piece out of cardboard or cardstock that is 10.5 inches long and 4 inches wide.

Trace each pattern piece onto the foam 4 to 6 times. Use scissors to cut out all the pieces. If you have more room on your belt, you can always make more pouches. You may need to round the edges of the side pieces with scissors so that they fit. Glue the pieces together to form pouches. Prior to construction the pouches, you must determine the flap length.

Glue one side of the velcro onto the inside of the front flap. Place a small amount of glue onto the other side of the velcro. Carefully fold the flap onto the front of the pouch and hold it firmly in place. Once the glue has dried, rip apart the velcro. Constructing the Utility Belt Use found objects for canisters. If you want to add canisters, you can use a number of different objects. You can use film roll canisters, or pill bottles, or some other cylindrical object that would fit on a belt. Get a belt. You'll want a thick leather belt to attach everything to. If you think you'll want to paint the whole thing yellow, it doesn't matter what color the belt is. If you want your Batman utility belt to be all black or have yellow pouches on a black belt, look for a black leather belt. Glue the pouches, buckle, and optional canisters to the belt. You'll want to use super glue of some sort to glue everything to the belt. Krazy glue will work. Don't paint anything until it's all glued on, as glue doesn't stick to painted surfaces as well.
