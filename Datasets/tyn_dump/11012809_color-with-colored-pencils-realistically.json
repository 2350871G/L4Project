Layering refers to the process of applying multiple colors on top of one another. To start layering, you\u2019ll want to start with a base layer. Then, add additional layers of different colors on top to create shades, texture, or form. Using different techniques while layering will prove to be an essential part of creating realistic images."

To use the back and forth stroke, angle your colored pencil towards your paper at 45 degrees and apply pressure evenly while drawing continuously over an area. Practice keeping each stroke relatively straight. This will keep your shading even and uniform. This is probably how you started drawing when you were younger. You just probably never knew the name for it! If you want to make certain areas darker while using the back and forth stroke, change the amount of pressure you\u2019re applying to the paper."

This technique is typically used to layer a single color with another color in instances where you want to create uneven or jagged textures. The texture you create when scumbling changes based on the pressure you\u2019re applying and on the size of circles that you\u2019re creating. You can also scumble by using figure-eights to create a smoother texture. Similarly, you can scumble by using shaky lines to create a rougher texture."

Cross-hatching refers to two layers of hatching that rest on top of one another, typically at right angles. To use the hatching or cross-hatching technique, rapidly create straight lines by moving your whole wrist and lifting your pencil off of the page after each stroke. You typically want to keep your lines as straight as possible to ensure a uniform pattern. Hatching is often used to create unique forms and add volume to a shape."

Stippling is one of the easier methods to use, since it only involves making a series of small dots with your pencil, but it can be rather time consuming. Stippling can be impressive because it adds a unique weight to each object in a drawing. Just keep in mind that it can take a long time if you\u2019re using it to create an entire piece!"

        "Landscapes typically have a wide range of one or two colors (usually green and blue), which means that you\u2019ll want to layer multiple shades to create the dynamic ranges that you\u2019re looking for.",
        "Avoid applying color to objects in your foreground at first.",
        "This will help you later on when you add objects to your foreground.",
        "For skies, the darkest part of the drawing should likely be where the sky meets the horizon.",
        "Add color to the objects in the foreground.",
        "Begin by layering base colors before moving on to more intricate details.",
        "Select your technique based on the object you\u2019re drawing.",
        "A tree bark\u2019s texture might require a mix of stippling and scumbling, while the side of a bare hill may only require some simple back and forth strokes.",
        "You don\u2019t need to know what every single stroke going to be.",
        "The key when layering colored pencils is to make layers of color the right size and texture to achieve a certain shape.",
        "The closer you are to the foreground, the more detail and value you want in your drawing.",
        "Use darker colors and apply pressure to create shadows.",
        "Keeping your source of light in mind, press firmly with darker colors to create shadows and add smaller details.",
        "Shadows don\u2019t necessarily need to be black.",
        "For example, the shadow on a blade of grass is probably going to be a darker green."
