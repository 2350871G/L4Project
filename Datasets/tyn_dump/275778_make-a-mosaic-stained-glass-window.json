Hold the glass firmly in position with 1 hand and use your other hand to press the blade of the knife along the glass to cut it. Purchase different coloured panes of glass from a craft store or from a hardware store. If you want a random mosaic, simply hit the glass with a hammer to break it into unique pieces. If you find it easier, draw your mosaic on a piece of paper and then use this as a guide to cut out each piece.

A little blank space between each piece can look effective as it helps to create contrast between the pieces. Arrange the different coloured glass in a pattern or a colour scale. For example, use a series of different shades of purple to create a calming colour scale. Alternatively, opt for clashing colours, such as blue and red, to create a striking look."
