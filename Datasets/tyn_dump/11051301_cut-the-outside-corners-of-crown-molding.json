Use spare 1 by 4 in (2.5 by 10.2 cm) boards rather than trying to find the angle on the crown molding itself in case you make a mistake.Tip: Though it seems like you should be able to cut the edge of each piece of crown molding to a 45-degree angle so they line up evenly, this rarely works. Most walls are not perfectly square, so using this strategy will often leave a gap between the pieces or cause them to line up incorrectly."

Position one board flush against the ceiling so it extends along the length of the wall past the outside corner. Position the other board flush against the ceiling so it extends along the length of the other wall past the outside corner, overlapping the first board. Use spare 1 by 4 in (2.5 by 10.2 cm) boards rather than trying to find the angle on the crown molding itself in case you make a mistake.Tip: Though it seems like you should be able to cut the edge of each piece of crown molding to a 45-degree angle so they line up evenly, this rarely works. Most walls are not perfectly square, so using this strategy will often leave a gap between the pieces or cause them to line up incorrectly. Trace the top board onto the bottom board to find the angle. Use a pencil or marker to trace both edges of the top board onto the board beneath it. Take the boards down and use a straightedge to draw a diagonal line between the 2 marks on the bottom board. Use a protractor to find the angle of the diagonal line. Cut through both boards at the correct angle and test-fit them to the wall. Stack the marked 1 by 4 in (2.5 by 10.2 cm) board on top of the other one and put them flat beneath the miter saw blade. Set the saw to the angle of the diagonal line and cut through both boards. Hold the boards up to against the wall so the top edges are flush to the ceiling and the mitered edges meet each other at the outside corner of the wall.

Test them again and then lock the miter saw to the correct angle. Making Your Cuts Mark each piece of molding to the correct length.
