Rinsing the chickpeas will wash away the flavor of the canning water, freshening up and improving the taste of your final dish. The easiest way to rinse them is to pour them into a colander and run them under cold water until they stop foaming. If you're  cooking your own chickpeas from scratch, you'll need soak the chickpeas overnight to get them soft enough to cook. After soaking, drain the water, add fresh water and cook the chickpeas at a simmer until they're fork tender. Drain the water and rinse the chickpeas - now they're ready to use."
