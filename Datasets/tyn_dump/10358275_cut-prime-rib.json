This is the single eye end of the cut. The other thicker end will be larger and have more fat running through it.While you can use either end of the cut, consider using the smaller end if you're serving fewer people or want a leaner roast. If you're serving a crowd, you may want a roast that includes more of the larger end. You'll also need to decide how many rib bones to include in your roast. For example, to feed a large number of people, consider cutting a 5 rib roast."
