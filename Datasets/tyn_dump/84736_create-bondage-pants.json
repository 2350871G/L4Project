If you can find a pair of black pants, not jeans, that have lots of rivets on them, that's all the better. Lots of pockets won't hurt either.",

You can also just put the pants on and wrap all the loose fabric back really tight then, using safety pins, pin the loose fabric tight against your leg.  Using Stitches Get a good pair of black pants.  Get some black 1\u20131.5 inch (2.5\u20133.8 cm) webbing.  If you're really slick, attach zippers so that they access the pockets already on the pants. The zippers are easy to attach just by doing a neat stitch to hold them down. Pin them in place before you start stitching. You might even want to try the pants on and mark with a safety pin exactly where you want them. Put D rings on all the belt loops to maximize strap possibilities, also attach them along the outer side seams. Place one pair just below your waist and one just below you knee.
