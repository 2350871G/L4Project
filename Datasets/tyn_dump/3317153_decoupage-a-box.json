Paint the gesso on in a single, even layer, trying to go the same direction along each side. Once it's dry, add a layer of acrylic paint the same way if you'd like. A primer can make it easier for your paper to stick, particularly with wood or slick boxes (such as cereal boxes) but it's not strictly necessary. However, if you plan to leave some areas blank when you add your paper decorations, you may want to paint the box a color of your choosing. In that case, you should prime it first.
