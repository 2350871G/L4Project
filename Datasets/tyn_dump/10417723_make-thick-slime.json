                    "description": "Run the water into a measuring cup until you have exactly 1 cup (240 mL). Add the Borax powder to the water, then stir the mixture until the powder dissolves completely. Set the Borax solution aside. The Borax is the \u201cactivator\u201d for your slime, causing the glue to go from a sticky liquid to a spongy semi-solid goo that retains its shape when squished, squeezed, and stretched. If you don\u2019t want to use Borax, you can also substitute an equal amount of a contact lens solution containing boric acid, which will create a similar chemical reaction when combined with the glue. There's no need to mix contact lens solution with water since it's already a liquid. Adding 1\u20132 tablespoons (15\u201330 mL) can make your slime a little stretchier, though."
