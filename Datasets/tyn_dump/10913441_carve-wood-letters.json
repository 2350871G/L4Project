Make sure there are no warps or defects in the wood you select or else you may have more difficulty carving it. If you\u2019ve carved wood before, you can try using hardwoods, like maple, cherry, or red oak. When you use hardwoods, you will need to carve slower and use more force to chip pieces off."

Block letters work best for carving out, but you can also use thin lettering if you want. Don\u2019t press too hard with your pencil since it could dent the wood or be hard to erase later on.Tip: Try using a white pencil on darker woods so you can see your lines easier."

Use clear tape to secure the printed letters to the light side of a piece of carbon paper. Set the paper on top of your wood so the dark side of the carbon paper faces down. Trace the outlines of your letters slowly with a pencil to transfer them onto your wood. You can buy carbon paper at an office supply store or online.

        "Start by making shallow carves along your letter outlines.",
        "Cut around the outside of your lines to make the letters 3D, or carve the inside of your letters to make them inset.",
        "Keep working around your outlines until you\u2019ve completed your carve.",
        "Work in one direction while you carve your wood or else it might look inconsistent.",
        "Change the bit you\u2019re using to change the size of your carve.",
        "Use smaller bits for finer lines and larger ones to carve more wood from the area.Tip: Try holding the rotary tool at an angle or sideways to carve out a larger line in your wood.",
        "Wipe sawdust away frequently.",
        "As you use your rotary tool, sawdust will start building up in your cuts and on your work surface.",
        "Once every 4-5 carves you make, wipe the wood clean with your hands or shake it out so you can see where you\u2019re working.",
        "Cleaning helps you make sure your lines are straight and level with one another.",
        "Sand any edges if you want them smoothed out.",
        "Sandpaper helps you reach small areas and makes your letters have a smooth finish.",
        "Use 80- or 100-grit sandpaper where you cut your piece with your rotary tool until the surface looks level.",
        "Then, rub the edges of your letters if you want them rounded.",
        "Some rotary tools also have a sanding bit that you can use."
