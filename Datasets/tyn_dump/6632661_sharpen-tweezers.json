However, to ensure you sharpen both sides of the tweezers evenly, make sure you choose a nail file with 2 textured sides. You can find nail files anywhere that sells beauty supplies, including drug stores and many grocery and dollar stores. Most knife sharpeners are too wide for your tweezers to fit around. Using a nail file will prevent you from having to stretch out your tweezers in order to sharpen them. Tip: If you don\u2019t have a nail file on hand, use 500- or 1000-grit sandpaper. Fold the sandpaper in half, with the textured side facing out, to make it double-sided. Then, use it the same way you would a nail file."

The motion you'll use here is very similar to sharpening a knife on a whetstone. Repeat this motion several times. Only do this lightly. If you file too much on the edge of the tweezers, you'll actually make them duller. If your tweezers still seem dull after you do this, you probably need to sharpen the grabbing surface inside the blades again. You can also do this to sharpen a flat edge on tweezers. Just hold the tweezers flat instead of at an angle. Tip: If your tweezers come to a sharp 2-sided point, rather than a single slant, carefully run the nail file along one outside edge, then the other."
