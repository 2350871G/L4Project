        "When you get up in the morning, assess the countertop to see if some or all of the oil was absorbed into the wood.",
        "If there\u2019s no excess oil on the countertop, apply another coat of oil and allow it to soak in.",
        "If there is excess oil on the countertop, wipe the excess away with a clean cloth.",
        "At this point, you won\u2019t need to apply any more oil.",
        "There\u2019s no such thing as using too much oil because the wood will stop absorbing it when it\u2019s reached its limit.",
        "Repeat the oiling process once a week for the first month.",
        "If this is a new butcher block counter, or if you sanded the entire countertop before applying the oil, add another coat of oil once a week for the first month.",
        "This will give the counters more time to absorb the oil and cure.",
        "If you attempt to do this step a couple of times and the oil refuses to soak into the wood, you can stop future weekly treatments.",
        "Maintain your counters with the oil every few months.",
        "Over time, the butcher block counters will dry out and you\u2019ll need to reapply the oil.",
        "If your counters have a lot of marks and stains, you may want to start the process over by completely sanding the countertop and reapply the oil from scratch.",
        "Alternatively, you can simply wipe a layer of oil onto a clean countertop to retore moisture.",
        "Using Wood Stain on New Counters Scrub your counters with steel wool to create a smooth surface.",
        "Use plain steel wool to lightly rub or buff your butcher block counters in the direction of the wood grain.",
        "The steel wool will make the wood feel soft and smooth.",
        "Save the steel wool as you\u2019ll need to use it again between coats of oil finish.",
        "Don\u2019t use scouring pads that contain detergent.",
        "The steel wool is being used like sandpaper for this step, not as a cleaning method.",
        "Wipe away all dust and dirt with a damp cloth.",
        "Use a damp cloth, sponge, or towel to wipe off the counters and remove any remaining dust or dirt.",
        "Wipe in the direction of the wood grain.",
        "You shouldn\u2019t need to scrub the wood, as it will be brand new and completely untreated.",
        "Rub in a pre-stain wood conditioner to the counters.",
        "Pour the pre-stain wood conditioner onto your butcher block counters, then use a clean cloth to rub it into the wood.",
        "Wood conditioner is designed to seal the wood and allow the stain to apply evenly.",
        "Don\u2019t forget to condition the edges and undersides of the counter as well.",
        "Allow the wood conditioner to soak into the wood for at least 12 hours before staining the wood.",
        "Apply 1-2 coats of wood stain with a cloth or sponge brush.",
        "Open the stain can and use a wood stick to stir the contents.",
        "Dip a cloth or sponge brush into the can and soak up the stain.",
        "You want the cloth or sponge brush to be wet, but not dripping.",
        "Sweep or slide the cloth or sponge brush across the wood in the direction of the wood grain.",
        "Do not \u2018paint\u2019 the stain onto the wood by brushing back and forth across the same area.",
        "Instead, keep your cloth or sponge brush wet enough to apply a layer of stain in one sweeping motion.",
        "Read the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for any additional requirements for the stain you purchased.",
        "Don\u2019t forget to stain the edges and undersides of the counter.",
        "Allow the wood stain to dry overnight and scrub it again with steel wool.",
        "Review the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for the exact drying time required; each type of stain may be slightly different.",
        "Once the counters are dry, lightly scrub them with steel wool to buff the wood and smooth it out again.",
        "The steel wool will even out the surface so the next coat of stain or the oil finish will soak into the wood evenly.",
        "If the wood isn\u2019t stained dark enough, apply a second coat of wood stain and repeat this step.",
        "Put a tung oil finish onto the counters and allow it to soak in.",
        "Apply one coat of tung oil finish to your counters with a clean cloth and rub it into the wood in the same direction as the wood grain.",
        "Allow the oil finish to dry overnight and then apply another coat.",
        "Keep applying coats of tung oil finish until it\u2019s puddled on top of the wood in the morning.",
        "At that point, wipe away that excess oil and allow the counters to dry completely.",
        "You can buff the wood with steel wool after each layer of oil if you want.",
        "Tung oil finish (which is not pure tung oil) can be purchased at hardware, home improvement, or paint stores.",
        "Reapply the tung oil finish every 6 months to maintain the wood.",
        "Butcher block countertops will slowly dry out over time.",
        "To keep them in their best condition, reapply the tung oil finish at least every 6 months.",
        "You can reapply the oil finish more often if the wood starts to look dull or dry.",
        "Reuse the same cloths each time you apply the oil finish.",
        "Store them in a resealable bag between uses."
