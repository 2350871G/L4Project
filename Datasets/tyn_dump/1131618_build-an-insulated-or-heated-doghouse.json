Measure your dog's height, and then add 9\u201d to determine the front of the doghouse and add 3\u201d to determine the height of the back of the doghouse. Once you have determined the size the doghouse, begin by cutting the floor joists using the 2x4's. You will need to cut two joists for the length of the doghouse and three for the width. Butt the length parts up to the width parts making a rectangle. Screw ends together using 3\u201d exterior screws. Center the third width part in the rectangle and screw to secure it. Now you have the frame of the floor of the doghouse. Cut \u00be plywood to fit over floor frame. Screw down to floor frame using 1 \u00bc exterior screws. Flip floor over to expose floor framing. Cut 1\u201d foam insulation board to fit between floor joists. Use liquid nails to secure foam insulation board. Now to build the sidewalls. Cut \u00be plywood to the width of the doghouse. Measure along the left side, using the measurement determined in step 1 for the front of the doghouse and add 3 \u00bd\u201d to allow coverage of the floor 2x4. Make a mark on the measurement.

Trace the sidewall on the \u00be\" plywood and cut to make the other sidewall. This making both sidewalls the same. Screw sidewall to the floor using 1 \u00bc \u201c exterior screws. Cut a 2x2 for each corner, the same angle as sidewall. Attach 2x2's to each corner. Cut front and back panels using the \u00be\u201d plywood. Attach only the back panels using 1 \u00bc\" exterior screws. Now cut 2x2 for the top and bottom of the front and back panels. Attach to the back only, this will give you a place to screw the interior plywood to the walls. Following the manufactures instructions for cutting hole for the dog door. Screw front panel on doghouse and install dog door. Cut 1\u201d and \u00bd \u201c foam insulation board to fit inside walls, The 1\u201d and \u00bd \u201c foam should be flush with the 2x2's on the interior. Now cut \u00be\" plywood to fit all four of the interior walls. Screw the plywood to the 2x2's using 1 \u00bc\" screws. Build the roof. Cut roof out of \u00be \u201cplywood. Be sure to leave an overhang to keep rain away from walls. You will need to cut two the same size to insulate it. Cut 2x2 for edge, this will give a place to put the foam insulation and screw the two peaces together. A piano hinge can be installed on the back and roof to make the doghouse easier to clean. Shingle the roof. Apply water-resistant felt paper and drip edge. Now, nail asphalt shingles on making sure the shingles do not line up. Drill a hole in the back of the doghouse in the corner, down near the floor. This hole needs to be just big enough for the end of the cord to the heated mat to go through.
