Screw the vacuum head onto the pole and then push 1 end of a vacuum hose onto the raised round opening for the hose. Make sure the hose is long enough that you will be able to walk around the perimeter of your pool and cover all the surface area of the bottom of the pool. A pool vacuum head is a simple vacuum head that has a hole to screw a pole or other attachment into, as well as a cylindrical opening for the hose that sticks up from the head that you push the hose onto.
