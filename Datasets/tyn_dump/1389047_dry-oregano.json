If your leaves are clean, or you purchased packaged, pre-washed oregano, you don\u2019t need to rinse them. In fact, it\u2019s better to skip washing them, since oregano retains moisture well and this will make the drying process take longer. If your stalks are dusty, have been eaten by bugs, or look kind of dirty, it\u2019s a good idea to wash them."

The leaves from 2-4 stalks should produce plenty of leaves for garnishing or flavoring your food. This method takes the longest, but it\u2019s the traditional method for drying herbs out.

Dehydrating trays are 2 plastic or metal trays that stack on one another to air food out. Dehydrating trays can be purchased from a home or kitchen goods store. Get a set with a protective screen to keep bugs and dust out of your herbs. This method takes less time than hanging your herbs, but you have to trim your leaves to do this.

Take your dehydrating trays to a room in your home that\u2019s warm and well-ventilated. Turn the fan on low if the room doesn\u2019t have a lot of air flow. Avoid placing your tray next to a window or in a well-lit room. The sun will dye your leaves and may heat some of the flavorful oils out of your oregano.

Set the trays back inside of your dehydrator. Once your dehydrator is preheated, put on an oven mitt. Open the door for your dehydrator. Carefully reinsert each tray in the dehydrator by sliding it into the grooves where the trays sit. Close the door for your dehydrator. Try to avoid disrupting your leaves or shaking the trays while you\u2019re putting them back into the dehydrator. Let your oregano dry in the dehydrator for 1-4 hours. The time it takes for your oregano to fully dry is dependent upon several factors. After your oregano has cooked for 1 hour, open the dehydrator and inspect the leaves. If they\u2019re darker, curled up a little, and crumble when you poke them with your fork, they\u2019re done. If they aren\u2019t, keep the leaves in the dehydrator for another 1-3 hours, checking them periodically to make sure you don\u2019t burn them.Warning: If you smell smoke, your oregano is probably starting to singe. Turn your dehydrator off and remove the trays with an oven mitt to let them cool. Check your oregano once every 20 minutes after 1 hour has passed. This will ensure that you don\u2019t accidentally burn your oregano. Let your oregano cool for 20 minutes before storing them in an airtight container. Heating Oregano in the Oven Preheat your oven to 170 \u00b0F (77 \u00b0C). Set a wire rack in the middle of your oven. Close the oven door. Turn the dial or press the buttons on your oven to set it to 170 \u00b0F (77 \u00b0C). Wait 5-10 minutes for your oven to preheat.Tip: If you\u2019re using this method, you don\u2019t need to blot your oregano dry with paper towels after washing it. In fact, the moisture may keep your leaves safe while they heat. This is the fastest method, but it\u2019s undoubtedly the riskiest. You can accidentally burn your oregano. You may also remove a lot of the flavors by overheating it. Still, if you\u2019re in a hurry, this is the best way to dry your oregano. Spread your oregano out on a clean, dry sheet pan. Get a clean, dry sheet pan and set it out on your counter. Take your oregano and lay it out on the uncovered sheet pan. If you\u2019re heating stalks, set each stalk parallel on the pan. If you\u2019re heating individual leaves, spread them out evenly on the sheet pan with 1 in (2.5 cm) between each leaf. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re drying the oregano on or off of the stalks. Bake your oregano for 1 hour in the center rack of your oven. Once your oven has preheated, grab your sheet pan and carefully slide it into the middle of the center rack. Close the oven door to allow your oregano to start drying out. Leave the oregano in the oven for 1 hour to let it dry. It may take a little longer than 1 hour for your oregano to dry. If you\u2019re drying leaves off of the stalk, it may take a little less time. If you leave your oregano in the oven for too long, you may heat out most of the key flavors and oils in your herb. Remove the tray and let your oregano cool for 10-20 minutes. Once your oregano has dried out, remove the tray from the oven. Set it on top of your oven to let it cool. Wait 10-20 minutes before transferring your oregano to an airtight container.",
