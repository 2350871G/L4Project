            "description": "Plastic or silver-plated metal piccolos are less expensive than wood or silver piccolos. Piccolos made of composite plastic are durable enough for marching and produce a fair quality sound. Wooden piccolos offer a more mellow timbre than metal ones. A popular compromise combines a metal head joint with a body made from wood. Two materials combined may lead to tuning inconsistencies, however, as they will react differently to changing temperatures. Keep in mind there are different keys the piccolo is tuned in. C is the most common, but many older piccolos are in Db. It is recommended you choose a C piccolo, as you can just play the flute part. Db parts aren't common, but you can find them in older pieces."
