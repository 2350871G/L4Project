If your hands are sensitive, find a pair of rubber gloves. Then clean off the dust and any debris that are on the counters with a damp sponge. If there are any stains from food products, use the Magic Erasers to help with this. If you use your counter as a cutting board (which is never recommended) the magic eraser will clean in the little cut marks on the counter to remove germs and food build up. Just look at the magic eraser when you're done, you'll see how filthy it is. (see warnings section for proper use of the magic erasers, and the \"Tips\" section for alternatives to it.) Make yourself a note, if you don't have a cutting board, to get an inexpensive one the next time you're at the store. Never cut directly on your counters! Waxing the counters makes them look new and shiny but is probably over-the-top for most people. (Mrs. Meyer's Countertop spray is easy to use and leaves them shiny and smelling nice)."
