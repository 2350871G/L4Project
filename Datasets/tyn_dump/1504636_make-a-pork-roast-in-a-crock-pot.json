For example, substitute rutabagas, beets, parsnips, and leeks. Put garlic salt and chicken broth into the slow cooker. Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 g) of garlic salt over the roast and vegetables.

Store the leftovers in an airtight container. Refrigerate them for up to 3 or 4 days. Barbecued Pork Shoulder Trim the fat from a pork shoulder. Set a 3 lb (1.4 kg) boneless pork shoulder roast on a cutting board. Then take a sharp knife and trim off any visible fat from the sides of the roast. Since pork shoulder is a well-marbled piece of meat, it will still have several veins of fat running through it. This is great for the flavor of the barbecued roast. Put a chopped onion, roast, and broth into the slow cooker. Chop 1 onion into 1 inch (2.5 cm) pieces and scatter them in the bottom of a slow cooker. Put the pork shoulder roast directly onto the chopped onion and pour \u20442 cup (120 ml) of low-sodium chicken broth or water on top. Cover and cook the roast on low for 6 to 8 hours. The meat should be tender if you insert a fork into the thickest part of the roast and you should be able to shred the meat a little if you drag the fork tines across the meat.

Then use 2 forks to pull large chunks of meat apart. Keep pulling so the meat shreds and discard any fat as you go. If it feels awkward to shred with the forks, you can use your clean hands instead. Skim off the fat from the liquid in the slow cooker. Carefully pour all of the liquid from the slow cooker into a fat separator. If you don't have a fat separator that strains the liquid, pour it through a fine mesh strainer into a measuring jug. Then pour off the fat that floats to the top of the separator or jug.VariationWhile pork shoulder is recommended because it becomes tender and flavorful, you could substitute lean pork loin. Keep in mind that leaner roasts will have a tendency to dry out, so ensure that you don't overcook them. Put the pork into the slow cooker with the remaining ingredients. Scoop the shredded pork roast back into the empty crock pot and stir in 2 cups (576 g) of barbecue sauce, 2 tablespoons (31 g) of mustard, 2 tablespoons (42 g) of honey, and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of soy sauce. If the barbecued pork looks too thick, you can stir in some of the liquid that you strained out of the slow cooker. Taste the barbecued pork and add salt or pepper according to your taste.

This also gives the flavors a chance to develop, so if you have time, you could slow cook the meat for up to 3 hours. Serve the barbecued pork. If you'd like to make sandwiches, toast hamburger buns and set them out with the barbecued pork. You can also serve barbecued beans, corn on the cob, or coleslaw with the meal. Refrigerate leftover pork in an airtight container for up to 3 or 4 days. Roast Pork Loin with Apples Cut 12 slits 3 inches (7.6 cm) deep into the pork loin. Place a 4 lb (1.8 kg) pork loin on a cutting board and use a sharp knife to make about 12 slits across the length of the loin. Make the slits deep enough to hold apple slices. This recipe works best with pork loin since pork shoulder will be too marbled to cut into easily. Rub salt, pepper, and cinnamon over the loin. Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 g) of salt, 1/4 teaspoon (0.5 g) of coarse ground pepper, and 1 teaspoon (2 g) of ground cinnamon evenly over the pork. Then use your hands to gently rub the spices into the meat.VariationUse 1/2 teaspoon (1 g) of dried sage and 1/2 teaspoon (1 g) of ground rosemary instead of the cinnamon if you'd like a more savory flavor. Slice 4 apples and insert the slices into the slits of the pork. Remove the cores from 4 granny smith apples. Cut each 1 into \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) thick slices and push 1 slice into each of the slits you cut across the pork. Keep in mind that you won't need to fit all of the apple slices into the slits. If you don't have granny smith apples, use any tart apple you have, such as Braeburn, Cortland, or McIntosh apples. Put the rest of the apple slices with onions into the slow cooker. Scatter the remaining apple slices across the bottom of a slow cooker. Then cut 2 sweet onions into \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) slices and place them in the slow cooker.

Slice the pork roast and serve it with the apples and onions. Turn off the slow cooker and carefully lift the roast out of it. Place the roast on a cutting board and cut it into slices. Transfer the slices to serving plates and spoon some of the cooked apples and onions over the meat. Refrigerate the leftover pork loin in an airtight container for up to 3 or 4 days.",
