        "Take the nose and press it onto the edge of the step.",
        "Then nail it down the same way you attached the planks.If you don\u2019t like seeing the nails in the bamboo, you can fill the holes with putty when you\u2019re done.",
        "Add horizontal planks for the stair risers.",
        "The risers are the back parts of the stairs.",
        "If you want to cover them with bamboo as well, follow the same procedure for measuring and cutting the planks to the correct size.",
        "Then hold a plank against the riser and drill holes through it.",
        "Finally, hammer finishing nails in to attach it.",
        "Repeat this process to cover each riser.If you have trouble hammering horizontally, you can alternatively attach the planks with glue instead.",
        "This is an optional step only if you want the entire staircase covered in bamboo.",
        "Some people prefer to leave the risers uncovered for a different type of decoration."
