        "Cut the bottle into 2 pieces based on how big you want your petals.",
        "You\u2019ll be using the top half of the bottle with the lid.",
        "If you want smaller petals, cut the bottle closer to the top.",
        "If you want larger petals, cut the bottle closer to the bottom.",
        "Use scissors or an X-Acto knife to carefully cut through the plastic.",
        "Recycle the bottom half of the bottle that you cut off.",
        "You won\u2019t be using it for this project.",
        "Cut 6 vertical slits around the top half of the bottle.",
        "With scissors or an X-Acto knife, make 6 cuts that run straight down from the cut edge of the bottle to the top of the bottle.",
        "Remember these are slits so leave the rim of the bottle (where you drink from) intact so the petals stay attached.",
        "For thinner petals, cut more than 6 slits.",
        "For thicker petals, cut fewer slits.",
        "Fold the 7 flaps outwards.",
        "Gently bend the flaps created by the 6 slits out to the sides.",
        "Use your fingers to lightly crease them so they stay in that position or press the bottle down on a flat surface, causing the flaps to splay out.",
        "Bend the flaps so they\u2019re at least horizontal and even turning downward at the edges.",
        "Since the candle will sit in the middle of them, if the flaps aren\u2019t folded out enough, the flame could melt the plastic.",
        "Shape the flaps into petals by trimming the edges.",
        "With scissors, round off the edges of each flap so it looks more like a flower petal.",
        "Make them curved in semi-circles or in a cool pointed shape similar to a poinsettia petal.",
        "Don\u2019t cut too much of the flap off while shaping.",
        "The more you trim, the smaller your flower will end up.",
        "Use glitter or paint to decorate the petals, then set the tea light inside.",
        "Coat the petals in a thin layer of glue or Mod Podge and sprinkle glitter all over them.",
        "Or paint pretty designs with acrylic paint.",
        "Let your decorations dry, then set a tea light in the center where the cap is.",
        "Lightweight jewels and gems look festive glued on the petals.",
        "Stay away from any decorations that are too heavy and will drag the petals down."
