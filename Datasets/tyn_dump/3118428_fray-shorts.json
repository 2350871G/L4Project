This can be particularly helpful if you are starting with pants, which tend to be cut to be more fitted in the legs. Frayed shorts generally come in a loose, hip-slung fit. If you are looking for a more form-fitting look, however, you might want to go with your normal size."

While it may be tempting to try to transform your old skinny jeans into a cool new pair of frayed shorts, you will likely end up with more of a tight, bike shorts look. Denim with a lot of stretch usually has a tighter fit, so you will likely want to avoid starting with a pair with a lot of elastic."

Worn-in denim tends to be easier to fray than stiffer and more structured newer denim. Starting with already worn-in denim will also easily give your frayed shorts that desirable cool, relaxed vibe. Most second-hand retailers carry a lot of denim in various sizes, so it is likely that you will be able to find a pair or even two at very little cost."

You will be able to use this mark as a reference as you fray your shorts to make sure that they don't end up too long or too short.

Flip the denim over and repeat on the back. Cutting your denim longer than you want the final product to be will give you a little room for error, as well as room to fray the shorts to your desired length.

If you want your shorts to be only lightly frayed in the end, you will want to trim until they are only slightly longer than your first chalk dot or small line mark, about .25 inches (0.64 cm). If you want the bottoms to be very frayed, trim until they are about .5 inches (1.3 cm) below your first chalk mark. For lightly frayed shorts, you will only need to wash the shorts a few times to get the bottoms to start to fray. As you wash and wear them, they will slowly get more frayed. As the bottoms fray, the shorts will get just a little shorter over time, which is why you want to trim close to your desired length. If you want the bottom to be more frayed, you need to leave more length to account for the additional distressing you will need to do to reach your desired look."
