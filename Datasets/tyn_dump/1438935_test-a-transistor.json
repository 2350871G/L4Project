An NPN transistor uses a positive semiconductor material (P-type) for the base and negative semiconductor material (N-type) for the collector and emitter. On a circuit diagram, an NPN transistor shows an emitter with the arrow pointing out (\"Never Points iN\" aids remembering). A PNP transistor uses an N-type material for the base and P-type material for the emitter and collector. The PNP transistor show an emitter with the arrow pointing in (\"Points In Permanently\" is the memorizer). Setting Up the Multimeter Insert the probes into the multimeter. The black probe goes into the common terminal and the red probe goes into the terminal marked for testing diodes. Turn the selector knob to the diode test function.  Replace the probe tips with alligator clamps.  Testing When You Know the Base, Emitter and Collector Determine which leads are the base, emitter and collector. The leads are round or flat wires extending from the bottom of the transistor. They may be labeled on some transistors or you may be able to determine which lead is the base by studying the circuit diagram. Clamp the black probe to the base of the transistor.  Touch the red probe to the emitter. Read the display on the multimeter and note whether the resistance is high or low. Move the red probe to the collector. The display should give the same reading as when you touched the probe to the emitter. Remove the black probe and clamp the red probe to the base.  Touch the black probe to the emitter and collector. Compare the reading on the multimeter's display to the readings you got previously. If the previous readings were both high and the current readings are both low, the transistor is good.
