Once you\u2019ve taken the awning down, lay it across a flat surface and spread it out as much as possible so you\u2019re able to see any stains or dirty spots. How you\u2019ll remove the awning from its mount will depend on the specific type and brand of your awning. Therefore, it\u2019s important that you follow the directions that came with your awning so that you can remove it properly. You may want to lay out an old sheet or tarp to protect both the awning and the surface you\u2019re cleaning on. If your canvas awning isn\u2019t removable, or you think it will be easier to clean it in its current location, you can use a ladder to reach the awning to clean it."

This will remove any surface dirt and debris, making it easier for you to spot stains on the canvas and get the awning clean. If you\u2019re using a pressure washer instead of a hose, make sure you put it on the lowest pressure setting to avoid weakening the fibers of the fabric or embedding dirt further into the canvas."

If there are any stains or bird droppings, you may need to spend a bit of extra time scrubbing these spots to get them removed. Then, flip the awning over and scrub the entire bottom. Make sure that you scrub the soap or solution into any crevices, creases, and stitching. If the canvas awning is large, you\u2019ll likely need to rub the brush across the laundry soap or dip it in the dishwashing soap solution several times to re-lather it.

To do this, mix 1 cup (240 mL) of bleach, \u20442 cup (120 mL) of dishwashing soap, and 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water together in a clean bucket and soak the awning in the solution for 15 minutes.
