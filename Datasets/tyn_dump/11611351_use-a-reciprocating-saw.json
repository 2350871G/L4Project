        "Whenever you want to stop the blade, let go of the trigger.",
        "If you\u2019re working with the saw upside-down, use your ring finger or middle finger to pull the trigger instead.Tip: Some saws have variable speed settings.",
        "If you\u2019re cutting through a soft material, like wood or drywall, use the faster setting.",
        "For hard materials, use a slow setting so you don\u2019t break the blade.",
        "Guide the blade straight through the material.",
        "Keep the shoe pressed firmly against the material you\u2019re cutting so the blade is perpendicular to it.",
        "Slowly push the blade along the line you\u2019re cutting without forcing it through the material.",
        "Let the saw do most of the work and keep the blade straight as you make your cut so you don\u2019t bend or break the blade.",
        "Once you reach the end of your cut, let go of the trigger before pulling the saw out.",
        "Try changing the angle of your blade as you cut through the material to help reduce the surface area and make the cut faster.",
        "Never pull the saw blade out of the material while holding the trigger down since the blade could catch and cause the material to kick back toward you.",
        "Make a plunge cut by pressing the blade tip through the material.",
        "Set the bottom of the saw\u2019s shoe against the material you\u2019re cutting so the blade is parallel to the surface you\u2019re cutting.",
        "Pull the trigger and tilt the saw up so the blade goes into the material at a 30- or 45-degree angle.",
        "Continue tilting the saw until it\u2019s perpendicular to the material and the blade has gone completely through to the other side.",
        "Plunge cuts work perfectly for cutting holes in walls or the middle of large panels.",
        "If you\u2019re making a plunge cut into a wall, make sure there aren\u2019t any wires or pipes behind the drywall since your saw will easily cut through them.",
        "Disconnect power and store the saw on its side.",
        "When you\u2019re finished cutting, press the button on the side of the battery pack to remove it from the saw.",
        "If you have a wired reciprocating saw, unplug the cord as soon as you\u2019re finished working.",
        "Keep the saw on its side so the blade is parallel to the ground to prevent it from bending or breaking.",
        "You can also remove the blade after each use if you want."
