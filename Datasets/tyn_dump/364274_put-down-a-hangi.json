        "Rotate people for transporting the rocks as it is a tiring process.",
        "Soak 5 sacks and 1 sheet of material in water.",
        "Do this while the rocks are being moved from the fire and into the pit.",

        "This will help to create the steam that is necessary for the hangi to cook.",
        "Mutton cloth, a table cloth, or a bed sheet are ideal types of material to use for the sheet.",
        "The size and material of the sacks doesn't matter.",
        "As long as you have enough sacks to cover the stacked food baskets, then this is all that matters.",
        "Make sure that the sheet and sacks that you use are clean.",

        "Place a wet sheet of material over the food baskets.",
        "Make sure that the sheet is wide enough to fully cover the stack of food baskets.",
        "The sheet needs to drape far enough down to cover the bottom basket almost fully, but without touching the hot rocks.",
        "Make sure that the sheet is still wet and hasn\u2019t dried before you had a chance to put it on the food baskets.",
        "Soak it again if necessary.",

        "Remove the 3 baskets of food.",
        "Two people are required for each basket, as it will be very heavy and warm.",
        "Use gloves or towels to lift the hangi basket out, and carry it away from the dirt to a table to serve.",
