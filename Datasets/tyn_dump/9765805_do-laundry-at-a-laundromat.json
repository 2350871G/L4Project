If you\u2019re carrying a lot of laundry, don\u2019t risk your back by walking to the laundromat if it\u2019s farther than 1 block away. Laundromats tend to be busier on the weekend. If you want the best chance of getting an open machine, do your laundry during the week. Some laundromats are open 24 hours a day.

Many people simply use 2 machines to wash their colors and whites at the same time. Either way, sort your laundry into 2 separate piles based on the color.

This way, you won\u2019t need to waste time separating your clothes at the laundromat. You can put a sheet of cardboard or some other kind of divider in between your colors and whites if you want to make retrieving each set of clothes from a single basket easier. If you\u2019re walking to the laundromat, a cloth laundry bag will be easier to carry than a hard-plastic or metal bin. If you\u2019re really dedicated to washing materials properly, read each tag on your items of clothing for washing instructions and sort lighter colors from your darks. Wash your jeans separately, and keep delicate fabrics together for a separate load."

There are also hash marks on the inside of the cap indicating what a full or half load is for your particular detergent. If you\u2019re using pods, put 1 pod in with each load, regardless of how many clothes you\u2019re washing. Many people prefer to use less soap.
