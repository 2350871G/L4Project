A ripe papaya will have a yellow-orange color all around and a sweet fragrance coming from the stem at the top. You should be able to press the skin in a little with your finger, but it should still be relatively firm. If your papaya is not yet ripe, you may try putting it in a brown paper bag on a room temperature kitchen shelf, next to bananas. This tends to quicken the ripening process by a day or two. If the fragrance is overpowering and/or the skin is too soft, the papaya is overripe, and you should discard it."

Place the papaya horizontally on a clean cutting board. When set, the papaya\u2019s length should be greater than its height.

With your hand safely away from the blade, hold the fruit onto your cutting board, and cut off the top and bottom of the papaya. Using a Vegetable Peeler Peel off the outer skin. Hold the papaya horizontally, with the bottom end closer to you. Hold the peeler perpendicular to the papaya.
