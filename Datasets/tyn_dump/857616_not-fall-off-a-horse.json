Some people try to run their horses into fences to stop them. DON'T do that! Your horse is likely to slam on the breaks (sending you flying over his neck) or swerve (sending you over the edge). By leaning back you slow your horse gradually until he's under control. Don't turn him in too tight circles so he doesn't trip. If this doesn't work, you can half halt, or pull your hands back to your waist(not up), and slowly say in a deep tone, 'Whoa'. This can get them into a slower gait and or stop them completely in a timely manner."

Don't scream or panic. 'Whoa' or 'Shh' in a very soothing voice. It will calm you AND your horse. If there is a potentially scary object ahead, start to turn your horse away from it and start heading in another direction. Make them concentrate on you and the reigns opposed to the scary thing and your horse will eventually calm down."

DO NOT search for your stirrup while going at a fast gait, this will only  handicap your ability to squeeze with your legs to hold on. If they buck. Disengage their hindquarters, this is done by sharply pulling the reins to the left or the right and having its nose to your leg. This only allows them to move in a tight circle. You can also scrunch the reins, doing so by gathering the reins in one hand, and using the other to move along the reins, creating a tight 'scrunch' around the horses neck, this triggers a vertebrae in the horses neck, making them unable to buck."

If he does rear, DO NOT pull the reigns; that could potentially make the horse topple over and land with all weight on you. Put all your weight forward and the most accurate result is no fall."
