                    "description": "Don\u2019t mistake bay leaves for your run-of-the-mill fallen leaf. While a more unconventional seasoning method, bay leaves are a subtle but effective way to add a soft, mint-esque flavor to your food. Some people also think that bay leaves give off a pine-like flavor. These are best used when seasoning soups or stews, since they have to be removed before the lentil dish is served. Add 1 bay leaf per 2 cups (400 g) of dry lentils."

                    "description": "Add an earthier element to your lentils by sprinkling some fresh or dried rosemary over them. Rosemary is especially potent when making lentil stews and soups, since the flavor gets stronger when the rosemary is left to simmer for longer. If you don\u2019t want to use it as a seasoning ingredient, consider using rosemary as a garnish for your lentils. Don\u2019t overdo it with rosemary. Even if you love the flavor in your lentils, start with a small amount before adding in anymore. Add 2 tsp (1.12 g) of freshly chopped rosemary for every 1 cup (200 g) of lentils you include."

Although viewed as one herb, oregano actually has 2 popular strains: Mexican and Mediterranean. For lentils, opt for the Mexican variety, as it sports a sharper, lemony taste. Mediterranean oregano tastes different depending on the exact place it originates from. For example, Italian oregano doesn\u2019t pack as much of a punch as Turkish oregano. Use 1 tsp (1 g) of dried oregano for every 2 cups (400 g) of lentils you include in the recipe."

When you go to the grocery store, keep in mind that coriander is sold in both seed and powder form. Before turning it into a powder, roast coriander while it\u2019s still in seed form. This adds more flavor and to the spice when you add it to your lentils. Aside from cumin, coriander is often paired with turmeric powder, as well.
