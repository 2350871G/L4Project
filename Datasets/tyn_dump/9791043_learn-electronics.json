        "Without a resistor, the electrical current can become too strong and ruin other components.",
        "For example, if you attach an LED light to a circuit without a resistor, the light can burn out.",
        "Store electricity with a capacitor.",
        "Capacitors are the opposite of resistors.",
        "Instead of limiting the flow, they encourage it by storing a little bit of electricity.",

        "You can light the bulb with only these components.",
        "The electrical current flows from the negative terminal to the positive one, passing through the light bulb along the way.",
