For example, 8.5 in \u00d7 11 in (22 cm \u00d7 28 cm) paper will make small boxes that are more suitable for children. If you want larger boxes, try printing on 9 in \u00d7 12 in (23 cm \u00d7 30 cm) sheets or even 11 in \u00d7 14 in (28 cm \u00d7 36 cm). Before hitting print, make sure that your printer can handle the paper size and weight of the cardstock. Select the correct print settings under preferences. Cardstock will be somewhere between 50-110 lb. For a unique touch, you could print the design on a different color of cardstock, such as light blue or pink."
