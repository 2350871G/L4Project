                    "description": "Unfortunately rubbing sandpaper against the wall won't work very well. Instead you will need to invest in a sanding block or a sander. A sanding block is a small block of material that you can wrap sandpaper around, making it easier to sand flat surfaces. A sander is a automated tool like a drill that you load sandpaper into and it sands the surface for you. To use a sanding block, wrap the sandpaper around one side of the block and grip it with your hand from the other side. Sanders can differ in how you load them with the sandpaper, but generally they have a slot that you can load the sandpaper into before turning it on. If you haven't used a sander before, a sanding block is a safer option. A coarser grit on the sandpaper is acceptable because you're aiming to strip the unwanted paint. Use 80-grit sandpaper if you're looking to remove globs of paint. Sanding a wall will cause a risk of inhaling toxic dust, so wear a mask before beginning."
