Slice in a downward motion towards the cutting board. Remember to try and remove as little of the skin as possible.

Hold the handle of the fork with your non-dominant hand so it does not move. Use a fork with smaller tines for smaller pieces of ginger. Rub peeled ginger across the tines of the fork. Hold the ginger with your dominant hand. Keep constant and even pressure on the ginger as you drag it across the edge of the fork. You\u2019ll see strands of minced ginger falling from the knob you are grating. Pull the ginger in all directions.
