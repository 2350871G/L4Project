Transferring them into their own tank keeps them safe. As the eggs are hatching, you may notice tiny, \u20448 in (3.2 mm) transparent fry in the cave. Raising Peacock Gudgeon Fry Feed the fry 1 tsp (3-4 g) of microworms after 2-4 days. Either purchase microworms from a pet supply store or culture your own. Wait until all of the eggs have hatched and the fry begin swimming. Then drop the microworms directly into the water. After 2-4 days, the fry are big enough to eat food larger than infusoria. Give the fry 10-15 newly hatched brine shrimp twice per day from 1 week old. As the fry get bigger, they can move onto larger live foods.
