Turn on the faucet and place the apple underneath, using your fingers to scrub the apple gently to remove any surface dirt. Once the apple is clean, dry it off with a paper towel or clean cloth. Remove any produce stickers from the apple as well. Peel the apples using a vegetable peeler. Be careful when using the peeler and go slowly, starting at the stem and working your way around the apple in a circle. Remove all of the skin so that the apple is ready to be sliced. Repeat this process for however many apples you\u2019re using. If you don\u2019t have a vegetable peeler, you can use a paring knife. Remove the core with a sharp cutting knife.

Preserving the Apples Preserve the apples as soon as you peel and slice them. This prevents the apples from browning too quickly. Choose which way you want to preserve the apples, whether it's using lemon juice, soaking them in salt water, or using a fruit preserver. Use lemon juice to keep the apple slices from browning. Combine 4 cups (950 ml) of water with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of lemon juice in a bowl, stirring it thoroughly with a spoon. Put the apple slices in the bowl and let them sit in the lemon juice and water for 5 minutes. Make sure all of the slices are submerged in the lemon juice mixture at some point. Soaking the apples in the lemon juice and water mixture shouldn't alter the taste very much. The ascorbic acid is what helps the lemon juice prevent browning.

These most often come in a powder form, so apply the fruit preserver in an even coat making sure to cover both sides of every slice. Fruit preservers should not alter the taste of the apples. Freezing the Apple Slices Drain the apple slices in a colander if you soaked them. If the apple slices were put in a liquid to sit for a few minutes, pour the bowl of apples into a colander to drain out the liquid. Shake the colander lightly to ensure all of the liquid gets strained.
