        "Divide 50 feet (15 m) by the number of seconds it took to find the velocity.",
        "For example, if it takes 12 seconds for the wood chip to travel 50 feet (15 m), the velocity of the water is 4.16 feet (1.27 m) per second.",
        "For water that moves 2 to 4 feet (0.61 to 1.22 m) per second, use rocks 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 cm) wide.",
        "For water that moves 4 to 6 feet (1.2 to 1.8 m) per second, use rocks 4 to 12 inches (10 to 30 cm) wide.",
        "For water that moves 6 to 12 feet (1.8 to 3.7 m) per second, use rocks 5 to 18 inches (13 to 46 cm) wide.",
        "Use granite or limestone.",
        "Pick angular and blocky shaped rocks since they leave less open space than if you use round rocks.",
        "Granite and limestone are commonly used since they are resilient and can withstand cycles of freezing and thawing.",
        "Broken concrete can also be used as long as it varies in size and no longer has steel rebar.",
        "Purchase the rocks from a landscaping store and ask them how many you may need for the area.",
        "Slope the river bank so it is twice as long as it is wide.",
        "Hire a professional or rent a mini-bulldozer to scrape away layers of soil.",
        "Your riprap wall should be tall enough so that it can handle the river at its highest point.",
        "Imagine a right triangle where the sloped side is the riprap.",
        "The bottom should be 2 times longer than the height.",
        "For example, if you need to build your riprap 6 feet (1.8 m) high, it should extend a total of 12 feet (3.7 m).",
        "Your total slope length, then, would be approximately 13.5 feet (4.1 m).",
        "The slope should extend down to the top of the river bank for the most erosion protection.",
        "Lay geotextile fabric on the slope to stabilize the soil.",
        "A roll of fabric like coir or jute can be purchased online or at specialty stores.",
        "Lay it over the entire slope.",
        "Secure the netting down with U-shaped pins every 30 centimetres (12 in).",
        "For added protection, you can also layer 6 inches (15 cm) of gravel on top of the fabric.",
        "Layer the rocks so the riprap is 12 to 18 inches (0.30 to 0.46 m) thick.",
        "Place the largest rocks as the bottom layer.",
        "Fill in the areas between them with smaller stones.",
        "Make the rocks fit together as close as possible so water cannot move around or through them.",
        "Use a variety of stone sizes to fill in the space as much as possible."
