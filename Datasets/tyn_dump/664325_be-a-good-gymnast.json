If you are more advanced, you may be able to join a competitive gymnastics team. Be on time. Arrange a good schedule, and make sure you leave a good amount of time to get to your class. Work hard. Not just vault, floor, beam, bars. Also, work hard in the conditioning and stretching. But don't go too far, especially with the stretching. Ask your coach or instructor for tips.

Think that you can do a skill, that you are afraid to. Try to be positive at every single practice! Set goals for yourself to reach. Maybe it's something like getting better at double backs, or something like getting your leg higher in a scorpion. What ever it is, if you have a goal in mind, it makes it easier to achieve it.
