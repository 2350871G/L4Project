The ball at one end of the diamond is on top of the marked \"foot spot\" on the table surface. The nine ball is in the center of the diamond, and the other balls are arranged randomly around it. Break by shooting the cue ball at the rack. The player about to break places the cue ball behind the \"head string,\" on the far side of the table from the diamond-shaped rack of balls.

        "Consider it good practice for pocketing a ball on the break, and decide whether to continue using it once you are more experienced.",
        "Practice getting one of the side balls into the corner pockets.",
        "The two balls on the shorter tips of the diamond, or \"wing balls,\" can sometimes be hit into the corner pockets, although don't expect to get both at once!",
        "This technique will likely require a fair amount of practice.",
        "Begin by placing the cue ball near the left side cushion, and aim at the center of the one ball.",
        "Watch the wing ball near the left cushion and see where it ends up.",
        "If it drifts toward the end cushion, set up the rack again and aim slightly more to the right.",
        "If the wing ball hits the left side cushion instead, aim to the left next time.",
        "Once you've found a spot that consistently gets the wing ball near or in the corner pocket, practice the shot repeatedly to make it more consistent.",
        "Think about where the cue ball and one ball will end up.",
        "Once you can consistently hit the spot you are aiming for, and rarely scratch or foul on the break, start thinking about positioning after the break.",
        "With enough control, and potentially by adding spin to the cue ball, you can get the cue ball to end up near the center line of the table, giving yourself a better chance at a good second shot if you manage to pocket a ball on the break.",
        "If you are not trying to get the one ball in, watch where it ends up as well, since it is the next ball you will have to pocket.",
        "Ideally, the one ball ends up near the center of the table, in line with the cue ball.",
        "Find a new table's sweet spot.",
        "Each table has slightly different characteristics, and if you move to a new one, you might find your breaks are not as effective.",
        "Move the cue ball around until you find a location that gets good results for your preferred strength and style of break.",
        "Try to find a worn-out spot on the table's surface where many players have placed a cue ball before.",
        "This is not ideal, as you may have a different break style than those players, but it's worth a try if you don't have more time to spend exploring different positions."
