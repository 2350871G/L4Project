Other dancers prefer to sew the elastic about a thumb's width from the back seam. Be aware that sewing the elastic to the heels may give you blisters. Measure your shoe and foot for the elastic strap. Put your shoe on. Wrap a measuring tape over the top of your foot, from 1 side of the shoe to the other.
