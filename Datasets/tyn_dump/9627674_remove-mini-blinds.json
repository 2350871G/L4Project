Drawing the blinds up will prevent you from accidentally damaging them. Stand on a ladder to reach the top of the blinds if necessary. Some home blinds may be within reach, but for others, you may need a ladder. Ask another person to hold the ladder steady as you climb it. Snap off the cover or valence if you have one. Some blinds may have a bar, valence, or box over the headrail at the top. This cover hides the brackets from view. To remove it, look on the bottom for 2 buttons or clips. Press down on the clips with your fingers and snap the cover forward and off. You should now see the headrail and brackets. Look for raised cubes at each end of the headrail. You should have 1 bracket on each end of the blinds. Brackets look like cubes. They should protrude slightly from the main support bar. If your blinds are very long, you may have additional brackets along the center of the headrail. Identify if you have hinged brackets or sliding brackets. Hinged brackets typically have a panel on the front that snaps to the bottom of the bracket. You may see a raised lip with an opening on the bottom.
