        "Jeff Huynh\t\t\tGeneral Manager, Handyman Rescue Team\t\t\t\tExpert Trick: Give the furniture a light sanding between coats.",
        "This roughs up the surface just a little, which helps the paint to adhere better and keeps you from having to apply lots and lots of coats of paint.",
        "Wait 2-3 hours for the spray paint to dry completely.",
        "After applying the first coat, let the paint dry.",
        "Check the directions on the canister to see how long you should wait in between coats for the specific brand.",
        "If there isn\u2019t a time listed, 2 hours is normally enough time for the paint to dry to the touch.",
        "If you\u2019re also painting drawers, you can use this time to apply the first coat of paint to them.",
        "If you\u2019re unsure of whether the paint has dried, put on a pair of gloves and touch an inconspicuous area, like the back of the item.",
        "If it\u2019s dry, none of the paint will stick to your finger.",
        "If there are drips in the paint once it\u2019s dry, gently sand them by hand with 220-grit sandpaper to make the area smooth.",
        "Be sure to wipe down the area with a tack cloth before proceeding.",
        "Use spray polycrylic sealant between coats if the furniture will be used often.",
        "For items like a coffee table or chair, it\u2019s important to seal the paint to prevent knicks and scratches.",
        "Purchase a spray sealant and apply it evenly like you would a regular coat of paint.",
        "Wait 2 hours for the sealant to dry before adding another coat of paint on top of it.",
        "If the furniture is going to be used less often, such as a decorative table or a bookshelf, you don\u2019t have to use a sealant.",
        "You can safely use sealant with a textured or specialty finish since it\u2019s applied in between coats and the finish will still appear on the topcoat.",
        "Add a second layer of spray paint to the furniture for more coverage.",
        "Shake the canister of paint for 1 minute and then apply another even coat using up and down and side to side motions.",
        "Be sure to cover hard-to-reach places, such as ledges and corners.",
        "Focus on getting more coverage on areas that were sparse on the first coat.",
        "It\u2019s easy to forget to paint the underside of a chair or other piece of furniture, so carefully tip the piece of furniture on its side to make sure there aren\u2019t any bare surfaces!",
        "If you applied a sealant in between the coats of paint, you don\u2019t need to add another after your second coat has dried.",
        "Let the paint cure for 24 hours before reattaching any hardware.",
        "Store the painted furniture overnight in a well-ventilated room so the paint can cure.",
        "After a day, carefully reattach any hardware, insert drawers, and inspect the furniture to make sure there are no chips in the paint.",
        "If you reattach the hardware or move the furniture before the paint cures, it may crack or chip more easily.",
        "If the paint does chip, you may be able to fix the blemish.",
        "Spray some of the spray paint onto a paper plate, and use a paintbrush to apply a coat of paint to the blemish.",
        "Let it dry for 2-3 hours before applying a second coat to blend the paint."
