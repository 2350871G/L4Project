Autoclaves or bead sterilizers are special machines that are intended specifically for this purpose. Each sterilizer will be different, so you should follow the setup directions for your sterilizer for best results. You could also use your oven to sterilize your clippers. To do this, lay your clippers on an oven-safe pan and bake your clippers at precisely 170\u00b0C (340\u00b0F) for 60 minutes. If you use your oven to sterilize your clippers, you should remove them with caution, as they'll be hot after being sterilized. Plastic nail clippers, or any clippers you worry might not hold up to extreme heat, should be sanitized with another method."

This will remove any loose bits of gunk or buildup from your clippers. Pay extra attention to ridges and contours on your clippers. Gunk and buildup love to hide in these places. After you finish wiping your clippers, you should wash or throw away your rag or paper towel to prevent the potential spread of bacteria or micro-organisms. A little bit of water or some cleaning agent on your cloth can add more cleaning power to your wipe down. If you get your clippers wet while wiping, be sure they are completely dry before sterilizing, especially with a bead sterilizer. The beads in bead sterilizers can become stuck to your clippers if you attempt to sterilize them while wet."

Heat conducts easily through metal, so you may want to use gloves or an oven mitt whenever handling tools that are freshly heat sterilized. When using a bead sterilizer, glass beads can sometimes stick to your clippers. Be careful, these will be extremely hot."
