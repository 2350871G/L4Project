A modern computer built or purchased within the past three years should be sufficient. If possible, acquire a working high-quality soundcard, such as an M-Audio Fast Track Pro or Digidesign Mbox 2 Mini. Creative Labs does have a Pro Music line called EMU. A 1212M PCI system is ideal if you were going to go that route. Monitor speakers are helpful if you are looking to stick with this for more than a hobby. The M-Audio Studiophile BX8a's, KRK RP-8 Rokit work well, and if you've got money to burn, the Mackie HR824 Studio Monitors. If you're into hip-hop, techno, or dance music, a set of turntables will be needed to record your sets or scratches on the fly. You can also use DJ software such as Traktor or Serato and a USB DJ controller to try out your mixes. A midi keyboard will be useful if you want to use midi software (which you can use to write bass lines, piano parts, and drum beats). Nothing fancy is needed, but each person will have their own preference. There are many advantages to having a midi keyboard because it will give you the tactile feel of a real instrument, which can greatly aid creativity."
