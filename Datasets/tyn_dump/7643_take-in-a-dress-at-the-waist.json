Then, pinch both sides of your waist at the narrowest part until the waist is as tight as you like. Hold a ruler across the fabric you're pinching in order to see out how much fabric to take in. To keep the waist even, you'll need to take in the same amount of fabric from each side seam. For example, you might want to take in a dress by \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) on each side so it fits better."

Size charts that pair waist measurements with sizes can vary wildly. Cut a strip of fabric that's 1 inch (2.5 cm) longer than the circumference. Lay about 2 to 4 feet (0.61 to 1.22 m) of fabric that matches your dress on a work surface. Then, cut the fabric to a 1 \u20444 in (4.4 cm) wide strip that's 1 inch (2.5 cm) longer than the measurement for the waistline circumference. For example, if your waistline measured 38 inches (97 cm), cut the strip 39 inches (99 cm) long and 1 \u20444 in (4.4 cm) wide. Fold the strip lengthwise and sew \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) along the edge. Fold the fabric in half lengthwise so the right sides are facing together.

        "Edge stitch the bottom and top of the casing to the waistline.",
        "You can use your regular presser foot to edge stitch \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) from the top and bottom edges of the casing.",
        "Stitch around the waistline, but stop about 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the end so you can feed the elastic through the casing.",
        "If your machine has one, use an edge joining foot.",
        "This foot will act as a guide as you edge stitch along the casing.",
        "Cut a piece of elastic 1 inch (2.5 cm) longer than the waistline.",
        "Get out a \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) wide piece of elastic and unroll it so it's as long as your waistline measurement.",
        "Add 1 inch (2.5 cm) to the measurement and cut the elastic.",
        "Secure a safety pin to the elastic and pull it through the casing.",
        "The safety pin will make it easier to pull the elastic through the casing.",
        "Keep pulling the pin until the elastic is completely through the casing.",
        "To prevent the elastic from slipping back into the casing, you can pin the ends to the fabric outside the casing.",
        "At this point you can try on the dress right side out to see if you're happy with the waistline.",
        "Zigzag stitch the ends of the elastic together and sew the casing shut.",
        "Once you've taken the safety pin out, overlap the ends by 1 inch (2.5 cm).",
        "Then, zigzag stitch the ends together and use a straight stitch to sew the casing closed.",
        "You can now turn the dress right side out and enjoy the tighter waist!"
