                    "description": "Bend the back of the shoe inwards to make the heel area more spacious, then push the toe to and away from the laces. You can also bend the leather in and out on the instep (or the middle, by the laces) of the shoe. This may cause creasing in the leather. To avoid noticeable or permanent creases, be sure your leather is properly conditioned before you use your hands to stretch it. Dr. Martens has its own product, Wonder Balsam, for this purpose. Periodically conditioning your boots will also aid in the overall break-in process. Soft and supple leather is much easier to stretch than stiff leather.
