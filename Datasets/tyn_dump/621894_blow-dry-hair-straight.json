This will result in a smoother blowout than one done without a nozzle. Most hair dryers come with a nozzle attachment, but if yours didn't, you can purchase one separately from a beauty supply store. In addition to a hair dryer, you'll need the following:\nWide-toothed comb\nLarge round, boar-bristle brush\nHeat protectant product\nHair oil or anti-frizz serum"
