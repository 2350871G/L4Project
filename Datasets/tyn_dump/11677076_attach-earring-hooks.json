Next, pinch the loose, disconnected end of the wire with a pair of round- or needle-nosed pliers. Pull upwards or outwards on the end of the loop to create a wide gap, which you can use to string on beads or other jewelry attachments. French earring hooks have a gentle curve, and are commonly used in a variety of handmade jewelry. Some varieties of this hook have a wire coil attached to the base. You can use this open loop to attach other earring decorations, like feathers or dangling leather shapes. You can use the same process to open the small metal loops attached to lever-back French clips and earring posts. As the name suggests, lever-back hooks use a clasping mechanism to secure the earring, while posts use a straight strand, or \u201cpost,\u201d of metal."

Pull, twist, or unfasten the loose end of wire to open the earring hook, which allows you to string beads and other trinkets onto the hoop. Note that, unlike other earrings, hoops double as both the hook and the earring itself. Manipulating hoops have a flattened metal end with a hole drilled in the center where the loose section of wire threads through. To connect and disconnect the hoop, slide the loose section of wire through the drilled hole. Leverback hoops use a clasp mechanism, which can be opened and closed to secure the earring. Crimp hoops use a special clip to hold the hoop together. To secure the earring into place, pull down the lever that\u2019s attached to the crimp. Endless hoops are made with a curved, hollow loop that accepts and secures a thin, small section of wire. Stick the thin portion of wire into the hollow loop to secure the jewelry, then pull on the wire to open the hoop. Sleeper hoops come with a twisting mechanism that locks the loose section of wire into place."
