    "text": " Buying Upholstery Supplies Choose a well-used easy chair for your first project. Many crafters suggest trying your hand at upholstery on a thrift store find, rather than your favorite chair. It will allow you to experiment more comfortably. Find upholstery fabric. This is usually a more durable than normal cotton or flannel cloth. It will hold up to wear and tear. Purchase enough fabric to cover your chair. A small easy chair will need four yards (3.7m) of fabric, while a large chair will need over seven and a half (6.9m) yards of fabric. Buy one half-inch (1.3cm) thick bonded polyester batting if the structure of the chair needs to be improved. You may also need sheets of thick foam core for the seat. Find a staple gun and three-eighths inch staples. These are the main way you will secure the fabric, foam and batting. Also, purchase upholstery thread, needles and tacks for a more professional look. Deconstructing the Chair Take plenty of pictures of the easy chair. Take them from all-angles so that you can refer to them if you lose or mislabel a piece of cloth. Consider drawing a diagram and labeling the diagram as well as the pieces of cloth. Turn the chair over. Remove the legs using a screwdriver. Remove the fabric piece by piece. Use a seam ripper along the edge of the bottom, the sides and the back. Then, remove staples and tacks with pliers. Loosen stubborn areas with a box cutter. Note the order in which you took off the fabric. You can mimic the layering method used by the original furniture makers. Set aside the pieces one by one as you take them off. Label them with a piece of masking tape and a pen. Be as specific as possible. Remove cardboard pieces, if they come loose. Set them by the piece of fabric they are connected to. Later, you can cut new piece of cardboard or reuse the existing pieces. Make notes as to what places on the couch require foam core, batting and tack strips. Cutting Fabric Lay your yards of fabric on the floor upside down. Set the pieces of old fabric atop it. Try to position them as close together as possible to avoid wasting fabric. Draw around the old pieces with chalk. Cut out the pieces one by one with fabric scissors. Label them immediately with the tape you used to label the original pieces. Repeat this template process with batting, cardboard and foam core.  Reserve your strips of piping from the original chair. Measure them. Purchase plastic cord to use as a piping base. Make new piping with the leftover fabric. Cut strips that are one inch (2.5cm) wide and as long as the original piping. Wrap the cord vertically in the middle of the fabric. Pin it in place. Run your sewing machine needle as close as possible to the fabric near the cord, without going over it. You will capture the cord inside the fabric. If you don\u2019t have a sewing machine, hand sew as close to the piping as possible. Reupholstering an Easy Chair Start reattaching your fabric to the frame in the opposite order that you used to take it apart.  Use staples to reattach the fabric around the bottom and back. However, use tack strips where they were originally used. They help to stretch the fabric so that it won\u2019t come loose. Sew the arms and piping by hand, using upholstery thread and a needle. Refer to the picture of your chair so that you can see how excess fabric on the arms is folded and attached. Add the piping between layers of fabric. For example, start by covering the length of the arms with fabric and staples. Then, run the piping along the entire front edge of the arm. Follow by covering the arms with foam, batting and fabric. If you are having problems creating a square edge, lay down cardboard tacking strips underneath the fabric, right behind the piping. Then, fold the fabric up and around the arm. Pull the fabric through the chair if it is a recliner. You will need to reach the fabric underneath and secure it with staples. Test it several times before continuing to ensure it doesn\u2019t catch. Wrap the back piece of fabric around tack strip until it is taught. Then, hammer the tack strip onto the back frame of your easy chair. Sew on additional skirting and fortify any loose areas with upholstery thread and needle. You\u2019ve officially got yourself a newly-upholstered easy chair!",
