Perlite is a volcanic mineral that helps improve drainage and insulates plant roots when there are changes in the temperature. Vermiculite contains minerals that help the soil retain moisture and nutrients. It can also help improve drainage. Coir is coconut fiber, and serves as a light, well-draining growth medium for seeds.
