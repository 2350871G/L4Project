                    "description": "If you tend to feel more self-conscious about a particular part of your body, try selecting pieces that have more neutral colors and patterns. While patterned and bright-colored clothing pieces can be fun to wear, they also tend to draw attention to that part of your body. Going with clean, simple pieces for the heavier parts of your body will keep the focus on the places you want to accentuate. If you\u2019re a man and you tend to carry weight in your upper body, for example, for work attire, try a solid-colored jacket with a lightly striped shirt. The stripes on the shirt will add a bit of visual interest while the solid jacket will help slim out your frame. For example, if you\u2019re a woman and you\u2019re top-heavy, you could try a fitted v-neck sweater in a subtle, neutral color paired with a dark pencil skirt or patterned high-waisted skirt. This will keep the attention away from your top and focused on your waistline. While neutral pieces will draw the eye elsewhere, if you feel cute in a patterned piece, go for it! The most important thing is that you feel good in whatever you decide to wear."

                    "description": "When shopping for pieces that\u2019ll make you look and feel cute, focus on finding shirts, dresses, tops, and skirts that cinch in at your natural waistline. Regardless of your body type, cinching at your waist will help define and flatter your figure. For example, if you\u2019re a woman, go for a fit and flare dress with a fitted top and an A-line bottom that cinches at the waist. The fitted top will streamline your body while the volume of the A-line bottom will accentuate your cinched-in natural waistline. If you\u2019re a man, take the time to find button-downs and jackets that cinch in at your waist a bit to help define your waistline. If you have a hard time finding items that fit well in your upper body, taking items you already own to a tailor is a great option."

                    "description": "Unlike lighter wash, thinner fabric jeans, which can bring attention to all the curves on your lower half, good quality, thicker, dark wash jeans help elongate your legs and slim out your lower half. While having a bit of stretch is important to ensure that you can move and be comfortable, good quality, thicker denim fabric can help smooth out or disguise any bulges or bumps you\u2019re hoping to conceal. In addition, whether you\u2019re a man or a woman, try to keep any rips or embellishments to a minimum. While these can give your denim a cool, funky vibe, they will also draw the eye down to your legs and midsection."

Instead, look for tops with a v-neck to draw the eyes vertically up and down rather than horizontally, which could emphasize the width of your chest. With a v-neck, whether you\u2019re a man or a woman, you\u2019ll create a longer, leaner vertical silhouette. V-neck tops also provide a bit of visual interest to your upper body, which can help draw attention away from areas you\u2019re hoping to conceal. If you\u2019re a woman, straight necklines may push your chest together into that undesirable uniboob look."

The high-waisted fit covers up any extra tummy weight, helping you feel cute and confident. When choosing a pencil skirt, however, make sure that it\u2019s not too tight, as this can cause some unwanted bulging or puckering. Pair a pencil skirt with a simple button-down for work, or try a loose crop top for a night out with friends. As a general rule of thumb, if you can see the line of your undergarments, the skirt is likely too tight."

Unlike options with a skinny waistband, pants with a wide waistband won\u2019t dig into your sides or your belly, which can be both unflattering and very uncomfortable. For the most flattering fit, look for pants with a wide waistband that sits either right at your belly button to cover your belly, or higher to accentuate your natural waist line. Many wide waistband pants also come with a wide belt, which can give you an extra layer to shape and conceal any extra weight."

In contrast to more structured shorts, such as denim shorts, shorts made of a flowy fabric with a looser fit will prevent them from being too tight on your legs. As a result, they\u2019ll make your legs look longer and leaner. If you\u2019re a woman, pair your higher-waisted shorts with a tank top that flares out a bit for a loose yet streamlined fit. If you\u2019re a man, try wearing your shorts with a stylish, lightweight short-sleeve button-down in a fitted style. The lightweight fabric will keep you from sweating while the fitted style will keep your outfit from looking too baggy. Flowy style shorts often come with an elastic waist, making them more comfortable to wear and preventing them from digging in to your sides and tummy."

        "For example, if you\u2019re a woman and you\u2019re top-heavy, you could try a fitted v-neck sweater in a subtle, neutral color paired with a dark pencil skirt or patterned high-waisted skirt.",
        "This will keep the attention away from your top and focused on your waistline.",
        "While neutral pieces will draw the eye elsewhere, if you feel cute in a patterned piece, go for it!",
        "The most important thing is that you feel good in whatever you decide to wear.",
        "Go for pieces that are fitted along your natural waist.",
        "When shopping for pieces that\u2019ll make you look and feel cute, focus on finding shirts, dresses, tops, and skirts that cinch in at your natural waistline.",
        "Regardless of your body type, cinching at your waist will help define and flatter your figure.",
        "For example, if you\u2019re a woman, go for a fit and flare dress with a fitted top and an A-line bottom that cinches at the waist.",
        "The fitted top will streamline your body while the volume of the A-line bottom will accentuate your cinched-in natural waistline.",
        "If you\u2019re a man, take the time to find button-downs and jackets that cinch in at your waist a bit to help define your waistline.",
        "If you have a hard time finding items that fit well in your upper body, taking items you already own to a tailor is a great option.",
        "Choose good quality dark wash jeans with a bit of stretch.",
        "Unlike lighter wash, thinner fabric jeans, which can bring attention to all the curves on your lower half, good quality, thicker, dark wash jeans help elongate your legs and slim out your lower half.",
        "While having a bit of stretch is important to ensure that you can move and be comfortable, good quality, thicker denim fabric can help smooth out or disguise any bulges or bumps you\u2019re hoping to conceal.",
        "In addition, whether you\u2019re a man or a woman, try to keep any rips or embellishments to a minimum.",
        "While these can give your denim a cool, funky vibe, they will also draw the eye down to your legs and midsection.",
        "Look for tops with a v-neck to slim out your chest area.",
        "If you have a large or wide chest area, you\u2019ll likely want to avoid tops with a straight-across neckline.",
        "Instead, look for tops with a v-neck to draw the eyes vertically up and down rather than horizontally, which could emphasize the width of your chest.",
        "With a v-neck, whether you\u2019re a man or a woman, you\u2019ll create a longer, leaner vertical silhouette.",
        "V-neck tops also provide a bit of visual interest to your upper body, which can help draw attention away from areas you\u2019re hoping to conceal.",
        "If you\u2019re a woman, straight necklines may push your chest together into that undesirable uniboob look.",
        "Wear a high-waisted pencil skirt to elongate your whole body.",
        "If you\u2019re a woman, pencil skirts are a great option for a versatile piece that will both show off your curves while making your body look long and lean.",
        "The high-waisted fit covers up any extra tummy weight, helping you feel cute and confident.",
        "When choosing a pencil skirt, however, make sure that it\u2019s not too tight, as this can cause some unwanted bulging or puckering.",
        "Pair a pencil skirt with a simple button-down for work, or try a loose crop top for a night out with friends.",
        "As a general rule of thumb, if you can see the line of your undergarments, the skirt is likely too tight.",
        "Select pants with a wide waistband to slim out your midsection.",
        "When shopping for pants or trousers, focus on options with a waistband that is about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) thick.",
        "Unlike options with a skinny waistband, pants with a wide waistband won\u2019t dig into your sides or your belly, which can be both unflattering and very uncomfortable.",
        "For the most flattering fit, look for pants with a wide waistband that sits either right at your belly button to cover your belly, or higher to accentuate your natural waist line.",
        "Many wide waistband pants also come with a wide belt, which can give you an extra layer to shape and conceal any extra weight.",
        "Try a jumpsuit with an adjustable waistband for a flattering trendy look.",
        "Whether you\u2019re looking for a comfy outfit to wear to run errands or a trendy look for dinner with friends, if you\u2019re a woman, a jumpsuit with an adjustable waistband is a great option.",
        "The adjustable waistband will allow you to decide how loosely or tightly you want to cinch your waist in, while the fuller coverage of the jumpsuit allows you to cover aspects of your body that you\u2019re insecure about.",
        "Look for options in thicker fabrics with a bit of stretch, such as a spandex/cotton blend, so you\u2019ll feel both cute and comfortable.",
        "Try a jumpsuit with long or \u00be length sleeves if you feel insecure about your arms.",
        "Go for a pair of high-waisted, looser shorts for a summer-ready option.",
        "Higher-waisted shorts help smooth out your midsection, keeping any bulges or love handles tucked in.",
        "In contrast to more structured shorts, such as denim shorts, shorts made of a flowy fabric with a looser fit will prevent them from being too tight on your legs.",
        "As a result, they\u2019ll make your legs look longer and leaner.",
        "If you\u2019re a woman, pair your higher-waisted shorts with a tank top that flares out a bit for a loose yet streamlined fit.",
        "If you\u2019re a man, try wearing your shorts with a stylish, lightweight short-sleeve button-down in a fitted style.",
        "The lightweight fabric will keep you from sweating while the fitted style will keep your outfit from looking too baggy.",
        "Flowy style shorts often come with an elastic waist, making them more comfortable to wear and preventing them from digging in to your sides and tummy.",
        "Styling and Accessorizing Your Look Wear a belt to help define your waist.",
        "Whether you\u2019re a man or a woman, adding a belt is a great way to define your waistline and accentuate your figure.",
        "Depending on your outfit, you could choose a wide belt to make your waist look extra slim, or a skinny belt to add just a bit of definition.",
        "For a particularly comfortable option, try a belt with an adjustable back or elastic waistline.",
        "If you\u2019re a woman and want to add a bit of pizzazz to your outfit while still flattering your figure, try a belt with embellishments, such as jewels, stitching, or metallic hardware.",
        "Accessorize with a thicker, long necktie to elongate your midsection.",
        "When choosing a tie to wear to work or for special occasions, opt for ties that are at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide and that are long enough to hit right at your waistband.",
        "This will help slim out your upper body and hide your belly if it protrudes out a bit.",
        "While skinny ties can look trendy and you should certainly try out the style if you want, they could make your upper body appear wider than it is.",
        "Use statement jewelry to highlight your best physical qualities.",
        "To look cute when you\u2019re a heavy set woman, try wearing statement jewelry strategically to help you balance out your outfit and draw attention away from the parts of your body you want to conceal.",
        "If you\u2019re insecure about your upper arms but you\u2019re planning to wear a sleeveless dress, for example, try accessorizing with thick, enamel bangles.",
        "Not only are these bracelets on-trend, they\u2019ll draw attention away from your upper arms and down to your wrists.",
        "Wearing long, chandelier earrings is a great way to both elongate your neck and draw attention up to your face and away from your lower body.",
        "Try highlights or lowlights to make your hair look light and fresh.",
        "Whether you have blond, brown, black, or red hair, a single block of the same hair color can weigh you down.",
        "Therefore, talk to your hair stylist about trying out highlights or lowlights.",
        "This will give your hair a bit of visual interest and depth, making your whole look appear a bit lighter.",
        "Lowlights and highlights will also help cover up any grey hairs that might start to spring up over time.",
        "Go for pointy-toed shoes to elongate your legs.",
        "While they may not always be the most comfortable option, pointy-toed shoes are great way to make you look instantly slimmer.",
        "The pointed-toe on the shoes will make your silhouette appear longer and leaner.",
        "If you\u2019re a woman, pointy-toed heels will help elongate your legs.",
        "If you have thicker ankles or calves, avoid styles with t-straps or ankle straps, as these can cut off your leg line and make your legs appear shorter and wider.",
        "To make your legs look even longer, go for nude shoe that\u2019s close to your skin tone.",
        "Avoid tiny bags and purses that aren\u2019t proportional to your body.",
        "While they look cute on the shelf at the store, carrying a small bag or purse runs the risk of making your body look larger than it is.",
        "Since you\u2019ll generally carry your bag over your shoulder so that it falls at your waist, choose a medium to large bag that will make your waist look smaller by comparison.",
        "While you want your bag to make your waist look smaller, an extra-large bag will only hide your figure.",
        "Instead, choose an outfit that makes you feel cute and use your bag to further accentuate your beautiful figure.",
        "Selecting the Right Undergarments for Women Get a professional bra fitting to avoid squeezing or bulging.",
        "Visit a lingerie or department store and ask about getting a professional to measure you for a bra.",
        "Wearing the wrong size bra is one of the most common mistakes that women make.",
        "Wearing a bra that\u2019s too tight can squeeze your body and cause unwanted bulging across your back and chest.",
        "Therefore, it\u2019s important that you get professionally measured for a bra to ensure that you get the right style and size for your body.",
        "Even if you think you know your bra size in one style from one brand, your size may be completely different in another style or brand.",
        "Wear shapewear to smooth out your curves.",
        "Wearing shapewear under your clothes is a great way to smooth out your body and boost your confidence.",
        "Even if you choose the most flattering pieces of clothing, it can still be helpful to have that extra layer to help you smooth out and conceal any areas you feel insecure about.",
        "Plus, there are several different types and styles of shapewear, so you\u2019ll likely be able to find the right kind for your outfit.",
        "For example, if you\u2019re wearing a fitted dress and want to smooth out your whole body, try a shapewear bodysuit.",
        "If you\u2019re looking for shapewear that you can wear with almost any outfit, try a biker short style.",
        "This style reaches up to your natural waist at the top and down to your mid-thigh or knees at the bottom, effectively creating a long, smooth, lean line all the way down your midsection.",
        "Put on a bralette to cover up excess cleavage.",
        "If you have a large chest and want to tone down your cleavage, try wearing a simple lace bralette under your top.",
        "While bralettes don\u2019t generally provide a lot of support, it will give you a bit of extra fabric up top to cover up your bust and give you a more streamlined look.",
        "If you need more support for your bust, try getting a bralette in a larger size so you can wear your bra underneath.",
        "Invest in a slimming bodysuit that can double as a top.",
        "Unlike a separate top, which can ride up throughout the day, bodysuits tend to stay securely in place all day.",
        "In addition, there are several bodysuits available with built-in shapewear that will smooth out your tummy without having to add bulk or layers with a separate shirt.",
        "Bodysuits go great with a pair of high-waisted trousers or flowy shorts, as well as a high-waisted a-line skirt."
