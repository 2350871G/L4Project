Simply lift up the dog's ear to expose the skin and gently clean the area with the cotton dipped in the cleaner. Never put any cotton tips or cotton buds down into the ear canal. If the dog moves suddenly it could force the cotton bud deep into the ear and cause damage. The non-alcohol-based cleaner will not sting the dog's ear like alcohol may."

This is easier than trying to pull the paw toward you from the front. Try to identify the quick and leave a 4 to 5 millimeters length of nail to protect the quick. If you can't see the quick, nibble tiny amounts of nail away with the clippers just in case the dog has long quicks, which could bleed.
