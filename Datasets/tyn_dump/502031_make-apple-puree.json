Fuji and Gala apples are both sweet and cook great, and Granny Smith apples actually sweeten when you cook them. Although you\u2019re going to be removing the peel from the apples, it\u2019s best to wash them thoroughly first just so you start with a clean piece of fruit. After they are washed and dried, use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin. If you don\u2019t have a peeler, you can always use a knife. You can rinse your apples under water, or use a mixture of three parts water and one part vinegar. This will help to kill any bacteria on your apples. You can use as many apples as you like for this recipe. One apple yields approximately five ounces of puree, so you can plan accordingly."
