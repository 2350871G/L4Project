It is best to leave the widest part of the tile between the fence and the blade; this will help you keep your hand as far from the blade as possible. For cutting tiles along the diagonal, position a miter guide or speed square between the tile and the fence. This will keep the tile positioned at a 45 degree angle to the blade. For making partial cuts, for instance when making an L-shaped cutout to accommodate an electrical outlet, set the tile up in the same way as a complete cut. You will simply feed the tile only far enough into the blade to achieve the desired cut depth."
