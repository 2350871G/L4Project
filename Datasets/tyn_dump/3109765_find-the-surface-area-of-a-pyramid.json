        "Plug in the values for the side length and slant height into the formula.",
        "Make sure you substitute the side length of the base for b{\\displaystyle b} and the slant height for h{\\displaystyle h}.",
        "For example, if the length of one side of the base of a square pyramid is 4 cm, and the slant height is 12 cm, the formula will look like this: SA=42+4((4)(12)2){\\displaystyle SA=4^{2}+4({\\frac {(4)(12)}{2}})}.",
        "Square the side length of the base.",
        "This will give you the surface area of the base.",
        "For example:SA=42+4((4)(12)2){\\displaystyle SA=4^{2}+4({\\frac {(4)(12)}{2}})}SA=16+4((4)(12)2){\\displaystyle SA=16+4({\\frac {(4)(12)}{2}})} Multiply the side length of the base by the slant height and divide by two.",
        "Then, multiply by 4.",
        "This will give you the lateral surface area of the pyramid.",
        "For example:SA=16+4((4)(12)2){\\displaystyle SA=16+4({\\frac {(4)(12)}{2}})}SA=16+4(482){\\displaystyle SA=16+4({\\frac {48}{2}})}SA=16+4(24){\\displaystyle SA=16+4(24)}SA=16+96{\\displaystyle SA=16+96} Add the base surface area and the lateral surface area.",
        "This will give you the total surface area of the pyramid, in square units.",
        "For example:SA=16+96{\\displaystyle SA=16+96}SA=112{\\displaystyle SA=112}So, the total surface area of a square pyramid, with a base side length of 4 cm and a slant height of 12 cm, is 112 square centimeters."
