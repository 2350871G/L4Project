If you\u2019re concerned about the stain looking too dark, you are better off removing as much of it as you can now. You can always follow up with another coating if you need to darken it later. Finishing and Sealing the Stain Wait about 1 hour for the stain to dry. Leave the wood out in an open area with good air circulation so it dries out at a faster rate. Let everyone else in your home know not to touch it. Note that the drying time may vary a little bit depending on the weather. It dries out fastest during warm days with low humidity.Other staining products take up to a day to dry. The main advantage of Varathane is that it\u2019s so much quicker, so you can get to finishing the project right away. Apply Varathane to any surfaces you were unable to reach originally. Sometimes you aren\u2019t able to finish a piece as a consistent whole. Once the wood is dry to the touch, you can flip it over and begin addressing any sides you missed earlier. Coat these sides by spreading the Varathane in a thin layer along the grain. Remember to tackle small sections at a time so the Varathane doesn\u2019t dry out before you are able to clean up any excess.These surfaces will all need time to dry, too. Let them dry for an hour or else the finish will get ruined when you flip the wood back over. You might need to do this with a tabletop, for example. If you detached it from its legs and laid it on top of a drop cloth, you wouldn\u2019t be able to reach its underside without flipping it. Recoat the wood with additional layers of Varathane to darken the finish. One coating of Varathane is often enough to give wood a new, bright finish. Take a step back and examine the wood from a few different angles. If it looks too light or inconsistent, it could benefit from another coating. Spread more Varathane in small sections along the grain with a brush or rag.Most projects will look great after a single coating, or with 2 at most. Apply the stainer sparingly, since each layer darkens the finish. Remember to let each application dry for an hour. Also, flip the wood to recoat any surfaces you couldn\u2019t reach. Make sure they all receive the same amount of Varathane. Finish the wood with a clear top coat to protect it from damage. After the new stain has finished drying, seal it in. Polyurethane and lacquer are both water-resistant and good for finishing unsealed wood surfaces. Stir the clear coat in its container, then spread it along the wood\u2019s grain with a fresh brush or rag. Drag your brush along the grain again afterward to smooth out the coating and fill in any gaps.For the best result, apply 2 to 3 thin layers of clear coat. It will result in a smooth, shiny finish that lets the wood\u2019s new stain shine. To help clear coat layers adhere to one another, you could scrub them gently with a piece of 320-grit sandpaper. Let the clear coat dry for at least 24 hours. It\u2019s more waiting, but you\u2019re almost done. Leave the wood alone in a dry spot with plenty of air circulation. The exact drying time will vary depending on the weather. Make sure no one else touches the wood in the meantime. Once the wood is dry to the touch, you can proudly display the wood to enjoy its fresh finish.Remember to flip the wood over if you need to in order to cover sides you couldn't finish earlier. Give the fresh layer of clear coat another day to dry.",

        "Sand the wood lightly along its grain with 120-grit sandpaper.",
        "If you look closely at the wood, you will be able to see some small, dark lines running from one end to the other.",
        "The grain is the pattern of the fibers inside the wood, and following them is very important.",
        "Starting at one end of the wood, begin scrubbing with circular motions along the grain.",
        "When you reach the end, go back to start on an untreated portion of the wood, repeating until the entire piece has been sanded evenly.Going across the grain is a sure way to cause scratches that show up through the finish.",

        "Load the Varathane onto a foam brush.",

        "Keep the coating thin to avoid making the finish too dark.",
        "Treat 2.15 sq ft (0.200 m) sections at a time to prevent the stain from drying out.",
        "Since Varathane dries pretty quickly compared to other products, you\u2019re better off applying it in limited amounts.",
        "Cover small areas with each application.",
        "Make sure each part is saturated with a consistent coating of the stain before moving on to the next one.To get a consistent finish, let the Varathane sit for a couple of minutes, then wipe up the excess before beginning on the next section.",
        "You may not be able to finish a project in a single coat.",
        "With a tabletop, for instance, let the top dry completely, then flip it over to finish the underside.",
        "Wait 2 to 3 minutes for the stain to settle into the wood.",
        "If you\u2019re thinking that a couple of minutes seems like too short of a time for the stain to dry, you\u2019re right.",
        "The Varathane will settle into the wood during this time, but it won\u2019t begin drying.",
        "This will give you a chance to check the finish one last time before allowing it to dry.Expect Varathane to begin drying after 5 minutes.",
        "Make any adjustments to the finish before then.",

        "Scrub off any excess Varathane with a cloth before it dries.",
        "Go back over the coated portion of the wood with a clean cloth.",
        "Press the cloth down lightly while rubbing it along the grain.",
        "It will absorb any excess still on the wood so that the finish is more uniform.",
        "Spots with excess Varathane will turn darker than the rest of the wood, so be aware of any areas that look wet or inconsistent.You don\u2019t have to remove the stainer, but it\u2019s worth doing to ensure that the final coloring isn\u2019t overly dark or spotty.",
        "If you think that the coating looks even and is the color you want, you can leave it alone.",
        "If you\u2019re concerned about the stain looking too dark, you are better off removing as much of it as you can now.",
