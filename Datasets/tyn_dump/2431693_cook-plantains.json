If you prefer them less sweet, look for a plantain that's mostly yellow with some black spots. Green plantains are the firmest and least sweet, so you might choose these if you want a more savory dish. You can usually find plantains near the bananas at the grocery store. Although plantains are similar, they contain more starch and less sugar than bananas."
