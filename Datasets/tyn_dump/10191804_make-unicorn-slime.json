        "This is not your regular air-dry ceramic, polymer, or paper clay.",
        "It's a special type of clay that dries lightweight and somewhat squishy.",
        "It feels a little like a hardened marshmallow once dry.",
        "Knead the clay and the slime together until you get a soft, buttery consistency.",
        "Japanese dollar stores, such as Daiso, sell this type of clay.",
        "You can also use \"Model Magic\" by Crayola, or something similar.",
        "Make more colors, if desired, and/or add some glitter.",
        "Make each batch of color separately, then squish them together to form a swirl of colors.",
        "Sprinkle some glitter in a matching color onto the slime, then knead it in.",
        "Great unicorn colors include: pink, blue, and purple.",
        "You could even try some teal!",
        "Extra-fine glitter works great, but you can use shaped glitter too, like hearts or stars.",
        "Store the slime in an airtight container for up to 1 week.",
        "Because this type of slime contains shaving cream, it may lose some of its fluffiness after a couple of days.",
        "You can still play with it like regular slime, however."
