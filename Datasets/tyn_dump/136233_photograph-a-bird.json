Look for a camera that can shoot in RAW file format and has an auto-focus feature so your pictures are clear. If you want to take larger or clearer pictures, choose a camera that has a high-quality sensor and higher megapixels. If you\u2019re on a budget, you can buy a used camera instead.

To avoid disturbing your avian subjects while taking the best pictures possible, look for lenses that have a focal length of at least 400mm.
