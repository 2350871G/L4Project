External hard drives and other USB flash drives are sometimes formatted to work with one operating system (OSX or Windows) only. Depending on the computers you're transferring between you may need to reformat to a more universal formatting option (FAT32) before attempting the transfer.

Eject the drive and connect to the client laptop. Make sure to disconnect properly to avoid damaging the files, then drag and drop to the client laptop's desktop or another more appropriate location. Transferring Via the Cloud Choose a cloud storage service. Companies like Dropbox, Google Drive and many others offer cloud storage for your most important files and can also act as an effective file transfer method between laptops. You'll need an account with one of these providers (initial membership and some storage space is typically free). The limitations to this method will be storage space, upload time, and potential cost -  however if you need to move smaller files on a more frequently basis this may be a great solution for you. Move your files into the cloud. Depending on the service this may be as simple as dragging and dropping the files to your open internet browser, or could involve a more formal file upload procedure. Wait while the cloud service uploads your files in full. Access your cloud account from the client computer. Download the files you want to this laptop and the transfer is complete! Cloud services also provide extra security through consistent file backup and the possibility of collaborative file editing, so getting to know cloud storage may be a smart move for you regardless! Connecting Directly with Firewire Check the compatibility of your laptops. Both laptops will require a firewire input and you will need an appropriate firewire cord to connect them. This method makes the most sense if you are transferring between either two Macs or two PCs. If instead you are transferring between operating systems then look into a different method. Plug in both ends of the firewire. Firewire plugs take a few different forms - double check you have the right cord and appropriate adaptors to fit both of your laptops before beginning. Access the server computer through the client computer. Use the client laptop (the one you want files transferred to) to find and access the server laptop (the one with the files). Once connected it should appear on the desktop or else where external drives normally appear. Drag and drop files as normal. Now that your laptops are directly connected you can shift files as needed, similar to any other file management on your computer. Emailing Attachments to Yourself Set the receiver of the email as your own email address. Emailing yourself can be a quick and simple way to send one or two smaller-sized files to a different computer, for anything more try one of the other methods. Attach files to the email. Different email clients (e..g gmail, hotmail, yahoo) have different attachment size limitations. Some allow you to drag and drop files directly to the email body while others require you to click \"attach\" and then browse your computer's file trees. Log into your email on the client computer. Now download the attachment.
