        "After 1 to 2 days, you should see tiny green shoots poking out from the growing medium.",
        "When that happens, remove and discard the plastic wrap, and place the tray by a window that gets at least 4 to 6 hours of sunlight.",
        "If you\u2019re growing several trays of wheatgrass or don\u2019t have a suitable window, you can also keep your seedlings under a 150-watt fluorescent lamp.",
        "Harvest the grass when it\u2019s about 6 to 7 in (15 to 18 cm) tall.",
        "The sprouts should be ready to clip about 8 to 10 days after planting.",
        "Cut them just above the level of the growing medium with a pair of sterilized scissors.",
        "To sterilize your scissors, wipe them with a paper towel soaked in 90% rubbing alcohol.",
        "Alternative, wipe them with a mixture of 10 parts water to 1 part bleach, then rinse away the bleach solution with hot water.",
        "Rinsing isn't necessary if you use the alcohol method.",
        "Sterilizing your scissors will help prevent disease and keep the wheatgrass healthy enough to grow back for a second clipping.",
        "Wash and enjoy your harvested sprouts.",
        "Rinse your harvested wheatgrass under running water, then juice it or chop it and top soups and salads with it.",
        "After harvesting, refrigerate wheatgrass in a tightly sealed container for up to 7 days.Tip: After the first clipping, your wheatgrass will start to grow back, just like your lawn.",
        "You can continue to maintain the grass and clip it again after another 8 to 10 days.",
        "The nutritional value decreases with each clipping, so it\u2019s best to compost or dispose of the tray\u2019s contents after 2 clippings."
