Boosters aren't typically used on their own; however, they can be used with a disposable brief or pull-up for maximum absorbency. There are boosters available that make it possible for you to get through the day without changing them. If you have a long day of classes or are tailgating at a football game, it may be worth looking into this option! If your incontinence issues are only minor, pads may be your best bet, as they can be worn with different types of underwear including regular (snug fitting) or specialty made underwear."

Today you won't have a difficult time finding waterproof products, which keep both you and your mattress dry. The goal is to reduce damage and excessive laundry. A waterproof mattress pad should be on your must buy list. With the ability to hold up to 6 cups of fluid, pads provide absorbency as well as moisture protection. You may want to consider vinyl mattress covers, as they lock out moisture and serve as an inexpensive way to add years of life to your mattress."
