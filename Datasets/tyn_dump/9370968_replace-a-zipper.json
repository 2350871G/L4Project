Identify how much you need to shorten the zipper and then mark your zipper fabric. Cut of the excess zipper by cutting straight across the zipper fabric and teeth. Make sure to install a new zipper pull stop if you shorten the zipper. A zipper pull stop goes at the bottom of your zipper and prevents the zipper pull from coming off when you unzip the zipper. You can get zipper pull stops in craft stores. They look like small rectangles with prongs extending from the sides. To install a new zipper pull stop, push the prongs into the fabric right below the last zipper teeth. Then, close the prongs on the backside with pliers. If needed, install a zipper pull stop on each side of the zipper so that you can still open it all the way."
