                    "description": "The most common symptom of a clogged fuel pump is an intermittent power loss caused by the pump failing to push enough fuel to the injectors to keep the engine running properly. If your engine sputters or even stalls when you take your foot off of the gas, there may be an issue with your fuel pump or filter. If the engine stalls, but then will run again after a few minutes, it\u2019s likely because of sediment building up in the fuel filter or pump. As the sediment settles, the blockage clears and that fuel will begin to flow until it builds up again. You should also consider replacing your fuel filter."

        "Disconnecting the battery is especially important when working with fuel to ensure nothing within the vehicle can produce a spark.",
        "Tuck the negative cable to the side of the battery to ensure it doesn\u2019t come into contact with the terminal by accident.",
        "Locate the fuel pump.",
        "Mechanical fuel pumps are usually found on the engine, rather than in the fuel tank, because they rely on the crankshaft to power them.",
        "Refer to an application specific repair or service manual to help you identify and locate the mechanical fuel pump in your particular vehicle, as they can vary widely in appearance and location.",
        "Most mechanical fuel pumps will have a portion that looks like a metal circle with a nozzle coming out of the top or bottom.",
        "Mechanical fuel pumps are usually only found in older vehicles.",
        "Place a container beneath the vehicle to catch any leaking fuel.",
        "Depending on how the fuel pump is mounted, there\u2019s a high likelihood that you\u2019ll spill at least some fuel in this process.",
        "Slide a container beneath the vehicle directly under the fuel pump you\u2019ll be working on to catch any fuel spillages as you work.",
        "Make sure the container you use is rated for fuel.",
        "Gasoline can melt through some types of plastic.",
        "Containers rated to hold gasoline will be labeled as such.",
        "If your container is not labeled, do not assume it can hold gasoline.",
        "Remove any fuel lines only if they\u2019re in the way.",
        "There will be two fuel lines on the pump (an in and an out).",
        "If possible, leave them in place as you open the fuel pump, but if you have to remove one or both to access the internal filter on your specific vehicle, do so by either unscrewing the lines or by loosening the hose clamps that are holding them securely on their nozzles.",
        "Once the clamps are loose, just pull the line backward off of the nozzle.",
        "Make sure any fuel draining from the line falls into the container you slid beneath the car.",
        "If you have zip ties, you can zip tie the lines with the opening facing up to prevent any more fuel from pouring out.",
        "You\u2019ll need to break or cut the zip ties when reconnecting the lines.",
        "Remove the central screw or nut from the top of the fuel pump housing.",
        "There will be a nut or a bolt sticking out of the top of the mechanical fuel pump that holds the cover over the fuel filter.",
        "Find it and then use the correct sized wrench to remove it so you can access the filter inside.",
        "In some pumps, there may be a cylindrical filter housing on the top that you can unscrew by hand, instead of a bolt or nut.",
        "Others may use pipe clips to hold the cover in place.",
        "Loosen the screws securing them or pull them off with pliers, depending on the type of clip.",
        "Clean the filter with a brush without removing it.",
        "Look into the fuel pump to see the filter, which will look like a screen.",
        "Don\u2019t try to remove the filter, but instead use a clean paint brush to sweep away any debris blocking the filter.",
        "You can dip the paint brush in new gasoline to make it easier for the debris to stick to the bristles of the brush.",
        "Use a medium sized paint brush to remove large and small bits of debris.",
        "The brush should be no wider than the body of the fuel pump.",
        "Many internal fuel filters for these pumps cannot be removed.",
        "In some vehicles, however, you can remove the filter and replace it if need be.",
        "Refer to a vehicle specific repair manual to help you determine if that\u2019s the case for your car or truck.",
        "Reassemble the fuel pump.",
        "Put the cover back on the fuel pump and then secure it in place using the bolt or nut you removed before.",
        "Reconnect any fuel lines that you disconnected and use hose clamps to make sure they\u2019re tight.",
        "You can purchase replacement hose clamps at your local auto parts store if you need them.",
        "Most hose clamps can be tightened with either a Phillips head screwdriver or a small wrench."
