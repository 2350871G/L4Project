With effort, you can get better at holding onto the dreams, images, and symbols after waking. When you wake, hold the dream in your mind\u2019s eye.

Try to figure where you were, what you were doing, who else appeared in your dream, and what was the interaction between you and others. Focus on these images rather than a narrative.

If you dream about flying or coming to class naked, for example, you are probably dreaming about suppressed fears rather than the future. You might try reading up on dream symbology to help in your self-analysis. The idea that dreams reflect the subconscious and can \u201csymbolize\u201d things in our minds was pioneered by psychologists like Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, for example. Pick up a copy of Freud\u2019s \u201cThe Interpretation of Dreams,\u201d if you feel up to it. Carl Jung even thought that some images in dreams access a \u201ccollective unconscious\u201d that cuts across all places and times.

The idea behind a dream dictionary is that images or symbols have definite meanings, which you can then plug into your dream. For example, you may encounter future trouble with your sexuality if you had a foreboding dream about a mongoose.
