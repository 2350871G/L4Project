You can also decorate the edges of the pouch with washi tape or glitter glue, and tie it off with a piece of baker's twine. Making an Asian Money Pouch Choose your paper. You want something that is easy to fold and crease, such as scrapbook paper, wrapping paper, or origami paper. You can use other types of paper in a pinch, however, including construction paper or even old calendars. If you want to make a traditional Chinese envelope, choose red. This pouch may also work for Eid. Draw a vertical rectangle in the center of your page. If you are working on pattered paper, work on the blank side. The rectangle needs to be 2\u00bc inches wide and 3\u00bd inches tall (5.72 centimeters wide and 8.89 centimeters tall). This will be the finished size of your pouch. Draw the bottom flap below the rectangle. The bottom flap needs to be \u00bd-inch (1.27 centimeters) tall and 2\u00bc inches (5.72 centimeters) wide. The bottom flap will eventually be on the outside of your envelop, so you might want to give it rounded or slanted corners for a neater finish. Draw the top flap above the rectangle. It needs to be 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) tall and 2\u00bc inches (5.72 centimeters) wide. Give the flap either rounded or slanted corners, whichever matches your bottom flap. Draw a 1\u215c-inch (3.5 centimeters) flap to the left of the rectangle. It needs to be the same height as your rectangle (3\u00bd inches/8.89 centimeters), so don't include the heights of the top and bottom flaps! Make the bottom of the flap straight, but angle the top edge down towards the outer edge by a little. This way, when you finish folding your envelope, you'll have a wide V-shape in the center. Draw a 1\u00bc-inch (3.18 centimeters) flap to the right of the rectangle. It needs to be the same height as your rectangle: 3\u00bd inches (8.89 centimeters) tall. Don't include the height of your upper and lower flaps. Make the bottom straight, and the top angled down towards the outer edge. Cut your envelope out. Follow the outer lines of your flaps. Do not cut out the inside rectangle; you will use those lines as guides for folding. Fold the right flap over. Use the line you drew at the beginning as a guide. Run your fingernail across the crease to make it extra sharp. Do not glue this flap down. Fold the left flap over. Run your fingernail along the crease to sharpen it, then glue or tape the long, side edge down. Use a glue stick or double-sided tape for this. Fold the bottom flap up and glue it down. Run your fingernail across the crease, then secure the flap with a glue stick or double-sided tape. Fold the top flap down. Do not glue or tape it, or you won't be able to put anything inside of it.
