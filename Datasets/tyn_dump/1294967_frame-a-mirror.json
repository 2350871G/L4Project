You will use these measurements to determine how long to cut the baseboards for the frame. This method works for framing basic mirrors that don't have any kind of rim or frames around them already. These types of mirrors are also known as floating mirrors or construction-ready mirrors. You can use this method to put a frame around a mirror that is already attached to a wall, or to frame a mirror before hanging it. The mirror needs to have straight edges to build a frame around it with baseboards."

You will use these measurements to determine how long to cut the baseboards for the frame. This method works for framing basic mirrors that don't have any kind of rim or frames around them already.

You can use this method to put a frame around a mirror that is already attached to a wall, or to frame a mirror before hanging it. The mirror needs to have straight edges to build a frame around it with baseboards. Purchase primed MDF baseboards to make the frame with. Go to a home improvement center and select the style of baseboards that you want.

Primed MDF baseboards are easy to paint so you can make them any color you want for the frame. Cut the baseboards to length with a miter saw. Measure and mark your baseboards to the lengths you need for the sides, top, and bottom. Place the baseboards in a miter box and cut them straight to the lengths that you need. For example, if your mirror is 2 ft (0.61 m) wide by 3 ft (0.91 m) tall, then you need 2 baseboards that are 2 ft (0.61 m) long and 2 that are 3 ft (0.91 m) long. Cut the corners of the baseboards to a 45-degree angle with a miter saw. Change the angle on the miter box to 45 degrees. Cut in from the corners of each board at a 45-degree angle down towards the inside edge of each board. This will make the frame fit nicely together in each corner. Paint the baseboards a color of your choice or leave them as is. Use a paintbrush to coat both the front and back of the baseboards (if you want to paint them). Leave them as is if you are fine with the color they came in (such as natural wood). It's important to paint the backs the same color as well because they can reflect in the mirror.

The mirror needs to be the same size as the glass that goes in the picture frame (if it has any).

If you can't find a frame and mirror that fit together, then you can have a mirror custom cut to fit a frame you want to use.

Once the mirror is secured to the frame, there are lots of ways you can decorate it, like by putting stencils on the glass of the mirror, or even gluing things like fabric or shells around the frame. Test the weight to make sure the hanging mechanism is strong enough. A mirror is heavier than a picture. Check by lifting up the mirror and frame slightly off the ground by its hanging mechanism (the wire or the hooks) to make sure it's strong enough to support the weight before you hang it to a wall. If the frame doesn't already have a hanging mechanism, or the existing one isn't strong enough, then you will have to hang it yourself. Framing Mirrors in Creative Ways Frame a mirror in a reclaimed wood door or window for a rustic frame. Mount pieces of mirror instead of the glass in an old, rustic-looking door or window frame. Get the mirror pieces custom-cut to the dimensions you need by a mirror and glass company. Mount the mirror with silicone adhesive. Make sure to remove any old glass pieces from the door or window before you mount the mirror pieces. Mount a mirror inside a vintage platter or tray for a unique mirror frame. Use silicone adhesive to attach a mirror inside of the tray or dish. Things like old cake pans or serving platters work well. You can go thrift shopping for cheap, vintage platters and dishes, then get a mirror custom-cut to fit perfectly. Glue anything you want around a plain mirror frame to decorate it. Use a hot glue gun to glue shells, sticks, ribbon, or anything else you can dream up around a regular old mirror frame to give it a new life. Let your imagination run wild! You could even glue tiles around a mirror to make a mosaic frame.",
