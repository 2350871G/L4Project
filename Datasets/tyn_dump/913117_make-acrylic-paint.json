Acrylic base is essentially paint without pigment. It will usually come in a squeezable tube and the substance itself will appear white.

Acrylic retarders are especially necessary if you are attempting to create photorealistic paintings or portraits of a human subject. Colors must be blended together on the canvas to create the contours of complex shapes, but fast-drying acrylics will set before a second color can be added."
