Measure down each side 2\u2033 and make a mark.  Draw lines to connect the marks, as shown, to form a point.  Cut along the two marked lines.  Complete your pattern by taping two non-pointed 11\u2033 strips of paper together and then tape your pointed strip into place on one end. It is easiest to do this if you overlap the paper very slightly and then tape it in place on both sides. You are finished with your pattern! Before placing your pattern to cut the fabric, you should iron the fabric. I always iron fabric before cutting anything out because it makes the pieces more exact and the finished product better. Fold your fabric so that the \u201cright sides\u201d face each other, place the pattern piece, and pin it in place. If your fabric has a distinct directional design, make sure your pattern is placed straight along the design instead of at a funny angle that will make the wraps look sideways. Cut along your pattern through both fabric thicknesses.  Repeat steps eight and nine to create the pieces for your second wrap.  Your fabric pieces should already be lined up and facing each other \u201cwrong side out.\u201d Make sure the ends line up and then pin them in place.  Using a straight stitch, stitch all the way around each set of pieces, but make sure to leave the top point open, as shown. I like to stitch about 1/4\u2033 away from the fabric\u2019s edges. If you take in commercial seam allowances of 5/8\u2033 using the pattern you just made, the wraps will be too narrow. Clip the two bottom corners on each wrap to remove excess fabric. This allows the finished wraps to have crisper points without awkward lumps. Turn the wraps right side out by pulling the fabric out through the open point.  Iron the turned wraps, making sure to turn under and press the unfinished edges along the open point.  Cut your tie material so you have two pieces that are each approximately 16-17\u2033 long. If you are using twill tape, you can simply knot one end of each tie to prevent the whole tie from fraying. I like to use paracord for my ties. I strip the inner white strands to use just the outer sheet and melt each end with a lighter to prevent unraveling. Insert a tie end through the open hole and pin it in place so that it is running down the point\u2019s middle and ends just below the \u201cshoulders\u201d of the wrap. Repeat for the second wrap. Carefully stitch straight across from shoulder to shoulder, stitching the tie\u2019s end in place in the process, on each wrap.  Starting at the point end, stitch all the way down the middle of each wrap.  Measure 18\u2033 up from the flat end of each wrap and mark it on both sides with a pin.  Straight stitch from one pin, down along the flat edge, and up to the other pin. Stitch no more than 1/4\u2033 away from the edge and try to keep the spacing as consistent as possible. Repeat on the other wrap. Change your machine to a zigzag stitch and use this stitch to top stitch where you have not straight stitched. In other words, the zigzag should go up and around the point, then back down the other side to meet the straight stitching. Overlap the zigzag with the straight stitch slightly, but about 1/2\u2033 or so. Repeat on the second wrap. Iron your wraps one last time and you are ready to go!
