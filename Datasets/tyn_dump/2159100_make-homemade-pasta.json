Toss your pasta in flour as soon as you finish forming it. This is especially important if you plan on drying and saving the pasta. Otherwise, the pasta will stick together as it dries. Cooking the Pasta Bring a large saucepan of water to boil. Fill your saucepan with cold water and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat. Add salt to the water to prevent the pasta from sticking as it cooks. Cook the pasta for 2 to 3 minutes. Add your pasta to the water and cook, stirring occasionally. Check for doneness after the first 3 minutes, and continue cooking until done. The pasta will be done once it feels soft but no longer sticky.
