Repeat all of these steps in exactly the same way for your second shoe. Easy Lacing Insert shoelace into the first eyelets of your first shoe. With the toe of the shoe pointed away from you, the first pair of eyelets is the pair farthest from you. Insert the left end of the shoelace into the left eyelet and the right end into the right eyelet. Finish right lace.
