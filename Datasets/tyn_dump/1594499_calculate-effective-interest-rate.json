The effective interest rate calculation does not take into account one-time fees like loan origination fees. These fees are considered, however, in the calculation of the annual percentage rate. Determine the stated interest rate. The stated (also called nominal) interest rate will be expressed as a percentage. The stated interest rate is usually the \"headline\" interest rate. It's the number that the lender typically advertises as the interest rate. Determine the number of compounding periods for the loan. The compounding periods will generally be monthly, quarterly, annually, or continuously. This refers to how often the interest is applied. Usually, the compounding period is monthly. You'll still want to check with your lender to verify that, though. Calculating the Effective Interest Rate Familiarize yourself with the formula for converting the stated interest rate to the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate is calculated through a simple formula: r = (1 + i/n)^n - 1. In this formula, r represents the effective interest rate, i represents the stated interest rate, and n represents the number of compounding periods per year. Calculate the effective interest rate using the formula above. For example, consider a loan with a stated interest rate of 5 percent that is compounded monthly. Using the formula yields: r = (1 + .05/12)^12 - 1, or r = 5.12 percent. The same loan compounded daily would yield: r = (1 + .05/365)^365 - 1, or r = 5.13 percent. Note that the effective interest rate will always be greater than the stated rate. Familiarize yourself with the formula used in case of continuously compounding interest. If interest is compounded continuously, you should calculate the effective interest rate using a different formula: r = e^i - 1. In this formula, r is the effective interest rate, i is the stated interest rate, and e is the constant 2.718. Calculate the effective interest rate in case of continuously compounding interest. For example, consider a loan with a nominal interest rate of 9 percent compounded continuously. The formula above yields: r = 2.718^.09 - 1, or 9.417 percent.

Find the number of intervals for a year. It is 2 for semi-annual, 4 for quarterly, 12 for monthly, 365 for daily. Number of intervals per year x 100 plus the interest rate.
