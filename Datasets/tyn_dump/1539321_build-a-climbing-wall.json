        "Always double-check your measurements before making the final cut in your wood.",
        "Set aside each board after you cut them to size.",
        "Purchase your boards from your local lumberyard or building supply store.",
        "Aim to have the width of your wall around 4 feet (1.2 m) and the height around 8 feet (2.4 m).. Assemble the boards into an outline of what you want the wall to look like.",
        "Lay the boards on the floor in the shape of your wall so the narrow edges of the boards are face up.",
        "Use either a nail gun or hammer where the planks meet and place at least 2 nails at each intersection.",
        "Once it\u2019s assembled, you\u2019ll have the outer edges of a frame for your climbing wall.",
        "If your wall is in a corner, make a frame for each climbing surface.",
        "You can also use screws and a drill to make your frames.",
        "If you want a wall that\u2019s 8 ft \u00d7 4 ft (2.4 m \u00d7 1.2 m), the outline of your frame will be the same size.",
        "Place vertical support beams every 16 in (41 cm) on center.",
        "Use a pencil and a tape measure to mark your horizontal boards where you need to place a support beam.",
        "Cut the beams to size and place them inside your frame, using a nail gun or hammer to set them in place.",
        "The term \u201con center\u201d refers to spacing the center of each board at the specific distance.",
        "In this case, the center of each support board should equal 16 in (41 cm).",
        "For a wall that\u2019s 4 ft (1.2 m) wide on the bottom, you would place 2 more support beams that are 7 \u20443 feet (2.3 m) in the middle of your frame.",
        "Anchor the framework to your existing wall or support system.",
        "Drill anchor screws through your frame and into the studs of your wall or support.",
        "Add screws every 12 in (30 cm) or wherever you notice the frame bowing away from your wall or support.",
        "Make sure you know where anything may be behind your walls, such as wiring or pipes.",
        "Avoid drilling into them.",
        "For a free-standing wall, make sure the support holds the full weight of the frame without tipping over.",
        "If there is any wobbling, add more weight to the base with extra boards.",
        "Adding the Handholds Cut \u20444 in (1.9 cm) plywood to match the size of your frame.",
        "Make sure you have non-perforated wood rather than particle wood for the best support.",
        "Use a table saw or circular saw to cut your plywood down to the correct size to fit the frame.",
        "Try to keep the boards in the largest sheets possible so you can easily put the wall together.",
        "Standard plywood sizes tend to be either 4 ft \u00d7 8 ft (1.2 m \u00d7 2.4 m) or 3 ft \u00d7 8 ft (0.91 m \u00d7 2.44 m).",

        "Use a \u204416 in (1.1 cm) drill bit for each hole you plan on making.",
        "If you want a clean layout, draw a grid on the plywood so each square is 8 in \u00d7 8 in (20 cm \u00d7 20 cm).",
        "Drill your holes where the lines intersect.",
        "If you want a more eclectic look, put the holes in random spots.",
        "How you drill the holes is a matter of preference.",
        "Either way will work for installing the handholds.",
        "Hammer T-nuts into the back of each hole.",
        "Use the same number of T-nuts as the number of holes you drilled into the plywood.",
        "Flip the sheet of plywood onto its back and use a hammer to pound the nuts into each hole.",
        "Make sure the back of the nut is flush with the back of the plywood.",
        "T-nuts serve as an anchor point to attach each of the handholds.",
        "Attach the plywood to the framework with nails or screws.",
        "Put a nail or screw in the top, middle, and bottom of the plywood at each support beam.",
        "If you place 2 pieces of plywood next to one another and notice that it\u2019s bowing, put another nail or screw in so it lays flat.",
        "Screw in the handholds to make different climbing routes.",
        "Place the hole in the handhold over one of the holes drilled in the wall.",
        "Use the screw provided with the handhold and a drill to secure it to the wall.",
        "Add as many handholds as you want depending on how easy or difficult you want the wall.",
        "Handholds can be purchased online or at specialty climbing stores.",
        "Some handholds can be attached with screws without a T-nut on the back.",
        "Make routes on the wall using different colored handholds.",
        "For example, space red handholds farther apart to make a difficult route or place green handholds close together to make an easy route.",
        "Place soft padding under the wall in case of falls.",
        "Place foam gymnastic mats or thin mattress under the walls so you have a cushion in case you fall off the wall.",
        "Cover the area around your wall since you will not always fall straight down next to the wall.",
        "Use thicker padding or double-layer what you have if you have a wall going higher than 8 feet (2.4 m)."
