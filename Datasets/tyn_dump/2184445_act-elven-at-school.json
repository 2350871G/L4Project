            "description": "Try wearing gypsy-style or bohemian clothing. For a forest elf, green, brown, blue, silver, white and beige are good colors to start with. Make sure they fit on you. Also, peasant tops and maxi skirts are a great choice. Sandals in the summer and ankle or knee long boots are good for winter. Animal prints like zebra and leopard are a bad idea. Let your hair grow long and keep it down or in a bohemian style in a natural hair color not too far away from your own as this can look unnatural."

            "description": "This restricts you greatly in the clothes department but you can still work the look. Wear (if you can) more floaty, lightweight skirts and not too short (elves are modest and elegant). Move away from chunky, stocky clothing and try to keep it as elegant as you can. Accessories are helpful: wear delicate silver necklaces, rings or bracelets but do not go overboard. Clipping tiny flower clips or wearing a flower head circlet is perfect for this look so long as it doesn't clash with your uniform. Shoes should not make noises as elves are known for being silent in their movement."
