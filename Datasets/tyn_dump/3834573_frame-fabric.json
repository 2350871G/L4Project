Then, trim the fabric roughly 2 inches (5.1 cm) wider than the circle you drew. Don\u2019t worry about being precise with your cutting. As long as it is bigger than the small hoop and you have some overhang, you will be fine. If you are working with a fabric that has a small, continuous pattern, you can place the hoop anywhere on the fabric since the display will look identical no matter which part you frame. For larger or uneven patterns, you may need to spend more time choosing a portion of fabric to center and display. You can use any scissors for cutting the fabric.

Then, choose a fabric that matches your decor and purchase enough to fill the frame, plus a little extra. You can choose any style, weight, or pattern of fabric. Look for something that complements your decor. Maybe choose a specific color from your couch pillows that you want to bring out or a pattern from your rug that will tie the whole room together. Repeating patterns are very interesting and visually appealing when they are framed. If you have an elaborate print, consider using a simpler frame so that the print becomes the focal point. In contrast, if you have a simpler or smaller print, try spicing it up with a decorative or vintage frame. Remove the backing from the frame. Using pliers or your fingers, lift the tabs up on the reverse side of the frame and remove the backing. Dispose of any paper, tags, or stickers that came with the frame. Keep the backing so that you can close the frame again after you place the fabric inside. Measure and trim the fabric to fit the frame. To measure the fabric, place the backing over the fabric, wrong-side up, and trace around it with a pen or marker. Trim the fabric down along the lines you drew.
