Your rubber band and paper clip necklace is now ready for wearing out. Spiral floral rubber band necklace Use the large pinkish-colored rubber bands commonly found in offices for large piles of paper. The rubber bands must be wide and of good quality. Sit a rubber band flat. Run a length of glue along one side of the flattened band. Carefully roll the rubber band into a spiral. The glued part should be rolled into. Hold in place with your fingers. Or, place a clothes peg or similar over the roll to hold it in place until it dries firmly. Repeat for as many times as you would like to have the spirals on the necklace length.  Assemble the necklace. Glue each spiral together in a large circle or oval shape. When you reach the end, try it on for fit. If you're happy with the length, attach a hook and clasp to allow you to open and close the necklace. Dangly rubber band necklace Decide how long you would like the necklace to be. This will affect how many ring links you need, as well as the amount of rubber bands you'll need. Choose a selection of differently colored rubber bands.
