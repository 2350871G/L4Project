Start by heating your oven to 150 degrees F (65.5 C). Then turn off the heat. Place hot water (in one dish) and ammonia (in another) in your oven. Heat some water on your stove to boiling.

Cleansing With Lemons Create a citrus solution. Cut 2 large lemons in half. Squeeze the juice from both lemons into a baking dish, and place the lemon halves in the dish as well. Fill this dish one third of the way with warm water. Meanwhile, pre-heat your oven to 250 degrees F (121 C). Bake the citrus solution for 30-60 minutes. Place the baking dish of citrus solution on the middle rack of your oven, and bake for 30-60 minutes, depending on how much build-up you have. Allow the oven to cool. Once the citrus solution has had a chance to bake, carefully remove the dish (retaining the solution), and turn off the oven. Allow the oven to cool for another 30-45 minutes, and remove your oven racks. Scrub the oven with the citrus solution. Using your reserved citrus solution, along with a sponge and/or scouring pad, scrub the inside of your oven. Grease and grime should come off easily. There is no need to rinse this solution.
