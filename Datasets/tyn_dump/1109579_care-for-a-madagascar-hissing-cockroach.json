                    "description": "For best results, opt for a simple glass fish tank that you can repurpose as a cockroach habitat. Get a tank with a snap-on lid with ventilation holes to keep your hisser from pushing the lid off. Finally, put petroleum jelly around the top rim of the tank to make it even harder for your roach to escape. This is an appropriately sized tank for a single cockroach, but you can also comfortably store up to 15 cockroaches in a 5 US gal (19 L) tank. If you want to house more than 15, add about 1 gallon (3.8 L) of volume to the tank for every additional 5 cockroaches. This may seem like overkill, but Madagascar hissing cockroaches are very good at climbing, even on flat surfaces. You definitely need to make it as hard as possible for your roach to climb out of its habitat and escape. Make sure the ventilation holes on your snap-on lid are small enough to keep your roach from crawling through them. The holes should be no larger than \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) in diameter."

To make the habitat even better, add an egg carton or a cardboard tube to the tank as a hiding spot for your roach.

Use a thermometer attached to the side of the tank to monitor its internal temperature. The best way to maintain control over the temperature of the tank is to keep it in a climate-controlled part of your house (e.g., a room where the temperature is constantly kept at around 80 \u00b0F (27 \u00b0C)). Ultimately, it will be very hard for you to make the temperature in the tank too high. Madagascar hissing cockroaches can tolerate temperatures as high as 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C)."
