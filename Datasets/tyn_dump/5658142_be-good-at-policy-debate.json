As for shoes, it is wise to wear black or brown dress shoes. The more professional you look, the better chance you have at winning the ballot. For the ladies, you may want to wear a nice dress, slacks or a business skirt. As for shirts, you could wear a button-up one with a tie, or go for a dress shirt with a black cardigan or suit jacket. It all depends on what you feel comfortable in. A good majority of female debaters wear heels but flats look just as presentable and won't hurt your feet as badly. When you walk into the debate round, if you look nicer and more presentable than the other team, you already have a better chance at winning the ballot."

Shake their hand and smile before you sign the ballot. After you sign the ballot, greet the other team and shake their hands also. Then you and the other team need to agree on a place to speak from.

The speaker order is as follows: 1AC- 2N CX, 1NC- 1A CX, 2AC- 1N CX, 2NC- 2A CX, 1NR, 1AR, 2NR, 2AR. Knowing how to debate Expect your coach to teach you this part in time. However, at its most basic, be aware that every year the debate community is presented with a resolution.

Being negative can be really fun or it can be really awful. It depends on how you approach the round. As the negative team, you can do pretty much whatever you want. The affirmative has a little circle that is known as the affirmative ground (the resolution), the negative has all of the grounds outside of the little circle.

Topicality is the most common argument the negative runs. It has to include the following:\nDefinition of the word the affirmative violates.
