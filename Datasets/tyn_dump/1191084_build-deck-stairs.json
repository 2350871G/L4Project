The first thing you need to do is find where your stairs will end, or where the landing spot will be. Picture a line running from the edge of your deck down to the ground at a 40-degree angle. Place a tape measure on the ground where you think the stairs will end. It does not have to be measured precisely. The 40-degree slope should start the bottom of the support beam of the deck because this is where the stringers will be attached.

Use a 4 ft (1.2 m) level to make sure the board is level above the landing spot.Tip: Anchor the board to keep it from falling by putting a heavy object on top of the end of the board on the deck. Measure the total rise from the landing spot to the straight board. Use a tape measure to measure from the landing spot on the ground to the bottom of the straight board to find the approximate height, or total rise, of your stairs. Write down the measurements so you can calculate the materials later. Divide the total rise by 7 to find the approximate amount of steps. Take the measurement you made of the total rise, divide it by 7, and round the number to find the total number of stairs you\u2019ll need for your deck. If you have a number with a decimal that is 0.5 or more, then round the number up. If your number is less than 0.5, then round the number down. For example, if your total rise was 60 inches (150 cm), then divide that number by 7 to get 8.57. Round that number up to get 9 stairs. Write down this number to use in your calculations. Find the rise of each step by dividing the total rise by the number of steps. The actual rise, or height, of each step can be calculated by dividing the total rise by the approximate number of stairs. This will tell you how tall each step will be. For example, if your total rise is 60 inches (150 cm) and your approximate number of steps is 9, divide 60 inches (150 cm) by 9 to get 6.67 inches (16.9 cm) per step. Most building codes say stair risers should not be taller than 7.75 inches (19.7 cm). Use tread boards that are at least 10 inches (25 cm) wide. The treads boards create the part of the stair that you step on. According to many building codes, the stair treads should be at least 36 inches (91 cm) long  10 inches (25 cm) wide. The number of steps you calculated is the number of treads that you\u2019ll need. Find the length of the staircase by calculating the length of the stringers. Stringers are boards that have sawtoothed or stair-shaped notches cut into them and run diagonally along the length of the stairs to support them. To find their length, add together the square of the run, or tread, and the square of the rise. Then take that number, find the square root, and multiply it by the number of steps to find the actual length of the stringers you\u2019ll need. For example, if your tread is 10 inches (25 cm), square 10 by multiplying the number by itself, which gives you 100. If your rise is 7 inches (18 cm), square that number by multiplying it by itself to get 49. Add 100 to 49 to get 149, then find the square root of 149, which is 12.206. Multiply that by the number of steps that you have to find the total length of your stringers. Making the Stringers Cut custom stringers out of 2 in (5.1 cm) by 12 in (30 cm) boards. The stringers are what you\u2019ll attach your treads and risers to, and it\u2019s often difficult or impossible to find pre-fabricated stringers that will fit your deck stairs. You\u2019ll need to cut your own. Most building codes stipulate that the stair stringers can\u2019t have notches (saw-toothed or stair-shaped cuts) that are deeper than half the width of the board, or the stringer will be too weak. Use a framing square to mark a sawtoothed pattern as cutting guidelines. Set your framing square to the height of the riser and width of the stair tread and use a carpenter\u2019s pencil to trace along the edges of the framing square to form a sawtooth pattern of steps onto a 2 in (5.1 cm) by 12 in (30 cm) board. Lay the square on the board and mark the lines, then slide the square down and align it with the previous mark before adding the next ones. The sawtooth or stair-shaped pattern should match the rise and tread measurements. Cut the notches into the board using a circular saw. Let the blade come to full speed before you cut the wood and cut the saw-tooth notches out by following the guidelines you marked. Don\u2019t cut all the way through the guidelines. Be careful when operating a circular saw. Wear safety goggles to prevent sawdust from entering your eyes. Finish the notch cuts with a handsaw. The circular saw will cut most of the notch out, but you\u2019ll need to use a handsaw to finish up the cuts without sawing beyond the cut lines. Fit the handsaw into the cut lines and use a back and forth motion to finish the cuts. Take care not to cut past the guidelines you marked or it could weaken the stringers. Repeat the process to cut another stringer. You need at least 2 stringers to support your deck stairs, so use the same measurements and mark a 2 in (5.1 cm) by 12 in (30 cm) board to be cut. Use the circular saw to cut the notches and finish the cuts with a hand saw to separate another stringer from the board. It should be the exact same measurements and cuts as your first stringer.Tip: Use the first stringer that you cut to draw your markings on the boards to cut the rest of your stringers. Finishing the Deck Stairs Screw each stringer to the bottom of the deck frame with a drill. Use L-brackets and 3 in (7.6 cm) deck screws to attach the stringers to your deck. Place the top of the stringer against the bottom of the frame of the deck and screw an L-bracket on each side of the stringer to connect it to the deck. After you\u2019ve attached the first stringer, connect the second stringer to the deck by following the same process. Cut the risers to the length of the top of the stringer.

        "Set your framing square to the height of the riser and width of the stair tread and use a carpenter\u2019s pencil to trace along the edges of the framing square to form a sawtooth pattern of steps onto a 2 in (5.1 cm) by 12 in (30 cm) board.",
        "Lay the square on the board and mark the lines, then slide the square down and align it with the previous mark before adding the next ones.",
        "The sawtooth or stair-shaped pattern should match the rise and tread measurements.",
        "Cut the notches into the board using a circular saw.",
        "Let the blade come to full speed before you cut the wood and cut the saw-tooth notches out by following the guidelines you marked.",
        "Don\u2019t cut all the way through the guidelines.",
        "Be careful when operating a circular saw.",
        "Wear safety goggles to prevent sawdust from entering your eyes.",
        "Finish the notch cuts with a handsaw.",
        "The circular saw will cut most of the notch out, but you\u2019ll need to use a handsaw to finish up the cuts without sawing beyond the cut lines.",
        "Fit the handsaw into the cut lines and use a back and forth motion to finish the cuts.",
        "Take care not to cut past the guidelines you marked or it could weaken the stringers.",
        "Repeat the process to cut another stringer.",
        "You need at least 2 stringers to support your deck stairs, so use the same measurements and mark a 2 in (5.1 cm) by 12 in (30 cm) board to be cut.",
        "Use the circular saw to cut the notches and finish the cuts with a hand saw to separate another stringer from the board.",
        "It should be the exact same measurements and cuts as your first stringer.Tip: Use the first stringer that you cut to draw your markings on the boards to cut the rest of your stringers.",
        "Finishing the Deck Stairs Screw each stringer to the bottom of the deck frame with a drill.",
        "Use L-brackets and 3 in (7.6 cm) deck screws to attach the stringers to your deck.",
        "Place the top of the stringer against the bottom of the frame of the deck and screw an L-bracket on each side of the stringer to connect it to the deck.",
        "After you\u2019ve attached the first stringer, connect the second stringer to the deck by following the same process.",
        "Cut the risers to the length of the top of the stringer.",
        "Set a riser against the edges of the stringers facing out and use a ruler and pencil to mark cutting guidelines where the riser needs to be trimmed to fit.",
        "Use a circular saw to trim the riser, cutting along the guidelines until you cut through the whole board.",
        "Repeat the process until all of the risers have been cut to size.",
        "Use the first riser that you cut to make your guidelines on the rest of the boards so you have a uniform length.",
        "Attach the risers with 3 in (7.6 cm) deck screws.",
        "Place the risers against the edges of the stringers facing out from the staircase.",
        "Use a drill to drive the 3 in (7.6 cm) deck screws through the risers and into the edge of stringers where they connect until all of the screw is in the wood.",
        "Use at least 2 deck screws to firmly secure the riser to the stringer.",
        "Don\u2019t drill too far into the wood or it could crack.",
        "Trim the treads and drill them onto the stringers.",
        "Once you\u2019ve attached the risers, take your 1.5 in (3.8 cm) by 10 in (25 cm) tread boards and cut them to 36 inches (91 cm) in length.",
        "Then, lay them across the stringers facing up.",
        "Use 3 in (7.6 cm) deck screws to attach the treads to the stringers by drilling through the tread boards and into the edges of the stringers where they connect.",
        "Use at least 2 deck screws to attach the tread boards.Warning: Make sure none of the screws are sticking out of the wood or someone could step on it."
