        "Using plants will prevent the adult fish from eating all of the baby guppies, but it\u2019s likely that some of the babies will still get eaten.",
        "They only way to guarantee the babies won\u2019t get eaten is to place them in a separate tank.",
        "Creating the Perfect Environment Keep the tank temperature between 76 to 80 \u00b0F (24 to 27 \u00b0C).",
        "This is the optimal temperature for keeping the baby guppies comfortable and hungry so they'll eat enough food for healthy growth.",
        "If your tank temperature isn\u2019t within this range, you can install a heater in your tank.",
        "Choose a heater that can handle the capacity of your tank.",
        "Cold water will make your fish too sluggish, while very warm water can harm the fish.",
        "To check the precise temperature of your water, use a thermometer that sticks to the side of your tank.",
        "You can find a tank heater at a local pet store or online.",
        "Install a filter in your fish tank to keep the water clean.",
        "Follow the directions on your filter model to place it in the tank.",
        "Baby guppies don\u2019t have a strong immune system, so they\u2019re vulnerable to disease.",
        "A filter can keep your water clean enough to protect the fry, though you still need to change the water often.",
        "It\u2019s best to put a thin fishnet or sponge over the intake valve in your filter, where water is pulled into the filter.",
        "That way, the baby guppies can\u2019t get pulled into the filter.",
        "Make sure you read all of the instructions that come with your filter.",
        "Clean the tank weekly because a dirty tank can cause illness.",
        "Scoop the baby guppies out of their tank using a cup or fish net.",
        "Then, pour the old water out of the tank.",
        "Wipe any algae or grime from the sides of the tank.",
        "Finally, refill it with fresh, clean water that\u2019s been treated for chlorine.",
        "Wait until the tank thermometer reaches the optimal temperature for your guppies before you return them to the tank.",
        "If you can\u2019t change the water every week, replace at least 1/4 of the water each week with fresh, clean water.",
        "Chlorine can harm your fish, but you can neutralize it.",
        "Purchase chlorine treatment tablets or liquid from your local pet store or online.",
        "If you don't have this, let the water sit out for 24 hours before you use it to replace the water in your fish tank.",
        "Turn on the tank light for 8 to 12 hours a day so their spines grow.",
        "Baby guppies that grow up in dim lighting may develop deformities, especially in their spine.",
        "A regular tank light installed in the top of your tank is all you need to give your fish light.",
        "Turn the light on in the morning, then turn it off in the evening.",
        "Don\u2019t leave the light on longer than 14 hours a day, as the baby guppies need to be able to sleep.",
        "Feeding Your Baby Guppies Feed your baby guppies every 2-3 hours for the first 6 weeks.",
        "They need to eat 5-6 times a day when they\u2019re very small.",
        "After the first 6 weeks, it\u2019s okay to decrease your feedings to every 4-5 hours, which will be 3-4 times per day.",
        "It\u2019s best to give your guppies a mixture of fresh and dry food, if you can.",
        "If you can\u2019t give your fish a mix of fresh and dry food, choose the best dry food you can find.",
        "Look for one that\u2019s labeled as providing all of the necessary nutrients for baby livebearing fish.",
        "Give your baby guppies ground up dry food for baby livebearing fish.",
        "The food may come already ground up, or you might need to grind it yourself.",
        "Sprinkle the food into the tank at feeding times.",
        "Watch to make sure the baby guppies are able to eat the bits of food.",
        "Read the label on the fish food to make sure you\u2019re feeding the fish in the right quantity.",
        "You can grind up the food using a mortar and pestle.",
        "If you don\u2019t have one, place the food on a plate, then grind it up with the back of a spoon.",
        "Don\u2019t feed your baby guppies large pieces of adult fish food, as they will be too small to eat this food.",
        "Check the label to make sure the food you choose is appropriate for baby fish.",
        "Add dried blood worms to the food for added nutrients.",
        "Baby guppies love the taste of bloodworms, so they\u2019ll gobble them right up.",
        "Make sure the blood worms are ground up, just like the dry food.",
        "You can feed them the bloodworms mixed into their dry food or separately, depending on your preference.",
        "You can feed your baby guppies bloodworms every day.",
        "Look for dried blood worms at your local pet store or online.",
        "Give your baby guppies freshly hatched brine shrimp as a supplement.",
        "Brine shrimp are very tasty to baby guppies.",
        "Plus, the shrimp are full of nutrients that will help the fish grow and develop a nice coloring.",
        "Offer brine shrimp at 1-2 feeding a days.",
        "Brine shrimp are available at local pet stores or online.",
        "Offer freshly hatched daphnia, as another supplement option.",
        "Daphnia are a type of aquatic crustacean.",
        "Like brine shrimp, they\u2019re very tasty to baby guppies and contain lots of nutrients.",
        "Offer the daphnia as a supplement at 1-2 feedings a day.",
        "You can buy daphnia at your local pet store or online.",
        "Monitoring Their Health Remove fry that show signs of deformity and illness.",
        "Baby guppies are especially vulnerable to illnesses caused by bacteria or aggression from other fish.",
        "Don\u2019t leave sick fish in your tank, as others may become ill, as well.",
        "You can either attempt to nurse the sick fry in a separate tank or dispose of them, as they're unlikely to thrive.",
        "If you notice the following symptoms, remove the affected fry from the tank:\nBent or warped spine\nSores\nTail rot\nFin rot Avoid medicating your tank, as you risk harming the fry.",
        "You can find medications to help treat common illnesses in guppies.",
        "However, these medications aren\u2019t appropriate for fry, unless you are very knowledgeable about dosing fish.",
        "It\u2019s better to remove ill fish from the tank rather than risking the health of the other fish.",
        "You can try to treat the sick fish in a separate tank.",
        "However, they\u2019re unlikely to thrive if they\u2019ve become ill at such a vulnerable stage.",
        "Place your baby guppies into your regular aquarium at 6-8 weeks old.",
        "Most baby guppies will be too big to eat at this point.",
        "Make sure they\u2019re bigger than the mouth of your adult fish before you put them in the aquarium.",
        "Otherwise, the bigger fish may still eat them.",
        "Your fish will continue to grow until they reach 6 months old, which is considered adulthood.",
        "You may notice some growth after your fish is an adult, but it will be minimal.",
        "Separate males and females if you don't want more babies.",
        "Female guppies usually start to reproduce at 2 to 3 months of age.",
        "Additionally, they can store sperm for up to 3 months.",
        "If you don't want more babies, you'll need to separate your male and female fry once they reach about 6 to 8 weeks old.",
        "You'll be able to determine the sex of your baby guppies when they're about 1 month old.",
        "Male guppies will have a long, rod-like fin on their underbelly, which is called a gonopodium.",
        "Females will have a dark spot called a gravid spot on their underbelly."
