        "Wrap the clamp meter around the speaker wire in the positive jack.",
        "A clamp meter, or current clamp, is a digital meter with 2 jaws sticking out of the top.",
        "It reads the current (amperage) of any wire running through the opening in the middle of the jaws.",
        "Wrap your clamp meter\u2019s jaws around the output wire that is connecting to your speaker\u2019s positive terminal.Just to clarify, you are not clamping the wire directly.",
        "It simply needs to run through the opening in the middle of the jaws.",
        "Do not pinch the wire with your clamp meter.",
        "If you speaker wire is color-coded, this positive output wire will be red.",
        "Otherwise, look for the wire connecting to the jack labelled positive (+).",
        "Play a 50 Hz test tone through your phone or a CD and turn it up.",
        "Turn the volume on the amplifier, speaker, or receiver all the way down.",
        "Plug a phone or mp3 player into the headphone jack on the front of your amplifier or speaker.",
        "Search online to find a 50 hertz (Hz) test tone.",
        "Press play on your phone or player to begin playing the test tone.",
        "Turn the test tone up as high as you can tolerate and let it continue playing.You cannot perform this test using music because the hertz value and power required to play a song shifts up and down as the sound gets louder and softer.",
        "The 50 hertz test tones are pretty easy to find.",
        "They\u2019re commonly used for this test specifically.",
        "This part of the test is pretty loud and uncomfortable.",
        "Don\u2019t do this late at night when people may be trying to go to sleep.",
        "Read the screens on your meter to find the amplifier\u2019s voltage and amperage.",
        "With the sound playing, check the screen on your multimeter and write the number down.",
        "Then, check the number on the clamp meter and write this number down.",
        "The multimeter\u2019s reading is your amplifier\u2019s voltage, while the clamp meter\u2019s reading is the amperage.As the test tone is playing, your multimeter is registering how much power the amplifier is putting on the current.",
        "The clamp meter is reading how much current there actually is.",
        "Multiply the voltage by the amperage to find the wattage.",
        "Turn the test tone off, shut your amplifier down, and remove your multimeter\u2019s probes.",
        "Then, multiply your voltage and amperage together to find the amplifier\u2019s wattage.",
        "For example, if your voltage was at 108V and the amperage was at 24A, your amplifier\u2019s wattage is 2592 watts.",
        "If you didn\u2019t play the test tone as loud as possible, you aren\u2019t getting the maximum amperage.",
        "The real number is likely a little higher, but it\u2019s not worth damaging your ears to find out.",
        "Compare the amp wattage to your speaker\u2019s wattage.",
        "Use the speaker's wattage restrictions and RMS to determine if the speaker and amplifier can be hooked up together.",
        "If the amplifier's wattage exceeds the speaker's wattage, don't use them together."
