        "Because of the way the peeler shaves the vegetables, the carrot flesh will naturally curl in on itself, so follow the natural curve to make shaping the flower easier.",
        "Stick a toothpick through the bottom of the flower to hold its shape.",
        "After you\u2019ve shaped the carrot shavings into a flower, take a toothpick and push it through the bottom where the ends of the savings overlap.",
        "That will help the flower keep its shape, so you can place it on a plate as a garnish without worrying about it coming undone.",
        "The toothpick should be able to pierce the shaved carrot flesh on its own, but if it doesn\u2019t go through easily, use a knife to create a small hole that you can push the toothpick through."
