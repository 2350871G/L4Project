It\u2019s also possible but not as easy to use a plastic bag that you fill with water. You\u2019ll need a supply of fresh water. The water should be clean, and it\u2019s best to use filtered water if you have it available. Even celery that\u2019s started to wilt can be brought back to life by immersing it in water. Choose celery that has straight and rigid stalks. The leaves should be fresh. You don\u2019t want limp or foul smelling celery."
