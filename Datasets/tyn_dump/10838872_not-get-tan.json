Choose a product that is SPF 30 or higher and that offers protection against both UVA and UVB radiation. Apply it to your face and any other areas of your body that won\u2019t be covered by clothes. Don\u2019t forget your lips! Use a lip balm every day that contains SPF to keep your lips from getting sunburnt. A lot of cosmetic brands offer regular- or tinted-SPF moisturizers that you can use on a daily basis to help protect your skin. These may be better for your skin if you\u2019re prone to acne."
