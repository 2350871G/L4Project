Most of the time, you will need to position your rabbit on its back. To do so, either hold your rabbit belly-up in one arm or sit on the floor with your legs outstretched and lay your bunny belly-up on top of your legs. Make sure you are able to hold your rabbit securely in whichever position you choose. If the soiled area is on your bunny\u2019s back or sides, you can simply lay a towel out on the floor or a large table and sit your rabbit on its feet to clean its fur. Ensure your rabbit\u2019s back is cushioned and its neck and back are supported in whichever position you put it. This will help prevent any injuries."

You may not be able to remove dried-on messes, like mud or your rabbit\u2019s droppings, by spot-cleaning with a baby wipe.

To shave your rabbit, purchase a good pair of clippers that will allow you to have enough control to get into tight spaces. Ask your veterinarian or groomer for recommendations on a good pair of clippers. Go to a professional groomer. Because of the delicate nature of your rabbit\u2019s skin, it might be a good idea to take your bunny to a professional groomer in order to remove any stubborn mats. They will have the right tools and knowledge to get the mats out without cutting or irritating your rabbit\u2019s skin.",

        " Spot-Cleaning Your Rabbit\u2019s Fur Identify any soiled areas.",
        "Spot-cleaning your rabbit is the recommended method for keeping its coat clean.",
        "The first thing you\u2019ll need to do is identify any areas of its coat that are dirty.",
        "In general, a rabbit\u2019s problem areas are their backside, tail, feet, and belly because these are all places they may be unable to reach easily on their own.",
        "Look for dirt, food, and feces stains, as well as wet spots, which are often urine.",
        "Hold your rabbit so its problem areas are easily reached.",
        "Once you have identified any soiled spots on your rabbit\u2019s coat, place your rabbit in a position that is both comfortable for them and that makes it easy for you to reach the soiled areas.",
        "Most of the time, you will need to position your rabbit on its back.",
        "To do so, either hold your rabbit belly-up in one arm or sit on the floor with your legs outstretched and lay your bunny belly-up on top of your legs.",
        "Make sure you are able to hold your rabbit securely in whichever position you choose.",
        "If the soiled area is on your bunny\u2019s back or sides, you can simply lay a towel out on the floor or a large table and sit your rabbit on its feet to clean its fur.",
        "Ensure your rabbit\u2019s back is cushioned and its neck and back are supported in whichever position you put it.",
        "This will help prevent any injuries.",
        "Remove stains with a baby wipe.",
        "Now that you have your rabbit in a position that lets you easily access the stains on its fur, gently rub the fur and skin with a baby wipe to remove any dirt, food, feces, or urine.",
        "After you have targeted all the soiled areas, give your rabbit an all-over wipe-down with a clean wipe.",
        "Look for baby wipes that are fragrance-free, alcohol-free, and hypo-allergenic.",
        "In addition, choose one that contains aloe and Vitamin E.  These will be gentle on your rabbit\u2019s sensitive skin.",
        "Giving Your Rabbit a Dry Bath Apply baby cornstarch powder.",
        "You may not be able to remove dried-on messes, like mud or your rabbit\u2019s droppings, by spot-cleaning with a baby wipe.",
        "Giving your rabbit a dry bath can help take care of these stubborn, dried-on messes.",
        "The first step in giving your rabbit a dry bath is to sprinkle baby cornstarch powder liberally over these areas.",
        "Do not use a baby powder that contains talc, or talcum powder.",
        "This can be harmful to rabbits.",
        "Work the powder around the soiled area.",
        "Use your fingers to work the powder around the soiled area, into the fur and down to the skin.",
        "Coating these messes with powder should allow them to break free from the fur and slide off.",

        "Use your fingers to gently pull down on the dried debris, removing it from your rabbit\u2019s coat.",

        "For especially stubborn messes, use a fine-toothed comb to gently work the debris out of the fur after you\u2019ve applied the cornstarch powder.",
        "To do so, start at the top of the stain (closest to the skin) and lightly tease the dirt away from the skin.",
        "Place your hand on your rabbit\u2019s skin to keep from pulling too hard.",
        "Pat the powdered areas.",

        "Giving Your Rabbit a Butt Bath Fill the sink.",
        "If your bunny is particularly soiled, you can give it a \u201cbutt bath.\u201d  This is a wet bath that focuses mostly on their backside and belly (if needed).",
        "Wet baths can be very stressful for rabbits, however, so do this only in situations where spot-cleaning and a dry bath didn\u2019t work.",
        "First, fill a clean bathroom or kitchen sink with approximately 2 \u00bd inches of warm water.",
        "It may be helpful to use a sink that has a hose attachment for rinsing.",

        "Place your rabbit\u2019s hind legs in the bath.",

        "At this point you can remove your hand from underneath its back legs.",
        "Work shampoo through your rabbit\u2019s fur.",
        "Use one hand to gently rub your bunny\u2019s hind end and belly with the soapy water.",
        "Work the shampoo through its fur and down to the skin.",
        "Do not wet above your rabbits belly unless absolutely necessary, as this will be extra stressful for it.",

        "You can use a fine-toothed comb to separate the fur while you\u2019re drying it to speed up the drying process.",
        "Preventing Tangles and Hairballs Brush your rabbit every two to three days.",
        "Like cats, rabbits lick themselves to self-clean.",
        "However, unlike cats, rabbits cannot vomit so any hairballs your rabbit ingests will stay in its stomach, blocking the stomach exit and causing serious health issues.",
        "Brushing your rabbit regularly can help cut down on the amount of loose fur it ingests, in addition to keeping its fur mat-free.",
        "Short-haired rabbits need to be brushed every three days to prevent hairballs and tangles in their fur.",

        "Brush your rabbit daily when it is shedding.",
        "Rabbits shed approximately every three months.",
        "During this time, you\u2019ll generally need to brush your short-haired rabbit once a day and your long-haired rabbit multiple times a day.",

        "Pay attention to the shedding patterns of your rabbit and adjust how often you brush them accordingly.",

        "Trim your rabbit\u2019s fur as needed.",
        "Short-haired rabbits don\u2019t usually need their fur trimmed, but long-haired rabbits often do.",
        "If you have a long-haired rabbit, it is a good idea to keep its hair trimmed to one inch in length.",
        "This will help prevent mats and cut down on shedding.",
        "Don\u2019t trim the hair around your rabbit\u2019s feet.",

        "You can use either scissors or electric small animal clippers to trim your rabbit\u2019s hair.",
        "Be very careful, however, because rabbits\u2019 skin is very delicate and you can easily cause a serious injury if you cut them with the scissors or clippers.",
        "It is best to have someone help you hold your rabbit still if you choose to trim its fur.",
        "If you are trimming its belly, between its legs, or its backside, have one person hold the rabbit straight up and down with its back pressed against the person\u2019s chest.",
        "They should have one hand placed under the front legs and the other holding the back legs to prevent the rabbit from kicking and hurting itself.",
        "Removing Mats and Tangles Break the mat apart.",
        "If your rabbit has a mat in its fur, you\u2019ll first want to try and work the mat out using  a mat splitter or mat rake.",
        "Use these tools to carefully separate the mat, combing it out a tiny section at a time.",
