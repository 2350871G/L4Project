If creating or using a digital design, you will need to print the design out before you can use it. Print the design on heavy paper for best results. Similarly, if drawing the design by hand, you should sketch it out onto heavy paper instead of sketching it out directly onto your stencil material. The easiest option is to use ready-made stencils, of course, but this option will also provide you with fewer design options."

Pennant felt is one of the best materials to use since it is durable and capable of absorbing excess paint. Cardstock, photo paper, and freezer paper can also be used but may produce messier results. When using ready-made stencils, you can trace the design without taking any additional steps.

Make sure that you choose repositionable or temporary adhesive, though. Do not use permanent adhesive. For best results, allow the spray adhesive to dry for a few minutes before continuing to the next step. Doing so should prevent any residue from sticking to the shirt after you remove the stencil."

When using a dual-action airbrush, you will press the switch down to draw air and pull it back to spray paint. Internal-mix airbrushes introduce the paint directly into the center of the air stream, creating an even spray of paint.

        "Part Three: Airbrush the T-Shirt Set up the t-shirt.",
        "Place a t-shirt board inside of the shirt and set the shirt onto an easel.",
        "The t-shirt board will stretch the material, preventing wrinkles, folds, and dimples from sneaking in and ruining your design.",
        "They also prevent paint from seeping through to the other side of the shirt.",
        "Most t-shirt boards are made of thick cardboard, masonite, or foam board.",
        "The easel should hold the shirt at least 32 inches (81 cm) above the ground.",
        "It must be positioned in a way that allows your hand to move naturally over the shirt as you work.",
        "Hold the airbrush over the shirt.",
        "Position the airbrush over the stencil attached to the shirt.",
        "It is best to start at the edge of the design right than starting at the middle.",
        "The distance between the airbrush and the shirt will create different effects.",
        "For a soft appearance, hold the airbrush roughly 6 inches (15 cm) away from the shirt.",
        "For a harder appearance, hold it roughly 4 inches (10 cm) away from the material.",
        "Spray even, overlapping strokes across the surface.",
        "Gently ease the trigger back to release a stream of paint.",
        "Steadily move your hand over the entire stencil to fill the exposed areas with paint.",
        "When holding the airbrush close to the surface, ease up on the trigger to use less paint.",
        "You need to move your hand steadily across the entire surface as you airbrush the paint onto the material.",
        "Failing to move your hand will cause globs of paint to appear at the beginning and end of each stroke.",
        "Overlapping each pass will prevent gaps of blank space from appearing, creating a more even appearance.",
        "Switch colors as needed.",
        "To switch colors, merely release the trigger to stop the spray, unscrew the old jar, and screw on the new jar.",
        "Some airbrush artists prefer to use a different airbrush for each color, but for bottom-fed airbrushes, you should be able to use the same brush for all colors.",
        "Carefully remove the stencil.",
        "After filling in the stencil portion of the design, carefully peel the stencil straight back to remove it from the shirt.",
        "Remove any tape holding the edges down before lifting away the stencil.",
        "If the stencil resists too much, you may need to wait until the paint dries before peeling it away.",
        "Doing so will minimize the risk of disturbing the paint and ruining the image.",
        "Add freehand designs as desired.",
        "If you want to add freehand elements, now is the time to do so.",
        "Consider the placement carefully since there will be no way to undo any mistakes.",
        "Letters and numbers are the most common freehand elements.",
        "Consider practicing different fonts in advance before attempting to airbrush them onto a shirt.",
        "Part Four: Set the Paint Allow the paint to dry.",
        "Give the paint adequate time to dry before attempting to heat press it.",
        "The exact amount of time will vary by manufacturer, but you should usually let the paint dry for at least 30 minutes.",
        "When you touch the surface of the shirt, you should not pull away any paint and your fingers should not feel tacky.",
        "Protect the t-shirt with parchment paper.",
        "Place the t-shirt on a hard, flat surface and cover the design with a sheet of parchment paper or brown craft paper.",
        "Never apply heat directly to the design since doing so can actually cause the paint to peel away or stick to the iron.",
        "If you don't have parchment paper, turn the t-shirt over and iron the reverse side.",
        "Make sure that the material is flat and smooth before continuing to the next step.",
        "Pass over the design with an iron.",
        "Allow a standard iron to preheat to the \"cotton\" setting, then carefully press the entire design with the hot iron for approximately two minutes.",
        "Heat-treating the airbrushed design should set the paint and prevent it from washing out.",
        "Note that the iron must reach a temperature of at least 300 degrees Fahrenheit (150 degrees Celsius).",
        "Other options for heat setting the design include:\nUsing a professional conveyor set to 120 degrees Fahrenheit (50 degrees Celsius) for 20 minutes.",
        "Using a heat press set to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius) for 30 seconds.",
        "Rotating a heat gun over the surface for 30 seconds.",
        "Launder as usual.",
        "Once the t-shirt cools, you should be able to wash the shirt in cold water using mild detergent.",
        "Tumble dry the shirt on low or allow the material to air dry.",
        "After washing and drying the t-shirt once, the process is complete and the garment is ready to wear."
