For that reason, keep some towels or microfiber cloths on hand so you can dry any iron item as soon as it gets wet. Wiping off the water prevents rust and will keep your iron in good condition. For example, if you ride your bicycle in the rain, dry off the frame once you return home. Be sure to dry off any tools (e.g., a saw, hammer, or screwdriver) and metal furniture that get wet to prevent them from rusting."
