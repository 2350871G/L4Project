        "Planting Your Flowers or Plants Remove your plant or flower from its original pot.",
        "Carefully tip the pot of the plant you\u2019re using in the planter to loosen the soil from the inside of its original pot.",
        "Doing this when your plant\u2019s soil is wet works best because the soil will stay together better.",
        "Remove the entire plant with its roots and soil all together.",
        "Set the whole plant with its original soil into the center of your planter.",
        "You want to try to keep the roots of your plant the way they are as much as possible to avoid damaging them.",
        "Once they\u2019re settled into your planter, they will start to take up more space, but for now, don\u2019t spread them out.",
        "Simply set the whole plant with roots and soil into your new planter.",
        "On the other hand, if the plant appears to be root-bound in its current container, loosen the roots gently outwards with your fingers.",
        "A root-bound plant will have visible roots that coil around the inside of the pot.",
        "Fill the surrounding space with topsoil.",
        "Unless your plant with its original soil is wide enough to fill your tall planter to its edges, you\u2019ll need to fill in the remaining space with topsoil.",
        "Make a nice smooth top  layer of soil at the base of the plant, and give your plant some extra soil around its base if it lost any in the transplant.",
        "Change the topsoil and check on your filler each year.",
        "Many potted plants do well when their soil is changed each year, so they get new nutrients.",
        "You can discard the old soil from your planter into other parts of your garden, and use a new bag of topsoil to replace it.",
        "When you\u2019re replacing the soil, peek down into your bottom filler to see if it needs to be replaced.",
        "Change your bottom filler if you used wood and it\u2019s starting to rot, or become squishy and smelly; and change out aluminum cans if they are starting to rust.",
        "Plastic items and Styrofoam generally last a long time, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to check on them and see if they are breaking down and could be replaced.",
        "Rocks, broken pottery, and clay pebbles will be the materials that last the longest out of your bottom fillers.",
        "Mix in compost or soil amendments instead of replacing your topsoil.",
        "As an alternative to replacing the top soil completely, you can also just mix compost, leaf mold, manure, peat moss, gypsum, or other soil amendments into the soil.",
        "This works best if you originally started with healthy or living soil instead of premixed potting soil.",
        "If you used a mix like Miracle-Gro, it is likelier that you will need to replace the soil every year.",
        "Consider replacing it with living or organic soil."
