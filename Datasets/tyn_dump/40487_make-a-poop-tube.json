                    "description": "To make a poop tube from scratch, get a length of PVC piping at least 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter and 10\u201312 inches (25\u201330 cm) long. Then, get a PVC coupler that is roughly 4.25 inches (10.8 cm) in diameter and 2\u20134 inches (5.1\u201310.2 cm) in length. You\u2019ll also need a 4 in (10 cm) PVC cleanout and plug. Finally, buy a PVC toilet flange that is 4.25 in (10.8 cm) in diameter. Purchase some PVC cement while you\u2019re at the store to make things easy. A PVC pipe is a length of white plastic that doesn\u2019t have any threading on the ends. It is used in water and sewage lines and is typically joined to other pipes using a coupler or adapter. Despite its name, a PVC cleanout and plug is sold as one piece. It has a cap on the end of a threaded material and is usually used to close off plumbing pipes and water lines. The coupler may be labelled as 4 inches (10 cm), but it\u2019s usually around 4.25 inches (10.8 cm) in diameter. Couplers are designed to join PVC pipes of the same size together, thus the difference in the diameter. The same goes for the toilet flange. The toilet flange is a length of PVC used to connect a toilet to a drain line. It has a thread on one end and a cap. Make sure that your toilet flange doesn\u2019t have screw holes in it. The openings have to be embedded in a metal rim around it for this piece to work."

You can use a hammer or the back of a wrench to strike the collar off if you don\u2019t have a mallet."

Then, slide the long tube into the flange so that the 2 layers of cement meet. Push the pieces together so that the top of the flange and the top of the tube are flush. The flange should be on the outside of the tube. This is the bottom of your tube. Twist the cap into the threading at the end of this piece to seal it. If you want to permanently shut this end, add PVC cement to the threading before twisting it closed. Many people prefer to leave an opening at both ends to make cleaning easier, though. Do not use PVC glue instead of PVC cement. While many people think that they\u2019re the same thing, PVC cement actually binds PVC pieces together. Glue simply keeps them in place, which is usually good enough for a closed piping system, but won\u2019t work for a poop tube."
