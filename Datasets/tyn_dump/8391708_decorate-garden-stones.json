        "Paint them white and let them dry.",
        "Doing so once the yellow has dried helps prevent the two colors from mixing accidentally.",
        "Once the white paint dries, proceed to add her lips, inner ear, eyelashes, and pupils, as well as a fine black border around each feature.",
        "Apply sealant.",
        "Protect your artwork from wear, tear, and moisture.",
        "Add or one two coats of sealant.",
        "Be sure to read the directions for the particular sealant you choose, since some may recommend only using outdoors and/or with a ventilator mask in order to prevent inhalation of hazardous fumes.",
        "Once the sealant has dried, feel free to glue any add-ons (like pipe cleaners for whiskers, googly eyes, or bows) to the surface, if desired.",
        "Making Your Own Stones Choose your mold.",
        "Almost any sort of container can be used for this.",
        "Just be sure there aren\u2019t any holes in its bottom or sides so cement doesn\u2019t leak out.",
        "If necessary, trim the sides so they\u2019re only a little higher than the stone you intend to make for easier access to the cement once it\u2019s poured inside.",
        "Possible molds include metal baking pans, plastic bowls, buckets, or containers, or even paper milk cartons cut to size.",
        "Combine cement mix with water.",
        "Depending on how large you wish to make your stone, the amount needed will vary.",
        "However, let\u2019s saying you\u2019re making two stones using a couple of standard-size loaf pans as molds.",
        "For this, measure about 2.5 lbs (0.9 kg) into a plastic bucket.",
        "Then pour 1 cup (237 ml) of water into the mix.",
        "Stir to combine until all of the cement mix has been moistened.",
        "The directions to your particular brand of mix may advise a different ratio.",
        "However, for this project you only need enough water to get all of the cement moist, rather than make a wet soup like you see in the movies.",
        "Fill your mold.",
        "First, spray the inside of your mold with cooking oil to lubricate the sides for easier removal.",
        "Then pour the cement in as evenly as possible.",
        "Once it\u2019s filled, lightly rap the mold\u2019s bottom on a hard surface a couple of times, which will help any trapped reach the surface and escape.",
        "Then smooth the surface with a spade or even just your hand.",
        "Decorate the surface, if desired.",
        "Consider adding other elements in addition to (or instead of) painting your stone.",
        "Set mosaic tiles into the surface immediately after filling the mold, while the cement is still wet.",
        "Wait 30 or 40 minutes after filling, and then use stepping stone stamps to press names, words, or numbers into the cement's surface, like your family name or street number.",
        "Let it dry for a day.",
        "Keep watch over your stone for the first hour after filling the mold.",
        "Pat the surface dry with paper towels if any water is forced to the surface as the cement dries.",
        "After that, simply let it sit for 24 hours.",
        "Then flip the mold upside down over a soft surface and whack the bottom until the stone falls out."
