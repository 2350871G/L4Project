                    "description": "Masonry nails can support furring strips, shelf brackets, or boards up to 1\u00bd\" thick (38mm; the thickness of a 2 x 4). They are built for anchoring into the mortar joints between bricks. Use sleeve anchors instead for heavyweight attachments, or if you need to anchor an object directly into the brick itself. If your wall is a single layer of brick with an exterior surface, the nails could open small cracks in the mortar and allow water to seep through. Use an adhesive or other non-penetrating method instead, or plan to waterproof the exterior."

                    "description": "Masonry nails are made from hardened steel, and usually grooved or threaded. Ordinary nails cannot penetrate into masonry. Choose nails long enough to penetrate about 1\u00bc to 1\u00bd inches (32\u201338mm) into the wall, plus the thickness of the board you are attaching. Cut masonry nails are a variety with flat, tapering sides and a blunt point. These are less likely to split lumber, but are not strictly necessary. Use studs instead when fastening thin metal and plastic, or when supporting a plaque, pipe support, or other object that might need replacement. Studs leave a threaded end protruding from the wall so you can fasten the object with an easily removed nut."

Use the small sledgehammer to drive the nail forcefully into the mortar. Strike the head of the nail squarely and keep the nail at a right angle to the mortar to minimize the chance of breaking. Drive the nail in until the head is flush with the board's surface. Hammer the remaining nails the same way. If you have a big job or find it difficult to drive in the nails with a sledgehammer, get a stud driver instead. Insert the nail in the hollow tube and strike the end of the driver with a hammer. This allows for faster, straighter nailing with less chance of chipping the masonry. You can also drill a hole in the mortar with a masonry bit. Use a bit just smaller than the width of the nails. If the nails are too loose for the holes, just mix then push a little mortar in the hole with your fingers and hammer the nails in. When the mortar dries, the loose nails will take hold."
