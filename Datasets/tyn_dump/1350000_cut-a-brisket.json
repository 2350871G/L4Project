The fat cap is a fat layer that sits on top of the brisket. The point is also called the deckle. This part of the brisket has the most fat on it. It has a marbled look, meaning there are more fat lines running through it. The flat cut is the part of the brisket that has less fat. As you may have guessed, it is also generally flatter than the point."

When buying brisket, aim for 3 to 4 ounces (85 to 113 g) of meat per person. Look for the point cut for a fattier, more flavorful cut that's best for shredding. Look for the flat cut for a leaner meat that's better for slicing. A whole brisket includes both cuts."

Trimming it allows more seasoning to get to your meat, but the fat can provide some flavor. To trim it completely off, work in sections across the meat. Slip your knife under the fat, and slide it back and forth until the section comes off. To trim off part of the fat, just cut the top part of the fat off in the thicker sections.

Place the brisket on a cutting board to study the brisket. The grain is how the strands of muscle run through the meat. It's like a long series of rubber bands, and you'll see the lines in the meat. Check for the grain in 2 directions with a whole brisket. When the brisket is whole, the grain will run in different directions on the flat and point cut.

Slicing the Cooked Brisket Rest the cooked brisket for 20 minutes to 24 hours before slicing it. You should always let your meat rest at least 20 minutes after cooking to keep the juices in the meat. However, if you want very thin slices, wait until the next day when the brisket is cold to cut it. Use a long serrated knife for slicing the brisket. While you can use any sharp knife, a serrated knife (the kind with points along the edge) will work best. The small points help you slice through the brisket. Aim for a knife that is 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 cm) long, which will allow you to slice more of the brisket at once. Use short strokes to go across your brisket against the grain.
