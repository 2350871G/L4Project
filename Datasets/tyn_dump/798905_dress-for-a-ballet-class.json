Footless tights are not usually the best for ballet since ballet shoes can get sweaty and uncomfortable if you\u2019re wearing them over bare feet, so go for footed or convertible styles first. If you are doing pointe work, you will want convertible tights. This will make it easier to put on toe pads if you put them inside your tights."

Leotards come in camisole, tank, halter, short-sleeve, \u00be-sleeve, or full-sleeve styles, so choose the style that is acceptable at your studio and the most comfortable for you. Only wear a full bra under your leotard if you need a high level of support. Leotards will usually come with a shelf-style bra built in. If your leotard doesn't have a shelf bra, wear a discreet sports bra. If you're thinking about wearing a leotard with flashy decorations like sequins, rhinestones, or large bows, it might not be appropriate for the atmosphere of a ballet class."

Only use sheer black ballet skirts for ballet; do not use skater, pleated, or other styles of skirts. Tie a wrap skirt by first holding it behind your back outstretched at waist-level. Fold the left hand over your stomach, and pinch the left ribbon against the skirt with your right hand as you transfer your left hand to the other ribbon. Use your left hand to bring the second ribbon around to the back, and tie the two ribbons in the back with a tight bow."

Use hairspray or small clips if you have any flyaway hairs. If your hair is too short for a bun, clip back any hair that may fall in your face. If you have questions about hair, you can ask your studio's instructor. Bun helpers can help if your hair is layered or difficult to pin. It is a doughnut-shaped piece of mesh that you put your ponytail through and then use pins to secure the hair around the bun helper. Leave the heavy accessories like barrettes, alligator clips, and headbands at home. You need to move quickly when you dance, and metal or plastic can slow you down or go flying across the room, possibly damaging the floor."

Do not, under any circumstances, buy or wear pointe shoes before your director says it\u2019s okay.
