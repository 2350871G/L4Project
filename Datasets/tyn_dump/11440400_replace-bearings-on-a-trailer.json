Take off all the other wheels, 1 at a time, by loosening the lug nuts with your lug wrench, and set them aside. Repeat the process for removing each hub assembly and all of the bearings. Installing New Bearings in the Hubs Wipe off all the old lubricant from the spindle shaft and hub with a rag. Use a spare rag to wipe off as much grease as you can from the outside of the spindle shaft. Do the same for the inside of the hub assembly. Grease gets dirty over time, so it\u2019s important to remove the old grease and relubricate everything with new, clean grease. Clean the spindle shaft and hub assembly with kerosene or solvent. Soak a clean rag in kerosene or grease solvent and wipe the spindle clean. Place the hub in a container and fill it with kerosene or solvent. Let it soak for a few minutes, then use a rag to wipe off the rest of the grease from inside the hub.You can blow-dry the parts with compressed air if you have it available.

Kerosene can cause skin irritation after prolonged contact with skin, so wear a pair of rubber gloves while cleaning to avoid this. You will also need to dispose of dirty kerosene at a hazardous waste collection site. Apply a light coating of grease to the spindle shaft. Stick 2 of your fingers in a bit of new wheel bearing grease and scoop up a small dab of it.

It needs to face the bearing so it holds the grease in. Insert the outer bearing. Flip the hub over so it is face-up on your work surface. Insert the outer bearing small-end-first.Your bearings are now installed and you can put the hubs back on the trailer. Putting the Hubs Back on the Trailer Slide the hub assembly back onto the spindle shaft. Pick up the hub with both hands and hold your thumbs over the outer bearing so it doesn\u2019t fall out. Push the hub all the way back onto the spindle shaft.Warning: Be careful not to hit the seal on the back of the hub when you slide it onto the spindle or you might damage it. The hub will slide on easily as long as you lubricated the spindle shaft enough. If not, then set it down again and apply a little more grease to the shaft. Put the washer and adjusting nut back on. Slide the washer back over the end of the spindle shaft so it covers the outer bearing. Start screwing the adjusting nut back on by hand, then finish tightening it with an adjustable wrench.To make sure the adjusting nut is properly tightened, tighten it all the way once, loosen it a bit, tighten it again, loosen it again, then finally tighten it all the way. Slide a new cotter pin in to lock the nut. Loosen the nut about 1/4 of a turn and slide a new cotter pin through the end of the spindle shaft. Bend the cotter pin with pliers to lock it in place.Keep in mind that once you secure the cotter pin in place, the adjustment nut can\u2019t be turned anymore. Hammer a new dust cap onto the hub. Place the dust cap over the adjustment nut. Tap it with a hammer around the entire perimeter to secure it in place.The dust cap protects the outer bearing and grease from getting and dust and dirt in it. Reattach the wheels to the trailer. Slide the wheels back over the hubs and put the lug nuts back on with your lug wrench. Jack the trailer back down so the wheels are resting on the ground again, then finish tightening the lug nuts.You can now take your trailer for a test drive!",

        "Work your way around the bearing until it falls out underneath the hub.A punch is a metal rod with a sharp tip at 1 end and a blunt end on the other side.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a punch, you can also use a wooden dowel rod as a punch to knock the inner bearing out.",
        "Repeat the process for all the remaining wheels.",
        "Take off all the other wheels, 1 at a time, by loosening the lug nuts with your lug wrench, and set them aside.",
        "Repeat the process for removing each hub assembly and all of the bearings.",
        "Installing New Bearings in the Hubs Wipe off all the old lubricant from the spindle shaft and hub with a rag.",
        "Use a spare rag to wipe off as much grease as you can from the outside of the spindle shaft.",
        "Do the same for the inside of the hub assembly.",
        "Grease gets dirty over time, so it\u2019s important to remove the old grease and relubricate everything with new, clean grease.",
        "Clean the spindle shaft and hub assembly with kerosene or solvent.",
        "Soak a clean rag in kerosene or grease solvent and wipe the spindle clean.",
        "Place the hub in a container and fill it with kerosene or solvent.",
        "Let it soak for a few minutes, then use a rag to wipe off the rest of the grease from inside the hub.You can blow-dry the parts with compressed air if you have it available.",
        "If not, wipe them dry with a clean rag and let them completely air dry before applying new grease.",
        "Kerosene can cause skin irritation after prolonged contact with skin, so wear a pair of rubber gloves while cleaning to avoid this.",
        "You will also need to dispose of dirty kerosene at a hazardous waste collection site.",
        "Apply a light coating of grease to the spindle shaft.",
        "Stick 2 of your fingers in a bit of new wheel bearing grease and scoop up a small dab of it.",
        "Wipe it all over the clean spindle shaft to lightly lubricate it.This will make reassembly easier and also help with cooling.",
        "Pack the new bearings with wheel bearing grease.",
        "Remove your new bearings from their packaging.",
        "Fill the palm of your non-dominant hand with grease.",
        "Pack grease under the balls of the bearings by smashing and scraping the large side of the bearings against the grease in your palm to force it inside until you see grease coming out the small side.Tip: Even when you don\u2019t need to replace your bearings, you should remove them and repack them with new wheel bearing grease once a year.",
        "Trailer bearings are tapered, so 1 side is slightly larger than the other.",
        "Fill the hub with wheel bearing grease.",
        "Scoop some grease up in your hand.",
        "Generously apply it to the entire inside of the hub where the bearings will sit.",
        "You don\u2019t need to put lubricant where the seal will sit on top of the inner bearing.",
        "Place the inner bearing in the hub and put the new seal on.",
        "Put the hub face-down on your work surface and insert the inner bearing small-end-first.",
        "Place the seal on top so the lip is facing the bearing and tap it in gently with a hammer until it is flush.The lip of the seal is the non-metal part of the seal.",
        "It needs to face the bearing so it holds the grease in.",
        "Insert the outer bearing.",
        "Flip the hub over so it is face-up on your work surface.",
        "Insert the outer bearing small-end-first.Your bearings are now installed and you can put the hubs back on the trailer.",
        "Putting the Hubs Back on the Trailer Slide the hub assembly back onto the spindle shaft.",
        "Pick up the hub with both hands and hold your thumbs over the outer bearing so it doesn\u2019t fall out.",
        "Push the hub all the way back onto the spindle shaft.Warning: Be careful not to hit the seal on the back of the hub when you slide it onto the spindle or you might damage it.",
        "The hub will slide on easily as long as you lubricated the spindle shaft enough.",
        "If not, then set it down again and apply a little more grease to the shaft.",
        "Put the washer and adjusting nut back on.",
        "Slide the washer back over the end of the spindle shaft so it covers the outer bearing.",
        "Start screwing the adjusting nut back on by hand, then finish tightening it with an adjustable wrench.To make sure the adjusting nut is properly tightened, tighten it all the way once, loosen it a bit, tighten it again, loosen it again, then finally tighten it all the way.",
        "Slide a new cotter pin in to lock the nut.",
        "Loosen the nut about 1/4 of a turn and slide a new cotter pin through the end of the spindle shaft.",
        "Bend the cotter pin with pliers to lock it in place.Keep in mind that once you secure the cotter pin in place, the adjustment nut can\u2019t be turned anymore.",
        "Hammer a new dust cap onto the hub.",
        "Place the dust cap over the adjustment nut.",
        "Tap it with a hammer around the entire perimeter to secure it in place.The dust cap protects the outer bearing and grease from getting and dust and dirt in it.",
        "Reattach the wheels to the trailer.",
        "Slide the wheels back over the hubs and put the lug nuts back on with your lug wrench.",
        "Jack the trailer back down so the wheels are resting on the ground again, then finish tightening the lug nuts.You can now take your trailer for a test drive!"
