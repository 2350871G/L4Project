Increase your balancing skills by relaxing as much as possible before picking up the spoon. Take a deep breath, shake out your arms, and stretch as needed before picking up the spoon.

Think about how much more smoothly you move when your body isn't tense. Jerking movements are a sure way to end up with an egg on the floor. Your hands, arms, shoulders, neck, and head are the areas to pay the most attention to. Relaxing and stretching your hands and arms usually helps release tension in the other areas.

        "The yolk isn\u2019t perfectly centered in most eggs, so be patient while you search for that sweet spot of balance.",
        "Turn the egg to shift the yolk if you can\u2019t balance it.",
        "If you\u2019re having a hard time standing the egg upright, try rotating it a little with your index fingers.",
        "Sometimes this distributes the yolk\u2019s weight a little more evenly or at least helps you figure out which way to tilt the egg to balance it.",
        "Once the egg feels stable in your fingers, slowly move away from it to see if it remains standing.",
        "Not all eggs are great for balancing.",
        "If you\u2019re having a hard time with one egg, swapping it out for a new one may help.",
        "When the egg is perfectly centered, you feel it with your fingers.",
        "The egg stops tipping to one side.",
        "Your fingers apply an equal amount of pressure to all sides.",
        "Balance the egg on a smooth, flat surface for an additional challenge.",
        "Some people consider rough or uneven surfaces to be cheating.",
        "It does make the egg a little easier to balance, so try moving on to a smooth table or countertop.",
        "Balance it with the same technique you used on the rough surface to impress others with your egg mastery.",
        "Balancing on a smooth surface is a little tougher, especially if you\u2019re using a smooth egg.",
        "Practice often and stay patient to get the hang of it.",
        "Balancing an egg on its smaller end is possible, but it\u2019s even more difficult and time-consuming than the normal way.",
        "Use the same technique, but be prepared for the additional challenge!",
        "Balancing with a Spoon Lay the egg on its side in the spoon.",
        "Ideally, get a spoon that is as big as the egg you plan on using.",
        "Bigger spoons have more surface area to stabilize the egg.",
        "Place the egg in the center, arranging it so the tip points to the front end of the spoon and the wider end faces the spoon's handle.",
        "For a challenge, use increasingly smaller spoons or larger eggs.",
        "Start out with a bigger spoon to practice your balance.",
        "You could also hold the spoon with both hands or with your mouth.",
        "Another option is to try to stand the egg up on the spoon, but keep in mind that balancing it is very difficult if you plan on walking with the spoon in hand.",
        "Prepare for broken eggs!",
        "Loosen your muscles to maintain better control over the egg.",
        "Balancing an egg is both exciting and frustrating, especially when someone challenges you to a race.",
        "Increase your balancing skills by relaxing as much as possible before picking up the spoon.",
        "Take a deep breath, shake out your arms, and stretch as needed before picking up the spoon.",
        "After you pick up the spoon, let your arms and hands hang as low as necessary to reduce the tension in them.",
        "Stay loose as much as possible when you move with the spoon.",
        "Think about how much more smoothly you move when your body isn't tense.",
        "Jerking movements are a sure way to end up with an egg on the floor.",
        "Your hands, arms, shoulders, neck, and head are the areas to pay the most attention to.",
        "Relaxing and stretching your hands and arms usually helps release tension in the other areas.",
        "You can lean forward slightly if it helps you balance, but avoid raising your shoulders or lifting the spoon up toward your face.",
        "Pick the spoon up until it is level with the bottom of your chest.",
        "Most people raise the egg up high and push the spoon out in front of them without realizing that they are throwing off their balance.",
        "To avoid this, get into a strong starting position by standing up straight and holding the spoon out slightly in front of your body.",
        "Make sure the egg isn\u2019t visible on the edge of your vision.",
        "If the egg is visible out of the corner of your eye, you probably will look at it.",
        "As soon as you look, you lose some control over it.",
        "Keep the spoon even with the center of your body so you aren\u2019t tempted to look down.",
        "Adjust your positioning as you move to maintain your balance.",
        "You don\u2019t need to look at the egg to know where it is on the spoon.",
        "As you move, you feel the egg shifting toward the side of the spoon.",
        "Move the spoon in the same direction the egg is moving to bring it back to center.",
        "Also, you could shift your weight or make a quick step in the same direction to help stabilize your own balance.",
        "For example, if you suddenly step on a rock and you feel the egg rolling to the left, move the spoon to the left in a small but smooth motion.",
        "Detecting the egg\u2019s movement is much easier when your muscles are relaxed.",
        "Wearing thin, flexible shoes also help you sense any changes in the ground, such as rocks or slopes, that affect your balance.",
        "Focus ahead of you instead of on the egg.",
        "When you\u2019re running a race, you look at the finish line instead of your feet.",
        "It is no different with a spoon in your hand, whether you\u2019re running a race or not.",
        "Another problem is the temptation to glance at people around you and other distractions.",
        "Focusing is difficult, but look straight ahead to help improve your balance.",
        "Balancing an egg on its side isn\u2019t as hard as it may seem.",
        "Confidence is key, and avoiding distractions is the best way to increase your success in keeping an egg balanced."
