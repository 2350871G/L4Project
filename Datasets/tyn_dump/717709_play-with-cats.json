                    "description": "Get your cat to stalk a rope, a wind-up toy, or a fluffy or feathered toy tied to a string. A piece of string with something fluffy attached to it is one of the simplest toys that you can make, and it is also one of the most effective. Use an old stuffed animal that you don't mind letting a cat chew on. Try to find objects that are smaller than your cat, roughly the size of its natural prey (small birds and rodents). If you don't have a stuffed animal, you can just drag a string around \u2014 there's a good chance that your cat will still try to \"hunt\" the end of the string. It helps when a toy makes some kind of sound to grab your cat's attention, whether it squeaks, rattles, or clicks. Cats have very good hearing, so even a piece of rope sliding over the floor may be enough sound to grab their attention. For cats, playing also functions as training for hunting skills. Play and hunting often go hand-in-hand, and cats will use their claws to bat at anything that holds their attention. It is very easy for a cat to use its imagination, but you need to activate it sometimes. A piece of rope lying limply by itself isn't a prey-like toy. However, when you grab that rope and pull it away from your cat, it will trigger your cat into hunting for its prey."

Make the game difficult, but make it possible to \"win\". The important thing is that you catch your cat's attention with a sudden motion, then keep the toy still enough to give your cat the chance to \"stalk\" its prey. When cats put their nails into something, they don't want to let go. This is where the fun begins. Once they grab their 'prey' it is your job to make the 'prey' to try to escape from his claws by both alternating between gentle and rude pulling on the rope. Make your cat run around! Guide him with the toy. Make the cat use your furniture as an obstacle, and jump in the air as high as possible. Make your cat run in circles. If you practice this kind of play with your cat often enough, the cat might hold onto the piece of string so fiercely that you can drag him around."

        "Be warned that every cat reacts differently to catnip.",
        "Your cat may love it, your cat may indifferent, and your cat may even abuse the stuff.",
        "Give your cat small amounts of catnip, and watch it for cues.",
        "You may also consider buying catnip spray from a pet store and spraying it onto the toys that your cat already has.",
        "Spray the catnip spray onto the toys and wait for it to dry.",
        "Once it has fully dried, slowly bring out the toys.",
        "Use a plastic egg filled with rice.",
        "You can fill a surprise egg or plastic Easter egg with rice and use it to play with your cat.",
        "You can even make a little hole on one end of the egg, and pull a thread through it, and make a knot in the thread.",
        "The sound of the rice shaking may draw your cat's attention, and the string will help you make the egg seem as though it is moving of its own volition.",
        "Brush your cat with an animal brush.",
        "You can brush their chins, their tails and backs, as well as their bellies.",
        "Brush under the tail and on either side, but don't brush your cat's butt.",
        "Test it out on your cat, but be aware that not all cats like being brushed.",
        "Cats may be wary about you touching their bellies.",
        "Don't brush too hard, or else the bristles might hurt your cat.",
        "Giving Your Cat a Box or Bag Let your cat play in a box or a bag.",
        "If you don't have any spare time to play with your cats, a cardboard box or a shopping bag will provide endless entertainment.",
        "Cats might be predators in their natural habitat, but they are not the highest in the food chain, and they love to hide out in small spaces.",
        "A box should be large enough for the cat to climb inside, but not so tall that your cat cannot climb out afterward.",
        "You can set it upright or on its side, as long as the cat can easily access it.",
        "You can use any type of bag that your cat fits inside, but be wary of plastic bags that can trap and suffocate your cat.",
        "In general, paper and canvas bags are safer and more breathe-able.",
        "Set the box or bag out where your cat will find it.",
        "Make sure to use a space in which your cat is comfortable: a living room, a bedroom, or any place where your cat spends much of its time.",
        "Try putting a treat, a toy, or a sprig of catnip into the container to entice your cat inside.",
        "Try putting crinkly, noisy paper into the box to give your cat something to explore.",
        "Let your cat use the box or bag on his own terms.",
        "You can pick the cat up and put him into the box, but do not force him back in if he climbs out.",
        "Avoid tipping the box or bag over while the cat is inside, or else you may give your cat scary associations with the space.",
        "Your cat may spend hours at a time resting in the box, and it may become a place that he associates with safety.",
        "Never make your cat feel as though he is trapped or cornered.",
        "Avoid reaching into the box or looming over the exit, especially if your cat tends to be skittish.",
        "Respect your cat's space.",
        "Some cats love to hide out in cupboards and drawers, under beds and blankets, or perched on the tops of furniture and cat trees.",
        "Your cat may enjoy a box or bag that you set out, but it may revert to its own \"safe spaces\"."
