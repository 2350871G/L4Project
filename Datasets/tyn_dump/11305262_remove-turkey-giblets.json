Check if the turkey is completely thawed by inserting a thermometer into the breast at a few different places. The temperature should be between 32 to 40 \u00b0F (0 to 4 \u00b0C). For example, it will take about 3 days for a 15 lb (6.8 kg) turkey to thaw. You can also thaw it more quickly in ice water. Put the wrapped turkey in a plastic bag and submerge it in a bucket of cold water. Change the cold water every 30 minutes. It will take about 30 minutes per 1 pound (0.45 kg). Don\u2019t leave your turkey to thaw at room temperature."
