                    "description": "For hard plastics that haven\u2019t been painted, fill a bucket with soap and water. Then, dip 150-grit sandpaper into the soapy water and rub the surface in a circular motion. Cover every faded area 5-6 times. Next, grab a sheet of 220-grit sandpaper and repeat the process by rubbing it the same way. Cover every section 5-6 times before rinsing the surface off.Tip: You can continue using a finer grit sandpaper if there are any scratch marks remaining on the plastic. For tough plastics though, 220-grit sandpaper should be fine enough to remove smaller scuff marks from the 150-grit sandpaper. Faded plastic that isn\u2019t discolored is typically caused by oxidization. There are multiple ways to remove oxidization using a variety of different cleaning solutions, so choose the cleaning solution based on the type of plastic that is faded. Hard plastics that can use this method include storage bins, cutting boards, acrylic aquariums, and plastic furniture."

Take your plastic outside and hold the spray bottle 1\u20132 feet (0.30\u20130.61 m) away from the vinyl. Spray it liberally with your vinegar and water and let it sit for 2-3 minutes. Then, rinse the plastic off with cold water and dry it with a cloth or paper towel. If the plastic is still faded, repeat this process. Instead of letting the vinegar and water sit on the plastic though, scrub it into the surface with a clean sponge. Vinyl plastic is commonly used for exterior siding, car mats, computer cases, and gym mats. Do not use this method to clean vinyl records, though."

This is likely to leave brush marks behind, though. You can add multiple layers of paint after letting it dry if you want to deepen or darken the color.
