Crafting a Teacup and Saucer with Gum Paste Roll the gum paste into an \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) circle.

Creating Chocolate Teacups Put 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of chocolate into each cavity of a dome mold. Set a silicone dome mold on your work surface and scoop 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of tempered chocolate into each cavity.Variation: To make dark teacups, use milk or semisweet chocolate. For larger teacups, use a mold with 6 semi-sphere cavities. For standard-sized teacups, choose a mold with 12 to 15 dome cavities.

The chocolate cups should separate from the mold. Set the cups aside while you make the chocolate saucers and handles. Spoon 4 circles of chocolate onto parchment paper and pipe 4 handles. To make the saucers, lay a sheet of parchment paper onto a baking sheet and spread some of the remaining tempered chocolate into 4 even circles on the paper. Each circle should be about 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) in diameter. Then pipe or spoon more chocolate onto the parchment paper to make 4 handle shapes. Each saucer should be about \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) thick. If you don't have parchment paper, use waxed paper instead. Chill the saucers and handles for 10 minutes. Put the baking sheet into the refrigerator and leave the saucers and handles to set. Remove the baking sheet once the chocolate is completely hard. Carefully peel the chocolates off of the sheet so you can assemble the teacups. Attach the handles to the cups and set them on the saucers. To assemble the teacups, dip the ends of the handles into a little of the tempered chocolate. Hold the handles against the sides of the chocolate cups until they stay attached. Then set each teacup onto the chocolate saucers. Work quickly so your hands don't melt the chocolate. If the chocolate teacup pieces begin to soften, put them into the refrigerator for a few minutes.",
