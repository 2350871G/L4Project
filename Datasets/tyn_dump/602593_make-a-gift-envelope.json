It's a good idea to have a few envelopes to open up, in case you rip any when trying to create the template. Draw the outline of the standard envelope onto the cardstock. Do so using a pencil, as you only need to follow the lines and don't want the design marring the end result. Note that for the sake of clear demonstration, this article's example has used a black marker. Remove the template envelope.

This gift wrap will make the envelope's new look, so be sure to choose gift wrap that matches what you'd like for the recipient.
