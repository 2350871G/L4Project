        "As the mixture sits in the fridge, the ingredients will start to come together and thicken.",
        "Whisking the mixture will prevent the ingredients from separating.",
        "For better results, chill your whisk as well.",
        "This will help speed up the overall process and prevent separating.",
        "Whip the mixture with a hand-held mixer until it turns creamy.",
        "Take the bowl out of the fridge and begin to whip the mixture with a hand-held mixer.",
        "Keep mixing until the mixture thickens and starts to form soft peaks.",
        "Make sure that you go all around the edges of the bowl as you mix.",
        "The cream will double in size as you whip it.",
        "How long this takes depends on the temperature of the cream, the speed of your mixer, and your desired consistency.",
        "It shouldn't take more than a few seconds, however.",
        "If you don't have a hand-held mixer, you can use an electric mixer or a food processor fitted with whisks instead.",
        "Store the whipped cream in the fridge for up to 2 days.",
        "A glass jar or bottle with a lid will work the best.",
        "Not only will it help perverse the flavor, but it will be more convenient to use.",
        "Avoid plastic containers, as the chemicals can leach into the cream and affect the flavor.",
        "Although this cream is similar to what you would get with heavy cream, it is not quite the same thing.",
        "It is best used for toppings (i.e.",
        ": waffles, pancakes, strawberries, etc.)",
        "or cake fillings.",
        "Separating Cream from Milk Pour the non-homogenized milk into a glass jar.",
        "You will be sticking a ladle into this jar, so a wide-mouthed jar will be easier to work with than a standard jar with a smaller mouth.",
        "Make sure that the jar is clean.",
        "If your milk is already in a glass jar, you can skip this step.",
        "This method will only work with non-homogenized milk.",
        "It won't work with homogenized milk because homogenized milk doesn't contain any extra cream.",
        "The easiest way to tell if milk is non-homogenized is to check the label when buying it.",
        "If the milk comes in a glass container, you can also look for the cream line.",
        "Let fresh milk rest for 24 hours.",
        "You can use non-homogenized milk from the store, or you can use fresh non-homogenized milk straight from the cow.",
        "If it is the latter, you will need to let the milk sit for at least 24 hours.",
        "Fresh milk has not separated fully.",
        "These 24 hours will give the cream time to rise to the top of the milk.",
        "Find the line where the milk and cream separate.",
        "This is known as the \"cream line.\"",
        "The milk is more translucent than the cream, and lighter in color.",
        "The cream is thicker and more yellowish.",
        "The milk will be towards the bottom of the jar while the cream will be towards the top.",
        "The \"cream line\" won't look like a drawn line, but rather like separated salad dressing, with the liquid on the bottom and the oil on the top.",
        "If you can't find the line, the milk and cream might need more time to separate.",
        "It's also possible that you bought homogenized milk.",
        "Dip a ladle into the cream, above the cream line.",
        "Choose a soup or sauce ladle that is small enough to fit through the mouth of your jar.",
        "Dip it straight into the cream.",
        "Do not dip it so far down so that it reaches the milk, however; you just want to pick up the cream.",
        "If the cream line is too thin for a ladle, use a turkey baster instead.",
        "Scoop the cream out and transfer it into a separate container.",
        "Lift the ladle out of the jar, and transfer the cream into a separate jar.",
        "If you do not have another jar, you can use a bowl or another glass container--as long as it has a lid.",
        "If you are using a turkey baster, be careful not to pick up any milk.",
        "You may not be able to release the bulb all the way.",
        "Repeat the process until you have about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of cream left.",
        "Leaving some cream in the milk jar will reduce the chances of you accidentally getting milk into your cream jar.",
        "The extra cream will also give the milk a better texture, similar to that of whole milk.",
        "If you get milk into the cream, it will mess up any whipped cream or butter that you decide to make with it.",
        "It'll be like getting water into whipped cream or butter.",
        "Use the separated milk and cream as desired.",
        "You can use the milk for cooking and drinking; you can even add it to your cereal or coffee.",
        "The separated cream is ideal for making whipped cream or butter.",
        "Cover both jars with lids and keep them in the fridge.",
        "Use the milk and cream within 1 week."
