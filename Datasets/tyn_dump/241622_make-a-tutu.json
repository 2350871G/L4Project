                    "description": "You will need a lot of tulle to make a tutu, so buying it by the bolt at a fabric store may be your best bet. However, you can also use tulle that is on a 6\u201d spool if desired. The spooled tulle requires less cutting because it is already in the correct width for making a tutu, so you will only need to cut this kind of tulle once to get the right length. If you decide to use tulle that is on a bolt, then you will need about 5 yards (5 m) for a child\u2019s size tutu, 10 yards (9.1 m) for small or medium adult sizes, and about 20 yards (18 m) for large or extra-large adult sizes. If you decide to use tulle that is on a spool, then the amount you will need will depend on the size of the tutu. Tulle spools usually contain about 25 yards (23 m) of tulle. Therefore, 2 or 3 spools of tulle may be enough for  a child\u2019s size tutu, but you may need 4 or 5 spools for an adult\u2019s small or medium tutu, and 7 to 8 spools for a large or extra-large. Buy more tulle than you think you will need to ensure that you have enough."

The 1\u201d (2.5 cm) wide kind is better for child and adult size tutus, and the \u00be\u201d (1.9 cm) size is better for a tutu meant for a baby. To determine how much elastic you will need, measure the person\u2019s waist and buy that amount of elastic. For example, if the person\u2019s waist measures 28\u201d (71 cm), then you would need to buy a 28\u201d (71 cm) strip of elastic. Elastic is often sold in packages that include more elastic than you might need, but you can always cut it to your desired length and keep the extra elastic for another project in the future."

Then, cut your strips or the spooled tulle to the desired length. For example, if you want your tutu to be 18\u201d (46 cm) long, then you would need to cut tulle strips that are 36\u201d (91 cm) long. The finished skirt will be roughly 18\" (46 cm) minus about 1\" (2.5 cm) from attaching the tulle. However, you can always add 1\" (2.5 cm) to your strip length to make up for this loss.

To sew the ends together, thread a needle with about 12\u201d (30 cm) of thread. Then, overlap the ends of your elastic, making sure not to twist the elastic. Sew through the ends several times pulling the thread taut after each stitch.
