During these periods it's not only harder to find food, but they also need more to fuel their bodies. Although October through April is typically the best time, it really depends on your area. In general, a cold but sunny morning is best, especially following an ice storm, which seals away lots of their natural food. Be sure to dress warmly for the weather and be prepared to be patient. Warm socks and winter boots are a must! Take a look at the weekly weather and choose the coldest day to plan your trip. If possible, find a day that is sunnier as opposed to cloudy."
