        "Then, return to your bandsaw or circular saw to trim the corners.",
        "This will leave the blank with a rough octagonal shape.",
        "Measure, mark, and saw the corners carefully to avoid cutting into the body of the ring.",
        "Sand the ring into its finished shape.",
        "Hold the outer edge of the blank lightly against the Dremel tool or belt sander.",
        "Rotate the wood gradually to ensure that the band turns out as even and symmetrical as possible.",
        "Continue sanding down the blank little by little, using the circular outline as a guide.",
        "Be careful not to bear down too hard\u2014remember, you can always sand off more if needed, but you can\u2019t put it back on.",
        "At this stage, you can use your saw to shave some of the excess width off of especially thick blanks to reduce them to a more practical size.",
        "If there's enough extra material, you might even have enough left over to create a pair of matching rings.",
        "Work carefully and be patient.",
        "Shaping is the most time-consuming part of the process, and it may take a little while for you to end up with a ring you\u2019re happy with.",
        "Finishing the Ring Bevel the edges of the ring.",
        "Once you\u2019re satisfied with the basic shape of your ring, tilt it at a 30-45 degree angle and press it gently into the sander or Dremel.",
        "Rotate the ring until you\u2019ve sanded down the entire circumference, then turn it over and smooth the opposite side.",
        "Once again, be careful not to remove too much wood from the edges of the ring.",
        "Doing your sanding by hand will offer you greater control over how much material you\u2019re taking off if you\u2019re concerned about damaging the ring after all the hard work you\u2019ve put into it.",
        "Beveling wears down the squared corners, making the ring more comfortable to slide on and off.",
        "Heat temper the ring to strengthen the wood (optional).",
        "While it\u2019s not a necessity, a few quick passes with a heating gun can provide added durability and a more customized fit.",
        "Set the ring on a heat-safe surface and position the nozzle of the gun 6 inches (15 cm) above it.",
        "Wave the gun back and forth slowly until the wood just begin to smoke or darken around the edges.",
        "Exposure to intense heat will cause the fibers in the wood to draw up, making them stronger.",
        "Apply a coat of oil or wax to preserve the wood finish.",
        "Dab a small amount of beeswax or linseed, walnut, or tung oil onto a clean cloth and rub it over the completed ring inside and out.",
        "Wipe off any excess oil or wax and give the finish a few minutes to dry before trying on your new ring.",
        "Once it\u2019s been treated, you\u2019ll be able to wear it fearlessly in virtually any set of conditions.",
        "Waxes and oils act as a natural buffer against dirt, moisture, and scratches, and will keep your ring from cracking or splitting over time.",
        "No need to worry if you\u2019re unable to track down a fancy finish\u2014the natural oils secreted by your skin will coat the ring with enough wear."
