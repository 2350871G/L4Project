Pick out fabric that matches the color scheme in your bedroom, especially your bed covering and sheets. To make a set of standard pillow cases, you will need 2 yards (1.8 m) of fabric. If you're going to sleep on the pillow cases, be sure to choose a washable fabric. If you're making pillow cases that are more decorative in purpose, the fabric you choose doesn't have to be soft or quite as easily washable.
