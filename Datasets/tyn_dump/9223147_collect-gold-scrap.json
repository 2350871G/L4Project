For every ounce (about 28 g) of scrap gold, you\u2019ll need 30 milliliters (1  fl oz) of nitric acid. Add the acid to the beaker and wait at least 30 minutes to allow the reaction to occur. If you can, wait overnight to allow the harmful fumes to burn off. Nitric acid is extremely corrosive. Exercise extreme caution when handling this material and be sure to wear lab goggles, gloves, and a respirator. You can buy nitric acid online from a lab supply company. Create aqua regia by adding hydrochloric acid. Add hydrochloric acid to the beaker containing the nitric acid and scrap gold. You need about 120 milliliters (4  fl oz) of hydrochloric acid for every ounce (or 28 g) of gold. Wait overnight to allow the aqua regia to completely dissolve the gold. Aqua regia is a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acid that dissolves gold or platinum. Filter the solution to remove solid particles. Carefully pour the liquid out over a dampened coffee filter into a fresh large beaker. Make sure any solid particles remain behind in the filter. These particles will corrupt your gold. This mixture should now be emerald green in color and clear. If it\u2019s murky, refilter it. Boil a mixture of water and urea. Bring one quart (or about a liter) of water to a boil. Add 1 pound (0.45 kg) of powder urea to the water. Slowly add this to the aqua regia solution. Wait for the foam to settle with each new addition of water and urea. Choose a selective precipitant to add to the mixture. Go online to purchase a selective precipitant meant for refining gold. Dissolve one ounce (28 g) of precipitant per ounce of gold in another quart (or liter) of boiling water. Slowly add this to the emerald green mixture. Wear a respirator and keep your face away from the opening of your beaker. Wait about 30 minutes. The green mixture will slowly turn muddy brown. The \u201cmud\u201d is gold particles. There are lots of different brands of selective precipitant. Google \u201cselective precipitant to refine gold for sale\u201d and several options will come up. Any will work! Test the mixture for gold content. Buy a premade precious metal detection liquid online. You\u2019ll use this to check that all the gold has separated from the acid. Dip a glass stirring stick in the acid and put a drop of it on a paper towel. Use a pipette to add a drop of detection liquid to the acid. If the spot turns purple, there\u2019s still dissolved gold in the acid. You want all the gold to become mud and settle at the bottom of the beaker. If there\u2019s still dissolved gold in the liquid, then wait another 30 minutes and test again. If you still get a positive result, add more precipitant and wait again before testing. The purple could be blackish or brownish in color. Filter the acid out into another container. Do not pour off any of the mud. Once you\u2019ve removed the acid, add tap water to your mud and refilter it. It can go in the same container as the acid. Repeat the water rinse three to four times. Then add a small amount of aqua ammonia to rinse the gold. Then filter this out as well. You can buy aqua ammonia online. You\u2019ll need to contact a hazardous disposal contractor to get rid of the acid waste. Pour the liquids into a container, and then label and date it. Go online to find an acceptable disposal center. Use distilled water to gather all the gold particles. Pour a very small amount of distilled water in the beaker containing the gold particles. You can also pour water on the filter to gather any mud that got poured out during the rinsing process. Transfer the distilled water and mud mixture to a new beaker and put it on a hot plate. Then boil off the water and dry out the mud. Melt the dried gold powder. Once your gold mud has dried, it will look like a powder. Put this powder in a clay crucible. Purchase a mold, as you\u2019ll need this to shape your gold once it\u2019s melted. Use a propane torch to turn the powder back into metal. It will melt in a few minutes. Pour the melted gold in the mold and allow it to cool overnight. Be sure to wear flame-resistant gloves, safety goggles, and long pants. Exercise extreme caution and work on a flame-resistant surface. To prevent the powder from blowing around while you\u2019re torching it, consider using a Burno crucible. This jeweler\u2019s tool comes with a small cover. Once you\u2019ve got a pure gold bar, call a few local gold buyers and look online to find the best way to sell your gold.",
