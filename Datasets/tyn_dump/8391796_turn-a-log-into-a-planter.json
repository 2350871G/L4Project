                    "description": "You can make a planter out of any size log that you like. However, keep in mind that larger logs can weigh a great deal, which makes them difficult to move around your yard or deck. In general, try to find a log with a diameter of approximately 12- to 14-inches (30- to 35-cm)\nA log that\u2019s approximately 45-inches (114-cm) long is usually a good size for a planter. You can go smaller or larger, though, depending on how much space you have in your yard and how many flowers you\u2019d like to plant. When it comes to the type of log to use, a harder wood will usually last longer. However, hard woods are more difficult to cut. Maple is a good option."

You can make it almost as long and as wide as the log itself, so nearly the entire top of the log is available for planting. You can also opt for a smaller opening so more of the log is visible. It\u2019s best to use a tape measure when you\u2019re trying to decide how large to make the planter opening. That will help you understand how much space that you have to work with."

You can use a debarking tool, such as a draw knife, to manually remove the bark or a debarker that attaches to the end of a chainsaw and uses a rotating blade to remove the bark much more quickly.

To keep it in place, set a large wooden wedge on either side of the length of the log. Make sure the wedges have a flat edge so they won\u2019t move when you begin to cut. When you\u2019re choosing a location to set the log up for cutting, it\u2019s best to select a spot that\u2019s close to where you plan to put the planter.
