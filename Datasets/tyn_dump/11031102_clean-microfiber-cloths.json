Tip: Always wash microfiber cloths separately from other items. Microfiber cloths are designed to pick up lint and dust. If you wash them with other fabrics, like cotton, they will just accumulate more lint. Hand washing works best for cleaning microfiber cloths that have been used to clean dry messes, such as for dusting. For dirtier cloths or those used to mop up spills, you will need to machine-wash them."
