Applying a small amount of conditioning oil will soften, enrich, and preserve the leather in the pocket of your glove. You can use some shaving cream with lanolin in it as a cheap alternative to conditioning oil. Do not use too much oil or cream on your glove. Applying too much can cause the leather to deteriorate. Use just enough to apply a light coating all over the pocket."

Use just enough to apply a light coating all over the pocket. Use a baseball glove or a softball glove. They're not the same thing. Softball gloves have slightly larger pockets to fit the slightly larger ball. Put a ball in the glove. Put it in the \"sweet spot.\" The sweet spot is where you would ideally catch the ball, in the lower part of the webbing between the thumb and forefinger. Wrap several large rubber bands around the glove with the ball inside. The bands should be tight so that the ball rests snugly in the pocket of the glove and not be able to move around.

Your glove should be ready for action. The more you use it, the more the glove will conform to your hand. Steaming the Glove Apply a conditioning oil to the glove. Coat or spray the entire surface of the glove. You may want to apply a little extra to the laces to make sure they are adequately protected. Let the glove sit for several minutes and soak up the conditioner. Then wipe the glove with a towel until dry. Place the glove on a rack above a pot of water and turn the burner on.

Using Glove Foam Buy a baseball-glove foam treatment from a sporting-goods store. This method is equivalent to breaking in a new glove for six months. Apply the foam and lather it into the glove. Cover the entire surface of the glove. Coat the back of the glove as well. Let the material soak up the lather for several minutes. Place the glove in a 300\u00baF oven for four minutes. Put the foamed glove on a cloth-covered baking sheet. Set it on the top rack of the oven. Set a kitchen timer to make sure you don't leave the glove in too long or forget to take it out. Carefully remove the glove from the oven. Allow it to cool. Wipe away any residue from the treatment. Work the glove repeatedly every which way for ten minutes or more.
