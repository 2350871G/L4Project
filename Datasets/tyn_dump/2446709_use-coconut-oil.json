                    "description": "Since it has a high smoke point and mild flavor, coconut oil is a great choice for a variety of cooking methods. If you\u2019re saut\u00e9ing or pan frying, use an equal amount of coconut oil as whatever other fat the recipe calls for (butter, olive oil, vegetable oil, etc.). To roast vegetables with coconut oil, melt 1-2 tablespoons (15-30 ml) of the oil\u2014or whatever amount your recipe calls for\u2014over low heat in a small saucepan, then drizzle it over your veggies on the roasting pan. Season and roast the vegetables according to your chosen recipe."
