Apply a store-bought deep conditioning product to dampened hair from root to tip until it is fully saturated. Cover your hair with a shower cap and wait 10-30 minutes before rinsing it out. Do this once a week for the best results. Look for hydrating ingredients like Argan oil, aloe vera, vitamin E, and coconut oil.

You can make your own avocado hair mask at home or simply buy a protein treatment at a beauty supply store. Coat your strands with the treatment and leave it on for 10-25 minutes before rinsing it out thoroughly. Hair damage creates gaps in your hair strands. Protein-rich products help to fill in those gaps and restore your hair\u2019s strength."

Damaged ends weigh down your curls and prevent them from bouncing back. Split ends also continue to split if you don\u2019t remove them, eventually making their way up to damage healthy hair. Ask your stylist to take off as much length as they need to in order to get rid of damaged ends. If this will make your hair shorter than you\u2019re comfortable with, trim off as much as possible. Then, continue to get regular trims every 6-8 weeks.Tip: For some people, longer hair styles can weigh down healthy curls. Consider experimenting with a shorter hair style to see if your curls bounce back."
