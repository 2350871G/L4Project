Then, draw a line onto the wax paper going around the outside of the image. Make sure to draw a line that is 0.5 in (1.3 cm) or more past the edges of the image. This will help to ensure that you do not cut through the image. Skip this if you plan to use a solid-colored shirt to make the pillow. Draw the desired pillow shape around the tracing on the wax paper. The tracing may be an irregular shape. If it is, draw a shape around it on the wax paper in the desired shape of your pillow. For example, you could draw a square, circle, triangle, star, hexagon, or other shape that encloses the tracing on the wax paper. Cut the sleeves and side seam of the shirt to create 2 separate pieces. Don\u2019t worry about cutting out your desired shape yet. Use a sharp pair of scissors to cut the sleeves off of the shirt. Then, cut along the side seam and shoulders. This will leave you with 1 front and 1 back piece. Iron the fusible fleece onto the front and back pieces of the t-shirt. Lay the t-shirt pieces so that their right (print or outer) sides are facing down. Then, place a piece of fusible fleece interfacing over each of the pieces. Iron across the surface of the fusible fleece to attach it to the backside of each t-shirt piece. Do not worry if the shirt pieces and fusible fleece are different sizes. Make sure to follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for how long to hold the iron in place and what settings to use. Cut out the t-shirt material and fusible fleece interfacing. Next, turn the t-shirt with fusible fleece backings over so that the shirt sides are facing up. Place the wax pattern piece you created over the front side of your t-shirt. Pin the edges of the wax pattern to make it stay put. Then, cut the t-shirt and fleece along the edges of the pattern piece. Repeat for the other t-shirt and fusible fleece piece. Stack the pieces so the right (print) sides are facing each other. Make sure the edges are lined up all the way around. Insert a pin every 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) along the edges of the pillow. Insert the pins so that they are perpendicular to the edges of the fabric. This will make it easier to remove them as you sew. Sew along the outer edges leaving a 4 in (10 cm) opening. Set your sewing machine to the straight stitch setting. Then, sew a straight stitch 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the raw edges of the 2 pieces. Leave a 4 in (10 cm) section open so that you can invert the pillowcase and insert the stuffing in through this opening. Make sure to remove the pins as you sew.

Be sure to push the stuffing into all corners and edges of the pillow form. This will help to ensure that it is nice and plump! Fold over the raw edges and sew the opening closed. Once your pillow is stuffed, fold over the 0.5 in (1.3 cm) of fabric along the opening of the pillow form. Tuck the fabric inside of the pillow to hide the raw edges. Place a few pins through both sides of the folded over edges to keep them together and temporarily close the opening. Then, sew a straight stitch 0.25 in (0.64 cm) from the pinned edge to secure it. Make sure to remove the pins as you sew or you may damage your sewing machine. Using a Button-Down Shirt Cut off the sleeves and side seams to create a rectangle of fabric. Lay the shirt out flat with the front facing up and the sleeves out to the sides. Cut straight down 1 side of the shirt starting where the sleeve meets the shoulder. Keep cutting down all the way to the bottom of the shirt to remove the sleeve and side seam. Then, repeat on the other side to remove the other sleeve and side seam. If the fabric looks uneven on the sides, trim another 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) off to straighten the edges out. Fold and pin the shoulder seam and collar so they overlap. Lift the shirt up and open up the fabric so that the front and back of the shirt are flat out in 1 long piece with the shoulder seam and collar at the center. Then, pinch the shirt at the shoulder seam and lift the fabric up by about 3 in (7.6 cm). Fold the shoulder seam and collar back so that they overlap with the back portion of the shirt just below the shoulder seam. Make sure that the collar is positioned so that there will be fabric behind it. Otherwise, you will have an opening in the pillow where the collar is. Place a pin going perpendicular to the shoulder seam about every 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm). Sew across the shoulders and around the collar. Next, take the shirt to your sewing machine and set it to the straight stitch setting. Sew 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the shoulder seam and around the bottom of the collar to keep the shirt in this folded position.Warning: Do not sew across the pins! Remove them before you sew over each section or you may damage your sewing machine. Cut off the bottom 3 in (7.6 cm) of fabric on both sides. Leave the shirt open so that the layers are separated. Then, cut a straight line across the bottom of the shirt\u2019s back to remove about 3 in (7.6 cm) of fabric. Repeat this on the front piece to remove the same amount of fabric.
