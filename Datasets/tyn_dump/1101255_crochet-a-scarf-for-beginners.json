Cut the loop in the center, and then pull out the cut yarn attached to the skein (ball of yarn). Then, pull the tail to tighten the knot that this will create. You can also tie a second knot through the last stitch to secure the tail even more. To hide the tail, thread the yarn through the darning or crochet needle and then weave it into the edge of the scarf. When you get close to the end of the tail, tie the yarn through another stitch to secure it and trim off the excess.

Lindsey Campbell\t\t\tWeaving Instructor and Artist\t\t\t\tAdapt your pattern to the size you want your scarf to be. The number of chains you'll need depends on how wide you want the scarf and how thick your yarn is. If you're using a medium-width yarn, each chain will be about 1/4 inch. If you want your scarf to be 5 inches wide, then that would be 20 chains. For a thinner yarn, it might be 1/8 inch wide per chain, so you'd want to double that to 40 chains. If it's a really chunky yarn, you could probably do 10-12 chains.\""
