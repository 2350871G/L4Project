        "Tie the ends of the elastic in place.",
        "The elastic needs to be tight enough to hold the hat to your head, but not so tight that it feels uncomfortable.",
        "Cut two14-inch (35.56 centimeters) long pieces of ribbon or string.",
        "Thread the end of each string through a hole, and tie it in place.",
        "You will tie the loose ends of the ribbon in a bow under your chin when you wear the hat.",
        "Trace a brim onto a sheet of cardstock using a small plate or a compass.",
        "You can use craft foam or poster paper for this as well, but avoid using plain paper or construction paper; it will be too flimsy.",
        "Keep the brim proportionate to the hat.",
        "5\u00bd to 6 inches (13.97 to 15.24 centimeters) will be plenty.",
        "If you are making a pilgrim hat, then the brim can be even smaller.",
        "If you are making a pilgrim hat, choose black paper for the brim.",
        "Trace the top of the cup onto the center of the brim.",
        "Place the cup upside down in the center of the brim you traced.",
        "Use a pencil to trace around the cup, then lift the cup away.",
        "Cut the brim out.",
        "Cut the outer circle first, then the inner circle.",
        "Draw a line of glue just beneath the rolled rim of the cup.",
        "If you look at your paper cup, you'll notice that the rim is rolled under itself.",
        "Draw a thin line of glue right under that rim.",
        "The glue should be in the seam just between the cup and the rolled rim.",
        "Push the brim onto the cup.",
        "Turn the cup upside down so that the bottom is facing you.",
        "Push the paper brim you cut out over the bottom of the cup, down the sides, and onto the glue.",
        "The cup's rolled rim will hold the paper brim in place and keep it from sliding down.",
        "Some of the elastic or ribbon that you threaded through earlier may show.",
        "Don't worry, you can cover it up with the hat band in the next few steps!",
        "Paint the cup, if desired, to match the brim, then wait for it to dry.",
        "If you'd like, you can decorate the hat with glitter, other painted designs, or even stickers.",
        "Be sure to let your designs dry before moving on.",
        "If you are making a pilgrim hat, paint the hat black.",
        "Cut a \u00be-inch (1.91 centimeters) wide strip from craft foam, construction paper, or cardstock.",
        "This will make the band part of the hat.",
        "It is not completely necessary, but it will make your hat look nicer.",
        "If you are making a pilgrim hat, great colors to use would be white or brown.",
        "The strip needs to be wide enough to wrap around the base of your hat.",
        "If you are making just a regular hat, the strip can be any color you want.",
        "Wrap the strip around the base of your hat, and secure it with glue.",
        "Draw a squiggle of glue along the band, then carefully wrap it around the base of your hat.",
        "For a pilgrim look, position it \u00bc in (0.64 centimeters) above the brim.",
        "If you are using craft foam, the band may come apart before the glue dries.",
        "Use a piece of tape to hold the craft foam together until it dries.",
        "Add a buckle, if desired, for a pilgrim hat.",
        "Cut out a 1 by 1-inch (2.54 by 2.54 centimeters) square out of yellow craft foam, construction paper, or cardstock.",
        "Cut a \u00bd to \u00be-inch (1.27 to 1.91 centimeters) square out of the center.",
        "Glue it over the band, right in the center of the hat.",
        "Finished.",
        "Making a Simple Party Top Hat Punch two holes near the top of the cup, as close to the rim as possible.",
        "The holes will be for the string or elastic so that you can wear the hat without it falling off.",
        "The holes need to be facing each other.",
        "You can make them with a hole puncher or a thick needle.",
        "Cut some elastic or ribbon and thread them through the holes.",
        "You can wear the hat in two ways: with an elastic strap under your chin, or by tying two pieces of ribbon under your chin.",
        "Here is what you need to do depending on the method you choose:\nCut a piece of elastic and poke each end through each hole.",
        "Secure the ends with tight knots.",
        "Cut two pieces of 14-inch (35.56 centimeters) long ribbon.",
        "Thread the end of each ribbon through each hole, and tie it in place.",
        "Paint the cup, if desired.",
        "You will be gluing some tinsel to the hat, so keep this in mind.",
        "A glossy black is classic, but you can also paint the hat with glue, then cover it with glitter for something even more blingy.",
        "Decorate the hat, if desired.",
        "Since this will be a wacky party hat, you can go a step further, and decorate it some more.",
        "Add some glittery, sparkly stickers.",
        "If you painted the hat a solid color, you can draw designs on it using glitter glue.",
        "This can make a great New Years hat.",
        "Consider sticking some number stickers onto the front of the hat to honor the new year!",
        "Cut a piece of tinsel.",
        "The tinsel should be wide enough to wrap around the rim of the cup.",
        "The fluffier the tinsel, the better!",
        "Hot glue the tinsel to the rim of the cup.",
        "Draw a line of glue around the cup's rim, then press the tinsel down onto it.",
        "Consider working 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) at a time so that the glue doesn't harden too fast.",
        "Wear the hat.",
        "The tinsel makes it perfect for parties, such as New Years.",
        "Making a Mad Hatter's Top Hat Trace the top of a paper cup onto a sheet of cardstock, then cut the circle out.",
        "This will eventually make the top part of your hat.",
        "Top hats taper, meaning they are wider at the top and narrower towards the brim.",
        "Don't worry about matching the colors; you can always paint the hat at the very end!",
        "Consider trimming the rolled rim of your cup off first.",
        "This way, you won't get a bulky seam where the hat and top join.",
        "Glue the circle to the top of the cup.",
        "Draw a line of hot glue around the top rim of the cup, then quickly push the circle down onto it.",
        "For a neater touch, draw the glue just inside the rim; this way, you won't have to worry about the glue leaking out from under the circle.",
        "If you'd like a fancier hat, cover both the cup and the circle with fabric first.",
        "You can use any type of fabric you like, but stretchy fabric will make it easier.",
        "Tuck any raw edges inside the cup or under the circle.",
        "Trim the bottom part of the cup off so that the hat is more proportionate.",
        "Most paper cups are too tall to be a top hat, even a stylized, mini, \"Mad Hatter's\" top hat.",
        "To make it more realistic, cut the bottom portion of the cup off.",
        "For example, if you are using a 12-ounce (350 milliliters) cup, an 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) off the bottom will be plenty.",
        "For a more authentic look, cut the bottom of the cup at a curve on both sides so that it dips slightly towards the front and back.",
        "Trace a circle onto a sheet of cardstock to make the brim.",
        "You can use a compass or a plate to do this.",
        "Keep the brim proportionate to the cup.",
        "A 5\u00bd to 6 inches (13.97 to 15.24 centimeters) will work great for a 12-ounce (350 milliliters) cup.",
        "Cut the brim out.",
        "If you'd like, you can cut the center of the brim out too; this will help the hat sit better on your head.",
        "Use the bottom of your hat (the cut part of the cup) to trace the circle, then cut it out just a little bit smaller; this will make it easier to glue the hat together.",
        "For a fancier hat, you can cover the brim with fabric as well.",
        "Glue the hat to the brim.",
        "Draw a line of hot glue around the base of the hat, then quickly press the brim down onto it.",
        "If you cut the base of the cup at a curve, make sure that the brim follows the curve; you don't want any gaps.",
        "Hold the brim in place until the glue sets; this should only take a few seconds.",
        "Paint the hat, if desired.",
        "This will blend everything together, and make it look more like a hat, and less like a combination of paper cups and cardstock.",
        "You can use acrylic paint or spray paint.",
        "Let the hat dry before continuing.",
        "If you covered your hat with fabric, then you do not need to paint it.",
        "Wrap a piece of ribbon around the base of the hat to make the band.",
        "Secure the band with some fabric glue.",
        "Measure around the base of the hat, just above the brim, then add \u00bd to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters).",
        "Cut a piece of ribbon to that length, then wrap it around the base of the hat.",
        "Overlap the ends, and secure them with glue.",
        "For a for finished look, tuck the raw edge of the ribbon under before you glue it down.",
        "For a fancier gothic hat, cut a long, narrow strip of tulle or spiderweb lace, and wrap it around the base of the hat.",
        "Tie the tulle/lace in a bow or knot.",
        "Decorate the hat with findings.",
        "A Mad Hatter's top hat is not complete without any added decorations.",
        "You can hot glue all sorts of odd things to the hat band.",
        "To keep your hat from looking too wild, keep all your decorations to one spot, preferably on the side.",
        "Here are some ideas to get you started:\nMini feathers\nFancy beads\nFancy coat buttons\nOld watch gears\nHat pins Hot glue the top hat to a hair comb or headband.",
        "For a more chic look, glue the hat at a slight angle on the headband; this way, it will rest on your head at an angle instead of right on top."
