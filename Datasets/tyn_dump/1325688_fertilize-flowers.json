Determine the best time to fertilize your specific flowering plants. Fertilize the soil for annuals, as well as any new planting, during bed preparation. Fertilize established perennials and ornamental grasses as soon as their growth resumes in the spring. Bulbs need fertilizing as soon as growth appears. Roses need fertilizing beginning in May but not after July. You do not want to encourage new growth as fall and winter approach."
