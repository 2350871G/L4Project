You will remove contaminants and have a layer of seasoning in the smoker. Buy your wood chips or charcoal.

Find a safe place to put your smoker outdoors where it will not be a fire or health risk. You will want it to be outside away from strong winds. Meat Preparation Find a dry rub or marinade recipe for your smoked meat. Mix it up a day before you plan to smoke. Apply the rub or marinade to your meat.  Place the meat in a plastic or glass container. Store it in the refrigerator overnight or for up to 1 day. Smoking Technique Fill your smoker with fuel. This can be charcoal, a propane gas tank or simply the electrical plug. Insert the wood chips, if you are using them. Make sure that you have more nearby to restock the smoking chamber. If you are using a gas smoker, you will want to place the chips inside a foil packet. Poke holes in the top of the packet 6 or more times. Place the packet very close to the heat so that it will produce smoke. If you are using a water smoker, you can place fresh herbs in the water to give the meat extra flavor. Start your fire.

A large pork shoulder can use a higher heat than small pieces of beef jerky. Electric and gas smokers tend to cook hotter, so turn the heat down to a lower setting. Insert the meat on a rack or on multiple smoking racks.  Smoker Timing Check on the meat only 1 to 2 times per smoking session. You will need to check on the fuel and wood chips to replace them. Remember that each time you open the smoker, you will let heat escape. Smoke approximately 1 to 1.5 hours for each lb. (0.45kg) of meat. If you believe your smoker cooks at a hotter temperature, you will want to aim for 1 hour per lb. You can also cook longer at a lower temperature. Rotate the meat every 2 to 3 hours.  Mop some marinade on the meat each time before you turn it.  Check on the meat at least 1 hour before it is scheduled to be done.
