You need a spray bottle that holds at least 16 ounces (473 ml)\nWhile fresh lemon juice is best for the spray, you can use a bottled variety as long as it\u2019s pure juice. Because lemon is so acidic, it can dry out your hair even when it\u2019s diluted with water. If you have dry or damaged hair, add 2 to 3 teaspoons (10 to 15 g) of your conditioner or a hair oil to the lemon mixture for extra hydration."
