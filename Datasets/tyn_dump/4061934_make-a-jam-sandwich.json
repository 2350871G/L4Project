Cut into neat rectangles or finger sticks.  Arrange neatly on a plate or a sandwich/cake stand.  Grilled Jam and Cream Cheese Sandwich Place the slices of sandwich bread on a work surface.

Melt the butter in a frying pan or skillet. Use medium heat. Spread butter over the top of each sandwich.  Put the buttered sandwiches into the frying pan/skillet.
