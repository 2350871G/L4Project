        "If you press too hard during application, you could be rubbing off any polish that has not yet been completely dissolved.",
        "Instead, you want to use the small amount of wax to create a light, smooth coat over the hardened polish.",
        "Do not worry if there is an increase in friction between your finger and your boot along with a matted or cloudy texture.",
        "This only means that the wax is beginning to harden and you will want to continue shaping it into a smooth layer.",
        "If needed, you can add a drop of water to the hardening wax and continue to massage it with light, circular motions.",
        "Continue to add one drop of water at a time until the matted texture disappears.",
        "Allow the wax to dry for at least 10-15 minutes.",
        "Providing the wax the appropriate amount of time to dry will prevent thick layers of wax from building up.",
        "If you don\u2019t allow your wax to dry thoroughly, it will prevent the wax from building a protective layer.",
        "Allowing the wax time to dry is particularly important if you plan to apply another layer.",
        "Reapply the wax until you achieve your desired level of shine.",
        "Even when reapplying the wax, make sure to follow the previous steps exactly.",
        "Applying too much wax will create a hard surface that will not result in a shiny finish.",
        "Be patient during this process.",
        "Depending on the state of your boots, they may take more applications of wax for your desired outcome.",
        "Don\u2019t rush the process, as rushing through the steps will not help you get your desired finish."
