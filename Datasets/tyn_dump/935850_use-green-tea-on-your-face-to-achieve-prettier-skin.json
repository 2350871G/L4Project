Then, remove the water from the heat to use for your tea. The water doesn\u2019t need to be boiling. If it starts to boil, that\u2019s totally okay. However, it will take your tea longer to brew and cool down. Place a green tea bag in a mug. Use an 8 to 12  fl oz (240 to 350 mL) mug to brew the green tea so you have a good batch of toner. Put the bag on the bottom of the mug and drape the string over the side. If you prefer to use loose tea, put about 1-2 tbsp (2-4 g) of tea into a strainer, then put it into the mug.

Then, gently swish your tea bag around in the cup to distribute the green tea. Your water should immediately start to turn a muddy green color. Let your tea steep for about 5-10 minutes. Drape the string on your tea bag or strainer back over the edge of your mug. Then, set a timer for 5-10 minutes and leave your tea to steep. Once the timer goes off, remove the tea bag and either discard it or save the tea leaves for another treatment. You can make a mask using brewed tea leaves. See the recipe below in the section about masks. Wait for the green tea to cool, which takes about 30 minutes. Don\u2019t put hot green tea on your face. Instead, set a timer for 30 minutes and leave the mug to cool. After the timer goes off, test the tea with your fingertips to make sure it\u2019s fully cooled.

You don\u2019t need to brew the tea before you use it. Just cut or tear open a bag of green tea, then pour it into your bowl. You can also use loose green tea. Pour about 1-2 tbsp (2-4 g) of loose green tea into your bowl. Add about 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of a cream facial cleanser to the bowl. You can use any cream facial cleanser with green tea. Use a measuring spoon to measure out the cleanser and add it to your bowl. It\u2019s best to use fragrance free cleanser because the green tea will add a light scent. Stir the green tea into the cleanser until they\u2019re mixed consistently. Use a spoon or your finger to stir the tea and the cleanser to combine them.
