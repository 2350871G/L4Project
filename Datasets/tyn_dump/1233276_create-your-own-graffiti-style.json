        "Use these as a template when practicing.",
        "When a script is mastered, it\u2019ll be less difficult for you to insert single letters from that script into your personal style.",
        "Remember to practice upper and lowercase letters.",
        "Much graffiti is written in all caps, but you never know when you\u2019ll need lowercase letters for stylistic effect.",
        "Use simple scripts as the basis for more complicated designs.",
        "Lightly draw some block letters in pencil on a blank page.",
        "If anything looks off, use a quality eraser to remove whatever doesn't quite work.",
        "In this fashion, redraw and refine your design until you\u2019ve got something you like.",
        "Modify simple scripts to experiment with designs.",
        "Erase some parts of the block letters you drew and add arrows, cracks, bubbles, dents, stars, chips, and whatever else you think might look good.",
        "Try to keep one style per word or sentence.",
        "Mixing up styles can make your graffiti look too busy.",
        "By overlapping one letter with its neighbor, you can give your graffiti the illusion of depth.",
        "The overlapping letter will look like it\u2019s in front of the other one.",
        "It\u2019s very common for graffiti letters to lead into the following letter on the right to create a jigsaw effect where letters are squished together with little to no space in between.",
        "Ink your modified simple script.",
        "When you are done perfecting your block lettering, use a black or blue marker to outline the block letters.",
        "Feel free to add color to the insides of letters with highlighters, Sharpies, crayons, and colored pencils.",
        "Improving Your Style Use a wall in your home for realistic practice.",
        "A blank wall in your home is a great place to practice graffiti.",
        "Try writing the scripts you practiced with spray-paint, paint and paintbrushes, and marker pens.",
        "When the paint dries, you can paint over it with a new design to continue practicing.",
        "If you\u2019re self-conscious about your practice, choose an out-of-sight wall, like one in your basement or behind your house.",
        "If you don't have the option of working directly on a wall, put up some thick paper and practice on that instead.",
        "After practicing like this for a while, thick layers of paint will build up on your wall.",
        "This can negatively impact the quality of your practice.",
        "Remove old paint by sanding it away and keep on practicing.",
        "Learn and practice calligraphy.",
        "Calligraphy is the art of writing decorative letters.",
        "The many unique scripts in calligraphy can also be used in your graffiti.",
        "Calligraphy starter kits can be found at most hobby shops, craft stores, and through online sellers.",
        "Due to the crossover between calligraphy and graffiti, graffiti scripts that are especially ornate are sometimes called \u201ccalligraffiti.\u201d Invent your own unique tag.",
        "A tag is your graffiti signature.",
        "Many graffitists tie major themes in their work together together with their tag.",
        "For example, if peace and harmony are important to you, you might dot i's in your name with peace signs.",
        "Some tags may be unreadable, but a legible tag will help people identify your work more easily.",
        "Tags may change slightly over time, but generally they stay consistent.",
        "Artists with a more surreal style might make it look like the end of their name is melting, similar to the surrealist paintings of Salvador Dali.",
        "Graffitists with an environmental passion could decorate their signature with a leaf stencil overlaid with a few brightly colored stenciled flowers.",
        "Collaborate with other graffiti artists.",
        "Working with another graffiti artist can build up your skills.",
        "Your partner can give you advice or show you techniques to improve your weak areas, and vice versa.",
        "Additionally, you and your partner will likely be able to finish larger pieces in less time, gaining you experience more rapidly.",
        "You might be able to find someone to collaborate with by proposing a project on a Facebook graffiti group wall or a street art website message board.",
        "Make and use stencils.",
        "Stencils aren\u2019t a crutch; many graffiti masters (like Banksy) frequently use stencils in their work.",
        "By layering different colors of paint with stencils, you can create complex designs with a high level of detail.",
        "Hold onto stencils that turned out especially well.",
        "Down the road, if you want to reproduce the design, you won\u2019t have to remake the stencil.",
        "A simple layered design can be made by spraying a leaf and vine stencil with green paint.",
        "Once that dries, spray a simple flower stencil on top to make a blooming vine.",
        "Consistently using a stencil combination that jives with your style can be a great way of gaining recognition and visibility."
