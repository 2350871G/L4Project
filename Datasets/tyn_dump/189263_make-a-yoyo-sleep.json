Loop the string onto your middle finger, about halfway down. Gently toss the yoyo over your hand. If you don't want to buy a bearing-axled yoyo, try customizing a cheap yoyo yourself. The best way to do this is to loosen the string that loops around the center axle of the yoyo. You can also lube the axle. Don't lube ball bearings with any lube, try get some yoyo lube. If you lube the bearing with something like WD-40, it will probably stop working! Throwing the Yoyo Hold the yoyo in a flat palm. Gently twist your palm downward and let the yoyo fall. The yoyo should start to spin once it reaches the end of the string. It should not reel back up the string. Grip the yoyo. Bend your arm backwards\u2014as though you're flexing your biceps\u2014until the yoyo is almost touching your shoulder. Prepare to push the yoyo away from you. Throw the yoyo.
