    "text": " Making the Shape of the Dog Start by grabbing some plastic bags and putting them in one plastic bag to make a nice round oval shape for the head and tape it all up so that it stays there. You can make this any size you want, but it is recommended to make it smaller. Make the body of the dog. Do the same thing with the plastic bags. This time, make result bigger and tape it up so that it stays stiff. Make four tubes using the same technique. This will be the legs. You can even make a tail too! Tape the head, body, legs, and tail together in the correct form of a dog.  Making the Shell Make the paste. The paste is made up of one part water and one part flour. You can start by mixing one cup of flour and one cup of water, continue adding the same proportion if you need more paste. You can add more water if it gets too thick. The paste should have a gluey thickness to it. If the paste appears to be lacking in viscosity, leave it for 5 to 10 minutes and it should thicken up. Rip strips from newspaper about 2.5 inches long or approximately the length of your pinky finger. Make sure that you have a lot of strips. Even if you have more than enough, it is still better than having less. Dip your paper strips into the paste, gently using your fingers to wipe off any excess. Directly apply the soggy strip onto the dog. Continue this until you have one full layer covering the dog. Wait for 12 hours to let it dry.  Add about 2 or 3 more layers and keep waiting until it is dry before continuing. You can choose to add more layers if you think that the shell isn't hard enough. Emptying, Filling, and Decorating Take your knife and cut the dog around the entire outside of the dog's waist. Make sure not to cut through the plastic bags. Pull your pi\u00f1ata ends off the dog. Note! Request adult supervision if necessary. Fill the pi\u00f1ata with candy or whatever filling you have decided to use. Either fill both sides evenly or just fill one side up. Put the 2 ends together and tape it back together firmly.  Decorate your pi\u00f1ata. You could paint it, glue tissue paper to it, or maybe even put glitter on it!",
