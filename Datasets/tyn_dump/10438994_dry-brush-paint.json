Use a feather or lamb\u2019s wool duster to remove any dust and debris from the surface of your furniture. You can also dampen a clean, soft cloth with water and use that to clean your piece. If you opt to use a wet cloth, make sure you dry the piece of furniture with a separate clean, dry cloth before proceeding to paint it. Be sure to only use a clean duster to remove dust and debris from your furniture. Take your duster outside and shake it well to make sure it\u2019s completely clean before using it."
