        "Follow up with rags and wipe away as much grease and grime as you can.",
        "Then, spray a penetrating fluid on each installed glow plug.",
        "Glow plug screw threads often get rusted or \u201cgunked\u201d into place, making them very difficult to remove.",
        "The penetrating fluid helps to loosen the connections.",
        "Penetrating fluid is sold in aerosol spray cans at auto parts retailers.",
        "It\u2019s also called penetrating oil.",
        "Warm up the engine before removing the glow plugs.",
        "For example, plan to remove the old plugs about 30-60 minutes after taking the vehicle for a drive.",
        "Warming up the engine may help to loosen up the screw threads of any glow plugs that are really stuck in place.",
        "Never try to replace the glow plugs while the vehicle is running, and don\u2019t do it right after shutting off the vehicle.",
        "The glow plugs get very hot (it\u2019s their job!)",
        "at startup and present an electric shock hazard while the car batteries are connected.",
        "If you can\u2019t run the vehicle beforehand, plug in the engine block heater for at least 3 hours, then unplug it before removing the old glow plugs.",
        "Disconnect the negative terminals of both vehicle batteries.",
        "Glow plugs connect directly to one or both vehicle batteries, which makes them a shock hazard if the batteries are still connected.",
        "Most diesel vehicles have 2 batteries due to the power needs of the glow plugs, so, assuming your vehicle has 2 batteries, be sure to disconnect them both.",
        "Refer to your user\u2019s manual for specific instructions, but use the following general guidance for each battery:\nPut on work gloves and protective eyewear.",
        "Identify the negative battery terminal, usually indicated by the color black and a minus symbol.",
        "Lift the protective cap (if applicable) over the negative terminal.",
        "Grab your ratchet set and find a socket ring that fits the nut that secures the wire in place.",
        "Loosen the nut a few turns and pull the wire free.",
        "Tuck the wire into a spot where it can\u2019t make contact with the battery.",
        "Pull the electrical connectors from each glow plug head.",
        "In many newer vehicles, the electrical wiring is connected to the head of each glow plug by a push-on plastic connector.",
        "In this case, simply lift the connector completely off of the head of the plug and tuck it out of the way.",
        "Always pull on the connector, never the wire itself.",
        "Alternatively, the wiring may terminate with a metal ring that is secured to the plug head by either a nut or screw.",
        "In this case, find a socket ring that fits the nut and use your ratchet to loosen it, or pick a screwdriver that fits the screw head and loosen it.",
        "Remove and save the nut or screw, lift the wiring free, and tuck it out of the way.",
        "Inspect the wiring and caps of the electrical connectors.",
        "After disconnecting the wiring from the plug heads, take a moment to look over the wires and connectors.",
        "If any part appears frayed, split, or worn out, have it replaced for safety and performance reasons.",
        "This can be a DIY job, but you have to make sure to buy the correct replacement wire/connector and connect it to the battery supply properly.",
        "If you\u2019re not fully confident you can do this, have a mechanic do the job.",
        "Seat the ratchet on each glow plug head and rotate carefully.",
        "Snap the glow plug key (or your best-fit socket ring) to the end of one or more extension rings, depending on how deep into the engine compartment each glow plug head is located.",
        "Seat the key snugly over a glow plug head, then apply just enough counterclockwise force on the ratchet handle to start rotating the glow plug.",
        "After this initial effort, the plug should turn without resistance and be easy to pull out of place by hand.",
        "Do not apply more than moderate force if the glow plug won\u2019t budge.",
        "If you snap off the head of the glow plug, you\u2019ll end up with a costly repair job.",
        "Spray on more penetrating fluid and try again in a few days, or go to a mechanic.",
        "Mechanics often charge $400-$500 USD to replace a full set of glow plugs, but it can easily cost $1000 or more to fix a snapped-off glow plug head.",
        "Pull all the glow plugs to inspect them and test their conductivity.",
        "Once you\u2019ve removed all the glow plugs, look them over for any obvious signs of damage.",
        "Then, test each one with a multimeter.",
        "Set the multimeter to ohms (resistance), and touch the probes to the head of a glow plug and just below its screw threads.",
        "A good glow plug should read between 0.8 and 1.8 ohms, with the lower number being the ideal.",
        "If all the glow plugs are working properly, your engine problems lies elsewhere and should be diagnosed by a mechanic.",
        "In any case, replace all the glow plugs at this point since you\u2019ve already removed them and purchased replacements.",
        "Installing the New Plugs Confirm that the new plugs are precise matches for the old ones.",
        "Hold a new plug next to an old one to make sure they are the same size and shape.",
        "Additionally, check the shaft of each new plug for its listed voltage, which is usually between 1.25 and 2 volts.",
        "If you bought the manufacturer\u2019s recommended replacement, everything should be ready to go!",
        "Plugs that are a different size or shape may not fit into their intended sockets, and may snap if you try to force them in place.",
        "Plugs rated for a different voltage may not last as long or may even prevent a risk to your vehicle\u2019s electrical system.",
        "Apply high-heat anti-seize lubricant to the threads of each new plug.",
        "Anti-seize lubricants usually come in a small can with a brush on the underside of the lid.",
        "Use the brush to add a substantial layer to the threads of each plug right before installing it.",
        "Choose an anti-seize lubricant that\u2019s rated for high-heat applications.",
        "You can find it at auto parts stores, home improvement stores, and online.",
        "The lubricant helps resist corrosion and makes it easier to remove each glow plug in the future.",
        "You\u2019ll be glad you used it when these glow plugs wear out!",
        "Insert each plug and hand-tighten them carefully with your ratchet.",
        "If you can access the intended spot with your hand, use your fingers to seat the plug and turn it clockwise a few times.",
        "Otherwise, nestle the head of the plug into the glow plug key at the end of your ratchet and seat it in its intended spot.",
        "In either case, use the ratchet to slowly tighten the plug until it no longer rotates freely.",
        "Do not over-tighten the glow plugs.",
        "Once you can no longer hand-tighten a plug easily with your ratchet, stop.",
        "Otherwise, you may have a terrible time trying to get the plugs out in the future.",
        "Attach the electrical connectors snugly onto the plug heads.",
        "If your engine has snap-on plastic connectors, simply press each one firmly onto the head of its corresponding glow plug.",
        "Wiggle each connector a little to make sure you have a snug attachment.",
        "If the wires are instead connected by nuts or screws, place the metal ring at the end of each wire over the head of its corresponding glow plug.",
        "Then, use the nuts or screws that you saved from before (or, if available, new ones that came with the new glow plugs) to secure the wire in place.",
        "Hand-tighten the nuts (with a ratchet) or screws (with a screwdriver) to a snug fit, but no further.",
        "Connect the battery terminals and test the new glow plugs.",
        "Refer to your owner\u2019s manual for specific instructions and follow the reverse of the disconnection procedure.",
        "For example: put on your work gloves and safety eyewear, lay each wire end over its corresponding negative battery terminal, hand-tighten (but don\u2019t over-tighten) the nuts that secure the wires in place with a ratchet, snap the protective caps in place (if applicable), and start the engine as normal.",
        "With new glow plugs, your diesel engine should start up much more smoothly.",
        "If it doesn\u2019t, schedule an appointment with a mechanic."
