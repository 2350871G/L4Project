Fold the scarf in half so that it looks like a triangle. Tie the two tail ends around your waist and tie the two layers of the top point around your neck. Alternatively, wear it as a sleeveless top. Fold two opposite corners of the scarf to the scarf's center. Tie the scarf around yourself, keeping the folded edges at the top and bottom."
