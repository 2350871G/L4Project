            "description": "Whistles are available in all the major keys. The most common, a D whistle, can play in the keys of D and G major. The second most common, a C whistle, can play in the keys of C and F major. The lowest note of a penny whistle, with all the fingers covered, is called the tonic - on a D whistle the tonic is D.\nThe tone of the tin whistle is largely determined by its manufacturing. Clarke style rolled metal whistles tend to have a smooth soft sound, while Generation style cylindrical instruments tend to have louder or shrill whistle sounds. Inexpensive rolled metal whistles, such as those from Cooperman Fife and Drum (which also produces high-end instruments) may be very airy in sound, and may be difficult to play in the upper register (second octave). Often placing a piece of tape over one edge of the fipple slot (just below the mouthpiece) to narrow the fipple will improve the instrument's tone and playability significantly. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/7\\/72\\/Tinwhistles-6848.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/7\\/72\\/Tinwhistles-6848.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":685,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":1132.4,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>Image from: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/commons.wikimedia.org\\/wiki\\/Image:Tinwhistles.jpg\\\">Wikimedia Commons<\\/a><br>License: <a href=\\\"\\/wikiHow:GNU-Free-Documentation-License\\\" title=\\\"wikiHow:GNU Free Documentation License\\\">GNU Free Documentation<\\/a><br><br>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}  Whistles are pitched in different keys and octaves.

The term soprano whistle is sometimes used for the higher-pitched whistles when it is necessary to distinguish them from low whistles."

        "Thus a D whistle is fairly apt for playing both G and A, and a C instrument can be used fairly easily for F and G.\nTo play a C natural on a D whistle or a B flat on a C whistle you can either half cover the top hole of the whistle or cover the two holes below the top hole.",
