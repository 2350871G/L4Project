With your dominant hand, cut about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the bottom of the stem, separating the leaves. Soak the leaves in water. Place the collard greens in a large bowl and cover them with warm water. Add a little salt to the water. Salt is abrasive and helps in the process of scrubbing away dirt and impurities. Gently scrub the leaves with your hands and rinse. Cut out the spine from each leaf. Lay each leaf out flat on the counter. Use a sharp knife to cut along the spine on each side, separating the leaf into two parts and completely removing the spine. Stack the leaves so the flat, cut sides all line up. Roll the stack of leaves lengthwise. You may need to form several stacks to get tight rolls. Cut the greens into ribbons. Slice each roll into 1 inch (2.5 cm) pieces. Separate the pieces with your fingers, letting them unravel into long strips. Saut\u00e9ed Heat the oil in a large, heavy skillet. Use medium-high heat, and continue heating 1 tbsp. of olive oil until the oil easily glides over the entire bottom of the pan. Cook the minced garlic. Add 2 tbsp. of minced garlic to the hot oil and move it around with a spatula, keeping it moving to prevent it from burning. Continue cooking for about 20 seconds, until the garlic begins to change in color to a deeper yellow or light tan. Add the strips of collard greens. It is better to add all the greens at once than to do so in batches to ensure that all the greens get the same amount of heat, oil, and garlic. Add the strips and stir with your spatula, making sure that all the greens are coated in oil. Sprinkle the greens with spicy peppers and salt. Add 1/2 tsp. of crushed red pepper or jalape\u00f1os and 1/4 tsp. of salt to the collard greens. Wait approximately 30 seconds and toss the greens again with your spatula to mix the seasonings into the rest of the greens. Mix thoroughly, moving the top to the bottom and the greens on the bottom to the top, several times, to ensure the greens are evenly mixed. Continue cooking and stirring over medium-high heat. Use your spatula and continue tossing the shreds of collard greens. Do not let it sit for long without movement. Moving the greens around is the only way to ensure the greens are evenly heated and evenly cooked. Stop cooking once the leaves are slightly wilted. The greens should still be bright green, however. Turn off the stove and remove the pan from the heating element. Add one tbsp of vinegar. Red wine vinegar or cider vinegar would also work if you do not have balsamic vinegar available. Drizzle the vinegar over the greens and toss again to coat. Serve hot. The greens can also be enjoyed at room temperature. Fried Place the collard green leaves in a pot. The stems should already be removed from the bunches and the spines should be removed from the leaves. Cover the greens with cold water for 3-5 minutes. Allow them to soak fully. Dissolve 1 tbsp. of table salt in the water. Stir it in well. Drain the leaves and remove them from the sink.  Wash the collard greens at least two more times. Repeating this process twice will fully clean the collard greens. Fry 5 slices of bacon in a pot over medium heat. Fry the bacon until it is nice and crisp. Then, remove the cooked bacon, crumble it, and set it aside, leaving the bacon drippings in the pot. Add the drained collard greens to the bacon drippings and fry it. Fry the collards for several minutes, allowing them to wilt and absorb the bacon grease. Then, cover the pot with a lid. Add 3/4 - 1 cup of water to the pot. Stir the ingredients as you continue to steam the collard greens. Add the salt, sugar, and bouillon cube to the pot. Add 1 tsp. of table salt, 3 tbsp. of granulated sugar, and 1 chicken bullion cube to the pot for flavor. Reduce the heat and cover the pot and cook for 10-15 minutes. Cook the pot with the collard greens over low heat until the greens are tender and dark green. Drain the liquid.  Serve. When the greens are ready, chop them finely using two sharp knives, and sprinkle them with the crumbled bacon. Pour 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar over the greens and enjoy them while they are hot.
