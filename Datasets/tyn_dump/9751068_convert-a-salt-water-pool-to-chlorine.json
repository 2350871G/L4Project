        "Most chlorine tablets include cyanuric acid, so adding them now could end up damaging the pool by making the water too acidic.",
        "Acid eats away at the pipes and pool liner.",
        "The pH and other chemicals should still be at safe levels.",
        "If you are concerned about them, keep everyone out of the pool until you finish converting it.",
        "Fill a floating container with chlorine tablets and place it in the water.",
        "Purchase chlorine tablets from a pool supply store along with a plastic floating container.",
        "Once the pool\u2019s acid level is around 30 ppm or lower, add the tablets to the container according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.",
        "Push the container below the water\u2019s surface, then let it float so the tablets dissolve.",
        "The number of chlorine tablets you need depends on the size of your pool.",
        "Add 1 tablet for every 5,000 US gal (19,000 L) of water your pool holds.",
        "You may also purchase a chlorinator.",
        "It attaches to the pool\u2019s pipes and automatically disperses any chlorine you place inside it.",
        "Avoid adding the tablets directly to the pool.",
        "They can damage the pool\u2019s pipes and liner.",
        "Maintaining the Pool Test the pool water at least once a week.",
        "Continue using your pool testing kit.",
        "Collect a new sample to perform a fresh test every time.",
        "With chlorine pools, you have to test the water every week in order to monitor and adjust the chemical levels.",
        "When converting your pool, it can be helpful to test the water every couple of days until the chemical levels stabilize.",
        "The ideal pool pH level is between 7.2 and 7.8.",
        "Keep the chlorine level  between 1 and 3 ppm.",
        "Make sure the cyanuric acid level is between 20 and 30 ppm.",
        "Refill the floating container after the chlorine tablets dissolve.",
        "You will usually need to add a couple of tablets every week.",
        "Check the container daily to see how many tablets are left.",
        "Add more as needed to keep your water sterilized.",
        "The chlorine level should stay between 1 and 3 ppm.",
        "Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.",
        "Avoid using more than the recommended number of tablets.",
        "Add shock to the pool once a week to sterilize the water.",
        "Purchase a bag of non-chlorinated shock from a pool supply store.",
        "In a well-ventilated area, mix the shock into a bucket of pool water.",
        "Add about 1 lb (0.45 kg) of shock for every 10,000 US gal (38,000 L) your pool holds.",
        "Non-chlorinated shock is the best choice since it won\u2019t raise your pool\u2019s cyanuric acid level, which may be high after switching from salt water.",
        "Adjust the pH level with muriatic acid.",
        "Salt water pools tend to have a high pH level.",
        "To bring your pool\u2019s pH down after converting it to chlorine, get muriatic acid from a pool supply store.",
        "You will need to add \u20444 US gal (0.95 L), possibly more for pools that hold more than 10,000 US gal (38,000 L) of water.",
        "Pour it into the water according to the instructions on the label.",
        "The pH level should read between 7.2 and 7.8 on your testing kit.",
        "Avoid using soda ash or baking soda.",
        "These products raise the pH.",
        "They are only useful later on if you lower the pH too much.",
        "Mix and add the chemicals to the water separately.",
        "Mix the chemicals 1 at a time, all in separate buckets.",
        "Read the manufacturer\u2019s instructions to figure out what ratio of chemical product and pool water to mix.",
        "Then, dump the chemical directly into the pool to disperse.",
        "Wash out the buckets after using them.",
        "Use an online tool such as http://www.poolcalculator.com to figure the amount of chemicals to add.",
        "Run the pool\u2019s pump for at least 30 minutes after adding chemicals.",
        "The pump keeps the water moving in your pool, which helps disperse the chemicals.",
        "After you are done adding your chemicals and tablets, turn the pump on.",
        "Let it run for at least half an hour before getting into the water."
