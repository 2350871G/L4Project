Cleaning the Enclosure While the Snake Is Soaking Get rid of all food and water within the enclosure. While the snake is soaking, begin cleaning the enclosure. Pour the water out and discard any uneaten or leftover food. Clean out the food and water containers thoroughly. Food and water must be disposed of to prevent it from being contaminated with cleaning chemicals. You only need to clean the enclosure once to remove the mites, not every day. Dispose of all of the substrate and porous items in the enclosure. Take all of the substrate and porous items out of the enclosure. Place these into a plastic garbage bag and keep it outside until it can be discarded. Make sure it is out of reach from pets. Wood is a porous item that cannot be cleaned adequately and must be removed. Vacuum the inside of the enclosure thoroughly. Vacuum the floors and wall of the enclosure.
