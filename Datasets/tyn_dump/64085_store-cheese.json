Gently unwrap the piece of cheese and take it out of the packaging to store it. Smell or taste your cheese. If there\u2019s a chemical flavor, use a knife to scrape off a thin top layer around the whole piece of cheese. That will remove the area of the cheese that\u2019s been affected by the plastic packaging. If you bought cheese from a deli or cheesemonger and it\u2019s already wrapped in wax paper or cheese paper, skip this step."
