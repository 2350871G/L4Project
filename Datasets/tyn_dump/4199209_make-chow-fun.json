Cut each strip crosswise into 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) slices. Marinate the beef. In a large bowl, whisk together the cornstarch, half the soy sauce, and the sesame oil. Add the beef, then stir well until all the meat is coated. Set the meat aside for 10 to 20 minutes. Separate the noodles. Use your hands to separate the noodles into strips. If necessary, cut the noodles into 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) pieces. Note that the noodles may break into shorter pieces as you separate them. Use actual chow fun noodles if possible.

The skillet is hot enough when you can add a bead of water to it and watch it evaporate withing 1 to 2 seconds. Stir-fry the aromatics. Place the ginger, garlic, and crushed sections of the green onion in the hot oil. Cook, stirring constantly, for 15 seconds or until the aroma gets drawn out. Once ready, carefully push the aromatics to one side of the pan. Cook the beef. Add the beef to the pan in a flat layer. Sear it without stirring for 1 minute. Add the bean sauce.
