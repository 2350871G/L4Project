                    "headline": "Identify how much connecting pipe is needed.",
                    "description": "Pipe is needed to connect the cylinder to a pump head and the plunger to a handle at the surface. The amount of pipe depends on the depth of the static water level in the well. From the top of the cylinder, you can reduce the pipe down to a 1-1/4in diameter pipe to save on cost and weight. However, it does increase the force required to pull the water to the surface (hydraulic principles). Before measuring the static water depth and well depth, first remove the well cap. This will reveal a secondary cap and the electrical connections. This cap is cemented to a pipe which connects to the pitless adapter (the device that holds the pump in place and connects the water from the pump to the line leading to the house below the frost level). You do not need to remove this cap or lift the pump at this time, as you only need to measure the static water depth. To measure the static water depth, tie a weight to some string or light rope. It is difficult to hear or see when the weight enters the water. Therefore, lower the weight down a few feet and bring it back up, feeling for water on the rope. Continue lowering the rope a couple feet further each time, until the rope comes up wet. Each time, mark the rope at the top of the well before pulling the rope out. Measure the distance from the weight to highest mark on the rope. This is the static water depth. Measuring the total depth of the well is more of a challenge because it is difficult to know when you hit bottom (or the top of the pump). Using fishing line may be helpful. Nevertheless, the static water depth is the important measurement. This indicates how much pipe (both the 1-1/4in outer pipe and the 1/2in inner pipe) is needed. To cover the 15 feet (4.6 m), and have the cylinder well below the static water level, use 20 feet (6.1 m) of pipe. The pipe will be connected with threaded couplers to aid in assembly and disassembly without cement. One additional detail to mention here is to drill a small hole in the side of the 1-1/4in pipe a few feet below the ground level. This will slowly drain water from the top of the pipe back into the well and thus prevent freeze damage."

        "Be aware that you may prefer the original design for the following reasons: You may not want the water coming out of the handle.",
        "You might plan to use a lever handle (which pulls the water up when you push down on the handle).",
        "The force of pushing down on the 1/2in pipe to do the work may lead to buckling issues.",
        "The water in the pipe must still be pulled up to the surface with the alternative design.",
        "The alternative assumes the cylinder above the plunger is dry.",
        "There is a good chance the gasket will not form a perfect seal and leak water into the chamber anyway.",
        "It is not as easy to drain water from the internal pipe to prevent freeze damage.",
        "Make alternative pipe configuration.",
        "Another alternative design uses a rigid pusher rod rather than the 1/2in pipe (which could also be employed in the original design above) and a separate supply pipe to the surface.",
        "This design uses more materials, may not fit in most wells, and the pump head may be more complicated.",
        "This option operates just like the previous one.",
        "The only difference is the water pipe and pusher rod are separated."
