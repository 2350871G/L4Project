Apply fertilizer in the beginning and middle of the growing season. You can either use liquid fertilizer or buy granules that soak into the soil. Apply half of the fertilizer amount on the soil near your plants and spread it evenly throughout the garden bed. Immediately water the soil so the fertilizer can soak in and give nutrients to your plants. Be careful not to get any fertilizer directly on your plants since you could damage them. Pull weeds out by hand when you see them growing. Check your garden beds weekly for weeds growing between your plants. Grab the weeds as close to the soil as you can and pull them straight out of the ground. If you don\u2019t want to pull them by hand, use a hoe or trowel to dig out the roots and remove them from your garden. Avoid leaving the weed\u2019s roots in the soil since they could grow back.Warning: Avoid using chemical weed killers since they could also harm or kill other plants you have in your garden. Prune plants to control their sizes. Begin pruning at the start of the season to help promote new growth, and in the middle of the season to help keep your garden looking clean. Remove any stems or branches that have damage or look leggy with a pair of hand pruners. Make cuts at a 45-degree angle to help reduce the chance of rot. Don\u2019t cut off any more than a third of the vegetation, or else the plant may not grow back as easily.",

        " Choosing the Best Location Choose an area that gets 6\u20138 hours of sun daily.",
        "Since most flowering plants and vegetables require full sun to grow properly, opt for the sunniest area in your yard to place your garden.",
        "If the area doesn\u2019t get a lot of light during the day, you may still be able to grow plants that thrive in the shade.",

        "Double-check your measurements to make sure they\u2019re accurate so you can plan the space efficiently.",
        "Typically, plots grow best in rectangular areas, but you can make your garden a different shape, such as a triangle or circle, if it fits the space better.Tip: Put wooden stakes around the perimeter of the area and stretch twine between them to help you visualize the size of the space better.",
        "Following Design Principles Plan the layout for your garden to scale on a piece of graph paper.",
        "Draw the outline on the paper so each grid square equals \u20442 or 1 square foot (0.046 or 0.093 m).",

        "Make a list of the plants you want to grow and label each square on the grid with one of the plants from your list.",
        "Make sure you know the final growing sizes so you can easily manage how many plants of a species you\u2019ll be able to grow in the square.",
        "Typically, you can fit 1\u20132 individual plants of a species in 1 square foot (0.093 m) area, but you may be able to plant more if they\u2019re small growths.",
        "Talk to an employee at a gardening center since they can help you choose plants that will work the best.",
        "Arrange your design so there are focal points.",
        "Aim to have 1\u20132 aspects of your garden design unique so they stand out from the rest of your plants.",

        "Put similar plants across from one another to create rhythm and symmetry.",
        "Rather than putting different plants in each of your garden beds, opt for using the same plant or ones that have similar textures or colors so they\u2019re across from one another.",
