This is not an opportunity to vent your frustrations or demonize the other parent. Journal entries that are obviously emotional will be less useful in a legal setting. If you feel like you need to work through your emotions by writing them down, try keeping a completely separate journal or diary. That way you can express yourself without compromising your custody journal. An example of appropriate objective writing is: \u201cJohn picked up our child at 4:00. The scheduled pick-up time was 3:00.\u201d An inappropriate account of the same event would say something like: \u201cJohn was late again today, like usual.
