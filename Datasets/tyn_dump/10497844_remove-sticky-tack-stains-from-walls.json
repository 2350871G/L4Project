Repeat this process as needed. Rubbing on Dish Detergent Pour a pea-sized amount of dishwashing detergent onto a scrub brush. Take a bottle of dishwashing gel and pour a tiny amount on top of a bristled scrubbing brush. This brush can be large or small, as long as you can comfortably rub it over the stained area.
