It doesn't matter which foot is in front. Once you've positioned your feet, you'll need to take two steps forward -- the first with your kicking foot, the second with your other foot -- so that you've gained some momentum while keeping your kicking foot behind your other foot. Your forward steps should be smooth and controlled. Don't walk or run toward the ball; instead, approach it at a fast pace. Take two normal-sized steps. Taking stutter steps or long strides will make it more difficult for you to punt the ball."

Kick your foot straight up so that it hits the ball dead on, instead of kicking it across your body, as many people have a tendency to do. Your toes should be pointed forward and you should kick the ball with the top of your kicking foot. Move your dominant hand away to the side, and lift your other hand in the air to help you follow through and gain momentum. You should make contact at the height of your knee."
