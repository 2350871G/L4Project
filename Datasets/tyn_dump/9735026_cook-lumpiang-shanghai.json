Mix the ingredients together thoroughly. It would be best to use your hands, but you can use a wooden spoon or spatula too. You can use just 1 type of meat. For example, you can use 2 pounds (900 g) of ground pork or 2 pounds (900 g) of ground beef. If you have a different filling that you'd like to use, feel free to do so."
