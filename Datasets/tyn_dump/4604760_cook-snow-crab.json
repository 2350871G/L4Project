Bring the water to a boil. Put the live crabs directly in the boiling water and submerge them. Put the lid on the pot and turn the heat down to medium. Cook for 15 minutes. Prepare the crabs. After you are done boiling the crabs, take them out of the water. They should be bright orange. Rinse the crabs under cold water. Take apart the crab with your hands. Keep rinsing the crab while removing the apron of the crab. Grab each side of the crab and crack it in half down the middle of the body. Remove the mouth, lungs, and any extra parts from each side of the crab. Remove the legs from the shell. Do all of this while still rinsing the crab. Cooking Frozen Snow Crab Legs Boil the legs for moist meat. Fill a large pot with to 2/3 full of cold tap water and bring to a boil. Add crab legs to the water, bending to cover as much as possible with water. Cook uncovered for 4-5 minutes, occasionally adjusting with tongs to evenly heat.
