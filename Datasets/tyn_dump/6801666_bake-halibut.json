        "Place one halibut fillet on the center of one parchment paper square.",
        "Repeat this with the other fillets and other pieces of parchment.",
        "If you don't have enough space on your kitchen counter to spread out all four sheets of parchment, simply create one packet at a time, setting the remaining fillets and parchment aside until you're ready to use them.",
        "When using skin-on fillets, you'll need to arrange the skin-side of each one face-down so the exposed flesh faces up.",
        "The placement of the fillets won't matter when using skinless halibut, though.",
        "Season with salt and pepper.",
        "Evenly sprinkle each fillet with salt and pepper.",
        "Arrange the aromatics on top.",
        "Lay the slices of citrus fruit over each fillet, followed by the thyme sprigs and sliced onion.",
        "Spread these aromatics evenly over the top of the halibut.",
        "While lemon is the most conventional citrus pairing for fish, orange slices also work well for this recipe.",
        "Baked halibut recipes using aromatic ingredients typically do best when you use the parchment baking method.",
        "The packets of paper trap the fragrant aromas in the air directly surrounding the fish, concentrating their flavor as a result.",
        "Fold the parchment paper into packets.",
        "Fold up the sides of the each piece of parchment over the top of each fillet, sealing the edges.",
        "Begin by folding lengthwise over the fillets.",
        "Overlap the folds and crease well to hold them.",
        "Fold and roll each open end of the parchment, then tuck the ends beneath the packet to prevent them from coming undone.",
        "Place each packet onto the prepared baking sheet when finished.",
        "Bake for 15 minutes.",
        "Place the halibut packets in the preheat oven and bake them until the center of the thickest fillet flakes easily when pierced with a fork.",
        "Since you'll have to undo the packet to test the fish, it's best to wait until you're relatively certain the fish is done.",
        "Only undo and test one packet.",
        "If it isn't done, fold the sides again and continue baking as need.",
        "Serve.",
        "Remove the finished halibut packets from the oven and enjoy them immediately.",
        "You can either undo the packets and serve the fish on individual serving platters or allow each person to cut open his or her own packet.",
        "Breaded Baked Halibut Preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (230 degrees Celsius).",
        "Prepare a 9-inch by 13-inch (23-cm by 33-cm) baking sheet by lightly coating it with nonstick cooking spray.",
        "For an easier cleanup, you could cover the baking sheet with nonstick aluminum foil or parchment paper instead of using cooking spray.",
        "Toss together the flour, salt, and pepper.",
        "Place the three ingredients in a medium mixing bowl and thoroughly toss them together using a fork or whisk.",
        "You don't need to sift the flour, but if you notice any lumps, break them up with the utensil while mixing the ingredients.",
        "The flour will make it easier for the outer coatings to adhere to the halibut.",
        "Adding the salt and pepper to the flour will allow them to flavor the flesh of the halibut more directly.",
        "Beat together the egg and milk.",
        "Combine the two ingredients together in a second medium bowl.",
        "Whisk them together until evenly combined.",
        "The egg and milk will help keep the halibut moist while also making it easier for the final coating to stick to the fish.",
        "Combine the breading ingredients.",
        "In another separate medium bowl, combine the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and garlic powder, tossing them together until evenly combined.",
        "Arrange the three bowls side-by-side.",
        "The flour mixture should be first, the egg mixture should be second, and the bread crumb mixture should be third.",
        "Dredge the halibut in flour.",
        "Working one at a time, place each halibut fillet in the flour mixture, turning as needed and lightly coating all sides.",
        "Finish coating each fillet with all three layers before starting on the next one.",
        "After coating the halibut with flour, hold it above the flour dish and give the fillet a gentle tap to dust off any excess flour.",
        "Dip the halibut in the egg mixture.",
        "Dunk the halibut fillet in the egg mixture, turning as needed to coat all sides.",
        "When finished, hold the fillet over the egg bowl for a few seconds to allow the excess egg a chance to drip off.",
        "Coat the halibut with bread crumbs.",
        "Toss the halibut into the bread crumb mixture, turning as needed to coat all sides.",
        "You may need to use your hands to gently press the crumb coating onto the sides of the fish.",
        "As soon as you finish coating the fish with this last layer, place it onto your prepared baking sheet.",
        "Bake for 15 minutes.",
        "Place the coated halibut in the preheated oven and cook for about 15 minutes, or until the center flakes apart easily when pierced with a fork.",
        "If you'd like the halibut to develop a golden-brown coating, consider spraying the top of each coated fillet with a little oil-based cooking spray before placing the fish in the oven.",
        "Note that you do not need to rotate or flip the fish as it bakes.",
        "Serve.",
        "Remove the finished halibut from the oven and enjoy it immediately."
