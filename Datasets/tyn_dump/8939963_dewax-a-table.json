Once you're done rinsing off your table, you can use another clean rag or paper towels to thoroughly dry your table. If you notice there is still a wax finish, repeat the process until you remove it. Using Mineral Spirits Douse a rag in mineral spirits. You can purchase mineral spirits online or at most hardware stores. Wear gloves and work in a well-ventilated area when working with mineral spirits. Carefully pour some of the mineral spirits onto your rag.

Use a dull instrument like a credit card so that you don't chip or scratch the surface of your table. Push the credit card under the wax and try to work it off the table.
