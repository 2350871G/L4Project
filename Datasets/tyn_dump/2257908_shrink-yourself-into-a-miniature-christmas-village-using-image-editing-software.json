Save the two layers as separate PSD files. Use the clone tool to disguise anything you don't want seen in the photo or video. Cut out parts of the picture you want to be in front of the subject. Create two layers of video. One must contain what you want to become primary in the video, and the other to be alternate and less seen by the viewer. Save the portion of the picture that would stand in front of the videoed person in a transparent format."
