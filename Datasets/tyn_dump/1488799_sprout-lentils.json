Place them in a sieve or fine-holed colander and wash under running water. Remove any debris. Soaking the lentils Place the lentils into a large, clean jar. Fill the jar with lukewarm water. Cover the jar. Cover the top of the jar with muslin or cheesecloth. Secure it in place using a rubber band or tightly tied twine. Absolutely do not cover the jar with the solid lid. Soak the lentils. Leave the jar in a warm place, overnight. The lentils must soak for at least 8 hours.

Remove any lentils that haven't germinated (begun to sprout) and return the sprouts to the jar to keep growing. Use when they have sprouted enough.
