Each mantra has different vibrations and you want to find one that corresponds to your intention. Repetition of mantras can help you disconnect from any thoughts that arise during meditation and also help keep you focused on your intention. There are many different mantras from which you can choose. The following are a few examples of powerful mantras that you can chant. Om or aum is the most basic and powerful mantra you can chant. This universal mantra will create powerful, positive vibrations in your lower abdomen. It is often combined with the mantra \u201cShanti,\u201d which means peace in Sanskrit. You can repeat aum as many times as you wish for your chanting. Maha mantra, which is also called either the great mantra or Hare Krishna mantra, can help you achieve salvation and peace of mind. Repeat the entire mantra as many times as you like. It\u2019s words are: Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Lokah samastah sukhino bhavantu is a mantra of cooperation and compassion and means \u201cMay all beings everywhere be happy and free, and may the thoughts, words, and actions of my own life contribute in some way to that happiness and to that freedom for all.\u201d Repeat this mantra three or more times. Om namah shivaya is a mantra that reminds every person of her own divinity and encourages self-confidence and compassion. It means \u201cI bow to Shiva, the supreme deity of transformation who represents the truest, highest self.\u201d Repeat the mantra three or more times."
