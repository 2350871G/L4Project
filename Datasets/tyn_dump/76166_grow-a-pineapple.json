Make sure the pineapple isn't underripe. It needs to be ripe in order to produce another pineapple. Check to make sure the pineapple isn't too ripe by tugging a little at the leaves.

The skin on the fruit should be golden brown and firm to the touch.

While some people prefer to soak the pineapple crown first, it is not necessary. Soaking the Pineapple Crown Fill a large glass with water. The mouth of the glass should be large enough to fit the pineapple crown inside, but small enough so that you can prop it up to keep it from getting completely submerged. Stick a few toothpicks into the pineapple crown. Place them across from each other near the top of the stem. Push them in just far enough so that they'll stay in place. These toothpicks are used to suspend the pineapple crown in the glass of water. Put the crown in the water. The toothpicks should rest on the rim of the glass. The stem should be submerged in the water, and the leaves should stick out the top. Place the glass in a sunny window and wait for the roots to sprout. It should take several days or up to a few weeks for white roots to poke out and begin to grow. Keep the plant away from extreme temperatures. Don't let it get too hot or too cold. Change out the water every few days to prevent the growth of mold. Planting the Pineapple Crown Prepare a pot of soil for the crown. Fill a 6-inch pot with light garden soil that has a 30% blend of organic matter. This has the right blend of nutrients for the pineapple plant. Plant the pineapple crown in the pot. Plant the crown when the roots are a few inches long. Wait until they've gotten long enough to take root in soil. If you plant the crown too early it won't do well. As you plant it, make sure that the base of any remaining leaves are just above soil level. Press the soil firmly around the base of the crown without  getting any soil on the leaves. Keep the plant moist and warm. It needs a sunny, warm and humid environment where the night temperatures won't drop below 65\u00baF (18\u00baC). If conditions are dry, mist the plant regularly.
