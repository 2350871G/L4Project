You can also add designs using stencils, acrylic paint, and a foam brush instead. Keep the finished height of your planter in mind. You will be rolling the top down! Fold or roll the top edge of the bag down. Keep folding or rolling until the bag is the right height for your plant. How thick you make the rolled or folded band depends on the size of the bag.
