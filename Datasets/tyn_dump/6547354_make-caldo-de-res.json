Beef shank and beef short ribs are both good options, but you can use nearly any bone-in cut of meat. You need to use the bones in the soup, even if you completely remove the beef from the bones while cutting it. The bone marrow helps flavor the broth."

If you opt to use zucchini instead of chayote, make the piece slightly larger since zucchini is softer and cooks faster. Cut the head of cabbage in half, then cut each half into three equal portions.
