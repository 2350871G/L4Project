    "text": " Making a Basic Cotton Cloud Cut four equal strands of thin wire with wire cutters. How long the wires are will depend on how big you want your cloud to be. You will be folding these wires into a ring, so keep this in mind. Make sure that all of the wires are approximately the same length. Twist the wires into rings. Take your first wire, and overlap the two ends by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Twist the ends to hold the ring together. Repeat this step for the other wires. Tuck the first ring into the second one, crosswise. Hold one wire horizontally. Hold the other ring above it, vertically. Slight the vertical ring into the horizontal one halfway. Your two rings will make a cross. Secure the cross with glue or wire. You can secure the crossed wires together by putting beads of hot glue on the joints between the two rings. You can also tie the joints together with some more wire. Be sure to tuck any sharp ends into the wire \"orb.\" Add the other two rings to form an X and complete your frame. Slip the third ring over your frame at a left angle. Secure it to the joints between the other rings with hot glue or more wire. Repeat this step with the fourth ring, but insert it at a right angle. These two new rings should form an X. Hot glue polyester stuffing to the wire frame. Pull off a long strip of polyester stuffing. Draw a squiggle of hot glue across it, then wrap it over your frame.

Get some tape and tape your hanging cloud to the ceiling. For a stronger hold, screw a ceiling hook into your ceiling. Tie a loop into the end of the fishing line. Slip the loop over the ceiling hook. Making a Lighted Cloud Open up a white paper lantern. If you'd like a larger cloud, hot glue one or two smaller paper lanterns to a larger one. Hot glue a clump of polyester stuffing to the lantern. Pick off a large, cotton candy-sized lump of polyester stuffing. Draw a swirl of hot glue on the clump, then press the stuffing against the lantern. Continue hot gluing clumps to the lantern. Alternate between large, small, and medium-sized clumps.

Making 3D Paper Clouds Draw a basic cloud shape on thick cardboard. Use a pencil or marker to draw a simple cloud shape onto thick cardboard. This will serve as your template.

Cut just inside the drawn line so that your shapes won't have any visible pencil marks around the edges. Lightly erase any pencil marks that accidentally make it onto the final shapes.

Then, draw a thin line of hot glue directly down the center of one of the cloud shapes. Place a length of fishing line directly into the glue.

Fold another cloud shape right down the center. Set the glued cloud aside for a moment. Take another white cloud shape and fold it in half horizontally. The crease should appear in the same place as the glue stripe on the first cloud -- right down the middle. Place the folded edge into the hot glue.
