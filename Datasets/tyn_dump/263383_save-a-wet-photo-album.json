The water runs down on the page (hang them from a corner, one clip only) toward the point, and keeps the paper from warping as the water's weight allows the top part to dry first, keeping downward pressure on the drying paper. If you can't hang them, they will dry fine on an absorbent material such as a kitchen or paper towel, although they may be more prone to buckling here and there (harmless). Do not blot as it could damage the surface."
