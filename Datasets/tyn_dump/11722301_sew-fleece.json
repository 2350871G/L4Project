        "Sewing too quickly may result in mistakes, such as bunched up fabric or thread.",
        "Instead, sew the fabric using a very light touch, at least at first.",
        "As you get more comfortable sewing fleece, you can increase your pressure on the pedal and sew faster.Tip: You can also test a few stitch by turning the wheel on the right side of the sewing machine.",
        "This will manually move the needle up and down to stitch the fabric.",
        "Turn the wheel 4-6 times to create a few stitches and see how it looks before continuing.",
        "Hold the fabric taut as you sew.",
        "Pull the edges of the fabric gently in front of and behind the sewing machine.",
        "Don\u2019t stretch the fabric, but keep it taut enough so that it doesn\u2019t bunch up under your sewing machine.If you notice this happening, stop sewing and readjust the fabric.",
        "Trim the edges with pinking shears to prevent fraying.",
        "Pinking shears are fabric scissors with jagged edges.",
        "Use a pair of pinking shears to cut in a straight line about \u20444 in (0.64 cm) from the seam after sewing a fleece garment.",
        "Be very careful not to cut through the seam itself.Most fleece fabric is not prone to fraying, but trimming the edges with pinking shears before you sew will help to ensure that it doesn\u2019t fray.",
        "You can also add a stay stitch to prevent fraying along the edges, such as by sewing a zigzag stitch along the edge of a fleece item."
