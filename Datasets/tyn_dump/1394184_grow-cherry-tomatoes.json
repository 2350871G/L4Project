You can purchase seedlings or tomato plants from a farmer\u2019s market or nursery. Seeds can be purchased from a nursery or seed catalogue, and there are several types of seeds to choose from. A few varieties of cherry tomatoes are:\nThe Sungold plant. This type of cherry tomato grows large and is typically the first to produce fruit. It is a delicious choice. The Sun Sugar variety. The Sun Sugar variety is very much like the Sungold plant, but the skin does not crack as easily. The Chadwick and Fox are heirloom varieties that grow very fast and have a tangy flavor. The Sweet Treats variety has a deep red color, sweet taste, and it is resistant to many diseases."

You can use either a tomato cage or wooden stakes. For a tomato cage, you should purchase a large tomato cage from a nursery or home improvement store. You should buy the largest metal cage you can find. Wooden stakes can also be found at nurseries or home improvement stores. You will need to tie the vine around the stake as it grows. Cages do not require as much tying. Do not use a plastic or vinyl cage. It is toxic to plants and can expose them to lead. Keeping the plants off of the ground promotes air circulation for cleaner and healthier fruit. You can also use cages and stakes together. The stakes should be placed in the center of the cages. It is important to find a large metal cage because the vines grow quickly and may outgrow a smaller cage quickly."

The soil should be made of different sized crumbs. It shouldn\u2019t be powdery or clumpy. Check for living organisms. Healthy soil will have living things like insects, worms, centipedes, spiders, and others. Watch for about 4 minutes and count \u2013 less then 10 organisms and your soil may not be ideal.

        "Make sure the pot has drainage.",
        "If planting in a pot, it needs to have holes in the bottom for drainage.",
        "If it does not, drill \u00bc to \u00bd holes every few inches around the bottom edge and a few holes in the center as well.",
        "Planting in a garden may need a little preparation before planting, given the results of your soil test.",
        "If you plan to keep the container inside or on a balcony, you will probably want to put a saucer underneath it so that the drainage doesn\u2019t run everywhere.",
        "You can find a saucer at a nursery, home improvement store, and some supermarkets.",
        "If using a garden, be sure you choose a consistently sunny place.",
        "It also won\u2019t hurt to add some compost to the soil before planting.",
        "Put the cage into the planter.",
        "This step is only if you will be using a cage in a container.",
        "If using a stake or planting outside, you will not need to put them into position until you\u2019ve planted.",
        "Do not put the potting mix into the bucket before inserting the cage.",
        "Instead, put the pointy end of the cage into the pot and then fill in the potting mix.",
        "Fill in the potting mix.",
        "Pour the potting mix into the container.",
        "Water the mix until it is evenly moist.",
        "Then, fill in more mix until it comes \u00bd inch below the rim of the container.",
        "The surface of the soil should be even.",
        "You can use a cup or watering can to water the mix.",
        "Dig a small hole into the mix or soil.",
        "You should dig a small hole into the center of the soil if planting in a container.",
        "If planting multiple plants in a garden, you will need to dig holes two feet apart from each other.",
        "Put the plants into the small holes.",
        "Planting from seedling requires inserting it deep enough in the hole so that only four or five leaves are left showing once the hole is covered.",
        "The hole only needs to be a few inches deep.",
        "Cover the hole.",
        "Use the soil that you removed to fill in the hole.",
        "The seedling should only be showing about four leaves.",
        "Make sure the surface of the soil is even when you have finished covering.",
        "Place the cage in the garden.",
        "Put the point end of the cage around the area where you planted.",
        "The seedlings should be in the middle of the cage.",
        "If using  stakes, you can wait to put in the stakes until the seeds have sprouted into seedlings.",
        "Put the stakes three inches from the seedling.",
        "Use a hammer to secure the stake into the ground.",
        "Waiting until the plant is larger to cage or stake may result in a damaged plant.",
        "Maintaining the Plant Water the plant regularly.",
        "You should water the plants every two or three days.",
        "The soil should be moist at all times.",
        "If at any point it does feel dry, water the soil or mix until it is moist again.",
        "The soil should seem saturated, but not drowning in water.",
        "Fertilize once a week.",
        "The fertilizer gives the plants the nutrition to grow and thrive.",
        "Essentially, it acts as food.",
        "Use an organic fertilizer once a week.",
        "To use the fertilizer, work it into the first few inches of soil with your fingers or a plastic fork.",
        "Make sure the fertilizer stays a few inches away from the stem.",
        "A few well known brands of organic fertilizer for tomatoes are Gardener\u2019s Supply, Tomato-tone, and Burpee Organic Tomato Fertilizer.",
        "Directions vary according to the product.",
        "Follow the directions on the label when applying fertilizer.",
        "Organic fertilizers release nutrients slower than chemical fertilizers.",
        "Using a chemical fertilizer risks burning the roots, though they are often cheaper.",
        "Prune when needed.",
        "Once the plant has grown larger, you will need to prune every so often.",
        "Prune when sprouts and branches start to grow off of the central stem, and when leaves look dry or dead.",
        "Use small pruners or scissors.",
        "You should also push back any branches that poke out of the holes of the tomato cage.",
        "The plant will drop if you do not.",
        "Avoid pests and diseases.",
        "Cherry tomato plants do get pests, but fungus is often a larger problem.",
        "Symptoms of a fungus problems include yellowing leaves, moldy blotches, and dark spots.",
        "Stems may be affected as well.",
        "Pick the leaves off and spray your plant with fungicide immediately if you notice any of these symptoms.",
        "Potato beetles and stink bugs are common pests.",
        "Pick them off or use a natural insect spray to repel them.",
        "Plant Doctor, Daconil, and Garden Safe are a few brands of fungicide.",
        "EcoSmart and Safer are a couple of brands of organic pesticide.",
        "Fungus that spreads throughout the entire plant can most likely not be saved.",
        "To avoid infections, try watering your plants in the morning directly into the soil.",
        "Watering leaves, especially later in the day, encourages fungal growth.",
        "Fungus can survive in soil for years.",
        "Remove the cherry tomato plants from the soil if fungus is a recurring problem.",
        "Plant a different type of plant or flower in that area.",
        "Harvest after about six to eight weeks.",
        "A seedling will begin to flower in about a month.",
        "If you used seeds, you should add about two weeks to that amount of time.",
        "Flowers will turn into small, green fruits.",
        "Ripe and ready to pick cherry tomatoes will be ready a few weeks after that.",
        "The tomatoes should come off of the stems easily.",
        "Do not pull or twist the vine to pick a tomato.",
        "Pick individual fruits off of the vine every day.",
        "The plant should continue to produce tomatoes until the first frost.",
        "Freshly picked tomatoes should be stored at room temperature; they will rot if refrigerated.",
        "They can also be canned or dried."
