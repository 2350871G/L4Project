Brush the boots from the top to the bottom using downward brush strokes. This helps to soften the wool and loosen any dirt that is trapped inside the wool. Suede brushes and products are gentle, making them ideal for sheepskin boots. Purchase a suede brush from a shoe shop. Dampen the outside of the boots with a wet sponge.
