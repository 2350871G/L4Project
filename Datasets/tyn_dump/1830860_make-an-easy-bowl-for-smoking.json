The classic choice is the apple, but you can use a pear, squash, melon, or other solid fruit. Keep in mind that the fruit that you choose to use will influence the flavor of your smoke. Any fruit that can be peeled by hand, like a banana or orange, won\u2019t make for the best bowl. Their insides tend to be too soft to make a bowl. People gravitate towards using apples as pipes because they tend to have the lowest influence on the smoke flavor-wise and are easy to work with. You shouldn\u2019t eat the fruit after you\u2019re done smoking out of it because you may swallow smoke or butane residue. Swallowing burnt tobacco is also quite bad for your stomach."

        "This will function as your bowl.",
        "A 7/32 socket will fit perfectly over a standard pen.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a clean, unfinished socket, you can use the metal tip of a pen by flipping it around upside down into the opening of your pen case.",
        "Fill the socket with tobacco and put a finger on the carb hole to smoke.",
        "Pack some tobacco into the socket.",
        "Pat it down a little and tilt the bottle up to your lips.",
        "Take the cap off of the bottle if you haven\u2019t already and put your lips around it.",
        "Light the bowl with a lighter while your finger sits over the carb hole and inhale a little.",
        "Remove your finger from the carb hole after you\u2019re done lighting the tobacco and inhale deeply to bring the smoke into your lungs.",
        "You can reuse the water bottle 2-3 times if you want, but the flavor of the tobacco will begin to taste  kind of funny after more than a few uses.",
        "You may have some tobacco fall through into the water bottle.",
        "This isn\u2019t a big deal though, and it won\u2019t really affect the smoking process."
