Make sure that you will be comfortable by using a yoga mat. You may also place a folded up blanket under your knees if you need some extra padding for your knees. Make sure your hands are directly beneath your shoulders and your knees directly beneath your hips. The tops of your feet can either be flat on the floor or you can curl your toes if you choose. Inhale and exhale evenly through your nose. If you can, make a slight sound like the sea when you breathe. This is called ujayyi breathing and can help you flow through your routine more effectively."
