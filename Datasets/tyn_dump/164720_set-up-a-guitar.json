The bridge elongates or shortens the length of your strings. If it\u2019s not adjusted correctly, notes down the neck of the guitar will be flat or sharp. Strum the top string next to the tuner and adjust the tuning knobs until it\u2019s an E. Put the rest of the guitar in standard E, A, D, G, B, E tuning.

If the note is flat, or lower than an E, you\u2019ll need to elongate the string. Rotate the screws on the back of the bridge counterclockwise one full rotation to shorten the string. Check the note on the string when holding down the 12th fret. Turn on the tuner and hold down the 12th fret on the string that you just adjusted. Look at the note that is displayed on the tuner. If the note is still off when you hold down the 12th fret, you\u2019ll need to make additional adjustments to the bridge until the note is the same note as the string when played in the open position. Repeat the process on the 5 remaining strings. Continue the same process on the rest of the strings, making sure that the 12th fret note and the open note are the same. Adjust all of the strings on the bridge so that the notes are the same. The second string from the top of the neck should be an A, the third string from the top should D, and so on. Setting up the Pickups Hold down the fret closest to the pickups on the top string. The frets are the square spaces on your neck and the pickups are the rectangular studded pieces where you strum. Hold down the fret that\u2019s closest to the pickups on the top string, or 6th string, so that you can determine whether your strings are the correct distance from your pickups. If your strings are too close to your pickups, it could create feedback or unwanted gain. If the strings are too far from the pickups, you may not get the full sound from your guitar. Measure the distance between the pickup and the string. Hold the end of a ruler flat against the top of the pickups while continuing to hold down the fret.

If the distance is already \u204416 inch (0.16 cm), you don\u2019t have to adjust the height of your pickups. Turn the top screw in the pickup so there\u2019s a \u204416 in (1.6 mm) gap.

        "Fit the truss rod wrench around the end of the truss rod and turn it counterclockwise a quarter of a turn to loosen the tension in the neck.",
        "This should bring your strings off the neck of the guitar and will give them some space.",
        "Keep in mind that there should be just a small amount of space between the strings and neck.",
        "If your truss rod is too tight, it will cause the neck of your guitar to bow.",
        "This may cause buzzing noises as you play.",
        "Screw the truss rod cover back on and wait a day.",
        "It may take some time for the neck to adjust to the new truss rod settings.",
        "Don\u2019t play the guitar for a day.",
        "Re-examine the guitar by holding down the fret closest to the body of the guitar and the first fret on the same string.",
        "The neck of the guitar should be slightly concave.",
        "The strings should slightly come off the neck of the guitar.",
        "Raising and Lowering the Bridge Measure the strings to the neck on the 12th fret.",
        "The distance between the strings and the neck at the 12th fret should be about 1.6 millimetres (0.063 in), or the width of a dime.",
        "Hold the flat end of a ruler against the neck and measure how high the strings are.",
        "If the strings are further than 1.6 millimetres (0.063 in), (high action) you need to lower the bridge.",
        "If the string has a low action, or the strings are less than 1.6 millimetres (0.063 in) from the neck at the 12th fret, you\u2019ll need to raise the bridge.",
        "Use an Allen wrench to raise or lower each string on the bridge.",
        "There should be small holes that can fit an Allen wrench on your bridge.",
        "Insert the wrench into the corresponding hole of the string you want to adjust and turn it 2-3 rotations to raise or lower the bridge.",
        "If the string is too high, turn the Allen wrench clockwise to lower the bridge.",
        "If the string is too low, turn the Allen wrench counterclockwise.",
        "Adjust each string until there is a 1.6 mm (0.063 in) gap on the 12th fret.",
        "Continue raising or lowering the bridge on each string until they are around 1.6 mm (0.063 in).",
        "Play each string while holding down the 12th fret.",
        "If the string buzzes when you strum it, it means that the string is too close to the frets.",
        "In this case, lower the bridge by turning the Allen wrench in the corresponding hole clockwise.",
        "If it's hard to push down the strings onto the neck, your strings may be too far from the frets.",
        "The \u201caction\u201d or distance between the strings and the neck differs among guitar players, but 1.6 mm (0.063 in) is standard for most guitar players.",

        "Michael currently plays lead guitar for Petty Theft, a tribute to Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.",
        "Michael Papenburg\t\t\tProfessional Guitarist\t\t\t\tPay attention to the curve of the fretboard.",
        "Try to make sure that the strings are following the arc of the fretboard.",
        "You can do this by adjusting the saddles.",
        "Also, make sure the strings are high enough so that they don't fret out or buzz when you're playing.",
        "Changing String Length by Adjusting the Bridge Tune your guitar with an electric tuner.",
        "The bridge elongates or shortens the length of your strings.",
        "If it\u2019s not adjusted correctly, notes down the neck of the guitar will be flat or sharp.",
        "Strum the top string next to the tuner and adjust the tuning knobs until it\u2019s an E. Put the rest of the guitar in standard E, A, D, G, B, E tuning.",
        "Strum the 6th string while holding down the 12th fret with a tuner.",
        "Holding down the 12th fret of the guitar should play the same note when you play the string without holding down any frets, otherwise known as the open position.",
        "Press down on the 12th fret on the top, or 6th string, and strum it.",
        "The note should be an E. If it isn't an E, you have to adjust the bridge.",
        "Turn the screw on the bridge clockwise if the note is sharp.",
        "If your note on the 12th fret is sharp, the string is too short and you need to lengthen it.",
        "Look at the bridge and find the screws on the bottom of the bridge.",
        "Locate the screw that corresponds with the string that you need to adjust.",
        "Use a Phillip\u2019s head screwdriver to turn the screw one full rotation clockwise.",

        "If the note is flat, or lower than an E, you\u2019ll need to elongate the string.",
        "Rotate the screws on the back of the bridge counterclockwise one full rotation to shorten the string.",
        "Check the note on the string when holding down the 12th fret.",
        "Turn on the tuner and hold down the 12th fret on the string that you just adjusted.",
        "Look at the note that is displayed on the tuner.",
        "If the note is still off when you hold down the 12th fret, you\u2019ll need to make additional adjustments to the bridge until the note is the same note as the string when played in the open position.",
        "Repeat the process on the 5 remaining strings.",
        "Continue the same process on the rest of the strings, making sure that the 12th fret note and the open note are the same.",
        "Adjust all of the strings on the bridge so that the notes are the same.",
        "The second string from the top of the neck should be an A, the third string from the top should D, and so on.",
        "Setting up the Pickups Hold down the fret closest to the pickups on the top string.",
        "The frets are the square spaces on your neck and the pickups are the rectangular studded pieces where you strum.",
        "Hold down the fret that\u2019s closest to the pickups on the top string, or 6th string, so that you can determine whether your strings are the correct distance from your pickups.",
        "If your strings are too close to your pickups, it could create feedback or unwanted gain.",
        "If the strings are too far from the pickups, you may not get the full sound from your guitar.",
        "Measure the distance between the pickup and the string.",
        "Hold the end of a ruler flat against the top of the pickups while continuing to hold down the fret.",
        "Measure the gap between the pickups and the strings.",
        "This distance should be around \u204416 inch (1.6 mm).",
        "If the distance is already \u204416 inch (0.16 cm), you don\u2019t have to adjust the height of your pickups.",
        "Turn the top screw in the pickup so there\u2019s a \u204416 in (1.6 mm) gap.",

        "Turn the top screw clockwise with a Phillip\u2019s head screwdriver to raise the pickup near the top string.",
        "Turn the screw counterclockwise to lower it.",
        "Adjust the pickup height until it\u2019s \u204416 inch (1.6 mm) from the string.",
        "Repeat the process on the bottom string.",
        "Hold down the bottom string on the fret closest to the pickup and measure the distance.",
        "This time, adjust the bottom screw to raise or lower the lower portion of the fret.",
        "Adjust it until this string is also \u204416 inch (1.6 mm) away from the pickups."
