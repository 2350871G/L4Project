A group of people who enjoy cooking is essential to creating a vibrant club. These people don\u2019t have to be close pals of yours, or even of each other, when the club starts. Rather, they have to be willing to pitch in and share in the cooking, and be the type that would actually enjoy that. Five or six people is a good size, especially if you\u2019re all trying to cook in one kitchen. Advertise online for possible foodie club members. Use Facebook, Twitter, MeetUp and other resources to find people. Leave small advertisements on community bulletin boards, inviting people to come along to a first meeting. Ask foodie friends along and ask them to see if they know of anyone who might like to come along as well. When seeking members, think carefully about the criteria. You might want people with families, single people, people with a busy lifestyle, etc.\u2013\u2013whatever matches your own needs is a good place to begin. Specify the parameters as part of your advertising. Decide where to hold the first club meeting. You may wish to have the first meeting at your house, if you feel it's safe enough to do so. It's always advisable to have other people you know and trust around when you first meet the new club members. If you're not sure about bringing them into your home to begin with, hold the first meeting at a local cafe, bar or restaurant\u2013-anywhere you can share and critique food together. After the club is established, the idea is to use your home kitchens and dining areas, once the trust is in place. At the first meeting, discuss meeting dates. Use an online calendar with reminder notices to help keep track of the cooking club dates. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/57\\/Start-a-Cooking-Club-Step-3Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Start-a-Cooking-Club-Step-3Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/57\\/Start-a-Cooking-Club-Step-3Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-760px-Start-a-Cooking-Club-Step-3Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nTry to aim for a regular monthly date.

While you\u2019ll need to have one person who organizes things a bit, the fun of a cooking club is sharing the labor. The location for meetings rotates as group members take turns hosting the monthly dinners. One possible approach: The host makes the main course, others bring appetizers, side dishes, desserts, and so on. Another approach: The host decides on the month's theme and allocates recipes or rosters specific members onto different aspects of the meal if cooking it together. A random approach: Don't ask, just turn up with a dish. If this means everyone turns up with snacks or dessert, that's dinner for the night! A cleaning roster is probably helpful too\u2013\u2013don't make it so that the host is left with all the cleaning up afterward! You might like to consider eco-friendly disposable plates and utensils, to lessen the cleaning burden. Keeping Intact the Spirit of Sharing and Learning Together Focus on friendship. A cooking club offers its members hospitality in its truest form. Our culture often misunderstands hospitality as entertaining in high style. But true hospitality is not about impressing people, or creating the perfect experience or the fanciest dishes around a Pinterest-worthy table. Rather, it\u2019s about being authentically welcoming, making others feel comfortable. Treat hospitality as your chance to express your love and warmth for others through sharing food, time and attention to each other. It isn't about who can do the better job at entertaining. Be welcoming and gracious when hosting others in your home. Be willing to try new things and to share ideas together, so that you all make interesting discoveries about the art of cooking. Enjoy the company of your friends as much as the food. Embrace imperfection. This is not a place to compete or try to outdo one another. The group members should understand that the cooking club is a place of giving each other the space to learn and to share. As Niequist notes, \"[i]t\u2019s about declaring your table a safe zone, a place of warmth and nourishment.\" Encourage the club members to experiment and be supportive when their endeavors don't work out as they'd hope. Use the lessons you all learn together to improve your cooking skills and techniques. Keep the memories and even share beyond your group. Take plenty of photos of the food you cook and the fun you are having together. Consider compiling an eBook of the recipes you make together and sending this around to each other. And if you like, share the photos (and recipes/tips) online with other friends and followers, on sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Google+. Readers will enjoy seeing the smiles and joy of club members, as well as learning something from your experiences. Consider running your own blog for the cooking club. Either a passionate enthusiast of blogging could take on this role, or all of you could offer to do a write-up in rotation. The blog could report on club events, recipes tried, cookbooks reviewed, club members' wisdom, etc. Pinterest, Indulgy and the like are good to use but avoid creating dishes and images for the sake of uploading. Use these sites as your club's tool to show what happened organically and without obligation, not as the mandatory directive for what your club should achieve.",
