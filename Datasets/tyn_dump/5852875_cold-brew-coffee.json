It's up to you, so experiment with the ration to find one you like! There is some debate about what grind to use. Some experts say that you want medium to course ground coffee beans as opposed to finely ground. This is because it makes for a slower, longer extraction of the coffee flavor into the water. Others advocate for a finely ground coffee, as you will get more extraction out of the beans. Since opinions vary, try grinding your beans both ways and figure out which you like better.
