                    "description": "Because the umbrella rig is so heavy, you need a medium heavy to heavy action rod to handle its weight. Many anglers prefer rods between 7 and 8 feet (2.1 to 2.4m) in length with graphite blanks. You need the additional length and stout action to heave the weight of the chandelier rig and attached lures, which can be as much as 4 ounces (1/4 pound, 113.4g), in repeated casts. Too short a rod or too spongy an action, and you'll tire yourself out quickly."

If you prefer a baitcasting reel, get one with a retrieve ratio of at least 5.5 to 1, or better yet, 6.5 to 1, with ball-bearing and designed to be taken apart easily when you need to clean it and a braking system to minimize backlashes. If you prefer a spinning reel, choose one designed to handle heavy line. You almost want a reel designed for saltwater fishing, but not quite."

If you plan to fish the Alabama jig in weeds or brush, use either jig heads with weed guards or heads designed to be fished self-weedless (inserted into the body of the plastic worm or grub they're baited with). You don't have to use all heads of the same weight. You can put the lightest heads, such as 1/8 ounce (3.55g). at the top, the next heaviest, such as 1/4 ounce (7.09g), at the bottom, and the heaviest, such as 1/2 ounce (14.17g), in the middle. This will give the illusion of a small school of baitfish of different sizes. Often, fish will strike at the jig in the center of the rig. Attach the jigheads to the arms with either the snaps attached to the ends or with split rings. Don't use leaders, as the added length will cause the jigs to foul around one another during the cast or retrieve."
