Remove the brownies slab from the baking pan using a spatula and place it on a cooling rack. If you need an oven mitt to handle the baking pan, it\u2019s not cooled down enough. Place the brownies slab on a metal baking tray with parchment or wax paper. Cover a clean metal baking tray with a layer of either parchment or wax paper.

If possible, do not frost your brownies before storing them in the freezer. Put the tray with your brownies slab into the freezer to flash freeze it.

If you aren\u2019t able to obtain both plastic wrap and foil, you can use one or the other. Make sure the entire brownies slab is completely covered with either the plastic wrap or foil to prevent freezer burn. Store the wrapped brownies slab in a large plastic freezer bag for 3 months.
