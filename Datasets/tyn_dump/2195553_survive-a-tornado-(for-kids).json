Warnings are issued when a tornado is in your area and is almost guaranteed to hit. Especially if the storm is already upon you, get yourself and your family to the basement quickly and safely. Don't forget your pets! If you have a few extra minutes, consider grabbing bike helmets. It may sound silly, but wearing a helmet during the tornado will protect your head from flying debris and broken glass, and possibly even save your life. For toddlers and babies, strapping them into a car seat will protect and stabilize them during a tornado just like it would in a car accident. For even more protection from the tornado, sit underneath a heavy piece of furniture such as a table, or lay in the bathtub with blankets over the top of you. Pretty much anything between you and the tornado will help keep you at least a little bit more protected."
