                    "description": "Since rain is added to a finished painting, choose a landscape, cityscape, or subject to paint with acrylics. Once you're happy with the acrylic painting, set it aside to dry. It's important to let it it dry completely so you don't smear the acrylic paint when you paint the rain on top.Tip: To help your painting dry faster, put it in a warm room with good circulation. You might choose a busy street scene with lampposts and people holding umbrellas or a country setting with storm clouds on the horizon, for instance. In general, it will take about 30 minutes for an acrylic painting to dry."

To help the rain blend into your work, squirt transparent mixing white onto the palette instead. Transparent mixing white isn't as opaque as titanium white so you'll be able to see the acrylic painting underneath it."

Then, hold the brush vertically and tap it onto your palette a few times to distribute the white.

Use a light touch to lightly cover your painting with rain falling at an angle. If you're painting a heavy storm, you may want to go over the canvas a few times."

Paint the streaks in the same angle. To make streaks in the foreground stand out more, you could mix a little titanium white into the transparent mixing white so it's more opaque."

Use your liner brush to paint a tiny circle that's a little darker than the subject's color. Then, mix a little white into the paint and use it to paint a sliver on the bottom 1/2 of the circle. Add a dot of pure white near the top of the circle. The dot will make the circle look like light is reflecting off of the raindrop."
