You should also attach the horn to your grinder so you can begin filling the casings. To make the casings slide on easier, wipe the horn with a wet cloth.

For natural casings, you'll also need to blow air into the casings which will help when you slide them onto the horn. Slide a casing onto the horn and tie a knot at the loose end. Once you've soaked the casings, remove them from the water and slide 1 onto the horn attached to your grinder. Use twine to tie a very tight knot 1 in (2.5 cm) from the loose end of the casing. Stuff the nduja into the casing. Use 1 hand to hold the casing and the other hand to feed the nduja through the grinder. Keep filling the casing so the nduja is evenly distributed and the casing moves away from the grinder. Tie off the other end of the casing and fill the remaining 3 casings.
