A wide-toothed comb is also important when working with curly hair. In fact, the wider the better! This will detangle your hair and it won't stretch out the hair as much and will help prevent frizz.

Furthermore, curls spring up and get shorter as they dry, so you're at risk of cutting your layers too short if you chop them while they're wet. It's okay if your hair is a little damp, as long as it is not wet. Cutting dry hair gives you less control over it, so if you're finding it too hard to manage sectioning and cutting completely dry hair, you can lightly dampen it with a spray bottle."

        "Use several small chops until you've trimmed all of the hair.",
        "Then, angle your scissors so they're nearly parallel to your hair, and cut a few times into your hair to thin the ends out slightly.",
        "Repeat the process on the next section.",
        "Unclip one of the sections next to the first.",
        "Pull the hair straight up, or at the same outward angle that you used when you cut the first section.",
        "Use the first section as a guide to determine how much hair to trim\u2014hold up both pieces of hair next to each other, and cut off the new section to be the same length as the first.",
        "When pulling sections upwards to trim them, try to use the same amount of tension so that one section doesn't end up shorter than another.",
        "Continue lifting and cutting each section in the same way.",
        "Bring each section up and forward to the same imaginary point above your head before making the cut.",
        "Because the hair on the bottom of your head has further to travel when it is lifted up above your head, it will end up being longer than the hair on top of your head.",
        "Don't try to use this process for the bottom sections at the nape of your neck.",
        "If you leave these unlayered, they will provide a strong, heavy bottom layer.",
        "If you layer them, the ends of your hair might appear too thin.",
        "Finish your cut by trimming any areas that stick out.",
        "Once you are done cutting the basic layers, let your hair fall naturally around your head, like you would normally wear it.",
        "If there are pieces that look too long or that stick out too far away from the rest of your hair, give them a quick trim.",
        "The overall shape of your hair should be fairly even and symmetrical.",
        "If the curls on one side of your head are sticking out a lot farther than they are on the other side, resection the longer hair and trim each of these sections to be a little shorter."
