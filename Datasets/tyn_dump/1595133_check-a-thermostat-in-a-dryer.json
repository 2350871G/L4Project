To completely eliminate the risk of electrical shock, shut off the room\u2019s electricity and unplug the dryer. The circuit breaker switches or fuses are normally labeled.

Give the dryer at least 30 minutes from its last use before beginning to take it apart. If you open the dryer and still detect heat, give it more time to cool. Make sure you can test the thermostat when it is at room temperature. Normally, dryers cool down on their own. If something breaks, your dryer may stay hot and require you to shut off the electricity to get it to cool. Note that your dryer may not heat at all when the thermostat is broken. Other times, excessive heat is a sign of a dead thermostat or heating element."
