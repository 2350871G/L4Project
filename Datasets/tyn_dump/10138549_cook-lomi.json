Stir it together so none of your ingredients get stuck on the bottom of the pot. Bring the water to a boil. Preheat the water on a separate burner to speed up the process.

Miki noodles can be purchased at your local Asian food market. Otherwise, you can use any other form of egg noodle. Scallions can be added later if you want them to remain crunchy. Thickening and Serving the Lomi Beat an egg in a small bowl until the yolk and whites combine. Use a whisk to combine the yolk and egg white of the egg. Keep mixing until you don\u2019t see any separation and so it has a smooth consistency. Pour the beaten egg into the broth. Slowly tip the bowl so a small stream of egg pours into the lomi. Use your other hand to stir the lomi continuously so the egg mixes throughout the entire broth. If you do not stir while you pour, the egg will cook and clump rather than have a smooth consistency. Thicken the broth with 1 tablespoon (7.5 g) of cornstarch. Dump the cornstarch a little bit at a time and stir it into the lomi completely. Cornstarch acts as a thickening agent when it hits the water and will give your lomi better texture. Premix a little water into the cornstarch to pour it into the lomi easier. Add salt and pepper and let the soup simmer until the broth thickens. Keep the lomi on low heat for another 2 minutes and stir it occasionally. The cornstarch and egg will continue to thicken the broth in this time. Serve the lomi hot and garnish it with soy sauce for added flavor. Use a ladle to transfer the lomi into a serving bowl. Make sure you have a little bit of each ingredient in the bowl. If you want, you can add a little soy sauce to enhance the flavor. Chop a hard-boiled egg to use as added garnish.",
