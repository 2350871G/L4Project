If your hair is short or layered, and pieces fall out when you make a ponytail, use colored barrettes instead of a headband (they're cute, and give you that nice,unique look). {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/f4\\/Be-a-Popular-Girl-in-a-Private-School-Step-1Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Be-a-Popular-Girl-in-a-Private-School-Step-1Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/f4\\/Be-a-Popular-Girl-in-a-Private-School-Step-1Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-760px-Be-a-Popular-Girl-in-a-Private-School-Step-1Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nNails: If nail polish is allowed, don't be afraid to use different colors like neons or sparkly polishes.

Usually, they have to be dress shoes and/or be a certain color. If there are no rules about shoes, wear cute ones like uggs. Ballet flats are always cute. White vans are great as well, even though many people have them. You might be allowed to wear high heels. If you can, don't wear really tall ones and only wear heels in high school, otherwise you're just going to look weird. If you can, wear Toms. They are for a good cause, make you seem nice and giving, and are super cute. Also, Sperrys are cute too. You might think they're just for preppies but they're not. If your school allows it, get the ones with your favorite colors and patterns on the side. Also, try to wear colors that match your uniform. For example, if you wear a navy and green plaid skirt, wear navy or green shoes. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/6\\/67\\/Be-a-Popular-Girl-in-a-Private-School-Step-1Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Be-a-Popular-Girl-in-a-Private-School-Step-1Bullet3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/6\\/67\\/Be-a-Popular-Girl-in-a-Private-School-Step-1Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Be-a-Popular-Girl-in-a-Private-School-Step-1Bullet3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nMake up: Do not go overboard on the make up; natural make up looks casual and pretty!

A bit of concealer, face powder, light blush or bronzer, thin eyeliner on top eyelash line, mascara and a very light lipstick - if you apply these things lightly, it will make your face look really pretty and not fake or caked on.
