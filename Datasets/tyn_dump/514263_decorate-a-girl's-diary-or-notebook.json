This will act as a protective sealant and help keep your design in place. Wait for the sealant to set and dry before using your diary or notebook or adding additional decorations. Decorating with Markers Select a diary or notebook with a plain paper or fabric cover. Alternatively, you can make your own paper cover. Try to select a material that is not too slick or glossy, so your marker won\u2019t smudge. Buy some markers. Make sure to get permanent markers that will not smudge or wipe off once the ink dries.

Allow the ink to dry completely before using your diary or notebook. Using Adhesive Decorations Decorate your diary or notebook with stick-on gems or stickers. This is one of the easiest ways to decorate your cover. Buy some stickers or gems with adhesive backs and place them wherever you like. For an extra layer of protection over flat stickers, brush on a layer of decoupage adhesive (like Mod Podge). Decorate your diary or notebook with washi tape. Washi tape is a type of decorative tape that comes in a variety of colors and patterns. Cover your entire notebook with strips of washi tape, fold the edges of the tape inside the cover, and create a tidy border by cutting off the excess with a precision knife.
