You can even use baking soda as natural deodorant. Being a Part of Society Use the library. Public and university libraries are excellent resources for people living on the street. You can use the computers, access the internet, apply for jobs, read a book or magazine, gain shelter, and take advantage of the bathroom. If you are interested in finding a steady job and housing, the library can help you attain that. Travel light. You don\u2019t want to alert people to the fact that you are living on the streets because they will make assumptions about you and are likely to want you to stay away from them. This is especially important for if you are accessing stores, office buildings, and other facilities. Look for somewhere safe to stash extra items, or reduce your possessions so that they easily fit into a backpack and tote. When carrying a backpack, try to look like you\u2019re either a hiking-enthusiast or a bicyclist who carries a backpack for convenience. Try to use a bag that looks like a standard tote or reusable grocery bag so that people will assume that you are on your way home from shopping. Get a post office box. While you will have to pay for it, a post office box can be instrumental in helping you maintain a lifestyle or get back on your feet if that\u2019s your desire. You can have mail sent to your post office box, store small items in your box, and use it as an address on job applications. You may not be able to use it as an address to get services, but some post office box options will provide you with a usable address, so ask about your options. Protecting Yourself Be alert. Your safety depends on you being aware of your surroundings. Living on the streets can be dangerous, especially since you can\u2019t always tell who to trust. In addition to some people posing a threat to your safety, people may assume that you are the threat. Be cautious and courteous. Stay with a group. As the cliche says, there is safety in numbers. Try to form partnerships with other people living on the streets so that you can keep each other safe. Living as a group will also allow you the option of keeping more possessions because you can take turns watching each other\u2019s stuff. Learn police patterns. While the police usually mean security, for a person living on the streets they can also be a threat. Because of prejudices against people on the streets, you may be viewed as a criminal, especially in certain neighborhoods. Know where they tend to patrol and use that information to make the best decisions about where to sleep and where to seek shelter. Depending on your area and race, a police presence could make a place safer or less safe for sleeping. If you have a good relationship with the police in your area, then sleeping on their patrols could be a good option for you. Always be respectful when interacting with the police, even if you feel you are being treated unfairly. Know your rights. When you live on the streets, you have to know the law well enough to protect yourself. No matter what anyone says, you still have rights. For example, in the U.S. you can legally hold up a sign asking for money in a public location because that falls under the First Amendment. On the flip side, some cities do have laws and ordinances that address the homeless population, so you need to check with local nonprofits to get that information. You can find pamphlets and more information at organizations such as the ACLU and nonprofits that focus on helping those who live on the streets. If you don\u2019t know where to start, ask for help at your local soup kitchen or use the resources at the public library to do research. Seek shelter during a storm. During harsh weather, don\u2019t follow your normal sleeping patterns. Storms present an emergency situation when you\u2019re living on the streets. Try places like transit terminals where you can blend in with stranded riders, or walk the aisles of an open shop if it\u2019s during the day. You can also look for 24-hr waiting areas at airports or hospitals. If you do have a local airport, blend in with fellow travelers, which should allow you to take a nap in the waiting area. Be sure to move around, though, so that no one becomes suspicious. Wear a hat. The sun can be dangerous, so use a hat to protect yourself from exposure. Additionally, a hat can help you stay warmer in cold weather. Visit a thrift store to find an affordable option that goes with your clothing so that it looks like a style choice. Wear sunscreen. While it costs money, sunscreen will protect you from both skin cancer and detection. Sunburn is a common ailment among those living on the streets, so keep your status hidden by avoiding a red face. Protect your belongings. Living on the streets means that you\u2019ll have to either reduce your belongings to what you can carry or establish a home base. If you work with a partner or group, then you can take turns guarding each other\u2019s possessions. Find out if a local shelter allows for people to store items there. Carry a large stick or umbrella to ward off possible thieves. Cover your belongings when you sleep, and if possible wrap part of the bag around your leg or arm so that if someone tries to steal it they\u2019ll risk waking you.",
