Look for steaks that are marbled, where the white stripes of fat are interspersed evenly throughout the meat. Choose steaks with a light, bright red color, and pick steaks that are 1 inch (25.4 mm) to 1-1/2 inches (38.1 mm) thick. Ask the butcher to cut you a fresh steak if they all seem brown on the outside -- this means they have been sitting out in the air for too long."

                    "description": "Many people swear that a grilled steak, with a little salt and pepper, is one of nature's finest meals. Sirloins, though not extra tender, pack a lot of flavor even without seasoning. The real flavor comes from the interaction between the meat and the heat source. They only need a light searing on the outside to taste flavorful and juicy. Depending on your grill, you may get very different flavors from your steak:\n\nPropane: Gas grills impart little additional flavor on the meat. They are, however, easy to control and get hot the quickest. You can adjust the temperatures with a simple knob, allowing you to perfect the cooking process to your liking, and they usually have attached thermometers. Charcoal: Briquettes light up relatively fast and get hot quickly. They impart the \"classic\" BBQ flavor, with a hint of smokiness, but are a bit trickier to get to the right temperature. Wood-fire: Wood chips, like hickory or oak, give the best natural flavor to the meat. However, they are harder to maintain and light, so many people use a mixture of charcoal and wood to get the best of both worlds."
