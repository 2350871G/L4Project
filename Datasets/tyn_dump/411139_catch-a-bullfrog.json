If you are planning to just catch frogs for fun, you may want different tools than if you're planning to eat frog legs for dinner. Bullfrogs can be caught bare-handed, but your hands should be clean and wet. Bullfrogs absorb things through their skin, so dirty hands could harm the frog. Alternatively, you may want to consider other tools, such as a frog gig. A frog gig is especially good for catching larger bullfrogs. If you don\u2019t have a frog gig, a fishing net is also a good option. You\u2019ll also need a flashlight and something to hold the bullfrogs, like a bucket. If you are catching frogs to keep in an aquarium, you may want to use a net or your hands. A fishing net with a longer pole works best! The brighter the flashlight, the better! If you use a fishing pole, a fly fishing lure without a barb is a good choice. If you're transporting the frog, consider bringing a large plastic bucket with a lid."
