Another option is to use in-row cooling units, which do not require a raised floor and move the compressor to the roof. You may want a ceiling that is at least 12 to 18 feet (3.7 to 5.5 m) high. Keep a thermometer in the room to ensure the temperature is moderate. A dehumidifier may be necessary if the room gets too humid."
