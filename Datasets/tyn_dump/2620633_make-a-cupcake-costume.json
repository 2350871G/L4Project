Staple the sheets of poster board together as you fold them. If possible, hide the staples inside the folds. You could also use heavy foil-based wrapping paper instead of poster board. Make an accordion fold by taking your first section of poster board and folding it over the remaining board. Make another section that is equal in width, but fold the board in the opposite direction so that the end of the board is still visible.

If the laundry basket is too narrow for the wearer to slip on, you may also need to cut a straight line down the back. The basket will keep its shape, but you will be able to spread it apart enough to slip on if needed. If you cannot find a round laundry basket, you could also use a large, plastic, bucket-shaped toy tub. Attach straps to the basket.

Punch the holes on the inner folds to conceal them. Loop pipe cleaners or craft wire through these holes and around the cross bars of the basket. Making the Frosting Cut the legs off two pairs of tights. Use adult-size tights. The color you use will depend on the type of \"frosting\" you want your cupcake to have. Use white tights for vanilla, brown tights for chocolate, and pink tights for strawberry. Cut the legs off in a straight line, not at an angle. For taller children and adults, you may need to use three pairs of tights. Fill the tights. Stuff each cut leg with batting or polyfill stuffing. Knot the open ends. Pack the tights so that they feel full, but not so full that they become stiff an unable to mold. Glue the legs together. Use a hot glue gun to adhere the stuffed, sealed ends of the stuffed tights together, positioning them end to end. You could be left with one long, snake-like tube of stuffed tights. Let the glue dry. Attach the \"frosting\" to the basket. Line 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) of the top basket rim with hot glue. Fix one end of the stuffed tights to this spot.
