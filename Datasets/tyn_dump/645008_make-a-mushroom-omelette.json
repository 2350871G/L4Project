Be sure to scrub the mushrooms with a soft-bristled brush to remove any dirt. You don't need to peel them. Heat 1 teaspoon (5 grams) of unsalted butter in a medium-sized frying pan over medium heat. Save the rest of the butter for the frying the eggs. Wait until the butter starts to sizzle and foam. When the butter starts to sizzle, add the mushrooms, some salt, and some pepper. How much salt you use is up to your personal tastes. For extra flavor, add 1 clove minced garlic. You can also add some sliced onion or scallions. Fry the mushrooms until they turn soft and brown. This will take about 4 minutes. Stir the mushrooms from time to time using a spatula, so they don't burn. Remove the mushrooms from the pan, and set them aside.
