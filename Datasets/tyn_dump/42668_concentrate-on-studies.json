Some a little more, some a little less. How many hours do you like to sleep, when you don't have to set an alarm? Try to get that every night by going to bed a bit earlier than usual, as required. Eat healthy. You are what you eat after all, and if you eat healthy, your mind will be healthy, too. Aim to eat your favourite colourful fruits and veggies, whole grains, lean meats and dairy, nuts (not greasy fries/chips and fattening candy), and good fats, like the ones in dark chocolate and olive oil. A healthy diet will keep you more energized and make it easier to put your mind to the test. Avoid white foods like white bread, potatoes, flour, grease and sugar. They're just \"dead\" foods and sugary drinks that cause you to crash in class and at study time. Take control of your thoughts. You are your motivation when it comes down to it. If you convince yourself you can focus, you can. Grab your mind by the horns are start thinking positive: you can do this and you will. There's nothing stopping you but you. Try the \"5 More\" rule. Tell yourself to do only five more things or five more minutes before quitting. Once you've finished those, do another five. Breaking tasks up into smaller chunks makes things easier for those with shorter concentration spans and it keeps your mind going longer. Do the least pleasant tasks first. While fresh, you can sizzle with the highest powers of concentration at your disposal. Do the most critical and deep background concepts early before moving onto easier (less challenging) but necessary grinding out of details. If you do the easier tasks first, you will be thinking about and stressing about the harder ones the whole time, reducing your productivity and ability to focus. That being said, avoid bogging yourself down when reading, or getting stuck and defeated on difficult problems or essay questions. Sometimes the least desirable part of an assignment may be too time-consuming and it could drain/kill all your available time. So try to limit your time and self-supervise to move on to easier matters, if absolutely necessary. Using Technology To Your Advantage See whether alpha wave sound tones will give you, the listener, improved focus, memory and concentration for study and other activities. Search on YouTube for a BiNaural Beat, and use of headphones or earbuds are required. If BiNaural Beats work for you, this will be like magic! Listen while studying. For best results you should listen on a low to medium volume during your study period. Prolonged use is not harmful. Follow all the concentration steps and tips. When combined with a good timetable, food, rest and anything else that benefits your study, this track may improve your memory. Study is such an important part of life and to learn how to maintain good focus and concentration is a lifelong skill. Check how the environment sounds after the BiNaural Beat. After listening for a few hours your ears will take a few minutes to readjust to the normal ambient sounds in the room. It is perfectly normal, if your hearing is a little distorted. Many other strange effects are possible with BiNaural Beat, but for the majority they work. Headaches are normal for about 10-25 minutes, this is your brain adjusting to the beat. If it does not subside after 30 minutes, better to leave this out of your routine. Music can also be played along with the beat to make the sound more appealing. Together they may aid further in concentration.",
