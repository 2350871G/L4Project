For safety\u2019s sake, wait until the pie has had a chance to cool to room temperature before enjoying a slice, no matter how tempted you might be to dig in.

Cover the dough completely with the plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator to chill. It can stay in there for as little as 30 minutes or as long as 4 days, if you\u2019re not planning on baking your pie right away.When half an hour has passed, press a fingertip into your dough to see if it\u2019s the right texture. It should be about as firm as a stick of cold butter. It\u2019s important to keep your dough properly chilled throughout the entire pie-making process. Pie crust dough is easiest to work with and comes out tasting best if stays between 68\u201372 \u00b0F (20\u201322 \u00b0C). Roll your dough out into 2 disks. Once your dough has been in the refrigerator for a minimum of 30 minutes, take it out, unwrap it, and separate it into 2 equal-sized mounds by hand. Then, use a rolling pin to press both mounds into uniform circles that are each roughly \u20448 in (0.32 cm) thick. Roll your first circle out to a diameter of about 12\u201313 inches (30\u201333 cm) and spread it out over the edge of a pie plate or pan. The second only needs to be 11\u201312 inches (28\u201330 cm) in order to cover your pie filling.A pastry scraper can come in handy for peeling the rolled dough off of your work surface in one piece. After rolling out your top and bottom pie crusts, return both pieces to the fridge and chill them for another 30 minutes.Tip: Dust your countertop, a large cutting board, or another suitable work surface with a light coating of flour to prevent your dough from sticking. Put together your pie filling. In a large mixing bowl, combine 8 cups of frozen peaches (about three 1 lb packages), 1/2 cup (100 g) of sugar, 1/2 teaspoon (2 g) of cinnamon, 1\u20132 teaspoons (4.9\u20139.9 mL) of lemon juice, 4 tablespoons (30 g) of cornstarch, and a small pinch of kosher salt. Fold the ingredients thoroughly with a spatula until they\u2019re evenly mixed.For this recipe, both the lemon juice and cinnamon are optional add-ins. You\u2019re free to use as much or as little of either ingredient as you wish to suit your own tastes. The cornstarch will counteract the moisture from the frozen peaches and help thicken up the filling as your pie bakes. Spoon your filling into your pie crust and chill for another 30 minutes. Take the dough for your bottom pie crust out of the refrigerator and add the filling mixture. Place the filled crust back in the fridge for an additional half hour to ensure that all of your components are a consistent temperature.Scrape the bottom of the bowl with your spatula or a small spoon to make sure you get out every last bit of filling. Cover the filled pie with the dough for the top crust. Remove the second, smaller disk you rolled out earlier from the fridge and spread it out over the top of the pie, trimming the excess dough from around the edges with a pair of scissors if necessary. Work your way around the pie, crimping the edges of the dough with your fingertips to seal the two layers. Finally, use a sharp knife to cut 3-5 thin slits near the center of the pie. This will allow steam to escape while the pie is baking.You can also crimp the edges of your pie crust with the tines of a work to create a more intricate patterned look. For a slightly fancier presentation, slice the top crust into 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm) strips and weave the strips into an overlapping lattice formation on top of the pie. Bake your pie for about 1 hour at 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C). Rearrange the racks in your oven so that one rack is resting near the bottom third of the oven. Then, slide the pie inside and shut the door. Immediately after putting it in, set a timer on the oven or your phone to keep track of how long it\u2019s been baking.Begin preheating while you\u2019re chilling your pie for the final time. That way, you won\u2019t have to wait for it to warm up once you\u2019re ready to actually start baking. Alternatively, bake your pie for 15 minutes at 425 \u00b0F (218 \u00b0C), then lower the temperature to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) and continue heating for 35-40 minutes. This will help you achieve a nice brown crust while also ensuring that the filling get cooked all the way through. Let your pie cool for at least 3-4 hours before serving. Once the top crust is perfectly golden-brown and the filling begins to bubble out through the ventilation slits, turn off the oven and carefully pull out the pie using a thick oven mitt. Set the pie on a heat-safe surface and allow it to cool completely.The filling of your pie will be extremely hot when it first comes out of the oven. For safety\u2019s sake, wait until the pie has had a chance to cool to room temperature before enjoying a slice, no matter how tempted you might be to dig in. If you like your pie warm, you can always place it back in the oven at around 250 \u00b0F (121 \u00b0C) until it reaches the desired temperature, or zap a single serving in the microwave for 20-30 seconds.",
