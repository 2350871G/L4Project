Hardness impacts the final look or sheen of a wire project and can impact on how well the project presents. If you are using copper or aluminium, you are working with soft metals, whereas iron is hard."

Finer wires are made from the most ductile metals, and less ductile metals produce thicker wires. The order of ductility is (most to least):\nGold\nSilver\nPlatinum\nIron\nCopper\nAluminium\nZinc\nTin\nLead"

If you are not sure, always practise on a test piece first and hammer it flat to see what happens.

Also, you will need to familiarise yourself with the differing gauges of wire available. The thinness and thickness of the wire you choose will be dependent on the projects you are making. Visit a store and check them out, feel them and see what works for you. It can help to purchase a range of samples to play around with in your workshop to see what works best for your creativity."
