        "Take the section of the strand next to your power source and run it up the closest wall or post toward the overhanging structure.",
        "Start at the outer perimeter and work your way around, or guide the lights back and forth across the rafters if you want them to run through the center of the patio.",
        "You\u2019ll have the easiest time working in 3\u20135 ft (0.91\u20131.52 m), or roughly arm\u2019s length.",
        "Staple the lights to the overhanging structure in regular intervals.",
        "Use a staple gun loaded with \u20444 in (0.64 cm) staples to secure the cord to your patio cover.",
        "If you want your lights to have a tight, cinched-down look, place a staple at the midpoint between every bulb.",
        "If you\u2019d prefer them to hang down a little looser, try spacing out your staples every 2-3 bulbs.",
        "Be sure to staple the cord just above the outlet, as well.",
        "You could also use cord clips if you don\u2019t want to put holes in the wall or vertical support post.",
        "Take the time to line your staples up over the center of the cord to avoid damaging the wiring components.",
        "Doing so could create a fire hazard.Tip: Attempting to handle a strand of lights and a staple gun at the same time can be tricky.",
        "It may help to have someone else hold a section in place while you staple it down.",
        "Hook up additional strands as needed as you go.",
        "When you reach the end of your first strand of lights, grab a second strand and connect the ends.",
        "Continue joining and stapling in this way until you\u2019ve covered every last foot of the path you outlined earlier.",
        "When you\u2019re finished, flip on your new lights and watch them shine!",
        "Check the manufacturer\u2019s instructions included with your lights to find out the maximum recommended number of couplings per outlet.",
        "If you connect too many strands, it could result in a short.",
        "Putting up String Lights Quickly Measure and mark where you want to anchor your lights.",
        "Eyeball the structure overhanging your patio and decide how you\u2019d like your lights to hang.",
        "When you\u2019ve settled on a layout, draw a small dot or line on the surface of the structure in pencil to indicate each point of attachment.",
        "Use a tape measure to ensure that the distance between each point is consistent.",
        "Try to devise a simple hanging pattern that\u2019s the same on each side of your patio.",
        "For rectangular patios, make sure the opposing sides mirror one another.",
        "If each side of your patio is 12 feet (3.7 m) long, for example, you might place an anchor every 4\u20136 feet (1.2\u20131.8 m).Tip: For a fast, fuss-free solution, just put an anchor on the inside of each corner and call it a day.",
        "You can adjust the tautness of the light strands later to get them hanging just right.",
        "Pre-drill pilot holes for your wall anchors.",
        "Guide the drill roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) into the vertical edge of your overhanging structure at a 90-degree angle.",
        "Be sure to equip a bit that matches the width of the thread pattern of your anchors.",
        "Drill a hole for each anchor you plan on installing.",
        "A standard #8 screw hook has a diameter of 3.95 millimetres (0.156 in).",
        "You should be able to find the dimensions of the anchors you\u2019re using listed somewhere on the packaging.",
        "Insert screw hooks into each of your pilot holes.",
        "Place the tapered end of the hook into the hole, then rotate the hook clockwise to sink it.",
        "Continue twisting the hook until the threads are no longer visible.",
        "Make sure each hook is pointed upwards so that it will cradle your light strands.",
        "You can speed up the process by fitting an eye bit into your drill, looping it over the end of the hook, and pulling the trigger in bursts until the anchor is seated snugly.",
        "Consider filling in the space around the edges of the holes with silicone caulk to form a tighter seal around the hooks.",
        "This will prevent them from becoming larger with time and constant pressure.",
        "Thread your light strands through the anchor hooks.",
        "Now all that\u2019s left to do is hang the lights.",
        "Plug your first strand into the nearest available power source and begin running the cord from one anchor to the next in the desired configuration.",
        "Connect additional strands as needed until you\u2019ve covered your chosen path.",
        "One cool thing about using screw hooks is that you can experiment with multiple hanging patterns using a handful of anchors.",
        "You can also change up the configuration as often as you like, since the cords aren't actually fastened down.",
        "If you want to be certain that your lights stay put, attach mini carabiners to the holes at the top of each bulb socket, then clip them to the hooks.",
        "The weight will help hold the strands in place.",
        "As an added benefit, carabiners also make it easier to keep several connected strands in one piece, which is useful if you think you might take your lights down at any point."
