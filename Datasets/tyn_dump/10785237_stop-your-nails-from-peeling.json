                    "description": "If you've noticed that your nails have been peeling, it's time to take a few weeks to help them heal before you apply more polish. In the meantime, get an acetone-free nail polish remover from your drugstore (acetone dries out your cuticles so it's best to avoid it), and use it to remove any polish currently on your nails. Don't peel or chip nail polish. Doing so is really hard on your nails, and the act of peeling or chipping often strips away a layer of nail. Use cotton balls or swabs to apply the nail polish remover. Rub each nail gently until the polish comes off. If you currently have a gel or shellac manicure, you'll need to use acetone-based remover to get the polish off this time. Always follow up with a moisturizer after you remove nail polish. Even an acetone-free nail polish remover can dry out your nails."

After you shower, use a pair of nail clippers to trim your nails so that their edges are about even with the tips of your fingers. Repeat this once per week until your nails have stopped peeling. Your nails will be softer after you take a hot shower or bath, making it the best time to clip them to keep them from breaking more. Make sure to use clean nail clippers.
