Cut in the shortening and blend until the mixture looks like coarse crumbs. You can do this in a food processor fitted steel blades or in a medium sized bowl with a pastry blender. Do not over mix, or the dough will get too soft and mushy. Cut in the butter and blend some more. Again, don't over mix it. The butter, shortening, salt, and flour should just come together. You want the mixture to still resemble coarse crumbs. If you are using a food processor, you can transfer the mixture into a medium sized bowl once you mix the butter in. Add cold water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough stops clinging to the side of the bowl. Gently toss the dough while you add the water. The dough should just barely come together. If it is too dry, add a little bit more water, until it does. Don't worry if it looks too dry; it will dampen once you put it in the fridge.

Wrap the disk with some parchment paper, wax paper, or plastic wrap. This will help the dough keep its disk shape. It will also trap moisture and keep it from drying it.

Baking the Crust Pre-heat the oven to 375\u00b0F (190.56\u00b0C).  Take the dough out of the fridge and roll it out into a disk on a lightly floured surface. Unwrap the dough first, then lightly flour a flat, smooth surface. Place the dough onto the surface. Roll the dough out to a 11 to 12 inch (27.94 to 30.48 centimeters) circle.

        "This will help the pie crust keep its shape while you bake it.",
        "If you don't have parchment paper, you can use a sheet of aluminum foil instead.",
        "If you can't find pie weights you can use dried beans or rice.",
        "Bake the pie crust.",
        "Place it into the oven and let it bake for 20 minutes.",
        "Then, take it out of the oven, pull out the parchment paper/aluminum foil and weights.",
        "Place the pie crust back into the oven and back it for another 15 to 20 minutes.",
        "It is done when it is golden brown on the bottom.",
        "Take the pie crust out of the oven, and let it cool in the pan.",
        "The pie crust should be cool before you add the banana cream filling.",
        "Do not take the crust out of the pan.",
        "Making the Filling Mix the sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a medium saucepan.",
        "There is no need to use any heat just yet.",
        "Gradually whisk in the half-and-half.",
        "Do not pour it in all at once.",
        "Instead, slowly pour it into the mixture while you stir with a whisk.",
        "If you don't have any half-and-half, you can use heavy cream instead Separate the egg yolks from the whites, and stir them in.",
        "If you have not already done so, separate the egg yolks from the egg whites.",
        "Discard the whites, or save them for another recipe.",
        "Stir the mixture until the yolks break.",
        "If you have an egg separator, use that.",
        "Another way to separate yolks from whites is to crack open an egg and pass the yolk between the two shell halves over a bowl.",
        "The whites will drain into the bowl and the yolks will stay in the shells.",
        "Add the milk last, and stir once more.",
        "Keep stirring until everything is mixed together, and there are no streaks, swirls, or clumps.",
        "Cook the mixture over medium-low to medium heat until it thickens.",
        "This will take about 5 to 10 minutes.",
        "Be sure to stir constantly, and do not try to rush through it by turning the heat up.",
        "After about 5 to 10 minutes, the mixture will look a little bit like pudding that has not yet set.",
        "Remove the saucepan from heat, and strain the mixture if you want a smoother filling.",
        "Place a fine, mesh strainer over another medium sized saucepan.",
        "Pour the mixture through the strainer and discard and lumps or curdles.",
        "Stir in the butter and vanilla and let the mixture cool for about 5 minutes.",
        "Stir often until the mixture has cooled slightly.",
        "Your pie filling is now done and ready to use.",
        "Don't worry if it looks a little thin.",
        "You will need to refrigerate the entire pie after you put it together.",
        "This will \"set\" the filling and make it thicker.",
        "Putting the Pie Together Peel and slice up 2 bananas.",
        "You want the slices to be thin, about \u00bc inch (0.64 centimeter) thick.",
        "Plan on having another extra banana so that you can slice it up and use it to decorate the pie with.",
        "Do not pre-slice this \"decorating\" banana, however, or it will turn brown.",
        "Fill the bottom of the pie crust the with sliced bananas.",
        "To get the most out of your sliced bananas, place the slices down flat, one by one.",
        "Don't just dump them all in.",
        "This will give you a 2-layer pie.",
        "If you want a 3-layer pie, fill the bottom of crust part way with the pie filling first.",
        "Spread a thin layer of sliced bananas on top of the mixture.",
        "Fill the crust the rest of the way with the remaining pie pilling.",
        "Fill the crust with the pie filling.",
        "You may need to use a spoon or spatula to help guide the filling into the crust.",
        "Keep adding the filling until it just reaches the top of the crust.",
        "If you run out of pie filling, don't fret.",
        "You can always top the pie off with more sliced bananas and whipped cream.",
        "Place a sheet of plastic wrap over the filling.",
        "The plastic wrap will keep the pie from forming a \"skin\" on top.",
        "Refrigerate the pie 3 to 6 hours, then remove the plastic wrap.",
        "This will give the pie filling enough time to set into a thick, pudding or custard like consistency.",
        "Decorate the pie with whipped cream and a few banana slices before serving.",
        "Make \"stars\" with whipped cream all around the edge of the pie.",
        "Slice up a banana, and arrange the slices in a flower shape in the center of the pie.",
        "Finish off with a swirl of whipped cream in the middle of the banana flower.",
        "You can make the little star shapes using a piping bag filled with whipped cream and fitted with a spiky decorators tip.",
        "You can also just use the kind of whipped cream that comes i a can with a nozzle.",
        "Serve the pie immediately.",
        "The pie will still taste just as good the next day, but the bananas may turn brown."
