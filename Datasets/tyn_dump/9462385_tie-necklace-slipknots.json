You need a minimum 24 inches (61.0 cm) of cord to fit the necklace over your head. Add more cord if you want the necklace to sit lower around your neck. Next, double the length of cord so there is enough cord to make the knots. Triple the normal amount of cord if you want the knots to sit close together on the necklace. For example, if you start with 24 inches (61.0 cm) of cord, you double that amount to 48 inches (121.9 cm) so you have enough cord.

    "text": " Measuring and Decorating the Cord Use leather or waxed cotton cord. Look for cord that is 1 to 2 millimetres (0.0 to 0.1 in) in width so it is just thick enough to knot.

Position the pendants or beads. Secure a pendant on the cord with a cow hitch knot or a square knot. String beads on the cord and secure them with knots or crimp beads. Add any items to the necklace, before you make knots on the necklace. If you prefer a plain necklace, skip this step. Verify the necklace position. Before tying the knot, hold the ends of the cord together and slide it over your head to confirm you can put it on easily. Then, make sure it sits at a prefered spot around your neck. Keep in mind it will be nearly half its length once you tie the slip knots. Making the Slip Knot Lay the necklace on a flat surface. Place the ends of the necklace on top of the cord, doubling the cord to form 2 layers of cord. Make sure the pendant or beads are at the center of the cord. The ends should run straight up from the pendant or beads. Fold the cord in half 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) from one end. Use your finger to fold the cord, to form a V-shaped mark. The cord marked with the V-shape will be the section that you use to tie the slip knot. Lie the V-shaped fold on top of the straight cord. Hold both pieces of cord with your thumb and forefinger. Keep your thumb on top of the V-shaped mark. You now have 1 straight cord and 2 other short cords formed by the V-fold cord. Form the knot. Take the short end of the V-fold cord and loop it around the 2 other cords. Hold the short cord end and place it behind the other 2 cords. Make sure to loop the end around the other 2 cords away from the V-fold, not towards it. Make sure to loop the end over 2 cords, not 1, as this will result in an incorrect knot. Wrap the V-fold cord 2-3 times around the other cords. Hold your thumb over the V-shaped mark as you wrap the cord around the other 2 cords. Keep the straight cord taut as you wrap, moving down the straight cord. You should have 2-3 nice tight wraps. Remove your thumb and thread the end of the V-fold through the knot. Take your thumb off of the V-fold. Hold the end of the V-fold cord and pass it through the wrapped cord, threading it above the straight cord. Let it hang out of the first wrap you made. Pull the end tight with your fingers to secure the knot. Cut the end with scissors. Once you have tightened the knot, cut off excess cord with scissors. Make the cut right underneath the knot so the end is flush to the knot. This will ensure the knot stays in place and the end does not get caught on anything. Repeat the knot on the other side of the necklace. Follow the same steps to make the second slip knot. Snip off any extra cord on the end once you have finished wrapping and securing the knot.
