Test the door and selector switches with a continuity or multimeter tester. You should also test the timer, motor and motor relay inside your dishwasher. Dishwasher does not Fill or Drains During Filling Confirm that your water supply to the appliance is turned on and there are no leaks between the supply and the dishwasher.  Ensure there are no kinks in the fill lines that are preventing the dishwasher from filling properly. Check the door latch, float assembly, inlet and drain valves.
