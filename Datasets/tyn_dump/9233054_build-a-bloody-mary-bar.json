If you really want to go above and beyond, take the time to drop a few cubes into each glass once all of your guests are accounted for so they won't have to bother with it themselves. If you're expecting a big turnout, it may be easiest to pick up a few bags of ice from the store. Instead of using normal ice cubes, fill your freezer trays with a small batch of Bloody Mary mix. This will prevent your drinks from becoming watered down as they sit."

Place these down the length of the bar so that no one has to fight over who\u2019s next. Place a separate dish or tray under each shaker set to catch drips and spills.
