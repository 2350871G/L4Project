        "Your local post office may have some shipping tubes on hand, but they may not match your measurements.",

        "If you\u2019re shipping a framed or mounted painting, take the wrapped painting and slide it into the frame or mirror box.",
        "Insert it so that it\u2019s completely inside of the box.",
        "There will be a little bit of excess space around the painting inside of the box.",
        "Don\u2019t force the painting into the box or you could damage it.",
        "Slide a rolled-up painting into the shipping tube.",
        "For rolled-up paintings, take the roll that\u2019s wrapped in a layer of bubble wrap and gently slide it into the shipping tube.",
        "Slide it all the way to the bottom of the tube, leaving a small amount of space at the top and around the painting.",
        "Do not place the end cap on the tube until you\u2019ve filled the extra space inside of it.",
        "Use bubble wrap to fill voids in the shipping container.",
