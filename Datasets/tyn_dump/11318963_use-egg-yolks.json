You can use your egg wash to give a golden brown shine, stick 2 pieces of dough together, or make the outside of your baked goods crispy. You can buy a pastry brush online or at any home goods store. Bake your dough according to instructions. Each pastry, bread, or pie has a different baking time, so you should bake yours for however long the recipe specifies. The egg wash will turn your dough a deeper brown than they normally would have been, so make sure that it is baked all the way through. Creating a Custard Boil milk and sugar together in a large pot.

If you have a thermometer, you can check to see when your custard is done when it reaches 185 \u00b0F (85 \u00b0C). Turn off your stove and add 1 ounce (0.028 kg) of butter. Butter thickens the custard and makes it less likely to fall apart while it is cooling. Stir this in gently so that you don\u2019t overwork your custard mix. Add 2 teaspoons (9.9 mL) of vanilla extract. Vanilla extract will give your custard a flavor and make it sweeter. Vanilla is a more neutral flavor that pairs well with other dessert items, but you can also use flavors like almond extract, nutmeg, or fruit zest, like lemon or lime..

(3 g) of salt, and 1 egg yolk by putting your ingredients in a medium bowl and whisk them together until they are smooth, or for about 30 seconds.

It may be helpful to have a partner to pour in the oil while you mix, or vice versa. You can substitute extra virgin olive oil for canola oil if you prefer a more olive taste. Whisk your mixture for about 8 minutes. Your mayonnaise mixture should be thick and stick to your whisk, but still fall off if you lift your whisk out of the bowl. Chill your mayonnaise for about 1 hour. Cover your bowl with plastic wrap or put it in an airtight container and store it in the fridge to chill. This recipe makes about \u20444 cup (180 mL) of mayonnaise and should be eaten within 1 week after you make it. Storing Your Egg Yolks Put your yolks in an airtight container to save for later.
