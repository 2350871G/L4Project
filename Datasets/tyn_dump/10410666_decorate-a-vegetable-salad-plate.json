Designing an Owl Plate Choose a large platter so there is space to create the wings and body. A white plate will make the veggies pop and look even more vibrant, so choose a white or lighter-colored plate if you can. A square, circle, or even rectangular plate will work for your owl. Keep in mind that you can always reload the veggies on the plate when they get eaten if you\u2019re using a smaller platter and have spare veggies ready to go in the fridge. Place 2 small dip bowls where the owl\u2019s eyes will be. Put them about 3/4 of the way up the plate. Place the eyes far enough apart that you will be able to put 2-3 baby carrots between them. Fill the bowls with dip now so that you don\u2019t accidentally spill on your design after you\u2019ve made the owl. You can dip bowls at your local home goods store, or if you\u2019re in a pinch, use spice bowls for the same effect. Use sliced cucumber to create the belly of the owl underneath the eyes.

Make this section round to mimic an owl\u2019s belly. Leave room on the sides to create your wings. If you don\u2019t have cucumbers, you could also use broccoli, cauliflower, or any other veggie you desire. Line the belly with grape tomatoes to create a layer of depth. This just adds an extra element to your design and designates where the belly ends and where the wings will begin. Depending on how big your platter is, make 1 or 2 rows of grape tomatoes. Simply line the entire section of cucumbers with tomatoes, placing them all in the same direction. Set aside 2 tomatoes to use for the owl\u2019s eyes. Create the owl\u2019s wings using long slices of yellow bell peppers. To cut the bell pepper, cut it in half lengthwise, remove the stem and seeds, and then cut it into thin strips. Line each side of the owl with your bell pepper, arranging the slices so that the curved edges are pointing in toward the owl\u2019s belly.

        "Line the belly with grape tomatoes to create a layer of depth.",
        "This just adds an extra element to your design and designates where the belly ends and where the wings will begin.",
        "Depending on how big your platter is, make 1 or 2 rows of grape tomatoes.",
        "Simply line the entire section of cucumbers with tomatoes, placing them all in the same direction.",
        "Set aside 2 tomatoes to use for the owl\u2019s eyes.",
        "Create the owl\u2019s wings using long slices of yellow bell peppers.",
        "To cut the bell pepper, cut it in half lengthwise, remove the stem and seeds, and then cut it into thin strips.",
        "Line each side of the owl with your bell pepper, arranging the slices so that the curved edges are pointing in toward the owl\u2019s belly.",
        "Start layering them right below the dip bowls so they are nearly even with the grape tomatoes and the cucumbers.",
        "Extend the wings out to the edges of the plate for a full-winged effect.",
        "If you have other colors of bell peppers, feel free to create multi-colored wings.",
        "Place baby carrots around the dip bowls to create the face of the owl.",
        "Make the tips of the baby carrots touch the dip bowls to keep them organized and to create the appearance of feathers.",
        "Place a few carrots between the dip bowls to create the nose.",
        "You could also add a few carrots to the bottom of the platter to mimic talons.",
        "Add green pepper ears and red grape tomato eyes to finish the owl.",
        "Use small triangles of green pepper to create 2 ears on top of the owl\u2019s head (just tuck a triangle slightly under the carrots on each side of the head so it\u2019s peeping out), and place a grape tomato into the center of each dip bowl to create the owl\u2019s eyes.",
        "If you don\u2019t have green pepper, you could also use spare cucumber to create the ears.",
        "Creating a Festive Tree Use a rectangular sized platter to create your tree plate.",
        "Depending on what kind of event you\u2019re preparing for, you could match the color of your plate to your other decorations.",
        "White is always a good color because it makes the veggies more vibrant, but orange for Thanksgiving, red for Valentine\u2019s Day, or green or red for Christmas are also nice options.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a rectangular-sized platter, just use whatever you have available.",
        "The rectangular shape lets the tree be taller and have more layers, but you can make it work on any kind of plate.",
        "Place several celery stalks at the bottom of the plate to create the trunk.",
        "Cut these stalks so that each piece is only 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) long.",
        "Make sure to place the trunk in the middle of the bottom of the tray so that you\u2019ll have a proportional looking plate when you\u2019re done.",
        "You can also use pretzel sticks to make the trunk if you prefer.",
        "Create the first layer of the tree with broccoli or another hardy vegetable.",
        "Depending on how large your platter is, make this layer 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) deep and let it extend fully from one edge of the plate to the other.",
        "Make this first layer a long triangle, and try to keep all the edges as even as you can.",
        "For a fun holiday variation, you could make the entire tree out of broccoli and then use other vegetables to create decorations and ornaments all over it.",
        "Alternate rows of veggies, making a tree shape as you proceed.",
        "Use grape tomatoes, sliced bell peppers, baby carrots, cauliflower, sugar snap peas, asparagus, cucumbers, olives, and any other veggies that you like to create the rest of your tree.",
        "As you form each new row, make them a little shorter than the ones before it to mimic the shape of a tree.",
        "Try to keep the edges of each section as even as possible.",
        "Grape tomatoes are a fun option that you can use on top of other layers to create a little more depth to your design.",
        "Try placing several rows of tomatoes throughout your design.",
        "Use grape tomatoes to create the top point of the tree.",
        "Create a row of 3 tomatoes, then 2, and then 1 to form the final point of the tree.",
        "If you have more space to fill, you could always make this section larger.",
        "If you are celebrating Christmas, you could also make a star out of cucumber or another veggie to create a final ornament for the tree."
