The most effective way to eliminate them long-term is to remove these food sources. Every few weeks, give your home another deep cleaning to stem repeat infestations. These beetles often live on food sources you cannot see, such as crumbs and other insects. Vacuum carpeting and use a hose attachment to reach tables and cabinets."

Any food will still have the bugs in it, even if you successfully sterilize it. Throw away these items as soon as you discover them to prevent the beetles from spreading further. You can wrap items in plastic to make sure the beetles don\u2019t escape. Then, seal them inside a garbage bag.
