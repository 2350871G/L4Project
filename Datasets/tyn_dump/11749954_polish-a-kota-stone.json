        "You\u2019ll also be less likely to miss a spot with this technique.",
        "The tracks left behind by the rapidly-spinning polishing pad should make it easy to see which sections you\u2019ve already been over and which ones still require attention.",
        "Fill a spray bottle with water and keep it close at hand while you work.",
        "That way if your surface begins to dry out, you can simply spray it a few times to restore the protective layer of moisture.",
        "Wipe the stone clean with a wet sponge.",
        "Grab your rinsing cloth or sponge again and hold it under the faucet or dunk it in a container of fresh water to saturate it.",
        "Then, run it back and forth over the polished surface from edge to edge.",
        "This second wipedown will help pick up the powdery slurry that\u2019s accumulated on your surface as a result of polishing.",
        "Wring out and rewet your sponge periodically so you\u2019re not just pushing wet dust and grit around.",
        "The best way to clean floors and other large surfaces is to use a wet vacuum with a squeegee attachment.",
        "Allow your surface to air dry completely after wiping it.",
        "This shouldn't take more than a few minutes, in most cases.",
        "Repeat the process one or more times to get a smoother, glossier finish.",
        "When you\u2019re done with your first round of polishing, you have the option of swapping out your polishing pad for one with an even higher grit and doing it all over again.",
        "Carry out your follow-up rounds the same way you did the first, proceeding one small section at a time and finishing with a wipedown with a wet cloth or sponge.",
        "An ultra-fine 11,000-grit pad will work perfectly for subsequent rounds of polishing.",
        "Repeated polishings aren\u2019t a must, but they\u2019re strongly recommended if you want your surface to really sparkle.",
        "If your Kota stone came in a rough finish, it may take as many as 7 rounds with progressively-higher grits to make your surface shine."
