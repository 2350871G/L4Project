Purchasing enough bottles to decorate a bottle tree can be very expensive, so try to reuse as many as you can. You can even make a recycling drive for old glass bottles. Give preference to blue bottles. In the folklore associated with bottle trees, blue is the best color for deterring spirits. Sky vodka bottles can be combined with almost any other color of bottle for a multi-colored bottle tree. Remove the labels. Unless you want to advertise your favorite drink, you can remove the labels by soaking them in a mixture of vinegar and water. Remove stubborn labels with Goo Gone, or a similar orange cleaner. The place where the label was may be sticky so  you should clean it thoroughly until the glue is completely gone. Making a Tree Look for dead or dying trees on your property. Traditionally, bottles were placed over the dead branches of a tree; however, your landscaping will determine if this is possible, or if you need to make a metal tree. Purchase a bottle tree frame if you don\u2019t have time to make one. Garden bottle trees that hold between 10 and 30 bottles are available on Amazon and eBay for $20 to $100. Consider buying a bottle tree from a local steel artist. If you want a statement piece, then investing in an elaborate design will make sense.

Weld your rebar together if you want to. Check that it is sturdy before decorating it. Decorating a Bottle Tree Insert the bottle onto the \u201cbranch\u201d of your bottle tree. It should meet the bottom of the bottle to avoid blowing off in the wind. Decorate evenly. Add a bottle on each side to offset the weight of the bottles. Reinforce the base of the tree if it starts to waver. You may need to cement the tree into place if the ground is not very compact. Add to your bottle tree over time with new bottles.
