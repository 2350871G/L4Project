            "description": "Cars have photographic personalities just like people do. Just as some people will look better photographed from a distance with a telephoto and others will by getting up-close and personal, different cars will look better at different zoom settings. Imagine the car was a person: would you want to exaggerate their facial physical features, or de-emphasise them? Wide angles exaggerate a car's features. Does the car look tough and brutish like a prize-fighter? Then zoom out and get closer to the vehicle. Doing this exaggerates perspective.Don't go too wide unless you know what you're doing; a 28mm-equivalent focal length (18mm on your digital SLR's kit lens) is more than wide enough for most of the time. Getting much wider than that, and you'll end up with a photo of a headlight attached to a very small car (which might even be what you want; keep reading!). {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/00\\/Lifted_Range_Rover_303.JPG\\/460px-Lifted_Range_Rover_303.JPG\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/00\\/Lifted_Range_Rover_303.JPG\\/760px-Lifted_Range_Rover_303.JPG\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":320,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":529.2857142857143,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external free\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.rustyrhinos.com\\/\\\">http:\\/\\/www.rustyrhinos.com\\/<\\/a>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\nLicense: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/2.5\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}  If your car is more of a prize-fighter like this Range Rover than a supermodel, you might want to use a wider angle to exaggerate the vehicle's features.

This is often better for plainer cars, just as longer focal lengths are more flattering to people.

The paintwork (hopefully shiny!) will reflect the sky in parts and so will the windscreen, which are extremely bright relative to other parts of the vehicle. Other than bringing in lighting, there's a few ways around this:\n\nUse a polarizing filter if you have one. This will cut down the reflections. If you don't have one, consider getting one; they're cheap (and the cheap ones work great) and are one of the two filters most critical for digital photography. Bracket your exposures. You'll need a tripod for this to ensure your photographs line up. Take one photograph at a normal exposure, then take another under-exposed. You can do this using the exposure compensation settings in your camera, or automatic exposure bracketing if your camera has it.

Shooting the car from a very low angle (and tilting it up slightly) will give a unique view that isn't normally seen. Get close and specific. Find the more interesting or unique features or curves on the car, then get close-up shots of them from different angles. Take it from the top.

Look at the lighting on the vehicle. Artificial lighting will cast harsh shadows on parts of the car which will need to be filled with your own lighting. You'll get used to these once you can remember that you can see much deeper into the shadows than your camera can. Get your flash off the camera. If it has a built-in flash, then use a compact camera, a camera phone, or any old 1980s flash gun, and quickly run around the vehicle firing the flash to fill in any shadows. (A longer exposure gives you plenty of time to do this, which is another reason to stop down to f/8 or f/11). You might want to drop your photograph down to black-and-white when you're done. Artificial outdoor lighting (especially sodium-vapour) is monochromatic enough that you will probably find that your image is almost black-and-white already once you remove the colour cast from your photograph (a bonus is that this also means you won't have to worry about putting coloured filters over your flash to match the ambient artificial lighting)."

Try to get a shot from high up, or even just holding the camera high above your head. This will both serve as a unique and interesting angle, and allow the photo to capture multiple angles of the car (side, front, top). Try shooting at night under artificial lighting. You'll want a tripod for this one, too, and to either use a remote shutter release or a short self-timer. Stop down to f/8 or f/11. This will turn bright points of light into multi-pointed stars. Make sure your camera's automatic ISO feature is off, and shoot at the lowest ISO setting your camera has. Look at the lighting on the vehicle. Artificial lighting will cast harsh shadows on parts of the car which will need to be filled with your own lighting. You'll get used to these once you can remember that you can see much deeper into the shadows than your camera can. Get your flash off the camera. If it has a built-in flash, then use a compact camera, a camera phone, or any old 1980s flash gun, and quickly run around the vehicle firing the flash to fill in any shadows. (A longer exposure gives you plenty of time to do this, which is another reason to stop down to f/8 or f/11). You might want to drop your photograph down to black-and-white when you're done. Artificial outdoor lighting (especially sodium-vapour) is monochromatic enough that you will probably find that your image is almost black-and-white already once you remove the colour cast from your photograph (a bonus is that this also means you won't have to worry about putting coloured filters over your flash to match the ambient artificial lighting). Take a variety of photos. Used car buyers will want to know as much about the vehicle as they can. Make sure the photos tell a story of your car - five or more photos is the sweet spot. Try cropping really tightly and singling out a single instantly-recognisable feature from the car. This could be a taillight, or a curve on the bodywork, or a crop of quarter of the front grille with a headlight. Edit your photographs with your favourite photo editor. If you don't have one, get one; GIMP is free. Some tricks you might want to try are:\nUse layer masks on an underexposed version of the photo in order to paint in parts of it onto over-exposed parts of your photo (See the information exposure bracketing above). Fix the contrast. More than likely you'll want to increase it. One way which often works brilliantly for cars is to duplicate your image as a layer, set the layer mode to \"Soft Light\", de-saturate it, then adjust the opacity of that layer to taste. This also has the side-effect of fixing colour casts. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/05\\/Porsche_before_and_after_400.jpg\\/460px-Porsche_before_and_after_400.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/05\\/Porsche_before_and_after_400.jpg\\/760px-Porsche_before_and_after_400.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":154,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":253.6813186813187,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>Both shots taken with a Nikon D2H and 55-200mm VR.
