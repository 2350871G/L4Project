If your main line isn't already rigged to your fishing pole, tie one end of it to something sturdy so that you can keep tension as you tie the knot. Wrap the other end of the main line around your hand 5-6 times so that you can keep it taut as you tie the knot. If your pole is already rigged with the main line, lean the rod against a wall to create tension. If you want to have both hands available to tie the knot, you can place the end of the main line in your mouth or step on the other end with your foot."

If you want to have both hands available to tie the knot, you can place the end of the main line in your mouth or step on the other end with your foot. Wrap the lead line around the main line. The leader is the fishing line that you attach your lures to and is connected to the end of your main line. Take the lead line and rest it over the top of the main line.

The leader is typically made of fluorocarbon and is more translucent than your main line. Wrap the lead line around the main line, below the knot. Take the end of the lead line and wrap it around the main line again, but this time wrap it over and around the side of the knot closest to you. Pull the end of the lead line to tighten the 2 coils you created. There should be one coil above the leader and one coil below the leader. Wrap the lead line around the main line 20-22 times. Alternate wrapping the line above and below the knot every time you wrap the lead line around the main line. As you continue wrapping the lead line, you should see the tiny coils of the FG knot start to form. Continue doing this until you\u2019ve created 20-22 coils. Pull the end of the leader after every wrap to keep the knot tight. Securing the Knot and Trimming Excess Line Make 2 looped knots at the end of the FG knot. Pinch the lines at the end of the FG knot with your fingertips so that it doesn\u2019t unravel as you finish securing it. Loop the lead line around both the leader and main line, then pull the end of the leader through the loop you created to make a tight knot at the end of the FG knot. Pull on the end of both the leader and the main line to tighten the knot. Then, tie another knot the same way and pull it tight again. This knot is commonly referred to as a hitch knot.

Cut the line as close as you can to the hitch knot to reduce the likelihood of the knot coming undone. Do not cut the coils of the knot as you do this. Tie 2 more hitch knots at the end the main line. Loop the main line around itself and then pull the end of the line through the loop you created to tie another hitch knot at the end of the FG knot. Repeat the process so that there are 2 hitch knots at the end. This will prevent the loops on the rod from catching on the end of the knot. Cut the excess main line. Pull on both ends of the main line to make the hitch knots tight. Use scissors or a knife to cut the excess main line as close to the FG knot as possible. You now have a strong knot on the end of your line that can easily pass through the rings on your pole.",
