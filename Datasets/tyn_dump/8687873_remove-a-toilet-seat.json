If yours does, open these covers by prying upwards on them with your finger or a screwdriver. Use light pressure when opening the bolt covers. Generally, it takes little pressure to open these, and using too much force may cause damage to them."

                    "description": "You should find a nut screwed onto the threaded end of each bolt. Some nuts may have a shape similar to a wingnut, allowing you to hold it in place by hand. If you have a weak grip, the nut is not wingnut-shaped, or the nut is stuck, try gripping it with a pair of pliers or vice grips. The fasteners of your toilet seat may be plastic. Use light to moderate pressure when removing plastic hardware to keep it from breaking or deforming."

While holding the nut on the threaded end of the bolt, insert your screwdriver into the bolt head and turn it counterclockwise to unscrew the bolt. Screwdrivers that are too small can cause the bolt head to deform, especially if the bolt is plastic. Use the largest size screwdriver that will fit your bolt head for best results."

Spray metal hardware, like nuts and bolts, thoroughly with this oil to lubricate them so you can remove them more easily. Wait about 5 to 10 minutes for the penetrating oil to seep into the narrow spaces of the hardware and break up corrosion. If you don\u2019t have penetrating oil on hand, you can mix together a solution that is 90% vegetable oil and 10% acetone to make your own."

Depending on your situation and the kind of fasteners used to attach the seat, you may want to tape the lid and seat together in a closed or open position. If your situation requires you to cut or drill off bolts to remove the seat, you may want to tape a cover material, like cardboard, in place to protect the porcelain of the toilet and the plastic of the seat as well."

Some toilet designs may require a deep socket or socket extension for you to reach the nut. Turn the socket counterclockwise firmly to break the nut loose. Apply steady moderate force with your socket wrench. If the nut doesn\u2019t loosen, intensify the force on your wrench to high for a very short interval. Do this several times until the nut loosens. If the nut and bolt are already loose, the bolt may turn with the nut when you attempt to loosen it.

This will protect against accidental scratches when you saw. Cut away at the hardware fastening the seat to your toilet a little bit at a time with the hacksaw. This process may take a while. A regular hacksaw will be able to cut through unmoving toilet seat hardware, but a mini one will be easier to use in the narrow space. Depending on the hinge of your toilet seat and the hardware connecting the seat to the toilet, you may have to cut through the hinge mounts and remove the seat with the bolts attached. Then, you can cut through the bolts."

Drill into the bolt with firm, steady pressure where the nut and bolt meet. Drill through the nut completely, then use increasingly larger drill bits to widen the hole. Remove the nut when it comes loose. Save this technique as a last resort because there is a possibility that the drill bit might slip, causing damage to the porcelain or the seat. When you\u2019ve almost drilled through the entire nut, be very careful. Drilling into the porcelain or the seat may cause unsightly damage. Drilled metal may have burrs or jagged edges that can cut you. Handle drilled metal with gloves. Use pliers to try to pull the bolt off.
