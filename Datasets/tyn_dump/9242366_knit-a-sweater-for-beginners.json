        "Work your increases.",
        "You will need to work increases as you continue to knit the sleeve.",
        "This will ensure that the sleeve will get larger as you work up towards the shoulder.",
        "Begin working increases when your sleeve is about 30 rows in total.",
        "Then, work an increase into the edge stitch every four rows as you make your way up to the shoulder.",
        "To increase, knit into the stitch as usual, but do not slip the old stitch off the needle yet.",
        "Knit into the same stitch again by inserting the needle through the back of the stitch instead of through the front of the stitch.",

        "Repeat to create your second sleeve.",
        "After you finish one sleeve, make sure to make a second one.",
        "Make your second sleeve exactly the same way as the first one.",
        "Assembling Your Sweater Thread your yarn needle.",
        "Start by threading your yarn needle with about an arm\u2019s length of thread (around 18 inches).",
        "This will help to ensure that the yarn will not get tangled as you sew.",
        "Make sure to use the same color and type of yarn that you used for your sweater pieces.",
        "Keep in mind that you will need to rethread the needle before sewing each piece of the sweater, so have some yarn ready to go.",

        "Sew together the front and back pieces of the sweater.",
        "Line up the two pieces of your sweater so that the right sides are facing each other and the edges are even.",
        "Remember that these should be identical pieces, so lining up the edges should be easy.",
        "Then, begin sewing from the bottom corner of the sweater on the edge of the six row border you created and up towards the top.",
        "Stop sewing when you reach the armhole space.",
        "Repeat this for both sides of the sweater.",

        "Take one of the sleeves and line it up so that the seam is facing downwards.",
        "Begin sewing where the seam of the sleeve and the seam of the body piece meet.",
        "This will be in the armpit area.",
        "Sew around the sleeve edge to attach the sleeve and close up the armhole.",
        "Repeat this for both sleeves.",
        "Sew up the shoulders to shape the neckline.",
