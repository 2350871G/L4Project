    "text": " Making the Base Poke a hole through a Styrofoam ball. You can do this using a skewer or a long knitting needle. Fold a long piece of wire in half. Cut a long piece of wire that is twice the length of your Styrofoam ball, plus a few extra inches. Fold the wire in half. Thread the wire through the hole. Keep threading the wire until the bent part sticks out from the bottom of the ball by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). This will eventually make the top of your disco ball. Twist the wire into a hanging loop. Widen the bent part of the wire slightly. Push a pencil through the loop. Grip the wire below the pencil with a pair of needle nose pliers. Twist the pencil a few times until the wire twists. Remove the pencil. You can use a pen or paintbrush instead of a pencil. Trim the excess wire. Flip the ball over. Gently tug on the wire until the loop is flush against the top of the Styrofoam ball. Trim the excess wire at the bottom of the ball down to 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) with a pair of wire cutters.

Scratched or cracked CDs are perfectly fine for this project. Real CDs seem to work better than blank ones. You can buy a bunch from a thrift shop.. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Fill a pot with water and set it on the stove. Turn the heat up to high, and let the water come to a boil. You will be dipping the CDs into this water to make them easier to cut.

Discard the squares from the outer edges of the CD; they will have curved edges. Putting it Together Set the ball upside down into a cup or bowl. If you have a small ball, set it upside down into a cup. If you have a large ball, use a bowl instead. This will keep the ball steady as you work. Hot glue your first few tiles around the bottom of the ball. Place a drop of hot glue onto the back of a tile. Quickly press the tile against the bottom of the ball.
