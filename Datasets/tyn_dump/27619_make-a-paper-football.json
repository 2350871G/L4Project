Make sure the edges of the paper match up so that you create a neat vertical crease down its center. Unfold the paper once you've made a defined crease. Pinch the crease with your thumb and index fingers and run them along it to make it more firm. To make the crease even firmer, you can unfold the 2 halves, turn the paper over, and fold them again. This will create a defined crease along both sides of the paper."

Creating the Inside of the Football Fold the lower right corner toward the opposite edge of the paper. This fold should form a triangle.

Now, pull the second fold outward from the square. The end result should be a square (or rectangle) attached to a right-angled triangle. Fold the right-angled triangle downward. Afterwards, you should have 2 connected right-angled triangles that form a larger one. Don't worry if it's not a perfect triangle\u2014it takes practice to get it right. Trim about 1 inch (2.5 cm) off the outer point of the righthand triangle. With the tip of the paper facing downward, draw a line 1 inch (2.5 cm) to mark off the corner piece.
