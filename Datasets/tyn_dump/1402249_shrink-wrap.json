Impulse sealers are some of the most common small-scale shrink-wrapping machines available, and they easily allow you to customize the size and shape of an item to be shrink wrapped. By first choosing the item you need to shrink wrap, you can decide on other specifics. Choose a type of shrink-wrapping film. The two most common shrink-wrap films are polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyolefin. Polyolefin is more durable when it comes to wrapping items with sharp edges, and it has less of an odor when it comes to wrapping food; however, it is also more expensive.
