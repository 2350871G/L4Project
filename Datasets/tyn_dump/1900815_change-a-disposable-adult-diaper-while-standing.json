If the man is uncircumcised, then gently roll back the foreskin before you start wiping the head of the penis. Then, return the foreskin back over the head of the penis. Pay special attention to creases and folds of the person\u2019s skin since these are more prone to infection and skin breakdown if they are left soiled. If the diaper was only soiled with urine, 1 or 2 wipes should be enough to cleanse the area. However, if the diaper was soiled with feces, you may need to use 4 or more wipes to get the person completely clean. If wipes are not sufficient to get the person clean, wet a washcloth under warm (not hot) running water, and then wring out the excess so that the cloth is just damp. Wipe the person\u2019s groin, perineum, and buttocks with the washcloth going from front to back.Tip: Cleansing the person is a good opportunity to check for sores, redness, or other signs of skin breakdown.
