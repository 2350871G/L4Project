The incision should be horizontal\u2013 in other words, perpendicular to the bottle\u2019s length. A 20 fluid ounces (590 ml) bottle works best, but you can use a slightly larger plastic bottle as well.Safety Tip: Take the proper safety precautions when using a utility knife. Cut away from you, keep your hand away from the knife, and use a newer, sharper blade so that you don\u2019t have to apply as much pressure. If you don't feel comfortable using a utility knife, ask an adult for help."
