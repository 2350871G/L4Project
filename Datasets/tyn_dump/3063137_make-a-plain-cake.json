Turn on a stand or hand mixer to medium speed and beat the mixture until it becomes light and fluffy.Tip: To cut back on the sugar, reduce the amount to 1 1/4 cups (250 g) of sugar. Keep in mind that the sugar will help the cake brown, so your reduced-sugar cake may be pale. It's important to use room-temperature butter, which will combine smoothly with the sugar. This will make your cake light and fluffy instead of dense. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl a few times to incorporate all of the butter."
