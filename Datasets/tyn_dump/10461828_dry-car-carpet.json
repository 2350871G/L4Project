    "text": " Getting Rid of Excess Moisture Bring your car into a garage or covered area to keep it dry. Leave your car windows or doors open in an enclosed space to help moisture evaporate.

If you don\u2019t have a shop vac, check with an appliance or hardware store to see if they rent them out for use. Evaporating the Rest of the Moisture Put a fan in your car to generate airflow and evaporate moisture. Place a window unit or standup model fan either in the open car door or right beside it. Allow it to run continuously for at least 2 days, or until the water in your carpet has evaporated. Check it frequently to see the progress of it drying, and move the fan around to have it hit other damp spots after one area has dried considerably. A dehumidifier will also work well in the place of a fan, or speed up the process if used in conjunction with one. Lift the carpet from its sill by the door to help dry the foam underneath.

You can also place socks filled with cat litter or uncooked rice on top of the carpet to help suck up some moisture. Deodorizing and Preventing Mildew Growth Use a vinegar and water solution to clean mildew out of your carpet. Spray the solution and let it sit for 20 minutes. Once it\u2019s done soaking, scrub it with a brush and then dry it up with a towel or shop vac. Repeat the process until the mildew smell begins to lessen in your car. You can also use regular dishwashing soap instead of vinegar, or even a tea tree oil and water mixture. Use 10-20 drops of tea tree oil in a spray bottle with water for a solution. Do a patch test on your carpet before cleaning with it to make sure it won\u2019t stain. Sprinkle borax on any remaining mildew spots in the carpet. Lay down the borax directly on a mildew stain and let it sit for around 10 minutes. Vacuum up the borax, and repeat laying down more if the stain still remains. Borax is a safe solution to use on any surface of your car. Just make sure you vacuum up any you sprinkle around to clean. Make sure everything is dry before putting the sill down or the seats back. Check every surface that was damp to make sure it\u2019s adequately dry before you begin reassembling your car. The foam backing under the carpet needs to be 100% dry, or mildew can still easily grow there. If you\u2019re still smelling mildew, check to see if there isn\u2019t a damp spot you missed.",
