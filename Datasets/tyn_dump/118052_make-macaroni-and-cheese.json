To make this tasty macaroni and cheese dish on the stove, you'll need dry elbow macaroni, salt, vegetable oil, butter, flour, milk, and shredded cheddar cheese.

Then, add salt, pepper, nutmeg, or any other spices you'd like to use until the sauce is perfectly delicious. Stir the sauce more to fully add the seasonings to it.

Add 3/4 of the cheese into the mixture. You'll use the rest of the cheese later. Add salt and pepper to the mixture to taste. Fold the sauce into the macaroni. Now that you've made the sauce, you have to carefully fold the macaroni into the mixture. Place the macaroni in a casserole dish. Put the cheesy mixture in a 2-quart casserole dish.
