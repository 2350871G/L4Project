The only other specialty item you'll need to complete the job is a package of quick-splice connectors, which are usually only a few dollars at the auto part store. The wires are about 16-18 gauge usually, so get connectors of the appropriate size."

Set the cylinder switches to match the number of cylinders in your engine. Replace the end cap of the tachometer carefully to avoid pinching any of the internal tachometer wires. Use a screwdriver to refasten the end cap if necessary. Generally, there will be two switches--a 1 and a 2. Most of the time, both switches should be down for a 4 cylinder engine, while both should be up for an 8 cylinder. In a 6 cylinder engine, most of the time the 2 switch should be up and the 1 should be down. If you get a new tachometer, read the instructions to be sure."
