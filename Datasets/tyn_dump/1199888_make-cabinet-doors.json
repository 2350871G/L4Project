Determine the horizontal rail length by adding the overlay to the length you measured. Determine the vertical stile length by adding the overlay to the height you measured. A panel door consists of 2 stiles, or side pieces, and 2 connecting rails on the top and bottom. The final part is a central panel that fits between everything else. The rails and stiles can be a wide as you desire, so try making them something like 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm). The central panel can be measured later. To determine its size, assemble the rails and stiles first, then measure the distance between them. For a basic cabinet, you could start with 1 ft \u00d7 3 ft (0.30 m \u00d7 0.91 m) or 1 ft \u00d7 4 ft (0.30 m \u00d7 1.22 m) hardwood boards.

Another option is to use 100-grit sandpaper to wear down the wood and also eliminate rough edges. Secure the boards together with wood glue after inserting the central panel. Take apart the frame to expose the grooves you made on the rails. If you are able to, use a squeezable bottle to make the glue easier to apply. After adding glue all along the grooves, fit the door pieces back together. Place a couple of bar clamps on the ends to keep everything squeezed together for about 24 hours. Dripping glue into the grooves is useful for reducing the amount of excess glue you have to clean up. If you have a spreadable glue, use a paint brush to coat the tongues and edges of the central board instead. Make absolutely sure the cabinet parts fit well together! Once the glue dries, they won\u2019t be easy to fix. Repeat the process to make more doors for the cabinets. Start with fresh material to cut and assemble the same way. Keep in mind that your cabinets may require different door sizes. Remember to measure the openings and cut the plywood to compensate for these differences. Finishing and Attaching Doors Sand the door if you plan on painting or staining it. MDF can be painted or stained just like wood. Use 220-grit sandpaper to abrade the entire door. Rub the entire door down with a gentle but consistent amount of pressure. The sandpaper slightly scuffs up the finish so paint adheres to it better. Most MDF doors are painted instead of stained. MDF doesn\u2019t have fibers like wood does, so it doesn\u2019t stain as well. You don\u2019t have to do either if you prefer the way the door looks. Paint MDF to give it a colorful but damage-resistant finish. Keep your dust mask and protective goggles on while painting. Brush the paint over the entire door in a single, consistent layer. After letting that layer dry, flip the door over to paint the other side. You may need to add 2 or 3 layers to perfect the finish. Latex and oil-based paints are good options for cabinets. Usually, latex is preferable since it\u2019s very water-resistant and dries much quicker. Oil-based paints are a little more expensive but can be more durable in the long-run. Let the paint dry after each subsequent layer. Paint can take 8 hours or longer to dry completely. Refer to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for more specific information. Stain wood if you wish to make it darker and water-resistant. In addition to your dust mask and goggles, put on rubber gloves. Wood stainer is like a gel that you can apply over wood with a foam brush or rag. Rub it into the wood in a single layer to work it into the grain, coloring it. After it dries, flip the door over to finish the other side. Note that you may need to add several layers of stainer to bring the door to the color you desire. It\u2019s best to add small amounts at a time to avoid darkening the door too much. MDF doesn\u2019t have wood fibers, so it isn\u2019t great when stained. Although it can be stained, the finish often doesn\u2019t look as good as it would with authentic wood. Install hinges to attach the door to the cabinet frame. Use a pair of cabinet hinges, placing them near the top and bottom along one of the door\u2019s longer edges. Hinges screw directly into the door and frame. The screws will be included with the hinges. Tighten them, then check that the door opens and closes properly to finish. Note that there are several types of hinges you can choose from. Butt hinges are the common type you see on most doors, but there are also long European-style hinges that are easier to use for adjusting the door\u2019s placement They are all installed the same basic way. Screw the hinges to the cabinets to install the doors. Fit the door onto the frame, making sure the hinges are an equal distance from its top and bottom. Mark the hinge location on the frame as needed. Once you\u2019re sure the door is where you want it, begin screwing it in place. Most hinges come with screws to be used with a Phillips screwdriver.",
