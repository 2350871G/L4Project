        "Use a piping bag or a small spoon to fill the cups.",
        "These cups are really small, so you won't be able to fill them with large amounts of dessert or ice cream.",
        "You can turn them into mini pies and desserts, however.",
        "Ideal fillings include:\nCustard or pudding\nMousse\nNo-bake cheesecake\nWhipped cream and a sliced strawberry Indenting After Baking Choose your favorite drop cookie recipe.",
        "There are two types of cookies: the type that you roll out and cut into shapes, and the type that you roll into balls and drop onto a baking sheet.",
        "Choose a cookie recipe where you roll the dough into balls and drop onto a baking sheet.",

        "Scoop the dough into the greased muffin tin.",
        "You can do this with a large cookie scoop or with an ice cream scoop, but make sure that each well has the same amount.",
        "The cookie dough will spread out in the wells and fill them.",
        "Don't indent anything yet; you'll do that at the end.",
        "Bake the cookie cups for about 15 to 16 minutes.",
        "Keep in mind that the exact baking times may vary depending on the recipe that you used.",
        "The cookie cups are ready when the edges start to turn brown.",

        "You can use just about any type of cookie dough recipe for this method, but the kind that works the best is the roll-out-and-cut kind.",
        "Avoid using the type of dough where you have to roll onto balls and plop onto a baking sheet; they will spread too much and make a mess.",

        "Do not preheat the oven yet.",
        "Most kinds of roll-out cookie dough recipes have a chill period.",

        "Drape the cut dough circles over the prepared muffin tin.",
        "Only drape the dough over the wells that are covered with aluminum foil.",
        "Gently press the dough against the sides of each well.",
        "It won't reach the bottom of the tray, which is fine; the dough will spread during baking.",
        "Again, you are draping the dough over the back of the tin, not the inside.",
        "Keep the cookie cups staggered.",
        "You don't want them touching.",
        "This will prevent fusing.",
        "Chill the tin in the freezer while you prepare the other one.",
        "Once you have finished draping the size cookie dough circles over the back of your muffin tin, put the entire tin into the freezer.",
