If the ceiling above your porch has joists, exposed beams, or any other structural elements with cracks running between them, you may want to make the bench a length that will allow you to center the anchors for hanging the swing between the cracks. Consider how deep the seat and how tall the back will be. Measure the seat and back of a similar chair that you feel comfortable in (e.g. a dining chair). The swing built over the course of these instructions is 20 in. (508 mm) deep in the seat and 18 in. (457 mm) tall in the backrest, which is comfortable for a fairly tall individual but may not be as comfortable for a person with shorter legs.

Cedar, fir, cypress, juniper, or even birch will work equally well as long as the components are thick and strong enough to support the weight they will carry, though redwood would be the best choice for many projects. Avoid using treated yellow pine. Gather all the tools, fasteners, and lumber you need for the project.

A pair of metal sawhorses with a sheet of plywood work great as a makeshift table, but any flat surface that provides a workspace at a comfortable working height will do. Measuring and Cutting Measure and cut seven 2x4 in. (50x100 mm) boards the length you want the finished swing to be. The 2x4 used in this article is 5 feet (1.5 m) (152 cm) long. Cut these boards to length, being careful to make all cuts square (90 degrees) if you are laying all the boards together to cut them at once. Set blocks on the table to support the boards. Next, attach a stop for keeping them from sliding while you rip them to width. If you have a table saw, you can use this for ripping the slats instead. Rip the cut boards into slats for the seat and back. The seat slats need to be 3/4 in. (19 mm) wide, while the back slats (which support less weight) only need to be 3/4 in. (19mm) wide.

Locate the height you want the armrest on the back frame, then locate the position you want the support on the seat portion of the frame. Attach these with 3 in. (7.5 cm) #12 wood screws. Fasten through the top of the armrest down into the support board with two more wood screws. Drill a hole through the armrest support and the seat frame for the eyebolt. The eyebolt will attach your swing chain to the swing. Then, drill through the back frame for another eyebolt for the back chain. Screw in the eyebolts, place washers over the backs (to keep the nuts from drawing into the wood frame), and tighten the nuts over the ends with a wrench. Locate the position and height of your swing. Install eyebolts or eye-screws on a solid board for the overhead connection, and measure the length you will need your chains to hang your swing. You may find you need to adjust the chains to get the swing tilted back the proper amount to be comfortable for you.",
