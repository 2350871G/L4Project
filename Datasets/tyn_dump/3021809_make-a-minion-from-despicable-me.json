    "text": " Making a Toilet Paper Roll Minion Gather your supplies. This minion uses a toilet paper roll as a base. It is simple and easy to make, and perfect for anyone who loves to work with glue and paint. Here's what you will need:\nToilet paper roll\nBlue and yellow paint\nBlack and yellow paper\nBlack marker\n1 \u2013 2 large googly eyes\nGlue\nPaintbrushes\nNewspaper\nMasking tape or paper tape\nBlack yarn or pipe cleaners Stuff a toilet paper roll with crumpled up newspaper. This will make your minion nice and solid. If you cannot find a toilet paper roll, try cutting a paper towel roll in half, or into thirds. Crumple up some newspaper into a ball and stick it on top of the toilet paper roll. This will make the domed shape of the minion's head. Cover the newspaper dome with masking tape. This will cover the top of the head and make it smooth. Keep covering it with tape from different angles until you can't see the newspaper anymore. Make sure that you are using masking tape or paper tape, or the paint won't stick to it. Regular scotch tape is too smooth. Paint the top half yellow and the bottom half blue and allow the paint to dry. The yellow part will be the body of the minion and the blue part will be the overalls. Finish painting the overalls once the paint has dried. Use a thin brush to paint two \"n\" shapes across from each other, right above the blue part of the tube. This will make the straps. Draw the feet on a sheet of black paper. Start by placing the minion down on a sheet of black paper. Trace around the minion using a pencil. Take the minion off the paper and draw an \"m\" right above the circle. Make sure that the bottom of the \"m\" is touching the top of the circle. Also, make sure that the \"m\" is the same width as the circle. The arches from the \"m\" will make the shoes. Cut the circle out; be sure to include the \"m\" shape. Glue the minion down onto the feet. Use school glue or tacky glue to line the bottom rim of the toilet paper roll. Place a few drops of glue onto the newspaper inside the minion as well. Press the minion down onto the feet. The arches from the \"m\" should be sticking out from under the minion, like shoes. Draw two arms on yellow paper and cut them out. If you want, you can paint or color the hands black to look like gloves. Minion arms are shaped like long, skinny rectangles; they have three loops at one end, sort of like a three-leaf clover. Glue the arms onto the minion. Fold the bottom of each arm by 1 centimeter. Put a drop of glue onto the folded part, and press it against the minion, just below the shoulder strap. Make the goggles. Glue one or two large googly eyes down for the eyes. Use a marker to draw around each eye. This will make the frame of the goggles. Next, use a marker to draw a line going around the entire head, from one side of the goggles to the other. This will be the strap. If your minion has two eyes, make sure that the googly eyes are touching each other. Minion eyes are very close together. Glue some yarn or pipe cleaners onto the top of the head to make the hair. Cut some yarn, and glue it onto the top of the head. If you want your minion to have spiked hair, cut a pipe cleaner into 1 inch (2.54 centimeter) pieces, and poke them onto the top of the minion's head. If they don't go in too easily, make the hole first using a toothpick. Add the face and other details. Use a black marker to draw the mouth. You can also use it to draw the buttons and pocket on the overalls. In the movie, the minions had a letter \"G\" on the front pocket of the overalls. You can use that, or use the first letter of your name to make the minion your personal minion. Making a Sock Minion Gather your supplies. This minion requires a bit of sewing, but it is cute and squishy once finished. Here's a list of what you will need:\nBanana-yellow sock\nBlue sock\nTeddy bear stuffing\nNeedle and thread\nScissors\nGoogly eyes\nYarn\nBlack buttons\nBlack and grey felt\nBlack yarn\nFabric glue Purchase two pairs of socks. You need a bright yellow sock, the color of a banana. You will also need a blue sock. Measure from the toe of the yellow sock down to where the heel begins and cut it. You will be using the toe/foot part to make the minion's body. Save the top part for later; you will need that to make the arms. Fill the sock with teddy bear stuffing and sew it close with a running stitch. Make the running stitch about 1 centimeter away from the cut hem. Gently pull on the thread to close the sock and tuck the raw edges inside. If the stuffing starts to come out, poke it back in with your finger. Tie the thread off in a knot and cut it. Cut the toe off of the blue sock. How long you make it will depend on how large you want the overalls to be. Most minions' overalls stop about half-way up their body. Cut two half circles out of the blue sock, one from each side. Measure down 1 centimeter from the top part of the sock. Cut a small half circle along the folded part. Repeat this for the other side. This will make the arm holes/shoulder straps of the overalls. Pull the overalls onto your minion's body and secure it with fabric glue. Draw a thin line of glue along the top, inside edge of the overalls, as well as around each arm hole. Tug the overalls on, and press the top edge of the blue sock down onto the minion's body. If the edges of the overalls keep popping up, pin them down with some sewing pins. You can remove the pins once the glue dries. Draw and cut out the arms. Start by drawing two minion arm shapes on the top part of the yellow sock and cut them out; be sure to cut through both layers of the sock so that you end up with four pieces. Sew the arms together and stuff them. Pin the right sides together of each arm. Sew around the edges; try to keep the seam allowance as small as possible. Be sure to leave the narrow bottom part of the arm open. Turn each piece inside out, and fill it with teddy bear stuffing. A minion arm is shaped like a skinny rectangle. The hand is shaped like 3 loops, sort of like a 3-leaf clover. Draw and cut out the feet. Cut two L shapes out of the top part of the blue sock. The back/straight part of each L should be on the fold of the sock. You will end up with two pieces. Sew the feet and stuff them. Pin wrong sides together of each L shape. You should end up with two Ls, but that have the fuzzy side of the sock showing. Sew around each L shape. Try to keep the seam-allowance as small as possible. Leave the top part of each foot/L shape open. Turn each L shape inside out and fill it with stuffing. Stitch the arms and feet on. The arms will go onto the minion's body, just beneath the shoulder straps. You can make them stick straight out, like a T, or you can have them hanging down by the minion's sides. The feet will go onto the bottom of the minion. The toes should be pointing towards you. Try to use the ladder-stitch while doing this to make it as seem-less as possible. Decorate the overalls. Use fabric glue to attach a small, black button to the front of each shoulder strap. Cut a square from the left-over blue sock, and glue it down onto the front of the overalls to make the pocket. Use a fabric marker to draw the stitching, pockets, and the initial. In the movies, the minions had a letter \"G\" on the front of their pockets. You can draw a \"G\" too, or you can make it your own minion and draw the first letter of your name instead. Make the goggles using grey felt and googly eyes. Cut two circles out of grey felt that are a little bit larger than the googly eyes you are using. Use Put a drop of fabric glue onto the back of each eye, then press each eye down onto the grey felt circles. Then, use fabric glue to attach the felt circles to the minion. If your minion has two eyes, make sure that the felt circles are touching. Glue down a thin strip of black felt for the goggle strap. Place a thin line of fabric glue all around the head, going from one side of the goggles to the next. Press the felt down onto the glue. Cut pieces of black yarn to make the hair, and attach it to the minion's head using fabric glue. You can cut the yarn however long you want it. If you want your minion to have spiky hair, tie knots at the end of the yarn pieces, and glue the bottom of the knot to the top of the head. Color in the mouth, gloves, and shoes with a black fabric marker. Minions make many silly faces, so you can draw the mouth however you want. When you are done making the face, use the marker to color in the hands; this will be the minion's gloves. Then, use the marker to color in the bottom part of the feet. This will be the shoes. Remember, minions don't have noses or eyebrows. Making a Kinder Surprise Egg Minion Gather your supplies. The yellow capsules that come inside Kinder Surprises almost look like minions.
