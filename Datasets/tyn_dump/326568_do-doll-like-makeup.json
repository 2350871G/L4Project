Use foundation that matches your skin tone, or is just one shade lighter. Feel free to apply foundation makeup a little thicker than you would normally, as the doll look features a porcelain or plastic face that is unlike natural skin. Add concealer to any blemishes, red patches, or dark circles under the eyes so that your face color is completely even."
