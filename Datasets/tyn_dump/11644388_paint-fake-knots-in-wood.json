The ink will immediately begin spreading out over the wood in a rough circular shape. You\u2019ll find alcohol ink at any major craft store, as well as some home improvement centers. For maximum realism, choose an ink in a color that matches the tone of the wood you\u2019re painting. Dark brown inks will work best for medium-to-dark woods such as oak and walnut, whereas light-to-medium shades will appear more natural on brighter woods like birch, ash, and pine.Tip: Wear gloves and set up your materials in a well-ventilated space. Both the isopropyl alcohol and special dyes used to make alcohol inks could cause skin and airway irritation, if you\u2019re not careful."
