        "For flexible hose connections, consider using a separate metal clamp to cinch the discharge tube to the disposal valve.",
        "Trim the discharge tube as needed.",
        "If you\u2019ve upgraded to a larger disposal or one of a different model, there\u2019s a good chance that the discharge tube won\u2019t be the right length to connect to the ground plumbing valve.",
        "Fortunately, this is a simple fix\u2014mark the spot on the tube where it should line up with the drain pipe, then cut it to size with a hacksaw.",
        "It should be a perfect fit.",

        "Run water through the disposal to check for leaks.",
        "Turn on the faucet and let it run for 15-20 seconds.",

        "Assuming the individual components are nice and snug, you shouldn\u2019t have any problems.",
        "Patch up any minor leaks you find using a strip of thread seal tape or a line of Teflon pipe joint compound.",
