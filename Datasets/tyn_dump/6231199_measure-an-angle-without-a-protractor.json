        "Since a reflex angle is an angle of more than 180 degrees, you relate it as a portion of a circle.",
        "The degrees of the reflex angle and the degrees of the smaller acute angle would add up to 360.",
        "To continue the example, if the smaller acute angle measures 26.565 degrees, the reflex angle would measure 333.435 degrees."
