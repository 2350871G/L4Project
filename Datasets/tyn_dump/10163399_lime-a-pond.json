If the soil from your pond tests out to just over 6, it will be up to you whether you want to go ahead and add lime or wait and test it again later.

        "When it drops to 6 or lower, it will be time to apply a new course of lime.",
        "The best time to treat your pond is in the fall or winter, when any water fertilizers you may have used during the spring or summer will have dissipated.",
        "That way, you can be sure they won\u2019t interact negatively with the lime.",
        "You can also add roughly a quarter of the amount of lime you used originally each year to maintain the proper balance, although this will require a lot more work.",
        "Adding Lime on Your Own Dilute the lime in water before adding it to your pond.",
        "Fill a wheelbarrow, steel drum, or group of large buckets with fresh water, then shovel in the lime a little at a time.",
        "The lime will dissolve gradually, forming a solution that disperses more easily (and evenly) than that in lump or granulated form.",
        "Always wear thick gloves, eye protection, and a respirator or facemask anytime you\u2019re handling raw lime.",
        "If for some reason you\u2019re unable to dilute your lime, it will be necessary to pile it onto a plywood platform or outstretched tarp at your application site.",
        "Spread the lime outward from a boat or dock.",
        "Pour or pump the lime solution into the water in a 360 degree arc, starting from as close to the center of the pond as possible.",
        "It won\u2019t take long for it to make its way to the outer edges, eventually diffusing through the entire body of water.",
        "Adding the lime radially from the middle of the pond is far more effective than dispersing it from the banks.",
        "Shovel the lime into the water from the banks.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a boat or dock available to aid in application, your only option will be to work your way slowly around the perimeter of the pond.",
        "Try to stop and dump in a small amount of lime solution at consistent intervals, similar to the way you would shock a swimming pool.",
        "A few passes with a bucket and shovel may be the most convenient way to treat especially small ponds.",
        "Only apply lime manually from outside large ponds as a last resort.",
        "It takes significantly longer to impact water quality this way, and much of the material often ends up soaking into the soil around the banks and being wasted.",
        "Avoid using more than 200kg of lime at one time.",
        "This is the maximum upper limit for how much lime can be added in a single application.",
        "Unloading more than 200kg per day could cause the alkalinity of your pond to spike, upsetting both the chemical balance of the water and the wellbeing of the plants, fish, and beneficial microorganisms it contains.",
        "Check the pH of the water at the end of the day to make sure it's still within safe limits.",
        "Alkalinity levels higher than about 9-9.5 can be enough to kill off fish and other large aquatic creatures."
