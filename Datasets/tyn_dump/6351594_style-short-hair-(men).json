The crew cut is an extremely common haircut where the sides are cut extremely short and there\u2019s a little more hair left on top. Since you can\u2019t do much with the sides, styling a crew cut comes down to adjusting the hair on top. Comb your hair back on top for an undercut-look. For a trendier look, take a fine-tooth comb and place the teeth directly underneath your hairline in front. Comb your hair directly to the back on top. Comb the top section of your head straight back and comb the sides down for a vintage undercut style. Run your hair to the center for a pseudo-mohawk. To give your crew cut a little attitude, scoop a quarter-sized drop of product into your hands. Put both hands on top of your head inside the part. Use your fingers to rub your hair on both sides up and towards the center. Squeeze the crown of your hair together to set it in place.Tip: You can use a flat iron to singe the tips together in the middle if you want a really defined look that will keep its shape longer. Rub your hair upwards in the front for more volume. If you want to add a little volume without making too much of a statement, take a comb or brush and style the top of your head forward. With the top of your head brushed or combed forward, take your hand and run it up through the top of your head in the front. Pull the hair near your hairline up with your fingers and make minor adjustments by hand to give your hair some shape. This will give your hair a little volume without making it look overly-styled. Go for a messy bed head look by rubbing your hair randomly. For a laid-back bed head look, simply use your hands to rub the top of your head and mess your hair up. Then, once your hair is all over the place, make minor adjustments by hand or with a soft-bristled brush to adjust the hair as you please. If you want to set your messy look in place, use a sculpting spray to set it in place.",
