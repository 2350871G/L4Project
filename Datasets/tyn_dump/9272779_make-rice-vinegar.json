Place the rice, along with any leftover cooking water, in an airtight glass or stoneware bottle or jar. If you use a glass jar or bottle, opt for a dark style because it will allow for better fermentation."

If you have homemade rice vinegar that hasn\u2019t been filtered, you can scoop the Mother off the top and add 1 to 2 fluid ounces (30 to 59 ml) of it to the rice. If you don\u2019t have Mother Vinegar, add the same amount of rice wine to the rice instead. Making the vinegar with wine takes longer, but the process is still effective. You can purchase Mother Vinegar from a variety of online retailers. Shaoxing rice wine is a good option for making rice wine vinegar. You can usually find it at Asian markets."

If it smells like vinegar, taste it to check for the right flavor. If it hasn\u2019t turned to vinegar yet, recover the container and let it set again. It\u2019s normal for the vinegar to have strange odors during the fermentation process. The smell you should be looking for is the sharp, acidic scent of store-bought vinegar. The flavor should be sour, tart, and acidic like store-bought vinegar. It shouldn't taste like alcohol."

Its taste will change the longer that you allow it to ferment, so it's really a matter of personal taste when to stop. If you don't want a sharply acidic vinegar, you may want to allow it to ferment a little longer."
