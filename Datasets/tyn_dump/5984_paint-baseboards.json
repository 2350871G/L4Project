Additionally, pads are usually the same width as common baseboards, so you can paint the width of the baseboard (from top to bottom) with one stroke. This will also minimize the amount of paint that drips off the trim as you paint. Visit a home-improvement store for a good selection of supplies. You can also purchase the necessary supplies to paint your baseboards at a painting store."

Oil-based paints also dry slower than latex or water-based paints, giving you more time to paint. Choose whatever color you like: some homeowners prefer white baseboards, while others like baseboards that match the walls.
