This process requires getting on the roof in a beekeeper\u2019s outfit and leaning down into the chimney. Even if you anchor yourself properly, you could get stung and potentially fall from the roof.

Bees always have fur, while wasps and hornets have smooth exteriors. In addition, hornets and wasps have longer, thinner thoraxes while bees tend to be round. If you have hornets or wasps in your nest, call an exterminator and seal your chimney immediately. Hornets and wasps can be very aggressive towards humans, and if they think your home is their home, you could have a nasty situation on your hand. If you have an allergy to bees, do not get close to them. Bees are typically non-aggressive, but they may sting if they think you\u2019re trying to harm them."

Slowly raise it up towards your roof while monitoring the screen. If there are lots of little dots flying around, you have bees. If there is a large, white mass on the screen, you have a hive. An infrared camera will cost around $50-80 to rent for a day. If the bees haven\u2019t established a hive, it will cost considerably less to have the bees removed. The contractor will likely use a vacuum to extract the bees and take them elsewhere. This will usually cost anywhere from $50-200. If you have an established hive, it will cost a little more.

This is the best way to keep bees, wasps, or hornets from flying down into your home. The damper, which is the hatch that closes the opening to the chimney, is not nearly enough to keep bees out. They can usually squeeze through the opening between the plates. Chimney plugs are also known as balloon plugs. Alternatively, hold a contractor\u2019s bag over the chimney and press long lengths of duct tape into the seam where the bag meets the masonry. Then, add more tape along the groves in the grout so it overlaps the seam where the first layer of tape meets the masonry. Do this 2-3 times to create an airtight fit.
