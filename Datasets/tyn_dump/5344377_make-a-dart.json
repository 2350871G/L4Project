It might be easier to do this if the milk jug is on its side instead of standing upright. Push a plumb bob into the center. Carefully and quickly press the pointed end of a plumb bob into the center of this soft spot. This should form a dimple in the plastic.

Use scissors or a sharp knife to carefully cut away the side of the jug with the dimpled cone on it. If you plan to make several darts, you should make several of these cones in the same manner before you cut out the wall of plastic.

        "The wood is sturdy enough and the thickness of the skewer is just the right size.",
        "Sharpen the tip of the skewer.",
        "Carefully whittle or shave of portions of wood from the opposite end of the skewer to form the end into a point.",
        "The actual point only needs to be 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm ) long.",
        "Note that if you want a smaller dart, you should trim the skewer down to size before sharpening the end to a point.",
        "Wedge a length of string into the split.",
        "Take a length of string 2 feet (61 cm) long and wedge one end of the string into the split in the back of the skewer.",
        "The string should be roughly the same thickness as floss.",
        "Linen string, kite string, and yucca fiber are all good options.",
        "Leave 1 inch (2.5 cm) of string hanging out from one side of the split.",
        "The remaining length of string should hang out from the opposite side.",
        "Position the cotton on the back of the dart.",
        "Grab the split end of the dart with your non-dominant hand and hold the stretched cotton fibers on top of it.",
        "The cotton should extend over the top 2 inches (5 cm) or so of the wooden shaft.",
        "Note that this process will take some balance.",
        "You will need to hold the center of the wooden skewer with your dominant hand while holding the long end of the string in between your teeth.",
        "Wrap the string around the cotton.",
        "Spin the wooden skewer away from you using your dominant hand, working slowly.",
        "The string should wind itself around the cotton and the skewer.",
        "You will probably need to insert cotton fibers beneath the string as it winds around the skewer.",
        "Do this using your non-dominant hand and work with a few fibers at a time.",
        "Continue until there are 2 inches (5 cm) of cotton fletching wrapped around the dart.",
        "The winding process takes time and practice to master, so don't be discouraged if you don't get it right the first time.",
        "Tie off the string.",
        "Wrap the string around the bottom of the fletching several times.",
        "Tie it into a knot, then tie another knot over it.",
        "If done right, this should secure the cotton fletching in place.",
        "Secure the knot with glue.",
        "Apply a dot of super glue or hot glue over the knot to add another layer of security.",
        "Smooth out the fletching.",
        "Twirl the cotton fletching in between your fingers to \"fluff\" it, then use your fingers to smooth it back down.",
        "If necessary, you can trim excess cotton with scissors or a sharp knife.",
        "Once you finish smoothing out cotton, the dart is ready to use.",
        "Method Three: Paper Dart[5]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source\n\t\t\n[6]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source Cut out a square of paper.",
        "Measure out a 3-inch (7.6-cm) square on a sheet of standard printer paper and cut it out.",
        "Use a ruler to make sure that each side is straight and equal in length.",
        "Another option is to use a standard square sticky note.",
        "Roll the paper into a cone.",
        "Start at one corner and roll the paper square into itself, forming a small cone.",
        "Apply even pressure as you roll the paper to form a tight cone.",
        "You may need to apply a small strip of tape to the outer edge of the cone so that it holds its shape as you continue to work.",
        "Cover the cone in tape.",
        "Cover the entire outer side of the cone with a single layer of tape.",
        "Start at the tip and work your way up.",
        "You can use standard office tape or duct tape.",
        "Covering the cone in tape makes it more durable.",
        "This action also gives the cone more weight, which will give the dart more weight.",
        "The additional weight can help the dart fly better.",
        "Snip away the tip of the cone.",
        "Use scissors to cut a small round hole at the very tip of the cone.",
        "The hole only needs to be large enough to allow a nail to just barely slip through.",
        "If the hole is too large, however, the nail can wobble around or fall out.",
        "Slide the nail through it.",
        "Side the nail through the paper cone, pushing the pointed end through from the inside of the cone.",
        "Slide the cone down the length of the nail, leaving roughly 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of space in between the head of the nail and the inner tip of the cone.",
        "Use a 11.5 gauge nail that is 2.5 inches (6.35 cm) long.",
        "It also needs to have a round head.",
        "If the opening in the cone is too small, make it a little bigger.",
        "Do not allow the nail to tear through it.",
        "If the nail can fall out of the cone on its own, however, the hole is too wide and you should start over.",
        "Glue the nail in place.",
        "Apply a small dot of super glue just below the head of the nail.",
        "Slide the cone down the remaining section of nail, into the glue and on top of the nail head.",
        "Pull carefully yet firmly to make sure that the glue adheres to the cone.",
        "Allow the glue to dry before you continue.",
        "Adhere six perler beads to the nail.",
        "Apply a thin dot of super glue to the cone side of the nail, then slide a total of six perler beads onto the nail and into the glue.",
        "The perler beads add weight to the dart.",
        "This weight can make the darts more stable, which improves their ability to fly.",
        "These beads should be fitted next to the cone and along the middle of the nail so that they remain visible.",
        "Alternate back and forth between applying glue and slipping beads on.",
        "If you have difficulty getting the beads on using your fingers, you may need to slide them on using pliers.",
        "Let dry before use.",
        "Allow the glue to dry completely.",
        "Once it dries, the dart is ready to throw."
