Figure out which sound best defines the band you hope to be in. Ask yourself what genres you enjoy playing the most and who you hope your target audience will be. Will your audience rock out while doing mosh pits? Will your audience be mellow and sway to your songs as you play in tiny coffee shops? Decide on the instruments you will have to use. A good start: lead guitar, rhythm guitar, bass, and drums. You may want a keyboardist, sax, or brass, depending on what sort of music you'll be wanting to play.
