Taking shallow breaths uses only the air in your lungs, which causes you to run out of air quicker than you want. This makes the muscles in your throat tense up, which puts strain on your voice and prevents it from carrying to your audience. Instead, you should be taking deep breaths using your diaphragm."

The only thing that should be moving is your stomach as you inhale and exhale. If your shoulders and chest rise when you inhale, you are breathing using only your lungs, which prevents proper projection."

There are several ways to practice breathing skills. Yawn to open your chest and larynx. Big yawns help us open up our chest to facilitate a deep breath. Stretch your torso while you do it, and make big vowel sounds as you expel the breath to practice projecting as you speak. Laugh. There's a reason a good laugh is referred to as a \u201cgut buster.\u201d Laughing is a function performed by diaphragm, and is a fun way to practice the deep breaths necessary to project your voice. Laugh heartily, using big open vowel sounds as you expel your breath. Alternatively, laugh with your mouth closed. This makes it harder to use only the breath in your chest so you learn to utilize the diaphragm instead. Count or say whole sentences in a single breath. The higher the number you reach or the longer the sentence, the more you will need to use your diaphragm to support it."
