        "Write \u201cpiggy bank\u201d or something along those lines on the jar and keep it in a safe location.",
        "The great part about using a mason jar is that you can constantly track how much money you\u2019re saving without opening the jar.",
        "You want your jar to be safe, but be sure to keep it in a part of your home that\u2019s easy to access.Tip: Tape the lid shut to discourage people from opening the jar before it\u2019s full Decorate your jar any way you\u2019d like.",
        "There are a number of ways to go about this step, as it\u2019s completely up to you how you want your piggy bank to look!",
        "One fun idea is to wrap a colorful, decorative tape called washi tape around your jar and then add stickers to the parts of the jar that aren\u2019t covered.",
        "Then, take some puffy paint and draw your name or other designs onto the glass jar.",
        "You can buy washi tape, stickers, and puffy paint at your local crafts store or get order some online.",
        "Add the tape and stickers onto the jar before the puffy paint.",
        "Then, once you\u2019ve painted, let the jar sit for 6 hours so it can dry completely.",
        "Working with Papier-M\u00e2ch\u00e9 Mix flour and glue together in a pot.",
        "Get a small pot that holds around 0.5 gallons (1.9 L) to boil water.",
        "Then, get a medium-sized pot that can hold at least 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water and is about 8 inches (20 cm) in diameter.",
        "This is your paste-mixing pot.",
        "Whisk together 1 cup (240 mL) of flour and 1 cup (240 mL) of water thoroughly in your paste-mixing pot.",
        "Boil 4 cups (950 mL) of water on the stove in your smaller pot and stir the flour and water mixture into it.",
        "Let it simmer for about 3 minutes, and then let it cool for 15 minutes.",
        "Ask an adult to help you use the stove.",
        "You can purchase mixable papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 paste at arts and crafts supply stores, but it\u2019s easy to make your own at home.",
        "You\u2019ll also save some money in the process!",
        "Crumple newspaper twice to prepare it for papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9.",
        "Get a few sheets of newspaper and some brown paper bags.",
        "Crumple them up into tight balls, uncrumple them, and then do the same thing again.",
        "This helps the glue soak into the paper more thoroughly.",
        "Once that's done, tear the paper into 1 inch (2.5 cm) squares.",
        "You can also use butcher paper, which you can order online.",
        "Blow a balloon up.",
        "Make it the size you want your piggy bank to be.",
        "Tie the balloon off when it reaches your desired size.",
        "It doesn\u2019t matter what color the balloon is, as it\u2019s just providing a structure to papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 on top of and won\u2019t actually be visible.",
        "Papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 the balloon.",
        "Wet both sides of the pieces of paper with the flour paste you mixed earlier and apply them to the pig.",
        "Get just enough paste on the paper to have it stick, but not so much that it's dripping.",
        "Smooth the paper onto the pig as you apply it and cover the space evenly.",
        "The paper will dry in about 15 minutes.",
        "Add 3 layers of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 onto the pig.",
        "Once you add the layers, let the balloon sit for 2 days in a well-lit, well-ventilated area of your home so it can dry fully.Tip: Your piggy bank will be stronger if you allow each layer to dry before adding another.",
        "This is why you should wait about 15 minutes in between adding layers.",
        "Slice out a 1 inch (2.5 cm)-long coin slot.",
        "Have an adult use a box cutter to make a coin slot that\u2019s at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) long so you can fit standard US quarters in it.",
        "If you want to put bigger coins in the piggy bank, you\u2019ll have to make the slot about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) long.",
        "Since papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 can be delicate, measure out your cut with a pen before you commit to it.",
        "You can also use this hole to pull the balloon out from the inside of the piggy bank.",
        "Feel free to throw the balloon away when you\u2019re done with it.",
        "Attach legs and a nose.",
        "Cut out 5 sections from a paper egg carton using scissors.",
        "Have an adult use a low-heat hot glue gun to attach them to the appropriate places on the balloon.",
        "Line the edges of the egg-holders with hot glue and place 4 of them on the side of the papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 balloon opposite the coin slot.",
        "Put the nose in the middle of whichever side you\u2019ve picked to be the front of the piggy bank.",
        "Place the piggy bank on its legs so the glue can set and let it sit for 30 minutes before you begin decorating.",
        "Decorate your piggy bank with paint and accessories.",
        "Paint the body of the piggy bank with spray or acrylic paint, evenly coating the surface as you go.",
        "Then, make a tail by twisting a pink pipe cleaner into a spiral and having an adult help you hot glue it to the pig\u2019s bottom.",
        "You can also give the pig eyes by gluing googly eyes onto its face, or by drawing, cutting out, and gluing on eyes.",
        "Ultimately, the design is your choice.",
        "Other decoration ideas include drawing nostrils onto the pig\u2019s snout with a black marker and cutting 2 triangles out of pink paper or felt to glue them on as ears.",
        "If you do not want to use paint, you can color the body of the piggy bank with markers."
