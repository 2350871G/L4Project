Then, soak a clean, lint-free cloth in the bucket of soapy suds, and thoroughly wipe the headlights and the area immediately surrounding them until they\u2019re clean. You can find car soap at your local automotive supply store or online. Rinse soapy suds off your car with clean water. Spray the headlights and the area surrounding them with clean water from a garden hose. Or, if you don\u2019t have access to a hose, you can fill another bucket with clean water and then dump the water onto the area you cleaned. Dry the area you washed with a clean, lint-free towel. Drying the area you washed with a towel immediately after washing it, instead of letting it air dry, will help prevent water spots from appearing.

Applying polishing compound in this way will help make your headlights clear again. Repeat the polishing process if parts of your headlight aren\u2019t as clear and smooth as you\u2019d like.

You can find wax paste at your local automotive supply shop. Cover the area surrounding the headlights with paper or plastic. Before you spray UV sealant on your headlights, you\u2019ll want to protect the surrounding area. You can cut up paper grocery bags and tape them down on your car\u2019s surface with painter\u2019s tape. Cover an area around a 1 foot (0.30 m) from the edge of the headlight. Spray on a coat of UV sealant to prevent your headlights from hazing over. Position the nozzle of the spray container 4\u20135 inches (10\u201313 cm) from the surface of the headlight. Then, spray a light coat of UV sealant over every part of the headlight. Be sure to closely read and follow the instructions printed on the specific container of UV sealant you\u2019re using, as application processes may vary. Keep your headlights in direct sunlight for 10 minutes. Leaving the headlights in direct sunlight after you apply the UV sealant will give the sealant time to dry and bond with the surface of your headlights.
