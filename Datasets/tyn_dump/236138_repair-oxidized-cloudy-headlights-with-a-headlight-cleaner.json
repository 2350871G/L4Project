    "text": " Using a Glass Cleaning Solution Determine whether the damage to the lens is on the outside or on the inside (if inside you may notice moisture, and you may need to remove the lens, if possible and/or drain and dry it). Before trying any of these steps, try a \"Headlight Deoxidizer\" which will save time and is non-abrasive. Some of these steps may be unnecessary depending upon the damage or oxidation of your headlight lenses. Some headlights will require more work and some may be so bad that replacement is a better option. Try cleaning the lens with a glass cleaning solution like Windex if damage is on the outside of the lens. You can also use a watered-down degreaser to clean the headlight lenses. Follow this with a car polish or plastic polish available anywhere.  Follow directions on the polish bottle and do not apply in sunlight. Be sure not to get it on black, rubberized plastic parts as it will make a white film that is hard to remove. Use a rotary buffer to make this process faster and obtain better results. To make this repair last longer seal with car wax or silicone sealer. Using Masking Tape Get a lens repair kit. Easy-to-use kits like the lens repair kit from 3M are available at local automotive retailers. Tape, sandpaper, lens polish and directions are included, and there's an online video that shows you how to do it. Mask around the headlight. Protect your car's finish with masking or painting tape.

Using Toothpaste Try any toothpaste, including a gel type; wear rubber gloves. Almost any kind \u2014 especially whitening ones \u2014 have an abrasive such as silica, other fine grit or soda. Wash your headlight lenses to clean of grit and road film.  Avoid getting any of the cleaner or polish on paint, chrome, plastic or rubber.
