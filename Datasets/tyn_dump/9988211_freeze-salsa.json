When you put your salsa in the freezer, label it with the date so you know how long it\u2019s good for. Include if the salsa is mild or spicy if you have several varieties. Making Freezer Salsa Cut 10-15 tomatoes into 4 quarters and remove the seeds. Use a sharp knife to cut each tomato in half, and then cut each half in half. Lay one of the quarters so the rounded side is on the cutting board. Run your blade as close to the outer flesh of the tomato as possible to cut out the seeds and core of each tomato. Chop the tomatoes, onions, and green peppers into cubes. You'll need 2 large onions and 2 green peppers. The thickness each cube will depend on how chunky you want the salsa to be once it\u2019s finished. Chop 8 jalapeno peppers finely. Cut the jalapenos into smaller cubes that the rest of the ingredients. These peppers have a more intense flavor that could be overwhelming in large quantities.

Alternatively, store the salsa in an airtight container. You should still leave room at the top for the salsa to expand once it freezes. Label the container or bag with the date you made the salsa. Thawing and Using Frozen Salsa Thaw the salsa in your fridge for 24 hours before cooking with it. Don\u2019t leave your salsa at room temperature to thaw. Transfer the salsa from the freezer to fridge the day before you plan to use it. Drain the excess water from the thawed salsa. Water may have formed once the salsa has thawed. If so, carefully pour the excess water into the sink to make your salsa chunkier. Marinate steak with salsa. Pour the salsa into the same container as the steak. Let it sit at room temperature for 1 hour. As an alternative, marinate the steak for 24 hours in the fridge in a covered container so the flavor fully absorbs into the steak. Grill the meat over medium-high heat until it reaches your desired temperature. Steaks need to reach an internal temperature of 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C) for safe consumption.
