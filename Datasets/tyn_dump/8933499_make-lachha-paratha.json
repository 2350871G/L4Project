    "text": " Making the Dough Combine the wheat flour, ghee, and salt. Measure 2 cups (259 g) of whole wheat flour (gehun ka atta) into a mixing bowl. Add 2 tablespoons (28 g) of the ghee and salt according to your taste. Stir the mixture until it's well combined. Knead in the water.

The amount of water you'll need depends on your flour and the humidity in your kitchen. Rest the dough for 20 to 25 minutes. Spray a sheet of plastic wrap with cooking spray and place it over the bowl with the paratha dough. The greased side should be facing down towards the dough. Set the dough aside for 20 to 25 minutes to rest. Rolling the Lachha Parathas Divide the dough into 7 pieces. Remove the plastic wrap from the bowl and scoop the dough onto your work surface. Divide the dough into 7 even pieces. You can use a knife or bench scraper to cut the dough into equal-sized pieces or use a digital scale to portion out the pieces. Roll the dough pieces into circles. Sprinkle your work surface with extra whole wheat flour and set one of the dough pieces on it. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough into an 8-inch (20 cm) circle.

You may need to sprinkle more whole wheat flour to the surface or your rolling pin if the dough sticks. Cooking the Lachha Parathas Heat a skillet. Set a nonstick skillet or tava on your stove. Turn the heat on to medium. Allow the skillet to fully heat before you add your paratha. Brush the parathas with more ghee. Melt another 7 teaspoons (33 g) of ghee. Dip the pastry brush in the ghee and brush some over each paratha circle. Turn the parathas over and brush the other side with ghee. Cook the paratha until they're slightly brown. Place one paratha in the heated skillet or tava. Cook the paratha for about 5 to 10 seconds. Use tongs to carefully flip it over and cook it for 10 to 15 seconds on the other side. Keep turning and cooking the paratha until both sides are lightly golden brown. This should take less than a full minute for each paratha. Serve the lachha parathas while they're warm.
