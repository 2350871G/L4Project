You will need to punch a hole in the middle of the disc. Slide the disc onto pencil. This will give you a way to hold the disc and spin it rapidly. Hold the disc in place. Put tape around the pencil an inch above and below the disc. This will prevent the wheel from wobbling off of the pencil as it spins. This way, you can spin the disc faster without it flying off of the pencil. Spin the disc around the pencil. At first you will see the colors quickly spinning. As you spin the disc faster, you will start to see the colors blending, and they will blend together and appear white. If you aren\u2019t seeing this happen, try spinning the disc even faster. Adjust your technique. If you are still able to see most colors, try spinning the wheel faster. Be aware that you may not see a perfectly white wheel. You are trying to spin the wheel faster than your eyes can process the colors. Understanding the Science Look at a prism. A prism is used to split visible light. It separates the light by different frequencies, which appear different in color. Shining a white light through a prism will yield all of the colors of the rainbow (the visible light spectrum). If you do not have access to a prism, water can also split light. This can be observed in rainbows. Study the visible spectrum. Visible light is the small range of electromagnetic energy that the human eye can detect and translate into an image. When the entire spectrum is present, the light appears white in color. When particular frequencies are absorbed, reflected, or otherwise not present, the eye sees different colors, for example red or green. Consider color combinations. The frequencies that make up the visible spectrum are present on your color wheel. This is why spinning the wheel fast enough to blur those colors together makes them appear white. The light from all of the colors is hitting your eye at almost the exact same time. This tricks the eye into thinking you are seeing white light.",
