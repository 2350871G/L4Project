To ventilate the evaporating gas, the cooler should either have a lid that doesn't seal completely shut or a drainage cap (usually located near the bottom of the cooler). If you need a small cooler or just want to use the dry ice for a day, choose a styrofoam cooler or urethane-insulated box. For longer dry ice use or for a larger cooler, choose a roto-moulded or plastic cooler. If you're using the urethane-insulated box, buy one that's at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) thick."

To prevent damage to the cooler, leave the lid slightly cracked (if you're using styrofoam or the urethane box). If you're using a plastic or roto-moulded cooler, unscrew the drainage cap a little. If the gas has no way to escape, pressure can build up within the cooler and weaken the plastic."
