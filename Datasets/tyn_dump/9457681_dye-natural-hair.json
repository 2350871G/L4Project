If you want to go lighter, go to a trained stylist, and be prepared for multiple sessions. You can tell how many levels you're lifting your hair based on the developer volume you use, from 10 to 40. A 30 volume developer typically lifts 3 levels. Consider balayage. This way, you won't have to retouch your hair as often because your roots will already be their natural color."
