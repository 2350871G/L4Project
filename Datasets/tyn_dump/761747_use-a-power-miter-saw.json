This is determined by the blade diameter, and normally varies between 8 and 12 inches. The diameter of the saw's blade will determine how wide and thick the material you are cutting can be. Action. There are three types of power miter saw:\nStandard miter saw: The basic, standard miter saw will make a perpendicular cut through a board or other material at angles typically ranging from 45 degrees left (counterclockwise) to 45 degrees right (clockwise). An angle scale and locking device keep the blade correctly aligned. Compound miter saw: Adds the ability to tilt the blade at a specified angle from vertical, to cut a compound angle. Sliding miter saw: The saw slides along a horizontal arm, similar to a radial arm saw. It can be pushed through the material being cut, which allows a much wider piece of stock to be sawed."

            "description": "In electrical tools, the power to do the job the tool is designed for is generally considered the amperage rating of the tool, or its horsepower. A standard miter saw is designed to draw (use) between 12 and 15 amps or electrical power, and operate on 120 volts (in the U.S.). For cutting tough or very large pieces of stock you may need to select an industrial rated machine which is much heavier and may require special wiring."
