Carefully push down to flatten the bottom, without making holes in the ball with your fingers. Form a ball that is a bit smaller than a ping pong ball. Include a little extra in case (for the neck). Put the head on top of the body at an angle then smooth it in with your fingers and some water. Use the extra to make a neck. To get this part right, it is suggested that you keep a picture of a bird in front of you. Take a small rectangle of clay and put it opposite the head for the tail. Smooth it in, in the same manner as you did with the head. Add some detail. For the beak, just locate the right place and put on a little bit of clay and smooth it in, then use a toothpick to shape the beak. Easy. Take a clay oval and smooth it onto the body. Use a toothpick and your fingers to shape it. Do the same on the other side to make wings. Widen the tail at the end by lightly flattening and pushing into the clay. Make some ruffles by adding and smoothing in some clay strips the length of the tail. Add eyes if you want.  Check that there are no cracks, as these weaken it when it's dry. If there are any, smooth them out with water and your fingers. If you want your clay bird to be hollow, make a hole in the flat side that goes to a bit before the edge. Carefully spoon out the clay, being careful at the head. Don't hollow out the tail. Leave to dry. If wished, you can paint the bird or add clear varnish.
