Flip them so the proper side faces up before you pin them in place with adjustable clamps. The underside is flatter than the top edge, making it easier to cut across. The top side of each sheet has ridges that stick up and are tricky to cut across cleanly. Always turn sheets so the ridges are upside down, valleys instead of mountains."

Make an estimate by measuring the length and width of each section of your roof. You will also need to know the size of the roofing sheets available in order to fit them together. Divide the roof\u2019s area estimate by the average size of the sheets to figure out how many you need for the project. You could look up a metal roofing calculator online to help you figure out how many sheets you need. Then, fit the sheets together according to your roof measurements. For example, if you have a 21 ft \u00d7 10 ft (6.4 m \u00d7 3.0 m) roof, you have 210 sq ft (20 m) space to cover. Divide it by an 18 sq ft (1.7 m) sheet to get an estimate of 12 sheets."

For downsides, the cutting process is a little slow and difficult to complete accurately if you have a lot to do. Select yellow or plain tin snips to cut straight lines. This type is useful for most cuts you need to make when working with metal roofing. Choose left-handed snips with red handles for cutting counterclockwise, removing metal to your left.

All you have to do is hold the shears where you need to cut, press the trigger, and control the blade as it moves along the metal. Although quality shears slice more smoothly than a hot knife through steak, you still have to be careful with them. Sometimes they get stuck, forcing you to approach the cut from the opposite angle.

        "Squeeze the handles to cut the metal along the guideline.",
        "Press the jaws of the snips down as firmly as you can, then open up wide again.",
        "Repeat this until you reach the end of the metal.",
        "Get as much of the metal as you can with each stroke in order to make the cut as smooth and steady as possible.",
        "Tin snips leave jagged edges, so handle the metal carefully.",
        "Wear a strong pair of gloves to protect yourself.",
        "The snips work best when cutting shorter lengths, such as across the width of a single sheet.",
        "Use power shears if you need to make quicker straight cuts.",
        "Power shears are very similar to tin snips but come in both electric and pneumatic varieties.",
        "If you\u2019re cutting a length 2 ft (0.61 m) or more, shears are speedier and make for better quality cuts.",
        "Also, take advantage of power shears when you need to cut up several different sheets in a short amount of time.",
        "Shears cut similarly to scissors but are electric.",
        "All you have to do is hold the shears where you need to cut, press the trigger, and control the blade as it moves along the metal.",
        "Although quality shears slice more smoothly than a hot knife through steak, you still have to be careful with them.",
        "Sometimes they get stuck, forcing you to approach the cut from the opposite angle.",
        "As long as you don\u2019t rush or force the shears, you won\u2019t have much trouble.",
        "Using a Circular Saw or a Nibbler Cut with a circular saw for a quicker way to size multiple sheets.",
        "Saws are also useful for slicing through multiple pieces of roofing in one go, but a lot of safety concerns come along with them.",
        "They are very loud and can be destructive if you\u2019re not careful.",
        "Wear earplugs and secure the metal sheeting well so the saw can\u2019t slip out of position.",
        "Saw blades wear out over time, so replacing old blades gets a little costly if you cut a lot of metal.",
        "Saw blades get hot and can damage the roofing if you\u2019re not cautious.",
        "They also create more dust and metal fragments that pose a risk to anyone without the proper safety gear.",
        "If you\u2019re looking for an alternative to a circular saw, try an angle grinder.",
        "It\u2019s more like a handheld version of a circular saw and works about as well on roofing.",
        "It is more mobile, but it requires more hand control.",
        "Fit the saw with a metal-cutting blade.",
        "When you\u2019re cutting metal, go for something spiky and abrasive.",
        "Steel-tooth and carbide-tooth blades are both good choices.",
        "A 7 in (18 cm) blade is the perfect size for most circular saws and projects.",
        "Select a 4 in (10 cm) if you\u2019re using an angle grinder.",
        "Always check the blade\u2019s label to ensure it\u2019s right for your project.",
        "Look for blades meant to cut sheet metal or metal roofing.",
        "Carbide-tooth blades are costlier but last longer, so choose one if you plan on getting plenty of use out of your saw.",
        "Line the blade up with the cutting guideline you marked.",
        "Once you know where to slice the metal, set the saw on the edge of it.",
        "Make sure you approach at the right angle.",
        "You only get one chance to cut it cleanly, and if the sheet shifts at all, you might fall off of the guideline.",
        "Unlike with tin snips, you don\u2019t get a second chance to adjust, so keep a close eye on the blade.",
        "Move slowly, keeping your hands firmly placed on the saw\u2019s guard at all times.",
        "Cut along the guideline at a slow and steady pace.",
        "Saw blades cut through metal sheets at a fairly rapid rate.",
        "However, rushing is still risky.",
        "Hold the saw with a gentle amount of pressure, enough to control it and keep it positioned on the line.",
        "Push it forward along the metal to complete the cut.",
        "If the saw stops working, don\u2019t force it forward.",
        "Turn it off and take it to the other side of the guideline.",
        "Complete the cut from that angle to create a secure but whole panel for your roof.",
        "Get an electric drill nibbler to complete rounded cuts.",
        "Using a nibbler is similar to using a saw, but it is a much better way to complete specialty cuts.",
        "You can get a separate tool or an attachment that fits on an electric drill.",
        "Like the name suggests, it takes small rabbit bites out of the metal.",
        "Starting at the edge of the roofing sheet, push the nibbler forward along the guideline you drew to complete the cut.",
        "Nibblers are specialty tools, so they aren\u2019t great for straight cuts.",
        "Fortunately, you have your saw for that.",
        "Use a nibbler instead for tasks like cutting a hole for a vent pipe."
