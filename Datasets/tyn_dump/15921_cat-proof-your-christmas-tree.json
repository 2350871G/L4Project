While decorating, if your cat is about, resist the urge to tease her with decorations as you're adding them.

Ribbons and other items that dangle from the tree can also be potentially harmful for your cat. Artificial snow is toxic and should not be used when you have pets and small children. Tinsel is not recommended for households with cats; it can cause choking or other internal problems if swallowed, such as intestinal blockage. It is recommended that you don't use real candles on a tree when you have pets. Things can go wrong all too easily with a quick swipe of the paw and the resulting flames.

That way, there is nothing of interest at the cat's eye level. Some cats cannot help themselves and will climb up high whatever you do. If your cat is like this, then avoid having any delicate or potentially dangerous items on the tree at all. Tinsel, if used at all, should be placed up high as it is likely to be dragged off by a curious cat, and it can be very harmful if ingested, including getting caught in the stomach and intestines."

Apple cider vinegar can also be sprayed as a cat repellant. If it's a plastic tree, a small amount of Citronella oil shaken into a bottle of water and misted on to the tree makes it smell unpleasant to the cat, but fresh and citrus-like to you. Spray some pine cones with Citronella and pile them around the base of the tree. Cats do not walk on pine cones! Pine cones also have the same effect in the base of your houseplants. You could also place orange peels under the tree to make your cat less likely to go near it. Cats also dislike the smell of rotten apples, but then you probably won't like that smell much either! Try spraying your tree with a little orange juice. Cats hate the smell of citrus, so orange juice can act as a deterrent. Slices of orange can also be used for decoration."

Keep the tree in a clear space that makes jumping either difficult or unlikely. If possible, select a placement for the tree that allows you to shut the door at night or when nobody is about, in order to keep the cats away from the tree.

For a kitten, a tabletop tree might be a suitable choice until it grows up and becomes a bit calmer. If the tree is shorter than 6 feet (180cm), you might find it handy to use duct tape to tape the legs of the holder to a piece of wide plywood and put the whole tree on a short but very sturdy table. This keeps the tree above the level of the cat and the cat will likely be less interested.

A chewed artificial tree isn't going to be that healthy for your cat to ingest either, so balance the choice of tree type with how you intend to keep the tree safe from your cat. If you do choose a real tree, also choose a water container for the tree that is completely inaccessible to the cat. If your kitty tries to drink from it, there is a risk of poisoning."

        "There should be plenty of room around the tree so that it isn't too near items that are easily climbed by cats.",
        "If there are tempting shelves or furniture pieces to act as launch pads for your cat, it will be very likely to jump off them and land on the tree.",
        "Keep the tree in a clear space that makes jumping either difficult or unlikely.",
        "If possible, select a placement for the tree that allows you to shut the door at night or when nobody is about, in order to keep the cats away from the tree.",
        "Obviously, this isn't always possible; but if it is an option, make use of it.",
        "You could anchor your tree to the wall for a little extra security.",
        "Use a screw and thin wire, so you won't be able to see it.",
        "Consider the size of the tree.",
        "A small tree will be safer than a larger tree because there is less weight to crash down if your cat decides to climb it and things go horribly wrong.",
        "For a kitten, a tabletop tree might be a suitable choice until it grows up and becomes a bit calmer.",
        "If the tree is shorter than 6 feet (180cm), you might find it handy to use duct tape to tape the legs of the holder to a piece of wide plywood and put the whole tree on a short but very sturdy table.",
        "This keeps the tree above the level of the cat and the cat will likely be less interested.",
        "Of course, you still need to ensure that the tree is nowhere near any launching points for an opportunistic jump.",
        "Select a strong and unwavering base for holding the tree.",
        "Always use caution when selecting a tree base and get one that is guaranteed to stay firmly in place if the tree is knocked over.",
        "This is as important for the safety of children as it is for pets.",
        "Even an artificial tree should have a firm and solid base.",
        "Use a tree skirt to hide all ugly but practical safety fixes at the base of the tree, including electrical items.",
        "As well as a solid base, anchor the tree to the wall or ceiling to help prevent it from toppling over should your cat land in the tree or pull on it.",
        "Decide whether you want an artificial or real tree.",
        "Real Christmas trees are potentially more dangerous to your cat than artificial ones.",
        "This is because the needles on a real tree are sharp and can pierce or puncture the skin of an overly curious cat, while the pine needles themselves are irritating to mildly toxic if chewed (depending on the species of tree used).",
        "A chewed artificial tree isn't going to be that healthy for your cat to ingest either, so balance the choice of tree type with how you intend to keep the tree safe from your cat.",
        "If you do choose a real tree, also choose a water container for the tree that is completely inaccessible to the cat.",
        "If your kitty tries to drink from it, there is a risk of poisoning."
