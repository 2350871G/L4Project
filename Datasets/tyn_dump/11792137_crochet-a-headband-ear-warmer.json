A slip knot gets its name from the fact that if you keep pulling, the knot unravels and slips off. Chain stitches until the piece is as long as your adjusted measurement. Wrap the working yarn around your hook so it catches. Pull the yarn through the slip knot that's on your hook. Then, wrap the yarn around the hook again and pull it through the closest stitch.

For example, if your measurement should be 20 \u20442 inches (52 cm), make the foundation chain this long too. Working the Ear Warmer Body Join the ends and chain 1. Locate the first chain you made and insert your hook through the center of it. Wrap the yarn around your hook and pull the hook through the loop. Then, wrap the yarn around the hook again and pull it through to chain 1. Ensure that the chain isn't twisted before you join the ends or your headband won't lay flat. Double crochet (DC) into every chain stitch across the round. Wrap the yarn around the hook and insert it into the next chain on the round. Pull the yarn through to make a loop. Once you have 3 loops on your hook, wrap the yarn around the end and pull through all three loops. This makes a DC stitch. Repeat this for each of the chain stitches of your round. Join the round when you reach the end of the round. When you reach the first DC stitch that you made, insert the hook into it and wrap your yarn around the hook. Pull it through the first loop. Then, grab the loop and pull it through the remaining loop on your hook. You're making a slip stitch to join the rounds. Chain 1 and DC into every stitch of the second round. Wrap the yarn around your hook and pull it through to create 1 chain stitch. Then, work the double crochet stitch into each chain along the round. At this point, the headband is about 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide. Repeat the pattern until the headband ear warmer is as wide as you like. When you reach the end of the round, slip stitch to join it. Then, chain 1 and DC across the row. Keep working this pattern as long as you like. For a headband ear warmer that's 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) wide, make about 6 or 7 rounds. Chain 1 and tie it off to finish the headband ear warmer. Join your last round and make 1 chain. Then, cut the yarn and leave a 6 inches (15 cm) tail.Thread the tail through the chain and pull to make a knot. Remember to weave in both of your yarn tails before you wear the headband ear warmer.Tip: To weave the ends in, thread a yarn tail onto a tapestry needle and sew the yarn through the stitches of the closest row. Trying Variations Gather the center of the warmer to give it a twisted look. Instead of twisting the ends of the fabric, crochet your simple headband ear warmer and leave a long yarn tail when you reach the end. Cut the thread and slide it through a tapestry needle.
