Lay out plastic sheeting on ground or surface area. Tape down the edges with masking tape to keep it in place. Sand the wood with 80-grit sandpaper. Use small, circular motions to gradually buff away any visible flaws or marks. Be sure to cover the entire surface of the wood evenly. To make the process easier and faster, purchase a sanding block from your local hardware store. To sand the difficult-to-reach corners of a wooden object, attach sand paper to the end of a flexible putty knife. Remove sanding dust from the wood before applying the oil finish. For a quick and easy clean-up, use a hand-held vacuum to suck up dust. You can also use a brush or can of compressed air to push dust away from the surface of the wood. Applying Danish Oil with the Wet-on-Wet Method Put on an initial coat of Danish oil. After sanding the wood, apply Danish oil to a clean, lint-free cloth. Generously apply the oil to the wood in broad strokes, reapplying oil to the cloth as needed. Continue this until the wood stops absorbing the oil. When the wood stops absorbing the oil, it will lose its shine and look dull. Let the wood rest for twenty minutes. After this break the wood will be able to absorb more oil. Set an alarm or reminder to keep track of the time. Apply a second coat of oil. After twenty minutes, apply more oil to the surface of the wood. Apply a thinner coat this time, as less oil will be absorbed into the wood than the first time. Stop applying the oil when the wood stops absorbing it. Let the wood sit, then wipe it down. Let the wood rest for another twenty minutes. Using a clean, lint-free cloth, wipe away excess oil from the surface of the wood. Let it sit for an hour, then wipe the surface again with a clean cloth. Air dry the wood. Let your wood dry in a warm room for a full 48 hours before touching it. Moving it too soon is likely to cause marks or disrupt the drying process of the oil. Keep the object out of direct sunlight, which can affect the finish. Creating a Very Smooth Finish with Danish Oil Apply oil to the wood and keep it wet. After sanding, apply Danish oil to your sanded wood surface with a brush or clean cloth. Re-wet any part of the wood surface that become dull because the oil is being absorbed. Keep the surface wet for three to four minutes, reapplying the oil as needed. Wipe off excess oil and let the wood dry. Make sure that no oil is pooled or clustered in corners of the wood. Allow it to dry overnight in a warm room. Apply a second coat of oil and sand it. The next day, apply a second coat of oil to the wood with a clean cloth or brush. While the oil is still wet, use very fine sandpaper to sand the surface. Use long, light strokes and move in the direction of the grain. For best results, use 600-grit wet/dry sandpaper, available at hardware stores. Remove excess oil and dry the wood. Be sure that all sanding debris is also removed from the wood surface. Once again, leave the wood to dry overnight in a warm room. Repeat the process a third time.
