Then, put a baking sheet on the rack and let it preheat along with the oven. The lowest rack position is closest to the heating element inside the toaster oven. You may want to confirm the location of the heating element, though, since some toaster ovens may vary. Preheating the baking sheet creates a \"mini griddle\" that will result crisp, golden brown bread."
