To make a shamrock, you will need:\nMedium worsted weight yarn in green\nA size H crochet hook. Scissors Make a slipknot and then chain four. Start by making a slipknot for your first loop on the hook. You can make a slipknot by looping yarn around your index and middle finger twice and then pulling one loop through the other. Slide this loop onto your hook and then make a chain of four. To make a chain, simply loop the yarn over the hook and pull it through the second loop on the hook. Keep doing this until you have a chain of four. Join with a slipstitch. Next, you will need to connect the chain of four into a circle with a slipstitch. To slipstitch, insert the hook into the first link in the chain, loop the yarn over the hook, and pull it through both loops. Now you should have a chain circle. You will be working into the center of the circle to create your shamrock petals. Making Shamrock Petals Chain four. Start your first shamrock petal by making a chain of four extending from the chain circle. This chain will be the outer edge of your first shamrock petal. Do a triple crochet into center. Next, triple crochet into the center of the circle. This will be your longest stitch and it will form the outer edges of your petal.To triple crochet:\nLoop the yarn around the hook twice. Then, insert the hook into the center of the circle and loop the yarn over again. Pull the yarn through the center of the circle, and the yarn over again. Pull the yarn through the first two stitches on the hook. Then, yarn over again and pull through the next two stitches on the hook. Finally, yarn over again and pull through the remaining stitches on the hook to complete a triple crochet stitch. Double crochet into center. The next stitch in the petal will be a double crochet stitch into the center of the circle. This stitch will be a little shorter than the triple crochet stitch, so it will create a slight indent in the petal, which is common for shamrocks. To double crochet:\nStart by looping the yarn around the hook once. Then, insert the yarn into the center of the circle and yarn over again. Pull the yarn through the center of the circle and yarn over again. Then, pull through the first two loops on the hook. Yarn over again, and pull through the last two loops. This will complete your double crochet stitch. Triple crochet into center again. For your next stitch, do another triple crochet stitch into the center of the circle. This stitch will create the second raised area of your petal. Chain four and slipstitch into center. To finish your first shamrock petal, make another chain of four and then slipstitch into the center of the circle to connect it. This will complete your first petal. Make two more petals just like this one to complete your shamrock petals. Creating a Stem Chain seven. To start the stem, make a chain of seven extending from the center of your shamrock. This will be the base of your shamrock stem. If desired, you can make the stem a little longer or shorter. Do a half double crochet into third chain from hook. To give the stem a thicker base, start by doing a half double crochet stitch into the third chain from the hook. To do a half double crochet stitch:\nLoop the yarn over the hook and insert it into the third chain from the hook. Then, pull the yarn through this first loop and yarn over again. Then, pull through all three loops on the hook to complete the stitch. Slipstitch along the chain and back to the center. After the half double crochet stitch, all you need to do is slipstitch along the chain and up to the center of the shamrock. When you reach the center, you can cut your yarn a few inches away from the hook, pull it through to secure it, and then tie your starting and ending yarn pieces together to secure them.
