For trapezoidal roofs, measure the bottom edge, the top edge (also known as the \u201cridge\u201d), and the distance between the 2 edges. If you\u2019re working with a rectangular roof, be sure to measure both the longer and shorter hips separately. You\u2019ll need both sets of dimensions in order to accurately tab out your roof\u2019s total square footage. Jot down eat dimension separately in a notebook or scrap sheet of paper. Don\u2019t forget to label which dimension is which. It\u2019s not necessary to measure the vertical sides of your roof, or to figure out its slope. To find the square footage of a hip roof, you just need to calculate the area of each of its faces. For this, you'll use the same formula that you would use to find the area of an ordinary triangle or trapezoid."

        "With your primary framing members in place, all that\u2019s left to do is fill in the space between the common, king common, and hip rafters with additional vertical supports.",
        "Space your rafters according to the guidelines laid out in your local building codes.",
        "The rafters spanning the length of the ridge board will all be a uniform length, but be sure to cut each rafter shorter and shorter as they begin to progress down the hip.",
        "Measure from the top of the last rafter you set to the top of the next one in the row to figure out how much to wood to take off of each board.",
        "For overhanging roofs, you\u2019ll also need to cut birdsmouth notches into the rafters at the point where they\u2019ll meet the exterior wall of the structure."
