Handgun/Samurai Edge: After two well placed shots to its upper chest, you might get lucky and blow off its head on the third shot. Also, when you and the zombie are at slightly different elevations and you aim up or down to its level, you have a higher chance of scoring a headshot. Samurai Edge gets more headshots than the Handgun. Under normal circumstances with the Handgun, about 1 in 10 shots will blow off their head. Magnum: You almost automatically get a headshot with this, but you should try to save Magnum ammo for the end of the game."
