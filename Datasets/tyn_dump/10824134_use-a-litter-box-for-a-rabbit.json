However, if you have a pair of rabbits or a rabbit that weighs over 10 lb (4.5 kg), then get a giant-sized litterbox. You can go with a pan that is the same height all the way around, or choose a box that has 1 low side to make it easier for your rabbit to get into the box.Standard height litter pans and high back litter pans are good choices for most rabbits. If the litterbox is too high for your bunny to get into, use a sharp pair of scissors to cut out a 12 by 4 in (30 by 10 cm) section on 1 side of the litterbox.
