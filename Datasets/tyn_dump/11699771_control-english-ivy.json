Start by using your garden shears or clippers and cut all the English ivy vines around the base of the tree, as close to the ground you can get. Depending on the size of the vines, you may need to use loppers or even a small saw instead of garden shears/clippers. This method is called \u2018lifesaver\u2019 in reference to lifesaver candy, where the ground cleared around the tree is saving the life of the tree and the tree itself represents the hole in the candy."

        "Throw the vines you remove into a single pile to dispose of later.",
        "Cut a circle 3\u20136 feet (0.91\u20131.83 m) out from the base of the tree.",
        "Step away from the tree by 3\u20136 feet (0.91\u20131.83 m).",
        "Use your garden shears/clippers to cut a circle through the English ivy growing on the ground around the entire tree.",
        "You may need to adjust the distance from the tree depending on any obstacles that are in your way (e.g., fences, walkways, other plants, etc.).",
        "Make sure you cut through the entire thickness of the ivy that\u2019s lying on the ground.",
        "Make several radiating cuts out from the base of the tree.",
        "To make removal a little easier, cut more than 1 line through the English ivy from the base of the tree to the larger circle cut on the ground.",
        "These radiating cuts will divide the ivy on the ground into several smaller sections which can be removed individually.",
        "Cut as many or as few of these radiating line cuts as needed.",
        "Remove all ivy vines and roots from each section on the ground.",
        "Use your hands to pull away all the English ivy vines laying on the ground within each section.",
        "Make sure you pull all the roots out of the soil as you go.",
        "Cut through additional vines as needed.",
        "Be careful when pulling up the vines if there are any plants you want to keep growing through the ivy.",
        "Continue to put the removed ivy vines into a pile for disposal.",
        "Dispose of removed ivy in the trash or by burning it.",
        "Do not put the English ivy vines that you\u2019ve removed into your home compost.",
        "English ivy is very hardy and can regrow from only a small portion of root or stem.",
        "Put the removed ivy into the trash or curbside yard waste pick-up.",
        "Alternatively, you can burn the removed ivy vines if you prefer and if you have the appropriate space for such burning.",
        "Check the cleared area regularly and remove sprouting ivy.",
        "At least once a week for the following 3-6 months, check the ground around the tree.",
        "Look for any English ivy that\u2019s trying to regrow in that area and remove it immediately.",
        "If needed, cut back the vines that try to grow into the circle.",
        "Throw any ivy removed into the garbage.",
        "Do not attempt to pull down the dead ivy vines that are still in the tree or you might damage the tree.",
        "After several months, the vines left in the tree will die and the leaves will turn brown and fall off.",
        "Eventually, the ivy won\u2019t be as visible from below as the tree continues to grow.",
        "Rolling Ivy Vines into Logs Select a square area where you want to remove the ivy.",
        "The \u2018log\u2019 method is designed for English ivy that\u2019s covering a large area of ground.",
        "Start the removal process by mentally dividing that area into smaller 5\u20137 feet (1.5\u20132.1 m) square sections.",
        "Start with one small square and work your way systematically through the rest of the squares.",
        "It is not necessary to be precise about the size of the squares.",
        "The \u2018log\u2019 method can be done successfully by 1 person but is easier to do with at least 2 people.",
        "Use garden shears/clippers to cut a square perimeter in the ivy.",
        "Starting with the first square, use your garden shears/clippers to cut a perimeter around the square you want to remove.",
        "Make sure you cut through the full thickness of the ivy, right to the soil.",
        "You may need to use loppers or a saw in order to cut through some of the thicker ivy vines.",
        "Lift the ivy vines off the ground from one side.",
        "Pick one side of the square from which to start.",
        "If the area is sloped, start with the side of the square that\u2019s at the top of the slope so you can roll the ivy downhill.",
        "Use your gloved hands to pick up the English ivy along that side of the square and pull it away from the ground.",
        "Make sure you remove all the roots from the soil.",
        "Imagine the ivy lying on the ground within your square as a carpet.",
        "Starting with one side of the \u2018carpet,\u2019 you\u2019re going to roll it into a log-type shape.",
        "Pull ivy roots from the ground while rolling vines into a log.",
        "Continue to pull the English ivy off the ground and fold it over onto itself so you can roll it into a log-type shape.",
        "Go slowly so you can make sure all the roots have been removed from the soil.",
        "Use your garden shears/clippers if needed to loosen or untangle the vines.",
        "Try your best not to leave any roots behind.",
        "English ivy can regrow from very small pieces of roots or stems.",
        "Cut the ivy from around native plants to prevent damage to them.",
        "Hopefully, the area from which you\u2019re removing the English ivy is void of any other plants.",
        "However, if there are native plants growing through the ivy, be very careful not to disturb or remove them.",
        "Use your garden shears/clippers to cut the ivy around the native plant so you can pull away the ivy without pulling out the native plant.",
        "Check your provincial or state government websites to determine which plants are native to your area.",
        "There may be rules or regulations in your area that make it illegal to remove certain native plants.",
        "Keep rolling the vines until the complete square is removed.",
        "Either alone or with a partner, continue to pull the English ivy off the ground and to roll it into a log-type shape.",
        "If you\u2019re working on a slope, allow gravity to help you roll the ivy downhill.",
        "Keep rolling until you\u2019ve pulled all the ivy from the square you cut earlier.",
        "Note that the roots of English ivy are fairly shallow, growing only 1\u20134 in (2.5\u201310.2 cm) into the soil.",
        "Try to disturb the soil as little as possible.",
        "This includes walking on it after you\u2019ve removed the ivy.",
        "Dispose of the ivy log in the garbage or by mulching it.",
        "Do not put the removed English ivy into your home compost.",
        "Either put it in the trash or have it picked up as yard waste.",
        "If you\u2019ve cleared a massive area and regular disposal methods are not possible, you can mulch the ivy logs and spread the cut pieces onto the soil.",
        "Home compost systems do not get hot enough to completely kill the organic material inside.",
        "Therefore, when you use compost from your home system, you may accidentally transfer ivy plants into your garden.",
        "Mulch the ivy logs by cutting through them with loppers until only tiny pieces remain or by putting them through a wood chipper or running over it with a lawnmower.",
        "There is a small chance that mulched ivy will regrow.",
        "However, this may be the easiest method of disposing of ivy logs when controlling a really large area of land.",
        "Controlling Ivy with Chemicals Avoid spraying areas where native plants are growing with the ivy.",
        "Herbicides are not selective.",
        "When you spray herbicides onto an area, they will kill any and all plants in that area, including native plants.",
        "If there are native plants in the same location as the English ivy you want to control, you should use a non-chemical control method instead.",
        "Check your provincial or state government website to identify which plants are native to your area.",
        "Be aware that some provinces or states consider it illegal to remove or disturb native plants.",
        "Apply 2-5% solution of glyphosate or triclopyr to the leaves of the ivy.",
        "Purchase either glyphosate or triclopyr from a local garden centre or hardware store.",
        "Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions to mix a 2-5% solution of either chemical.",
        "Ensure the outside temperature is at least 12 \u00b0C (54 \u00b0F) and clear on both the day you spray and the following day.",
        "Use a handheld sprayer to apply that solution onto the English ivy.",
        "Spray enough so that the ivy leaves are wet, but not dripping with chemicals.",
        "Before using any herbicides, check with your local government to determine if either glyphosate or triclopyr are illegal where you live.",
        "English ivy leaves have a waxy texture to them, which can make it difficult for the herbicides to soak into and kill the plant.",
        "It is best to spray herbicides in the late fall or early winter.",
        "Spray 25% glyphosate or 2% 2,4-D to newly cut ivy vines and stems.",
        "Buy glyphosate or 2,4-D herbicides from a garden centre or hardware store.",
        "Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions to mix either a 25% solution of glyphosate or a 2% solution of 2,4-D. Use your garden shears/clippers to remove as many English ivy leaves as possible and cut through the vines of the ivy.",
        "Use a handheld sprayer to apply the herbicides onto the cut ivy, making sure to concentrate your spray on the raw ends of the stems and vines.",
        "Before using any herbicides, check with your local government to determine if either glyphosate or 2,4-D are illegal where you live.",
        "Make sure it\u2019s at least 12 \u00b0C (54 \u00b0F) and clear on the day you spray the herbicide and the following day.",
        "Monitor the sprayed area once a month and remove new growth.",
        "English ivy is very durable, hence why it\u2019s considered invasive.",
        "Using herbicides is still not a guarantee that the ivy will be completely controlled.",
        "Throughout the year following herbicide application, monitor the ivy that\u2019s been sprayed.",
        "If any specific areas are not dying off, spray additional herbicides onto those areas.",
        "You do not need to remove the dead ivy if you don\u2019t want to.",
        "You will not likely be able to grow anything successfully in the area where herbicides were sprayed.",
        "You may need to repeat this entire process if you\u2019re not able to completely control the ivy after 1 application."
