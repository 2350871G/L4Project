Even if you've got a great 6-pack, don't go shirtless in any of your photos. Another bad idea, don't have an open shirt, plus unbuttoned pants to demo your \"attitude\", six-pack or designer underpants. Even if you look great in that photo with your ex, don't post a cutout of yourself with a phantom manicured hand on your shoulder. It is very worthwhile to have a good photographer friend or a professional take some nice shots of you."
