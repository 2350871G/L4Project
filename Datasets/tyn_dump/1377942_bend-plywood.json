You want enough layers that the height of the form is about the same as the width of the plywood you\u2019re trying to bend. Glue the layers of MDF together to complete the form.

Making the plywood thicker will help it bend more easily. Using a Ratchet Strap Get a ratchet strap with S-hooks. A ratchet strap, also known as a tie-down strap, is a nylon strap with a hook on each end. There\u2019s a ratchet in the middle of the strap you can use to tighten the strap. Make sure the strap you get has S-hooks so it\u2019s able to hook onto the plywood. You can find a ratchet strap online or at your local hardware store. Read the label to see if the ratchet strap has S-hooks. Hook the S-hooks to opposite ends of the plywood. Center the hooks on the end they\u2019re hooked onto. Do this with the piece of plywood lying flat so the S-hooks don\u2019t slide off. Once the hooks are on, the ratchet strap should run down the center of the plywood, with the ratchet somewhere between the 2 hooks. You may need to thread the strap attached to one of the hooks through the ratchet so both sides of the strap are connected. Use the ratchet to tighten the strap until the plywood is bent how you want it. To tighten the strap with the ratchet, bring the handle of the ratchet up and down repeatedly. Each time you lift up the ratchet, it will pull in some of the slack. Continue lifting and lowering the handle on the ratchet until the plywood is bent to your desired curve. Leave the ratchet strap on the plywood overnight. After you\u2019ve let the plywood sit overnight, remove the ratchet strap. To remove the strap, lift the handle on the ratchet and pull it all the way back so it\u2019s flat on the strap. You should hear a clicking noise and the ratchet should stay open.
