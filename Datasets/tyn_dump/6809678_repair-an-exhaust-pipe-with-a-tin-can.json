Preparing Materials and Exhaust Pipe Obtain a tin can. The best tin can to use is a soup can about 4 inches in diameter for the standard 2 - 2.5 inch exhaust pipe. A larger can will be required for larger diameter pipes. Use tin snips or heavy duty scissors to cut the can up the side and to cut the bottom out of the can. (Note: don't attempt to cut the can with ordinary household scissors. It might work, but the scissors will be destroyed.) The bottom of the can may be removed with an ordinary can opener so that the bead is retained for strength purposes. Be very careful cutting the can, the edges are extremely sharp. Wear thick gloves such as leather gloves or even a good grade of mechanics gloves (not nitrile 'rubber' gloves). Set the cut can off to the side where it won\u2019t be in the way.  Use a steel wire brush to brush off any debris on the tail pipe that will hinder the seal of the can against the exhaust pipe. Note that the can should also be clean inside, but the picture is referring to the exhaust pipe, not to the can - remember, we set it aside a moment ago. Safety glasses are recommended for all steps, but are essential for this step because you are below the exhaust pipe you are cleaning. Floating debris seldom falls straight down, it swirls in any air current that is present - inevitably into your eyes. If there is any concern that the pipe is not going to allow sealing between the can and the pipe due to flaky material or uneven surfaces, a good sealant for exhaust joints should be used - something that will withstand 2000 degrees F or so. Now is the time to decide, not after you are unable to get the seal to occur. Wrapping the Can Around the Exhaust Pipe Form the can to the shape of the exhaust pipe centered over the hole, and where the two edges will overlap, providing a double-thickness of material over the hole. If the hole is too large, this won't suffice as a fix. Also if the material is found to be weakened more than just along the bottom or about one third of the diameter of the pipe, the pipe will be too weak to withstand the clamping step. Unscrew completely 5 #28 hose clamps so that they can be placed around the can.  Place all 5 of the clamps equally spaced across the length of the can.  Begin to screw the clamp on one of the ends until the clamp can no longer move. Make sure that the edge of the can is sliding under the other edge on both ends of the can as the clamps are tightened. Begin to screw the next clamp until the clamp can no longer move. Continue this until all clamps can not move. Return to the first clamp and tighten until the clamp cannot be tightened anymore. Continue this step for the remainder of the clamps. When clamps are completely tightened, the screw may skip and loosen depending on the diameter of the exhaust pipe. If this occurs tighten clamp again to a point it will not skip and loosen again.
