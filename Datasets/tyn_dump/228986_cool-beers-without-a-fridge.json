Completely submerge the surface of your beer container in cold water; the colder, the better. If the water is icy, you should be able to sufficiently cool a beer from room temperature to \"party cold\" within five minutes. The process might take somewhat longer if you're outdoors, or if the water is warmer. If you're indoors: Dunk the beers in a bucket of ice water, or run them under a cold tap for a few minutes. If you're outdoors: Submerge the beers in a natural water source \u2013 a river, a spring, a lake, or an ocean. Make sure to secure the beers so that they don't sink or drift away."

After you're done, try re-purposing the water: water your lawn, or your garden, or fill a pet's water bowl. Place your drinks in the ice water solution and rapidly stir them all around for 2-5 minutes. By stirring, you're using forced convection to speed the transfer of heat out of your drink and into the ice water solution. Add as much ice to the water as you can, but not so much that it prevents the entire beverage container from being submerged into the water. A 50/50 mix of ice and water is a good rule of thumb. The thicker and better-insulated the container, the better. Seal the container off from the air to retain even more of the chill. This way, the ice will melt more slowly."
