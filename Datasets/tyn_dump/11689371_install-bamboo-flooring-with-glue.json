It\u2019s okay if you slide a board 0.25\u20131 in (0.64\u20132.54 cm) when you\u2019re installing it against a wall, though. Don\u2019t step on your glue while doing this. Kneel in front of the glue-filled section and reach over it to access the wall. It\u2019s easiest to start against the longest wall in the room and build off of that. You can run the floorboards parallel or perpendicular to your longest wall. It\u2019s completely up to you whether you want to create columns or rows. If you aren\u2019t sure which option is best, run the boards parallel to the wall. This is the most common option. If you can do this in a corner, do that.

Continue adding floorboards until you get within 4\u20136 inches (10\u201315 cm) of the end of the glue. Use a rubber mallet to force 2 boards flush together if you can\u2019t get a perfect fit. Gently tap the side of a board to force it into place. You can only lay a new board down if you have enough glue remaining in a section to completely cover the bottom of the board. Some bamboo flooring kits have slots on one side of the board and corresponding shapes on the other side. These bamboo boards snap into one another.

In other words, lay some boards down that they stick out past the board next to it and lay some boards down so that they don\u2019t stick out past the previous board. If the bamboo flooring won\u2019t lay flat, gently tap the surface of the board or the edges with a rubber mallet to knock it into place. If the ends of your boards line up perfectly, you\u2019re going to end up with a strange, symmetrical pattern on the floor. Most wood floors are laid specifically so that the ends of the boards never line up. One way to ensure that the boards don\u2019t line up is to lay the middle of every board up against the end of the previous board you laid. This way, the end of each board will always bisect the board lying next to it."

When you encounter these, use a measuring tape to determine how long the piece for this slot must be. Go back to your saw and cut a board to size so that it fits the slot you just measured. After cutting the board to size, return to the installation area and fit the board into the slot. This process is a lot smoother if you have someone to help you. One person can cut the pieces to size while the other person installs boards elsewhere on the floor. Do your best to lay corners down before you enclose the entire area in surrounding boards. This way, you\u2019ll always have an angle to slide the board into the corner. For door jambs, slide boards underneath the edges instead of cutting them to size to make things easier."

Quarter-round refers to trim that is literally 1/4 of a round piece of wood. It is the most common trim for floorboards. You will need to miter your corners for corners of the room where 2 pieces of trim meet. To do this, cut your corners at a 45-degree angle and fit them together. If your floor isn\u2019t perfectly level, you\u2019ll end up with gaps between the bamboo and the quarter-round.

Kneel in front of the glue-filled section and reach over it to access the wall. It\u2019s easiest to start against the longest wall in the room and build off of that. You can run the floorboards parallel or perpendicular to your longest wall. It\u2019s completely up to you whether you want to create columns or rows. If you aren\u2019t sure which option is best, run the boards parallel to the wall. This is the most common option. If you can do this in a corner, do that. If your corner isn\u2019t a perfect 90-degrees though, leave a 1 ft (0.30 m) space and fill the area in later with a board you cut to size. Finish a row in your glued section before adding more rows. To keep things easy, fill out an entire row of your glued section with boards before adding adjacent pieces. This way, you can add as many pre-cut pieces as possible before running into the need to cut out additional pieces for the corners or doorways. When you add a new section of glue, always add it away from the door so that you don\u2019t need to walk over boards as they dry. Install a new row of boards next to your first row. Grab another board and lower it into place against the board you just installed. Lower it as close as you can to the edge where your first floorboard ends. Then, gently move it against the edge of the board so that the 2 pieces are flush with one another. Continue adding floorboards until you get within 4\u20136 inches (10\u201315 cm) of the end of the glue. Use a rubber mallet to force 2 boards flush together if you can\u2019t get a perfect fit. Gently tap the side of a board to force it into place. You can only lay a new board down if you have enough glue remaining in a section to completely cover the bottom of the board. Some bamboo flooring kits have slots on one side of the board and corresponding shapes on the other side. These bamboo boards snap into one another. Always match the slot to a cutout edge and vice versa when working with these floorboards. This will ensure a perfect fit. Add new layers of adhesive by pouring more out as you work. Once you\u2019re close to the edge of the glue, stop adding boards and apply a fresh 0.5\u20131 US gal (1.9\u20133.8 L) of glue. Create another rectangular section by spreading the adhesive around with your trowel the same way you did before. Move the trowel around at a 45-degree angle in a serpentine pattern until the adhesive is level. Repeat this process whenever you run out of adhesive. Keep a polyurethane wipe in your back pocket as you work so that you can wipe up any glue that accidentally gets on top of the floorboards you\u2019ve already installed. Continue adding floorboards by pressing them against one another. Once you have a new section of glue, continue to add new floorboards. Avoid laying them in a way where the ends of boards line up perfectly. In other words, lay some boards down that they stick out past the board next to it and lay some boards down so that they don\u2019t stick out past the previous board. If the bamboo flooring won\u2019t lay flat, gently tap the surface of the board or the edges with a rubber mallet to knock it into place. If the ends of your boards line up perfectly, you\u2019re going to end up with a strange, symmetrical pattern on the floor. Most wood floors are laid specifically so that the ends of the boards never line up. One way to ensure that the boards don\u2019t line up is to lay the middle of every board up against the end of the previous board you laid. This way, the end of each board will always bisect the board lying next to it. Cut unique pieces out as you work to fill in gaps. As you complete lengths of the floor, you will end up with small gaps near your walls, corners, and doorways where your precut pieces won\u2019t fit. When you encounter these, use a measuring tape to determine how long the piece for this slot must be. Go back to your saw and cut a board to size so that it fits the slot you just measured. After cutting the board to size, return to the installation area and fit the board into the slot. This process is a lot smoother if you have someone to help you. One person can cut the pieces to size while the other person installs boards elsewhere on the floor. Do your best to lay corners down before you enclose the entire area in surrounding boards. This way, you\u2019ll always have an angle to slide the board into the corner. For door jambs, slide boards underneath the edges instead of cutting them to size to make things easier. Continue laying boards and cutting pieces to size until your floor is covered. Continue this process by laying boards and pressing them down against one another. Cut uniquely-shaped or oddly-sized pieces to size as you encounter the gaps. Keep doing this until your floor is completely covered. You can use a miter saw, table saw, or reciprocating saw to cut pieces out of boards for vents, baseboard, or corners. Do these pieces towards the end of the installation process whenever possible. Finishing Your New Floor Fix any raised boards and allow your floor to dry for at least 24 hours. Once your flooring is laid down, walk carefully around the floor to press the boards down. Look for raised edges on your bamboo flooring. If you find any, gently tap them with a large rubber mallet to push the glue down and straighten the board. Then, wait at least 24 hours to give your floor some time to dry out.Tip: If all of your boards seem warped or are there are a ton of gaps in between boards, you likely installed the floor before the bamboo had acclimated to the space. You\u2019ll need to repeat this process again and double the acclimation time if this happens. This is why the acclimation is so important! You can use a commercial roller instead if you want to ensure a completely flat finish. Clean your floorboards to remove any fingerprints and dust. Your bamboo flooring is likely covered in footprints and fingerprints at this point. There may also be excess dust or polyurethane residue laying on top. Use a broom, vacuum, and clean cloth to remove any marks and clean up your floor. Do not get your bamboo floorboards wet at this point. The adhesive needs a little more time to cure completely and water can interfere with this process. Remove your spacers and install quarter-round or trim around the walls. With your floorboards in place, measure the distance between each wall to determine how long your trim should be. Mark each cut with a carpentry pencil and use quarter-round cutters or a miter saw to cut your trim to size. Use a nailgun to install the quarter-round over the expansion gap, and place 1 nail every 6\u201312 inches (15\u201330 cm). Quarter-round refers to trim that is literally 1/4 of a round piece of wood. It is the most common trim for floorboards. You will need to miter your corners for corners of the room where 2 pieces of trim meet. To do this, cut your corners at a 45-degree angle and fit them together. If your floor isn\u2019t perfectly level, you\u2019ll end up with gaps between the bamboo and the quarter-round. To seal this area, apply a thin bead of silicone caulk to the gap and wipe the excess away.",
