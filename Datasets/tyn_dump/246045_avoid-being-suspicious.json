Some smaller objectives during the conversation would be, maybe, 'gain their trust,' first. Then that brings us to tactics. Tactics will basically be \"How will I get the smaller goals accomplished?\" If you want your parents' trust, you'd maybe give them examples of how responsible you were in the past.
