After allowing the baggies to thaw, if the bags of ice still won't come out of your shoes, you can try waiting longer for most of the ice to melt, or try to break the ice and then remove the bags. These two alternatives are better than pulling on the baggies, ripping them, and then having open bags of water and ice in your shoes. The water could potentially damage your shoes."
