It should be between one-eighth and three-sixteenth inches (0.3cm to 0.5cm) wide all the way across. Measure all of the openings. If any of them are more than one-quarter inch (0.6cm) out of plumb, or not exactly vertical, you will need to adjust the trim. Remove the door to that you can eliminate possible causes of gaps.  Purchase a plumb bob to ensure you can test how level the jambs are before you install the door.  Fixing Possible Causes Place a four-foot (1.2m) level across the doorway. The door may be uneven because the floor is uneven. This is a common problem with doors and requires some adjustment in the door installation process. You can adjust the floor level by placing shims below the jambs and across the entryway to square it up. You may need to tear up flooring in order to place the shims underneath. Check with a level again once you install the shims to be sure it is no longer the cause of the problem. Ensure there isn\u2019t carpet in the way. If the bottom of the door is catching at the carpet, you may need to remove it or hang a slightly smaller door. Remove trim underneath the door or raise the doorjamb by setting it atop scraps of three-eighths to one-half inch trim can put the door at the correct height. Check the trim to see if it is square. Use a framing square to see if the trim may be the problem. Measure the width of the top, bottom and middle of the door to see if the door opening is completely parallel.

Hang your door. Ask a friend to help you lift the door into place to get it onto the hinges. Thread the pins through the door and jamb portions of the hinge. If your latch hardware is not installed, install the doorknob so that you can test the door. Test your door by opening and closing it again.
