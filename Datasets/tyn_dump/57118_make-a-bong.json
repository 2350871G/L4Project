Any kind of plastic bottle will work, but keep in mind that the larger the bottle is, the bigger the bong hits will be. Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t have the cap to the bottle\u2014you won\u2019t need it! The water you\u2019re putting in the bottle is what the smoke will filter through when you\u2019re smoking the bong. Poke a hole just below the neck of the water bottle to make the carb. The carb is the hole you\u2019ll cover with your finger at first and then let go of so you can inhale the smoke in the bottle. Make the hole large enough for air to easily flow through it, but not so big that you won\u2019t be able to cover it with your finger. You can use any sharp tool to make the hole, like a pen, a knife, or a straightened out paperclip. Be careful that you don\u2019t cut yourself or make the hole too big. Make a second hole slightly above the waterline for the downstem. You\u2019ll put the downstem\u2014the tube with the bowl attached to it\u2014through this hole at an angle so the end inside of the bottle is submerged in the water. Make this hole with the same tool you used to make the first one. Make the hole about the same width as a pen. If it's any smaller, you may have a hard time pushing the downstem through, and if it's any larger, the downstem may be too loose. Use a highlighter and foil to fashion a downstem for the bong. To make the downstem, empty the contents of a highlighter so you\u2019re left with just the hollow plastic tube. You may need to use scissors or pliers to pull the highlighter apart. Then, tear off a small piece of aluminum foil and wrap it around the wide end of the plastic tube. Press the center of the foil down into the tube to make the bowl and poke tiny holes in it so the smoke can get through. If you already have a downstem, you can use that with your plastic bottle bong instead. Push the open end of the downstem through the bottom hole you made. Angle the downstem downward so the open end inside of the bottle is submerged in the water. When you\u2019re finished inserting the downstem, the bowl should be angled upward on the outside of the bottle. If you're having trouble fitting the downstem through the hole, make the hole a little bigger and try again. Be careful not to make the hole too big or the downstem will be too loose. Pack the bowl and try out your new bong. To use your plastic bottle bong, start by covering the carb\u2014the hole you made at the top of the bottle\u2014with your finger. Then, place your mouth on the mouthpiece and light the bowl with a lighter. As you\u2019re lighting the bowl, inhale slowly through your mouth. Once the bottle is full of smoke, take your finger off the carb and breathe the smoke in. If you have the cap to the bottle and you aren\u2019t able to inhale all of the smoke, just put the cap on to trap the leftover smoke inside. Then, when you\u2019re ready for more, take the cap off and breathe in the rest of the smoke. Building a Gravity Bong Cover the mouthpiece of a plastic bottle with foil to make a bowl. The bowl is what you'll pack your smoking substance into before you use the gravity bong. Just take the cap off the bottle, cover the mouthpiece with foil, and press it down with your finger so it\u2019s shaped like a bowl.

Just make sure they\u2019re not so big that the contents of the bowl will fall through. A few holes should be enough. You can always add more later if the smoke isn\u2019t pulling through the bowl. Cut off the bottom 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) of the plastic bottle. This will allow water to get into the bottle later on when you finish assembling the gravity bong. To cut off the bottom of the bottle, carefully pierce it with a knife. Then, use scissors to cut around the bottle until the bottom is completely off. How much you cut off from the bottom doesn\u2019t need to be precise. However, the more you cut off, the smaller the gravity bong hits will be.
