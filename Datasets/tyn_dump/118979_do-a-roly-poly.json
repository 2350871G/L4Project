Depending on the number of rolls you intend to make, determine whether or not you have enough room. If you only intend to perform one roly poly, you may only need a few feet, while much more space will be need for multiple rolls. If you are inside, move any furniture like a coffee table or a chair that may be in your way. If you are outside, ensure the area is clear of any rocks, sticks, etc. that may cause bodily injury. When outdoors, a grassy space is probably best."
