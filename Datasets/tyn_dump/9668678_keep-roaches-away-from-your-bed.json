        "Crush up and spread around some bay leaves as an alternative.",
        "Bay leaves also act a natural roach repellent, as roaches hate the smell of them.",
        "Use a mortar and pestle or any other crushing tools to turn some bay leaves into a powder.",
        "Sprinkle the powder in a few lidless containers and place them around your bedroom and bed.",
        "Make a homemade insecticide out of baking soda and sugar.",
        "While killing roaches won\u2019t solve the problem entirely, it will diminish the roach population in and around your home.",
        "If you\u2019d like to kill them, mix together equal parts baking soda and sugar in a bowl.",
        "Then, simply sprinkle the mixture around your room.",
        "The sugar in the mixture will attract the roaches, while the baking soda, when consumed, will kill them.",
        "Sweep or vacuum up the mixture after a few days and dispose of any dead roaches that you find.",
        "This mixture is safe to use with pets and children in the home.",
        "Use Boric acid for severe circumstances.",
        "Boric acid is one of the most effective products for killing roaches, ants, and other pests.",
        "Purchase some at your local supermarket or online if you have a severe roach issue in your home.",
        "Provide a light dusting of the boric acid on the floor of your bedroom.",
        "This way, when roaches walk through it, they\u2019ll get it on their bodies and later die when they groom themselves and ingest it.",
        "Keep boric acid away from children and pets, as it is poisonous and can be very harmful if consumed.",
        "Don\u2019t forget to vacuum or sweep up the boric acid after a 1-2 days.",
        "Boric acid isn\u2019t effective when it\u2019s wet or sprinkled in excess."
