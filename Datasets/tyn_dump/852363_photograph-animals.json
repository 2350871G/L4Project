Learning about the animal will give you ideas for potential shots and make it easier to locate the animal in the wild. Know the habitat, footprints, calls, sleep patterns, etc. of the animal you want to photograph. For example, knowing that Blue Jays live in eastern and central North America and have a distinct 'jay' call will be useful in locating Blue Jays to photograph. Alternatively, if you are photographing a pet or domestic animal, it is a good idea to spend some time getting to know the animal before you start taking photos. This will help relax the animal and you will be able to get more natural photos."

Blurring the background while focusing on the subject also requires you to use a slow shutter speed, but instead of using a tripod you pan your camera along with the movement of the animal.
