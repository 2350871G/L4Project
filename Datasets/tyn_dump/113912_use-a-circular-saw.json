While operating the saw, you\u2019ll grip the tool by both its front and rear handles and use the trigger on the rear handle to control the movement of the blade. In addition to construction lumber and other types of wood, you can also use a circular saw to modify sheet metal, composite materials, and even rolled steel bar stock. The Right Blade for the Job\nCircular saw blades come in several different sizes. 6.5 in (17 cm) blades are commonly used to cut nominal lumber for construction. 7.25 in (18.4 cm) blades are the standard for lumber up to 2.25 inches (5.7 cm) thick, while 8\u201310 in (20\u201325 cm) saw are often reserved for heavy-duty industrial work."
