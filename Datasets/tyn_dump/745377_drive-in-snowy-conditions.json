Slowly applying the gas and gradually accelerating is the best way to gain traction when you lose traction in your rear tires. While you're driving, decelerating abruptly or making sharp turns at a high rate of speed may cause you to lose control of your vehicle. Try to maintain a speed of 45 mph (72 kilometers) or less. Anticipate times where you'll have to stop and decelerate slowly, far in advance of where you have to stop. Test your car's accelerating, braking, and turning abilities on a clear stretch of road before driving to your destination."

Other drivers may not have the same level of skill when it comes to driving in snow, so they may lose control of their vehicle and cause a collision with your car or truck. Keep your radio turned down so you can hear if other cars are losing control or are honking their horns."
