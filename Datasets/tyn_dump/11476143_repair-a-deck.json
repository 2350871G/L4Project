        "Screw 2 3 in (7.6 cm) decking screws through each end into the joist that it rests on.Tip: If you don\u2019t want to use screws because the existing boards are fixed by nails and you prefer the replacement boards to match, then use galvanized ring shank nails to secure the boards in place.",
        "If you have any replacement boards at the edges of the deck that are hanging off the sides and require angled cuts, you can now trim them with a circular saw using the boards next to them as a guide rail for the blade of the saw.",
        "Cleaning and Staining the Deck Power wash the deck to remove any loose finish, dirt, and stains.",
        "Start at 1 side of the deck and aim the power washer down and away from you at about a 45-degree angle.",
        "Turn the power washer on and swing the jet stream from side to side as you slowly walk forward along the deck.",
        "Pay special attention to any areas that look extra dirty, stained, or have old finish peeling up.Tip: It\u2019s a good idea to check the forecast before you start this process and make sure you have a few clear, dry days.",
        "You will need to let the deck dry several times at different stages, so the whole job will go a lot faster if the weather is good.",
        "You can rent a power washer at many home improvement centers or power tool stores.",
        "Let the deck dry completely.",
        "Wait at least 1 day for the deck to dry out after power washing it.",
        "It might take several days, depending on the weather and how hot it is.",
        "You need the deck to dry before you apply a deck cleaner so that the wood can actually absorb the cleaner and let it do its job.",
        "Work a deck cleaner into the deck with a stiff-bristled brush.",
        "Use a cleaning solution specifically made for cleaning decks.",
        "Follow the instructions to dilute it with water, then apply it to the deck with a stiff-bristled brush, working in sections and scrubbing it in well as you go.",
        "You can get a deck cleaner at a home improvement center.",
        "Make sure you follow any additional instructions for the specific cleaner you buy.",
        "Some may require you to dampen the deck before applying it, for instance.",
        "Rinse the cleaner off with a hose as you go.",
        "Don\u2019t let any sections of the cleaner dry on the deck.",
        "Wait 10-15 minutes after applying the cleaner to a section, then rinse it off thoroughly by spraying it down with a hose.",
        "Rinse off any nearby plants when you are done as well to make sure they don\u2019t have any deck cleaner sitting on them.",
        "Wait until the deck is completely dry again.",
        "Let the deck dry for at least 1 day or longer, depending on the weather.",
        "You need it to be completely dry before staining and sealing it.",
        "If you don\u2019t wait for the deck to dry before staining it, the stain won\u2019t bond well and it can even just wash off after it gets rained on a few times.",
        "Apply 1-2 new coats of stain to the entire deck.",
        "Choose semi-transparent stain so the old wood has a more uniform color and the new wood blends in better.",
        "Use a 2 in (5.1 cm) paint brush to apply stain around the edges of the deck and to any more complicated parts, such as railings.",
        "Use a paint roller to apply the stain to the larger surface areas.",
        "You can use whatever width of roller is most comfortable and efficient for you.",
        "Heavy-duty rollers work best because they will push the stain down into the cracks between deck boards better."
