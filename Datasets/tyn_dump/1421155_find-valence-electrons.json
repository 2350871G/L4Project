These may at first look complicated, but they're just a way to represent the electron orbitals in an atom with letters and numbers and they're easy once you know what you're looking at. Let's look at an example configuration for the element sodium (Na):\n1s2s2p3s\nNotice that this electron configuration is just a repeating string that goes like this:\n(number)(letter)(number)(letter)...\n...and so on. The (number)(letter) chunk is the name of the electron orbital and the  is the number of electrons in that orbital \u2014 that's it! So, for our example, we would say that sodium has 2 electrons in the 1s orbital plus 2 electrons in the 2s orbital plus 6 electrons in the 2p orbital plus 1 electron in the 3s orbital. That's 11 electrons total \u2014 sodium is element number 11, so this makes sense. Keep in mind that each subshell has a certain electron capacity.

When we're dealing with atoms outside of the transition metals, we say that these orbitals form \"orbital shells\" around the nucleus, with each successive shell being further out than the ones before. Besides the very first shell, which can hold only two electrons, each shell can have eight electrons (except, again, when dealing with transition metals.) This is called the Octet Rule. For example, let's say we're looking at the element Boron (B). Since its atomic number is five, we know it has five electrons and its electron configuration looks like this: 1s2s2p. Since the first orbital shell has only two electrons, we know that Boron has two shells: one with two 1s electrons and one with three electrons from the 2s and 2p orbitals. As another example, an element like chlorine (1s2s2p3s3p) will have three orbital shells: one with two 1s electrons, one with two 2s electrons and six 2p electrons, and one with two 3s electrons and five 3p electrons."

        "Once again, the group number of the element you are examining can tell you its valence electrons.",
        "However, for the transition metals, there isn't a pattern you can follow \u2014 group number will usually correspond to a range of possible numbers of valence electrons.",
        "These are:\nGroup 3: 3 valence electrons\nGroup 4: 2 to 4 valence electrons\nGroup 5: 2 to 5 valence electrons\nGroup 6: 2 to 6 valence electrons\nGroup 7: 2 to 7 valence electrons\nGroup 8:  2 or 3 valence electrons\nGroup 9: 2 or 3 valence electrons\nGroup 10: 2 or 3 valence electrons\nGroup 11: 1 or 2 valence electrons\nGroup 12: 2 valence electrons\nIn our example, since Tantalum is in group 5, we can say that it has between two and five valence electrons, depending on the situation.",
        "Finding Valence Electrons With an Electron Configuration Learn how to read an electron configuration.",
        "Another way to find an element's valence electrons is with something called an electron configuration.",
        "These may at first look complicated, but they're just a way to represent the electron orbitals in an atom with letters and numbers and they're easy once you know what you're looking at.",
        "Let's look at an example configuration for the element sodium (Na):\n1s2s2p3s\nNotice that this electron configuration is just a repeating string that goes like this:\n(number)(letter)(number)(letter)...\n...and so on.",
        "The (number)(letter) chunk is the name of the electron orbital and the  is the number of electrons in that orbital \u2014 that's it!",
        "So, for our example, we would say that sodium has 2 electrons in the 1s orbital plus 2 electrons in the 2s orbital plus 6 electrons in the 2p orbital plus 1 electron in the 3s orbital.",
        "That's 11 electrons total \u2014 sodium is element number 11, so this makes sense.",
        "Keep in mind that each subshell has a certain electron capacity.",
        "Their electron capacities are as follows:\ns: 2 electron capacity\np: 6 electron capacity\nd:10 electron capacity\nf: 14 electron capacity Find the electron configuration for the element you are examining.",
        "Once you know an element's electron configuration, finding its number of valence electrons is quite simple (except, of course, for the transition metals.)",
        "If you're given the configuration from the get-go, you can skip to the next step.",
        "If you have to find it yourself, see below:\nExamine complete electron configuration for oganesson (Og), element 118, which is the last element on the periodic table.",
        "It has the most electrons of any element, so its electron configuration demonstrates all of the possibilities you could encounter in other elements:\n1s2s2p3s3p4s3d4p5s4d5p6s4f5d6p7s5f6d7p\nNow that you have this, all you need to do to find another atom's electron configuration is just fill in this pattern from the beginning until you run out of electrons.",
        "This is easier than it sounds.",
        "For example, if we want to make the orbital diagram for chlorine (Cl), element 17, which has 17 electrons, we would do it like this:\n1s2s2p3s3p\nNotice that the number of electrons adds up to 17: 2 + 2 + 6 + 2 + 5 = 17.",
        "You only need to change the number in the final orbital \u2014 the rest is the same since the orbitals before the final one are completely full.",
        "For more on electron configurations, see also this article.",
        "Assign electrons to orbital shells with the Octet Rule.",
        "As electrons are added to an atom, they fall into various orbitals according to the order given above \u2014 the first two go into the 1s orbital, the two after that go into the 2s orbital, the six after that go into the 2p orbital, and so on.",
        "When we're dealing with atoms outside of the transition metals, we say that these orbitals form \"orbital shells\" around the nucleus, with each successive shell being further out than the ones before.",
        "Besides the very first shell, which can hold only two electrons, each shell can have eight electrons (except, again, when dealing with transition metals.)",
        "This is called the Octet Rule.",
        "For example, let's say we're looking at the element Boron (B).",
        "Since its atomic number is five, we know it has five electrons and its electron configuration looks like this: 1s2s2p.",
        "Since the first orbital shell has only two electrons, we know that Boron has two shells: one with two 1s electrons and one with three electrons from the 2s and 2p orbitals.",
        "As another example, an element like chlorine (1s2s2p3s3p) will have three orbital shells: one with two 1s electrons, one with two 2s electrons and six 2p electrons, and one with two 3s electrons and five 3p electrons.",
        "Find the number of electrons in the outermost shell.",
        "Now that you know your element's electron shells, finding the valence electrons is easy: just use the number of electrons in the outermost shell.",
        "If the outer shell is full (in other words, if it has eight electrons or, for the first shell, two), the element is inert and will not react easily with other elements.",
        "Again, however, things don't quite follow these rules for transition metals.",
        "For example, if we're working with Boron, since there are three electrons in the second shell, we can say that Boron has three valence electrons.",
        "Use the rows of the table as orbital shell shortcuts.",
        "The horizontal rows of the periodic table are called the element \"periods.\"",
        "Starting from the top of the table, each period corresponds to the number of electron shells the atoms in the period possess.",
        "You can use this as a shortcut to determine how many valence electrons an element has \u2014 just start from the left side of its period when counting electrons.",
        "Once again, you'll want to ignore the transition metals with this method, which includes groups 3-12.",
        "For example, we know the element selenium has four orbital shells because it is in the fourth period.",
        "Since it is the sixth element from the left in the fourth period (ignoring the transition metals), we know that the outer fourth shell has six electrons, and, thus, that Selenium has six valence electrons."
