        "If you have a fabric marker that will show up on your fabric, you can use it to draw a face on your teddy bear.",
        "Draw eyes, a nose, and a mouth.",
        "Make your bear look happy, sad, grumpy, or surprised depending on what you want.",
        "For example, you could draw 2 circles with dots in the center of them and raised eyebrows for a look of surprise, a big toothy grin for a happy bear, or a straight line for a neutral expression.Tip: Make sure that the marker is permanent so it won\u2019t fade or wash off the first time you launder the bear.",
        "Sew 3 buttons on for a pair of eyes and a nose.",
        "This will give your bear a cute, homemade look.",
        "Thread a needle and sew 2 buttons onto the face for the eyes.",
        "Sew 1 button on for the nose.",
        "Insert the needle in and out of the fabric and all holes in each button to secure them well.",
        "Then, cut the thread as close to the button as possible.",
        "You may want to sew the buttons onto the fabric before you sew the 2 pieces together.",
        "This will enable you to tie knots on the back side of the fabric, which will make the buttons more secure.",
        "Try using 2 like-sized buttons for the eyes and a larger button for the nose.",
        "Glue on eyes, nose, and a mouth if you don\u2019t want to draw or sew.",
        "Another way to attach your bear\u2019s facial features is to use fabric glue or hot-glue to secure them.",
        "Choose buttons, plastic eyes, or cut out fabric facial features.",
        "Apply the glue to the fabric where you want to attach the buttons, plastic eyes, or fabric facial features and then press them into place.",
        "Let the fabric glue dry overnight, or let the hot glue dry for 30 minutes.",
        "Don\u2019t move the teddy bear until the glue has dried completely.",
        "If using hot glue, let the glue gun warm up for at least 10 minutes before using it.",
        "Be careful not to get any of the glue on your skin since it can burn you.",
        "Add extra embellishments to personalize your bear.",
        "As a special finishing touch for your bear, tie a ribbon around its neck, put a teddy bear t-shirt on it, or write its name on a small scrap of fabric and glue it onto the bear like a nametag.",
        "You can also draw on the bear, add extra buttons, or glue patches onto it if desired.",
        "For example, you could glue 3 buttons in a vertical row on the bear\u2019s stomach to give the appearance of shirt buttons.",
        "Or, get a heart-shaped patch and glue it onto the bear\u2019s chest where its heart would be."
