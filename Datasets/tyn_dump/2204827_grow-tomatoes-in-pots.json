A growing plant will produce tomatoes quicker, but you may have more variety to choose from if you buy seeds. If you purchase a tomato plant, look for one that is a healthy green color with whole leaves untouched by pests. Both BushSteak and Patio Princess tomato plants do well in containers and produce ample fruit. If you are looking for a cherry tomato variety, try the Sweet Baby Girl plant. Some \u2018early\u2019 tomato plants will develop fruit within 45 days of planting. However, it usually takes a healthy plant 80 days to create fruit. If you plant from a seed, then you\u2019ll need to include an additional 20 days for germination and seedling growth."

        "Your tomato plants need between 4-6 hours of total sun per day in order to grow and eventually produce fruit.",
        "If needed, place your pots on dollies and roll them to where they\u2019ll get sun.",
        "You can also set your pots in front of a sun lamp indoors.",
        "Keep the sun lamp at least 6 inches (15 cm) away from the pots to avoid burning the plants.",
        "If you\u2019ve planted tomato seeds, keep them warm at night by covering the top of each pot tightly with plastic wrap.",
        "Then, remove it at the start of each day.",
        "Wrap nylon netting around the tomato cage.",
        "Position the netting so that it encloses the entire cage, including the top.",
        "Then, fold the netting over the upper cage rims.",
        "Secure the netting to the rims using clothespins or other sturdy clips.",
        "The netting helps to keep insects, such as tomato worms and stink bugs, away from the plant.",
        "It also helps to filter the sun\u2019s rays to prevent leaf burning.",
        "If you do find insects on your plants, try using a mild insecticide.",
        "There are both natural and manufactured options available, depending on the offending pest.",
        "Be sure to thoroughly rinse any insecticide-treated tomatoes before you eat them.",
        "Water your tomatoes as often as necessary in order to keep the soil moist.",
        "If the soil is dry for .5 in (1.3 cm) down or if your plants look slightly wilted at the end of the day, then they need to be watered.",
        "Keep watering until you see water coming out of the pot\u2019s bottom drain holes.",
        "This means that the water has saturated the soil from top to bottom.",
        "Vary your watering schedule depending on the season and temperature.",
        "On hot days, you may need to water daily.",
        "When the weather is mild, once weekly might suffice.",
        "When you are finished watering, drain off any remaining water from the saucer.",
        "Letting the water sit in the saucer can cause root rot.",
        "Try to water your tomatoes during the daytime.",
        "Evening or nighttime water can encourage the growth of fungus.",
        "Harvest your tomatoes one-by-one once they develop their red color.",
        "The fruits should almost be completely red with only trace amounts of green remaining.",
        "Ripe tomatoes can be plucked by gently pulling at the stem with your fingers.",
        "Or, use a pair of garden shears to snip them off their branches.",
        "Note that some varieties of tomatoes (check your variety) are naturally striped, green, or otherwise not like an ordinary red tomato when mature."
