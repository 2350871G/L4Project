Fertilizing your hydrangea plants too close to winter will encourage the growth of new, fragile blooms that will be vulnerable in the cold. Avoid feeding your plants in the fall so they have a better chance of withstanding winter conditions. Applying too much fertilizer at any time of the year may help the plant's leaves grow while hindering its flowers from blooming in the spring."

To sift mulch, place it on a screen and shake the screen so the smaller particles fall through.
