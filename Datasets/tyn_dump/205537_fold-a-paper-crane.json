    "text": " Get a blank square sheet of paper. If you're working with square origami paper, that's great. Fold it so the color is facing out. If you have an ordinary piece of printer paper, just fold one of the top corners across the paper until it aligns with the bottom edge of the sheet, leaving a long strip of rectangular paper. Cut the strip to make the paper square. Fold the paper in half into a rectangle.  Fold the top of the paper down until the top edge aligns with bottom edge of the paper and then crease. Unfold the paper. Fold it in half the other way.  Fold vertically from right to left.  Crease, then unfold. You should end up with a cross crease. Fold the top right corner down to the bottom left corner.  Crease, then unfold.  Fold the top left corner down to the bottom right corner.  Crease, then unfold. You should end up with an asterisk-like crease. Bring the lower right side of the top flap to the middle line. Crease. Repeat on the lower left side. You'll have a top that resembles a kite. Bring the right corner of the top flap to the middle crease. This will make it so that the lower right edge lines up with the crease. Fold down the top corner to make the crease lie along the horizontal line created by the previous step.  Unfold the last three folds. After you do this, you'll return to having a square with an opening that faces down. Fold the bottom corner of the square up along the horizontal crease from the previous steps up to the top corner.  Reverse the two creases on the upper flap by folding it in the opposite direction that it naturally folds.  Bring the outer edges of the paper to the middle and flatten it. This will create a diamond shape with two flaps sticking out on the right and left sides. Turn the paper over and repeat steps 6-9 on this side.  Fold the outer edges of the diamond to the middle crease.  Fold the right flap over to the left. Do this as you would turn the page of a book. Turn over the shape. Repeat on this side. Then fold the right flap over to the left again. Fold the bottom tip of the top flap up to the top corner. Turn over and repeat on the other side. Fold the right flap over to the left. Again, do this as you would turn the page of a book. Turn over and repeat on the back. Now the head and tail are nestled in between what will become the wings. Fold the wings down so that they are perpendicular to the body, head, and tail.  Fold the tip of the head down.  Pull the head and tail out so that they line up with the outer edges of the body.  Create 3D volume. If you want a three dimensional body, grasp the opposite corners on the bottom of the body and gently pull the shape to create the desired volume. Or you can blow in the hole at the bottom of the crane. Enjoy your paper crane. You can give away the crane, hang it up, or use it as a decoration.",
