Wrap the yarn around your fingers twice and then take the loops off your fingers, keeping them together. Then, insert your J-10 (6.0 mm) crochet hook into the center of the loop and wrap the yarn over the end of it. Pull the loop through the center of the 2 loops while keeping them together. Then, yarn over again and pull through the other loop on your hook to slipstitch around the ring and secure it. You can use a cotton or cotton-blend yarn to make the magic ring. Crochet a chain of 2. Loop the working yarn over the crochet hook and then pull through the other loop that\u2019s on it. This will make 1 chain. Yarn over the hook again and then pull it through the loop on the hook to make the second chain. Half-double crochet 11 times into the ring. Loop the yarn over the crochet hook and insert it into the center of the ring. Then, yarn over the hook again and pull through 1 loop. Then, yarn over again and pull the yarn through all 3 loops left on the hook to complete 1 stitch. Repeat this for a total of 11 half-double crochet stitches worked into the center of the ring. The first slipstitch you made will count as a stitch, so the total number of stitches in this round will be 12. Slipstitch to connect the last stitch to the first stitch in the round. After you work the last half-double crochet stitch in the round, insert your hook into the top of the first stitch in the round. Loop the yarn over the hook and pull it through the stitch and the loop on your hook. This will connect the ends of the round. Repeat this at the end of every round to ensure that the ends are connected. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be working in a spiral pattern which can make your bag look uneven. Chain 2 and half-double crochet into the same space. To begin the second round, make a chain of 2. Then, yarn over and insert the hook into the base of the chain. Yarn over again and pull through 1. Loop the yarn over again and pull through 3 to complete the stitch. Work a half-double crochet 2 times into each stitch in the round. Repeat the same process for working a half-double crochet stitch, but work 2 stitches into each stitch space in the round. This will double the total number of stitches in the round. At the end of the increase round, your total number of stitches will be 24. Slipstitch to connect the ends of the round. Just as you did for the first round, insert the hook into the first stitch in the round after working your last half-double crochet. Then, yarn over and pull through the stitch and the loop to secure the ends together. Chain 2 and half-double crochet into the same space. Start this round and all other rounds for the base of the bag the same way. Make a chain of 2 stitches and then work 1 half-double crochet into the same space the chain is attached to or the base of the chain. The chain of 2 counts as 1 stitch and the half-double crochet counts as 1. Half-double crochet 1 time into the next 2 spaces. Next, work a single half-double crochet stitch into the next 2 stitches in the round. Yarn over, insert the hook into the stitch, yarn over again and pull through 1. Then, yarn over a third time and pull through 3 to complete the stitch. Half-double crochet 2 times into the next space. After working a single half-double crochet stitch into 2 consecutive spaces, work 2 half-double crochet stitches into the same space. This will count as an increase. You\u2019ll work a total of 12 increases for this round and all other rounds after this one to get the desired base size for the backpack. Repeat the sequence to the end of the round. Continue to follow the sequence of working 1 half-double crochet into 2 consecutive spaces and then 2 half-double crochets into 1 space. Repeat this until the end of the third round. When you get to the end of round 3, look for a total of 36 stitches. Tip: If you end up with 1 more or 1 less than you\u2019re supposed to have, work an extra increase or a decrease to adjust the total in the next round. Slipstitch to connect the beginning and end of the round. Insert the hook into the first stitch in the round just as before and yarn over. Pull through the stitch and the loop on the hook to connect the beginning and end of the round. Continue to increase until the backpack base is the desired size. You can work as many rounds as you like to get the desired backpack size. Working 9 rounds will yield a backpack that is about 11 by 11 in (28 by 28 cm). Complete increases for each round as follows:\nRound 3: Increase every third stitch\nRound 4: Increase every fourth stitch\nRound 5: Increase every fifth stitch\nRound 6: Increase every sixth stitch\nRound 7: Increase every seventh stitch\nRound 8: Increase every eighth stitch\nRound 9: Increase every ninth stitchTip: Don\u2019t forget to slipstitch at the end of each round to secure the ends! Expanding the Body of the Bag Chain 2 and half-double crochet 1 time into every stitch in the round. Loop the yarn over the hook, pull it through, then yarn over and pull through again for a second chain. Then, work 1 half-double crochet stitch into every stitch in the round. Do not work any increases.Tip: Once you have completed the base of the bag, do not cut the yarn. Keep using the same yarn to work the body. Slipstitch to secure the ends of the round. Insert the hook into the first stitch in the round, yarn over the hook, and pull it through the stitch and the loop that\u2019s on the hook. This will secure the ends together. It\u2019s important to secure the ends of the rounds together rather than working in a spiral pattern. This will help to ensure that the top edge of the backpack is even all the way around. Repeat the round until the backpack is the desired length. You can work as many rounds as you like to get the desired size backpack. If you work 28 rows, your backpack will be about 11 in (28 cm) long. If you work 38 rows, your backpack will be 15 in (38 cm) long. If you work 50 rows, the backpack will be 20 in (51 cm) long. Change colors after completing a round if desired. If you want the body of the bag to have multiple colors in it, then you could switch at any point. Try changing colors 1/3 of the way up the bag, such as after 6-8 rows. Or, change colors halfway through the body, such as at 14 rows. You can use any color combination you like, or just stick with one color for the entire bag. Variegated yarns are also a good option since they alternate between different colors, so your bag will have a multi-color look without the hassle of changing yarns. Secure the ends of the last round with a slipstitch. Once you get to the ends of the last round, insert the hook through the first stitch in the row, yarn over the hook, and pull it through the stitch and the loop on your hook. This will secure the beginning and the end of the round. Creating the Flap Chain 1 and work 1 half-double crochet into the same space. Wrap the yarn over the hook and pull it through the loop. This will make 1 chain. Then, work 1 half-double crochet stitch into the stitch at the base of the chain.Tip: If desired, you could work the flap in a decorative stitch, such as the shell stitch or waffle stitch. Half-double crochet into the next 18 stitches. Work the half-double crochet stitches as usual. Loop the yarn over the hook, insert the hook into the stitch, yarn over again, and pull through 1. Then, yarn over and pull through 3 to complete the stitch. Chain 1, turn your work, and half-double crochet back across the row. Loop the yarn over the hook and pull through 1 to make a chain. Then, turn your work around before you start doing half-double crochet stitches. Turning your work will allow you to crochet back and forth across the row to create a flap on the top edge of the bag. Continue to work the flap row until it is the desired length. Repeat the last row and keep repeating it until your flap is the desired size. You can make the flap as big as you want, but working about 13 rows should be about 5 in (13 cm) long or enough to cover the opening of the bag. You can make a longer flap by working more rows, such as 18 rows for a 7 in (18 cm) long flap. Cut and tie off the yarn when you finish the flap. Once the flap is the desired size, cut the yarn about 6 in (15 cm) from the last stitch. Then, pull the loop out and remove the hook. Insert the free end of the yarn through the loop to form a knot. Finishing the Backpack Braid 6 strands of yarn together to form a drawstring. Cut 6 strands of yarn that are each about 55 in (140 cm) long. Then, tie the ends of the yarn together in a knot. Form 3 clumps of 2 strands each and braid the yarn by alternating the strands. Continue braiding until you reach the end of the strands and then tie another knot through the end to secure the braid.Tip: You can also use cord material for a drawstring. Check your local craft supply store to see what types of cord they have and choose something that will go well with your bag. Thread the braid through the stitches along the opening of the bag. Insert the end of the braid through a stitch along the bag\u2019s opening, near where the middle of the flap falls. Then, bring the end out about 3 stitch spaces from there.

Choose a button that is small enough to fit through a stitch, but large enough that it won\u2019t slip right back out. Thread a needle with 24 in (61 cm) of yarn, pull until the ends are even, and then tie them in a double knot. Make sure to sew in and out of all of the holes in the button 6-8 times to ensure that it is secured. Use a needle that fits easily through your button\u2019s holes for ease of sewing. Crochet straps or sew canvas straps to the back of the bag. To add straps to your bag, you can either make them by crocheting them and sewing them onto your bag or by purchasing canvas straps in a craft supply store and sewing them onto the bag. 21 in (53 cm) long. To crochet the straps, make a chain of 5, then work across the chain in the half-double crochet stitch. Work back and forth across the row until it measure 21 in (53 cm) long. Then, sew the straps onto the backside of the bag using a yarn needle. To sew canvas straps onto the bag, cut the straps so they are each about 21 in (53 cm) long. Then, thread a needle with 18 in (46 cm) of thread that matches your backpack and sew each end to the backside of the backpack. You may want to pin the straps to the backpack first to check the positioning.",
