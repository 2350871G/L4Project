        "The capstan is the white plastic part that you wind the string around.",
        "You can pull the string back either above or below the capstan depending on your preference.",
        "Pull the 6th string tight until there is about 4 inches (10 cm) of slack in the middle of the neck.",
        "You want to leave some slack so that you can tune the guitar without risk of breaking the new string.",
        "This would be a good time to double check that the knot you made in the bridge is secure.",
        "Guide the string back through the loop above the capstan.",
        "You can do this either once or twice depending on your preference.",
        "This should keep the string secure when you wind it up.",
        "Use your finger or a winder to rotate the tuning peg to tighten the string.",
        "Hold the loose string and tighten it up the same way you would to tune your guitar.",
        "Keep winding until the string is in tune.",
        "You can let go of the loose string after a while.",
        "Cut off any excess string with a wire cutter.",
        "If there is any string sticking out from the head of the guitar, be sure to use a wire cutter to safely remove it.",
        "Otherwise, you could accidentally hurt yourself on the string when you go to play your guitar.",
        "Repeat this process for every string.",
        "Working in order from the 6th string to the 1st string one at a time can help make it easier to properly attach the new strings to the neck of the guitar.",
        "Be careful not to tighten the strings so much that they snap, just like when you tune your guitar normally.",
        "After you've attached all of your new strings use a tuner to help you get your guitar back in tune.",
        "Alternatively, you can attach the new E string before you remove the old A string, and tune the guitar to itself.",
        "To do this, play the E string at the 5th fret and match it to the sound of the A string."
