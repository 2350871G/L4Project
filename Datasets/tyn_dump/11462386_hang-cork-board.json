        "If you\u2019re using furring strips, place these in parallel horizontal lines along the wall using screws and attach the plywood to the strips using nails or screws as well.",
        "Attach the screws to the wall around the border of the plywood, roughly every 1 ft (0.30 m).",
        "Furring strips are pieces of wood that act as a buffer between the plywood and the wall so you don\u2019t have to place so many nails or screws into the wall.",
        "Try to attach the plywood to studs whenever possible.",
        "Locate the studs in your wall using a stud finder.",
        "Apply a strong adhesive glue to the wood or wall.",
        "Spread the adhesive on the plywood using a trowel or spatula.",
        "Cover the plywood in an even layer, creating texture with a trowel to make it easier for the cork to adhere to the plywood.",
        "Look for a strong adhesive at your local hardware store that works with cork, such as industrial strength or permanent types of glue.",
        "Be ready to immediately put up the cork board once you\u2019ve applied the adhesive.",
        "Line the edges of the cork board with the edges of the wall or wood.",
        "Pick up the piece of cork board and line the top edges of the cork board with the top edges of the plywood or wall.",
        "Place the cork board on the wood or wall slowly to ensure it\u2019s even, pressing down on the cork board to help it stick.",
        "Have a friend help you do this to make the process easier.",
        "Use a rolling pin to help adhere the cork board to the wall evenly.",
        "Once the cork board is lined up on top of the wood or wall, use a rolling pin from the kitchen to flatten the cork board against the surface.",
        "Keep rolling the cork board for several minutes, applying a slight pressure to help the cork board stick to the wood or wall.",
        "Don\u2019t worry if the cork board doesn\u2019t immediately flatten against the wall.",
        "As you continue rolling it with a rolling pin, it will start to stick to the wall."
