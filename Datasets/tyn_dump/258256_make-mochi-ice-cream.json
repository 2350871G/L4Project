The flavor, brand, or type of ice cream you use is entirely up to you and your preferences. Use a single flavor of ice cream, or use a different flavor for each mochi ball. You will need at least 2-3 cups (300-450 g) of ice cream to make 10 mochi balls, so purchase a standard \u00bd gallon (1,200 g) container of ice cream. Pick traditional vanilla or chocolate ice cream for a simple taste. Experiment with more complicated flavors like mint chocolate chip, rocky road, or cookie dough. Use strawberry, matcha, or black sesame ice cream for a savory taste that is more traditional to mochi ice cream sold in Japan."

        "Make the sheet of mochi about \u20448 in (0.32 cm) thick.",
        "Work from the center of the dough outwards to keep the edges of the sheet from getting too thin.",
        "The center of the dough should roughly be the same thickness as the edges of the dough.",
        "The sheet can be a rough circle or rectangle shape, as either will work well when cutting the mochi.",
        "If you are worried the mochi will stick to your rolling pin, rub some of the starch onto the rolling pin as well.",
        "Cut out 10 circles using a 3.5 in (8.9 cm) round cookie cutter.",
        "Prevent the mochi from sticking to the cookie cutter by rubbing starch on it.",
        "Start at one side of the mochi sheet and work your way over to the other side.",
        "If you have to, gather the mochi scraps and roll it back out again so you can cut out more circles.",
        "If you do not have a round cookie cutter, you can coat the rim of a glass and use that instead.",
        "Put the mochi discs onto a baking sheet and chill them in the refrigerator.",
        "Cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap to keep the mochi from drying out in the refrigerator.",
        "Check on the mochi discs after 30 minutes to see if they are cold to touch.",
        "If the mochi discs are still warm, allow them to continue chilling in the refrigerator.",
        "Once the mochi discs are fully chilled, you are ready to begin assembling the mochi ice cream balls.",
        "Covering the Ice Cream Line your counter with a small piece of plastic wrap.",
        "Cut the piece of plastic wrap so it is at least twice the size of the mochi ball.",
        "The plastic wrap will be used to individually package the finished mochi balls.",
        "You can reuse one of the plastic wrap pieces you used to cover the ice balls.",
        "But if the piece of plastic wrap is damaged or if it does not look big enough to cover the entire ball, get a new piece to line the counter.",
        "Place an ice cream ball on a mochi circle and rest it on the plastic wrap.",
        "Use a spoon or your fingers to quickly place the ice cream in the center of the mochi sheet.",
        "Either hold the mochi sheet in the palm of your hand or have the sheet already resting on the plastic wrap to do this.",
        "Pick which method is easiest for you.",
        "Handle the ice cream as little as possible to keep it from melting before you wap it in the mochi.",
        "Leave the cupcake tin with the rest of the balls in the freezer to keep those from melting while you work.",
        "Lift the edges of the mochi circle to cover the ice cream ball.",
        "Stretch the mochi sheet with your fingers as needed to cover the entire ice cream ball.",
        "The chilled dough may be tough to stretch at first so be patient.",
        "Pinch the dough edges closed at the top of the ice cream ball.",
        "The covered ice cream ball will roughly resemble a cinched coin purse.",
        "Smooth out the puckered edges along the top with your finger.",
        "Be careful not to tear the mochi dough while doing this.",
        "If there is a lot of extra dough pinched at the top of the ice cream ball, use scissors to cut away the extra dough.",
        "Save the excess dough in case you need to patch a hole or cover a thin spot while making the rest of the mochi balls.",
        "Package the mochi ball with the plastic wrap to keep the dough fresh.",
        "Cover the entire mochi ball with the plastic wrap, so that none of the dough is exposed.",
        "The plastic wrap will keep the dough from drying out in the freezer, and will also help the ball maintain its shape until the ice cream and dough firm up.",
        "Rest the packaged mochi ball in the cupcake tin in the freezer.",
        "Place any obvious seams in the plastic wrap casing down into the cup.",
        "This will keep the plastic wrap from peeling off the mochi ball as it freezes.",
        "Repeat this process until the remaining 9 ice cream balls are all covered with mochi and packaged in plastic wrap.",
        "Allow the mochi balls to finish firming in the freezer for 2 hours.",
        "This will give the handled ice cream a chance to harden.",
        "When you are ready to eat a mochi ice cream ball, let the ball sit at room temperature for 5-10 minutes to allow the mochi dough to soften so you do not hurt your teeth when you bite into it."
