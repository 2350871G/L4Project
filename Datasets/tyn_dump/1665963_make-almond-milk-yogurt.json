Blend 1 cup (0.237 L) almonds and 2 1/2 cups (0.59 L) water in a food processor. Strain the almond milk mixture to remove unblended parts of the nuts from the liquid. You can use cheesecloth, a tea ball, or a nut milk bag available from specialty foods stores for this step."

Many culture starter products recommend preparing the culture starter and almond milk mix when the almond milk is at room temperature. If necessary, you can warm the yogurt on a low setting on the stove."

An automatic yogurt maker will alert you when the fermentation process is complete. If you do not have a yogurt maker, you can put the almond mixture into a Dutch oven and place it in an oven on the warm setting for 4 to 6 hours, place it into an insulated thermos for 8 hours (transfer the mixture to a clean container for cooling in the next step), or place it into a sealed crock pot that you have warmed but unplugged for 8 hours."
