                    "description": "As it doesn't contain any of the milk solids or water found in butter, ghee has a much higher smoke point. Use ghee instead of cooking oils or butter in almost any recipe to add a slight buttery and nutty flavor. The smoke point is the temperature at which something will begin to burn and smoke. Butter has a smoke point around 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C), whereas the smoke point of ghee is around 465 \u00b0F (241 \u00b0C). For comparison, the smoke point of olive oil is around 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C), and the smoke point for sunflower oil is 440 \u00b0F (227 \u00b0C). Use ghee only as a replacement for butter in cooking, and not in baking. Ghee is oil more than it is butter, so your baked goods might not work quite as well if you use ghee instead. Ghee can be used as a replacement for oils in baking, however."

                    "description": "Tadka is a widely utilized concept in Indian cuisine, where whole herbs and spices are toasted in ghee to infuse the ghee with flavor. Try heating 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of ghee in a saucepan on high, before adding roughly 1 teaspoon (2 g) of cumin seeds and toasting for around 5 minutes. Add it to the water used when cooking rice for an extra burst of flavor. Tadka can be made with almost any whole herb or spice and added at the beginning or end of cooking for extra flavor. For the best results, make the tadka just before you have to use it. If made in advance and kept in the fridge, it will lose a lot of the aroma that makes it so flavorful."

        "Skim the milk solids from the top of the butterfat.",
        "As the milk solids cook and rise to the top of the butter, use a mesh skimmer or spoon to skim them away.",
        "Continue skimming the white milk solids until they begin to turn brown, and the butterfat itself becomes a golden color.",
        "You can also leave the milk solids to cook and brown by themselves and without skimming them.",
        "This will just mean you have more cooked solids to strain away.",
        "Strain the melted ghee through a cheesecloth.",
        "Place a mesh sieve over a bowl or jug with a spout, and cover it with two layers of a fine cheesecloth.",
        "Take the melted butter off of the heat and leave it to cool for 2 to 3 minutes before straining through the cloth.",
        "Discard of any remaining milk solids caught in the cheesecloth and keep the pure, melted ghee.",
        "If you have a jar funnel, you can strain the melted ghee directly into the jar in which you want to store it.",
        "Make sure to place a sieve and cheesecloth over the top of the funnel to strain the ghee properly.",
        "Store the ghee in an air-tight container for up to 2 months.",
        "While the ghee is still hot, pour it into a glass jar or other airtight container.",
        "Cover the ghee and store it in your pantry for up to 2 months, making sure to keep the container air-tight and free from any moisture or steam.",
        "You can also store the ghee in your refrigerator for up to 6 months.",
        "This will make the ghee more solid and harder to scoop out, but it will also last for much longer.",
        "If you let any water, steam, or moisture into your ghee container, you should store the ghee in the fridge to stop it from going bad.",
        "Use it within 1 month.",
        "Ghee kept at room temperature will be soft, but not liquid."
