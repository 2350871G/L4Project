    "text": " Clean the yoga mat.  Identify the two sides, textured and smooth.  Trace a flip flop or shoe that's your size on the smooth side.  Cut out what you traced.  Flip it over and trace it on the smooth side, cutting it out so you now have a right and left foot.  Trace and cut out four more for both the right and left and you'll have a total of five cut-outs for each foot.  Stack the cut-outs for each foot, textured side up.  Glue four of the layers together with a hot glue gun. Glue a little, then press. Then glue a little more, and press. If you try to glue the whole layer at once, it'll start to dry before you push the layers together. Put the fifth, unglued layer on the floor, textured side up. Put your foot on it and mark the spot between your big toe and second toe. Slice the mark open with a razor.  Cut a strip from the leftover mat that's about 3/4\" wide, and 2.5 times the length of the flip flop.  Put one end of the strap through the hole.  Bring the strap around and under the flip flop, making sure the smooth side of the strap faces the outer edge of the flip flop.  Bring the other end of the strap through the hole and cut the excess.  Try it on and adjust the straps through the hole until you have a comfortable fit.  Trim both sides of the strip on the bottom of the flip flop as needed. Then glue them down with a hot glue gun. Glue down the middle part with a hot glue gun.  Glue this layer onto the other four layers. Add more pressure for a longer time at the middle and around the toe because of the straps sandwiched in between. Repeat the steps above to create another flip flop.  Flip your flip flops over and use a glue gun to create treads on the bottom. Allow to dry.",
