If you can\u2019t find choko fruit at a local grocery store, you could try searching online for a mail order company. Seeds are hard to separate from the fruit and aren\u2019t often sold on their own, but you might be able to track some down online. Place the fruit on its side in a soil-filled container. Fill a gallon-sized (about 4 liters) container with potting soil, and make a little hole in the soil for the fruit. Place the fruit on its side in the soil so the tip of the stem points at a 45 degree angle. Cover the fruit with soil, but make sure the tip of the stem still shows. Keep the container in warm, dry place. Find a dark place with good ventilation to store the fruit until it sprouts. If possible, keep the temperature between 80 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit (about 27 to 29 degrees Celsius). Water it occasionally, or when the soil completely dries out. The sprout should emerge in about one month. A pantry, under the sink, or a closet (with the door cracked) are all good spots to sprout your fruit.

The vines will start to grow wildly, so you\u2019ll need to train them to grab onto the trellis or fence.
