                    "description": "After you've planned the perimeter for your wall, you can calculate the amount of materials you need. First, calculate the cubic feet of the wall you\u2019re planning. The formula for cubic feet is length x width x height. Use this formula for each section of your stem wall. Then, find out the volume of the brick type you plan on using. Divide the volume of each pack of bricks into the volume of your wall to find out how many packs you need. For example, if you\u2019re building a rectangle structure and your wall will be 6 feet (1.8 m) long, 1 foot (0.30 m) thick, and 4 feet (1.2 m) high, you need 96 cubic feet (2.7 m) of material for that section. Then multiply that by 4 to get 384 cubic feet (10.9 m) for the whole wall. Use a different formula if you are calculating the volume of a circular structure. If a pack of bricks has a volume of 20 cubic feet (0.57 m) and the total volume for your wall is 384 cubic feet (10.9 m), then you need 20 packs of bricks. If you\u2019re having the stones delivered, ask the drivers to place the stones as close to your building site as possible so you don\u2019t have to carry them long distances."
