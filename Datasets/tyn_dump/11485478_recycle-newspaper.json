This way you\u2019ll cut back on greenhouse emissions by limiting the number of trips to the plant. Unless the plant has a special focus on materials that are difficult to process, the recycling plant near you will have no problem taking your newspaper.

Choose to set up a composting bin or box if you want to keep your compost contained. If you have a large yard, a free-standing pile is perfectly fine.Tip: Greens include leaves, lawn trimmings, food waste, coffee grounds, and manure. Browns include dried leaves, straw, twigs, lint, and paper. You need a mix of \u201cgreen\u201d and \u201cbrown\u201d materials to compost. Green materials refer to organics that are usually green, like plants, flowers, and food waste. Browns tend to be white or brown. Newspapers count as a brown for composting purposes, even if they are white or gray in color. Get a bin with a lid if you\u2019re worried about smell.

Since newspaper takes longer to break down than standard organic waste and can blow away in the wind, lay it out flat in the bottom half of your bin to keep it weighed down. You can add any number of layers, but the more you add, the longer it will take to break down. It doesn\u2019t matter what type of newspaper you use or how many layers you add. The bigger your compost pile is, the longer it will take to break down, though. Incorporate your newspaper in thinner layers if you want them to compost as quickly as possible. Include a mixed set of green and brown layers for maximum effectiveness. Add your compost by hand or with a shovel.
