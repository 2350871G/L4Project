Here are a few delicious options:\nOlive oil, salt, black pepper (or lemon pepper), garlic powder, ground habanero pepper. Go easy on the salt and pepper, to avoid overpowering the tomato flavor. 1 cup (240 mL) olive oil, \u00bc cup (60 mL) white vinegar, \u00bc cup (60 mL) sugar, and 1 tbsp (15 mL) anchovy paste. Add parsley once cooled, and top the tomatoes with feta. To turn a marinade into a crust, mash breadcrumbs into it until soggy.
