You could buy a wig, but if you plan on doing your hair yourself, you should begin practicing early. In order to achieve Marie Antoinette hair, you need a filler - I used a ball of yarn. You place the filler on your head, pin it in place, and pin your hair over it to cover it. When you're done achieving tall hair, decorate it similarly to the way you decorated the dress. Rosettes, pearls, roses, etc."
