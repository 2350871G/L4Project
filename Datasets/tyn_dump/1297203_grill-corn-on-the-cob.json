The stalks should be a light yellow and the ends of the silks a light brown. While you are at the market, don't be afraid to peel back the husks just enough to reveal a few rows of kernels. They should be white or pale yellow, look nice and plump and be tightly packed into straight rows from one end of the cob to the other. Fresh, young corn is full of natural sugars which will caramelize beautifully over the heat of the grill. As the corn ages, these turn into much less flavorful starches. If the ear has an unusually thick layer of husks, remove the outermost two or three before you continue."
