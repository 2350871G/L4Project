        "You may have to put your name on a sign in sheet.",
        "Become involved as a member of the school board if you're old enough.",
        "If you or anyone in your group is the minimum age to run (sometimes only 18 years old), then consider having them gather the required amount of signatures, and filling out the forms to register to be on the ballot for the next school board election.",
        "School Board elections generally have small turnouts.",
        "The school board may reconsider its position on certain issues if it knows the graduating class has candidates in positions, and that their classmates would turn out to vote them in.",
        "Use this to your advantage.",
        "The classmate running should be aware of needing to commit to further duties beyond just the protest issues if they do win the vote.",
        "Schedule a time to politely speak with a school authority figure.",
        "Sometimes all it takes is opening a dialogue between yourself and the other party, asking if changes can be made.",
        "You'll be surprised what can be achieved this way.",
        "Depending on who they are, they may also simply dismiss you immediately, but you will at least have asked politely before taking a more confrontational tone, not allowing your behavior to be blamed for talks going south.",
        "Don't allow yourself to be given the runaround by a principal's secretary, who may be ordered to not allow you to schedule an appointment, or will schedule appointments the principal intentionally blows off.",
        "If you're ignored, try reaching out to an even higher authority than the figure you're having problems with.",
        "If your principal is ignoring you, letting his superintendent know he isn't listening to student concerns may finally get his attention.",
        "Gather petitions to present to the school authority.",
        "On a piece of paper, state your cause for gathering signatures, and when you approach students to sign, have them print their name clearly and include a form of contact.",
        "Make photocopies, and scan it into your computer to have a database of your supporters' information.",
        "When enough signatures have been gathered, include a letter when you're submitting it, stating how many students agree with the cause you're fighting for, and asking for an appointment to discuss the petition.",
        "Authorities may try to stop your signature gathering, thinking it can lead to something bigger.",
        "Avoid bringing already filled out sheets with you when gathering new signatures.",
        "If they try to bully you to stop or to take your pages, let them know it's illegal, and you can contact your congressperson or the ACLU about this.",
        "Keep a jar or cup with you to collect any potential donations of change, which you can say you'll be using to make photocopies and prints.",
        "Holding a Protest Wear clothing with any message, so long as it's within dress code.",
        "Schools often have \u201ccontent-neutral policies\u201d referring to rules not based around the messages something gives off, but rather about an item itself, to avoid issues based around censorship.",
        "For example, a school can ban hats as part of the dress code, but if hats are permitted, they can't ban someone from wearing a hat that's pro-NRA or has something on it supporting LGBT folk.",
        "Some schools do specifically ban clothing with inappropriate material on it, such as violence, pornography, drugs, curse words, or something racist.",
        "If your school requires a uniform, consider adding a patch to it saying something in support of your cause.",
        "This way you won't be going against the dress code.",
        "Organize a walk-out rally outside the school.",
        "Since your school's funds are based on attendance, students missing class will get a huge reaction from the administration who will want to put a stop to it immediately.",
        "Have all the student supporters meet in an easily noticeable location near the school to bring as much attention to yourselves as possible from those in the school, and onlookers to your protest.",
        "Feel free to make signs in support of your cause to hold up, or make a chant of what your protest is about.",
        "Keep in mind that a walk-out can easily attract the attention of reporters and journalists.",
        "If you want to keep the media out, consider holding an \u201cindoor walk-out\u201d in the school lobby, auditorium, or gym.",
        "Stage a sit-in to force school administration to listen.",
        "If you're continuing to have a hard time getting your voice heard, have student supporters crowd into the main office of the school where the principal or superintendent's offices are.",
        "You'll be causing students to miss class, but also disrupt work at the school from being done, which will be costing it money.",
        "Refuse to leave until your demands are met, but realize this may cause them to issue out punishments to make you leave.",
        "Try to reason with the principal that giving out punishments won't get students back to class, but meeting your demands will end the protesting.",
        "However, a principal just looking to get the students out of their office may simply punish everyone involved.",
        "Contact your local state or federal congressperson to ask for support.",
        "Since public schools (and publicly-funded charter schools) are funded by the government, you are able to reach out to your local officials for their support in helping you resolve the problem.",
        "Contact their offices, and you'll be put in touch with their case worker who helps resolve problems their constituents have.",
        "A call from a government official to your school can be the deciding factor in having protestors' demands heard.",
        "Be weary when dealing with police.",
        "Police may be called in as an intimidation tactic to end a protest, or when trying to have students removed from the premises during a sit-in.",
        "The officers most likely don't want to escalate the situation and arrest anyone, and chances are you can reach a compromise with them, such as agreeing to move sit-in students from the office to the hallway.",
        "If an agreement can't be made, police may threaten or make arrests.",
        "Again, not every student protesting can be arrested, but protest leaders may be targeted to discourage others from continuing.",
        "Ask the student supporters if any of them are willing to be arrested for the protest.",
        "If many say yes, then you'll know you can pursue more aggressive protesting tactics if need be.",
        "Understand the risks and rewards of media involvement.",
        "Getting the public's attention will put increased pressure on the school to change its ways.",
        "Unfortunately, it can also make a particularly staunch principal buckle-down on their stances, and refuse to give in for the sake of looking weak.",
        "Reporters may fear getting arrested for trespassing at the school, so make sure if you invite them, it's to report on a rally set off school property.",
        "The media can also help to serve as moral support for the students, showcasing how important their protesting is in helping to bring policy change that benefits students' experiences in school.",
        "Keep student protestors' morale high.",
        "Especially in the case of longer protests, you'll want to help prevent students losing steam and wanting to give up.",
        "To keep energy sustained, try coming up with multiple chants to change between, have the protestors march around the campus, and hand out drums, noise makers, and other musical instruments to have accompany your rallying.",
        "Make a sign to have passing cars honk their horns if they support the cause of your protest, which your principal will realize is the case each time he hears a car horn.",
        "Use social media to help keep discussion of the issues going outside of school, and to schedule and invite students to new protests."
