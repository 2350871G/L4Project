    "text": " Cutting the Watermelon Trim both the ends off of the watermelon with a sharp knife. Place the watermelon onto a chopping board. Lay the melon on its side and use one hand to keep it steady. Trim 1 inch (2.5 cm) off both ends of the watermelon with a knife. Use a sharp, heavy knife. This will make it easier to penetrate the skin of the watermelon. Chop the watermelon in half. Balance the watermelon on one of the cut ends. Use one hand to keep the watermelon stable. Cut the watermelon in half lengthways using a sharp knife. Slice the halves into 1.5 in (3.8 cm) slices. Place the cut side of the watermelon down onto the chopping board. Cut the watermelon crossways into slices. Leave 1.5 in (3.8 cm) gaps between each slice. This depth of slice is ideal for grilling. Cut each slice of watermelon in half. Separate the slices of watermelon and cut each one into 2 wedges. Leave the rind on to avoid the watermelon falling apart when you flip it over. If you want smaller wedges, cut each slice into thirds. Adding the Sugar Seasoning Measure the sugar, lime zest, and pepper flakes into a bowl. Add \u00bc cup (50 g) of sugar, 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) (6 g) of lime zest, and 1/2 teaspoon (0.8 g) of red pepper flakes into a small bowl.

Mix the seasoning together using a small spoon. Stir the sugar, lime zest, and red pepper flakes together using a teaspoon. Use circular stirring motions to combine the mixture. Keep stirring until the lime zest and red pepper flakes are evenly distributed through the sugar. Sprinkle the seasoning onto both sides of the watermelon. Evenly sprinkle half the seasoning onto one side of watermelon. Press the seasoning into the watermelon so that it doesn't fall off. Turn the watermelon over and repeat the process. Grilling the Watermelon Preheat the grill to high. Turn your grill up to the high setting. If you are using a charcoal grill, allow the charcoals to heat up for 30 minutes before grilling the melon slices. Place the watermelon wedges onto the grill. Distribute the watermelon slices evenly onto the grill in a single layer. Make sure that wedges aren't touching each other. Place the melons straight onto the wire bars as this will create crunchy grill marks on the watermelon. Grill the melon for 2 minutes. After 2 minutes check that the entire watermelon has warmed through and grill marks have appeared on the bottom side. If this hasn't happened, leave the watermelon on the grill for a further 1-2 minutes. Use kitchen tongs to pick up the watermelon wedges. Turn all of the watermelon wedges over. Use kitchen tongs to turn over each watermelon slice. Try to do this as quickly as possible to make sure that all the wedges receive even cooking times. Grill the melon for 2 more minutes. Allow the watermelon wedges to grill for 2 minutes and then check to see if the bottom side has grill marks. If the flesh is still unmarked, leave the wedges on the grill for 1 more minute. Remove the watermelon from the grill and enjoy! Use kitchen tongs to transfer the grilled watermelon wedges onto a plate. Leave the melon to cool for a few minutes before eating it.
