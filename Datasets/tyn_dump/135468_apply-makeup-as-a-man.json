Concealing Dark Circles and Blemishes Test the concealer on your arm. Find the veins on the underside of your wrist. Rub a little bit of the concealer into your skin. If it matches your skin, it\u2019ll hide the veins. A concealer that matches your skin will look natural when used to hide marks on your face.

You may make them more colorful by adding silver eyeshadow to the inner corners or covering the black areas with a shiny lip gloss. You can also add mascara to make your eyes look darker. This is done by gently dragging a mascara brush over your eyelashes. Establishing a Skincare Routine Wash your face with an exfoliant. Exfoliants remove dead skin cells, which helps makeup settle better on your face. Apply some exfoliant. Don\u2019t rub it in. Instead, gently massage or pat it in. Follow up by patting your face dry with a towel. Use the exfoliant at least twice a week. You should always wash your face before applying makeup. If you have sensitive skin, use exfoliant sparingly. A non-exfoliant cleanser can always be used. It\u2019s a good idea to use once (twice for oily skin) a day even when you aren\u2019t wearing makeup. Apply toner to hydrate your skin. Toner replenishes your skin, so it\u2019s useful anytime you apply a cleanser. Get a cotton ball or cosmetic pad. Dip it in a little bit of the toner, then use it to dab the toner across your face. It\u2019ll keep your skin smooth and soft. Avoid using toners with alcohol. These can dry out your face. Protect your skin with a 15 SPF moisturizer. Moisturizer, when applied in the morning, shields your skin from the sun. It can be applied at night as well to reduce the formation of wrinkles and other marks that break up makeup. Look for a product that has an SPF rating of 15 or higher. Rub it over your face and neck. Try using moisturizer before applying makeup and after you wash it off at night. Clean off your makeup at night. Always remove makeup before you sleep. Wash your face at night to ensure you don\u2019t leave stains on your pillow. A cleanser will help guarantee that your face is free of all makeup. An oil-based cleanser is effective for removing makeup, but shouldn\u2019t be used on oily skin. Instead, stick to gels and water-based cleansers. Wear lip balm. Lip balms also protect your skin and should be applied every morning. Look for ones with at least SPF 15, since these will protect your lips from sun damage. Avoid balms that have a shiny or glossy finish. These tend to look feminine.",
