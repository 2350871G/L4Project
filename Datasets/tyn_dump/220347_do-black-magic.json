Black magic is considered a dark art because you use it to get what you want by means of controlling someone else. If your aim is to help others or bring about some form of peace and justice, look into  white magic instead. If you want to practice magic for personal gain, black magic is what you should use. Here are common reasons why people use black magic: \nTo keep someone bound in place. If someone is harming you and you wish to stop them, you can use a binding spell to stop the person's actions. To cause someone to be attracted to you. Love spells are among the most popular when it comes to black magic. To achieve immortality or improve your health. To communicate with the dead."
