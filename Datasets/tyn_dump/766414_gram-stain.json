In order for the Gram stain to be useful, add a thin layer of the sample on the stain. A sample under 24 hours old is recommended, as older bacteria may have damaged cell walls that respond less predictably to gram staining. If using a tissue sample, add 1\u20132 drops onto the glass slide. Spread it evenly on the slide to form a thin smear, using the edge of a second sterilized glass slide. Allow it to air dry before continuing. If taking bacteria from a petri dish, sterilize an inoculation loop in a Bunsen burner flame until it glows, then let it cool. Use it to place a drop of sterile water on the slide, then sterilize and cool the loop again before transferring a tiny sample of bacteria and gently stirring into the water. Bacteria in broth should be mixed in a vortexer, then added with an inoculation loop as above, without adding the extra water. If you have a swab sample, roll the swab lightly across the slide."

If using a Bunsen burner, the flame should be a small, blue cone, not a tall orange one. Alternatively, the smear may be fixed by methanol instead, by adding 1-2 drops of methanol onto the dried smear, draining off the excess methanol, and allowing it to air dry.

Crystal violet (CV) dissociates in aqueous solutions into CV+ and chloride (Cl\u2013) ions. These ions penetrate through the cell wall and cell membrane of both gram-positive and gram-negative cells. The CV+ ion interacts with negatively charged components of bacterial cells to stain the cells purple.

Iodine, in the form of negatively charged ions, interacts with CV+ to form large complexes of crystal violet and iodine (CV\u2013I complexes) within the inner and outer layers of the cell. This will trap the purple crystal violet colour in the cell, wherever it has stained. Iodine is corrosive. Avoid inhalation, ingestion, or skin contact."

Hold the slide at an angle, then add the decoloriser until no more violet colour is visible in the draining runoff. This typically takes under 10 seconds, or even less time if the decoloriser contains higher concentrations of acetone. Stop immediately, or the decoloriser will remove the crystal violet stain from both gram-positive and negative cells, and the stain will have to be repeated. Immediately rinse off excess decoloriser, using the earlier technique. Pure (95%+) acetone can be used instead. The more acetone there is, the faster the decoloriser will work, requiring more precise timing. If you are having trouble timing this step, consider adding the decoloriser drop by drop."

        "Bacteria vary greatly in size, so the total magnification required will vary from 400x to 1000x.",
        "At the higher end of these magnifications, an oil immersion objective lens is recommended for greater clarity.",
        "Place a drop of immersion oil on the slide, avoiding motion during application to prevent bubbles.",
        "Move the microscope turret so the objective lens clicks into place, touching the oil.",
        "Oil immersion can only be used on specially designed lenses, not a \"dry\" lens.",
        "Identify gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.",
        "Examine the slide under the light microscope.",
        "Gram-positive bacteria appear purple, due to the crystal violet trapped within their thick cell walls.",
        "Gram-negative bacteria appear pink or red, since the violet washed through the thin cell walls, then the pink counterstain entered them.",
        "If the sample is too thick, you may see false positive results.",
        "Stain a new sample if all bacteria types are gram-positive, to make sure the result is correct.",
        "If the decoloriser ran too long, you may see false negative results.",
        "Stain a new sample if all bacteria types are gram-negative, to double-check your results.",
        "Look up reference images.",
        "If you are not certain what a bacteria is, look through a collection of reference images, sorted by shape and result of the gram stain.",
        "You can find databases online at the National Microbial Pathogen Database, Bacteria in Photos, and many other sites.",
        "To make identification easier, common or diagnostically important examples are sorted below by gram status and shape.",
        "Identify gram-positive bacteria by shape.",
        "Bacteria are further classified by their shape under the microscope, most commonly as cocci (spherical) or rods (cylindrical).",
        "Here are a few common gram-positive (purple-stained) bacteria organized by shape:\n\nGram-positive cocci are generally either Staphylococci (meaning cocci in clusters) or Streptococci (meaning cocci in chains).",
        "Gram-positive rods include Bacillus, Clostridium, Corynebacterium, and Listeria.",
        "Actinomyces spp.",
        "rods often have branches or filaments.",
        "Identify gram-negative bacteria.",
        "Gram-negative (pink-stained) bacteria are often classified into three groups.",
        "Cocci are spherical bacteria, rods are long, thin bacteria, and coccoid rods are somewhere in between.",
        "Gram-negative cocci are most commonly Neisseria spp.",
        "Gram-negative rods include E. coli, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Serratia, Proteus, Salmonella, Shigella, Pseudomonas, and many others.",
        "Vibrio cholerae can appear as ordinary rods or curved rods.",
        "Gram-negative \"coccoid\" rods (or \"coccobacilli\") include Bordetella, Brucella, Haemophilus, and Pasteurella.",
        "Evaluate mixed results.",
        "Some bacteria are difficult to stain precisely, due to the fragility or waxiness of their cell walls.",
        "They may have a mix of purple or pink stain in the same cell, or among different cells in the same smear.",
        "Any bacteria sample over 24 hours old can have this problem, but some species are difficult to stain at any age.",
        "They may require more specialized tests to narrow down the identification, such as an acid-fast stain, culture growth observation, TSI medium cultures, or genetic testing.",
        "Actinomyces, Arthobacter, Corynebacterium, Mycobacterium, and  Propionibacterium spp.",
        "are all considered gram-positive bacteria, but often appear inconclusively stained.",
        "Small and slender bacteria such as Treponema, Chlamydia, and Rickettsia spp.",
        "are difficult to Gram-stain properly.",
        "Dispose of materials.",
        "Waste disposal procedures vary between laboratories and according to the materials being used.",
        "Typically, the liquid in the staining tray is disposed of in sealed bottles as hazardous waste.",
        "Soak slides in a 10% bleach solution, then dispose of them in sharps containers."
