Mince 4 scallions and add it to the prep bowl with the 2 cups (200 g) of cheese. You'll use the reserved cheddar cheese for sprinkling over the top of the monkey bread. Fill the dough and form small cheesy pieces. Once the dough has doubled in size, sprinkle more flour on your work surface and dump the dough onto it. Use your hands to form the dough into a 10-inch (25 cm) square. Spread the cheese and scallion mixture across half of the dough. Fold the other side of dough over the filling and use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a square. Cut the dough into 1-inch (2.5 cm) pieces. You can use a sharp knife or a bench scraper to cut the dough into even pieces. Combine the butter coating and prepare your pan.
