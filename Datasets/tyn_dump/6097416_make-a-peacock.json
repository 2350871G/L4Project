If you\u2019re crafting with kids, help them trace their own hands (or let them do it themselves), and carefully cut each hand out with a pair of scissors. Use green, blue, or purple paper to keep with the peacock-color scheme. Supervise kids closely while they use scissors, and consider getting child-safe scissors for kids under 5."

For a traditional-looking peacock, use shades of blue, green, purple, and yellow. But, if your goal is to just have fun, choose whatever colors you like the best. Use a glue stick or white craft glue on the back of each feather. Press it down on the cut-out hand, and repeat until they\u2019re all attached.
