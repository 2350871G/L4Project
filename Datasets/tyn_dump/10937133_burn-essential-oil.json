Don\u2019t use an oil that is mixed or altered with something else. Choose an organic product to minimize the possibility of contamination in your oil. Don\u2019t confuse essential oils with fragrance oils. Essential oils are extracted directly from plant materials. Fragrance oils are produced synthetically and can smell like anything, they are not produced from plants and do not have aromatherapy benefits. Essential oils are not really oils. They are highly concentrated aromatic compounds extracted from plants. This makes them unique from fragrance oils, which are created specifically to smell good. Essential oils should come in dark tinted bottles as exposure to light can degrade their chemical structures. Look for the Latin names of the plants on the bottles as this will let you know exactly what you are getting. Check the scent of the oil.

        "Fill the ceramic bowl on the top of your burner with water.",
        "Pour water slowly into the top, carefully filling the bowl until it is just below the edge.",
        "Some burners have an inner lip, which is a good indicator to use when you\u2019re filling the bowl.",
        "Using regular tap water is fine, but if you have high mineral levels in your water you may prefer to use distilled water to minimize the build-up of residue.",
        "Add 10 drops of your essential oils to the water.",
        "Using either a medicine dropper or the applicator/dispenser that came with your oil, add 10 drops of your oil to the water.",
        "If you\u2019re mixing oils, keep the total number of drops to 10 or less as you don\u2019t want to overdo it.",

        "Using an Electric Oil Burner Look for a ceramic burner that uses a low heat.",
        "A burner that uses a small lightbulb as a heating element can be a good option, as the warmer will only get as hot as the lightbulb allows.",

        "Don\u2019t burn your oils for more than an hour or so at a time.",

        "Spread this over the affected area and let it sit for 5 minutes before wiping clean with a sponge.",
        "Burning an Essential Oil Candle Buy clean-burning essential oil candles to prevent indoor air pollution.",
        "Whether you\u2019re shopping in a store or online, look for candles that are made with pure essential oils (not just fragrance).",

        "Also check for a \u201clead-free\u201d label when you purchase candles.",
        "Look for cotton wicks when you are shopping for candles.",

        "This will help speed up the melting process, diffusing oils more quickly and efficiently.",
        "Just like with oil burners, don\u2019t burn your candles all day long, every day as this can have negative health effects.",
