Wrap the twist around itself to create a bun on top of your head. Hold it secure with a soft scrunchie. Don\u2019t twist or wrap your hair tightly as you put it into a bun, otherwise, this may dent your hair and flatten your curls. This is the best hairstyle to do if you are short on time, yet want to protect your curls as much as possible. You can also do more than 1 bun if you want more voluminous curls in the morning. For example, divide your hair into 2-4 sections and create a bun for each section."
