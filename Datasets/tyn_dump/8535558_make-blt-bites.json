For the BLT bites, you\u2019ll need 1 baguette that\u2019s been sliced into 2- to 3-inch (5- to 7.5-cm) wide rounds.

They may be a little more difficult to eat, though. Place the romaine on the sandwiches. After you\u2019ve spread the mayo on half of the rounds, you\u2019ll need to layer 2 to 3 romaine leaves that have been torn into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces on the sandwiches.
