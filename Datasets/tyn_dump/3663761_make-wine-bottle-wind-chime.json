What you do with the bottom half is up to you. You can toss it into the recycling bin, or you can set it aside for another project. For example, you can turn it into a glass jar or cup. If you wish to keep the bottom half, be sure to sand and polish the cut edge. Polish the cut edge with various grits of sandpaper. Hold the sandpaper against a flat surface, like a plate, then rub the cut edge of the bottle against the sandpaper. Start with a coarse grit first, then work your way up to a medium grit, and finally to a fine grit. Keep the bottle wet as you sand it to prevent dust and chipping.
