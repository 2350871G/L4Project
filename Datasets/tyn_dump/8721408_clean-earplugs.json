Mix the water with a stirring utensil, like a spoon, or with your clean hands to distribute the soap through the water. Ear plugs that are regularly used should be washed whenever visibly dirty or every few days. Infrequently used plugs should be washed after using every time to prevent bacteria from breeding in the plugs while stored in their case. Using harsh cleaners or non-mild soaps could shorten the shelf life of your ear plugs or make them less effective. This cleaning technique can also be used for banded ear plugs. However, both banded and multi-use single-ear plugs should be replaced after 2 to 4 weeks for best performance."

Run a clean rag under warm running water. Wring the rag out over the sink to remove excess water from it. Apply a mild soap, like dish soap, to the rag. Rub the rag together to build up a light lather. Avoid getting the body of the earmuff wet. Many earmuff style noise reducers have specially designed inner parts that can be damaged or compromised if wet. Refrain from submerging the muffs in water.

This can cause your plugs to break down faster than normal. To keep your plugs in the best condition, rinse them thoroughly in non-chlorinated water after every swim. Allow plugs enough time to dry after swimming. Putting your still wet plugs straight into a case, even after a quick rinse following a swim, could cause bacteria to grow in them.
