If you use regular white paper, you can write your message and it will be invisible against the white background. You can vary this method by using any color crayon with the same color paper, e.g. black crayon and black paper. If you use other colors, make sure the crayon color and the paper color match exactly. For example, a dark orange crayon will not be completely invisible against a light orange paper. This method is just for fun and is most suitable for young children. Most adults could find this message simply by holding the paper at a different angle."
