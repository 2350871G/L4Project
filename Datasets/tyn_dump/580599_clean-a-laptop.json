Water can drip into your laptop and damage internal components, so make extra sure you've squeezed all excess liquid out. For particularly stubborn spots, add just a drop of gentle dish soap to the water.

        "You can also use a mix of equal parts rubbing alcohol and purified or distilled water.",
        "Do not use regular household cleaners for your case, or any harsh chemicals such as bleach or ammonia.",
        "If you use rubbing alcohol, take care not to get any on your laptop's screen.",
        "It can damage the anti-glare and scratch-resistant coatings on the screen.",
        "Dip a sponge into your cleansing solution.",
        "Take a clean sponge and soak it in the cleansing solution, then wring it out until it is nearly completely dry.",
        "Make sure it no longer drips, even when you squeeze it.",
        "Rub the sponge gently over the outside surface of your laptop.",
        "You can use the same sponge and cleansing solution to clean your laptop's touchpad.",
        "Don't clean inside ports or vents with the sponge \u2013 you risk getting moisture inside your laptop and damaging its components.Variation: A melamine scrub pad, such as a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser, can also be used to clean your case.",
        "Use lighter pressure with these pads, since they are mildly abrasive and may scratch the finish.",
        "These pads typically should be pre-moistened with water, but don't need any additional cleaning solutions.",
        "Use cotton swabs to clean the gunk out of crevices.",
        "If your laptop case has seams and crevices, they may collect dirt and grime.",
        "A cotton swab dipped in your cleansing solution can get into these small areas.",
        "As with the sponge, make sure the cotton swab is not too wet.",
        "Use light pressure to avoid squeezing moisture into the machine.",
        "Dig out grime with a toothpick if necessary.",
        "If narrow crevices, ports, or vents are clogged up with dirt, use a toothpick to gently scrape the case and pull the grime out.",
        "Move the toothpick in an outward sweeping motion to avoid shoving grime further up into your machine.",
        "Be gentle with the toothpick to avoid scratching the surface of your case.",
        "Hold it at an angle, like you would hold a pencil, rather than bearing down with the point.",
        "Blow debris from ports with compressed air.",
        "Angle a can of compressed air so that it is blowing into and out of the port or vent you want to clear.",
        "Turn your laptop and blow from multiple angles to make sure you've cleaned thoroughly.",
        "Never blow the compressed air directly into the port or vent.",
        "This will loosen the debris and send it deep inside your machine, where it could damage components.",
        "Use rubbing alcohol for sticky residue.",
        "If you have particularly sticky or grimy spots on your case that can't be removed with gentle cleaning, use a cotton ball dipped in rubbing alcohol directly on the spot.",
        "Make sure the cotton ball isn't too wet \u2013 you don't want rubbing alcohol running into your machine.",
        "Use moderate pressure, rubbing repeatedly until the spot is gone.",
        "If you previously had stickers on your laptop case, you may have more luck with an oil-based cleansing product, such as Goo Gone.",
