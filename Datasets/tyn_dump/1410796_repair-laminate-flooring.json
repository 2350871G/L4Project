Let the floor dry completely before you proceed. This method works for minor chips and scratches that can be repaired with putty or a marker specifically made to repair laminate flooring. For example, if you drop a knife and it leaves a small cut in the floor, you can easily repair the damage with a laminate floor repair kit. Buy a laminate floor repair kit that closely matches the color of your floor. Get laminate floor repair putty for larger chip repairs or a floor repair marker for smaller scratches.

You can mix multiple colors of putty together to get a matching color if you can't find one close enough. Disguise small scratches with a floor repair marker. Take off the cap of the marker and carefully color in the scratches. Let the marker dry for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Add more coats of the marker after it dries if the scratch is still visible. Fill in large chips using putty. Scoop out a bit of putty on a putty knife and spread it into the chipped area. Use the putty knife to smooth it out so it's level with the rest of the board, then let it dry for 1 hour. If the chip is particularly deep, then apply several thin coats of the putty until it is even with the floor. Wipe around the area with a clean, dry cloth to remove extra marker or putty. Carefully wipe around the repaired area to remove any marker or filler that got on the undamaged flooring. If you used putty, be sure to do this before it dries. Use a cleaning solvent designed for laminate flooring if you need something stronger. Replacing Damaged Boards Near the Edges Remove any baseboards, thresholds, or molding from around the area.

Replacing a Board in the Middle of the Flooring Draw a cut line in from each corner of the board and a rectangle in the middle. Mark a  1.5 in (3.8 cm) line along a straight edge with a pen or pencil in from each corner of the board diagonally towards the center. Connect the inner ends of the lines with straight lines to make a rectangle that you can cut out from the center of the board.
