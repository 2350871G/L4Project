You can harvest flowers that you want to dry at any time during the growing season, but keep in mind that when they are at their biggest and brightest, they will also smell their best. Avoid picking roses that have browning petals--they will become fully brown when they dry. Wait for the perfect time of day to pick your roses.

Rose petals with any sort of moisture on them could potentially turn brown when dried because they will begin to rot.

Be sure to cut around the entire flower. You can also pluck the petals by gently pulling each one from the base of the stems. Drying the Petals Place the petals on a drying sheet. A mesh screen such as an old window or a flat metal strainer from your kitchen will work well. Make sure that the petals are in a single layer and that none of them are overlapping.
