Doing so could knock your lamps on the floor. Some garlands come decorated with red berries and leaves to add color.

Then, take your Christmas stockings and loop their string around the paperweights to hang the stockings in place. Be careful not to add too much weight to these stockings. Since they are only held in place by paperweights, they could fall and cause other decorations to fall as well. If you want to hold your stockings in place more firmly, you could use an adhesive hook hidden behind the garland to hold them. Use stockings that are the same size and color if you want your mantel to look simple and cohesive. If your stockings do not have a string to hang from, or if the string is not long enough, attach a safety pin to the back of the stocking and tie a piece of string or twine to the pin."
