A scrap magnet is a powerful magnet you can use to sort ferrous and non-ferrous metals. A regular household magnet won\u2019t work.

If you come across any copper, place it in the container labeled \u201ccopper.\u201d Sort yellow metals into the \u201cbrass\u201d bin. Most of the yellow metals you encounter are likely brass. Don\u2019t confuse brass with gold. Gold has more of a brown color to it than brass, and it's rarer to come by. Brass is commonly found in pipe fittings, valves, bullet casings, faucets, and doorknobs. Look for aluminum in cars, boats, and building materials. Aluminum is a lightweight and silver metal. Check over aluminum with your scrap magnet to make sure there\u2019s no iron attached. If there is, remove it before you take it to the scrap yard or you won\u2019t get full price for your aluminum.
