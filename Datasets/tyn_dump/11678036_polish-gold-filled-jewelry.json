The warm water helps break down dirt and grime. If dish soap isn\u2019t quite cutting it on a very dirty piece of jewelry, try using a 1:1 mix of ammonia and water. Soak the jewelry in the water for 60 seconds before scrubbing it and rinsing it off.Tip: If you wear certain pieces of jewelry every day, give them a quick clean once a month or when you can visibly see that the gold isn\u2019t as bright as usual. For pieces worn less often, clean them several times a year as needed."
