Avoid using peanut oil, coconut oil, palm oil, tallow, and lard. These sources of oil solidify at relatively high temperatures. Biodiesel usually has a lower melting point than the oil it's made from, but these oils can still be difficult for beginners. Also avoid olive oil. It, peanut oil, palm oil, tallow, and lard all contain more acids than in the recommended neutral oils. These extra acids can interfere with the reactions that take place to create the biodiesel. It's also possible to use waste vegetable oil which has been used for cooking. However, waste oil should be filtered to remove particulates, then allowed to settle for 24 hours to separate the oil from any water or other impurities. Pure oil will be clear and bright, with no sediment."
