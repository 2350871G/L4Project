Photograph the gun to use as a guide. If you are unfamiliar with the rifle, consider documenting the assembled firearm. Use a camera or your phone to take pictures of the assembled rifle. Documenting the assembled gun will provide you with a reference source. Preparing the Rifle for Bedding Disassemble the gun and examine the previous bedding job. Take the action out of the stock. Remove the rifle\u2019s small parts. These include the magazine and trigger. Examine the existing bedding job. Note where the epoxy was placed and how the stock was bedded. If the bedding is still in good condition, you can use the same method. If the bedding is cracked, excessively worn, or softened, look into alternative bedding methods. Cover your work area with newspapers and elevate the stock with vise grips. Place newspapers on top of your flat work space. Retrieve your vise grips and set them on your work space. Insert the stock between the loosened vise grips and tighten. Vise grips will secure the stock in place and prevent the stock from rotating. If you do not have vise grips, use a gun holder instead. Degrease the action. Degreasing the action will allow other materials to adhere to the gun. Put on a pair of latex gloves. Dip a cotton ball or swab into denatured alcohol.

Placing tape over and around the recoil lug creates a small gap, which ensures the easy release of the action from the stock. Wrap the top, bottom, and sides of the recoil lug with two layers of masking tape. Cover the front and back of the recoil lug with two layers of masking tape.

Bedding the Rifle Stock Mix the bedding compound. Retrieve a non-waxed plastic cup and a popsicle stick. Use the popsicle stick to place equal parts resin and hardener into the plastic cup.

Remove excess epoxy with a cotton swab and razor blade. Once the action is screwed into the stock, epoxy seep through the seams. Wipe off any excess epoxy with a cotton swab. Go over the surface with a razor blade to scrape off any remaining residue. Curing the epoxy and Cleaning the Rifle Allow the epoxy to cure. The mixture must properly set before you can clean the stock and action. On average, you should allow the epoxy to cure for 24 to 48 hours. Always follow the curing instructions for a product. Disassemble the rifle. After allowing the compound to cure, you must take the rifle apart. Unscrew the screws from the action.
