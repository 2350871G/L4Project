Painting knives have narrow, tapered blades and a deeper bend at the \u201cneck\u201d which is designed to keep your hands out of the paint. Palette knives typically have flat, wide blades. They're useful for mixing large amounts of paint and scraping off paint palettes. Pick whichever style suits your painting goals. Palette and painting knives come in small, medium, and large sizes, with curved and pointed ends. If you're new to palette knife painting, experiment with a few different sizes and shapes to discover your favorite tool. If you're planning to create a painting with fine details, a smaller painting knife would be a good choice. But if you want to create big blocks of color, try a larger knife."

        "Use the flat base of the knife to drag color flat across the canvas.",
        "Try pushing paint at a 45-degree angle for more texture.",
        "Flick the knife upwards at the end of the gesture to create a 3-dimensional peak.",
        "Or you can twist the knife in an undulating wave gesture to create irregular textures.",
        "Point the knife in different directions to create visual movement.",
        "The most comfortable position may be holding the knife at a 45-degree angle in relation to your body.",
        "But try holding it perpendicular to your body to create vertical lines.",
        "Rotate your wrist as you apply paint to the canvas to create swirls.",
        "Try layering a series of shorter strokes on different angles to add dimension to your painting.",
        "Use a variety of directions, angles, and gestures if you're interested in creating an organic, dynamic painting.",
        "Or, repeat the same motions if you want the final result to be uniform.",
        "Creating Different Paint Effects Use the back of the blade to add smooth fields of color.",
        "A larger palette knife or painting knife will provide the most coverage, but this technique can be done using small and medium knives as well.",
        "Load up the back of the knife with paint and smooth it across the canvas.",
        "Hold the knife parallel to the canvas and touch the back of the knife to the canvas for a thinner layer of paint.",
        "Hold it slightly away from the canvas to spread on a thicker layer.",
        "This technique often results in hazy, patchy edges where you can see through to the layer of paint below.",
        "Try this anywhere you want blocks of color without much 3-dimensional texture.",
        "In a landscape painting, it might be useful for filling in the sky, for instance.",
        "Add thin lines using the narrow edge of the blade.",
        "Mix your desired color and then wipe off the knife.",
        "Turn the knife on its side and dip the thin edge of the blade into the paint.",
        "Holding the knife perpendicular the canvas and touch the edge down to create skinny lines.",
        "You can drag the knife across the canvas for a longer line or dab the edge of the knife multiple times to create a dashed line effect.",
        "For an irregular line, twitch the knife from side to side as you draw it across the canvas.",
        "This effect can be useful for painting water ripples and reflections, grasses, and trees.",
        "Apply small dots of paint using the tip and corners of the knife.",
        "After mixing your colors, wipe the knife clean and then scoop up a small amount of paint with just the tip, or one of the sharper corners.",
        "Dot or drag the paint onto the canvas, using a variety of angles and gestures to create fine details and pops of color.",
        "Scrape some paint away using the sgraffito technique.",
        "Hold the knife above the canvas at a 45-degree angle.",
        "Depending on the direction you want to move the paint, pull or push the side of the knife over the canvas to scrape away the uppermost layer of color and reveal the underlayer.",
        "Try this on wet or partially-dry paint to blend hard edges into softer atmospheric edges.",
        "Drag blotches of wet paint to dry areas using the scumbling technique.",
        "This is similar to the sgraffito technique, but instead of removing paint you'll be adding it.",
        "Keep the knife at a 45-degree angle and push wet paint onto an area of dry paint.",
        "You can use the long side of the blade to move more paint, or just the tip to create finer details.",
        "Pick up multiple colors at a time to create partially-blended strokes.",
        "Instead of completely mixing 2 or more shades together on the palette, load up the knife with a few colors and put them down onto the canvas.",
        "Use a variety of gestures and angles to spread these colors out and swirl them together.",
        "You can keep the colors mostly separate, or soften the edges with feathery strokes and gestures."
