Place the towel or blanket on the table and spread it out. You will use the towel or blanket to wrap the cat up so it can't move. You will also want to have a syringe (without a needle attached) full of water on hand if you are giving your cat a pill. This will help to wash down the pill. Keep the pill in your more dexterous hand. Get your arms at the same height as your cat."

Finally wrap the front of the towel around the cat\u2019s back snugly. This should only leave the cat's head sticking out. Make sure the material is snugly wrapped around the cat in order to keep legs and claws inside the material. Try and calm the cat if it is fighting you. Some cats will put up with being wrapped up extremely well, while others will fight you tremendously. Gauge your specific cat and judge whether you can wrap it and calm it down or if you just need to wrap it up right before you open its mouth."

You should also avoid waking your cat up to open its mouth, as it could scare the cat. Instead, just pick a time when the cat is calm and happy and wants to be around you.

Some cats will put up with being wrapped up extremely well, while others will fight you tremendously. Gauge your specific cat and judge whether you can wrap it and calm it down or if you just need to wrap it up right before you open its mouth. Making a Cat Open its Mouth Hold the cat steady on the table. If giving the cat medicine, hold the cat with your non-dominant hand while you pick up the medication with your dominant hand. If you have a helper, have them hold the wrapped cat for you. If you don\u2019t, slide your elbow and forearm of your non-dominant hand alongside the cat\u2019s wrapped body until you are holding it between your arm and your chest while the wrapped cat is still on the table. Position your fingers. Put your thumb on one side and your forefinger on the other side of your cat's mouth along the cheeks where the jaw hinges. You will be able to just barely be able to feel the teeth through the cheeks. Apply pressure gently until your cat opens its mouth by pressing down on the cat\u2019s lower jaw until it opens its mouth. Basically you are pushing your fingers between the upper and lower jaw while applying downward pressure. This pressure will be uncomfortable for the cat so it will open its mouth. Giving a Cat Medication in its Mouth Insert any medicine into your cat's mouth while you have the mouth open. Using your pointer finger and thumb, put the pill toward the back of the mouth over the tongue in one quick movement. Then quickly withdraw your fingers so you don\u2019t get bit. If you are worried about getting bit, you can purchase a pill popper that is like a long syringe with a plunger that you place the pill in and pass this into the cat\u2019s mouth.
