        "Depending on which brand you are using, it will take about two hours for it to dry.",
        "You do not need to drag a foam brush through the sealer; simply apply the sealer with a clean foam brush.",
        "Replace the handles and plaques, and remove the painter's tape.",
        "For a nicer touch, coat the handles with spray paint before attaching them.",
