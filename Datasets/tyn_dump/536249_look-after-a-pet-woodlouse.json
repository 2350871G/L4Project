For lots of woodlice, consider purchasing a container, such as a plastic terrarium or glass aquarium from your local pet store. Keep in mind that if you pick a shoe box or small cardboard box, you won't be able to keep the woodlice for more than a day. This is because the moist material and environment will make the container break down quickly."
