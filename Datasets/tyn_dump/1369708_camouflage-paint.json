If you don\u2019t need the camouflage to blend into your surroundings, you can choose any color scheme you want, such as 4-5 shades of pinks or blues. Colors to Use Based on Your Surroundings\nIf you want to blend into the forest, use various shades of green and brown. For desert camouflage, pick tans, dark browns, and pale reds. If you\u2019re using camouflage in a snowy environment, use whites, light blues, and greys. For urban camouflage, use a variety of greys."
