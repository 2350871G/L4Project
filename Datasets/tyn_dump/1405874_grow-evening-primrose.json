It can survive in partial shade, but it really needs quite a lot of direct sunlight if you want to get the most out of the blooming flowers. Evening primrose will not survive in a completely shaded area, so be sure there is some direct sunlight in the planting location you choose.

As primarily annual plants that bloom from spring to fall, evening primrose does not tolerate cold weather very well. Plant the seeds in an equal mixture of soil, peat moss, and sand. You can plant the seeds indoors initially to help the seedlings get a jump start. If so, plant them ten weeks before the first frost-free date in your area.

A spritz of water once every couple of days should be good, but feel free to provide additional water if the soil seems dry. However, don't over-water them -- the soil should be moist, not muddy. Once the plants are well-established, they are quite hardly and require little maintenance (other than pruning). They can withstand hot, arid temperatures and semi-drought conditions.
