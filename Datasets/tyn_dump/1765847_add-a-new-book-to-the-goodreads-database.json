Supply the type of author for the book with the box that is displayed after clicking the \"Add role\" link next to the author's name box. Although you can choose between many different types of author-roles in the author role drop-down, there is a fill-in box that can be accessed if the author role isn't supplied. If more than one author exists, there's a link just below this box, that asks you for these additional authors. Supply as many as is given in the order they appear on the front cover of the book, after clicking the \"Add author\" link as many times as you need to enter all of them into the appropriate boxes. Author-ize books such as the Bible (any type of Bible) or traditional stories under no name or a book with the only official author name of \"Anonymous\" as Anonymous in the author field. If there's any uncertainty in the author name and a suitable author can't be found anywhere in the book or on the Internet (through reputable sources), list the author as \"Unknown\". Upload the picture of the front cover of the book into the box just below the \"Add a cover image for this book.\" field. Although it's okay to use your own image of that exact book from a file you have on hand, it is also acceptable to use the Amazon book picture (as long as the picture isn't just Goodreads or Amazon stock photos (stock photos on Goodreads look like a brown-covered book with just the plain text of the title and author of the book, as for Amazon, these generic cover art may vary a little more widely depending on the situation) or as long as the photo isn't a book with the same title but as another edition-again, it's best to research the item on Amazon under its ASIN or ISBN before searching with the title. Type in the ISBN or ASIN (Amazon-only direct access ID-type) codes. From one Librarian to the rest of the reading community here on wikiHow, Goodreads wants regular paperback or hardcover books to be listed under the ISBN or ISBN-13 number and use only the ASIN numbers for Kindle and Audible books. Use ISBN numbers for anything else, but you can still research the book on Amazon for information using the items ASIN number.. Click the \"Click for ASIN\" link to switch this box type to ASIN-mode. Type the publisher name and publication dates (year, month, day - text, drop-down, text) for the book into the applicable fields. (While the publisher name can be found inside the book on the publisher data or title page or on Amazon itself according to an ISBN number search in the search bar, it is best to use the publication date of the book according to the date Amazon will give to you as the Publication date line will list) However, be careful that you are punctuating and capitalizing the publisher name as it appears there.If there is no data given and the data can't be retrieved from WorldCat, you can take the copyright year, leaving the remainder of the data unlisted for the other portions of the publication year: however, keep that information as a \"case of last resort\".. Type the number of pages the book contains into the \"number of pages\" box. As per Goodreads policies, they consider the amount of pages in the book to include all pages in the book, except for advertisements for other books or preview chapters. You can also grab this information from Amazon for this specific edition unique identifier. Other types of books will get special treatment and will vary greatly..\nFor books that are digital read-outs (or have been narrated, and may include Audiobook, Audio CD, Audio Cassette, Audible Audio, CD-ROM and MP3 CD listings), take the information you obtain for the ISBN and round the hour amount up to the next hour and list that hour reference as the number of pages. Don't try to estimate the pages of the real book to put into audiobook form. Even if the audiobook is only a minute or two long, round it up to the next hour. (e.g. If the listing says the book lasts 3 minutes, the page count should read 1 since the next total amount of hours past the 3 minutes is 1 hour.) Click the drop-down menu for the type of format the book is (which you currently own in your hands). Most often, these entries will be \"Hardcover\", \"Paperback\", \"Kindle book\" (as opposed to \"eBook\" when bought from the Kindle for Amazon store or bought as its own Kindle book or \"Audio CD\" or even \"Audible Audio\", but there are many more format types available in this list. Be careful of books of the types of eBooks out there. If it is bought directly from a company selling eBooks (Amazon, Barnes and Noble), these should not be listed as \"ebook\" when these formats are on the list already. There are others that have similar conventions as to format types, but aren't commonly recognized or commonly used, but must be applied. If the book isn't sold from a first-rate retailer (Amazon, Barnes and Noble), you must select \"eBook\" from the list. If you can't determine the format, you must select \"Unknown Binding\". Be careful not to select \"Unbound\" as these look similar from the get-go but mean two completely different things. Other commonly mismarked format differences include \"Paperback\" with \"Mass Market Paperback\", \"Library Binding\" with \"Hardcover\", \"CD-ROM or MP3-CD with Audio CD\" and must be watched accordingly. If this type of format isn't available, click the \"Other\" link and type the format into the text-entry box. Type the edition number, if the book has more than one edition number or is a special-entry edition information item. This field is for special entry information only (holiday edition, 2nd edition, etc.). This should be entered in the field as it is written on or inside the cover. Type in the \"official url\" to the book if there is one available. This field is optional and should be used if there is an author or publisher site that describes the book you have. It should never list a fan site, library or other site about the book. Copy the book's description from the Amazon-specific unique description of the book, or enter the words from the very back of the book in the order they appear on the back of the book (unless the back of the book has book critics reviews which you can omit from the Description box. This Description box is critical should the addition other editions pop-up, as these carry-over without even asking the edition adder from one edition to the next. If there is no data on this page as for this description, you can copy the data off the back cover or dust jacket to the book word-for-word, . Although this rarely happens, if you still have no data for this box, you can write your own summary for the description, without writing a spoiler inside the box and without using images or links to external sites. You can grab data in certain circumstances as to describe books from Wikipedia, but the exact link to this site must be written inside the description box to explain where this data originated from. Scroll your eyes and the page down slightly, and select from the drop-down menu underneath the description, the language the book is written in. Although the default selection at the top of the list is English (as English is the most-commonly used language for book entries on Goodreads), this language will depend on what language the book is written in. (i.e. If the book is a translated book (of an English book) into Portuguese, this entry must be selected as \"Portuguese\" since this is the language of the book. Look below the \"Work Settings\" label to find three fields (for non-Librarians) to fill in. Although optional, sending this information out will help those looking to find a book with alternate information, or which has been republished with drastically different information. Type in the original title and original publication dates using the same formatting as the title and publication dates field formatting above, if the data differs widely from the very first publication to the present-day one. Most oftentimes, the original publication date will be the earliest copyright date mentioned on the book's title/publication data page just a few page-turns inside the book. Watch out for the \"media type\" field. Although it can be your \"best friend\" when the media is something other than a book, it can also be your worst enemy if you accidentally select \"not a book\". For information on what isn't a book or is something other than those books most commonly used, utilize the information presented here. The not a book option will now display for every account that is created, though it is only supposed to show for Goodreads Librarians. Look out for the reCaptcha image. Although users who are long-time users are grandfathered in to not having to fill this field out, those who aren't will need to fill out this box. The reCaptcha box, once checked, will verify that you aren't a robot that is sending new books through the database, each and every time you fill out this form. Scroll back down to the end again (or tap the \u21f2 End button on your keyboard) and click the \"Create book\" button.  New Alternate Edition Search for the profile page of the book, and make this book display. At the very least, search by the ISBN or ASIN number. Then try searching by complete title, but this type isn't very good. Not only will searching help narrow the search down to books with the same name, it'll also narrow the search down to duplicate editions of existing editions of the same book you might be wanting to add. Click the most accurate match to another version of the book (according to title), if it still doesn't display. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/af\\/Add-a-New-Book-to-the-Goodreads-Database-Method-2-Step-1.png\\/457px-Add-a-New-Book-to-the-Goodreads-Database-Method-2-Step-1.png\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/af\\/Add-a-New-Book-to-the-Goodreads-Database-Method-2-Step-1.png\\/759px-Add-a-New-Book-to-the-Goodreads-Database-Method-2-Step-1.png\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":64,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":106.48351648351648,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Fair_use\\\">Fair Use<\\/a> (screenshot)<br>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\nIf a relative search result displays in the search bar in real-time (especially with an ASIN/ISBN search), this yields the possibility that you'll need to add another edition if the two items aren't the same. If you searched by the title and came up with a relative title, it's time to create an alternate edition with the title given - if not, it's time to create a new book entirely. Click on the \"Add New Edition\" link that is found underneath the section containing images of other editions of the book that are other editions of the book in the database. If there are no other editions of the book, you'll find this link towards the top of the listing above the \"Get a copy\" section that contains some critical other places to purchase the book that is always displayed. Verify the pre-filled text of the Add a New Edition page is displayed. With the New Edition page, the form will prefill several items including the title, sort-by title, author, and description - most of which you can just do a \"once-over\". The rest you'll have to type in manually. Recognize the need to add what Goodreads calls an \"alternate cover edition\" when the ISBN comes up but the cover is different (those that don't have a cover but can be obtained legally for Goodreads' use is different and only a Goodreads Librarian can help and should never be re-added). Try adding in the ISBN-10 or ISBN-13 numbers into the appropriate fields, or switch the ISBN numbers into ASIN entry (for Kindle or Audible books) by clicking the \"Click for ASIN\" and typing the data into the appropriate field according to what is displayed in the book's details. Goodreads Librarians recognize how annoying it is when adding one and the ISBN sends back an error. However, if you aren't a Goodreads Librarian, you'll want to hold off on clicking the \"Create book\" until all fields are filled out to their entirety. Acknowledging where the error lays if you get the error message yourself is a big help, and can be remedied through an action that you can also take. Enter all other data into the form, including the cover image of the book, utilizing the same form data as you would have entered had you been entering a new book itself. Use the same conventional formats as those used in the above method (adding a brand new book to the database). These same conventions apply to adding alternate editions too. Click on the \"Create book\" button at the bottom of the form of data you've just entered. ",
