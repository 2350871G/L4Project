The attachment should be designed for your specific type of grill. Typically, the rotisserie attachment is an electric motor that rests on a bracket outside of the grill. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions to secure it in place. The rotisserie attachment needs to be secure in the bracket or else your meat will fall right off into the fire. If your grill comes with a rotisserie attachment, it will be beside the grill\u2019s hood. If your grill doesn\u2019t have this, you can purchase a motor online or at most retails stores that sell grills. Cooking rotisserie-style without a motor is possible. You will need to build a fire pit or campfire. Then, skewer the meat with rotisserie forks before setting it over the fire."

        "The motor will have an open hole for you to slide 1 of the forks into.",
        "Brace the second fork with your other hand as you fit the spit onto the motor.",
        "The grill itself will have rings or slots that hold the forks in place, so slide them into position.",
        "Turn on the motor to make sure the meat turns freely.",
        "The way the spit attaches depends on your grill.",
        "A lot of grills have slots for the spit on their hoods.",
        "Other grills have slots on the grill itself.",
        "If you wish to use a rotisserie without a motor, you will need to spin the skewers at a slow, even pace by hand.",
        "When you get tired, have a friend take over.",
        "Add extra ingredients to the drip pan if you wish to add more flavor.",
        "Many grillmasters choose to put about 1 cup (240 mL) of water in the pan.",
        "They also add ingredients like onions, peppers, and herbs to cook as the meat roasts.",
        "Any ingredients you add won\u2019t add much flavor to the meat itself, but you can pour them onto the meat later.",
        "You don\u2019t need to add anything more than hot water to the pan if you don\u2019t want to.",
        "The water will catch the drippings and prevent them from flaring up in the pan.",
        "You can add wine, beer, or juice to the pan in place of water, if you wish.",
        "Close the grill\u2019s lid and cook the meat for about 1 \u00bd hours.",
        "The cooking time depends on the weight of the meat and your heat setting.",
        "Expect any piece of meat to take between 15 to 20 minutes per 1 lb (0.45 kg).",
        "Heavier birds and roasts can take 2 hours or longer, so determine how much time the meat needs to reach the proper temperature.",
        "If you cook multiple pieces of meat at the same time, use the weight to determine how much cooking time each piece needs.",
        "Cooking times may vary.",
        "The meat\u2019s weight, the grill\u2019s heat setting, and how the coals or burners are arranged affect the time estimate.",
        "You can cook rotisserie-style with an open grill, but it may take longer.",
        "If your grill has a rotisserie burner, you may want to turn it off after 10 or 15 minutes to prevent the meat from drying out.",
        "Test the meat 30 minutes before it's done cooking.",
        "Stick a meat thermometer into the center of the meat.",
        "If the meat isn't finished cooking, test it again every 15 minutes until it is done.",
        "This way, you don't have to see your hard work dry out.",
        "The meat should be crispy and brown but tender when it is finished.",
        "The temperature depends on what you are cooking.",
        "For a pork roast, it should be around 160 \u00b0F (71 \u00b0C).",
        "A chicken breast should be around 180 \u00b0F (82 \u00b0C).",
        "The meat will continue to cook after it is removed from the heat, so take it out right before it reaches the final temperature.",
        "If the meat isn\u2019t done, continue cooking it.",
        "Test it again every 15 minutes to prevent if from overcooking.",
        "Let the meat rest for 15 minutes before cutting it.",
        "Move the meat to a cutting board after it is done cooking.",
        "Resist the temptation to sink your teeth in right away.",
        "When the meat has had plenty of time to rest, remove the twine and serve it.",
        "Serve the meat with anything in the drip pan.",
        "Store the leftovers for up to 4 days in the refrigerator.",
        "Slice up any leftovers and store them resealable plastic containers.",
        "You can also wrap up the meat in foil or plastic wrap if you don\u2019t want to cut it right away.",
        "Remember to store the meat within 2 hours of cooking it to avoid bacterial growth.",
        "The meat can also be frozen for up to 4 months in the freezer.",
        "If it is stored longer than that, it will still be safe to eat but may not have much taste to it."
