Recommendations for carry weight is 10% of your total weight.If your school allows it, it's a good idea to have a medium sized book bag or tote to carry around class to class also, though some schools don't allow any bags, many will say no backpacks but totes or book bags are fine.

        "Then try to put that time for homework in your weekly schedule.",
        "With the right schedule, you will become the responsible person that you should be!",
        "[[Image:Be Organized in Middle School Step 4.jpg|center]] Always have backup supplies!",
        "You want to have backup supplies just in case you lose any of it, or you forget it somewhere.",
        "Make sure to have a couple of extra packs of paper and pens/pencils in your locker.",
        "At home, set up a drawer or area in your room for extra school supplies.",
        "This really helps as you know where everything you're not using is.",
        "It is also a good idea if you plan to buy bulk packs of things, which is very cheap, but can be hard to keep track of.",
        "If you have a \"School Supply Drawer\", you will always have a place to put extras, and know where those things are when you eventually need them.",
        "Only buy the types of supplies you need.",
        "If you are in 8th grade, you probably won't need to buy lots of glue sticks and crayons, while a 5th grader won't need a graphing calculator.",
        "If you only buy what's on your supply list, and anything else you KNOW that you will use, you'll have a lot less junk to keep track of.",
        "Label everything, and label it correctly, so you know where everything is.",
        "Labeling your notebooks and folders makes them easier to find.",
        "If you can make the folder and notebook for a class the same color, that helps too.",
        "If you like to draw or make up stories in your free time or while waiting for the bus, keep an \"extra folder\" for all your papers.",
        "If you have teachers that often give you big assignments, keep a spot in your notebook for keeping up with all the info and supplies for that project so it won't be mixed in with daily work.",
        "Keep hole punch that goes in your binder so any papers your teacher hands you, you can put them in your binder (if you keep a binder).",
        "Do not shove all papers into your backpack; this will make a mess and you will not be able to find anything you need!",
        "All of your papers will also get crumpled and ripped, and you don't want to hand them in like that!",
        "Make sure to pay attention.",
        "If you do not pay attention and one of your teachers calls on you, how will you know the right answer?",
        "You could use your study guide if you have one and know where it is.",
        "If your school has lockers, consider buying a locker organizer.",
        "Otherwise, do your best to divide it into several sections.",
        "Example: One for textbooks, one for notebooks, one for binders, and another for a backpack.",
        "Keep a magnetic pencil holder and a whiteboard on your locker door.",
        "The magnetic pencil holder is for spare pens, pencils, highlighters, erasers, and supplies.",
        "The whiteboard is where you will write your assignments, classes, and memos on.",
