This is generally executed with a jump to increase the intensity of the hit, which can increase the difficulty of the other team being able to return the ball. Scoring in Beach Volleyball Play three games to win a match. There are three games in every match. A team must win two of those games in order to win the match. The first team to reach 21 points wins the game but they must be leading by at least two points. The third game is only played to 15 points and must also be won by a two point advantage. Use a rally point system for scoring. When the play stops at the end of each rally, a point is earned. A rally is the number of hits between the two teams.
