Before trying this, understand that it requires you to lie to your doctor about your comfort or vision. Lying to your doctor is not a good idea for a number of reasons, one being that it creates conflicting data that makes it harder to be fit properly with lenses. Your optometrist will likely be happy to give you some free contacts to try and find the perfect fit for you, and after that you should accept that you need to pay for them. If they are too expensive, ask your doctor about coupons, less expensive brands, or stick to glasses. If you do decide to go this route, however, here are a few reasons you may need to test out new contact lenses:\nYou can tell your optometrist that your last trial pair did not fit properly and bothered your eyes. You could say that your current contacts are prone to rips and tears and you want to find a more durable lens. You are interested in testing out prescription color contact lenses to freshen up your look and want a trial pair. You find the daily contact lenses you currently use a bit of a hassle and would like to test out the two week lenses (or vice versa)."
