    "text": " Stretching and Warming Up Warm up your muscles by jogging, jumping rope or doing jumping jacks. Get your blood flowing and your muscles warm to start stretching out. Lay out a mat, or find some soft ground. Use a yoga or gymnastics mat or a mattress, or clear an area on a soft carpet or rug. Make sure your area is clear of any tripping hazards. Stretch your ankles. Flex your foot as far back as you can, so the toes are pointing up in the air. Then point your foot down, so the toes are parallel to the floor or, if you\u2019re more flexible, angled slightly towards it. Repeat 10-20 times, then switch feet. Roll out your ankles by sitting and holding an ankle in one hand. Roll your foot in circles several times, then switch feet. Do a wrist extensor stretch. Extend your arm with your palm facing upwards and elbow straight. Pull your hand down with your other hand. Hold for ten seconds, then repeat with your other wrist. Your wrists will be bending and bearing a lot of your weight in a backbend, so make sure you stretch them well. Do a wrist flexor stretch. Extend one wrist in front of you with your palm facing away and your fingertips up. Pull your fingers back with your other hand until you feel a nice stretch. Hold for ten seconds and repeat with the other hand. Do a cat cow pose. This simple yoga pose will open up your chest and back and get you ready for more intense stretches. Start on your hands and knees with your wrists directly below your shoulders. Inhale and drop your belly towards the mat, arching your spine. Exhale and draw your belly into your spine, rounding your back. Repeat 10-15 times. Try some deeper yoga poses. Get into cobra position by lying with your belly on the floor, placing your hands under your armpits and pushing up, arching your spine and stretching your chest. Try a camel pose by kneeling, placing your hands on your lower back and arching your spine back. If you\u2019re more flexible, give the bow pose a try. Doing a Bridge Lie on your back and bend your legs up. Place your feet close together on the floor and bend your legs so that your knees are sticking straight up off the ground. Place your hands by your head. Your fingertips should be pointing towards your shoulders and your palms pushed flat against the floor with your elbows pointing up in the air. Push through your shoulders and lift your body. Straighten your arms as much as you can. Focus on keeping your core, legs and butt muscles tight. It\u2019s okay if you can\u2019t lift far off the ground yet, or if you need to keep your arms bent. Practice your bridges a couple times a day and you\u2019ll feel yourself grow stronger. Lift only your hips off the ground if you can\u2019t push all the way up. From your position laying on the floor, place your arms down at your sides. Squeeze your butt and core to lift your hips off the ground. Hold the pose for a few seconds, then lower yourself down. Bend your arms and slowly lower your body until you\u2019re lying flat on the ground. Give yourself a short rest, then repeat 2-3 more times. Practicing a Backbend Against a Wall Take one to two steps away from a blank wall. Place your feet about shoulder-width apart from each other. Place your palms against your buttocks and push your hips forward. Lift and elongate your spine and rib cage. This will allow your spine to stretch out and arch more cleanly. Stretch your arms straight up above your head and tilt your head back. Reach back far enough with your neck and back so that you can look at the wall. Bend your back and place your palms against the wall. Keep your elbows straight, your head tipped back and your neck long. Press your hands against the wall. Remember to keep breathing! Walk down as far as you can. Continue to keep your elbows straight and breathe evenly. Walk your arms back up the wall and straighten from your hips. Inhale as you come back to standing. Take your time and lift your head slowly. Fall forward gently and touch your toes to stretch out. Exhale and bend smoothly from your hips, allowing your back to relax. Take a couple of deep breaths.
