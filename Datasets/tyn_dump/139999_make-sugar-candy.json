Red rock candy with cinnamon flavoring. Suspend the wooden skewers in the solution. Place them evenly around the jar and lean them against the lip of the jar. Secure them in place with small pieces of tape, so they don't slide against each other while the rock candy forms. You can use wooden chopsticks in place of skewers. A string suspended from a pencil is also a good base for rock candy. Cover the jar with plastic wrap. This prevents dust and bugs from getting into the jar while the rock crystals form. Wait for the sugar to form into rocks. It takes a week or two for the sugar to crystallize into the shape of pretty rocks attached to the skewers. Dry the rock candy. When you're happy with the size of the rocks, remove the skewers from the jar and lay them out to dry. Making Butterscotch Candy Butter a 15 x 10 x 1 pan.
