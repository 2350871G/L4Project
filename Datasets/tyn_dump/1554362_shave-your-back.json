You may not have full visibility of the region that you're shaving, and you may not be able to tell easily when you've missed a spot. Consider finding someone else to do it: probably a partner or a paid professional. Use the safest razor possible. Choose a razor with a lot of blades, and ideally a razor with built-in safety features. A quality electric razor may be better for your back than a cheap manual razor. Keep a towel on hand in case you cut yourself. If you slice your back while shaving, it probably won't bleed too profusely \u2013 but it will be painful. Use the towel to blot the blood in the case of a mishap."
