        "Make sure your lines are perfectly square with a straight edge so you can lay the tiles along the line.",
        "Peel the protective backing off of 1 tile.",
        "Flip your first tile over so the bottom faces up.",
        "Use your fingernail to peel the plastic backing off one of the tile's corners.",
        "Pull the backing off slowly so you don\u2019t touch any of the adhesive, or else it may not stick as well later on.",
        "Hold onto the edges and non-adhesive side of the tile to move it.",
        "Throw away the backing as soon as you remove it so your room doesn\u2019t get messy while you\u2019re working.",
        "Don\u2019t remove the backing until you\u2019re ready to install the tile since it can be challenging to move later on.",

        "Flip the tile over so the adhesive side faces down toward the floor.",
        "Line up a corner of the tile with one of the 4 corners made from the chalk lines in the center of the room.",
        "Make sure the sides line up perfectly with the chalk, or else the rest of your tiles may look crooked as well.",
        "Slowly lower the tile to the floor before pressing on it with the base of your palm.",
        "Peel and stick tiles are difficult to remove cleanly once you place them, so make sure the tile lines up before you set it down.",
        "Lay additional tiles in the same quadrant, working toward the walls.",
        "Only work in 1 quadrant of your room at a time so it\u2019s easier to set the tiles without walking over them.",
        "Place the next tile so the edges form a straight line with the first tile you put down.",
        "Ensure the tiles line up with the ones next to them before you remove the backing, or else they\u2019ll look crooked.",
        "Continue adding tiles 1 at a time to make sure they form a clean surface across the entire floor.",
        "Complete 1 row at a time before moving onto the next row in the same quadrant.",
        "If you plan on putting grout between your tiles, put tile spacers between each of the tiles so the grout can fill in between them.Tip: If the tiles have arrows on the bottom, make sure they all point in the same direction or else the pattern won\u2019t look consistent.",
        "Cut tiles with a straight edge and utility knife if they don\u2019t fit.",
        "Measure the size of the gap between the last full tile on your floor and the wall so you can find out what size you need.",

        "Trace the piece of paper on your tiles so you know where to make your cuts.",
        "If you need to cut a tile to fit around a curved surface, make a stencil of the shape with paper.",

        "Repeat the process for the remaining quadrants.",
        "Once you've finished a section, move onto the next.",
        "Use the same procedure so you start from the center marking and work your way across in rows.",
        "It's best to start on the far side of the room and work toward the exit.",
        "Finishing Your Tile Floor Go over the tiles with a roller to help them adhere better.",
        "A vinyl roller has a weighted end and ensures the entire tile presses against your floor.",
        "Start the roller in 1 corner of your room and pull the roller slowly over all of the tiles.",
        "Overlap areas you\u2019ve already rolled by about 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) to ensure you get even coverage.",
        "Continue rolling across all of your tiles so they\u2019re less likely to lift up as they age.",
        "Ask hardware or flooring specialty stores if they can rent you a vinyl roller so you don\u2019t have to buy one.Tip: If you aren\u2019t able to get a vinyl roller, you can also use a standard rolling pin.",
        "Apply firm pressure as you roll over each of your tiles.",
        "Apply grout if you\u2019re using groutable peel and stick tiles.",
        "Grout helps fill in spaces between tiles and prevents dirt from getting stuck on your floors.",
        "Mix the grout in its container so you can spread it around easily, and transfer some onto your floor with a grout sponge.",
        "Press the grout into the spaces between your tiles with the sponge until it\u2019s flush with the tops of the tiles.",
        "Leave the grout to dry for at least 24 hours so it has time to set.",
        "Don\u2019t apply grout if you didn\u2019t use groutable peel and stick tiles since they will be too thin otherwise.",
        "Be sure to wipe any excess grout away with clean water so your tiles don\u2019t try with a hazy finish.",
        "Wait 5 days before cleaning or washing your floor.",
        "Your new tiles will take some time to fully set and waterproof your floors, so avoid doing any heavy cleaning.",
        "Don\u2019t use a mop or water on the floor since moisture could still get caught underneath the tiles.",
        "After 5 days, you can clean as you normally would.",
        "It\u2019s okay to sweep or vacuum if you need to.",
        "Try to avoid using the room with new tiles as much as you can so you don\u2019t feel the need to clean it.",
        "Reinstall the baseboards in your room.",
        "Line up the old baseboards with their positions on the walls and press them in firmly.",
