Using a sharp knife, cut the lemon halfway down the middle, so that when you open it the inside looks like a pie cut into slices. To protect your countertop, place a cutting board down beneath your lemon before you slice it. Some people prefer to slice their lemon lengthwise, or pointed end to pointed end, when juicing it by hand. You can do this instead if you prefer."

If you turn the lemon with the cut facing down, the seeds will run out when you squeeze into your bowl. Holding the cut facing up allows most of the seeds to stay inside the lemon instead of getting into your bowl. A few seeds may fall down into your bowl even if you hold the lemon with the cut facing up. Just remove the seeds from your bowl with your fingers or a spoon when you\u2019re finished juicing."
