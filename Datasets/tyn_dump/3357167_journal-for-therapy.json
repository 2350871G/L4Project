The important thing is that you choose a journal medium which inspires you to write. If no medium leaps out at you as the right choice, try journaling in various ways until something sticks. Use an analog notebook if you prefer to set your thoughts down with a pen or pencil. Jot down your thoughts in an old spiral notebook, if that captures your fancy, or buy a leather-bound journal so that you can start fresh. Use a small notebook for portability, or a large notebook to conceptualize big ideas. Make sure to choose a pen that feels good in your hand. Keep a journal on your computer or your phone, if you prefer to type. Use a standard word processor (like Word or Notepad) or anything other program that feels right. Save all of your journal entries into one document, or save each entry into a new document within a \"Journal\" folder. It may be most convenient for you to journal on your computer if you also work from your computer. If you like the idea of making your thoughts more public, consider keeping an online journal. Build a simple page on a free blog site like WordPress or LiveJournal. Post regular journal entries. You don't need to share the link with anyone, or try to amass a following \u2013 the very act of posting online may help you keep yourself accountable. Consider keeping an audio journal. If you are more comfortable speaking than writing, consider recording your thoughts to the voice recorder app on your smartphone or computer. Sit down with the recorder and talk through your thoughts for a few minutes \u2013 you may find that you process emotions better through talking."

Journal just before breakfast, on the train to work, or at night before you drift off to sleep. Find a time at which your thoughts are clear.
