Repairing Damaged Roll Roofing Look for cracks or blisters in the roofing material. As you would with a shingle roof, check for damage on the exterior that corresponds with the water stains you\u2019ve seen on the ceiling. Look closely for small cracks around joints, vents, chimneys, or other objects that come through the roof. More obvious signs of leaks include open splits in the roofing material and blisters or bubbles where water and air have collected. You can mend a small gap at a joint, vent, or chimney with roofing sealant. Any gaps wider than \u20444 in (0.64 cm), open splits, or blistered areas will need to be patched. Like shingle repairs, mending minor damage to asphalt or rubber roll roofing is relatively easy. However, if you notice widespread wear, water stains, mold, or rot on the roof or ceiling, call a professional. Cut any blisters or bubbles to release air and water. Sweep away any gravel from the damaged area, then carefully slice through the middle of the blister with a utility knife. Cut only through the blister at the top layer of roofing; do not cut the roof substrate, or the fiberboard beneath the rubber or asphalt. If the blister contained water, soak it up with a dry rag. After thoroughly mopping up water, allow it to dry for 12 to 24 hours. If you\u2019re in a rush, dry it out with a blow dryer; just be sure it\u2019s completely dry before you attempt repairs. Blisters often occur with leaks in roll roofing. If there's no blister associated with your leak, skip this step and proceed to mending the tear. Spread a generous amount of roofing cement under the split. Inspect the fiberboard substrate beneath the tear in the rubber or asphalt. If the substrate is sound, use a small trowel to apply a heavy layer of cement under the edges of the tear. Push the cement as far under the edges as you can without further tearing the roofing material. After cementing the edges of the tear, press it down flat, then drive galvanized roofing nails along each side of mend in 3 in (7.6 cm) intervals. If the fiberboard substrate is unsound, you\u2019ll need to replace the damaged section. Replace the roofing substrate, if necessary. If you\u2019re dealing with a large, open seam, check the roof substrate beneath the rubber or asphalt for rot or holes. If it\u2019s failing, use a straightedge and sharp utility knife to remove the damaged area. Carefully cut a rectangle-shaped section that contains all of the damaged roofing material. Check for and remove any metal washers and screws that secure the roof substrate to the structure beneath it.

Set the new substrate into place, then secure it with 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm) roofing screws with built-in hex washers. Cover the repaired area with a patch of roll roofing. If you didn\u2019t need to replace the roof substrate, cut a patch of tar paper or rubber roll roofing 12 in (30 cm) wider and longer than the mended section. Apply a generous layer of roof cement over the repaired tear, then set the patch over the cement-covered area. Press it lightly, and drive 1 \u20444 in (3.2 cm) galvanized roofing nails around the patch\u2019s edges in 3 in (7.6 cm) intervals.

Replacing Damaged Wood Shakes Inspect your roof for signs of damage. If you haven\u2019t already tracked down the leak, follow the same steps as you would for any other roofing material.

Carefully position the chisel into the damaged shake, then strike the chisel with a hammer. Use a steady, controlled motion to avoid damaging adjacent shakes. After splitting the damaged shake, remove the pieces with a set of pliers. Use a hacksaw to cut off the nails that secured the broken shake. Peer into the spot where the broken shingle sat, and locate the nails that secured it. Slide the hacksaw blade beneath the shingle above the one you\u2019ve removed. Saw through the old nails where they protrude from the roof board to make room for the new shingle. Be careful when using a hacksaw or any other sharp tools. If you\u2019re not confident in your ability to wield saws, hammers, or other tools on a pitched surface, call in a professional. Cut a new shake to fit into the gap.

Hammer 2 galvanized wood shingle nails into the new shake at an upward angle just below the edge of the shake above it. Next, place a wood block against the new shake, and strike the block with a hammer to tap the shake into place. As the shake slides the last 1 in (2.5 cm) into place, it\u2019ll pull the nail heads beneath the shake above it. If you\u2019re unable to use this technique to secure the nails inconspicuously, just drive the nails in directly below the shake above the replacement. Seal any exposed nail heads with roofing cement. If the nail heads aren\u2019t completely covered by the shake above the replacement, apply dabs of cement over each head. Then smooth the cement surface with a putty knife or small trowel. If your shakes or shingles are bonded by sealant and you broke the seal when you removed the old piece, apply a bead of roof sealant or cement around the edges of the replacement shake. Sealing Leaky Joints Inspect areas where surfaces join, such as at a chimney or valley. Look for gaps in caulk, sealant, or aluminum flashing where any objects intersect with or emerge from the roof. These are some of the most common sources of roof leaks, and smaller gaps are easy to repair. Small gaps can be treated with caulk or roof sealant, but larger cracks or tears require patching or new flashing. Apply roof sealant or cement to gaps less than \u20444 in (0.64 cm) wide. Scrape away old sealant, wipe away debris, and dry the area thoroughly before applying a new compound. Use a thin, flexible putty knife to apply roof cement to small cracks in the sealant around chimneys, pipes, or other joined surfaces. For small gaps at the metal or rubber collar of an exposed pipe or vent, apply a bead of waterproof silicone-based caulk with a caulking gun. Gaps larger than \u20444 in (0.64 cm) will require a more substantial fix instead of a simple sealant. Repair rusted or loose flashing at a joint. Flashing is typically made of steel or aluminum, and it seals joints around chimneys, valleys, siding, and walls that intersect the roof. If you find loose flashing, apply a bead of roof cement beneath it, then press it back into place. If a small area of flashing is rusted, slide a new piece of galvanized steel flashing beneath the failing area, then seal it with roofing cement. If you\u2019re any shingles adjacent to flashing are loose, avoid nailing the shingles on the side that makes contact with the flashing. Instead, bond the shingles to the flashing using roof cement to avoid puncturing the flashing. Replace large areas of failing flashing, if necessary. Pry off stretches of unsound flashing and old roof cement with a chisel or pry bar. Measure your chimney, vent, or other joined area, and use a pair of straight cutting tin snips to cut a section of pre-bent base flashing to fit the joint. Your flashing should overlap the joint by about 4 in (10 cm) on each side. Apply strips of ice-and-water barrier to the joint before installing the flashing. For a chimney or other object protruding from the roof, apply strips 4 in (10 cm) up the object\u2019s height. Wrap the flashing around the joint and seal it with roofing cement or caulk. If there are nail holes on the flashing\u2019s edge, drive galvanized roofing nails into them. If you have a shingled roof, you might have needed to remove shingles in order to access the old flashing. Replace them, if necessary, and secure them to the flashing with roofing cement. Properly replacing all of the flashing around a chimney is complex and may require custom-made materials. If necessary, consult a professional.",
