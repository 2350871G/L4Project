Dip a paper towel in oil and hold it between a pair of tongs. Rub the oiled towel over the wok.

Soaking your wok will loosen any food debris, making it easier to scrub off. Avoid extremes in heat when cleaning your wok to prevent warping your wok. For example, don't place a really hot wok into a sink full of cold water or you could damage the wok."
