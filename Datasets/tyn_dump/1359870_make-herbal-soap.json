Use a blunt knife to chop the glycerin into 1 in (2.5 cm) pieces. Alternatively, you can use a cheese grater to grate the block into slivers. Smaller pieces will melt more quickly. For reference, 4 oz (110 g) of melted-down glycerin soap will make 3 bars of muffin-sized soap. Glycerin soap can be found at most craft stores and online. Look in the soap making section. Choose a suspension formula glycerin soap if you plan to add in heavier herbs and flowers."

Some air bubbles will form, but try not to push a ton of air bubbles into the liquid glycerin. Choose fragrances that complement the types of herbs you plan to add. If you're using dried lavender, add lavender essential oils. Pair other dried herbs with other aromas, like eucalyptus, bergamot, geranium, juniper, lemongrass, rosemary, ylang-ylang, or a citrus essential oil. The possibilities are endless! Don't go overboard when adding essential oils. If you add too much to your soap, the essential oils will cause skin irritation. Your soap recipe should never contain more than 3% essential oils. Certain oils shouldn't be used for more than 1% of the soap. Do you research and, when in doubt, use less than you think you need."
