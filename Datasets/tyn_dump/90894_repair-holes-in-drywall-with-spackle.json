                    "description": "Drywall is made from a combination of gypsum, facer paper, and backer paper. When drywall is damaged, these materials cause the drywall to splinter and some smaller fragments will stick out from the wall. If you leave these fragments untouched, the putty won't stick to the wall properly. Using 150-grit sandpaper will smooth the area around the hole if it's badly splintered. Place the sandpaper over the hole and rotate it back and forth between clockwise and counterclockwise a few times. This keeps your repair area smaller than sanding from side to side. You can use 100-grit sandpaper if the drywall isn't badly damaged. If you're patching a small area, like a nail hole, you can simply push the drywall in with your thumb or the base of a screwdriver, then spackle over the indent you make.

        "Use even, measured strokes with the roller or the paintbrush to apply the primer.",
        "Give the primer 3 hours to fully dry.",

        "If you don't have it, go to your local painting store or home center and ask for help to find a matching color.",
        "You can take paint chips home from the store and hold them up to the wall to find the color that's an exact match.",

        "If there's no paint on the tissue, the paint is dry.",
