If your computer can't get that high, you'll probably need to do some upgrades, or get a console. 60FPS is good, and anything above 90 is optimal.

If you have below 40% though, it becomes very important that you reload because those 40% might not be enough to kill your enemy. Remember, switching to Pistol is always faster than reloading."
