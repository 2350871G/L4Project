A makeup primer will help smooth out and conceal any imperfections in your eyelid, and it will also create a smooth base for your makeup to stick to. It will prevent smudging and creasing in any look you create. Apply a dot of primer on your finger, and then gently dab it over your eyelid. After applying the primer, make sure to let it sit for a minute and really sink into the lid."

Begin in the inside corner, moving carefully to the outer corner. Go over this line a few times until it is opaque, and make sure it is thick enough so that you have room to add red stripes. Then, create a wing. Adding a wing to your eyeliner will help highlight the candy cane effect that you\u2019ll be creating. You can find white liquid eyeliner at your local beauty supply store."
