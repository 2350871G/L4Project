                    "description": "Standard horticultural fleece is made out of woven polypropylene. It typically weighs 0.8\u20131.2 ounces (23\u201334 g) per square foot. The heavier the fleece is, the more frost protection the fleece provides. Standard horticultural fleece typically protects plants from temperatures higher than 23\u201328 \u00b0F (\u22125 \u2013 \u22122 \u00b0C). You can buy horticultural fleece online or from a gardening store. If a plant doesn\u2019t naturally thrive in colder temperatures, it will benefit from the protection of horticultural fleece. However, if your plants benefit from some frigid weather or need to enter a dormant period for a successful growth cycle, you\u2019re better off leaving them uncovered."

                    "description": "If you live in an area that stays moderately warm in the winter months, opt for a lightweight fleece that weighs less than 0.8 ounces (23 g) per square foot. It won\u2019t protect your plants from freezing weather but will keep your plants safe from insects. It will also filter sunlight so that UV rays don\u2019t damage your plants. Opt for lightweight horticultural fleece if it typically stays warmer than 32 \u00b0F (0 \u00b0C) in the winter. Lightweight fleece is a good choice if you want to cover potting soil that you want to protect in warmer months as well."

To use biodegradable fleece, dig your plant out using a trowel or shovel. Fill the bottom of the fleece bag with your excess soil and add your plant with the roots facing down.
