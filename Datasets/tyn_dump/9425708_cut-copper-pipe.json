Measure the diameter of the pipe you want to cut and purchase an autocut tool for that exact size. Autocut tools are spring loaded so you won't be able to adjust the size of the cut. For example, for a small 1/2 inch (12 mm) pipe, buy a 1/2 inch (12 mm) autocut tool. Autocut tools come in 1/2 inch (12 mm), 3/4 inch (19 mm), and 1 inch (2.5 cm) sizes."

The pipe should not be able to wiggle or slide out of the tool. Turn the tool 20 to 30 times. Look for the arrow on the tool that indicates which direction to turn it.

You should see a clean cut with no metal filings or debris. If the pipe doesn't easily snap off, use the tubing cutter to make a clean cut through the pipe. Cutting Copper Pipe with a Hacksaw Select the right hacksaw blade. Use a hacksaw with a small gap between its teeth so it cuts cleanly through the copper pipe. Look for a hacksaw with a 32-TPI blade since it has the shortest distance between the teeth. If the gap between the teeth is too large, the hacksaw will snag on the pipe. Clamp the copper pipe, if possible. If the pipe is loose, set it in a vise so that the spot you want to cut extends a few inches (about 5 cm) from the jaws. This will give you space to cut. Spin the handle until the pipe is secured and doesn't move at all. You may need to spin the handle a lot if you're using a thin pipe. Mark the copper pipe. Determine where you'd like to make the cut on the copper pipe. Take a fine permanent marker and draw a line where you want the cut. After you've cut the pipe, you can wipe the mark off using rubbing alcohol. Set the hacksaw blade on the mark. Place the teeth of the hacksaw directly on the mark you made. Hold the handle of the hacksaw with your dominant hand use your other hand to support the top of the saw. Saw firmly into the pipe. Move the blade firmly across the pipe and lift it up as you bring the hacksaw back towards you. Set the blade back into the grove you've begun cutting and continue to push the saw blade into the pipe until the cut piece falls off. Avoid sawing in a backwards and forwards motion because you could damage the blade or make a ragged cut on the pipe. Clean the cut copper pipe.
