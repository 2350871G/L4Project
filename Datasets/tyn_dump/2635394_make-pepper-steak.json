If the resulting strips are still larger than bite-size, cut them in half to divide the length. The grain refers to the direction in which the muscle fibers in the beef are aligned, and it can be spotted by examining your steak for fine lines. Cutting with the grain means will result in tough, stringy steak, while cutting against it will make the steak more tender. If you cannot find flank steak, look for top sirloin, beef round, or chuck steaks, instead. Steaks marked \"for swissing\" will also work."

Begin each slice at this starting point, but do not slice through into the bottom of the stem. Cut straight down from top to bottom, freeing the bottom of each slice but not the top. When all slices are made, use your fingers to gently break them off from the center of the pepper. The seeded part of the pepper, located just below the stem, should not break free. As a result, you should have very few seeds to clean up. Discard this portion and turn your attention back to your strips. Cut each strip into 1-inch (2.5-cm) chunks.
