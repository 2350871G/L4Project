        "Making Dulce de Leche with Regular Milk Pour 1 quart (0.9 liters) of whole milk into a pot.",
        "Make sure this pot is large enough so the milk won\u2019t over flow when it starts boiling.",
        "1 quart (0.9 liters) of milk will produce about 1 cup (0.24 liters) of dulce de leche, so use more milk if you need more dulce de leche.",
        "You can also use different types of milk for a different taste.",
        "Coconut milk works for a vegan option, and goat milk produces a different flavor.",
        "Add 1 cup (128 g) of sugar.",
        "If you prefer your dulce de leche even sweeter, you can add 1 \u00bc cups (160 g) of sugar.",
        "If you prefer it less sweet, add only \u00be cup (96 g) of sugar.",
        "If you\u2019d like, you can also add some vanilla for flavor.",
        "Put either a split vanilla bean or 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of vanilla extract.",
        "Stir the mixture over a medium flame.",
        "Place the pot on the stove over a medium flame.",
        "Stir until all the sugar has dissolved.",
        "After all the sugar has dissolved, you can stir in 0.25 tsp (5 g) of baking soda to prevent the milk from coagulating.",
        "This is optional, but will produce a smoother dulce de leche.",
        "Let the milk boil for 90 to 120 minutes, stirring regularly.",
        "Once all the sugar has dissolved, leave the pot on a medium flame and allow it to boil.",
        "Stir the mixture regularly to help it reduce and prevent it from burning.",
        "As the milk reduces, it will start changing color from white to caramel.",
        "This is a good sign and means that your dulce de leche is nearing completion.",
        "The amount of time you let the milk boil depends on how dark you like your dulce de leche.",
        "If you prefer it lighter, take it off at 90 minutes.",
        "If you want it darker, leave it on a full 2 hours.",
        "Remove the pot from the heat and let the mixture cool.",
        "Place the pot on an unlit burner on the stovetop and allow it to cool.",
        "Stir it one final time while it\u2019s cooling.",
        "Making dulce de leche this way may produce more chunks and solid pieces than using condensed milk.",
        "This is normal.",
        "It will still have a syrupy consistency.",
        "If you prefer your dulce de leche extra smooth, you can pour it through a strainer to mix out any solid pieces left behind.",
        "This is optional and doesn\u2019t affect the final taste.",
        "Pour the mixture into an airtight jar and refrigerate for up to 3 weeks.",
        "If you don\u2019t use the dulce de leche right away, you can store it for several weeks.",
        "Transfer it into an airtight jar or container and place it in the refrigerator.",
        "It can last about 3 weeks if stored properly."
