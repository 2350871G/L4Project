Once they\u2019re completely dry, pull the seeds from each stem by hand. Your seeds will not keep for more than a couple weeks without losing their capacity to germinate, so don\u2019t harvest them until you\u2019re ready to use them. Monkey grass blossoms usually arrive in late summer or early fall. If you do not have access to monkey grass blossoms, you can buy pre-harvested seeds at some garden supply stores."
