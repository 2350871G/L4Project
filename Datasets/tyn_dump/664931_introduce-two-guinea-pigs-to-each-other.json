                    "description": "Sex makes a big deal when it comes to how guinea pigs interact with one another. Before you introduce them, you must determine their sex. Pet shop employees often make mistakes, and if you're buying a guinea pig from a pet store the chance of error is even higher. You should examine your guinea pig on the floor or a very low table. This way, if they get away they will not injure themselves falling. Handle your guinea pig gently, but keep a firm hold around their chest and shoulders. Spread their back legs apart to examine their genitals. The distance between the genitals and anus is greater in males than females. The genital opening of male guinea pigs is shaped like a circular dot, while the genital opening of females forms a Y-shape. For a decisive test, feel just above the genitals. In a female, this area will be soft, but in a male, you will feel a bone. Push in and up (towards the guinea pig's head) from this point. In a male, this will make the penis come out, whereas you will see no change in a female."

                    "description": "Certain pairs work better than others when it comes to guinea pigs. Younger pigs are easier to introduce. They start on a more or less blank slate and then grow and change together. If you already have an older guinea pig, getting a baby of the same sex is a good choice. The adult will not feel as threatened by a baby and its dominance will not be challenged. Its best to neuter males before introducing them to females; however, neutered or not, never place more than one male in a group with females. They will fight over the female's attention. Adult females tend to get along more readily than adult males. Understand that if you house two normal (not fixed) guinea pigs of different sex (one male and one female) together, you will end up with babies. Pregnancy is extremely dangerous for both moms and babies (1/4 of sows die as a result of having babies), so avoid this at all costs."

Placing the new guinea pig directly in the cage with a new one can cause undue stress as they must be eased into a new environment, and their presence may cause the current pig to become territorial. In addition to the emotional concerns, many guinea pig illnesses, which are easily spread at pet and department stores, can incubate for long periods.
