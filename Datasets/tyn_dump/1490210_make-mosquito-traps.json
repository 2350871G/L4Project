    "text": " Making a Bucket Trap Fill a bucket halfway with water. Choose an old bucket and use a hose to fill it with water. If the bucket is very large, only fill it a quarter of the way, as you will need to be able to move the bucket. If you don\u2019t have a bucket at home, recycle an old plastic container instead. Add 4 drops of detergent to the water. Mosquitoes are attracted to stagnant water, as this is where they lay their eggs. The detergent will remove the surface tension of the water and cause the mosquitoes to drown when they land on the water. Gently squeeze the drops into the middle of the bucket. Any liquid washing detergent, such as dish soap, will work for this trap. Stir the water gently with your hand. Avoid stirring the water vigorously, as this can cause lots of bubbles in the water. Stir the mixture for about 10 seconds, or until the detergent is distributed across the top of the water. Your mosquito trap is now ready to catch pesky mosquitoes. Place the bucket under a light to attract more mosquitoes. If you find that your trap is not catching many mosquitoes, move it to a well-lit area, such as under an outside light. This helps to attract the mosquitoes to the water. If you don\u2019t have an outside light, set up a solar light next to the trap. Avoid using electricity near the trap, as this can be dangerous. Trapping Mosquitoes with Sweet Water Cut off the spout of an empty 2 litre soda bottle. Use a sharp pair of scissors to cut around the bottle, just above the label or where the bottle starts to curve toward the lid. Keep the spout, as you will need to use this later. If you\u2019re having trouble cutting the bottle with scissors, use a craft knife instead. Mix 1 cup (200 grams) of sugar and 1 cup (250 mL) of hot water into the bottle. Measure the sugar and hot water into the bottle. Stir the mixture with a spoon until the ingredients are thoroughly combined. Run the kitchen tap until the water is hot.

If your tap water is hot, leave the water to cool at room temperature for 15 minutes. Cover the bottle and then keep it in a warm place for 1 week. This gives time for the yeast to ferment. Place plastic wrap over the container but don\u2019t secure it in place, as the mixture needs to be able to breathe. Store the bottle in a warm, dry, and humid place. A hot water heater closet and a loft are ideal storage locations Place the spout upside down inside the bottle to create a funnel. This confuses the mosquitoes and causes them to get trapped in the bottle. Take the sprout that you cut off the bottle and insert it into the bottle upside down. Line the cut edges of the bottle up so that they are at the same height. Leave the bottle lid off the spout. Secure the spout in place with tape. Use heavy-duty tape (like duct tape) to connect both pieces of the bottle. Cover the entire rim to ensure that the spout and bottle are securely joined. Heavy-duty tape works well for this trap. Place the trap in an area that has lots of mosquitoes. Mosquitoes are often attracted to light and water. Consider placing the trap beside a pool or by an outdoor light.
