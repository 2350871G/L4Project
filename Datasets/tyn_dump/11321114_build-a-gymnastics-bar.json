Repeat the process on the other vertical support to finish the legs. Ask a helper to hold the vertical supports steady while you attach the angle braces so they\u2019re less likely to move around. Attaching the Bar Measure your chest height so you know how tall to make the bar. Stand up straight with your shoulders and heels against a wall so you can get an accurate measurement. Use a measuring tape to find the height from the floor to the center of your chest, or to the top of your armpit. Write down your measurement so you don\u2019t forget it later on. If you\u2019re building the gymnastics bar for someone else, measure their chest height instead. Add 4 in (10 cm) to your measurement and mark it on each leg. Since you\u2019ll have a mat underneath the gymnastics bar when it\u2019s finished, add an additional 4 in (10 cm) to the chest height measurement to be more accurate. Measure up from the bottom of the leg piece to the height you found and make a mark in the centers of the vertical supports. Make sure the marks on the leg pieces line up with one another or else the bar will be crooked when you try to install it. Drill 1 \u20444 in (4.4 cm) holes in each leg on the marks you made. Put a 1 \u20444 in (4.4 cm) hole saw attachment onto your drill. Line up the center of the hole saw with the mark you made on the leg piece before you turn your drill on. Slowly push the hole saw straight into the leg piece to cut a hole completely through it. Cut another hole through the mark on the second leg piece. Don\u2019t try to force the saw through the wood since you could cause the attachment to break or chip the wood. You may also use a drill press to cut the holes if you have access to one. Feed a 4 ft (1.2 m) bar through the holes on the legs. Look for a wooden bar that\u2019s 1 \u20444 in (4.4 cm) in diameter so it fits perfectly in the holes. Push the end of the bar into the hole on one of the leg pieces until the end is flush with the edge. Guide the other end of the bar into the hole on the other leg piece and push it through the wood completely. You can buy wood bars from your local hardware store. You may also use a metal bar instead of wood, but be sure not to use any hollow pipes since they won\u2019t be as strong.

Make sure the screw goes into the wooden bar to secure it in place. Work slowly so you don\u2019t accidentally break or chip the wood. Then add another screw on the opposite side of the leg support 1 in (2.5 cm) over. Repeat the process on the other leg piece. If you used a metal bar, then slide a flange coupler over each end of the bar. Drive wood screws into each of the holes on the flange couplers to secure them to the supports. Tighten the screw on top of the flange to secure the bar in place. Adding Safety Features Install 2 crossbars between the feet pieces for additional stability. Measure the distance between the base pieces of your gymnastics bar and write down the measurements. Trim 2 pieces of 2 in \u00d7 4 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 10.2 cm) boards to the size of your measurement with a handsaw. Position the crossbars so they\u2019re flush with the edges of the base. Drive 2 wood screws through the bases into the ends of the crossbars to secure them in place. You can also add another crossbar in the center of the bases if you want, but it\u2019s not required. Sand the edges and corners of the wood so they aren\u2019t as sharp. Use 120- or 160-grit sandpaper to smooth any sharp edges on the wood so you don\u2019t get injured while you use the bar. Work around the corners to give them a soft, rounded edge to prevent you from getting hurt if you bump into them. Continue working until all of the edges are smooth.

        "If you\u2019re building the gymnastics bar for someone else, measure their chest height instead.",
        "Add 4 in (10 cm) to your measurement and mark it on each leg.",
        "Since you\u2019ll have a mat underneath the gymnastics bar when it\u2019s finished, add an additional 4 in (10 cm) to the chest height measurement to be more accurate.",
        "Measure up from the bottom of the leg piece to the height you found and make a mark in the centers of the vertical supports.",
        "Make sure the marks on the leg pieces line up with one another or else the bar will be crooked when you try to install it.",
        "Drill 1 \u20444 in (4.4 cm) holes in each leg on the marks you made.",
        "Put a 1 \u20444 in (4.4 cm) hole saw attachment onto your drill.",
        "Line up the center of the hole saw with the mark you made on the leg piece before you turn your drill on.",
        "Slowly push the hole saw straight into the leg piece to cut a hole completely through it.",
        "Cut another hole through the mark on the second leg piece.",
        "Don\u2019t try to force the saw through the wood since you could cause the attachment to break or chip the wood.",
        "You may also use a drill press to cut the holes if you have access to one.",
        "Feed a 4 ft (1.2 m) bar through the holes on the legs.",
        "Look for a wooden bar that\u2019s 1 \u20444 in (4.4 cm) in diameter so it fits perfectly in the holes.",
        "Push the end of the bar into the hole on one of the leg pieces until the end is flush with the edge.",
        "Guide the other end of the bar into the hole on the other leg piece and push it through the wood completely.",
        "You can buy wood bars from your local hardware store.",
        "You may also use a metal bar instead of wood, but be sure not to use any hollow pipes since they won\u2019t be as strong.",
        "If you use a metal bar, make sure at least 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) extends out from the sides.Tip: If it\u2019s difficult getting the bar into the holes, try hitting the wood with a mallet or hammer to force the bar in further.",
        "Screw the bar into place so it doesn\u2019t shift around.",
        "Drive a 3 in (7.6 cm) wood screw into the vertical support so it\u2019s perpendicular to the bar.",
        "Make sure the screw goes into the wooden bar to secure it in place.",
        "Work slowly so you don\u2019t accidentally break or chip the wood.",
        "Then add another screw on the opposite side of the leg support 1 in (2.5 cm) over.",
        "Repeat the process on the other leg piece.",
        "If you used a metal bar, then slide a flange coupler over each end of the bar.",
        "Drive wood screws into each of the holes on the flange couplers to secure them to the supports.",
        "Tighten the screw on top of the flange to secure the bar in place.",
        "Adding Safety Features Install 2 crossbars between the feet pieces for additional stability.",
        "Measure the distance between the base pieces of your gymnastics bar and write down the measurements.",
        "Trim 2 pieces of 2 in \u00d7 4 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 10.2 cm) boards to the size of your measurement with a handsaw.",
        "Position the crossbars so they\u2019re flush with the edges of the base.",
        "Drive 2 wood screws through the bases into the ends of the crossbars to secure them in place.",
        "You can also add another crossbar in the center of the bases if you want, but it\u2019s not required.",
        "Sand the edges and corners of the wood so they aren\u2019t as sharp.",
        "Use 120- or 160-grit sandpaper to smooth any sharp edges on the wood so you don\u2019t get injured while you use the bar.",
        "Work around the corners to give them a soft, rounded edge to prevent you from getting hurt if you bump into them.",
        "Continue working until all of the edges are smooth.",
        "Use an electric sander if you have one to finish working on the wood faster.Tip: If you notice any broken pieces of wood, sand them until they\u2019re smooth so you don\u2019t get any splinters.",
        "Put a 4 in (10 cm) thick gymnastics mat under the bar for padding.",
        "A gymnastics mat helps cushion your landing and prevents you from getting hurt if you fall.",
        "Use a mat that\u2019s at least 4 inches (10 cm) thick so you don\u2019t get injured if you slip off of the bar.",
        "Make sure the cushion covers both of the crossbars on the bottom so you don\u2019t land on them by accident.",
        "You can buy gymnastics mats online or from a specialty store.",
        "If you can\u2019t find a mat that\u2019s 4 inches (10 cm) thick, then stack 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm) mats on top of one another to use as padding."
