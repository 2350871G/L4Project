Southern yellow pine is especially receptive to the chemicals. Other woods that aren\u2019t as practical as southern pine only absorb the treating chemicals on their surface, leaving the interior of the wood untreated.

Both black locust and eastern white cedar are naturally resistant to all types of fungus. This makes them an ideal choice for posts that will be in damp ground. Cedar is also an ideal wood for fencing around your house as it is beautiful and has a long lifespan. Because cedar is high in demand, it\u2019s also more expensive than, say, yellow pine.

        "The second person can hold the post upright while you move on to the next step.",
        "Fill the hole with cement until it\u2019s even with the ground level.",
        "Use your shovel to scoop the wet cement into the hole.",
        "Periodically tamp the cement down by poking at it with the tip of the shovel.",
        "This will remove any unwanted air bubbles from the cement.",
        "Continue to fill the hole with cement until it\u2019s level with the surrounding ground.",
