The more splattering, the more dramatic the look. Use just enough sunless tanner to splatter but not enough for it to drip down your skin! Try practicing on a piece of newspaper or even on your thighs to be sure you have the right amount of product. (Thighs are great because you can just blend the tanner in after practicing!)"
