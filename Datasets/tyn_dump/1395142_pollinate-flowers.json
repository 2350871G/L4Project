They have male parts called stamen and female parts called the pistil. The stamen produce pollen, and the pistil attaches to the ovule. When pollen reaches the ovule, the flower is fertilized (or pollinated). Collect pollen from one flower. Touch the stamen of one flower with a small brush or cotton swab.

Use your brush to transfer pollen onto the stigma. Determining the Need to Pollinate by Hand Pollinate indoor plants. Plants have many natural pollinators. Bees, flies, and even wind serve to pollinate plants in their natural habitat. Indoor plants are sheltered from these animals and elements. To compensate for this, pollinate indoor plants by hand. Transfer pollen to outdoor plants that are not getting pollinated naturally. If your flowers on fruit trees are dying before the fruit sets in, flower pollination may not be occurring. One reason for this might be that the pollinator that typically pollinates that plant (for example a particular species of moth) does not live in your area. This can happen if you have plants that are not naturally found in your region. You will need to pollinate these plants by hand. Use hand pollination to create hybrid flowers. By hand pollinating, you can select exactly which two flowers you want to cross. This allows you to create flowers that exhibit specific traits. Hybrid flowers may be a new color, grow taller, or have some other feature that neither of the parent flowers has.",
