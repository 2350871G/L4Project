Apply about 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL) of shampoo to your dog\u2019s fur and use your hands to work it into a lather. Then, let the shampoo sit on your dog\u2019s fur for up to 10 minutes and rinse it out completely. Leaving the shampoo on your dog\u2019s fur will help to soften it, but some dogs might not like standing with shampoo in their hair for this long. Keep it on for as long as your dog will tolerate. You can put your dog into your bathtub at home, bathe them outside with a hose if the weather is warm, or visit a self-serve dog wash.\nShampooing your dog too frequently washes off the natural oils in their coat that keep it waterproof. Always use a shampoo that\u2019s made for dogs since human shampoo can irritate your dog\u2019s skin. Find one that has moisturizers in it, such as aloe vera or oatmeal."

Brush the fur underneath your dog\u2019s body, such as along its chest and belly. Brush your dog\u2019s head, tail, and legs as well. If you encounter a snag or mat in your dog\u2019s fur, don\u2019t try to move through it with the brush. Pull the brush away from the fur and gently brush the snag at the ends to untangle it. This may take a while depending on the size of the mat. Weekly brushing sessions are usually enough to maintain your dog\u2019s fur and prevent mats from forming. However, your dog may require more frequent brushing if it\u2019s shedding.Tip: Always brush your Australian shepherd\u2019s fur after washing it, but make sure its fur is completely dry first."

Use an undercoat rake to brush these areas of your dog\u2019s fur. Then, follow up with a wire brush to get any remaining excess fur off of your dog. Removing the mats will prevent them from growing and impeding your dog\u2019s movement and it will also improve the overall look of your dog\u2019s fur. Check your dog for ticks daily during the summer and fall months. Look between its toes, behind its ears, under its tail, and on its belly. If you find any, use a tick hook to remove them as soon as you can."

This might be necessary if the weather is hot or if your dog has developed mats in its fur. Start with the largest clipper attachment you have to cut down the length and then use smaller attachments if needed to make the fur even shorter. Use the clippers to cut the fur to the same length all over your dog's body except for its head and trim other areas shorter if needed. For example, you might start with a 2 in (5.1 cm) attachment and then move to a 1.5 in (3.8 cm) attachment for select areas. Keep in mind that this can be a difficult task, so you might want to leave clipping to the professionals. Shaving your Australian shepherd\u2019s coat could expose its skin and increase its risk for getting a sunburn. Always leave about \u20444\u2013\u20442 inch (0.64\u20131.27 cm) of your dog\u2019s coat when you\u2019re trimming it to protect its skin."

The quick is the living tissue inside of your dog\u2019s nail similar to the skin under your fingernails. If you cut into this, it will bleed and be painful for your dog. Keep in mind that the quick will be visible as a light pink tissue if the nails are white, but the quick will not be visible if the nails are black. If your dog has black nails, trim \u20448 in (0.32 cm) at a time until a solid black dot is visible. Then, don\u2019t trim any more because the quick is below this point. You may also use a nail grinder on your dog\u2019s nails to file them down. Get the dog used to the sound by turning on the grinder while it's lying down and attempt to slowly file 1 nail at a time.
