Tap water contains small amounts of minerals which build up in your iron over time. This leads to clogging. If you notice that your iron occasionally spits too much water out, it is because it is clogged. Distilled water, on the other hand, can cause your iron to corrode more quickly due to the way water molecules combine with carbon dioxide in the surrounding environment. Check your manufacturer's suggestion. Some irons are safe to use with unfiltered tap water, while others are safe to use with distilled water. When in doubt, a 50/50 blend or filtered tap water would be your safest bets."
