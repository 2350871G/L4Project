Unlike other types of essential oils, peppermint oil is technically an infusion. This means that the amount of carrier oil you use to steep your leaves will determine how much you ultimately end up with.Tip: If you\u2019re picking your own peppermint, the best time to harvest the leaves is just before they begin to flower.
