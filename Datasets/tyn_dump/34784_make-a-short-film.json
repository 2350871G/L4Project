        "Once the actors get onto the set, have them go through a basic reading of the script.",
        "Then, have the actors act out the scene.",
        "As they go through the scene, tell the actors what you want them to do, how to interact with the environment, and let them know of any modifications that you want to see in their acting.",
        "This process is known as \"blocking the scene.\"",
        "The read through of the script can be done anywhere, but you should try to do the blocking on set.",
        "Dress the actors in their costumes.",
        "If the role requires a certain type of clothing or makeup, you'll want to make sure that your actors are in character before you start shooting.",
        "After you rehearse the scene, give your actors the clothes or costumes that they need to wear.",
        "If the actors have to wear a cultural or religious piece, such as a hijab or yarmulke, be sure to study it.",
        "Don't just throw the piece on; be as accurate as possible.",
        "If you are on a tight budget, you can have the actors provide outfits from their own wardrobe, but make sure that what they find meets your vision.",
        "Film the scenes in the movie.",
        "The storyboard that you created earlier will give you a shot list.",
        "Work around actor's schedules and take advantage of days when your filming location is free for filming.",
        "If you have access to a certain location, try to film as many scenes as you can while you're there.",
        "This will save you time and prevent you from having to revisit shoot locations.",
        "You don't need to shoot the movie in chronological order.",
        "You can shoot whatever scenes are the easiest to do, then order them during post-production.",
        "Plan ahead for outdoor scenes, especially if you have specific weather in mind, such as a gloomy, rainy day or a bright, sunny afternoon.",
        "Focus on visuals.",
        "Because your film is short, the narrative will sometimes matter less than the visuals that you are showing the audience.",
        "Choose locations that are visually impressive and make sure that the lighting complements the overall scene.",
        "Make sure that the frame is in focus and that there's nothing obstructing or interfering with the shot.",

        "You can thank everyone as one big group, or you can do it in smaller groups, such as: actors, crew, costume and set designers, etc.",
        "If someone is unavailable that day, be sure to thank them personally, either face-to-face or by phone.",
        "If you encountered any difficulties, such as unexpected weather changes or taking longer than expected, you could thank them with a pizza party later on.",
        "Editing the Film Upload the film to movie editing software.",
        "Upload the video files into video editing software.",
        "Organize each of the scenes into bins or folders so that you have access to the video files quickly.",
        "This will help keep you organized while you work.",
        "Once the files are transferred and organized, you can start cutting them up and editing them.",
        "Examples of video editing software includes: Avid, Final Cut Pro, and Windows Movie Maker.",
        "Choose a program that is easy for you to use and that can perform the exact sort of editing that  you need.",
        "Do a rough cut of the scenes.",
        "Start putting the shots in chronological order.",
        "Review them as you go along and check for continuity and flow.",
        "During the rough cut, you'll want to make sure that the story makes sense.",
        "Make note of any areas that don't flow as you watch the film.",
        "You can then reorganize it later.",
        "In some cases, you may have to re-shoot a scene.",
        "Add audio.",
        "Add the audio tracks of the actor's dialogue and match it up with the video.",
        "You'll also want to take this time to add any music or sound effects that you want in the movie.",
        "Keeping the audio tracks and sound effects separate from the video is important.",
        "This will allow you to adjust things like volume without affecting the video.",
        "Keep the background music and sounds at a lower volume when people are talking.",
        "If they are too loud, you won't hear the actors.",
        "Analyze and tighten up the scenes.",
        "Once you have a decent cut of the film, review it with the producer and other editors.",
        "Take people's feedback and criticism and then go back and re-edit the film.",
        "Concentrate on flow and pacing during the second edit.",
        "Implement editing techniques like fades to transition scenes.",
        "If a scene feels like it's staggering or sluggish, you can tighten up the dialogue by adding cuts in between actor dialogue.",
        "Review the film and create a final cut.",
        "After you've tightened up the movie, review the movie one last time with the producers, editors, and directors.",
        "Get final input on any details that need to be added or altered or issues that may have occurred during editing.",
        "Once all of the people producing the film agree on the final product, you can start showing your short film to people."
