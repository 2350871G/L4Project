Lots of types of peanut butter come with lots of added sugar and partially hydrogenated oils that are bad for your health. If you're looking for a healthier option, try an organic peanut butter. Natural peanut butter may have a layer of oil on top, but if you carefully stir it in when you open the jar and then keep the jar of peanut butter in the refrigerator, the oil will not separate out again. There are lots and lots of flavors for jellies and jams. The two most commonly used are grape and strawberry. However, you could branch out to a sharper taste like raspberry, or a mixture of several different kinds. For your bread you'll probably want something that doesn't overwhelm your other flavors (like a rye or sourdough), so you'll probably want to go for plain whole wheat or white."
