You could also try using double-sided carpet tape in the same way if you can\u2019t find velcro strips. Wedge something between the sides of the frame and the mattress for a quick fix.

This is a good way to temporarily stop sliding, however you will probably have to keep adjusting whatever you wedge in between the mattress and frame, so it is not a great permanent solution. Change your bed frame for a tighter-fitting frame if you can\u2019t stop the sliding. Look at your bed frame and see if it is too big for your bed, or if the sides aren\u2019t high enough to hold the mattress in place. Get a new bed frame that holds the mattress tighter if you can\u2019t stop the mattress from sliding around with another method. A bed frame that has both a headboard and a footboard can help reduce sliding as well. Switch out your mattress for a 1-sided mattress as a last resort. Many mattresses have 2 sides that are exactly the same, which means the bottom side is more prone to sliding. Buy a mattress that has 1 side for sleeping and 1 flat side that goes face down to decrease mattress slippage. 1-sided mattresses can also be more comfortable than 2-sided mattresses because they are built bottom-up for maximum comfort on the sleeping surface. Stopping a Mattress Topper from Slipping Off Place a tight-fitting sheet over the mattress topper. Your mattress topper is more likely to slide around if your sheets are loose. Get the tightest-fitting bottom sheet you can find that will fit your bed and put it on to secure the topper in place. Use sheet suspenders or straps to hold the sheet and topper in place. Clip the sheet straps to the bottom edges of the corners of the fitted sheet. Feed the straps under the mattress and clip them to the opposite corners. The sheet suspenders should look like an \u201cX\u201d underneath the mattress. Pin the topper in place with safety pins for a cheaper option. Pin the mattress topper to the mattress with at least 5 safety pins per side. This will distribute the pressure and hold the topper in place more securely. You can also use safety pins to hold the fitted bottom sheet in place which will keep the mattress topper more stable. Use duct tape or spray adhesive to hold the topper in place if it still slips. Tape the corners and edges down tightly to the mattress with duct tape, or spray adhesive over the entire backside of the topper and stick it down to the mattress. Make sure to use a tight-fitting sheet as well. Note that if you use spray adhesive, there will be some residue left on the mattress if you ever want to rip off the topper. Duct tape can leave some residue on the mattress too if it is left on for a long time. Preventing a Bed Frame from Sliding on Smooth Floors Place an area rug underneath the bed frame. Get an area rug that is slightly bigger than the area the bed covers. Move the bed off to the side and place the rug on the floor, then move the bed back on top of it. The more plush the rug is, the more traction the bed frame will have. Put non-skid furniture feet on the bottoms of each leg if you don\u2019t want a rug. Get furniture feet that are big enough to fit on the bottoms of the legs of your bed frame. Lift up the bed a corner at a time and stick the furniture feet on. You can get furniture feet at most furniture stores or home improvement centers. Slip pieces of rubber shelf liner under the legs for homemade furniture feet. Cut pieces of non-slip shelf liner that are slightly bigger than the bottoms of the legs of the frame. Lift the bed frame up at each corner and slide the pieces of rubber liner underneath. The rubber liner you want to get is the kind used to line cabinets and keep things like glasses from sliding around.",
