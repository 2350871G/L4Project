If you are using a regular frying pan, pour a little oil on it (not too much!) before you add the steak. Then cook the meat until the bottom is brown and crispy. Check to see if it's ready to flip by turning one end up -- if a crust has built, it's time. Brush once more with oil and turn it over to the other side. Don't ever turn the meat more than once; over-flipping it makes it very tough. Now reduce the heat to medium. The cooking time will depend on the type of pan you use, the steak's thickness, and how well done you like your steak. For 3/4\" (2 cm) thickness, about 5 minutes for the first side and 3 minutes for the second side is medium."
