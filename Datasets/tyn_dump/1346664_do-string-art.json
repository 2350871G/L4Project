Veneer pins work very well \u2013 they have small heads that let paper slide easily off (if you're using paper). You could also use small, regular nails from the hardware store. Colored nails can be a nice touch, too, especially if you use more than one for the juxtaposition. A surface. Canvas or wood are the basic options.

Let's weigh the pros and cons:\nFor a paper transfer, you simply find an image or word you like on your computer, and print it to size. You'd place it on the board and put nails into the paper. When you're done, you need to take off the paper up and over the head of the nail. If the nails allow this, it's a good, simple, cheap option. A stencil transfer is easier to work with. You simply put the nails in the holes of the stencil and remove the stencil when you're done (it comes right off).
