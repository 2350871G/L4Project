Turn on the stovetop to a medium-high setting, and heat it for about 7 minutes, or until the coconut cream starts to boil. Use a wooden spoon to stir the coconut cream occasionally as you bring it to a boil. Cook the coconut cream until the liquid thickens. Continue boiling the coconut cream, and watch it start to thicken within approximately 10 minutes. Stir it with a wooden spoon to check on the consistency of the liquid. The coconut cream will start to have a similar texture to yogurt. Don't have the stovetop on a temperature setting that is too high, otherwise the coconut cream could burn and it will be ruined. Simmer the coconut cream and stir the mixture as it separates. Reduce the heat on the stovetop down to low once the coconut cream has thickened. As the coconut cream simmers, the oil will start to separate from the solids within a few minutes. Stir the mixture constantly, and scrape the sides and bottom of the pan to prevent it from sticking. Mixing the mixture will also help to prevent the mixture from burning. Cook the mixture until the curds turn golden brown. Keep the mixture simmering, and continue stirring it. The solid curds will begin to change color. Remove the pan from the heat when this occurs. The latik is the golden brown coconut cream curds that have formed. Drain the latik from the oil. Pour the mixture into a bowl through a fine, mesh sieve. Set the latik aside so that you can sprinkle it on the pudding once it\u2019s ready. Keep the coconut oil, too. You can use this to grease the baking dish that you make the pudding in. Cooking the Pudding Coat the inside of a large baking dish with coconut oil. Use the coconut oil that you just separated when making the latik. Use a pastry brush to cover the bottom and the sides of the dish thoroughly. An ideal size for the baking dish is a 13 in \u00d7 9 in (33 cm \u00d7 23 cm) rectangular pan. You can use a pan that is a slightly different size; however this will adjust the time that it takes for the pudding to set. Alternatively, use butter to grease the dish if you prefer.

Stir the mixture until it has combined, and the sugar has dissolved. Use a whisk to combine these ingredients. The pot needs to be large enough to hold at least 7 cups (1,700 mL) of liquid. Bring the ingredients to a boil over medium heat. Place the pot on the stovetop, and choose a medium temperature setting. Stir the mixture as you bring it to a boil. Use a long-handled spoon, such as a wooden spoon, to stir the mixture so that you don't burn yourself with the boiling liquid. Add 2 1/2 cups (425 g) of corn and cook the mixture for 2-3 minutes. Once the mixture has started to boil, add the canned sweet corn kernels that have been drained to the pot. Continue to stir the mixture as the corn kernels cook for a few minutes. The longer that the corn kernels are cooked, the more flavor they will give to the pudding. Combine the cornstarch and water in a separate bowl. Combine 1 cup (125 g) of cornstarch with 1/2 cup (120 mL) of water. Stir the mixture well to dissolve the cornstarch. Use a whisk to stir the mixture. Add the cornstarch mixture to the milk mixture. Pour the cornstarch mixture from the small bowl into the pot with the milk and corn mixture. Use a whisk to combine the ingredients. You may need to whisk the mixture vigorously to prevent lumps from forming. Cook the ingredients for 5 minutes or until the mixture thickens. Whisk the ingredients constantly as they cook. Remove the pot from the heat immediately once the mixture forms a paste, which should take approximately 5 minutes. Keep a close eye on the mixture as it thickens, as it will form a paste very quickly. Setting the Pudding Pour the pudding mixture into the large baking dish. Carefully transfer the mixture into the baking dish that you prepared earlier. Use a knife or a spatula to smooth the top of the mixture once it\u2019s in the dish to make it even and flat. If you see any bubbles in the mixture, gently tap the pan on your work surface to get rid of these, before smoothing it over again. Allow the pudding to cool for 10 minutes before covering it with foil. Let the mixture cool slightly before you transfer it to the refrigerator. Once the mixture has cooled, cover the exposed top of the baking dish fully. Refrigerate the pudding for 1-2 hours. Leave the pudding in the refrigerator to set. Check the pudding occasionally to see when it has completely cooled and finished setting. Gently insert a knife into the middle of the pudding to make sure that is is firm and thick. Top the pudding with leftover coconut oil and sprinkle the latik on. Once the pudding has completely set, remove it from the refrigerator. Use a pastry brush to add a coat of coconut oil, and then give it a light sprinkling of the golden brown latik. Alternatively, you can garnish the pudding with toasted, grated coconut rather than latik if you prefer. Serve the pudding by cutting it into slices. Use a sharp knife to cut the pudding into rectangular slices. Then use a spatula to remove each slice from the dish, and place each slice on a plate. Maja Blanca is always served cold.",
