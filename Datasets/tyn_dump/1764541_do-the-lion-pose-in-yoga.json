    "text": " Getting Ready Check with your doctor. You should always discuss any new exercise regiments with your doctor to make sure you are healthy enough to perform them safely. Lion pose is not a particularly strenuous pose, but you may choose to incorporate it into a larger yoga practice. Get comfortable. Wear clothing that allows you to move freely and will not distract you. Find a quiet space. Yoga is about meditation as well as physical exercise, so try to find a place free of distractions for your practice. Set up your mat. You will need a soft surface to perform this pose because you will be kneeling. If you do not have a yoga mat, you can also perform lion pose on another soft surface, such as a blanket, towel, or rug. Performing the Pose Kneel on the floor and sit on your heels. Your knees should be a comfortable distance apart and your hands should be at your side. Lean forward. Place your palms on the ground, with your fingers facing away from you, about 6 inches (15.2 cm) away from your knees. Spread your fingers wide and press them firmly into the floor. Roar. Prepare for the full extension of the pose by inhaling through your nose. As you exhale, open your mouth wide, constrict the muscles in your throat, and let out an audible sigh. Stretch your tongue out and down as far as possible. Be sure to engage the muscles in your arms by continuing to push your fingers into the floor as you roar. An alternative is to keep your hands by your side and then thrust them in front of you quickly as you roar. Engage your eyes. As you roar, open your eyes wide while gazing up towards your eyebrows or the tip of your nose. Inhale and repeat. Hold the pose for as long as it feels comfortable. Relax your body as you inhale through your nose, and then repeat the pose on your next exhale. You can repeat the pose as many times as you like. Modifying the Pose Cross your ankles. One variation of lion pose is to cross one ankle over the other. If you try this modification, be sure to switch the cross of your legs and perform the pose the same number of times on each side. Sit with your legs in frog pose. To add a hip opener to the pose, try incorporating Mandukasana (frog pose) into your lion pose. Before extending your arms forward, reposition your legs so that your big toes are touching, but your knees are spread at least as wide as your outer hips. Then perform the rest of the pose as usual.
