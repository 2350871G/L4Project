Cut the trimmed steak into strips that are less than 1-inch (2.5 cm) wide. Turn the strips about 90 degrees and cut the strips into bite-sized cubes. If you find more fat or silver membrane as you're cutting, trim it away. You may be able to buy pre-cut beef tips at the meat counter."

Set the meat aside and place a skillet on the stove. Turn the skillet on to medium-high heat and turn on the stove's ventilation fan.
