The smaller container should be at least as tall as the larger pot; it should not be submerged in the water. Place the candle wax into the smaller container, and set the large pot onto the stove. If you want to add some color to your candle, you can add in some crayons or wax dye. Wax dye usually comes in blocks, and you can find it online or in the candle-making section of an arts and crafts store.

    "text": " Using Wax and Essential Oils Find a clean, glass jar with a wide opening. You will need some sort of heat-resistant container, such as a mason jar or an old candle holder, to pour your melted wax into. Make sure that the mouth of your container is wide enough for you to reach into and that the container can withstand high temperatures. Purchase some candle wax and cut it into small cubes. You can use any candle wax for your candles, such as paraffin, soy, or even old, unscented candles. Cut or break your chosen wax into cubes. Make sure that you have enough to fill your container, plus some extra. Wax shrinks a little when it hardens, and you may find that you will have to add a little extra wax into the container during the cooling process. Heat the candle wax in a double boiler.

If you find that your wax has shrunk a little, simply add more hot wax and wait for it to cool. Trim your wick. Once your candle has cooled, you can remove the chopsticks, and trim the wick until it is about \u00bd inch long. Using Mason Jars, Water, and Oil Obtain a mason jar and floating candle. You want your candle to be small enough to float inside your jar. Your jar should also be large enough to hold some herbs and citrus slices. Cut some herbs and add them to your jar. Fill your jar about \u00bc of the way with some fresh herbs. Consider using some herbs that repel insects, such as: eucalyptus, lavender, lemon, peppermint, or pine. Slice some lemons and limes and add them to the jar. Take some lemons and/or limes, and cut them into thin, even slices. You want the slices to be \u00bc to 1 inch thick. Cut enough citrus to loosely fill your mason jar. Fill the jar with water. Pour some cool water into the jar. Leave an inch or two of the jar unfilled. Add some citronella essential oil. Add about 10 drops of citronella essential oil into the water and stir to blend it. You can use more or less citronella essential oil depending on your preference.

Either wait until it dries out, or dab the water off with a tissue, que-tip or cotton ball. Light and use. To use your citronella candle, simply set it on a stable surface and light the floating candle. The citrus and herb water will keep for a few days, but eventually you will have to discard it.
