Place it in an oven preheated to 325 degree Fahrenheit (165 degrees Celsius), and bake it for approximately 5 minutes or until the crust looks dry.

Add 2 teaspoons (6 g) of powdered gelatin and 1 \u00bd tablespoons (23 ml) of cold water to a medium size, heatproof bowl.

Set the bowl on top, and heat it in the double boiler for approximately 2 minutes, or until the gelatin dissolves. Make sure to stir the gelatin mixture constantly as it heats to help it dissolve. Add the gelatin mixture to the yogurt mixture in the food processor. Once the gelatin has melted into the water, remove the bowl from the saucepan.

Be sure to handle the bowl with the gelatin mixture with a pot holder because it may be hot from the double boiler. Finishing the Cake Pour the filling into the prepared crust. Once you\u2019ve finished mixing the filling, add it to the graham cracker crust in the springform pan.
