You can now use your finish pom pom by attaching it to a knitting or crochet project. Use the yarn tails to attach it to a hat, scarf, sweater, or whatever you want. Making Cheering Pom Poms Layer 10 trash bags on top of each other. Trash bags are usually only available in white and black, but you may be able to find other colors, too. If you are using different colors, then layer the trash bags so that the colors are alternating if you like or keep the colors together. Cut off the tops and the bottoms of the trash bags. Cut off the top 1\" or so of the trash bag where the drawstring is. Discard this material. Fold the trash bags. Fold the trash bags so that the tops and bottoms are lined up. Try to get all of the layers as even as possible. Cut the bags along the folded line. Cut the bags along the fold you just made so that you have a pile of 20 trash bag squares. Cut carefully and try not to leave any jagged edges. Cut slits in the bag. Start cutting from the edge into the center from the side you just cut. Cut slits in the bags every 1/2 - 1\", depending on your preference. Repeat the same cuts on the opposite side. Make the cuts from both ends and stop evenly, leaving roughly 2\" uncut at the center.

Next, take the individual strips and begin to separate each piece of plastic. This will give the pom pom its volume. Crinkle the strips of plastic once they're pulled apart to make it even fuller. Your pom pom is ready to use! Make another so you have a matching pair. Making Tissue Paper Pom Poms Lay out eight sheets of tissue paper. Place the tissue paper on a flat surface and make sure that all of the edges are even. You can use less tissue paper for smaller pom poms, or more for larger, fuller pom poms. Fold length-wise in an accordion-fold pattern. Begin folding at one end of the tissue paper pile and fold the pieces in an accordion-fold pattern. This is when you fold the piece over in one direction first and then in the opposite direction after that. Keep folding in this alternating way until you reach the end of the stack. If you want to make a small pom pom, then cut the strip in half after you do the accordion folds. This will give you two shorter strips that you can use to make pom poms. Cut both the ends of the folded paper stacks. You can cut the ends so that they are pointed or make them rounded. The look of your pom pom will be different depending on which style you choose. Tie the middle of the folded tissue paper. Use a piece of fishing line, a wire, or a thick piece of thread to tie a knot around the middle of the folded tissue paper. Make sure that it is long enough so that you will be able to use it for hanging the pom pom when you are done. Open the layers one by one with your fingers. Take your time opening the layers one at a time to avoid tearing the tissue paper. However, keep in mind that a small tear will probably not be noticeable, so you do not need to start over if you tear the paper once or twice. Hang the pom pom. When you are finished fanning out the pom pom, you can hang it up to display it. Hang it from a hook on a wall or ceiling.",
