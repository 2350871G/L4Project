        "Zucchini is rather moist, however, so you should drain them even if you plan to consume the  noodles raw.",
        "Instead of \u201csweating\u201d the noodles, as outlined in this article, you would be better off placing the noodles inside a colander and letting them drip dry for 15 to 20 minutes.",
        "When done, wrap the noodles in paper towels and squeeze gently to absorb as much excess moisture as possible.",
        "\u201cSweating\u201d the Zucchini Noodles Preheat the oven to 200\u00baF (95\u00baC).",
        "Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with paper towels.",
        "Under normal conditions, you would not want to place paper towels in your oven.",
        "An oven uses dry heat, which could cause the paper towels to catch fire.",
        "Since zucchini contains a large quantity of water, though, the paper towels will quickly become damp enough to prevent them from drying out and catching fire in the oven.",
        "Arrange your zucchini noodles on the baking sheet.",
        "Spread the noodles out in as flat a layer as possible.",
        "If you cannot create a single layer of zucchini noodles, consider using multiple baking sheets instead of just one.",
        "In order to properly drain, all of the noodles need to be touching the paper towel lining the pan.",
        "Otherwise, the noodles on the bottom may not dry out as evenly as those on the top.",
        "Sprinkle the zucchini noodles with salt before putting them in the oven.",
        "The salt will help draw out some of the moisture.",
        "Let the zucchini noodles \"sweat\" in the oven.",
        "Place the zucchini noodles in the oven and let them bake for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the majority of the moisture inside the noodles has dripped or \u201csweated\u201d out.",
        "Sweating is an important part of the process when you plan to prepare a dish with zucchini noodles in it.",
        "It is the most effective way to remove moisture from the noodles, and if you do not remove as much moisture as possible before use, the noodles could actually cause your final dish to become watery.",
        "Squeeze out any additional moisture.",
        "Wrap the paper towels around the zucchini noodles and squeeze the noodles gently to get any remaining moisture out.",
        "Note that the noodles will be dry at this point but no longer soft.",
        "As a result, you will need to cook them further.",
        "Boiling the Zucchini Noodles Bring a saucepan of water to a boil.",
        "Fill a medium saucepan between 1/2 and 2/3 full with water.",
        "Place it on the stove and heat it over medium-high until the water reaches a rolling boil.",
        "Add salt.",
        "After the water reaches a boil, add a generous amount of salt to the water.",
        "The zucchini will absorb the salt as it cooks, thereby becoming flavored on both the inside and outside.",
        "You can add salt before the water reaches a boil, but doing so will cause the water to take a longer amount of time to reach a steady boil.",
        "Add the zucchini noodles and cook briefly.",
        "Place the zucchini noodles in the boiling water and cook until they are tender but not quite falling apart.",
        "The exact amount of cooking time will vary depending on how soft you want the zucchini noodles and how dry they are when you start.",
        "If the noodles are still fairly moist, 2 minutes should be long enough.",
        "If they are very dry, however, you will need to cook them 10 minutes for al dente noodles and 15 for soft, silky noodles.",
        "The main thing to remember is simply to keep an eye on them.",
        "If the noodles start breaking apart, you need to stop the cooking process.",
        "Serve.",
        "Drain the water and transfer the zucchini noodles to individual serving plates.",
        "Drain the water by pouring the zucchini noodles through a colander.",
        "Let stand for 5 minutes or so, just long enough for any excess water to finish dripping off each noodle.",
        "Sauteing the Zucchini Noodles Heat cooking oil in a skillet.",
        "Add about 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of canola oil or your preferred cooking oil to a large skillet and heat on medium-high until smoother and glossier.",
        "Carefully turn and rotate the pan to coat the entire bottom with the hot oil.",
        "When the oil is hot enough, you should be able to spread it in this manner with ease.",
        "saut\u00e9 the zucchini noodles briefly.",
        "Add the zucchini noodles to the hot oil and saut\u00e9 them for 6 to 7 minutes, stirring frequently.",
        "Keep a close eye on the zucchini noodles as they cook.",
        "If you allow them to stick to one spot for too long, they may begin to burn, stick to the pan, and fall apart.",
        "This cooking method produces noodles that are tender yet slightly crispier than those created through the boiling method.",
        "Serve.",
        "Transfer the zucchini noodles to individual serving plates and enjoy.",
        "You can save any leftover zucchini noodles after cooking them.",
        "They maintain their taste and texture for a day or so in the refrigerator, so they can be enjoyed cold or reheated for another meal.",
        "Microwaving the Zucchini Noodles Start with partially damp noodles.",
        "For this method, you should let the zucchini noodles retain some of their natural moisture so that they will cook without drying out completely in the microwave.",
        "You can skip the sweating portion of the instructions altogether or simply skip the part in which you wring out extra moisture using the paper towels.",
        "That said, you may still want to let the zucchini noodles drain in a colander for 10 minutes or so before microwaving them.",
        "If you do happen to dry the zucchini noodles out beforehand, you can still use this cooking method.",
        "Simply add 2 to 3 Tbsp (30 to 45 ml) of water to the dish with the zucchini noodles to provide the noodles with just enough moisture to keep from drying out.",
        "Place the zucchini noodles in a microwave-safe dish.",
        "Arrange them in an even layer and cover loosely with a microwave-safe lid or piece of microwave-safe plastic wrap.",
        "The seal should not be especially tight.",
        "If you use a lid, open any vents in the lid or leave it partially cracked open to vent the dish as it cooks.",
        "If you use plastic wrap, drape the plastic wrap over the top instead of securing it on tightly.",
        "Microwave on high for 2 minutes.",
        "Cook the zucchini noodles until tender but not yet falling apart.",
        "Keep a close eye on the zucchini noodles as they cook.",
        "If you overcook them, they could become soggy, hard, or otherwise gross.",
        "Serve.",
        "Drain the excess liquid and transfer the zucchini noodles to individual serving plates.",
        "There will almost always be excess liquid in the dish after you make zucchini noodles in the microwave.",
        "You can drain the liquid easily using a colander."
