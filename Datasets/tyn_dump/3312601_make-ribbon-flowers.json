Be sure to pull a bit of the wire out of the ribbon and fold it over so that it doesn\u2019t pull through the ribbon when you gather it. Choose felt that complements the colour and pattern of your ribbon. You can buy both at your arts and crafts store or dollar store. The length of the ribbon depends on how large you want to make your flower. For a very large flower use about two arms' lengths worth of ribbon. For a smaller flower, use about half an arm's length of ribbon."
