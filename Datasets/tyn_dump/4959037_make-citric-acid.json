                    "description": "Lemon juice or lime juice are optimal as these fruits have a very high concentration of citric acid, making the extraction process easier. Use a pH strip to test the juice - it should be at about 2 or 3 on the pH scale. Don't use oranges, grapefruits, or other mild citrus fruits that don't immediately taste tart. These are lower in citric acid content and your end result won't be nearly as strong or effective."
