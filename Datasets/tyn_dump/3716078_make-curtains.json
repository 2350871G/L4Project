                    "description": "Start measuring at the top of the window or slightly above it using a tape measure. Make sure you measure the length to the point where you want your curtain to fall on the window or wall and record that number. Then, divide the width of the curtain in half, and add that measurement to the width so your curtain has folds when the curtains are closed. For example, if your window is 90 inches (230 cm) wide, you would add 45 inches (110 cm) to the measurement to make the total width of your fabric 135 inches (340 cm). If you wanted the curtain to hang 4 inches (10 cm) below the window, you would add this measurement to the length. If the window is 80 inches (200 cm) high, you would use 84 inches (210 cm) as your length measurement. In general, full-length curtains and drapes tend to be anywhere from 60\u2013120 inches (150\u2013300 cm) long, depending on the size of the window."

Heavier fabrics are great for filtering out light and making a room cooler and darker. Lighter fabrics are best for letting in natural light and warmth. When you purchase the fabric, remember to add extra length for seam allowances, as well! If you want your curtains to look nice from outside of your house when you\u2019re looking through the window, be sure to opt for a double-sided fabric. Different Types of Fabric\nPolyester is a versatile fabric that's inexpensive and available in different weights, allowing you to choose how much light comes in. Cotton and linen are popular options that have a relaxed feel and allow light from outside to filter in. Velvet and blackout are great fabrics for blocking out sunlight and heat."

        "Then, lay a damp cotton towel over the seam, and move the iron along the seam, holding it in place for 10 seconds in each spot to fuse the fabric together.",
        "Once you have most of your seams done, you will likely have fabric overlapping in the corners.",
        "This is normal, and you can trim it on an angle to make sure the fabric doesn\u2019t become too thick in the corners of the panel.",
        "Clip curtain rings 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm) apart along the top seam.",
        "Position the rings on the top seam of the fabric with a ring at both of the top corners of the panel.",
        "To make the panels look identical, count to ensure that each panel has the same number of rings.",
        "If the fabric for your curtains is patterned, make sure the pattern is facing the right direction before you clip the rings in place.Tip: To make your curtains look classy and purposeful, match the color of the ring clips to the color of the curtain rod.",
        "Slide the rings onto a curtain rod to hang the curtains.",
        "Remove the rod from the window, and position the rings on the rod so the panels have an accordion-like shape.",
        "Then, hang up the rod and adjust the curtains to your preference.",
        "Some people choose to iron their curtains before hanging them.",
        "You can also steam them while they\u2019re hanging up to release wrinkles and creases in the fabric.",
        "Be sure to avoid the seams, as too much heat can cause them to curl or split apart.",
        "Sewing Rod Pocket Curtains Measure the window, adding length and width for seams.",
        "Use a tape measure starting at or just above the top of the window, and measure the length and width.",
        "Make sure you measure the length down to the area on your window or wall where you\u2019d like the curtains to lie.",
        "Then, add 4 in (10 cm) to the width and 12 in (30 cm) to the height.",
        "For instance, if you have a window that is 120 inches (300 cm) wide and 160 inches (410 cm) high, your new measurements would be 124 inches (310 cm) wide and 172 inches (440 cm) high for a curtain that falls directly at the bottom of the window.",
        "Most curtains range in length from 60\u2013120 inches (150\u2013300 cm) depending on the size of the window, but you can make yours a non-standard length if you want.",
        "Choose a durable fabric that will provide enough light filtration for the room.",
        "At the craft or fabric store, opt for strong fabrics that are easy to slide along a flat surface, such as cotton, or linen.",
        "To make the room darker and cooler when the curtains are closed, opt for a soft, heavy fabric, like velvet, which will still be easy to slide on the curtain rod when you want to adjust them.",
        "Avoid using heavy fabrics that don\u2019t slide easily, like suede, as these can get caught or stuck on the curtain rod.",
        "If you want the curtains to look good from outside of the window as well, be sure to choose a double-sided fabric.",
        "Cut the fabric according to your measurements.",
        "Use your new measurements to trim the fabric to the correct size for your windows.",
        "To split the curtain into 2 panels, divide the width in half so each of the panels are an equal width and the height remains the same for each.",
        "It\u2019s best to only have 1 or 2 panels per window, since more than 2 panels can easily bunch together and get stuck on the rod.",
        "If you decide to make 2 panels, be sure to add an additional 4 inches (10 cm) to your width measurement to account for 2 more seam allowances on the sides of the panels.Tip: If you're making a valence or half shade, keep the width of the fabric the same, and shorten the length to give the right coverage on your window.",
        "Add 1 in (2.5 cm) seams along the sides of the panels.",
        "Fold and pin side seams onto the back of each panel, and then quickly iron over them to hold the seam in place.",
        "Use a sewing machine to quickly sew the seams down, or sew them by hand for a more handcrafted look.",
        "Once the seams are sewn down, remove the pins.",
        "It\u2019s important to sew the side seams first to allow the top and bottom seams to have open ends for inserting the rod.",
        "Fold the top of the curtain down 3 in (7.6 cm) and sew it in place.",
        "To make the top pocket for the curtain rod, crease the fabric so that the seam is at least double the width of the rod.",
        "Pin the seam in place and iron the crease to ensure that it stays in place.",
        "Then, use a sewing machine or hand sew the seam into place before removing the pins.",
        "If you\u2019re not sure how wide your rod is, 3 inches (7.6 cm) is normally enough to accomodate most rods.",
        "If you want a tighter fit so the rod stays in place, use the double width method.",
        "Be sure to adjust the measurements of your seam allowances to accommodate this change.",
        "Sew a 3 in (7.6 cm) seam onto the bottom of each panel.",
        "For the bottom seam, repeat the process for the top \u201cpocket.\u201d If you don\u2019t want the bottom seam to be open on the sides, you can sew them closed along the side seam.",
        "If you want to add a footer to the curtain, you can sew an additional line of thread down the middle of the seam.",
        "Slide your panels onto a curtain rod and hang it in your home.",
        "Position the opening of the top seam on the curtain at the end of the rod with the pattern of the fabric facing toward you.",
        "Make sure the seams are facing toward the window, and then hang the rod up on the wall.",
        "If you leave the bottom seam open, you can flip the curtains upside down to reverse the pattern of the fabric."
