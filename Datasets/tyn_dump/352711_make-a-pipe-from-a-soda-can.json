    "text": " Making a Basic Pipe Get a pull-tab aluminum can. A typical 12 oz soda can works fine, as well as a larger \"tallboy\" style can. Make sure all the soda or beer is out of the can and rinse it out with clean water. Let it dry before continuing with the process. Get a needle,  pin or other sharp object. The next step is to make holes in the center of the can's side. A pencil or pen is also an effective hole-poker. If nothing is available, consider breaking the can's tab in half and using the sharp point to create a series of small holes. Make an thumb-sized indention on side of the can. Since you'll want to place your smokables on the other side of the hole you'll smoke out of, make it the opposite side of the mouth of the can. Use your thumb to press in a shallow rut. Poke small holes. Use the needle, pin or other piercing implement to poke a pattern of holes over the basin formed by the indention. They don't need to be big, but the more of them you make, the better. Create a grate-like pattern. Poke a large hole on the side. Pick location which feels most natural to cover with a finger or thumb as you smoke, then use a sharpened pencil or a pen to pierce the can. Remove the tab off the can. Wiggle the tab back and forth on the can until the metal attaching it weakens and breaks away. Work carefully to avoid accidentally dropping the tab into the can.
