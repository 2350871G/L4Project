Wipe off any oil with a rag or paper towel so you can see the mark that indicates the proper oil level. \"Dip\" the stick into the oil reservoir and then take it back out. Look to see if the oil on the stick reaches the oil level mark. It is ideal to check your oil once a week. Add oil if the crankcase is low or empty. Continue checking every 30 minutes. Rapidly leaking oil could mean there is a hole in your oil pan."
