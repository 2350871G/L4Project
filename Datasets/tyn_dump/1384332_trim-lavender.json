In subsequent years, it will produce an ever-larger bush of flowers. The first time you trim lavender, during its second year of growth, you may only get a handful of stalks. By year 3 or 4, you should have 5 - 8 bunches of lavender you can use to dry and use or display."

Taking this precaution will help ensure that the plant doesn't pick up a bacterial disease. You should also make sure the shears are very sharp so that they make a clean cut that will heal over quickly. Avoid using craft scissors to trim lavender. They don't make a clean enough cut. Bypass pruners are your best option. These are spring-loaded with two curved blades."
