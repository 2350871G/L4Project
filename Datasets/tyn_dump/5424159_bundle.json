Wrapping items of clothing around a core and around each other also creates tension. This tension minimizes wrinkling."

        "Carefully pick up your bundle and place it in your suitcase.",
        "Place the \"seam\" side of your bundle face down.",
        "In other words, the top-most loose edge of your bundle should face the inside of your suitcase.",
        "Move the bundle carefully to prevent it from unraveling.",
        "If you wound it correctly, though, the bundle should be snug enough to resist unraveling.",
        "Hold it in place.",
        "Use the interior straps of your suitcase to tie the bundle down.",
        "If the bundle remains loose inside the suitcase, it can move around and may start coming undone.",
        "The straps should be snug and secure over your bundle, but do not adjust them so tightly that they begin digging into the clothes.",
        "Excessively tight straps can cause wrinkles to form in your outer bundle layers.",
        "If your suitcase does not have straps, consider sewing some inside before using it.",
        "Alternatively, you can fill the sides of your suitcase with other objects to prevent the bundle from shifting as you carry the bag.",
        "This may include shoes and toiletries, among other items.",
        "Open the bundle before wearing the clothes.",
        "When you arrive at your destination, you should open the bundle and shake out the clothes to remove any light wrinkles that may have formed.",
        "Unwrap your bundle carefully.",
        "Start with the outermost garment and work layer by layer until you reach the garment nearest the core.",
        "Ideally, you should hang each unpacked item of clothing after removing it from your bundle.",
        "It is easiest to unwrap and hang up the entire bundle at once, but you can remove individual garments from your bundle one at a time, if desired.",
        "Simply unwrap the bundle until you reach the garment you want and remove that layer.",
        "Then, re-wrap the outer layers around the remaining bundle in their previous order and tuck the bundle away again."
