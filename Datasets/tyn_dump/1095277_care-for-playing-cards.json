Check the card measurement on the box and get a pack of sleeves that are the same size. Slide each individual card into a sleeve to protect them. Once all your cards are sleeved, you can easily shuffle them and keep them preserved. You can buy card sleeves online or from a hobby shop. Card sleeves come in standard and matte styles. Standard sleeves have a glossy finish and slide easily on one another, while matte cards have a rougher side to prevent them from moving around when they're stacked. Cards with sleeves are usually thicker than the original box they came in, so you may need to buy a new deck case in order to store them safely."
