Other signs of ripeness include an opaque, dull rind color and dried, dead stem. Harvest squash before or as soon as the vine and stem die. Damage from the sun, disease, and insects is more likely after the vine dies, and overmature flesh can become dry and stringy. You can still cure a slightly immature squash, but it won\u2019t keep as long or taste as good."

From harvest through storage, ensure temperatures remain above 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C). The curing process can ripen immature fruit, but you might be out of luck if temperatures drop too soon. If squash are too immature, an early frost could destroy 80 to 90 percent of your crop."
