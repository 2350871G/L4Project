Tequila and specialty liquor bottles tend to have shapes that make them ideal for converting them into bongs. Look for especially unique bottles to use if you think you might put your bong on display, or if you plan to make a bong for someone as a gift."

A small set of 3 or 4 bits will do just fine; you're just looking to work up to a 1/2\" bit to drill the right size hole for the bowl stem later on. Drill bits come in sets that include as few as 3 bits or as many as 15. A smaller set will of course be cheaper and should be all you'll need for this project, provided that the set includes a 1/2\" bit, as this will accommodate most bong stems."

Check to see if you have a tobacco or \"head\" shop in your area, as stems are typically sold there, or buy one online and have it delivered. A bong stem sometimes includes a bowl; if not, you'll need to snag one of these too. As the hole you drilled was 1/2\" in diameter, you should look for a stem with roughly the same width, and it should be long enough to reach to the midpoint of the bottle so that the bottom of the stem is partially submerged once you fill the bottle with water. Bong stems come in various diameters and lengths. You may have to do some checking to find the right fit for the bottle you're using. If you're unsure about the size, it might be smart to buy a couple different stems and see what works best. An average glass bong stem runs between $5 and $10, depending on where you look. If you do have to buy the bowl and stem separately, make sure the bowl is the appropriate size for the stem (the measurements should be displayed prominently on the package) and attach the two by sliding the bowl onto the thicker end of the stem."

A 2-ounce tube of liquid silicone sealant can be purchased for under $10 most places and is easy to apply."
