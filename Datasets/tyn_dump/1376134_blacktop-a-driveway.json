Take a look at damaged areas before deciding how to progress:\nFor depressions, thin cracks, and alligator cracks (cracks in a scaled pattern), repair them yourself as described below. If the damage covers large areas of the driveway, or if there are long cracks more than \u00bc\" (6mm) wide, the only permanent solution is to hire a contractor to remove and replace the driveway. Also consider this for any asphalt driveway approaching 20 years old. Hiring a contractor to overlay the driveway with more blacktop is cheaper then replacement, but it is not recommended for driveways with drainage problems, or with large areas of alligator cracks."
