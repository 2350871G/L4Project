This gives the meat time to absorb the spices for better flavor. Letting the ribs come to room temperature ensures that they'll cook more quickly, so you don't have to worry about any of the meat being overcooked. Don't let the ribs sit out at room temperature for more than an hour. You run the risk of the meat developing bacteria if you do."
