The head table is the best, the middle is middle, and the losing table is worst. Divide each table into teams. People across from each other are teammates. However, keep in mind that this will change every round. Pick a scorekeeper for each team. This person will play the game, but will also be in charge of keeping track of points for the team he/she is on. Give each table what they'll need to play. Each table should have a spiral notebook to write the score in, 3 dice, a score sheet for each player, and a pencil for each of the four people at the table. Playing Bunco Begin round one of the game. One person at the table will take the three dice and roll them. They will want to get as many 1s as possible, as this is Round 1.

The winning team at the losing table moves up to the middle table. The losing team stays at the losing table. Switch partners. You do not have to do this, but it makes the game more lively. Once each team has moved to the appropriate table, switch partners so that you make up a whole new team. Continue playing. Move to round two (the new number that the teams must hope to roll is 2.) There are six rounds in Bunco. Playing all the way to round 6 completes one hand of the game. Keep score. You should keep score by a team (you and the person you're facing) and individually (how many buncos you've gotten). Determine the winner. After all of the rounds are over, each player should count up the number of buncos they have, as well as how many wins and losses. You can either play that the person with the most buncos wins, or the person with the most buncos and \u2018wins\u2019 wins. Award prizes accordingly.",
