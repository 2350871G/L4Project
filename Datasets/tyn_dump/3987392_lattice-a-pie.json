    "text": " Making Dough Purchase ready-made pie crusts at your local supermarket if you don\u2019t have time to make dough at home. Buy them in circles or sheets that you can roll out, rather than already set in a foil pie pan. Opt to make the pie crust from scratch at home. Remember to make a double batch if your recipe only makes one 12-inch (30.5 cm) pie crust base. Measure the width of your pie dish with a measuring tape. When you cut your ribbons, the dough will need to be rolled at least this wide. Split the dough into two equal sections. Roll out the first section into a 12-inch round. Set it into your pie plate and ensure it extends past the top edge of the ceramic or glass plate. Dough that is slightly cooled in the refrigerator will be easier to roll and cut. Cutting Ribbons Roll out your second half of the dough into a rectangle. Roll it onto a piece of parchment paper, so that you can pick it up easily later. Aim for one-eighth-inch (0.3 cm) thickness. Using a rectangle instead of a circle will allow you to make all the strips long enough to reach across the diameter of the pie. You can cut off extra after you have woven it. Make sure to flour your parchment paper before rolling out the dough with a rolling pin. Wash a plastic ruler. You can use it to help you create straight ribbons. Set the ruler across the shorter side of your pie dough rectangle, at the center. Decide if you want to cut your crust ribbons into three-fourth\u2019s inch (1.9 cm) widths or half-inch (1.3 cm) widths. The smaller the ribbons, the more you can make and the tighter the lattice will be. You may way to start with thicker ribbons on your first lattice pie. Cut a small slit every half-inch or three-fourth\u2019s inch (1.3 to 1.9 cm) across the width of the pastry rectangle. Use a paring knife. Continue until you get to the other side. Turn the ruler 90 degrees. Align it with the first slit. Cut across the long side of the rectangle, across the edge of the ruler, with a pie cutter or pastry wheel. A fluted pastry wheel will make wavy ribbons for your lattice. Realign the ruler with each slit. Repeat until your whole pastry dough is cut into ribbons. Lift the parchment paper carefully onto a cookie sheet. Place it inside the refrigerator while you fill your pie crust. Slightly cooled strips will be easier to handle. When you fill the pie crust, try to mound it slightly in the middle. It will even out as the pie bakes and keep the center from falling. Now is a good time to preheat your oven according to your pie recipe. Weaving a Lattice Remove the lattice strips from the refrigerator. Place them next to the filled pie. Lay ribbons horizontally across the diameter of the pie. Lay them parallel to each other with one-fourth to three-fourth\u2019s inch (0.6 to 1.9 cm) space in between. The closer you set them together, the more work you will need to do to weave the pie. It is important that you space all the strips an equal amount away from each other. For example, if you choose to set them close together, at one-fourth-inch, the vertical and horizontal strips should be spaced one-fourth inch apart. Work one side at a time. Fold back every other ribbon, until the ends of the dough meet on the left side. Grab a new pie ribbon and lay it vertically in the center of the pie. Unfold the strips back down over the center strip. You have begun to weave the dough. Fold back every other strip, using the strips you left last time. This time they will only fold back until they catch on the parallel strip you just laid. Place another strip of dough to the right of the last strip. Make sure it is evenly spaced. Unfold the strips and lay them flat. Repeat folding back half the horizontal strips, placing a vertical strip of dough across the pie and unfolding the strips until you reach the right edge of the pie.  Turn the pie 180 degrees and repeat with the unwoven side. When you finish weaving your lattice, you should have strips of dough hanging over the edges around the entire pie. Pinch the point where the bottom crust meets the end of the lattice with your thumb and index finger. Press in a small \u201cv\u201d to make a crimped edge and repeat around the entire pie. Cut along the outside edge of the pie plate with a pastry wheel or pizza cutter.  Mix one egg with 1 tbsp. (14.8 ml) of milk and a sprinkling of sugar (optional). Brush the surface of the pie with an egg wash. Bake it according to the recipe directions.",
