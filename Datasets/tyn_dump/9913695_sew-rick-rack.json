To ensure that the rick rack will be straight, it is helpful to draw a straight line on the fabric where you want the rick rack to go. Use a ruler as a straight edge and mark the fabric with chalk where you want to place the line. If your fabric already has a visible stitch along the seam where you want to sew the rick rack, then you can also use this seam as your guide. Position the rick rack along the chalk guideline.

Position the sewing machine needle over the bottom of the first wave and arrange the fabric so that you can easily feed it through the presser foot in a straight line. Make sure to use thread that matches your rick rack, unless you want to create a contrast between the thread and rick rack. Sew a straight line along the bottom of the waves. Set your sewing machine to the straight stitch or zig zag setting. Sew along the bottom of the waves on the rick rack. Make sure to sew all the way through the rick rack and the fabric behind it. Finish with a backstitch and then snip the excess thread. When you get to the end of the rick rack, press down on the lever on the side of your sewing machine to reverse the stitch direction. Continue to hold down the pedal. After about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of stitching, release the lever and sew forward until you get to the end of the rick rack again. Hand-Sewing Rick Rack on Top of a Fabric Pin the rick rack onto the fabric. Lay the rick rack on your fabric where you want to attach it. Use pins to secure the rick rack in place. Place a pin every 2 inches (5.1 cm) to 3 inches (7.6 cm) to hold the rick rack in place. Insert the pins so that they are perpendicular to the rick rack. This will make it easier to remove the pins as you sew. Thread a medium to heavy duty needle with 18 inches (46 cm) of thread. Hand sewing through rick rack may be easier with a strong needle. Choose an all purpose needle or a heavy duty needle. Insert the thread through the eye of the needle and pull 6 inches (15 cm) of the thread through the eye. Then, tie a knot in the end of the strand. You may use a matching or contrasting color thread. You may need to rethread your needle multiple times depending on the size of the area you are attaching the rick rack onto. Insert the needle through the underside of the fabric. Bring the needle and thread up through the fabric and rick rack. Then, pull on the needle until the thread has gone all the way through the fabric and rick rack. Bring the needle back down through the rick rack. Insert the needle through the rick rack from the top about 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) from where you brought it up through the rick rack. Push the needle back down and through the fabric. Repeat this sequence until you reach the end of the rick rack strand. To avoid having any visible stitches, do not push the needle all the way through the rick rack if you can help it. Just catch the fibers on the underside of the rick rack. Cut and tie off the thread when you are finished. After you have made all of the stitches and the rick rack is attached, cut the thread several inches from the edge of the fabric. Then, tie the thread in a knot to secure the rick rack stitching. Position the knot as close to the fabric as possible to prevent the stitches from getting loose. Intertwining Rick Rack for Braided Edges Get 2 strands of rick rack in contrasting colors. Braiding rick rack works best when you use 2 different color strands. Choose 2 colors of rick rack that will set each other off and go well with the fabric you are sewing them on to. For example, you could use red and blue rick rack with white fabric, or pink and green rick rack with pink fabric. Measure to see how much braided rick rack you will need. Use a measuring tape or ruler to determine how much rick rack you will need to complete your project. Measure the area where you want to attach the rick rack and record the measurement. For example, if you want to place the rick rack around the bottom seam of a dress, then measure all the way around the seam. Braid the rick rack strands together until you have enough for your project. Hold the ends of the rick rack strands together. You can hold them with your fingers or pin them to the edge of your fabric. Then, weave the strands together as if you are braiding them. Cross 1 strand over the other, then repeat with the other strand. Do this over and over until you have enough braided rick rack for your trim. Pin the braided rick rack to the fabric. Line up the rick rack where you want it to go on your fabric. If you are placing it over a seam, line up the braid so it is centered over the seam. If there is no seam, you can draw a guideline and center the braid on the line. Then, place pins through both strands of rick rack and through the fabric. Place the pins so that they are perpendicular to the rick rack. This will make it easier to remove them when you sew the rick rack into place. Sew a straight stitch down the center of the braid. Position the rick rack under the sewing machine needle so the needle will come down on the center of the braid. Then, begin sewing in a straight line down the center of the braid. Sew until you reach the end of the rick rack, and then cut the excess thread.",
