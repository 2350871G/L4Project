The most common methods of gauging speed are \u201cpacing,\u201d radar, laser, and VASCAR (Visual Average Speed Computer and Recorder). Each are vulnerable to different criticisms:\nPacing. Here, the officer gauges your speed by following behind you for a length of time to judge how fast you are going. You can attempt to discredit this speed reading by pointing out the officer was too far back to adequately follow you at a consistent speed, or that hills, curves, and traffic lights prevented the officer from following you for a sufficient length of time. Radar. This technology uses radio waves which reflect off a car and then are picked up by a receiver. Radar speed readings are vulnerable to certain challenges. For example, radio waves can hit more than one car, or there may be problems with the radar\u2019s calibration. Also, rain, wind, and storm clouds can send back erroneous speed readings. Laser. Laser technology sends 40 beams of light over the course of a second toward the vehicle. The rate at which the light reflects back translates into the speed the car is going. One weakness with laser technology is that all of the beams need to hit the same spot on the car. Also, like radar, light beams could reflect off other cars. VASCAR technology. This fancy name is used for a very simple technology of measuring speed. Here, the officer measures the distance between two points (say a telephone pole and mailbox). Then, the officer uses a stopwatch to measure the amount of time it takes you to pass from one point to the other. The time will then be mathematically adjusted to produce a miles-per-hour reading. VASCAR measurement is obviously vulnerable to claims of human error: the officer didn\u2019t start and stop the stopwatch accurately or did not accurately perceive when you crossed one of the markers."

        "Challenge the determination of speed.",
        "Depending on the technology used to gauge your speed, you can challenge it on the grounds stated above.",
        "Also, you can ask the officer how much training he or she had with the technology.",
        "Asking this question helps cast doubt on the officer\u2019s ability to use the technology properly, and any technology is only as good as the person using it.",
        "Challenge the officer\u2019s identification of your car.",
        "You may also argue that the officer didn\u2019t identify the right car.",
        "If you were driving in moderate or heavy traffic, you could argue that the officer used the radar or laser on the wrong car.",
        "You can ask leading questions to rattle the officer.",
        "If your car is blue, ask \u201cDid you see the other blue car in front of me?\u201d This might fluster the officer.",
        "Request that the case be dismissed, if possible.",
        "At the close of evidence, you should argue that the government has not established that you were speeding.",
        "Be specific and point to limitations in the state\u2019s case.",
        "For example, the fact that an officer received only a half hour of training to use radar technology casts doubt on whether the technology was used accurately.",
        "Also, if the ticketing officer does not show up to the trial, you have the right of dismissal.",
        "Wait for the verdict.",
        "If you are found not guilty or the case is dismissed, you do not have to pay the ticket.",
        "If you are found guilty, you will have to pay the fine listed on the speeding ticket, plus court costs.",
        "Be sure to call ahead and ask how you can pay your fine.",
        "Be sure to bring an acceptable method of payment (credit card, personal check, cash)."
