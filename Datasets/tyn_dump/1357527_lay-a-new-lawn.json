For larger lawns, or to save time and effort, rent a sod cutter from a tool rental service. Grass may be easier to remove when the soil is moist. If using herbicides, follow all product safety information and allow enough time for the herbicide to break down in the soil. Most modern herbicides such as 2-4D and glyphosate (Roundup) will break down within three weeks if used correctly."

You may use compost, rotted manure, peat, or high-quality topsoil purchased at a garden supply store. Do not just place the new material over the old. This can create layers of soil that can be difficult for water or roots to penetrate. Some varieties of perennial rye can grow roots well over a foot long, which is why well-worked soil and annual aeration is so important."

There are other, less common methods of installing a lawn. \"Plugs\" are small pieces of sod that are planted at intervals, then allowed to spread across bare soil. \"Sprigs,\" also called \"stolons,\" are stems of grasses that creep along the ground, such as Bermuda or Zoysia.

If using a blend with Kentucky bluegrass, keep watering with the gentle, more frequent schedule after the first sprouts appear.

Sod, called turf in some countries, are strips of already-growing grass attached to soil. Grass comes in many varieties, so select one suitable for your climate and your intended purpose. Warm-season grass thrives during summer heat, while cool-season grass prefers cooler weather. Grass types are discussed in more detail at the start of the section on grass seeds.

For even distribution, sow half the recommended seeds while walking in parallel rows back and forth lengthwise across the lawn, then sow the remaining half while walking in rows widthwise. If there is no recommended seed density on the packaging, use the following guidelines:\nUtility grass (designed for moderate to heavy use) can be sown at \u00bd ounces per square yard (15\u201320 grams per square meter). Most \"ornamental\" grass (designed for light use) can be sown at \u00be oz per sq yd (20\u201325g per sq m). High quality ornamental grass can be sown at 1 oz per sq yd (30g per sq m). Lightly rake the soil. Use a rake to cover the majority of the seeds with a light layer of soil, no deeper than 1/8 inch (3 mm). This protects the seeds from birds and wind, but still makes it easy for the young grass sprouts to push through the soil. For grass seeds sown in the summer, a thin layer (\u00bc in. or 6mm) of mulch can help retain moisture. Straw or hay mulch is not recommended, as it may contain weed seeds. Stay off the lawn while it grows. Put up signs or temporary barriers if necessary to keep people off the lawn. Do not step on the soil at all until the grass has germinated, which usually takes 10\u201314 days. Walk across it as infrequently and lightly as possible for about six months after planting. Water the seeds. Letting the seed dry out completely will prevent germination. To prevent this, water the seeds immediately after planting with a light sprinkler, just to the point of \"puddling.\" Repeat frequently throughout each day until sprouts appear. After this occurs, water less often, but more heavily, now that the established plants won't be washed away. The exact frequency of watering depends on the temperature, humidity, and grass variety. Increase the watering frequency if the grass turns brown, unless it is the dormant season (winter for warm-season grass, or summer for cold-season grass). If using a blend with Kentucky bluegrass, keep watering with the gentle, more frequent schedule after the first sprouts appear. Look closely for the next few days for a new layer of small seedlings to sprout, as \"KBG\" can take longer to germinate than other species. After this second wave of sprouts appears, you can switch to a less frequent watering schedule. Roll the lawn once the grass is 2\u20133 in (5\u20137\u00bdcm) tall. Once the grass reaches this height, press it down with a light garden roller \u2013 either an empty metal one, or a plastic one filled with about 1 gallon (4 liters) of water. If you do not have a garden roller, you may attempt to lightly press the grass into the soil with the wheels of a rotary mower, or by treading across it carefully, but try not to press it so hard that the soil becomes hard and compacted. Mow the lawn once the grass is 3-4 in (7\u00bd\u201310cm) tall. Do not mow a new lawn until it reaches this height, as it needs uninterrupted time to focus on growing roots. Mow in small increments once it reaches this height, no more than \u00bd in. (1\u00bc cm) at a time, and wait at least a few days between mowing. Once the grass has reached the desired height and the lawn is well-established, mow according to preference. Never remove more than 1/3 of the grass height at a time.",

        "Cool-season grasses, such as Kentucky bluegrass, ryegrass, and fescues, should be sown in autumn, when upper soil temperatures are between 68 and 86\u00baF (20\u201330\u00baC).",
        "Warm-season grasses, such as bahiagrass, centipede grass, carpet grass, and buffalo grass are best sown in spring or summer, when upper soil temperature is between 68 and 95\u00baF (20\u201335\u00baC).",
        "Choose a specific seed type.",
        "If you have one particular look in mind, you may want to pick a single grass species.",
        "More commonly, grass seeds are sold in blends (varieties of a single species) or mixtures (combinations of multiple species) to provide better resilience to disease and environmental factors.",
        "Browse blends and mixtures to find one suited to your lawn's sunlight levels, your preferred grass texture, drought resistance, and durability to foot traffic.",
        "Avoid purchasing low-quality seed blends using the following tips:\nLook for advertised germination percentages above 75%, and an expiration date no more than ten months in the past, for best sprouting results.",
        "Look for grass seed containing less than 0.5% weed seeds.",
        "Avoid annual ryegrass, which dies permanently in winter.",
        "Avoid rough \"agricultural\" perennial ryegrass, or mixtures that include more than 20% of any type of ryegrass, or it can take over your lawn with its rough texture and appearance.",
        "Avoid grass seeds sold without an identifying variety.",

        "Divide large lawns into sections measuring approximately 20 ft x 20 ft (6m x 6m).",
        "Work on each section separately, following the steps below for that section before moving on to the next one.",
        "This lets you divide your work into multiple work sessions if necessary, while ensuring that every section receives all the care it needs.",
        "Sow the grass.",
        "Spread grass seed using a seed distributor or lawn spreader if possible, to ensure even coverage.",
        "Drop the seeds by hand if no other options are available, but always refer to the recommended sowing density on the grass seed package.",
