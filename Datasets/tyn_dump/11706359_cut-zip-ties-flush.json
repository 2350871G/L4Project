        "If you use cable ties frequently for work or at home in your workshop, buy a cable tie gun.",
        "Cable tie guns make it easier to install zip ties and they\u2019re designed to leave a flush cut at the end of your tie.Tip: There are 2 types of cable guns.",
        "The guns that look like literal guns use special rolls of cable ties and are kind of complicated to use.",
        "They also cost $60-250 depending on the model.",
        "The easier option, which is covered here, is to use the guns that resemble staplers and rely on manual pressure.",
        "These guns typically cost $15-25.",
        "Run the excess cable tie through the opening at the tip of the gun.",
        "Wrap your dominant hand around the 2 hands of the tie gun.",
        "Use your nondominant hand to thread the excess zip tie through the slot at the tip of the gun where the two handles meet.",
        "Continue sliding the zip tie through until you see some of it sticking out at the top of the gun.",
        "Adjust the slide or knob at the end of the gun to change the tension.",
        "Zip tie guns can be adjusted to cut zip ties when they\u2019re really tight or really loose.",
        "Each model is different, but there is usually a slide or knob in the handle that you can turn or twist to adjust the tension.",
        "Typically, turning the slide or knob to the right increases the tension, while turning it all the way to the left will clip the zip tie as soon as pull the handles.If you want to total control over the pressure, set the slide or knob all the way to the left and tighten the zip tie by hand.",
        "This way, you can simply use the cable tie gun to cut the zip tie.",
        "Squeeze the handles repeatedly to tighten the zip tie.",
        "Slide the tip of the zip tie gun down to the base of head.",
        "Keep the gun pressed down against the head of the zip tie to ensure you don\u2019t accidentally cut it above the head.",
        "Squeeze the handles gently to close them together.",
        "The head of the cable tie gun will open and close each time you squeeze the handles.",
        "Doing this will tighten the zip tie.If you are only using the gun to cut the zip tie, pull it through the head by hand and pull it tight to secure it.",
        "Then, slide the zip tie through the gun but don\u2019t pull the handles.",
        "Stop when the tip of the gun is flush against the base of the head.",
        "The zip tie will continue to tighten until the gun senses the pressure you set it at, so don\u2019t worry about harming whatever you\u2019re tying.",
        "Continue squeezing the handles until the cable tie gun cuts the zip tie.",
        "Continue to hold the gun down against the base of zip tie where it meets the head.",
        "Keep squeezing the handles together.",
        "Once the gun sense the pressure that you set the gun at, it will automatically cut the zip tie.",
        "Your cut will be flush so long as you keep the head of the gun held against the base of the head while you were squeezing it.If you\u2019re only using the cable tie gun to cut the zip tie, you only need to press the handles once."
