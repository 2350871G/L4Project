        "Matching tissue paper works for a simpler Christmas cracker.",
        "Decorating the Cracker (Optional) Add decorations to your Christmas Cracker.",
        "Once you have tied your Christmas cracker shut, you are essentially done.",
        "You do not have to add \"all\" the decorations listed in this section.",
        "Instead, choose the ideas that appeal the most to you.",
        "Cut your ribbons ends at an angle for a nice finish.",
        "Seal the ends with fray check or clear nail polish to prevent fraying.",
        "This will give your crackers that final elegant touch and make them look more professional.",
        "If you use curling ribbon, consider curling the ends by running them between your finger and the end of a pair of scissors.",
        "Add contrast with another strip of paper.",
        "Cut a strip of contrasting paper 4 inch (10.2 cm) and wrap it around the middle of your Christmas cracker.",
        "Seal the edge with a strip of double-sided tape.",
        "Add a pretty label to the front of your Christmas cracker.",
        "This can be as simple as a Christmas sticker with a Christmas greeting.",
        "If this is for a party, use a \"To/From\" style label  and write the person's name on it.",
        "Use this as a place setting for your dinner party in place of the standard nametag.",
        "Decorate the ends of the cracker with washi tape or stick on rhinestones.",
        "Get fancy scissors and cut a notched or scalloped edge into the paper.",
        "Add mini floral picks to your cracker.",
        "Many craft stores sell mini pine branches, holly leaves, and red berries for decorating gifts and wreaths.",
        "Even though they are small to begin with, cut them down further so they are proportionate to your Christmas cracker.",
        "With hot glue or clear tape, attach them to the body of the cracker or to the ends where the ties are.",
        "For blue, white and silver Winter Wonderland themed crackers, add mini sparkly snowflake ornaments.",
        "Use stamps to make plain paper crackers look more interesting.",
        "An ink pad and a Christmas-themed rubber stamp can add a touch of old time design to a brown butcher paper cracker.",
        "It will make the paper more interesting, but keeps it simple enough to not detract from that cozy, rustic feel.",
        "Decorate the tube with glitter glue.",
        "This works great on construction paper.",
        "If you used gift wrap or patterned scrapbook paper, use the original design as a guide.",
        "Glitter glue can take time to dry, so do this the night before the party.",
        "You can also decorate with puffy paint instead.",
        "Set the table with your crackers.",
        "The cracker is a great way to bring people together.",
        "After all, you need two people to pull apart the cracker snap to celebrate the moment!"
