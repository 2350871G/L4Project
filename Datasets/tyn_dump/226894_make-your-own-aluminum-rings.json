Familiarize yourself with the parts of the lathe and common terminology. A good resource for such information is Wikipedia. Select a piece of aluminum stock that has about a quarter inch of extra metal on either side when sized up to your finger.  Insert the piece of stock into the chuck. The metal can be turned on only one point, but only if the piece short enough to not wobble. Typically, about seven inches is long enough to make several rings, and to allow for some error in work. After chucking up and testing for wobble, select a tool bit for parting. This is necessary for a flat end surface to work with.
