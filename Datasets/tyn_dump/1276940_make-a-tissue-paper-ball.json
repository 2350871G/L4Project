Repeat until the entire sheet is folded into equal accordion folds. If you're using small sheets of tissue paper, make roughly \u00bd in. (2.5 cm) folds instead.

Don't tie the wire around both halves, or you'll end up with a fan shape instead. Leave \u00bd in (2.5 cm) of extra wire if you want to attach the balls to other objects."
