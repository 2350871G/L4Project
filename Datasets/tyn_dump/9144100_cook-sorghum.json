Soak the sorghum overnight so the sorghum absorbs some of the water. Drain the sorghum through a colander. Chewy sorghum is a great replacement for bulgar wheat or couscous in tabbouleh or falafel recipes. If you don't have time to soak the sorghum, you can skip soaking it, although the texture of the sorghum might just be a little nubbier."

Dump the rinsed sorghum into a 4-quart (3.8 liter) slow cooker and pour in 4 cups (946 ml) of water. If you'd like to lightly season the sorghum, you can add 1 teaspoon (6 g) of kosher salt. Cook the sorghum on high for 4 to 5 hours. Put the lid on the slow cooker and turn the heat to HIGH. Cook the sorghum for 4 to 5 hours.
