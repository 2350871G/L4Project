If your facial cleanser doesn\u2019t seem to remove all of your makeup, try using makeup remover wipes or a face wash specially formulated for removing makeup. It\u2019s best to use your hands when washing your face because wash cloths and sponges can irritate the skin. The delicate skin around your eyelids is especially prone to irritation.
