Adjust the machine to the shortest wash cycle to protect the fibres of the wool. This method achieves the best results on beanies that are 100% wool. Wash the beanie by itself to stop other garments from agitating the delicate fibres of the hat and causing it to get too fluffy."

Start the washing machine once you have added the detergent. Unless your hat is white, avoid using bleaching or brightening laundry detergent, as this can damage the colours in your hat. Avoid using regular laundry detergent as this can dry out the fibres in the hat."

Avoid putting the hat on a high-heat drying cycle, as this can cause it to shrink too much. If you don\u2019t have a dryer, consider going to a laundry centre, as air-drying your hat can cause it to return to its original size."

Hold the band where the back of your head would sit and then pull it back toward yourself. Pull the band back about 1 centimetre (0.39 in) to allow room for the hat filler.

These come in different sizes according to how much they will reduce the size of your hat. For example, a 1 centimetre (0.39 in) hat filler will reduce the size of your hat by 1 centimetre (0.39 in). Remove the sticky back from the hat filler and then place it inside the band off your hat. If your hat doesn\u2019t have a band, simply stick the hat filler to the inside rim of the hat.
