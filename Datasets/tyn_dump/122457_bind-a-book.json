    "text": " Binding Your Book with Tape Fold your pages in half. Make sure the fold is crisp by using a bone folder or running the top of your nail over it and smoothing it down. You can choose to fold pages individually or fold multiple pages together. If you have too many pages to fold crisply, try creating packets of signatures. A signature is a group of 4 sheets folded down the center. Stack signatures on top of one another. Staple at the folded crease. You should be stapling with the crease facing down, so the flat part of the staple faces out and the staple \u201carms\u201d rest on the inside of the crease. Use a long reach stapler if your regular stapler can\u2019t reach the middle crease.If you chose to make signatures, staple each signature separately. Make sure you have \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) of margin, if your pages are printed. Any words printed within \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) of the crease will become part of the binding and therefore be impossible to read. Cut a piece of binding tape about 2 inches (5.1 cm) longer than the height of your book. Your tape can be colorful or simple. Make sure your tape is strong enough to hold the book together - avoid masking tape or clear tape. Purchase a linen or cotton tape for the support you need. Place the tape on flat surface and press the book into it. By doing this instead of attempting to place the tape on the book, you will have an easier time maintaining a straight, even tape line. Make sure you press the book into the middle of the tape, since you will need to fold the rest of the tape to cover the other side of the book.If your book is thick, leave a larger margin of tape so you have enough tape to cover the spine and still reach the other side. Wrap the tape around the book\u2019s spine. Use your fingers to guide the tape up so that it sticks to the spine of the book. Wrap the tape all the way around so that it covers both the bottom of the book, the spine, and the top of the book. Reinforce a thick book with several layers of tape. If your book has many pages or several signatures, you might want to try taping it more than once. Repeat the process of taping the book until the book\u2019s binding feels secure. Cut the excess tape. Because your tape was longer than the book itself, you should have some excess tape on the top and bottom of the book. Use scissors or an X-ACTO knife to cut the tape, making sure to cut it as close to the book\u2019s page as possible.Any leftover tape should be trimmed. Avoid folding leftover tape over, as this may make your book harder to open. Using Ribbon to Bind Your Book Ensure your pages have at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of margin on the left-hand side. If you printed your pages using a conventional Word document, you should automatically have 1 inch (2.5 cm) of border. If you wrote your pages by hand, make sure the writing has a margin. If you don\u2019t have a margin, any words on the left-hand edge will be impossible to read. Punch a hole \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) from the top and \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) from the left-hand side. Use a hand-held hole-puncher for a clean look. If you\u2019re having trouble measuring and hole-punching at the same time, mark where the hole should be with a pencil before hole punching. Repeat the process on the bottom of the page. This time you\u2019ll be measuring \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) from the bottom and \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) from the left-hand side. Ensure your holes line up properly. Use a ruler to draw a faint line connecting the two holes. Use a pencil so you can erase the line later on. You can also choose to draw a thick line with pen or permanent marker if you want the line to remain on the cover. Punch holes every \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) along the line. Make sure your holes are on the line. You\u2019ll be threading the ribbon through these holes later on. Measure and cut ribbon that\u2019s twice as long as your book. The thickness and style of ribbon won\u2019t affect the ribbon binding process, so go all out! Choose a simple black tape for a classic look or go for a colorful design if you want something more personalized. Thread the ribbon in and out of each hole. Make sure you don\u2019t completely pull the ribbon through the first hole, since you will to tie the ribbon binding closed. If your ribbon isn\u2019t long enough, remove it and cut a longer piece. Loop the ribbon back through the top and bottom holes and tie. Looping the ribbon a second time reinforces the binding. Depending on how many pages you have, loop it a third time for an even stronger binding. Tie it off with a simple knot or a fancy bow, and cut off excess. Sewing Your Book\u2019s Binding Fold your pages in half. Use a bone folder or the top of your nail to get a crisp fold. You can fold individually or in groups, depending on how many pages you have. Use a ruler to measure how long the book is. If you know your page measurements, you don\u2019t have to measure. If you don\u2019t, or if you\u2019re not using a standard page size, make sure you measure precisely. Divide your measurement by five. This bookbinding method requires five holes at the crease. They should be equally spread apart, but the spacing between the dots will depend on how large your paper is. For example, if you have a paper that\u2019s 8.5 by 11 in (22 by 28 cm) printer paper, dividing that by five gives you 1.7 inches (4.3 cm). Mark the dots (\u201cstations\u201d) on the page with a pencil. Do this on the inside of the crease, and use a ruler to make sure your measurements are precise. These dots are known as stations, with the first station being the one on the \u201cbottom\u201d of the page and the fifth station being the one on the \u201ctop\u201d of the page.For example, if you have a paper that\u2019s 8.5 by 11 inches (22 by 28 cm), your first dot will be 1.7 inches (4.3 cm) from the edge. Then, each progressive dot will be 1.7 inches (4.3 cm) up from the previous dot. Your fifth dot should be 1.7 inches (4.3 cm) away from the top of the page. Pierce each station with an awl. An awl is used to pierce small holes in anything from paper to leather to wood. Make sure you\u2019re using an awl made for paper. If you don\u2019t have an awl, you can use a large needle. Put your needle through the third station and pull about 2 inches (5.1 cm) of thread through the page. Hold the rest of the thread with your non-dominant hand to make sure you don\u2019t accidentally pull too much through.You can use whatever color thread you like, but remember your thread will be visible! Put your needle through the fourth station. Your needle and thread should now be on the inside of the crease. Let go of the rest of the thread and pull it through as needed. Thread your needle through the fifth station and back through the fourth station. Your needle should go out station five and then loop back into the fourth station\u2019s hole, so that it\u2019s once again inside the crease. Go through the second station. Your needle should now be on the outside by station two. Put your needle through the first station and back through the second station. Your needle should go inside the first station and then go back outside the second station. Your thread should now be facing away from the crease. Finish by pulling your thread through the third station. Every station should be threaded, and your book should now have thread both inside and outside of the crease. Tie a knot inside the third station\u2019s crease. Tie the thread to itself and pull firmly. You can tie whatever knot you\u2019d like as long as it firmly keeps the sewing in place. Mastering Single Sheet Binding Tape the edge of your paper with clear tape to reinforce it. This helps reduce the chances that your stitching will tear our. Place half of the tape on one side and fold it over to the other side. Repeat with every page. Use a ruler to measure \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) from the top of the page. For a more dramatic look, you can measure \u20444 inch (1.9 cm) from the top of the page. Make three marks \u20444 inch (1.9 cm) apart. The first mark should start \u20444 inch (1.9 cm) from the edge of the page. Make the marks against your ruler to make sure they\u2019re straight. Repeat the process on the bottom edge. Stack your sheets in groups of four and pierce the holes with an awl. If you don\u2019t have an awl, you can also use a thick needle.You should also use this process to pierce holes in your covers. Measure your thread. Your thread should be about the size of the area times the number of pages you will be sewing. Make sure you cut 6 individual pieces of thread.If you have 20 pages, and your area is 2.25 inches (5.7 cm) long, you will need 45 inches (110 cm) of thread for each thread. Put your binding needle and thread through the first hole on the bottom page. Bring your thread around and tie a knot in the thread against itself. The knot should be on the side of the paper that faces \u201cup,\u201d not the edge.Make sure you don\u2019t tie a knot on the sewing thread. Once you\u2019ve tied the knot, you can trim off the end and tuck it in for a cleaner look. Go around to the bottom cover\u2019s first hole and thread the needle through it. Pull the thread until it pulls the paper flush with the back cover\u2019s edge, and then thread the needle under the first loop you made.Make sure you go under both threads. Thread each remaining hole with a new binding needle and thread, and repeat the looping process. For a more whimsical look, choose a different color thread for each binding hole, or keep all of the thread colors the same for a more uniform style. Repeat the process with each subsequent page for each hole. For a more sturdy book, loop your needle and thread around the stitch below the page you\u2019re currently working on, starting on the third page. Once you\u2019ve threaded the paper, looped the thread, and hooked the needle under the first loop, thread the needle under the previous stitch. Bind the top cover like you would bind any regular sheet. Loop around and under the previous stitch, and then thread the needle back inside and open the book. Tie a knot by looping the thread under the previous page\u2019s stitch.",
