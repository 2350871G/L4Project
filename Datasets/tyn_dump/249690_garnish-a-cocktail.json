If you don\u2019t have a channel knife, you can also peel the citrus in a loose spiral shape. Do your best to keep the peel a consistent width. When peeling citrus the old-fashioned way, turn the fruit as you go rather than trying to angle the blade. This will result in a neater spiral while also preventing potential mishaps. Spiral garnishes make an eye-catching addition to martinis, spirits, and mixed drinks that look a little plain on their own."
