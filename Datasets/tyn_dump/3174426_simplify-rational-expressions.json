        "For example, x2\u22122x\u22128{\\displaystyle x^{2}-2x-8} can be factored as (x+2)(x\u22124){\\displaystyle (x+2)(x-4)}.",
        "So, your expression now looks like this: (x\u22122)(x+2)(x+2)(x\u22124){\\displaystyle {\\frac {(x-2)(x+2)}{(x+2)(x-4)}}}.",
        "Cancel out binomial factors common to the numerator and denominator.",
        "A binomial factor is an expression in parentheses.",
        "You can factor these out, because dividing a factor by itself equals 1.",
        "For example:(x\u22122)(x+2)(x+2)(x\u22124){\\displaystyle {\\frac {(x-2)(x+2)}{(x+2)(x-4)}}}(x\u22122)(x+2)(x+2)(x\u22124){\\displaystyle {\\frac {(x-2){\\cancel {(x+2)}}}{{\\cancel {(x+2)}}(x-4)}}} Rewrite your expression with the remaining factors.",
        "Remember that if you canceled out all the factors, you are left with 1.",
        "This will give you your final, simplified expression.",
        "For example:(x\u22122)(x+2)(x+2)(x\u22124){\\displaystyle {\\frac {(x-2){\\cancel {(x+2)}}}{{\\cancel {(x+2)}}(x-4)}}}x\u22122x\u22124{\\displaystyle {\\frac {x-2}{x-4}}}"
