Be aware of the risks of breeding guinea pigs and consider if this is the right decision for your animal and for you. Never breed guinea pigs for fun. Breeding guinea pigs is risky and can harm or kill your beloved pet. Guinea pig sows have a high mortality rate associated with pregnancy ketosis, which is a metabolic problem where the sow slowly poisons herself and dies of blood poisoning. The piglets are also large, which can cause problems when giving birth (but toxaemia is the main cause of death). If you are considering breeding your sow, stick to the breeding age suggestions to help minimize the risk of complications. If you sow needs a caesarian section because of birth complications, the survival rate is very low. Unless you have designated homes for pups or animals you don\u2019t want to keep after breeding, don\u2019t breed them. Many people who say they\u2019ll take pups conveniently disappear once they\u2019re born."

The cage space will require proper bedding and hay, so consider purchasing extra and keeping a reserve for when you clean the guinea pigs\u2019 area. Also consider purchasing more accessories such as toys or hiding holes for your guinea pigs to enjoy. Make sure you have enough food pellets and water bottles to help keep you guinea pigs healthy.
