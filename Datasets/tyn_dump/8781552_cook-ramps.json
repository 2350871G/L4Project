        "Turn half of the burners on to the highest heat setting, and cover the grill.",
        "Allow it to heat for at least 10 minutes.",
        "Make sure that the grilling grate is cleaned and oiled before you grill the ramps.",

        "Pulse the pine nuts and garlic in a food processor.",
        "To begin the pesto, add 3 roughly chopped garlic cloves and \u00bc cup (35 g) of toasted pine nuts to the bowl of a food processor.",
        "Pulse the mixture until the ingredients are finely crushed.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a food processor, you can use a blender or mortar and pestle to make the pesto.",
        "Mix in the cheese and ramps.",
        "Once the garlic and nuts are crushed, add 3 tablespoons (15 g) of grated pecorino romano cheese and the chopped ramp leaves to food processor.",
        "Pulse the mixture until the leaves are fully chopped and the mixture is completely blended.",
