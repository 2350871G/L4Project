Multiple traps are useful for ensnaring a single mouse, but mice spread quickly so you may have more than one in your home. Avoid poison. The mouse will eat the poison and die somewhere hidden. In addition, the poison can be eaten by children and animals. Glue traps are the least humane. The mouse will either starve to death or chew off its own leg and die in an unknown location."

They often stick near walls when scurrying about. You may find rat droppings or smell urine. Setting the Traps Place a trap. Go back to where you found evidence of the mouse. Now push the trap all the way to the wall. The baited trigger part or opening should be in contact with the wall. For a standard spring trap, the mechanical part should be away from the wall. Mice run along the wall, so this is more likely to attract them and, if the trap is perpendicular to the wall, prevent them from triggering it prematurely. Set multiple traps.

Be sure to wash your hands after handling the mouse and cleaning up your house. Pick up droppings with a paper towel, launder fabrics, and scrub surfaces with soap and water to avoid exposure to harmful bacteria. Making a Humane Trap Get a paper towel tube. Save an empty cardboard tube from a roll of paper towels or toilet paper. Similar objects can be used as long as they\u2019re big enough for the mouse to fit inside but also flimsy enough to not support the mouse\u2019s weight. Stores may also carry humane traps. Check at your hardware store or online. Flatten one side of the tube. Run your fingers along the length of the tube on one side, pressing in as you go. When finished, the tube should be able to rest flat-side-down on a counter or table. Bait the tube. Place bait on one end of the tube. A small dollop of peanut butter, some cracker crumbs, or a sliver of bacon will be enough to attract the mouse. Peanut butter works well because it sticks to the inside of the tube. Balance the tube on the edge of a counter or table. Choose an edge that is a few feet off the ground but also has some free floor space under it. Place the tube flat-side-down with the baited end off the counter, then push the tube until it is half off the edge. If you\u2019re having trouble getting the tube to stay still or balance, you can tape it lightly. Make sure the tape isn\u2019t holding it tight enough that it won\u2019t move when the mouse is inside.

Find an empty container that will catch the mouse. Make sure the container is at least two feet tall or else the mouse may escape the trap. Place the bucket underneath the tube. Your catching container goes directly under the baited end of the tube hanging off the table. When the mouse moves in to get the bait, its weight causes the tube to fall off the table and into the bucket. Check your trap frequently.
