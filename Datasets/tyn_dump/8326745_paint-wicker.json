Spray it evenly onto all wicker surfaces, including crevices and in between weavings. Wear a dust mask when priming. When priming, keep your arm straight and use sweeping, left-to-right motions. Start from the top of the furniture and work your way to its bottom. Keep the spray applicator a few inches away from the wicker. For most kinds of primer, the benefits you receive from extra coats stops at five coats of primer. Save primer by applying no more than five coats. Primer is especially important when changing colors, or when covering over dark colors. Be sure to prime in these situations."
