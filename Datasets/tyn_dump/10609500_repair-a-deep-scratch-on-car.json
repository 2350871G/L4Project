        "If possible, however, it\u2019s a good idea to let your freshly-applied paint sit overnight to give it ample time to set.",
        "Resist the urge to touch or make modifications to your touch up paint as it dries.",
        "Use additional coats as needed.",
        "If there\u2019s still damage visible beneath your initial coat of touch up paint, you can add 1-2 more thin coats to finish the job.",
        "Dab on your follow-up coats the same way you did the first coat, then allow the paint to dry overnight when you\u2019re done.",
        "For best results, plan on using at least 2 coats to cover especially deep scratches.",
        "Seal the painted scratch using a clear coat applicator.",
        "Glide the tip of the pen down the length of the paint line to slowly cover it with a thin, even layer of sealant.",
        "Be careful not to bear down too hard, or you could accidentally take off some of the unprotected paint.",
        "When it comes to deciding how much sealant to use, err on the side of excess\u2014you\u2019ll be sanding the clear coat later to level and blend the repaired surface, anyway.",
        "After applying enough clear coat to cover the new paint, allow it to dry overnight, or for at least 8 hours.",
        "Wet-sand the repaired scratch smooth with 1,500-2,000-grit sandpaper.",
        "Wet a sheet of wet/dry sandpaper with clean water and run it over the raised ridge created by the dry sealant.",
        "To avoid removing too much of the clear coat, apply gentle pressure and use light, swirling motions.",
        "Continue sanding until the damaged area blends in with the surrounding finish.",
        "Wet-sanding is better for detailing jobs, as the wet surface lifts away loose particles as you work, and can even wear down tiny scratches caused by dry sanding or polishing.",
        "Not all types of sandpaper are intended to be used wet.",
        "Make sure the sandpaper you buy is made specifically for wet-sanding.",
        "Wrap your sandpaper around a backing block to make it easier to grip."
