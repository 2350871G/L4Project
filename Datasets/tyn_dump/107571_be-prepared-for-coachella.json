You're not allowed to bring in food or water but you can bring in an empty (non-metallic) bottle to fill at the water fountains. It gets hot out there and the main thing you'll want, but won't want to pay for, is water. Bring all the normal hiking gear. You'll be standing and walking around for a good 12 hours each day (the festival generally runs from 11:00am until around 12:30xm). Ideal items to include: hat, sunglasses, sunscreen, chapstick, insect repellent, any medication, small face washer or wipes for messes and anything else you think you'll need. And always bring a poncho or raincoat, in case. (Check the weather forecast online for the upcoming days.) Strollers for infants and toddlers are permitted. Bring your dancing shoes. They're totally required and they're permitted. As tempting as it may be to dress eccentrically, (think glitter, skin-tight dresses, skinny jeans, leather, heels, etc.) you will definitely regret it. Anyone who's ever been to a festival will agree that a t-shirt, shorts and sneakers will make a huge impact your ability to unwind and fully enjoy all the sights and sounds. Know what you can and cannot take. There is an extensive list available here: http://www.coachella.com/festival-info. In particular, you might be surprised to find you cannot bring in food, water, a blanket, camel pack, instruments, chairs, no Sharpies or markers, no video cameras and no professional cameras. However, your are allowed to take photos and film video on your iPhone, Android, etc. Things that won't surprise you include no weapons, chains, pets, drugs or fireworks. No umbrellas either because they block people's view. There will be plenty of shade tents to snuggle under together."
