        "First, pour in \u20442 fluid ounce (15 mL) of jojoba oil.",
        "Follow that with \u20442 fluid ounce (15 mL) of sweet almond oil.",
        "Add both ingredients to a 1 fluid ounce (30 mL) bottle.",
        "If you add more oil than this, you will fill the small bottle completely, leaving no room to mix the oils together.",
        "Switch to a bigger bottle if you plan on making a bigger quantity of beard oil.",
        "Add peppermint and other essential oils to the bottle.",
        "Pour about 5 drops of peppermint oil into the oil mixture.",

        "You can leave out some of the oils or mix in different oils.",

        "Measure out approximately \u20442 fluid ounce (15 mL) each of coconut oil and jojoba oil to form the base of your beard oil.",
        "Use a fractionated coconut oil, since it stays liquid at room temperature.",
        "Pour both oils into a clean 1 fluid ounce (30 mL) amber bottle.",
        "If you use regular coconut oil that has solidified, heat it briefly on your stove or in your microwave to melt it.",
        "To make a larger amount of oil, keep the ratio of coconut oil and jojoba oil even.",
        "Combine the ingredients in a mixing cup or bowl and divide them into bottles later as necessary.",
        "Add sandalwood and supplemental essential oils to the base.",
        "Pour in about 5 drops of sandalwood oil.",
        "While you may feel tempted to add more, additional drops may leave your oil with too much of a woody scent.",
        "Also add about 3 drops of grapeseed oil to give your concoction some variety.",
        "If you really like the smell of pure sandalwood, leave out the grapeseed oil.",
        "You can also substitute in other oils, such as lavender or chamomile, to customize your oil further.",
        "Make sure you use different pipettes for each oil.",

        "Using and Storing Beard Oil Wash out a 1 fluid ounce (30 mL) glass bottle.",

        "Green and blue bottles are also okay.",
        "Clean the bottle out with liquid dish soap and warm water.",
        "Make sure the bottle air dries completely before you pour any beard oil components into it.",

        "Put the bottle in a pot of water, then boil it on your stove.",
        "Remove the bottle with rubber tongs and dry it.",
        "Leave the beard oil to rest for at least a day.",
        "The beard oil is technically done after you mix it.",
        "However, you should give the oils 1 or 2 days to settle.",
        "That way, the oils stay well-blended and you won\u2019t get an uncomfortable whiff of concentrated essential oil when you finally put the oil on your beard.",
        "Massage a few drops of beard oil into your beard every day.",

        "Work the oil into your beard and enjoy your creation.",
        "To keep your beard healthy, apply more oil every day.",
        "The best time to use the oil is after a shower when your beard is clean and your skin is fresh.",

        "When you start running out, make more in advance so you can give the oils time to settle.",
