Carving your duck immediately will cause the moisture to drain, leaving your duck dry and chewy. Cut off the duck\u2019s wing with a sharpened knife. Slice into the skin and meat of the duck where the wing\u2019s joint connects to the duck\u2019s side. Push the knife completely into the initial cut.

Remove the wing. Turn to the duck\u2019s other side. Cut and remove the duck\u2019s second wing. Carving the Legs Cut the skin between the leg and breast. Slice through the duck\u2019s fat and skin surrounding the leg, revealing the meat. Locate with your knife point the hip joint connecting the leg to the breast. Push your knife point into the hip joint to release. Use your non-dominant hand to hold onto the drumstick firmly.

Run your cut from the top of your bird near the duck\u2019s neck to the bottom. Cut in long strokes to create lengthy slices of breast meat. After you cut away all the breast meat on one half, repeat this step on the other side of the duck\u2019s breast until you have completely removed the breast meat.
