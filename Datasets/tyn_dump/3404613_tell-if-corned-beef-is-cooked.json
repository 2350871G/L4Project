According to the US Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service, you should not cook at less than 325 \u00b0F (163 \u00b0C). Place the beef brisket inside a bag, if desired. You can cook the corned beef similar to how you cook a turkey, in order to seal in the juices. If you are using a bag, you should add 1 tbsp. of flour to the bag and shake it around before adding the brisket. Place the bagged corned beef brisket on a cooking sheet.

Set it on the stovetop and remove it from the bag, if necessary. Insert your meat thermometer into the center of the brisket. If the internal temperature has reached 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius), you can remove it from the heat source and serve it. Aim for an internal temperature between 145 and 160 degrees Fahrenheit (63 to 71 degrees Celsius). Stovetop Boiling Place the brisket inside a large pot on the stovetop. Cover it with water. Bring the water to a boil, then turn it down to medium-low or low heat to allow it to simmer. Place the lid on the pot right when you turn it down. Set your timer to boil the meat for 1 hour per lb (0.5kg) of brisket. This is often referred to as the traditional method of cooking corned beef. Keep a kettle of boiled water nearby. After a few hours of cooking, tip 1 side of the lid up to check that the water is still covering the brisket. Add 1 cup (237ml) of boiled water to the top of the pot, if the water is getting low.

If the thermometer reads 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius), it is cooked. Slow Cooking Place root vegetables at the bottom of the slow cooker at the beginning, if you are using this method. You can add cabbage during the last 30 minutes. Add your brisket to the slow cooker. Add just enough water to cover it. You will not need to add extra water during the cooking process with this method. Cook on the high setting for 1 hour.  Turn down the heat to the low setting. Cook for 10 to 12 hours on low.
