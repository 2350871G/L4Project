Simply replace the oil, milk, or water called for in the recipe with pineapple juice in equal proportions. A yellow or white cake works best, since the pineapple flavor could clash or get lost if you use chocolate or another flavor. Alternatively, you can use a fruit flavored boxed cake, like orange or strawberry. The pineapple juice will complement the flavor of the fruit already included in the cake mix."

Common examples include banana bread, biscuits, and muffins. If the recipe you use calls for oil, you can replace the oil with equal amounts of pineapple juice to create a sweet, moist bread. This substitution can taste especially good if the quick bread already has some hint of fruit flavor, such as banana bread or blueberry muffins."

Note that if a recipe calls for multiple liquids, like milk and oil, you should only substitute the juice for one of the liquids. When making yeast bread, you generally warm the yeast in milk or water before adding it to the dry ingredients. Replace the water or milk with pineapple juice to create a simple pineapple bread. The pineapple taste may not be especially strong, but there will be a hint of fruitiness. Replace the milk in a simple pancake batter with pineapple juice. Your pancakes will immediately get a boost of tropical flavor. You can further accentuate this flavor by mixing shredded coconut into the batter, as well."
