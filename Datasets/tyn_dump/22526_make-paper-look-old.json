This is important in case you accidentally light the paper on fire; you can just drop it into the sink and douse it in water. For this particular method you should write on the paper after the aging process, to avoid losing some of your work with excessive burning. Find a candle or lighter. There is no difference in the effectiveness of each source of fire. Simply use whatever is available to you. Avoid using a butane lighter as the flame is too intense for this type of work. Run the flame along the paper\u2019s edges. Hold the edges of the paper between 1/2 inch (1cm) and 1 inch (2.5cm) above the flame.

If the paper catches fire quicker than you can blow it out, drop it in the sink and douse it in water. Burying Paper in the Yard Dig a hole in your backyard. You want this hole just deep enough to fit a tennis ball. No need to damage your yard unnecessarily. Crumple the paper into a ball and place it inside the hole. Sprinkle the ball of paper with a bit of water; no more than a quarter of a cup. You can rub some dirt onto the paper before you do this; the mud will dirty and smudge the sheet. Fill the hole with dirt. Make sure the paper is completely covered. The dirt will damage and wear out the paper over time, so you\u2019ll need to ensure a snug fit. Retrieve the paper after three to fourteen days. The amount of time you wait depends on how old you want the paper to look.",
