Lay the ribbon length down on a flat surface. Bring both tail ends of the bow to the middle. Overlap them and you'll have created two loops and two tails. Shape the loops if they're not evident. Adjust the proportions. This means checking that both the loops and the tails are the size/length that you want them to be and that they are symmetrical. Fold the left loop over the right loop. Take it around the back and through the center hole. Pull tightly at the center. Finished!  Making a Wire-Bound Ribbon Bow Cut a piece of ribbon. This can be used for gift wrapping, floral arrangements, hair accessories and party decorations. Lay the ribbon length down on a flat surface. Create two loops of ribbon. Bring both halves of the ribbon to the middle and overlap them in the center. There should also be tails at the ends. Hold the ribbon in the center to keep it secure. Wrap and conceal the wire. Wrap a fine piece of wire tightly around the middle (neck) of the bow. Wrap ribbon or tape around the wire to conceal it. Use the same color as the bow or a complementary color.

It can be used for decoration, gift wrapping or accessories. Measure your loops. Make a loop measuring 2.5cm/1 inch 20cm/8 inches in from the end of the ribbon. Pinch it between your thumb and forefinger to hold in place. Fold the loop. Bring the long end of the ribbon up to make a 2.5cm/1 inch loop on the left of the pinched loop. Keep secure between your thumb and forefinger. Alternate sides. Make the same loop, only on the right side this time.
