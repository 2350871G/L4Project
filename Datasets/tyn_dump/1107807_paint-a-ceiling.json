Flat paint will also hide any imperfections in the ceiling. You will also need to choose a color of paint for your ceiling.

When selecting a tone of white, consider which particular shade of white will go best with the color of your walls."

        "Allow 30 minutes for the stain-blocking primer to dry before you proceed to painting the ceiling.",
        "Priming ensures that you'll only have to give the ceiling one coat of paint.",
        "A primer will help stick to the ceiling and absorb the coat of paint.",
        "Stain-blockers cover up unsightly stains on a ceiling, such as watermarks, smoke, and nicotine, and keep them from bleeding through into the paint after the primer has been applied.",
        "Painting Your Ceiling Cut in along the corners with an angled brush if you\u2019re not using tape.",
        "If you're not covering the top edges of the wall with painter's tape, you'll want to use an angled brush to cut in along the edges of the ceiling, where the trim meets the wall.",
        "This brush will allow you to paint more precisely so you won\u2019t risk getting paint on the wall with your paint roller.",
        "Pour the paint into a tray and dip your roller in.",
        "Begin by only pouring about 2 cups (470 mL) of paint into a paint tray.",
        "Do not submerge the entire roller head, or it will become saturated with paint.",
        "Instead, lightly graze the roller across the surface of the paint 3-4 times until the roller is coated.",
        "Set up a stepladder if you have a ceiling higher than 8 ft (2.4 m).",
        "If you can\u2019t reach every part of your ceiling when standing on the floor, you\u2019ll need to stand on a stepladder.",
        "Set up the stepladder under the first section of ceiling you plan to paint.",
        "Then, once you\u2019ve covered the roller in paint, stand on the second or third step of the ladder to reach the ceiling.",
        "Purchase a stepladder at your local hardware store.",
        "Paint-supply stores may also sell stepladders.",
        "Paint the ceiling in zigzag lines with your roller.",
        "Dip your roller into the paint tray and coat evenly, making sure that excess paint has been driven from the roller.",
        "Cover the ceiling with a layer of paint.",
        "Do this by creating \"W\" or \"V\" shapes without ever removing the roller from the surface of the ceiling.",
        "Maintain even pressure on your roller as you move it across the ceiling.",
        "Uneven pressure may cause uneven textures to blot along your ceiling.",
        "Make sure you paint the ceiling before the cut-in line dries.",
        "Paint while the cut in line is still wet to prevent a clear line from forming between the edge and the center of the ceiling.",
        "Paint in sections until the entire ceiling is covered with zigzags.",
        "When you're done with painting zigzags across 1 section of the ceiling, move on and paint another section.",
        "Overlap with the previous section to blend the new part with the paint you\u2019ve already applied.",
        "Don't worry too much about creating a uniform look just yet.",
        "Just make sure that you\u2019ve covered the entire ceiling with zigzags of paint.",
        "Paint over the zigzags with straight lines of paint.",
        "For this layer, move your roller across the ceiling in straight lines.",
        "The lines should overlap by about 1 inch (2.5 cm) so there aren\u2019t visible gaps between broad lines when the paint dries.",
        "This will help even out the paint and give your ceiling a uniform color and texture.",
        "Once the ceiling is covered, let the paint dry overnight.",
        "If you've applied a primer coat, you shouldn't need to apply a second coat of paint.",
        "Clean up and wash your supplies once you\u2019ve finished the paint job.",
        "Tear down the painter\u2019s tape from the walls and light fixtures, and throw away any drop cloths that you put down on the floor.",
        "Wash the paint roller in hot, soapy water.",
        "Also remove drop cloths from your furniture in the room.",
        "Painting Atypical Ceilings Repair damaged drywall before painting.",
        "If you have a drywall ceiling that's in need of repair, it must be touched up before you paint over the ceiling.",
        "If you want to handle the task on your own, pick up supplies at a home-improvement store and repair drywall yourself.",
        "Or, if you\u2019re not comfortable handling the patch-up on your own, hire a drywall contractor to repair the damaged drywall.",
        "Ask the drywall contractor to do a skim coat to smooth out the ceiling once it\u2019s repaired.",
        "Applying a skim coat to the drywall before you paint will make the ceiling glisten after the coat of paint has been applied.",
        "Roll on a single light coat of paint for textured ceilings.",
        "If your ceiling is textured, gently paint a single layer by making straight top-to-bottom strokes with your roller brush.",
        "Overlap the strokes by about 1 inch (2.5 cm).",
        "Do this delicately so that you don\u2019t end up knocking the textured material off of your ceiling.",
        "Applying a skim coat to the drywall before you paint will make the ceiling glisten after the coat of paint has been applied.",
        "If you try to paint the textured ceiling on your own and the job goes poorly, call a contractor to repair the paint job.",
        "Find a contractor in your area by searching online.",
        "For example, search for \u201cprofessional painter business near me.\u201d Paint a vaulted ceiling from top to bottom.",
        "Start in an upper corner of the ceiling and work your way down to the wall in straight lines.",
        "Each consecutive line must slightly overlap the previous stroke by at least \u20442 inch (1.3 cm).",
        "Be smooth and consistent with all of your strokes so there are no curving roller marks on the wall.",
        "Essentially, you\u2019ll paint your vaulted ceiling as if it were a wall."
