The nutrient film technique constantly pumps a thin layer of water through the channel so your plants grow without drowning the roots. Nutrient film systems allow for multiple plants to grow and recirculate water to reduce waste, but the pumps need to constantly run or else your plants may die. Plug the pump into an automatic timer that runs every 2-3 hours if you don\u2019t want the pump constantly running.Tip: Plant roots can grow long enough to clog the channel or drains. Check your channel at least once a week to make sure everything is still flowing properly."

Net pots have slots so water can easily flow through them. Trace the bottom of your net pot onto the coffee container lid with a pencil or marker. Use a craft knife or a utility knife to cut the hole to size so the pot fits tightly inside the cutout section. Continue to shave the sides away until the rim of the net pot is level with the top of the lid. A coffee container can hold 1 plant. If you want to make a larger hydroponic garden, use a large plastic tote instead with multiple net pots. Cut a small X near the edge of the lid for an air tube.

Rotate the lid by 90 degrees and make another slit going through the first one. Make your cut like the hole where you put a straw in on a fast food drink lid. Feed 6 in (15 cm) of air tubing through the X. Use \u20444\u2013\u20442 in (0.64\u20131.27 cm) tubing in your deep water culture system. Stick the end of the tube through the X-shape you cut until you\u2019ve fed in 6 in (15 cm) or until the tube reaches the bottom of the container. Leave enough tubing on top to reach a bubbler machine, or about 1 \u20442 feet (46 cm). Fill the coffee container three-quarters full with a nutrient solution. Nutrient mixes are sold at gardening stores or online, and any mix will work regardless of what you\u2019re planting. Fill the coffee container three-quarters full with tap water.

Space your sawhorses 3 ft (0.91 m) apart so your tote fits between them, and set the piping or rain gutter on top. Make sure the ends of your channel are closed so water doesn\u2019t spill out. Cut holes in the top of your channel to fit your pots. Use a 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) hole saw attachment for your drill to make holes on the top of your channel.

Make sure to choose a hole saw made for the material you\u2019re cutting through. The size of your hole depends on the size of the net pots you plan on using. Make a drain hole in the lower end of your channel and the lid of your reservoir. Drill a 1 in (2.5 cm) hole in the bottom of the channel about 1\u20131 \u20442 in (2.5\u20133.8 cm) from the edge. Make another 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm) hole in the lid of the tote directly underneath the channel drain so the water keeps recycling. You can run a tube between the drain and the lid if you want, but it\u2019s not required. Feed the water pump tube into the higher end of your channel. Use a drill or a hole saw to make a \u20442 in (1.3 cm) hole in the center of the raised end of your channel. Feed the end of the tube 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) into the channel so it stays in securely. You may also make a hole in the top of your channel if you don\u2019t want to feed in from the side. The size of the hole may depend on how thick your tubing is. Fill your pots with growing medium and seeds. Use a hydroponics-friendly growing medium, such as perlite, coconut coir, or vermiculite. Fill each pot so they\u2019re three-quarters full before planting the seeds. Put each seed about \u20444\u2013\u20442 in (0.64\u20131.27 cm) deep into the pot. Hydroponic gardening works best for leafy greens or for fresh herbs. Plug in the water pump so it constantly runs. Make sure the water pump transfers the nutrient solution through the bottom of the channel without leaking. The solution will flow through the channel and the roots of your plants to provide them with constant nutrients before falling back into your reservoir. The nutrient film technique constantly pumps a thin layer of water through the channel so your plants grow without drowning the roots. Nutrient film systems allow for multiple plants to grow and recirculate water to reduce waste, but the pumps need to constantly run or else your plants may die. Plug the pump into an automatic timer that runs every 2-3 hours if you don\u2019t want the pump constantly running.Tip: Plant roots can grow long enough to clog the channel or drains. Check your channel at least once a week to make sure everything is still flowing properly.",
