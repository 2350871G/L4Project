You can buy jersey fabric from a fabric store, or you can cut up a T-shirt instead. Wash the fabric in cool water on a delicate setting, then dry it in the dryer. If the fabric comes out wrinkled, iron it using the cotton setting on your iron. Fold your fabric in half and place a baby onesie on top.

If you don't have a onesie, find some pants and a shirt that fit your baby. Place them on the fabric, with the waistband and shirt hem touching. Tuck the sleeves in and trace 1 inch (2.5 cm) around the onesie. Tuck the sleeves into the onesie or fold them over so that you can see the armholes.

Skip this step if you are making a long-legged onesie. Trace a sleeve onto the fabric with a 1-inch (2.5-cm) seam allowance. Fold your fabric in half. Place the sleeve of the onesie onto the fabric, with the folded top edge of the sleeve 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from the folded edge of the fabric. Trace around the sleeve using a 1-inch (2.5-cm) seam allowance. Cut the sleeve out, then use it to trace and cut the second sleeve. Cut the sleeve through both layers of fabric along the cuff, bottom edge, and sleeve hole; do not cut the sleeve along the folded edge. Once you have the first sleeve cut out, place it onto another part of the folded fabric. Trace and cut a second sleeve out. Cutting the Ribbing Measure the hems for the collar, sleeves, and legs. You will need 2 separate measurements for the collar: 1 for the front piece and 1 for the back. Measure across 1 of the sleeves cuffs; you'll use this measurement to cut 2 pieces. If you are making a legless onesie, measure the entire front crotch flap, including the leg holes. Do the same for the back piece.

Assembling the Onesie Sew the shoulders of the onesie together, including the collar ribbing. Place the front and back onesie pieces together so that the right sides are facing in, including the ribbing. Start sewing at the outside edge of each shoulder, and finish sewing at the top edge of each ribbing piece. Use a zigzag stitch and a 1 inch (2.5 cm) seam allowance.

Once again, fold the seam created by the ribbing and the sleeves/legs towards the ribbing. Hem the inseam if you are making a long-legged onesie. Working from the wrong side of the fabric, fold the inseam down by \u20442 inch (1.3 cm). Press it flat with an iron, then fold it down by another \u20442 inch (1.3 cm). Press it flat with an iron once more, then topstitch it down using a zigzag stitch and a thread color that matches the fabric. Fold and topstitch the ribbing down.

A snap tape is a strip of twill ribbon with snaps already attached. Trim off any loose threads, then turn the onesie right-side-out. Go over your onesie and snip off any loose or hanging threads.
