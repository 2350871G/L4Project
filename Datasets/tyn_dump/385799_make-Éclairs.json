Add sugar, salt, and flour to a saucepan. Whisk together. Stir in milk or half-and-half.  Cook over low heat, stirring constantly(preferably with a rubber spatula because metal utensils like a whisk can cause a metallic custard color), until mixture comes to a boil.  Boil the mixture for 1 minute.  Remove custard from flame.  Temper the custard by pouring a small amount into the eggs in the small mixing bowl.  Whisk the custard and eggs together.  Add egg and custard mixture to the remaining custard in saucepan.  Whisk together.  Bring to boiling point.  Cool custard and blend in vanilla.  Cover custard with plastic food wrap and chill.  Making The Pastry Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230C).  Add butter and 1 cup water to saucepan.  Bring to a boil.  Add flour and stir in with a sturdy spoon.  Cook flour mixture for 1 minute, stirring constantly.  Add eggs, one-at-a-time, beating well after each addition.  Cook in pan until the mixture does not stick to the side.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  With pastry tube squeeze out 4-inch (10cm) fingers onto prepared baking sheet.  Bake 15 minutes, then turn the temperature down to 325 degrees F (165C), and bake for another 35 minutes. The \u00e9clair shells are done when they make a hollow sound when tapped. Let cool.  Insert plain pastry tube into pastry bag.  Fill pastry bag with custard filling.  Insert pastry tube into end of \u00e9clair and fill with custard. Alternatively, split \u00e9clair pastries vertically in half. Spread custard filling between halves. Place the halves together. Drizzle with chocolate glaze.  Chill until ready to serve.  Making the Glaze Melt butter and chocolate together in a small saucepan.  Add powdered sugar and boiling water.  Stir until smooth.  Drizzle over \u00e9clairs. ",
