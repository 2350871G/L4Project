You don\u2019t have to cook it as long as if you were to make the rice from scratch and the texture will be very pudding-like. This is the traditional way to make arroz con leche, which is the Spanish and Latin American version of rice with milk. For example, if you have 1 cup (195 g) of cooked rice, combine it with 1 cup (236 mL) of milk. Make sure that you only use unflavored cooked rice for this. You can use short-grain, long-grain, white or brown rice. Whole milk will give the rice pudding the richest flavor. However, you can use 2% or low-fat milk if you prefer. Avoid using skim milk as it is too watery. If you want a non-dairy option, try using coconut milk or almond milk."

        "Simmer the mixture over low heat for about 20-25 minutes, stirring twice.",
        "Continue to let the rice and milk cook until it has thickened but there is still creamy liquid visible.",
        "Stir the pot after the first 10 minutes and after 18 minutes to mix the rice and milk together and check the consistency.",

        "It\u2019s much easier to add more of an ingredient to make the flavor stronger than to fix the pudding if you add too much of something.",

        "Try adding about 1 tbsp (15 g) of grated orange, lemon, grapefruit, or lime zest after you add the sweetener and salt.",
