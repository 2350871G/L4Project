Buy enough fabric so that you can create a blanket that fits within the measurements that you took down. Your goals for the blanket should drive which fabric you choose. You can also buy these fabrics online. Purchase additional fabric in case you make a mistake and need to start over. You can purchase waterproof/breathable materials from companies like Polartec, eVent, Pertex, and Gore-Tex.
