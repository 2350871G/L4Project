                    "description": "Choose a lightweight fabric in a pattern that you'd like for the dress. Cut a 5 x 12 in (12 x 30 cm) rectangle that will make the bodice and cut a 2.5 x 6 in (6 x 15 cm) rectangle for the skirt. Wrap the bodice around the Barbie so you can see what size to make it. Gather the top of the large rectangle together and sew the smaller rectangle to it. Attach a 4 in (10 cm) long strip of velcro along the back and stick the dress shut. You can embellish the shirts and dresses by sewing on straps or using different types of fabric. Try making a simple dress using an old shirt sleeve in your favorite fabric."

Trim an end of the fabric until it's the length you want the shirt or dress to be. Snip arm holes out near the top of each side and slip the shirt or dress onto your Barbie doll. Dress socks will make softer dresses that lay well on your Barbie doll while woolen socks will make rustic looking dresses."

Unfold the trimmed fabric to reveal a circle. Cut out a small 3 in (7.5 cm) circle in the center so you can push your Barbie doll's legs through. Pull the skirt up and onto the Barbie's waist. Wrap a 4 in (10 cm) long strip of fabric around the waist to secure the skirt. You can use cotton, satin, lace, velvet, or any sturdy fabric. If you want a lighter fabric such as tulle, you'll need to use several layers to fill out the skirt."
