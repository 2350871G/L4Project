If you have an analog hygrometer, turn the knob to adjust it to 75 percent. If you have a digital hygrometer, use the buttons to adjust it to 75 percent. If you can't adjust your hygrometer, take note of how many percentage points higher or lower than 75 percent it is. Next time you use your hygrometer, add or subtract a few percentage points for an accurate reading."
