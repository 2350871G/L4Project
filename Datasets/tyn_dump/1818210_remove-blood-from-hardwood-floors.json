    "text": " Unfinished Hardwood Floor Blot the excess blood on the hardwood floor with a dry cloth or paper towel. Do not rub, just blot as rubbing can cause the blood stain to spread or go deeper. Sprinkle the affected area with baking soda.  Dip a brush in white vinegar and use it to gently scrub the stained area.  Wipe the area thoroughly with a dry clean cloth. If the stain is still visible, try using hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide can bleach your hardwood floor so be cautious when using it especially if you have a dark hardwood floor. Apply hydrogen peroxide on a white cloth.  Scrub the blood stain gently with the cloth.  Wipe the affected area with a damp cloth. Rinse the area thoroughly to remove all the residues. Dry the hardwood floor using a towel or cloth.  Waxed Hardwood Floor Use a clean cloth or paper towel to blot the excess blood on your hardwood floor.  Mix 1/2 tablespoon of liquid dish-washing detergent with 1 cup of cold water in a small bowl to make a detergent solution.  Moisten a cloth with the detergent solution.  Use the cloth to wipe the affected area and to remove the remaining blood.  Rinse the area thoroughly using a damp cloth to remove any residue.  Dry the hardwood floor with a dry towel or cloth. Check if the blood stain is still visible. If the stain is still noticeable, dip a superfine steel wool (number 0000) in liquid wax.  Lightly rub the affected area with the steel wool. The steel wool should remove only a fine layer of the surface on your hardwood floor. The rubbing might turn the waxed hardwood floor dull, but the liquid wax will shine it up. Wipe the surface clean with a soft cloth.  Wax or polish the floor if needed.  Urethane or Polyurethane Finished Hardwood Floor Wipe the blood on the hardwood floor with a damp sponge.  Rinse the sponge. Repeat the wiping process until the blood is gone. Use a damp cloth to wipe the floor. Wipe thoroughly to remove any remaining blood stain. Dry the wood using a towel or cloth. If the blood stain is still visible, do the following steps. Buff the affected area with a cloth moistened with mineral spirits. Do this lightly. Wipe the area with a clean cloth. If the blood stain is still visible, repeat the process but this time use a steel wool (number 0000). Rub the stained area using a steel wool moistened with mineral spirits. Do this lightly and make sure you rub along the grain of the wood. Try to remove only as much finish as you have to. Use a soft cloth to wipe the floor surface clean.  Refinish the affected area after 24 hours, if needed. ",
