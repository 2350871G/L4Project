If you want to clearly display all your medals, try putting nails in a long row with 3 inches (7.6 cm) between them. Otherwise, you can hang multiple medals on a single nail if you don\u2019t have the wall space. If you want more support, use a stud finder to locate the studs in your wall. Drive the nails into the studs so they\u2019re less likely to come loose. Heavier medals may pull nails out of drywall and cause damage to your wall. Nails should be able to support your medals, but if you notice the nail sagging or if it falls out, try using drywall anchors instead."

        "If the rack doesn\u2019t have enough hooks for all of your medals, hang multiple medals from a single hook.",
        "If you\u2019re unable to find a rack with the number of pegs you want, try making your own rack.",
        "Drill holes every 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) along a 1 in \u00d7 4 in (2.5 cm \u00d7 10.2 cm) board.",

        "Tie the ribbons to a curtain rod if you want to hang them in a line.",
        "Mount a curtain rod on your wall so it\u2019s level to prevent the medals from sliding around.",
        "Drape the closed end of the ribbon over the rod so it forms a loop.",
        "Feed the medal through the loop and pull it down to tighten the ribbon the curtain rod.",
        "Continue adding the rest of your ribbons to the rod in the same way.",
        "Try arranging the medals by their colors or sizes so they aren\u2019t in a random order, which can make them look cluttered.",
        "Try to organize your medals by the colors of their ribbons to help make them more visually pleasing to look at.",
        "Ribbon lengths may vary so the medals may not line up perfectly after you hang them.",

        "Add more medals that have similar colors or lengths to the section you\u2019re working on until you can\u2019t fit anymore.",
        "Continue adding medals to the next highest rack section, ensuring the medals don\u2019t overlap.",
        "Work your way toward the top of the rack, putting the smallest or shortest medals on the highest section so they don\u2019t block your view of others.",
        "You can buy ribbon display racks online or from a sporting goods store.",
        "Avoid starting on the top section of the rack since you will have to move ribbons and medals out of the way when you want to add more.",

        "If you can\u2019t use a piece of sporting equipment as a rack, simply display it next to your medals as a decoration.",
        "Mounting a Medal in a Frame Choose a shadow box frame large enough for your medal.",
        "You can display a single medal or multiple inside a frame depending on their sizes.",
        "Try to pick a shadow box that\u2019s about 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) taller than the medal and ribbon and has a frame that matches the rest of your home\u2019s decor so it doesn\u2019t clash.",
        "Make sure the shadow box is about 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep so you can hang the medal without it touching the glass.",
        "Avoid using standard picture frames as displays since you won\u2019t be able to fit a medal inside of it.",
        "You can buy shadow boxes online or from home goods stores.",
        "Avoid getting a shadow box any deeper than 1 inch (2.5 cm) since it could be difficult to see or read the medal when you look at it.",

        "Draw a line on the backing board at the top of the medal\u2019s ribbon.",
        "Hold the medal in place with your nondominant hand so it doesn\u2019t move around while you work.",
        "Draw a line across the top edge of the ribbon with a pencil so you know where to hang the medal.",
        "Only use light pressure so your line doesn\u2019t get too dark, or else it may be visible after you hang your medal.",

        "Apply light pressure as you drag the knife along the line, and keep the blade flush against the straightedge.",
        "When you reach the end of the line, check if you cut through to the other side of the backing board.",
        "If not, continue cutting along the line until you do.",
        "Work slowly to keep your cuts precise and prevent the backing board from getting damaged.",
        "Always cut away from your body so you don\u2019t injure yourself if the blade slips.Tip: If you can see any pencil marks after you make your cut, use an eraser to get rid of them.",
        "Make 1 in (2.5 cm) cuts down from each end of the slit.",
        "Lay your straightedge vertically so it\u2019s perpendicular to the end of your first cut.",

        "Stop cutting after about 1 inch (2.5 cm).",
        "Place your straightedge on the other end of the first line and make another vertical slit so the cuts look like an upside-down U-shape.",
        "You can draw guide lines with a pencil if you have trouble determining how long to make your cuts.",
        "Avoid making your cuts any longer, or else they may be visible once you put your medal inside.",

        "Put your thumb on the front of the backing board just underneath the horizontal line you cut.",
        "Lightly push the backing board in so the flap bends backward and creates a small opening.",
        "Stop pushing the flap in when there\u2019s about a \u20442 in (1.3 cm) gap between the top of the flap and the rest of the backing board.",
        "That way, you can fit the ribbon through the opening.",
        "Avoid pushing on the flap too hard, or else it could break or it may be more difficult to bend the flap back to the original position.",
        "Slide the medal\u2019s ribbon through the flap until the medal is in position.",
        "Flatten the ribbon as best as you can so it easily fits through the hole in the backing board.",
