Use your dominant hand to twist the balloon a few times so that you create a separate balloon segment. In order to keep the balloon from untwisting, hold the two segments with one hand. Use #260 balloons, which are long balloons designed for the purpose of being made into balloon animals. These are available at party stores and costume stores. Water balloons and party balloons can't be twisted into animal shapes. You can inflate the balloons using your lungs, but it's far easier to use a small hand pump. These are available at toy stores and party stores that sell balloon supplies. You should be able to grasp the balloon firmly without it popping. Keep your fingernails and jewelry away from the surface of the balloon so they don't catch on the rubber and pop it. If the balloon seems to pop at the slightest touch, try using a higher-quality brand. Less expensive balloon brands use less rubber in their balloons, and the thinner surface area is much easier to pop."

Making a Balloon Dog Inflate the balloon and leave a 3-inch tail. Just keep blowing until the air has inflated the balloon to about three inches from the end, then stop blowing and tie off the balloon. Make three basic twists. Starting at the knotted end of the balloon, make three basic twists to create a total of four balloon segments. The first segment, which includes the balloon's knot, will form the dog's snout.

Hold them all in one hand to prevent them from becoming untwisted. Twist the back legs together. Fold the balloon at the twist between the two back leg segments. Grasp the segments and twist them three times at the base of the body segment. Take a look at your finished sculpture: it has a knotted nose, short ears, front legs and back legs and a tail that sticks straight up. Your work is complete. Making a Balloon Monkey Inflate the balloon and leave a 6-inch tail. Leaving a shorter tail might result in the balloon popping halfway through the sculpting process, so make sure you have plenty of uninflated balloon at the end. Tie off the balloon with a knot. Make a basic twist. Twist the balloon a few inches from the knot to create a small segment that will be the monkey's face. Hold both segments in one hand to prevent them from untwisting. Make a short fold twist. Start by making a second basic twist close to the first one so that you have a small segment in between the twists. Fold the segment so that the two twists line up. Use your free hand to grasp the folded segment and twist it three times to lock it in place. You've just made the monkey's first ear. Make another basic twist. A couple of inches from the first ear, make another basic twist to create a short segment. Hold it in one hand so that it doesn't untwist. This new short segment will be the monkey's forehead. Make another short fold twist. Start by making a second basic twist close to the first one so that you have a new small segment between the twists. Fold this segment so that the two twists line up. Use you free hand to grasp the folded segment and twist it three times to lock it in place. This is the monkey's second ear. Twist the ears together. Carefully grasp the two ears by the twists at their bases. The forehead segment will be sticking out between them. Twist the ears together three times to lock them in place. The monkey's head is now complete: it has a nose, a forehead, and two ears. Make three more basic twists. Make the first twist a few inches below the head to form the neck segment. Make two more twists lower down to form two segments that are equal in length. These will become the monkey's arms. Hold all of the segments in one hand to prevent them from untwisting. Twist the arms together. Fold the balloon at the twist between the two arm segments. Grasp the segments and twist them three times at the base of the neck segment to lock the arms and neck in place.

Leave plenty of room at the end of the balloon for the tail, which should be the longest segment of all. Twist the legs together. Fold the balloon at the twist between the two leg segments. Grasp the segments and twist them together three times at the base of the body. The body and legs are now locked in place, and the tail is hanging down from the body. Make a coconut tree trunk. Choose a balloon in a contrasting color and inflate it completely, then tie it off. There's no need to leave a tail at the end. Slide it between the monkey's arms and legs so that the monkey appears to be climbing it. Making a Balloon Swan Inflate a balloon and leave a 4-inch tail. White or black balloons both make striking swan sculptures. Fold the balloon. Create a paperclip shape with the balloon; the knotted end should be at the center of the paperclip, and the tail end should jut out from the end of the paperclip. Another way to approach this shape is to create a circle with overlapping ends, then flatten it. Make a basic twist. Grasp the folded balloon in the middle so that you're holding three parts: the top of the paperclip, the bottom of the paperclip and the knot in the center. Twist the three parts together, making sure you catch the knot in the twist. Hold the twist to make sure it doesn't come undone. You now have two loops with a long neck jutting out from the center twist. Tuck one loop into the other. Use your free hand to close one of the loops and push it up through the other one. This creates the body of the swan, with the tucked-in loop resembling folded wings and the outer loop resembling the swan's underside. Tucking in the loop also keeps the structure from coming undone. Make the head. Grasp the neck a few inches from the tail and use your hand to move some of the air into the uninflated tail part. This will cause the top of the neck to curve into the shape of the head. The remaining uninflated tail forms the swan's beak.",

        "Your work is complete.",
        "Making a Balloon Monkey Inflate the balloon and leave a 6-inch tail.",
        "Leaving a shorter tail might result in the balloon popping halfway through the sculpting process, so make sure you have plenty of uninflated balloon at the end.",

        "Make the first twist a few inches below the head to form the neck segment.",
        "Make two more twists lower down to form two segments that are equal in length.",
        "These will become the monkey's arms.",

        "Twist the arms together.",
        "Fold the balloon at the twist between the two arm segments.",
        "Grasp the segments and twist them three times at the base of the neck segment to lock the arms and neck in place.",

        "Fold the balloon at the twist between the two leg segments.",
        "Grasp the segments and twist them together three times at the base of the body.",
        "The body and legs are now locked in place, and the tail is hanging down from the body.",
        "Make a coconut tree trunk.",
        "Choose a balloon in a contrasting color and inflate it completely, then tie it off.",
        "There's no need to leave a tail at the end.",
        "Slide it between the monkey's arms and legs so that the monkey appears to be climbing it.",
        "Making a Balloon Swan Inflate a balloon and leave a 4-inch tail.",
        "White or black balloons both make striking swan sculptures.",
        "Fold the balloon.",
        "Create a paperclip shape with the balloon; the knotted end should be at the center of the paperclip, and the tail end should jut out from the end of the paperclip.",
        "Another way to approach this shape is to create a circle with overlapping ends, then flatten it.",
        "Make a basic twist.",
        "Grasp the folded balloon in the middle so that you're holding three parts: the top of the paperclip, the bottom of the paperclip and the knot in the center.",
        "Twist the three parts together, making sure you catch the knot in the twist.",
        "Hold the twist to make sure it doesn't come undone.",
        "You now have two loops with a long neck jutting out from the center twist.",
        "Tuck one loop into the other.",
        "Use your free hand to close one of the loops and push it up through the other one.",
        "This creates the body of the swan, with the tucked-in loop resembling folded wings and the outer loop resembling the swan's underside.",
        "Tucking in the loop also keeps the structure from coming undone.",
        "Make the head.",
        "Grasp the neck a few inches from the tail and use your hand to move some of the air into the uninflated tail part.",
        "This will cause the top of the neck to curve into the shape of the head.",
        "The remaining uninflated tail forms the swan's beak."
