For a professional artist it might be whatever gets the job done, whether it is copying, tracing, free hand, whatever."

For quick, more free-form drawing one might try to use very large paper, chalk or high number soft lead pencil and draw using the whole arm and even body in broad sweeping motions. The idea here is to feel the subject of the drawing, attempt to capture that feeling, as a more sweeping essence of lines."

One can attempt to duplicate photographic likeness, or can make one's own interpretation by subtracting or adding. One can shade with large block of charcoal used at different angles or broad pencil scribbling."

One can also try to draw not from an external subject, but by attempting to bring a subject up out of the subconscious, as complete made-up fantasy as sometimes self-psychological-insights, or some combination thereof."
