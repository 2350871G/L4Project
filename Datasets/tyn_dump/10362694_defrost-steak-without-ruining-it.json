Thicker cuts may require even longer (up to 30 hours, in some cases), since it takes longer for them to thaw in the center. Defrosting steaks in the refrigerator is a somewhat slow process, but it will help them thaw more evenly. Make a note of the exact time that you place your steaks in the refrigerator. A good rule of thumb is to throw them on the grill no earlier than 12 hours after the time you took them out of the freezer the previous day. Never let your steaks sit out at room temperature. Doing so could give harmful bacteria a chance to move in."

If you need more assurance that your steaks are a safe cooking temperature, you can temp them by sticking a meat thermometer into the thickest part of one of the cuts. As long as you get a reading lower than 40 \u00b0F (4 \u00b0C), they're good to go. If your steaks have an internal temperature warmer than 40 \u00b0F (4 \u00b0C), it may be a good idea to throw them out (and check to make sure your fridge is working properly)."
