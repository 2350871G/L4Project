So be sure at every stage of the fitting process to wear your ski socks. It\u2019s best to wear thin wool socks when skiing. These will keep your feet warm, but still allow you to feel the sole of your boot as you ski. Make an outline of your foot on a piece of paper. Asking someone to help you with this will yield a more accurate outline, but you can also do it by yourself. While standing on a blank piece of paper, trace the edge of your foot all the way around with a pencil or pen. Find a ruler or tape measure with centimeter markings. Ski boots use a sizing system referred to as \u201cmondo,\u201d which translates to \u201cworld.\u201d This universal system, based on centimeters, eliminates the need to convert sizes between U.S., E.U., etc. If you don't have anything that measures in centimeters, you can measure in inches and then convert.

Look online for a sizing chart that compares your foot length to its width and then classifies it as narrow, medium, or wide. Trying on Ski Boots Place your foot into the boot. Stomp down with your heel two or three times into the ground. This helps adjust your foot to the proper placement inside the boot. Avoid doing this on any flooring you don't want damaged, since the boot could ding or scratch wooden floors. Fasten the buckles on the boot. Most models will have these at the front and sides, though some children\u2019s models have them at the back. Buckle them to whatever tightness feels snug but not uncomfortable.

Take the liner out of the boot and stand with your toes pushed forward until they touch the front of the boot. You should be able to fit 1-2 fingers in between your heel and the back of the shell. Getting a Feel for the Fit Stand in a ski-tuck position. Bend your legs at the knees as you would if you were skiing downhill. Feel the placement of your toes and heels. In this position your heels should not lift off the sole and your toes should just barely pull back from brushing the front of the boot. Spend at least 20 minutes in the boots. Walk around in them and get a feel for any areas where the boot is too tight or is rubbing your foot uncomfortably. The longer you spend in them now, the better sense you will get for how they\u2019ll feel on your feet for hours on the slopes. Try a size up and a size down. If you\u2019re trying on boots in a store, it may be helpful to test out other sizes, just to be sure you like the fit of the boot you\u2019ve chosen.
