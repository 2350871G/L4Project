You'll find it easier to make a lei from medium-sized flowers with sturdy stems and durable petals. Flowers with delicate petals that fall off or bruise easily are not a good choice. To make one, single-strand 40\" lei you will need approximately 50 blossoms. Try to pick each flower at the base of its stem to make sure the stamen remains intact."

Make sure to leave 4 or 5 inches of string hanging below the knot \u2014 this will be necessary to tie the lei once it's finished,\nIn Hawaii, they use a 12'' to 18'' steel lei needle to string the flowers \u2014 so if you can get your hands on one of these, that's great.

Which method you choose will depend on the type of flower you're working with.

You can have all of the flowers facing the same direction, or alternate for added texture. Some lei-makers prefer to slide blossoms to the end in groups of five or so, which accelerates the process but can cause wear and tear on the flowers if you're not careful. If you're working with different colored flowers, it's a good idea to separate them out into different bundles \u2014 this will allow you to work more quickly and avoid mixing up the order of the colors. Continue adding flowers until the lei is approximately 40\" in length. Hold it up around your neck in front of a mirror to ensure that you're happy with the number and placement of the flowers."

Leave the hanging ends of your knot in place until just before you present the lei \u2013 this way you can hold it by these strings and avoid touching the flowers. Cut off the excess string and, if you like, add some curling ribbon for extra adornment. Now your lei is ready to be presented to its recipient! A lei can be worn more than once. Store it in a plastic bag in the refrigerator between uses to keep it fresh. Mist lightly with water to keep it hydrated."

Doubled over, this allows for a 40-inch lei with 5 inches at each end for tying together when you are finished. Thread the needle. Take a large needle and thread the length of string through the eye, until it is doubled over.

You will also need a needle and thread and a pair of scissors. Fold the crepe paper. Take one strip of crepe paper and fold it, accordion-style, along the entire length.

Once you have filled the thread with twisted crepe paper (this may take up to an hour, depending on how tightly packed the twists are), pass the needle through the crepe paper at the opposite end and tie a knot to close the lei. Cut off the excess string. Making a Money Lei Gather your materials. To make a money lei, you will need 50 crisp and new one dollar bills, a collection of colored beads, two 50 inch lengths of thread, a glue stick and twenty small binder clips. Fold the dollar bills. Take a dollar bill and fold it in half, right down the middle. Make sure the two edges are perfectly aligned. Set the folded bill on the table in front of you, then fold back one of the edges, just to the edge of the white margin. Flip the bill over and do the same of the other side. Continue folding each half of the bill, accordion-style, until you reach the center. Make sure each fold is the same size and that you press it firmly to get a crisp edge. Make the flowers. Once you have finished the accordion folding, the dollar bill should look like a single, rectangular strip. Fold the strip in half, down the middle. Open the folded strip so it forms a \"V\" shape.
