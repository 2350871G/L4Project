Making a basic sauce is easy since you can simply melt a little butter and dunk the crab meat into it. Try melting 0.5 cups (113 g) of butter in a saucepan on the stove. If you wish to add more flavor to it, add 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of lemon juice and 2 teaspoons (6.56 g) of garlic powder. Then, drizzle it onto the meat or dip the meat into it after removing it from the shells. Making a sauce is optional and the crab legs will taste fine on their own as well. Baking Crab Legs in an Oven Preheat your oven to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C). Let the oven warm up while you prepare the crab legs. Give it at least 5 to 10 minutes to reach full temperature. Meanwhile, keep the door shut until you\u2019re ready to put the crab legs in the oven. Be careful about using different temperatures. It will effect how long the crab legs take to cook. High heat settings could also cause the meat to dry out. Spread the crab legs in a single layer on a shallow cooking sheet. Pick a baking or cookie sheet with plenty of room to fit the crab legs. Don\u2019t use one with high sides, since that could cause the crab legs to cook unevenly. Lay the crab legs flat over the sheet. You can usually fit up to 2 lb (0.91 kg) on one sheet.\u2019\nIf you can\u2019t fit all of the crab legs, split them into batches or use multiple sheets. Don\u2019t try stacking them. They won\u2019t cook at the same rate. Boil about 0.5 cups (120 mL) of water and pour it onto the sheet. Try warming the water up in a microwave or kettle. Be careful when pouring it to avoid burns. Pour it directly onto the baking sheet so it covers the bottom by about 0.125 in (0.32 cm). You may need to use more or less water depending on the sheet\u2019s size. Wear rubber kitchen gloves to avoid the possibility of coming into contact with scalding water. The water isn\u2019t strictly necessary, but it\u2019s useful for keeping the crab legs moist while they bake. Without the water, the meat could turn out dry and rubbery. Mix lemon juice, garlic, and other herbs to add to the crab legs. The main advantage of baking is getting to cook the crab legs with all sorts of other ingredients. For a simple recipe, try pouring 0.25 cups (59 mL) of lemon juice into a separate bowl. Mix in 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of olive oil, \u00be of a cup (170.1 g) of butter, 3 cloves of garlic, and 1 teaspoon (0.54 g) of parsley. You can customize the flavor mixture any way you want. For example, you could add ingredients like salt, cajun seasoning, or other herbs like dill. If you like the crab legs plain, you don\u2019t have to add anything at all. Brush or pour seasonings onto the crab legs if you are using any. Use a kitchen brush to coat all of the crab legs with a consistent layer of the seasoning mixture. If you don\u2019t have a brush, pour the mixture onto the baking sheet. Try to distribute it evenly over all of the crab legs. Consider saving half of a butter sauce mixture to eat with the crab legs after they finish cooking. You don\u2019t have to do this, but it\u2019s a way to give the crab more flavor. Cover the crab legs with a layer of aluminum foil. Use the foil as a way to seal in the moisture and flavors. Cover the entire sheet, taking care to tuck the edges of the foil over its sides. When you move the sheet to the oven, watch out so the ingredients don\u2019t spill out the sides. Cook the crab in the oven for about 15 minutes. Set your timer and wait. Then, lift the foil to check on the crab legs. They turn a bright red color as they cook. You can touch them to see if they feel warm all over. You will also be able to detect a strong crab smell in your kitchen. Keep in mind that the cooking time will vary depending on your oven and the heat setting used. Using a Grill Preheat the grill to about 325 \u00b0F (163 \u00b0C). Use the  medium-low setting if your grill has it. Then, wait about 15 minutes for the grill to reach full temperature. While it\u2019s heating up, prepare the crab legs. If your grill has a limited temperature range, using a medium setting is fine. Remember to watch the crab legs carefully to ensure they don\u2019t overcook. Brush the crab legs with oil if you will place them directly on the grill. Pour about 0.25 cups (59 mL) of olive oil into a bowl. Using a kitchen brush, cover all of the crab legs in the oil. The oil will prevent them from sticking to the grill. If you don\u2019t have a brush, you can rub the oil onto the crab legs by hand. Another option is to roll them in the oil. You could also wrap the crab legs in aluminum foil. It\u2019s safe to use on the grill and will prevent them from sticking. If you plan on seasoning the crab legs before cooking them, use foil instead of oil. Wrap the crab legs in foil if you plan on seasoning them. Lay 4 sheets of aluminum foil on a countertop. Spread the crab legs out evenly between them. You can generally fit as much as 3.5 lb (1.6 kg) king crab legs, so get more foil if you wish to make more than that. Set aside another 4 sheets of foil to wrap up the crab legs. The foil isn't necessary if you plan on cooking the crab legs plain. Simply coat them in oil to prevent them from sticking to the grill. Coat the crab legs with butter and seasonings for additional flavor. For example, take about \u00bc of a cup (55 g) of butter. Rub it over each of the crab legs by hand. Then, cut a lemon into quarters and squeeze them onto the crab legs. For additional flavor, chop up 5 cloves of garlic and sprinkle them over the crab legs. Add \u00bd of a cup (2.5 g) of parsley, 1 teaspoon (5.69 g) of sea salt, and 1 teaspoon (2.33 g) of black pepper as well. You can also melt some butter to pour over the crab legs once you\u2019re done grilling them. Cook the crab legs on the grill for about 5 minutes. Place the crab legs closer to the side of the grill, away from the coals or direct heat, to prevent them from overcooking. Keep them about 5 in (13 cm) away from the heat. Then, close the grill top and leave the crab legs undisturbed. If you\u2019re cooking the crab legs in foil, be sure to wrap them up tightly to lock in any added seasonings. Butter and other ingredients won\u2019t do you any good if they leak out! Flip the crab legs and cook them for up to 5 minutes. Use a pair of tongs to turn them over, keeping them in the same spot on the grill. Close the top again when you\u2019re done. When the crab legs are done, they will be bright red and have a strong smell. They will also be consistently warm all over. Note that the cooking time can vary a lot depending on your grill and the heat setting used. All grills cook food at a different rate. Keep an eye on the crab legs to prevent them from burning. Boiling Crab Legs in Water Fill a large stockpot half-full with cold water. The amount of water you need will depend on the stockpot you\u2019re using. A basic stockpot takes about 24 cups (5,700 mL) of water, but adjust the amount as needed. This will be enough to cook about 4 lb (1.8 kg) of king crab legs. Make sure the crab legs are completely submerged in the water or else they may not cook evenly. If your stock pot is too small, cook the crab legs in batches or use multiple pots. Salt and season the water if you wish to flavor the crab legs. For example, start with 1 tablespoon (17.06 g) of salt and stir it into the pot of water. Then, mix in 2 tablespoons (34.12 g) of store-bought seafood seasoning. You could mix in herbs like parsley and dill, put garlic and lemons in the pot, or customize the flavor however you wish. The salt is useful for seasoning the crab legs and getting them to cook at a more uniform rate. Even if you don\u2019t plan on adding anything else, the salt is worth adding. Turn the heat up high until the water begins to boil. Set your stove to a high setting and wait. Watch for the water to bubble at a consistent rate. It will take a little bit of time, so don\u2019t rush to turn down the heat. The water has to be boiling before you put the crab legs into the pot. If it isn\u2019t boiling, you will have a much harder time determining when the crab legs are done cooking. Submerge the crab legs in the water. Drop the crab legs into the water, taking care to avoid splashes from the hot water. Use tongs to push the crab legs down and tuck them into the water as much as possible. Try to keep them completely covered by the water before letting them cook. Any parts that are out of the water won\u2019t get cooked. If you want the legs to cook at the same rate, keep them submerged. If you can\u2019t fit all of the legs into the pot, save some of them to cook later. Reduce the heat to medium and wait for the water to boil again. Adding the crab legs reduces the water temperature, so it won\u2019t be bubbling anymore. Wait a couple of minutes until it begins to bubble rapidly again. Once it reaches that point, it will quickly cook the crab legs at an even rate. Plan on simmering the crab legs until they\u2019re done. Check the water for tiny, consistent bubbles and wisps of steam. Start the timer once the water reaches that point. Boil the crab legs for 5 to 7 minutes until they are heated through. Leave the pot uncovered and watch as the crab legs change color. They will turn a consistent shade of red as they fill your kitchen with a delicious smell. Once they look done, use tongs to pull them out of the water. Put them on a plate to eat warm. Try serving the warm crab legs with melted butter and lemon juice. You could also enjoy them plain if you wish.",
