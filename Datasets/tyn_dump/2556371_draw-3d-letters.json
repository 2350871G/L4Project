    "text": " Digital Method Open your graphic designing program and type in your desired \"Text\" using the Text box. 3D will be used as the \"Text\" for this example. Transform the text. Skew, rotate or distort the text to whatever your design needs. Define the front. You will be making copies of the original text so you need to define it by giving it a different color. Duplicate the black text. Keep duplicating the shadow text until you reach the front. Refine the edges to smooth out some jagged edges from the text.  Add some finishing touches to the piece like some highlights or some shadows.  Traditional Method Sketch the text lightly using a pencil. Don't worry if it's a bit messy as you will ink it later on. Don't forget to add boldness to each letter as you need it to convey shadows. Add depth to the sketch. The trick is to copy the contours of the text/ letters and there you have it, depth! Ink the drawing and erase the sketch.  Fill in some colors. The top part should be a lighter color while the depth should be darker. Add some finishing touches to the piece like some highlights or some shadows.  A Draw simple sticks of the letter A as the main guideline for the bubble letter A.  Using the letter A guideline, draw an outline sketch of letter A. Simply draw a very light line that will look like it is covering the letter. If you want it thicker, show more space on the inner part of the bubble letter A. Fill in the basic color. Pick your favorite color and fill it in the bubble letter A outline. Add the highlights. Now, use lighter shade of the color you chose to show the highlight. This shows the 3d effect on the letters. Light and shade is very important in showing the 3D effect on any drawing. B Use the same outline sketching for the letter B. Basically, we will be doing the same techniques for the entire alphabet. Fill in the basic color for the letter B.  Add the shadow with darker tones of color.  Add lighter tone of color, and smudge the areas of the highlight and shadow to show the 3D effect.  C Draw the simple stick line figure of the letter C.  Add the bubble outline sketch for the letter C.  Erase the stick figure for the letter C and fill in the basic color.  Add the darker and lighter tone, and smudge the colors to show the highlight and shadows for the 3D effect.  D Draw the outline sketches for letter D bubble letter.  Fill in the colors.  Smudge the colors to show the 3D effect. Make sure that you are consistent with the light and shade effect. That helps a lot in showing the 3D effect. E Draw the outline sketches for the bubble letter E.  Fill in the basic color.  Add the light and shade effect for bubble letter E.  F Draw the outline sketched for bubble letter F.  Add the colors which can also be used for the light and shade effect.  Smudge the colors to show the 3D effect.  G Do the same techniques with the bubble letter G.  Add the light and shade, then smudge the colors to show the 3D effect.  H Draw the stick figure for letter H.  Fill in the colors.  Smudge the colors to show the 3D effect.  I Draw the stick figure on the letter I.  Add the outline sketch for the bubble letter I.  Fill in the basic color.  Add the light and shade color, then smudge the colors to show the 3D effect of the letter I.  J Draw the stick figure for the letter J.  Add the outline for the letter I bubble letter figure.  Fill in the basic color.  Add the light and shade colors, then smudge the colors to show the 3D effect of the bubble letter J.  K Draw the stick figure for the letter K.  Add the outlines for the bubble on the letter K.  Fill in the basic color.  Add the highlight and shadows.  L Draw the stick figure for the letter L.  Add the outline sketch for the bubble letter L.  Fill in the color, the shadows and the highlights.  Blend the colors to show the 3D effect.  M Draw the stick figure of the letter M.  Add the outline sketches for the bubble letter M.

Z Draw the stick figure of the letter Z.  Add the outline sketches for the bubble letter Z.  Fill in the basic color for letter Z bubble letter.  Add the highlight and shadows for the 3D effect on the letter Z bubble letter.  SHADOW EFFECT Gather all the 3D bubble letters that you have done.  Add more shadow effect to show that there is only one source of light. Lighting effect is very important in drawing any 3D objects. So make sure that everything is synchronized with the light source. Finish the effect by adding the cast shadow. If the light source is coming from the upper areas, the shadows should be shown on the areas that are against the light.",
