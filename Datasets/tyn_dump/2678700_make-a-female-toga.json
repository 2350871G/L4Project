You don't have to tie the cording exactly like this, but the crisscross will create a nice effect. Choose a rope that is about the thickness of a pen or pencil. You can also use leather cording instead. If you don't want to wear a belt with your toga, use safety pins to secure the under layer of fabric to the outer. Do this on the left and right side.

        "Make sure that both of the knot's tails are out of sight.",
        "If you can\u2019t hide the knot, undo it, then tie it lower on the left corner.",
        "Tie a belt or cord around your waist to cinch and secure the toga.",
        "A leather or gold cord  will work great here, but you can use a simple gold or leather belt too.",
        "If you're using the cord, wrap it a few times around your waist so that it crisscrosses and makes an X.",
        "This creates a more decorative look.",
        "For a fancier touch, add a Greek or Roman-looking medallion to each shoulder.",
        "Pin them carefully through the twisted rope.",
        "Make sure that they match!",
        "Wrapping a Strapless Toga Put on a white tube top and a pair of matching white shorts.",
        "White is the most popular color for togas, but if you don't like to wear white, you could try an off-white color, such as ivory or pale gold.",
        "If you want something more striking, then maroon or green are good options too.",
        "Make sure that your bra is strapless too, otherwise you'll spoil the whole strapless look!",
        "Fold a white, solid-colored bed sheet in half widthwise.",
        "This is only if your shorts and tube top are white.",
        "If they are a different color, match the bed sheet to them instead.",
        "Make sure that the narrow edges of the bed sheet match up.",
        "If you are very tall, then you may want to fold it askew so that 1 edge is longer than the other.",
        "If the bedsheet is too narrow to wrap around your torso, fold it lengthwise.",
        "Wrap the folded edge around your torso, just under the armpits.",
        "Hold the toga behind your back, with 1 corner against your left armpit.",
        "Wrap the other corner across the front of your body.",
        "Keep wrapping until you get a snug fit.",
        "This is just like wrapping a towel around your body.",
        "Make sure that the left corner lands some place that you can easily reach and pin.",
        "If it lands on your back, adjust the right corner.",
        "The toga needs to be tight enough to hold, but loose enough so that you can still walk.",
        "Tuck the left corner under the wrapped fabric.",
        "For an additional level of security, you might want to add a safety pin.",
        "Insert the safety pin from behind the fabric so that it's not visible on the outside.",
        "Avoid pinning the toga directly to your tube top.",
        "It may sound like a good idea at first, but if your toga gets tugged down, your tube top will fall as well!",
        "Tie a belt or cord around your waist to cinch and secure the toga.",
        "A leather belt would work just fine here, but you can also use a thin leather or gold cord.",
        "If you choose the latter, consider wrapping it a few times around your waist so that it makes an X.",
        "This style is very simple and elegant.",
        "You can make it look fancier by wearing a gold necklace or collar.",
        "The lack of shoulder straps will help make it stand out!"
