        "To do this, simply lay the curved end of your tool over your nail bed at a 45-degree angle, and gently push your cuticles back to the nail bed.",
        "With a little force, your cuticles will easily move backwards so you can easily snip them off.",
        "Trim your cuticles if you want to get rid of dead skin or hang nails.",
        "Use a cuticle trimmer to cut off the cuticles after you push them back.",
        "Simply use this tool as a miniature pair of scissors to snip off the dead cuticle skin around your toes.",
        "Start at the outer edge of your cuticles, and make small snips until you remove all of the dead skin.",

        "Rub the lotion completely into the skin.",
        "Painting Your Nails Place your toes inside of toe separators so it\u2019s easy to paint them.",
        "Toe separators are pieces of plastic or foam that fit in between each of your toes.",
        "They space out your toes, so your polish will not spread as you paint them.",
        "Since you can see all of your toenail, it is easier to apply nail polish.",
        "Paint your base coat and let it dry completely.",
        "A base coat helps the polish adhere to your nail.",
        "It also creates a barrier, protecting your nails from the chemicals in the nail polish.",
        "Unscrew the top, and apply the base coat to each of your toenails.",
        "Start at the cuticle, and paint a thin strip toward the edge of your nail.",
        "Repeat until the entire nail is covered.",
        "Let the base coat dry completely, which typically takes 1-2 minutes.",
        "Applying a base coat prevents the polish color from staining your nails.",
        "Use 1-2 coats of nail polish to cover your nails.",
        "When your base coat dries, unscrew the applicator brush from your nail polish of choice, and apply the color from your cuticle to the end of your nail.",
        "Make 1-3 swipes to cover the nail.",

        "Go with a neutral shade of polish if you don\u2019t want to draw attention to your feet.",

        "MN\t\t\t\t\tMarta Nagorska\t\t\tNail Technician\t\t\t\tIf you're painting a French pedicure, start with the white polish.",
        "Then, use a round brush and clean on the inside of the nail so that your line is nice and round.",
        "Finish by applying a topcoat or a sheer pink polish so that the white is not as harsh.",
        "Apply your top coat after your main polish color dries.",
        "When you are finished painting your main nail polish color, use a top coat to seal the polish.",
        "To apply, simply paint your nails from cuticle to tip.",
        "Top coat prevents your nail polish from chipping, and it makes your polish look extra shiny and glossy.",
        "Let your nails dry completely before removing the toe separators.",
        "If you take off the separators before your nails dry, your polish may get smeared or wind up on your other toes.",
        "To prevent this, wait 1-3 minutes for your polish to dry.",
        "To check if your polish is dry, gently touch the corner of 1 nail with the tip of your finger."
