You\u2019ll want heavy duty, sharp shears and scissors that cut fabric evenly and that, when they become dull, can be taken to a machine shop and sharpened. Measuring tape and a ruler. This is one thing that sewing has in common with carpentry, always measure twice before you cut. A ruler will assist when cutting larger pieces of fabric while they are flat. The measuring tape is helpful for measuring while fitting fabric. An heavy-duty iron. All cotton fabrics should be washed before sewing to ensure shape after future washings. After washing, and iron will be needed to remove wrinkles from these fabrics. Additionally, a heavy-duty iron is helpful when creating seams for pinning. Pins and a seam ripper. Pins are needed to ensure all the layers of fabric, and possibly batting, remain stationary during sewing. A seam ripper is there for when a seams goes slightly crooked or a snarl forms in your thread while sewing. The ripper is used to gently remove the thread from the fabric so it can be resewn. Bobbins and thread. You\u2019ll want plenty of extra bobbins for when you start new projects but still have thread on the bobbins from prior projects. You\u2019ll also want thread in a variety of textures, like for clothes, or upholstery, or denim, and also a set of basic colors, too."
