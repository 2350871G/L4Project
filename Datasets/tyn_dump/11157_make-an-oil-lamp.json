Making a Wire and Jar Oil Lamp Gather your supplies. This lamp uses a jar and a bit of wire. It's great for those who have jars but either don't have the lid anymore or don't want to poke a hole in the lid. Here's a list of what you will need to make this lamp:\nSquat mason jar\n100% cotton cord or lamp wick\nOlive oil\nScissors\nFloral wire\nWire cutters Trim the wick down with a pair of scissors so that it can fit inside the jar. The thicker wick you use, the larger flame you will get. If you want something small, go for a #2 or \u00bc inch lantern wick. Cut a piece of thin wire using wire cutters. The wire needs to be long enough so that it can hook over the mouth of the jar when doubled. You will be using it to support your wick. Avoid using plastic-coated, painted, copper, or zinc/galvanized wire. Do not use scissors. Not only could you hurt yourself, but you'll also dull the scissors. Place the wick in the center of your wire and fold the wire in half. You are sandwiching the wick between the two halves of the wire. The tip of the wick should be no more than an inch (2.54 centimeters) above the lip of the wire. Gently twist the two halves of the wire together. The wire needs to be tight enough so that it can suspend the wick, but loose enough so that you can still pull the wick up and down. Position your wick over the center of the jar.

        "If you don't have a jar, you can use a pretty glass bowl instead.",
        "Fill the jar two-thirds to three-fourths of the way with olive oil.",
        "Olive oil is great to use, because it burns clean.",
        "It does not contain harmful chemicals, and it does not leave behind bad smells.",
        "If you want to save on oil, use one part water and one part oil.",
        "Place the cork on the oil.",
        "Try to float it as much in the center as you can.",
        "Wait 15 minutes before lighting the lamp.",
        "This will give the wick enough time to absorb the oil and make it easier to light.",
        "Making a Wire and Jar Oil Lamp Gather your supplies.",
        "This lamp uses a jar and a bit of wire.",
        "It's great for those who have jars but either don't have the lid anymore or don't want to poke a hole in the lid.",
        "Here's a list of what you will need to make this lamp:\nSquat mason jar\n100% cotton cord or lamp wick\nOlive oil\nScissors\nFloral wire\nWire cutters Trim the wick down with a pair of scissors so that it can fit inside the jar.",
        "The thicker wick you use, the larger flame you will get.",
        "If you want something small, go for a #2 or \u00bc inch lantern wick.",
        "Cut a piece of thin wire using wire cutters.",
        "The wire needs to be long enough so that it can hook over the mouth of the jar when doubled.",
        "You will be using it to support your wick.",
        "Avoid using plastic-coated, painted, copper, or zinc/galvanized wire.",
        "Do not use scissors.",
        "Not only could you hurt yourself, but you'll also dull the scissors.",
        "Place the wick in the center of your wire and fold the wire in half.",
        "You are sandwiching the wick between the two halves of the wire.",
        "The tip of the wick should be no more than an inch (2.54 centimeters) above the lip of the wire.",
        "Gently twist the two halves of the wire together.",
        "The wire needs to be tight enough so that it can suspend the wick, but loose enough so that you can still pull the wick up and down.",
        "Position your wick over the center of the jar.",
        "It's okay if the wick dips down a little bit into the jar.",
        "If it dips down too far into the jar, try bringing it a little bit closer to the rim.",
        "Hook the end of the wire over the lip of the jar.",
        "The wire should now be holding the wick just inside the mouth of the jar.",
        "If the wire does not hold its shape, you can try wrapping another piece of wire around the neck of the jar, securing the wick-holding-wire to the jar.",
        "Fill the jar about two-thirds to three-fourths of the way with olive oil.",
        "Olive oil is great to use because it doesn't contain dangerous chemicals.",
        "It also burns clean and doesn't stink.",
        "Wait 15 minutes before lighting your wick.",
        "This will give the wick enough time to soak up the oil and allow you to light it.",
        "Making a Lidded Jar Oil Lamp Gather your supplies.",
        "This lamp is great for patios, but it requires a little bit more work.",
        "The ending result, however, is worth it.",
        "Here's a list of what you will need:\nMason jar\nMason jar lid\n100% cotton cord or lamp wick\nOlive oil\nHammer\nScrewdriver or nail\nPliers (optional)\nTwo blocks of wood\nTape (optional)\nMetal washer or nut Place the mason jar lid upside down between two blocks of wood.",
        "If your lid comes apart, set the ring part aside and use the disk part for now.",
        "The two blocks of wood should be about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) apart.",
        "The gap should be right in the middle of the lid.",
        "Punch a hole into the jar lid.",
        "Position your nail or screwdriver right over the middle of the middle.",
        "Use your hammer to force the nail or screwdriver into the lid.",
        "Once you have poked the hole, set the hammer aside, and wiggle the nail or screwdriver out.",
        "Widen the hole, if necessary.",
        "The hole needs to be wide enough so that you can slide your cord or wick through.",
        "It needs to be tight enough so that it can support the cord or wick and hold it up over the jar.",
        "If your hole needs to be widened, you can use a pair of pliers to peel the edges of the hole towards you.",
        "Slip your wick through the hole.",
        "The tip of the wick should be now sticking up through the top of the lid.",
        "If you want, you can wrap the tip with some tape first; this will prevent the wick from unraveling as you work it through the hole.",
        "You can also use a 100% cotton cord.",
        "Consider slipping a metal nut over the wick.",
        "This will hide the hole in the jar, and make your lamp look neater.",
        "The tip of the wick should be sticking no more than 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) above the top of the nut.",
        "Make sure that the inside diameter of the nut is the same as your wick.",
        "If you used tape, be sure to snip the taped part off once you have the wick through the nut and hole.",
        "Fill the jar one-fourth to one-third of the way full with olive oil.",
        "You can also use other types of oil as well, such as citronella or lamp oil.",
        "Olive oil, however, is the safest because it does not contain any harmful chemicals.",
        "Place the lid back onto the jar and wait 10 to 15 minutes.",
        "This will allow the cord or wick to soak up enough oil so that you can light it.",
        "Customizing Your Oil Lamp Consider customizing your lantern before you add the oil in.",
        "This section will give you a few tips on how you can make your oil lamp look and smell prettier.",
        "You don't have to use all of the ideas in this section.",
        "Just choose one or two that appeal to you the most.",
        "Add a few drops of your favorite essential oil or candle fragrance into the oil lamp.",
        "This can give your lamp a more fragrant smell as it burns.",
        "If you want something calming or relaxing, consider using lavender or vanilla.",
        "If you want something refreshing, consider using lemon, lime, or orange.",
        "If you like cool, fresh scents, you might like eucalyptus, mint, or rosemary.",
        "Slip in a few sprigs of your favorite woody herb.",
        "This will not only make your jar look prettier, but the herbs will give the oil a faint fragrance as it burns.",
        "Great herbs to use include:\nRosemary\nThyme\nLavender Give your jar a burst of color with some citrus slices.",
        "Cut a lemon, lime, or orange into thin slices and slip those slices into the jar.",
        "Push them against the walls of the jar so that the center jar is mostly empty.",
        "The citrus slices will not only give your jar a burst of color, but they will also give the oil a nice smell when it burns.",
        "Match your jar to your decor by filling it with other items.",
        "Just don't get too carried away, of you won't have enough oil in the lamp for it to burn.",
        "Here are a few ideas to get you started:\nFor a nautical or beach-themed lamp, you can fill your jar with seashells and sea glass.",
        "For a festive lamp, try adding some cedar cuttings, holly berries, and small pine cones.",
        "For a more fragrant festive lamp, add in some pine sprigs and cinnamon sticks.",
        "Consider adding a few drops of food coloring if you are using water in your lamp as well.",
        "Fill your lamp part way with water and add a few drops of food coloring.",
        "Stir the water with a spoon, then add your wick and oil.",
        "The water will sink to the bottom and the oil will float on top, giving you a stripped effect."
