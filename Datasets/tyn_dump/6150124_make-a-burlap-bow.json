        "The exact number of pairs will vary based on the width of the ribbon and on your personal aesthetic taste.",
        "Larger widths may only need two to three loop sets total, but smaller widths may need twice that amount to achieve a similarly fluffy bow.",
        "Tie off the center.",
        "Carefully wrap a wire tie or piece of florist wire around the exact center of the bow to secure it.",
        "Tie the wire as tightly as possible to maintain a fixed shape, then trim any excess wire using wire cutters.",
        "You should also trim any excess burlap after tying off the center of the bow.",
        "Hide the wire tie with additional burlap.",
        "Cut another length of burlap, then wrap it around the center to hide the wire.",
        "The burlap used during this step will need to be narrower than the burlap used for the main body of the bow.",
        "You can use a different ribbon, or use the same type of ribbon and simply fold it before wrapping it.",
        "Make sure that the center ribbon overlaps and ties at the back of the bow instead of the front.",
        "Leave enough ribbon hanging down from the center to create \"tails\" beneath the bow.",
        "Fan out the loops.",
        "Twist and fluff the separate loops as needed to create the precise look you want.",
        "Since burlap is such a thick material, it will usually retain its shape regardless of whether you use wired or free-form ribbon.",
        "Cut the ribbon tails.",
        "Trim the ribbon tails to the desired length, keeping both tails equally long.",
        "If desired, you can also cut \"v\" shaped notches into the ends to help prevent the burlap from unraveling over time.",
        "Use as desired.",
        "The burlap bow should now be finished.",
        "You can use it as its own decoration or use it to accent wreaths, vases, pillows, and more.",
        "Gift Bow[4]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source\n\t\t\n[5]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source Cut seven strips of burlap.",
        "Select 1/2 to 3/4 inch (1.25 to 1.9 cm) wide burlap ribbon.",
        "Cut seven pieces of ribbon, creating three pairs of ribbon in progressively smaller lengths.",
        "Two pieces should be 10 inches (25 cm) long, two should be 9 inches (23 cm) long, and two should be 8 inches (20 cm) long.",
        "The final piece should be 4 inches (10 cm) long and should not have its own match.",
        "Loop both ends and staple them in the center.",
        "Starting with one piece of burlap, fold the end of the strip so that it sits on top of the center of the piece.",
        "Fold the other end so that it overlaps the first at this center point.",
        "With each fold, the top side of the end should meet the top side of the center, creating a pointed loop.",
        "The finished appearance should look like a figure-8.",
        "Staple the center of the figure-8 to hold it together as you continue working.",
        "Repeat with most of the remaining strips.",
        "Repeat the folding and stapling process with the other 10 inch (25 cm) strip, both 9 inch (23 cm) strips, and both 8 inch (20 cm) strips.",
        "Do not, however, loop the final 4 inch (10 cm) strip yet.",
        "Crisscross two loops.",
        "Create and \"x\" shape from the two largest loops by laying one on top of the other, angling them in perpendicular directions.",
        "Note that the narrow, pointed part of the loops should point downward when you stack them.",
        "Hold the two pieces together by placing a small dab of hot glue in between them.",
        "Stack the remaining loops in pairs.",
        "Stack the remaining four loop pairs on top of the bottom set, working with one size at a time.",
        "The loops of each evenly sized pair should form a perpendicular \"x\" shape with one another.",
        "As you stack the loops on top of one another, try to fill in the gaps left by the previous set.",
        "Once you determine the best placement for a loop, hold it in place using hot glue.",
        "Loop the final strip into a circle.",
        "Bring the ends of the 4 inch (10 cm) strip together, forming a single circular loop.",
        "Hold the ends together with a staple or a bead of hot glue.",
        "Adhere the final loop to the center.",
        "Place a bead of hot glue in the open center of your ribbon stack.",
        "Press the seam side of the final loop into the glue.",
        "Once the glue dries, fluff and readjust the secure loops as needed.",
        "Some of the outer loops should slightly overlap the center loop.",
        "Use as desired.",
        "The burlap bow should be complete.",
        "You can use it to decorate gifts and other packages."
