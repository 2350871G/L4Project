The more Plinko chips you have, the more prizes and money you can potentially win. You\u2019ll be shown items, and asked to decide if you think the price of the item starts with 1 specific digit or ends with another specific digit. Use your best judgment, as you\u2019ll earn 1 chip for every digit you guess correctly. For example, you may be shown a cooler that retails at $25 USD and asked if the price for it starts with a \u201c2\u201d or a \u201c1.\u201d If you guess \u201c2,\u201d then you\u2019ll earn a Plinko chip."
