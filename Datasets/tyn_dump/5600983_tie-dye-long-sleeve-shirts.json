Bottles are much easier to use than mixed dye, because you can apply them more exactly to sections of the shirt. If you want a rainbow tie-dye shirt, look for a kit that contains all the shirts you need. Read your tie-dye instructions to see if you need to use soda ash to fix the dye, or if it can be used without soaking. Purchase soda ash, or washing soda that is made of sodium carbonate. Purchase rubber bands. Lay a plastic drop cloth on your table. It will protect the table, but it also allows the t-shirt to be wrapped more easily. Keep a plastic bag and a bucket nearby so that you can transport your shirt to the laundry room. Wrapping Your Shirt Practice the wrapping process while the shirt is dry. Then, you can repeat with a shirt soaked in soda ash and water. Smooth out the shirt on the plastic drop cloth. Move the tips of the long sleeves so that they are gathered next to the body of the shirt. Try to keep them close if you want them to form a pattern with the rest of the shirt. Keep them separate if you want a different pattern on the sleeves than the body of the tee. Find the imaginary line that connects the two armpits through the center of the shirt. Pinch the shirt in the middle of that line, in the center of the chest. Twist the shirt. The shirt will start to form a spiral. Use your other hand to continue twisting the shirt. Feather the shirt before you finish your round spiral. This means that you will create extra lines, or folds, in the shirt between each turn. Make sure that the long sleeves travel along the length of the body as you make your spiral.  Stop when you\u2019ve made a tight spiral that is in the shape of a circle.
