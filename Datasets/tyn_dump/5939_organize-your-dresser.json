How about clothes that are ripped, stained, damaged, or torn? Go through your piles, and pick out the clothes you don't wear anymore. They are only taking up valuable space and could be put towards a better use. Here are some things you can do with the clothes you no longer wear:\nDonate the clothes that are still in good condition. You can take them to your local salvation army or homeless shelter. You can also give them away to friends or family members. Consider mending the ripped or torn clothes. Sometimes, you might come across something that you still like and would wear, if not for the horrible tear in the most embarrassing of places. Instead of tossing the garment, try mending it yourself with a needle and thread. If you are afraid to mend something, consider taking it to a professional seamstress. Keep in mind, however, that some things are beyond repair and cannot be mended. Consider dyeing stained clothes that you still like. If you can't get a stain out, you can try dyeing the garment with fabric dry. You can also try coloring the stain in with an opaque fabric marker. It is not a perfect solution, but it might make the stain less noticeable. Recycle torn, stained, and ripped clothes that are beyond repair. These types of clothes usually won't be taken by a salvation army or homeless shelter, and they are impossible to fix. Instead of throwing these clothes away, consider cutting them down. Use the stained parts as cleaning rags. Save the undamaged parts for future sewing and DIY projects."

Depending on how many drawers you have, you can devote each one to a separate garment. For example, one drawer could be just for socks, and another one just for underwear, and so forth. If your dresser does not have any small drawers, consider keeping your socks, underwear, and bras in one of the top drawers. Use a drawer divider to keep them separate. You can also store small items, such as camis, tights, underwear, and socks, in a tray that has compartments. Stick the tray in one of your larger drawers.

    "text": " Getting Started and Making Space Take everything out of your dresser. This will give you a sort of blank canvas to work on. It may also make it easier for you to figure out what you have and where to put it. You might even find something that does not belong in your dresser. Sort your clothes into different categories and place them into separate piles. This will help you figure out what you should put in which drawer. There are many different ways to sort out your clothes. It all depends on what you already own and how much space you have in your dresser. Here are some ideas to get you started:\nSort your clothes based on type, such as: pants, shirts, skirts, etc. Sort your clothes based on season, such as: summer, winter, fall, spring, warm weather, and cool weather. Sort your clothes based on occasion, such as: casual, school, work, formal, nightgowns, pajamas, and so forth. Separate the clothes you no longer wear from the ones you still wear. Are there clothes you have not worn in months or years? Is there something that no longer fits or suits your style, tastes, or interests? How about clothes that are ripped, stained, damaged, or torn? Go through your piles, and pick out the clothes you don't wear anymore. They are only taking up valuable space and could be put towards a better use. Here are some things you can do with the clothes you no longer wear:\nDonate the clothes that are still in good condition. You can take them to your local salvation army or homeless shelter. You can also give them away to friends or family members. Consider mending the ripped or torn clothes. Sometimes, you might come across something that you still like and would wear, if not for the horrible tear in the most embarrassing of places. Instead of tossing the garment, try mending it yourself with a needle and thread. If you are afraid to mend something, consider taking it to a professional seamstress. Keep in mind, however, that some things are beyond repair and cannot be mended. Consider dyeing stained clothes that you still like. If you can't get a stain out, you can try dyeing the garment with fabric dry. You can also try coloring the stain in with an opaque fabric marker. It is not a perfect solution, but it might make the stain less noticeable. Recycle torn, stained, and ripped clothes that are beyond repair. These types of clothes usually won't be taken by a salvation army or homeless shelter, and they are impossible to fix. Instead of throwing these clothes away, consider cutting them down. Use the stained parts as cleaning rags. Save the undamaged parts for future sewing and DIY projects. Fold your clothes, if necessary. This will make it easier and quicker to put them away into the dresser. Be sure to still keep them in your piles. Consider wiping the inside of each drawer clean and adding a drawer liner. If your drawer has not been organized in a while, you might notice some dust inside the drawer. This is a great change to clean out that dust. You can also insert a drawer liner at time to give the inside of your drawer a flash of color and a new look. If you want to add a drawer liner, measure the bottom of your drawer first, then cut the liner to fit. Pull the backing off by about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) and press it down against the drawer bottom. Carefully peel the backing off little by little as you continue to press the liner against the drawer. Take everything off the top of your dresser. This will give you a clean canvas to work on. If you'd like, you can place everything inside a bin or basket. This will keep everything together while you organize. Start by placing the largest items in the bin or basket first. Then, put in the smaller items. The largest items will take up the most space, and the smaller items can easily fit in between them. Consider keeping a second bin or basket handy for items that do not belong on top of your dresser. This way, once you are done organizing, you can put everything back where it belongs. Clean the top of your dresser to give it a fresh glow. Dust the top and wipe it down with a damp paper towel. You can also use a cleaning spray if your dresser is especially dusty. Organizing Inside Your Dresser Know that there are many ways to organize the inside of a dresser. This section will give you a few ideas. You don't have to do all of them. Choose the one that you think will be the easiest for you to keep organized. Know that clothes don't have to be stacked. If you have a lot of shirts, you can arrange them horizontally inside your dresser, like in a file cabinet. It is a perfect solution for those who have a ton of shirts and not enough drawer space. This will allow you to see all the shirts you have all at once.

Christel is certified in Advanced Feng Shui for Architecture, Interior Design & Landscape and has been a member of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Association of Productivity & Organizing Professionals (NAPO) for over five years. Christel Ferguson\t\t\tProfessional Organizer\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: Fold your T-shirts so that they're four to five inches long and then place them in rows like files. This way you can see them all, and you don't forget about clothing that you own. You can also color coordinate them from light to dark. Keep the socks and undergarments in the smaller drawers. Most dressers will have at least two small drawers at the top. These are perfect for small items, such as socks, underwear, and bras. Depending on how many drawers you have, you can devote each one to a separate garment. For example, one drawer could be just for socks, and another one just for underwear, and so forth. If your dresser does not have any small drawers, consider keeping your socks, underwear, and bras in one of the top drawers. Use a drawer divider to keep them separate. You can also store small items, such as camis, tights, underwear, and socks, in a tray that has compartments. Stick the tray in one of your larger drawers. This frees the smaller drawers up for other items, such as electronics, makeup, ties, and so forth. Keep the clothes you don't wear often in the bottom drawer. This can include items such as formal shirts, special occasion blouses, and out-of-season items. This drawer won't contains the same items year-round. For example, in the summertime, it may contain heavy, winter sweaters. In the wintertime, it might contain your bright summer dresses or shirts. If you have room in your closet, consider putting your out-of-season clothes onto a shelf. This will free up your bottom drawer for other items you wear more often. Try organizing your drawers based on occasion. This is a great option for those who must wear a uniform to work or school. Keep the shirts on one side and the pants/shirts/shorts on the other. If you'd like, you can also use a drawer divider to keep them separate. Consider sorting your drawers based on garment type. Put all of your shirts into one drawers and your pants into another one. You can also keep long pants on one side of the drawer and shorts or Capri's on the other. If you keep all of your shirts in one drawer, consider sorting them by color. Put all of the bluish shirts in one stack and all of the reddish shirts in another. If you have many different colors, then try sorting them into light and dark colors. Consider organizing your drawers based on season. Keep all of your warm-weather clothes in one drawer and your cool-water clothes in another one. This will make it easier to grab the most suitable shirt and pair of pants in the morning. Try sorting your clothes by color. Having separate color piles can make your dresser appear more organized and visually appealing. For example, you can put all of the white shirts in one pile, and the black shirts in another pile. If you have many different colors, try putting all of the light colors into one pile and the dark colors into another one. Add some drawer organizers or dividers to store small items or divide up larger drawers. This will help keep items from migrating from one side of the drawer to the other. It will also make your dresser drawer look more organized. You can use as many dividers as you want. If you aren't certain how many to use, start with one or two to divide your drawer up into two or four sections. Consider making your own divider. Click here to learn how to make one. Organizing the Top of Your Dresser Know that there are different ways to organize the top of your dresser. It all depends on what you have, how much space you have, and what you personally find to be the most visually pleasing. This section will give you a few ideas on how to organize the top of your dresser. You don't have to use all of them. Instead, choose a few that appeal the most to you. Drape a pretty shawl or cloth over the top of the dresser before you put anything on it. This will give the surface of your dresser some color. You can even change the shawl out to match the season or holiday. Just make sure that the edge of the cloth does not cover the drawers. Arrange the items by size for a more layered look.

It will also become more difficult to clean. Here are some ideas as to what you can put on top of your dresser to make it look less bare:\nIf you like plants, aloe plants, English ivy, peace lilies, philodendrons, and spider plants do great indoors. If you like plants but tend to forget about watering them, consider getting a pretty vase and adding some fresh, seasonal flowers into them. You can also consider using fake flowers instead; you can get some that look and feel very realistic. If you like to take care of things, consider adding a betta fish bowl.

Makeup that is tidy and well-contained can make the top of your dresser look very pretty. Here are some tips on how to better organize your makeup, perfumes, and makeup brushes more organized:\nGet a makeup organizer. If you get one made out of clear, acrylic plastic, it will be less visible against the wall. It also won't clash against your makeup and decor. Get a small, decorative tray to keep your perfumes together. Consider storing your brushes in mason jars or short, cylindrical vases. Fill the bottom half of each jar or vase with marbles or glass vase filler, then stick the brushes, handle-side-down into the jars. The marbles will keep the brushes steady and prevent them from flopping about. Keep your jewelry organized. Dresser tops are a great place to display your favorite jewelry pieces. The bright metals and gems will also catch and reflect the light, making your dresser look even prettier. You must keep your jewelry tidy, however, or your dresser top will look cluttered. Here are some tips on how to keep your jewelry organized:\nHang long necklaces from a necklace stand or necklace tree. Try to get a color that matches your dresser or room decor. Keep random bits of jewelry in a little dish or vintage tea cup. Watercolor paint palettes are great for organizing small earrings and pins. Ice cube tray are perfect for storing rings and earrings. Add container to keep small clutter together. This includes items such as cell phones, keys, wallets, and other items you carry with you on a daily basis.

Here are some ideas for what you can use to keep your small clutter together:\nA wood tray with or without compartments\nA small woven basket\nA small plastic bin\nA decorative bowl Add a container for any spare change that you might have. Even if you don't have any at the moment, it might be a good idea to have such a container there. This way, if you do come across spare change, you will have a place to keep it. Here are some ideas on what you can use:\nA piggy bank or a coin bank\nA mason jar\nA pretty bowl\nA small, decorative vase Making a Drawer Divider Gather your supplies. This divider is simple and easy to make, and even easier to use. It is a great way to divide up the clothes in your dresser. Here's a list of what you will need:\nMeasuring tape\nCardboard\nBox cutter\nMetal straight edge\nCutting mat (recommended)\nGift wrap\nScissors\nSpray adhesive Use a measuring tape to measure the inside of your drawer. You want to measure the width, depth, and height of the drawer. Write those numbers down. Draw two rectangles on a piece of cardboard. You will be cutting these out to make a cross-shaped divider. Here are the dimensions for each rectangle based on your measurements:\nThe first rectangle needs to be the same height and depth as your drawer. The second rectangle needs to be the same height and width as your drawer. Use a box cutter to cut the rectangles out. Place the cardboard on top of a cutting matt to protect your work surface. Use a box cutter to cut the rectangles out. To make a perfectly straight line, place a metal straight edge/ruler along the line you want to cut, and glide the blade alongside the straight edge. Do not use scissors to cut cardboard. They are not sharp enough and may create frayed edges. Cut two pieces out of gift wrap to cover your cardboard pieces with. Each piece of paper needs to be the same length as the cardboard rectangle, but twice the height. For example:\nIf your first piece of cardboard measures 6 inches high and 14 inches long, your first piece of paper should be 12 inches high and 14 inches long. If your second piece of cardboard measures 6 inches high and 28 inches long, your second piece of paper needs to be 12 inches high and 28 inches long. Place the smaller paper, blank side up on your work surface and spray it with spray adhesive. Spray the glue on from side to side, using light, even strokes. Try to overlap each stroke by a little to prevent any gaps. You are working with one piece of paper at a time so that the glue does not dry out. Consider working on top of some newspaper to protect your work surface. Spray both sides of the smaller cardboard rectangle with spray adhesive. This will help it stick better to the paper. Place the smaller rectangle on top of the paper. The long edge of the rectangle should line up with the bottom edge of the paper. The top half of the paper will be sticking out from behind the cardboard. Fold the top half of the paper onto the cardboard and smooth it down. Now, both sides of the cardboard should be covered with paper. Repeat the whole gluing, folding, and smoothing process for the larger piece of paper and cardboard.  Cut a notch into the center of each piece of cardboard. The notches need to go down about halfway down into the cardboard rectangle. This will allow the pieces to slot together and form a cross. Slot the two pieces of cardboard together. Form a cross with the rectangles, with the two notches facing each other. Gently push the two pieces of cardboard together. If the pieces wobble around too much, you can secure the seams with hot glue. Insert the divider into your dresser drawer. Your drawer will now have four compartments. You can fill each compartment with a different type of garment, such as camis, socks, underwear, and bras.",

        "They are not sharp enough and may create frayed edges.",
        "Cut two pieces out of gift wrap to cover your cardboard pieces with.",
        "Each piece of paper needs to be the same length as the cardboard rectangle, but twice the height.",
        "For example:\nIf your first piece of cardboard measures 6 inches high and 14 inches long, your first piece of paper should be 12 inches high and 14 inches long.",
        "If your second piece of cardboard measures 6 inches high and 28 inches long, your second piece of paper needs to be 12 inches high and 28 inches long.",
        "Place the smaller paper, blank side up on your work surface and spray it with spray adhesive.",
        "Spray the glue on from side to side, using light, even strokes.",
        "Try to overlap each stroke by a little to prevent any gaps.",

        "The long edge of the rectangle should line up with the bottom edge of the paper.",
        "The top half of the paper will be sticking out from behind the cardboard.",
        "Fold the top half of the paper onto the cardboard and smooth it down.",
        "Now, both sides of the cardboard should be covered with paper.",
        "Repeat the whole gluing, folding, and smoothing process for the larger piece of paper and cardboard.",
        "Cut a notch into the center of each piece of cardboard.",

        "Form a cross with the rectangles, with the two notches facing each other.",
        "Gently push the two pieces of cardboard together.",
