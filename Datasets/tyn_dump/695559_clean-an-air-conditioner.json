Check to see if your fan has lubrication ports. Most fans won't, but if yours do, then apply 5 drops of oil made specifically for electric motors. Avoid penetrating or all-purpose oil (such as WD-40). Lower a water hose into the empty unit. Using moderate water pressure, spray the fins from the inside out. Re-assemble the unit. Return the fan and grille to their original positions and screw them back to the unit. Disable the A/C. Go inside your house and turn your indoor thermostat from \"Cool\" to \"Off.\" Restore the power. Allow your A/C to sit idle for 24 hours. Restart the A/C. Switch the thermostat back to \"Cool\" and set the temperature of the unit so that it kicks on. Wait 10 minutes. Check for proper operation. Pull back the insulation on the pipes that come out of the base of the air compressor. One pipe should feel cold, while the other should feel warm. If the temperatures of these pipes are off, then you need your coolant levels adjusted by a professional. Clean a Room Air Conditioner Power down. Unplug your room air conditioner, or turn off the breaker to that circuit. Clean the output. Remove the rear exhaust panel and with a soft-bristled vacuum, clean the fins and coils. Check for drainage problems. Check the drain channels at the bottom of the air conditioner for clogs. Clean out any clogs with a pipe cleaner or a small bristled brush. Clean the filter.
