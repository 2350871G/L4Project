For example, if you're taking in the waist by 4 inches (10 cm), make a mark that's 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the original seam. Remember to do it on both sides of the waist."

If you want to take in more of the dress for a more snug fit, you could extend your new seam line up to the armpit of the dress.
