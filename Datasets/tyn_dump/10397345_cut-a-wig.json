        "Pin the top section of hair so you can work on the middle section first.",
        "Use another hair clip and gather the top portion of hair so just the bottom and middle sections are left hanging down.",
        "Secure the top section of hair away from the rest of the wig by clipping it down near the front of the wig.",
        "It helps to use a comb to separate the sections if you\u2019re having a hard time doing it by hand.",
        "Hold small sections of hair between your middle and index fingers.",
        "Cut sections that are 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) across at a time.",
        "Position your middle and index fingers at the length you want the first layer to be, and cut upwards at a 45-degree angle toward your fingers.",
        "Be careful to not accidentally cut your fingers during this process!",
        "Take down the top layer of hair and repeat the layering process.",
        "Again, hold small sections of the hair between your middle and index fingers, and snip off the hair at a 45-degree angle.",
        "Brush or comb out the hair as you go along if you feel that the sections are starting to get tangled together.",
        "Stand in front of the wig and let down the 2 pinned front sections.",
        "Remove the hair clips and brush out the hair on either side of the wig.",
        "Think about how you want the layers to frame your face.",
        "With layered hair, it\u2019s often the case that the front sections are shorter than the back sections.",
        "Create an outline by cutting the hair that frames the face first.",
        "With your scissors in your dominant hand, cut the sides of the front at a downward angle.",
        "Keep your elbow up in the air to help guide your hand in the right direction.",
        "A lot of people will start the framing around ear length\u2014that way the shortest sections of hair are still long enough to be styled.",
        "Layer the top and middle sections of the front parts of the wig.",
        "Similar to how you layered the back sections of the hair, cut the middle and then the top portions of the front of the wig, but cut at a downward angle rather than straight across.",
        "Section off the top portion as you work on the middle, and then end by layering the top.",
        "Remember to cut the front layers at a downward angle so that the hair will lay nicely with that front outline you created.",
        "Cutting Bangs Try the wig on and place a bobby pin in the hair at the length you like.",
        "Because your wig stand may be a different shape than your own head, it\u2019s smart to try the wig on first and determine where you want the bangs to land on your forehead.",
        "If you\u2019re not sure of which style of bangs are right for you, try uploading your picture to a website that does virtual hairstyles\u2014you can \u201ctry on\u201d several different looks to see what you like best!",
        "Set your wig on a wig stand and pin it in place.",
        "Use T-pins or sewing pins to secure your wig in the lace line and in front of the ears.",
        "You could also place a pin through the crown of the wig for a little extra security.",
        "Check that your wig stand is straight and not leaning off to one side!",
        "Brush forward the section of hair you want to use to create your bangs.",
        "Depending on what style you\u2019re going for, you may want a thicker or thinner section of hair to cut.",
        "For full-front bangs, try to use more hair.",
        "For side-swept bangs, you can get away with a thinner section.",
        "Use a comb or brush to detangle the hair thoroughly before you start cutting.",
        "Take a small section of the hair and cut upwards toward your fingers.",
        "Keep in mind where that bobby pin is, and position the wig hair between your middle and index fingers at that length.",
        "Then take your scissors and cut up at a 45-degree angle toward your fingers to create the edges of your bangs.",
        "Be careful to not accidentally snip your fingers as you cut!",
        "If you\u2019re concerned about the bangs being too short, cut slightly below the bobby-pin.",
        "Once you\u2019re done, you can put the wig on and check the length and decide if you want to go any shorter.",
        "Use a piece of an already-cut section to guide the rest of your cuts.",
        "Each time you move on to cut the next section of your bangs, bring along a little bit of a section that\u2019s already been trimmed.",
        "That way you\u2019re more likely to keep your bangs even.",
        "Take your time when creating bangs in your wig\u2014it might take a little longer, but remember that it\u2019s much harder to fix a wig than it is to fix or grow out natural hair.",
        "Comb the bangs down so you can see if they are even across.",
        "After you\u2019ve finished cutting your bangs, use a comb to brush them down into place.",
        "You could even try on the wig at this point to see if you need to adjust the length any further.",
        "Combing the bangs helps pull down any long hairs you might have missed that still need to be trimmed.",
        "Trim any long hairs you might have missed, and you\u2019re done!",
        "Use your scissors to carefully trim long, wayward pieces of hair that you missed in your initial cuts.",
        "Put the wig on to double-check the length, and you are good to go!",
        "Bangs can be super fun!",
        "You can pin or braid them back if you need to, and they can add a lot of style to your look."
