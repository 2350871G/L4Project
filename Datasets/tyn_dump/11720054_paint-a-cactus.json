    "text": " Painting a Prickly Pear Cactus in Acrylic Draw a series of connected ovals stacked vertically for your cactus. Start near the bottom of the paper or canvas and sketch in a large vertical oval shape. Taper the bottom of the oval so it\u2019s narrower than the top. Draw additional ovals that are smaller than the first one coming out of the top or sides to make it look like the cactus has more branches. Add as few or many ovals as you want depending on how full you want the cactus to appear. Put an upside-down trapezoid underneath the first oval you drew if you want to make it look like it\u2019s growing inside a pot. Gesso your work surface before drawing if you want the paint colors to stand out more. Apply a thin layer of acrylic gesso with a foam brush and let it dry for 4 hours before you start working. Apply light green and dark green paint to the sides of a flat paintbrush. Place dabs of light green and dark green next to one another on your palette. Set the end of a flat-bristle paintbrush against the paints so the bristles touch both colors. Pull the brush straight through the paints to spread them out so the colors form a gradient. Dip the brush in the paint so one corner of the bristles has light green and the other corner has dark green.You can buy acrylic paints from any art supply store or online. Avoid mixing the paints together completely, or else you won\u2019t be able to see the separate colors on your brush.Variation: You can also use a yellow paint instead of light green if you want to make the cactus look brighter. Some of the dark green will mix into the yellow to make it have a slight green tint. Fill in each of the oval shapes with a single brushstroke. Place your brush along the bottom of the largest oval shape so the dark green touches the outline and the light green is on the inside of the cactus. Slowly follow along the outline with your brush to apply the paint to the oval. Avoid lifting your brush while you\u2019re painting, or else the brushstroke will be visible. Pick your brush off the work surface when you paint completely around the oval. Continue painting the rest of the ovals the same way.The outer edges of each cactus branch will look dark green and the centers will look lighter when you finish your brushstrokes. Switch to thinner brushes as the ovals get smaller so you don\u2019t paint outside of your outlines. Be careful not to brush over areas where you already applied paint since it will make the final painting look messy. Use red or pink paint to add flower petals on the tops of the cactus. Dip a round-bristle brush in a light red or pink paint and wipe off any excess. Start the flower on top of one of the smaller cactus branches. Set the brush down on your work surface and pull it in a short oval-shaped stroke to add a petal. Add 2\u20133 more petals next to the first one to complete the flower. Add 3\u20134 random flowers on top of other branches on the cactus so they\u2019re evenly spread out.Avoid touching the green paint with your brush since you may lift it up and tinge the color of your flowers. Some cacti have yellow flowers, so can use yellow paint instead if you want. Leave the paint so it dries to the touch. Set the painting in a cool, dry area where it won\u2019t be disturbed and leave it to dry, which usually takes a few minutes but may take longer depending on how thick you applied it.

Running a fan in the same room as the painting may help it dry faster. Add short lines of grey paint randomly on the ovals for the spines. Dip a liner brush in a light grey tone so there\u2019s a thin bead of paint on the bristles. Make short, straight brushstrokes along the edges and in the middle of each cactus branch so they\u2019re in groups of 2\u20133 spines. Continue placing the groupings of spines randomly around the cactus to finish your piece.You can also use light green for the spines in the dark areas of your painting and dark green in the lighter areas. Making a Potted Barrel Cactus with Watercolor Draw a circle in the middle of watercolor paper for the cactus. Choose watercolor paper since it\u2019s the easiest to work with and won\u2019t buckle as much when you apply the paints. Lightly sketch in a circle near the center of the paper using a pencil so the cactus is the focal point of the painting. If you want the cactus to look taller, use a vertical oval shape instead of a circle. You can buy watercolor paper from an art supply or craft store. Avoid using printer paper for your painting since it will buckle or tear when it gets wet from the paint. You don\u2019t have to do any additional preparation on the surface of the watercolor paper before you start working. Add an upside-down trapezoid underneath the circle for the pot. Draw a horizontal line so it crosses through the outline on the bottom of the circle. Then sketch in lines coming down from the end of the horizontal line so they\u2019re at a 45-degree angle going toward the middle of the paper. Connect the ends of the angled lines with another shorter horizontal line to form the bottom of the pot.You don\u2019t need to include a pot on the bottom of the cactus if you don\u2019t want to. Spread water inside the outline of your drawing with a watercolor brush. Dip a watercolor paintbrush into a cup of clean water to wet the bristles. Shake off any excess water before applying it to the paper. Stay within the outlines of your drawing as you wet the paper so the colors flow more easily when you begin painting.

Apply an even layer of the color inside the outlines first, and load your brush with more paint before going over areas that you want darker.If you want the pot to look white, use light grey watercolors around the edges of the outline to make it look like there are shadows on the pot. Make curved lines inside the cactus with dark green paint to add the ribs. Dip your brush in dark green paint and shake off any excess water. Only touch the tip of the brush against the paper starting where the cactus touches the pot. Slowly pull the brush toward the top of the cactus so it follows the curve of the outline. Space the curved lines equal distances apart to create the separate ribs on the surface of the cactus.The ribs will make the cactus look more realistic, but you don\u2019t have to add them if you want a more simplistic painting. Use short strokes of beige paint to add spines along the ribs. Wet your brush with clean water and dip it in your beige paint.

Place additional groupings of spines along the rest of the ribs and along the edges of the painting.If you don\u2019t add the ribs, you can randomly place the spines inside and around the edges of the cactus. Creating a Saguaro Cactus with Oil Paint a layer of gesso on your work surface and allow it to dry for 4 hours. Stir an acrylic gesso with a stir stick to ensure it\u2019s properly mixed before using it. Dip a foam brush in the gesso and wipe off any excess. Start in the center of your work surface and spread the gesso to the edges so it creates a thin, even layer.

Add more paint if you want the color to appear more vibrant, or mix in more gesso to make the color lighter. Draw a tall cylindrical shape for the cactus trunk. Start your drawing from the bottom of your work surface and make a tall, vertical cylinder going through the middle. You can make the cactus as tall or short as you want for your painting. Give the top of the cylinder a rounded shape to give it a realistic appearance for the central trunk of your cactus. Add cylindrical branches coming out from the sides of the trunk. Choose a spot in the middle of the cylinder where you want to make a branch extend out. Make a tube shape that\u2019s narrower than your first cylinder and extends up toward the top of the painting. Sketch in the branch so it\u2019s lower than the highest point of the trunk and has a rounded top. Add 2\u20133 branches to the trunk to make your cactus look more prominent.Try to use the same number of branches on each side of the cactus to keep the composition of your painting balanced. Paint the entire cactus with green paint using a natural-bristle brush. Place a dab of green oil paint on your palette and dip a natural-bristle brush in it, making sure to wipe off any excess. Stay inside your outlines and load your brush with more paint as you start to run out.

Brush in highlights on one side of the cactus with yellow paint. Load a yellow or lighter tint of green on your brush and go over areas where you want highlights on your cactus. As you paint, the yellow or light green will mix with the original color you used to create a gradient so it looks like there\u2019s a light source shining on the cactus. Continue painting one side of the cactus with the color until you\u2019re happy with how it looks.Avoid using white for highlights since it will look unnatural on the cactus. Put in shadows on the opposite side of the cactus with dark green paint. Apply paint to your brush that\u2019s a few shades darker than the original green color you used for the cactus. Work on the side of the cactus opposite from the highlights to add your shadows. Work along the outline of the cactus so it has the darkest shade, and blend the color in as you work toward the middle. When you\u2019re finished, the cactus will have a gradient color from light to dark.Don\u2019t use black paint to add shadows since it will not blend as well with the rest of the colors. Add lines of black dots following the curves of the cactus for the spines. Dip the tip of your brush in black or dark green paint and wipe off any excess. Start near the bottom of the trunk and lightly dab the tip of the brush onto the surface to make a dot. Work your way up the cactus making a column of dots toward the top. When you reach the top, move the brush over and make additional columns of dots along the trunk and branches to represent the spines. You don\u2019t need to add spines if you don\u2019t want, but the added detail may make your painting look more realistic. Be careful not to drag your brush through the paint, or else you\u2019ll blend in the black dots with the green background and make the colors look muddy.",
