Plan to make the firecrackers outdoors so that you don't put your house at risk, and make sure children and pets are kept away from the area. Set up a workspace well away from the house, work shed, and other structures on your property. Don't work on firecrackers near trees, telephone poles, and other outdoor features. It's best to set up on a concrete patio or bare dirt. Avoid working with explosives near dry grass or other plants that could catch fire. Wear goggles to protect your eyes while working with firecracker materials."
