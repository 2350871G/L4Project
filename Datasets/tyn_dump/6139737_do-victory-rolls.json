If you don't have mousse, work with hair that hasn't been washed in a full 24 hours. The oils from your scalp should have coated your hair during this time, giving it more structure and making it easier to shape than freshly washed hair. Apply dry shampoo for the same effect. It adds texture and a coating to your hair so the bobby pins will stick. This is especially good if you have very healthy, silky hair that doesn't hold curls or bobby pins well."

The highest part of the curve should be the back center of your head, and it should be nearly high enough to reach your natural part.
