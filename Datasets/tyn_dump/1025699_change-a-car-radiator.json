This will release pressure on the cooling system and prevent vacuum lock when draining. Squeeze the radiator hoses. If you feel a crunching sensation when you squeeze the hoses you probably have rust in the cooling system. The system will need to be flushed before filling with new coolant. There are kits to do this at your local auto part store, but if you would rather, you can do it yourself. Place a drip pan under the petcock. It is imperative that you contain and control all coolant that you drain from your vehicle. Aside from being damaging to the environment, the coolant is highly toxic to humans and animals. Its sweet taste and smell make it attractive to children and pets and can result in serious injury or death. Open the petcock. You can use your hands or a pair of pliers to turn the pet cock. This will open it and allow coolant to drain into your drip pan. Flush the radiator. If you felt rust or if your coolant seems dirty, now is the appropriate time to flush your coolant. If you are unfamiliar with the procedure you can refer to Flush a Radiator. Recycle all liquids captured. Liquids from the flush will also contain coolant. These liquids are considered hazardous waste and must not be poured into the ground. Check with your local recycling and waste management facilities for disposal options.
