It is okay if the Autocad drawing is not to scale, as long as you know at least one length. Type in \"UN\" followed by the space bar to change the units. Make sure the units are architectural and the precision is 1/6\". Identify one line segment in the drawing that you know the length of. This can be a wall length or the length of a building.

Measure the length of the line segment that you chose in Step 2. Click on the line, type \"properties\" followed by the space bar in the command prompt.
