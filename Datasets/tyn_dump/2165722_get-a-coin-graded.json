But you can start right away to begin making progress and you will soon be able to roughly estimate a coin's grade. Coins in poor (P), fair (F), about good (AG), or good (G) condition generally aren't fine enough for collectors. These coins have a somewhat legible date and mint mark, but a good deal of the design is indistinguishable. However, they can be used to hold a place in a collection until a finer specimen is found. Coins graded very good (VG) show a worn design but are generally attractive and free of gouges or other mutilations. A fine (F) coin is highly legible, and the design is clear but a bit worn. These coins are attractive and desirable to collectors. A very fine (VF) coin has only light wear with a very clear mint mark, date, and design. An extremely fine (XF) coin has wear only on the high points of the design. About uncirculated (AU), uncirculated (U), choice uncirculated (CU) or gem uncirculated (GU) coins are beautiful coins that range from very little wear to completely without wear."
