        "Most include instructions for the amount of fragrance required per 1 pound (0.45 kg) of wax, which is typically 1 ounce (28 g).",
        "Reheat the wax for 2 minutes.",
        "After you add your desired fragrances and stir them in thoroughly, put the bowl of wax back into the microwave.",
        "Heat it for 2 more minutes so all of the ingredients meld together, then carefully remove the bowl of melted wax from the microwave and stir it one more time.",
        "Pouring the Melted Wax Lay down paper towels or newspaper on a flat surface.",
        "Melted wax droplets can be messy, so you need a nice work area.",
        "Be sure to have your containers, jars, and wicks ready and within reach\u2014wax droplets can dry in 1 to 2 minutes.",
        "Stick the wick into your container.",
        "If your wick has a sticker attached to the bottom, use this to adhere it to the bottom of your candle container.",
        "If not, place a dab of super glue on the bottom and attach the wick's metal tab to it.",
        "Hold the wick upwards for 2 to 3 minutes to give the glue time to set and ensure it dries in the proper position.",
        "If you'd like, you can use your melted wax to adhere the wick to the container.",
        "Take your wax mixture off the heat and cool to 266 to 284 \u00b0F (130 to 140 \u00b0C).",
        "This is the optimal temperature to pour the wax into a container.",
        "Place the small pot onto a flat surface and keep an eye on the thermometer.",
        "It should cool sufficiently in about 3 to 5 minutes.",
        "Pour the wax gently into the container while holding the wick.",
        "As you pour the pot, keep a firm hold on the wick so that it remains in the center of the container in an upright position.",
        "Leave a bit of wax in the pot for later.",
        "Don't pull on the wick too hard or you could break it from the container.",
        "Secure the wick using a writing utensil if it's swaying.",
        "If your wick is swaying in the wax and not standing up straight, place two pencils horizontally on top of the container and secure the wick in between them.",
        "The wick doesn't have to be completely secured\u2014just enough to stay in place while the wax sets.",
        "Be sure to secure your wick if it's off-center\u2014letting it set in this position means it won't burn properly.",
        "Wait for about 2 to 3 hours for the wax to set.",
        "As the wax begins to set, you will notice a sinkhole forming in the center.",
        "Once it has completely set, reheat the leftover wax and add some of it to the top of the candle\u2014just enough to fill the sinkhole.",
        "Once the hole is filled, stop pouring the wax\u2014too much will create another sinkhole.",
        "For the best wax setting, leave your candle out set overnight at room temperature.",
        "Trim your wick down to \u20444 inch (0.64 cm).",
        "Keep your wick at a manageable length so that it doesn't burn too large of a flame.",
        "Hold the wick upright with your fingers and snip it down to size using a pair of scissors.",
        "If you light your wick and the flame is bigger than 1 inch (2.5 cm), your wick is too long."
