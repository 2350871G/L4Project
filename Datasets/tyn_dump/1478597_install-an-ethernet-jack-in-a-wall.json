        "Cut the cable emerging from the outlet to a length of 6\u201312 inches (15\u201330 cm).",
        "Use a pair of wire cutters to snip off the excess cabling.",
        "Aim for a clean, 90-degree cut straight across the cable\u2019s width, and be sure to leave around \u20442\u20131 ft (15\u201330 cm) of cabling hanging out of the outlet to ensure a comfortable fit and prevent unnecessary pull.",
        "If you cut the cable too short, the resulting tension could damage the internal wiring or cause the entire cable to pull loose of the jack over time.",
        "Wiring Your Ethernet Cable Strip the outer sheathing from the last 2 inches (5.1 cm) of cable.",
        "Place the cable inside a wire stripper in the appropriate notch for its gauge size.",
        "Squeeze the handles of the tool to clamp the jaws down around the cable and cut through the sheathing, then slide off the loose sheathing while holding the cable steady.",
        "You should be able to find the exact gauge of your Ethernet cable listed somewhere on the package.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a cable stripper, you can also slice through the cable covering using a utility knife or pair of scissors.",
        "Just be careful not to sever or otherwise damage any of the wires themselves.",
        "Thread the exposed wires into the color-coded slots on the keystone connector.",
        "Most Ethernet cables contain 4 pairs of similarly colored wires.",
        "Untwist each pair to separate the individual wires, then fan them out to bring them closer to their respective slots.",
        "Align each wire with its corresponding slot and slip it down inside.",
        "Keep in mind that you\u2019ll need to do this for the end of the cable leading to your modem, as well.",
        "If you want to make things a lot easier on yourself, pick up a pre-connectorized Ethernet cable.",
        "This type of cable already comes fitted with the keystone connector ends designed to fit into your new jack, making it possible to simply plug-and-play.Tip: There are two standard configurations for wiring Ethernet cables: T568A and T568B.",
        "The layout of the wires is a little different in each of the two standards, but you can use either one as long as your wire both ends of the cable using the same standard.",
        "Force the wires down into their respective slots using a 110 punch-down tool.",
        "Align the pointed end of the tool with the top of the first slot and push straight down.",
        "As you do, the forked prongs will seat the wire snugly at the bottom of the slot, which will in turn slice through sheathing to enable conductivity.",
        "Repeat this action for each of the 7 remaining wires.",
        "Many newer punch-down tools also clip the excess wire at the edge of each slot automatically.",
        "If yours doesn\u2019t, just grab your wire cutters and trim them as close to the connector as possible.",
        "It may help to use a punch-down puck to brace the keystone connector as you work.",
        "A punch-down puck is a type of stabilizer base that holds small connector heads in place during crimping.",
        "Plug the wired connector head into the backside of the wall plate.",
        "If your keystone connector came with protective cover plates, snap them into place on the top or bottom of the connector head.",
        "Then, insert the connector into the wall plate on the side facing the interior of the wall.",
        "You\u2019ll hear a click letting you know that the connection is secure.",
        "Be sure to buy a cover designed specifically for a keystone connectors.",
        "Otherwise, your cable won\u2019t fit.",
        "If you like, you can use a cable tester to confirm that your Ethernet cable and keystone connector are wired properly before moving on.",
        "That way, you won\u2019t have to disassemble the outlet later on if you experience connectivity issues.",
        "Fasten the wall plate over the jack mounting bracket to complete installation.",
        "Slip the included installation screws into the holes at the top and bottom of the wall plate.",
        "Use a power drill or screwdriver to tighten them inside the corresponding holes in the mounting bracket.",
        "Give the wall plate a quick jostle to make sure it\u2019s secure, then connect to your computer or router to get online.Don\u2019t forget to vacuum up any loose drywall or other debris that\u2019s found its way onto the floor in front of the outlet."
