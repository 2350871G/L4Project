For the dry ingredients, you'll need:\n2 1/2 cups (312 g) all-purpose flour\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon table salt Whisk together the wet ingredients. Get out a small bowl and crack one egg into it. Add 1/2 cup (120 ml) of vegetable oil, 1 teaspoon of white vinegar, and 1/2 cup (120 ml) of water. Whisk the wet ingredients until the egg is completely blended into the liquids. If you'd prefer, you could use schmaltz instead of vegetable oil. Combine the dough into a shaggy ball. Pour the wet mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Use a rubber spatula or wooden spoon to stir the mixtures together. Put the dough onto a work surface and knead it until it forms a rough ball. You'll need to work the dough for about a minute so it comes together. Rest the dough for at least an hour.

If you'd like to make the dough in advance, chill the dough in the fridge. You can prepare it up to three days before you want to make the knishes.

To see if the potatoes are done cooking, poke one of them with a fork. If you can insert and remove the fork easily, the potatoes are done. Saute the yellow onion. Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable or olive oil and 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter in a large nonstick pan over medium heat. Peel and dice 1 small yellow onion. Add the onion to the hot pan and turn the heat to medium-low. Stir and cook the onion until it's dark golden brown and softened. You can saute the onion for 20 to 30 minutes to get a deep caramelized flavor. Mash and flavor the potato and onion filling. Scoop the caramelized onion into the mixing bowl with the potatoes. Mash the mixture until it's almost smooth. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon table salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Set the filling aside while you roll out the knish dough. Mixing the Cheese Filling Saute the shallots. Pour 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large nonstick pan over medium heat. Peel and dice enough shallots to get 1 1/2 cups (150 g) of diced shallots. Add them to the pan and stir them. Stir and saute the shallots for a few minutes and then remove them from heat. The shallots should soften and become translucent. Keep an eye on them since shallots can burn quickly. Drain the cottage cheese. Place a few layers of cheesecloth into a fine mesh strainer. Set the strainer over a sink.

        "Use one filling on each of the squares of dough.",
        "Trim the ends and twist the dough.",
        "Use a knife or bench scraper to trim off the ends of each log of filled dough.",
        "These ends are the parts that don't contain any of the fillings.",
        "Use your finger to press indentations on the log at 3 inches (7.5 cm) and 6 inches (15 cm) across.",
        "Twist the dough at these points.",
        "Twisting the dough will seal off individual knishes (kind of like how sausage links are strung together).",
        "Cut and seal each knish.",
        "Cut the dough at the twisted points so you end up with 3 segments for each log.",
        "Pinch the ends of one segment together to make a sealed bottom of one knish.",
        "Press the knish with the palm of your hand to flatten it a little.",
        "If you want, you can pinch the top ends like you did on the bottom or you can loosely fold them over the dough so they're slightly open.",
        "If you're using different fillings for half of your knishes, consider sealing the tops differently so you can tell them apart.",
        "Baking the Knishes Place the knishes on the baking sheet.",
        "Get out the baking sheet that you lined with parchment paper.",
        "Set the six knishes on the paper and ensure that they aren't touching one another.",
        "If your knishes are large and your baking pan is small, consider using two small baking sheets.",
        "Brush the knishes with an egg wash. Place 1 large egg yolk into a prep bowl and add 1 teaspoon of water.",
        "Whisk the egg yolk and water together until they're combined.",
        "Dip a pastry brush into the egg wash and brush it over the knishes on the baking sheet.",
        "The egg wash will make the knishes turn golden brown as they bake.",
        "It will also make them slightly glossy.",
        "Bake the knishes.",
        "Put the knishes in the preheated oven and bake them for 45 minutes.",
        "Check the knishes halfway through baking to ensure that they're baking evenly.",
        "If one side of the pan is browning faster, you may need to turn the tray so they bake evenly.",
        "Serve the knishes once they're warm enough to handle.",
        "Knishes are best served the same day you bake them, but you can freeze them unbaked.",
        "Put unbaked knishes into an airtight container and freeze them until you're ready to pop them in the oven.",
        "You don't need to defrost them before baking the knishes."
