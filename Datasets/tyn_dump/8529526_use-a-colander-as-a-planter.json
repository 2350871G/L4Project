Allow your colander to dry. You want to be completely certain your colander is completely dry before proceeding. Let your colander sit overnight to dry. Put it in a safe place, such as an outdoor shed with a door that closes, to prevent damage. Lining the Colander Cut out a circle of landscape fabric. Use more fabric than you think you will need. You will trim it down later. Use a pair of scissors to trim your landscape fabric into a circle. Set your colander upside on the landscape fabric. Draw a circle an inch or two bigger than the colander to cut out. The circle does not have to be perfectly round. If you can't find landscape fabric, set coffee filters inside the colander instead. Set down as many as you need to cover the inside of the colander completely. Fit the fabric inside the colander. Place the landscape fabric in your colander.

You will be filling the colander with soil and then plants, so the fabric will not be highly visible. You can also line the colander with moss, burlap, or coco fiber, if desired. Adding Your Plant Add a small amount of potting soil. Get potting soil at a greenhouse and most department stores. Add a small amount of potting soil at first, just enough to secure the landscape fabric. Place your plant or seeds in the soil. If you're transporting a plant into the colander, make sure to remove it with a spade at the roots. Then, insert the roots into the new soil. If you're planting seeds, consult their label. This should tell you how deep to plant them. Add extra soil as necessary. You want to make sure you cover the roots of a plant you transported to the colander. You also may need to add more soil to assure a seed is planted deep enough. Add extra soil as necessary to your colander. Hanging Your Colander Cut your chains. Use wire cutters to cut your chains. Cut them to the length you want. For example, cut them around a foot in length if you're going to hang your plant from a ceiling in your kitchen. Cut out three chains of equal length. It's important the chain's lengths be equal, so use a ruler. Attach three chains to your colander. Attach hooks on one end of each chain. Feed the hooks through the slots in the colander. You should have three hooks that essentially surround the colander, keeping it balanced. Keep the hooks roughly equal distances from one another. This should keep the colander steady when it's hanging. Bring the chains together using an S-hook. An S-hook is a larger hook shaped like an \"S.\" You can get one at a local department store. Hook all three chains together using the S-hook. Hang the colander where you want it. You can hang the colander off of a mantel or ceiling hook in your kitchen. You can also hang it outdoors, using hooks around your porch or railing.",
