Any other bits that find their way into the oven may interfere with the finished texture. For this recipe, you'll want to use about 1\u00bd cups (340 g, or roughly a pound) of fresh berries.

If the strawberries you\u2019re working with are particularly large, give them a half turn and slice them again to reduce them to a more manageable size. The size and shape of your dried strawberries is mostly a matter of preference.

Heaping the pieces or letting them overlap could cause them to clump and add to their overall drying time.
