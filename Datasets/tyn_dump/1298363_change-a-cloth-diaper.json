Prepare a new, clean, fresh, diaper for use, if necessary.

Babies love to wiggle and roll around on the changing table, so if you're ready to go with your diaper, you'll be able to keep them safer.

Infants don't notice (and most don't care) when you feel around the top of the diaper to take a peek. You can usually also feel whether the diaper is full from the outside, with your hand. Bring your child over to the changing area. Lay them down on the pad so that their rear end is in the pad's center. Remove and set aside the child\u2019s clothes as needed. Remove clothes that have become dirty. Work bottom to top, removing any pants and folding up any shirts/dresses if needed.

Use the Ankle Hold Technique as described to hold up the child\u2019s leg while you pull the onesie up and out of the way. Remove the waterproof/rubber pants if they're wearing some. Rubber pants help protect the child's clothes from getting soaked. They can rip rather easily at the leg seems if removed too harshly, so be gentle.

Undo the pins or snaps, or loosen the Velcro tabs. Just don't take the old diaper off just yet. Pull the diaper away from the center of the child\u2019s stomach. Lay the front of the diaper back on the changing surface so the diaper is flat. For boys, you may want to leave the diaper loosely in place until the last minute, to prevent any spray if they urinate at the wrong time.

        "Position it so that the center of the back of the diaper is about on center with the child's bottom so that the back of the diaper will reach no higher than the child\u2019s waistline.",
        "After pulling the child's legs up, you may want to fold up the old diaper so the front of the diaper is holding onto any poop that may be inside the diaper.",
        "That way, you can put one hand underneath the bundled diaper, lift and drag the diaper away.",
        "Just be careful you don't drop any mess out.",
        "For those who choose to use pre-fold diapers that have a Velcro or snap closing system, you may need to keep your hand outstretched inside the diaper until the child has been laid back down onto the surface, so the diaper doesn't fold back onto itself under the baby.",
        "Use powder or diaper cream if needed.",
        "Apply some diaper rash cream on their skin and/or place some powder down onto their cloth diaper and over their bottom to prepare the area, if they're prone to diaper rash.",
        "Securing the New Diaper Fold the diaper up and over until the diaper's top center is at the child\u2019s waistline.",
        "Hold the diaper firmly as you move it around and place it properly.",
        "Lay the dry diaper temporarily on the child\u2019s waist so that you can obtain the new pins or get ready to fix the new diaper up again.",
        "Flare out and position both sides of the back portion of the diaper a little (if this diaper is not a folded/elasticated one).",
        "The amount of diaper you flare back out at the bottom will depend on the child\u2019s weight and width of their waistline.",
        "Only flare out and work with one side of the child's diaper at a time.",
        "You can repeat this for the other side later.",
        "Secure the diaper in place with diaper-pins or Velcro.",
        "Grab any two pins that aren't in use yet and secure the diaper, reversing the pin's removal from the preparatory steps above.",
        "Insert the pin into the diaper and close the pin.",
        "Do not push each pin through all the layers of the inner diaper, so you don't risk sticking yourself and your baby.",
        "Be sure to insert the end of the pins  away  from the child\u2019s navel/belly button.",
        "Snap the diaper pins closed from both sides.",
        "Diaper pins are created with an open section in the pin-head.",
        "Push the pin around and into the head of the pin\u2019s opening, and push inwards so the pin-head is covering this end of the pin.",
        "Finishing and Cleaning Up Put on the waterproof/rubber pants if desired.",
        "If the rubber pants weren't wet when you removed them (or can be dried with a towel or paper towel easily), you can reuse the same pants.",
        "Otherwise, use another pair of rubber pants and add the older ones to the pile of clothing that needs to be washed.",
        "Dress the child.",
        "Replacing their pants and socks before folding back down their shirt.",
        "If the child was wearing a onesie and it's still dry, lower it down and re-snap the garment in place.",
        "Remove the child from the changing area so you can clean up.",
        "If there are other people who can help you, have them help watch your child and keep them busy.",
        "Clean up the changing area.",
        "Put the pile of wet clothes and dirty diaper in your hamper or diaper pail.",
        "Stow away any extra pins, the diaper rash cream, and baby powder.",
        "Dispose of any poop by cleaning the cloth diaper inside a toilet.",
        "Then roll the diaper carefully up into a ball, and bring this diaper to the laundering station for washing."
