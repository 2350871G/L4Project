Making a Tofu-Based Filling (Option 1) Preheat your oven to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C).  Put the tofu, pumpkin, sugar, salt, and spices in a blender.

You will continue baking it the rest of the way at a cooler temperature. Reduce the temperature to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) and continue baking for another 40 minutes. The pie is ready when a knife poked into the center comes out clean. Let the pie cool before serving it. If the pie is not setting, let it cool down to room temperature first, then put it into the fridge until it sets, about 3 to 4 hours. Making a Soy-Free Filling (Option 2) Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).  Put all of the ingredients into a blender or food processor. The molasses is not completely necessary, but it will give the pie a more complex flavor.
