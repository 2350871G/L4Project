    "text": " Cardboard insoles Remove the old insole from your shoe. Shake off any dirt or surface grime. Place the old insole over cardboard. The cardboard needs to be thick and preferably have a \"cushioned\" feel to it - old cartons are good. Trace the insole shape with a pencil. Once you have the shape right, you can go over the outline with a marker to make it easier to see. Cut out the insole design. Use scissors that are sharp enough to cut cardboard easily. Repeat. Make two insoles for each shoe. This will allow you to air one insole and insert the other, extending the life of both insoles. Yoga mat insoles Trace a flip flop or shoe that is your size onto the smooth side of a yoga or exercise mat. Use a mat that you no longer want; if you can't find one, look in a charity store for throwaway mats. Keep the rest of the mat in your craft cupboard for other uses. Cut out the design that you have traced.  Flip over the cut insole. Trace it again on the smooth side to create the insole for the opposite foot. Cut out this insole. Now you have both a right and a left foot insole. Trace and cut out four more for both the right and left. This means that you'll have a total of five cut-outs for each foot. Stack the cut-outs for each foot. Place the textured side up. Glue four of the layers together, using a hot glue gun. Glue a little, then press. Then glue a little more, and press. If you try to glue the whole layer at once, it'll start to dry before you push the layers together. Leave to dry completely. Once dry, you have new insoles! Self adhesive cork insoles Purchase a roll of self-adhesive cork.  Roll out a piece of the self-adhesive cork to the length of the shoe. Trace around the shoe shape onto the cork (drawing on the paper on the back is likely to be easier). Do this for both the right and left foot. Cut out the drawn shape. If you want a thicker insert, cut out two to three layers for each shoe. If you have cut out layers, press these together with care.  Line the shoe. Peel off the backing and carefully slip the insole inside the shoe. Press down to adhere. A little Zippo lighter fuel will make the gluey side slicker for easy insertion, and it dries quickly.",
