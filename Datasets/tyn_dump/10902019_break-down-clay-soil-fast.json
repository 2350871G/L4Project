The fall months are a good time to aerate your soil, as conditions tend to be drier.

You can also use a push tiller to cover more ground in less time, if you have one.Tip: Manual aeration will break up hard, compacted patches of clay soil, introduce air and other gases from the environment, and make it easier for your amendments to find their way deeper beneath the surface."
