An alternative to building a Titan Gate would be building a wonder. However, that would attract enemies even more and they would never stop attacking your wonder until it is razed. If you don't want to take the risk, remain in the classical age for a while. Build some (that doesn't mean one or two) military buildings and attempt to train an army.

You should have at least thirty for a slow, but steady resource flow (Atlanteans should have about ten regular citizens).
