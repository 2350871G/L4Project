        "This\u2019ll clean the windowsill and remove dust.",
        "Then, wash off the vinegar with a water-soaked sponge.",
        "Prep the windowsill edges with painter\u2019s tape.",
        "Place long pieces of painter\u2019s tape along the edges of the inner and outer rims of the windowsill and window paneling.",
        "Make sure the tape is placed right up against the wood, so you don\u2019t get any paint on your walls.",
        "Instead, the tape will catch any extra paint, while simultaneously making straight lines.",
        "If you don\u2019t have painter\u2019s tape, use petroleum jelly or lip balm.",
        "Just rub a cotton swab in the jelly or lip balm and trace the inner and outer corners of the windowsill.",
        "Use as many pieces of painter\u2019s tape as you need to cover the entire perimeter of the inner and outer edges.",
        "Prime the wood with wood primer.",
        "This is only necessary if you scraped the old paint off of your windowsill.",
        "Line the entirety of your windowsill with wood primer.",
        "For ultimate precision, use an angled brush to apply the wood primer.",
        "Use any medium or large sized angled brush.",
        "Let the wood primer dry.",
        "This should take around 3 hours.",
        "However, if you are in a humid or cold place, it may take longer.",
        "Also, if you applied a thick layer of wood primer, you may have to wait longer for it to dry completely.",
        "Paint the windowsill.",
        "Dip an angled paintbrush in the semi-gloss paint color of your choice.",
        "Then, paint long strokes onto your windowsill.",
        "There is no set amount of strokes you should paint, so just continue painting until the windowsill is completely covered in paint and you\u2019ve reached the color shade that you want.",
        "When painting, keep your strokes light and thin.",
        "Don\u2019t add too much paint.",
        "Doing so will make it harder to dry and easier to be bruised.",
        "Use durable paint.",
        "You don\u2019t want it to chip or fade easily!",
        "Let the paint dry completely.",
        "It will feel dry after 1 to 2 hours, but you should wait 4 hours before adding any optional extra layers of paint.",
        "After 2 weeks, your paint should be dry.",
        "However, if you live in a humid or cold place, it may take up to 30 days.",
        "Remove the painter\u2019s tape.",
        "Just pull off the tape and throw it away.",
        "If you use lip balm or petroleum jelly, take a towel or paper towel and wipe it off.",
        "Once removed, let the paint dry completely.",
        "Hanging Curtains Measure your windowsill.",
        "Use a tape measure to measure the width of your windowsill.",
        "Multiply this number by 1.5 or 2 to create a billowy and textured look with more fabric.",
        "Then, measure the length of your windowsill and add 4 in (10 cm) to the top.",
        "The extra 4 in (10 cm) takes into consideration the height of the mounting block, which should be covered by the curtains.",
        "Get your curtains and curtain rods.",
        "Pick designs and sizes that work for you and your dimensions.",
        "Decide if you want your windowsill to pop or blend in with your room decor.",
        "If you want your curtains to blend, pick a curtain color that is a few shades darker or lighter than the room color.",
        "But, if you\u2019re looking to make your windowsill pop, choose patterned or textured curtains.",
        "Use curtains that are 63 in (160 cm) long to have the cloth fall just above the windowsill.",
        "This length is great for more casual rooms, like your bedroom or the kitchen.",
        "Curtains that are 84 in (210 cm), on the other hand, will fall just under the sill.",
        "This is still a casual look, but it lengthens the appearance of the window.",
        "Longer curtain lengths, like 96 in (240 cm), will fall closer the floor.",
        "Mark your mounting brackets.",
        "You should place these 4 in (10 cm) above the top of the windowsill and 1 in (2.5 cm) to 3 in (7.6 cm) to the side.",
        "Once you\u2019ve securely placed your mounting brackets, mark the screw holes with a pencil.",
        "For extra precision, line up a carpenter's bracket with the side of the mount.",
        "Drill a pilot hole.",
        "Take a drill and carefully drill a hole where you placed the pencil mark in the mounting brackets.",
        "Be sure to drill carefully.",
        "Going to quickly can lead to you drilling a hole that\u2019s slightly off or drilling your fingers!",
        "Keep your hands out of the way and wear goggles.",
        "The drill size will vary depending on how big the anchors are that came with the curtains.",
        "Make sure that they correlate.",
        "Insert the anchor and screws.",
        "Put anchors in the holes you just drilled.",
        "Then, put the mounting brackets back in place and secure them to the wall by driving the screws into the anchors.",
        "Use the screws that came with the curtains and make sure they are tight!",
        "Slide on your curtains.",
        "Face the seam towards the back and slowly insert the curtain rod into the holes in your curtains.",
        "Once the curtains are completely on the rod, twist on the finials on both ends of the rod to secure the curtains."
