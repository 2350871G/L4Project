Latex and acrylic brush-on paints are the most common paints used for dollhouses and will likely be available in a wide variety of colors. Latex paints are commonly used in real houses and are effective for covering dollhouses as well. Acrylic brush-on paints are often used for craft projects and are also a great option for decorating your dollhouse. You can also use spray paint for this, but it\u2019s a lot harder to control, especially if you\u2019re painting small or intricate areas. It\u2019s best to use brush-on paint for this project."
