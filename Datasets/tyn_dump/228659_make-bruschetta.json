    "text": " Preparing and Grilling the Bread Preheat your oven to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C).  Slice a baguette into \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) thick slices. To get the most surface area, try to slice the bread diagonally, instead of straight down. Use a pastry brush to coat one side of each slice with olive oil. You do not need to coat both sides with olive oil. The oil will help create a \"barrier\" between the topping the bread, and prevent it from getting too soggy. Place the slices olive oil-side-down on a baking sheet. Depending on how big your baking sheet is, and how many slices you have, you may need to make several batches. Bake the slices on the top rack in your oven for 5 to 6 minutes. The rack should be about 4 to 5 inches (10.16 to 12.7 centimeters) from the heat source. When the edges turn golden brown, take them out. You can also toast them under a broiler for 3 minutes, turning once. For richer bruschetta, melt some butter in a large skillet. Heat the bread slices in the skillet on both sides until they are golden brown. Arrange the bruschetta oily-side-up on a platter. After this point, you can start preparing the traditional tomato-basil topping, or you can use a different, more unique one. Making the Tomato and Basil Topping Brown the garlic in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Begin by heating 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a small skillet, then add 5 cloves of minced garlic. Stir, and fry the two together for 1 minute. Remove the garlic when it becomes golden, but don't like it become too brown. Transfer the oil and garlic to a mixing bowl and let it cool. Make sure that the bowl is large enough to fit the rest of your ingredients. You will eventually be mixing everything in this bowl. Cut 2 pints of red grape tomatoes into halves. For a more unique and colorful bruschetta topping, use 1 pint of red grade tomatoes, and 1 pint of yellow grape tomatoes. Cut some basil into thin slices. Take a few basic leaves and stack them. Next, roll them up like a burrito and cinnamon bun. Use a sharp knife to cut the basil into thin, narrow slices. Repeat this step until you have used up all your basil leaves. Add the halved tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, basil, salt, and pepper to the mixing bowl. For a more flavorful bruschetta, add 2 tablespoons of grated parmesan cheese. Wait 1 to 2 hours. This will give the tomatoes enough time to absorb all the flavors. Spread the tomato mixture over the bruschetta just before serving. Make sure that you are spreading it on the oily side; the oil will help keep the bread from getting too soggy. You can also serve the mixture in a bowl with a spoon. This way, your guests can pick up how much they want. Making Other Toppings Prepare some toasted slices of baguette, then add your desired topping. This section will give you several different recipes for bruschetta toppings. They range from sweet to sweet n' savory, to savory. Try a simple seasoning of garlic, olive oil, and salt. Cut a clove of garlic in half, and rub it over the oily side of the toasted bread slices. Finish off with a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt and/or pepper. Use a gorgonzola-honey topping if you like the savory-sweet. Spread some gorgonzola cheese over the oily side of each bread slice. Bake, broil, or grill the bread, cheesy-side-up for a few more minutes until the cheese has melted. Transfer the bruschetta slices to a platter, and drizzle each slice with honey. Serve immediately. You will need about 8 ounces (225 grams) of gorgonzola cheese and 3 tablespoons of honey. For an added crunch, add some chopped walnuts or pecans on top. Use ricotta cheese and marmalade for another savory-sweet combination. Spread 2 tablespoons of ricotta cheese over the top of each bread slice. Add 1 tablespoon of marmalade to each slice and serve. Use a classic combination of salmon and cream cheese. Spread some cream cheese over the bread slices, then drape a slice of salmon over each one. Finish off with a sprinkle of dill. Try some prosciutto, peaches, and goat cheese for a more unique flavor. Spread some goat cheese onto the toasted bread slices. Place a slice of prosciutto over the cheese. Add two, thin peach slices. Finish off with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of sea salt. Serve immediately. If you want something zesty, give ricotta cheese and lemon a try. In a small bowl, combine 8 ounces (225 grams) of ricotta cheese and the zest of 1 lemon. Add salt and pepper to taste and spread over the toasted bread slices. Finish off with a drizzle of honey and a sprinkle of thyme. Serve while it is still warm. If you have a sweet tooth, try strawberries and sugar. Slice enough strawberries to cover the tops of the toasted bread slices. Generously sprinkle the strawberries with sugar. Turn on the broiler, and heat the bruschetta for about 2 minutes, or until the sugar caramelizes.",
