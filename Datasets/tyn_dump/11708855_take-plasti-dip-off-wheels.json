You can then use a rag to scrub the cleaner into any spots that are tough to reach. Let the cleaner soak in for another 5 to 7 minutes before attempting to spray or scrub off the remaining Plasti Dip. Scrub off the remaining Plasti Dip with a clean rag. Locate any small bits of Plasti Dip left on the rim. These spots are often difficult to reach with a pressure washer, so scrub them clean by hand. Wipe the remainder until it comes loose. Then, finish the wheel by spraying it clean once again. The WD-40 won\u2019t harm your rims, but you can wash the wheel with clean water if you wish to before moving on to the other wheels. Washing Wheels with Kerosene Pour a low-odor kerosene into a small container. Any type of kerosene will work on Plasti Dip, but using a low-odor version means you don\u2019t have to deal with a harsh smell while you\u2019re working. Select a Mason jar or another open container you can carry around. Fill it with enough kerosene to cover all of the wheels. Try using at least \u20442 cup (120 mL) to start. Paint thinners, brake cleaners, and even isopropyl alcohol can also work on Plasti Dip but tend to be less effective than kerosene. Keep the wheel on a piece of cardboard to catch some of the mess from the kerosene. If you\u2019re able to hang the wheel, you could place a bucket underneath it instead. Use an old toothbrush to apply a generous amount of kerosene. Dip the brush into the container of kerosene, then spread it onto the rim. Work from the top to the bottom part of the rim. Cover the Plasti Dip completely with kerosene. Be careful to avoid getting any of it on the rubber, since it could damage the tire. If you don\u2019t have an old toothbrush, you could use a disposable stiff-bristled, synthetic paint brush instead. Try using a 2 in (5.1 cm) brush to reach into tight areas on the wheel. Always wear rubber gloves when handling kerosene. If you get any on your skin, rinse for 15 minutes. Use scented soaps with repeated washings to eliminate the smell. Wait 6 to 8 minutes for the kerosene to soak into the Plasti Dip. Some of the Plasti Dip will probably begin dissolving while you\u2019re finishing up the coating of kerosene on the wheel. It\u2019s a good sign, but don\u2019t rush to clean off the wheel yet. Wait until the Plasti Dip is soft all over. Note any spots that don\u2019t soften. You might have missed them with the kerosene. Apply some more if those spots seem dry. Use wood paint stirrers to scrape off as much Plasti Dip as possible. Wipe the wheel lightly to avoid scratching it. As long as you\u2019re gentle, the wood sticks won\u2019t cause any lasting damage. Scrub around the entire wheel, starting at the top and working your way to the bottom. When one stirrer stops picking up Plasti Dip, switch to a fresh one to continue. You could also use a scouring pad to rub off most of the Plasti Dip. For areas that are tough to clear out by hand, such as pits from brake dust, use an old rag or brush. Apply another coating of kerosene any of the Plasti Dip remains. The initial treatment will liquefy most of the Plasti Dip, but some stubborn spots may stay stuck in place. It isn\u2019t a problem, since you can clear these spots off with another round of kerosene and scraping. Let the kerosene soak in again before attempting to scrape off the remaining Plasti Dip. Switch to a rag or brush as needed. Make sure you get the areas around the lugnuts, spokes and inner part of the rim. These spots are often easy to miss and tend to be the most resistant to treatment. Wipe the wheel dry with an old rag. Scrub the entire wheel to clear off the liquified Plasti Dip and excess kerosene. The wheel will look clean when you\u2019re finished. Note any spots that still have solid pieces of colored stains from the Plasti Dip. Treat these areas immediately with more kerosene until they look clean. Stubborn stains need to be treated with an additional coating of kerosene. Usually, one application is enough to leave rims clear of debris. Wash the wheel with a mixture of soap and water. Fill a bucket with warm water, the mix in a gentle dish soap. Use about 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of soap for every 1 gallon (3,800 mL) of water in the bucket. Then, dip a clean sponge into the water and begin scrubbing the wheel. Work from top to bottom to ensure you don\u2019t miss any spots. Go over the entire wheel to remove any remaining kerosene and Plasti Dip. This includes the tough spots, such as the inner rim and lug nuts. Rinse off the soap and water with a garden hose. Hook a garden hose to the nearest water spigot. Turn on the warm water, then give the wheel a thorough rinsing to wash off the soap and any remaining debris you may have missed. Once the wheel looks clean, you can move on to the other wheels. If you don\u2019t have a hose available, use a pressure washer. You could also scrub the wheel clean by hand using a sponge or rag and a bucket of warm water.",
