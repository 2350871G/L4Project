        "The polarity on your machine will determine if you\u2019re welding with an alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC).",
        "The DC setting on your machine will have DC negative and DC positive.",
        "DC positive provides a large amount of penetration and is the setting that you should use if you're just starting out.",
        "The AC setting is used when your power supply only has an AC output.",
        "DC negative results in less penetration and should be used on thin sheets of metal.",
        "Set the amperage on your stick welder.",
        "Take a look at the instructions or packaging of the \u201crod\u201d or electrode that you plan on using for welding.",
        "They will have a recommended amperage on them depending on what material they are made of.",
        "Use the knob on your welding machine to set the machine to the amperage that it recommends on the electrode\u2019s packaging.",
        "If the rods provide an amperage range, split the difference.",
        "For instance, if the range is 100 to 150, use 125.",
        "The most common electrodes for steel include the 6010, 6011 and 6013.",
        "Ground your welding machine to the surface you're working on.",
        "Clean the surface first to ensure there will be a strong connection.",
        "Then, take your grounding clamp and apply it to the table that you're working on.",
        "This will prevent you from getting electrocuted while you weld.",
        "Place your rod inside of the welding gun.",
        "Some stick welders will have a clamp for their welding gun while others will have a more traditional looking welding gun.",
        "Place your rod into the tip of the welding gun and tighten the tip so that the rod stays in the gun.",
        "If you have clamps, put the welding rod in between the clamps and close them.",
        "Hold your welding gun with two hands.",
        "Holding the gun with two hands will improve your precision and will help you weld straighter lines.",
        "Wrap your dominant hand over the top of the welding gun and use your other hand to support the welding gun from below.",
        "Strike your rod against the metal.",
        "Tap the tip of the rod lightly onto the metal and sparks should start to form.",
        "The rod will act a lot like a match, and friction must be present before you can strike an arc.",
        "Once you see and hear sparks, you\u2019ve successfully started your weld.",
        "Make a straight line with the rod.",
        "Slowly move down the sheet of metal with your rod.",
        "As you go along in a line, the melting metal should form a pool behind your rod.",
        "This will be the same size as the weld.",
        "A proper weld or \"bead\" will be about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) thick.",
        "Touch the metal with the rod for 1-2 seconds to tack weld.",
        "If you lift the rod off of the metal, it will stop creating sparks.",
        "You can hold the rod onto a piece of metal for 1-2 seconds to quickly create a rounded tack weld.",
        "This is useful if you need to create quick welds on certain pieces of metal.",
        "Break the slag off with a hammer.",
        "After you create your weld, metal will form over the weld like a shell.",
        "This material is called slag and is incredibly hot.",
        "Lightly tap the slag with a hammer until it comes off in sheets.",
        "Don\u2019t slam the slag with a hammer, or hot pieces of metal can come flying off of your weld.",
        "Clean off the slag with a wire brush.",
        "Use a wire brush and rub back and forth over the weld.",
        "Clean off the remaining slag and make sure there is no metal debris left on the weld."
