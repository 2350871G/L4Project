                    "description": "Squeeze 1 drop of a mild liquid dish detergent into 1  c (240 mL) of water. Stir or shake the mixture to mix the soap and water. This solution works well when your main goal is to clean dust, dirt, or grime off your orchid\u2019s leaves. If you have a hard water supply, using a water-based cleaning solution can leave mineral deposits behind on the leaves. If this is the case, try a different method to clean the leaves or make this solution using distilled water instead of tap water. Examine your orchid\u2019s leaves at least once a week for dust, mineral deposits, and signs of pests. Removing dust, mineral deposits, and other grime from the leaves lets them breathe and absorb moisture better, so your orchid will be healthier and happier with regular leaf cleanings."
