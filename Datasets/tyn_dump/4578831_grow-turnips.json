                    "description": "Turnips thrive in cooler temperatures, so you should plant them when soil temperatures are still somewhat cool. For spring turnips, sow the seeds outdoors three weeks before the last expected frost. For fall turnips, sow the seeds in midsummer, roughly two months before the first expected frost of winter. The soil temperature needs to be an average of at least 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) for the seeds to germinate, but temperatures between 50 and 70 degrees (10 and 21 degrees Celsius) Fahrenheit encourage the most rapid growth. Fall turnips are typically sweeter than spring turnips, and they are also less likely to attract root maggots."

Ideally, you should also choose a spot with naturally loose, well-draining soil. You can improve the soil conditions if necessary, but starting out with good soil conditions will make your job easier. Also keep in mind that turnips prefer soils with a pH of 6.5. Most soils will not be too acidic or too alkaline, so testing is not always necessary. If you have difficulty with your turnip crop, though, consider testing the soil pH by taking a sample to your nearest university or by purchasing a home pH testing kit from a garden nursery or home improvement store."

To prevent root maggot infestations, rotate your crops and treat the soil with a food-safe insecticide labeled for use against root maggots. Keeping the soil pH above 6.0 can prevent most problems with mildew and other fungi, like club root. Periodically test the soil pH with a pH testing kit or by taking it to a local university extension office.
