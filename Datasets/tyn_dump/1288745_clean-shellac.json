A small desk may only need 2\u20134 cups (470\u2013950 mL), while shellac floors could use a whole bucket of water. Avoid oil-based soaps that contain alcohol.

If you are cleaning shellac coated floors, you can use a classic cotton string mop for this step. Just remember to wring out the excess soapy water before you start mopping.

If your shellac surface looks shiny and new, you can stop here. If the shellac surface has visible water damage, cracks, or peeling, you will need to repair the shellac surface. Reviving Shellac Sand the cleaned shellac with fine sandpaper. Using fine sandpaper, around 320-grit, lightly sand the entire shellac surface. Move the sandpaper in a circular motion while pressing down lightly. The idea is to open up the shellac surface to prepare it for a new coat of finish. You don\u2019t need to sand off the shellac that is present, just rough it up enough so that the new finish can stick to it. Remove dust with a vacuum or rag. Thoroughly vacuum up the sanding dust. If you don\u2019t have a vacuum on hand, you can use a dry rag to wipe it away. Removing excess dust allows the fresh shellac coating to be applied evenly. Mix 4 parts denatured alcohol with 1 part dewaxed shellac flakes. In a glass jar (avoid metal and plastic), add the desired amount of dewaxed shellac flakes, then pour in the denatured alcohol. Let the mixture dissolve completely. Cap the jar and shake it often, so the shellac doesn\u2019t clump on the bottom. Wait for the flakes to completely dissolve in the alcohol. It can take a few hours for a small batch of shellac flakes to dissolve in alcohol, and up to a day for larger batches. To be safe, mix the shellac and alcohol the day before you plan on using the mixture. Combining denatured alcohol with shellac flakes creates the perfect mixture to revive your old shellac surface. The alcohol breaks down the old shellac finish, allowing it to merge with the fresh shellac. The result is a beautifully rejuvenated shellac finish. Use a paintbrush to apply the alcohol mixture over the shellac surface. Shellac dries really quickly. When you are coating the old shellac surface with this fresh mixture, try to keep the brush moving and work fast. Follow the grain and move methodically over the surface, so the shellac is applied evenly. Dip your paintbrush back into the mixture often so that it doesn\u2019t dry out.
