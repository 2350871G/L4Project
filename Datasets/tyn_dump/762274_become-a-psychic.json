Your intuition or extrasensory perception (ESP) will operate best when you are actively listening, looking, and feeling the world around you. Focus your energies with specific techniques. There are a variety of tools psychics can employ to uncover the future for themselves or others. Tarot cards can be useful for telling individual fortunes. Gazing into a crystal ball (also known as scrying) can reveal similar truths. Palmistry charts will also allow you to read the fortune of an individual using their hands. The lines of the hand contain important information about life trajectories. Stay open to the possibilities of your clairvoyance. Clairvoyant experiences might take the form of a premonition, knowledge about a particular situation or event, or the ability to see a physical aura around certain individuals.
