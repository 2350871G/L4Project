Bonding paper will be placed on the hole, and you want to put it on the inside of the material so it doesn\u2019t show when you wear it. Then, place your fabric on an ironing board. You\u2019ll need to place a sheet of parchment paper between your fabric and the ironing board, so the bonding web doesn\u2019t stick to the ironing board cover. If you don\u2019t have an ironing board, place your garment and parchment paper on another iron-safe surface, such as a table or floor lined with cloth. Never iron directly on a wood or stone surface, as the high heat can ruin their surfaces."

For example, if you\u2019re using a t-shirt, put the iron on the cotton setting. Don\u2019t move it back and forth, just set it on the fabric for a few seconds. This allows the garment to heat up and prepare for the bonding fabric. Do not leave the iron on the fabric for more than a few seconds. If you do, you may end up scorching the fabric, which can leave a burn mark that is very difficult to remove."

        "Weave stitches perpendicular to the horizontal stitches across the hole.",
        "After you have covered the entire hole, you will need to weave stitches perpendicular to the horizontal stitches.",
        "To do this, use your needle to work the thread over and under the previous stitches.",
        "This will create a net over the moth hole.",
        "Try to create the same weave tightness as the garment you are darning.",
        "For example, if you are darning a loose-knit, then the stitches will need to be somewhat spaced out.",
        "If you are darning a tight-knit, then the stitches will need to be tight.",
        "Weave the thread a few times to secure the stitching.",
        "When you\u2019re finished with your horizontal and perpendicular weaving, leave a long end on the thread.",
        "Then, weave through the clothing item a few more times to ensure that the thread stays in place when you\u2019re finished.",
        "When you turn your fabric around, the moth hole should be completely closed.",
        "Make sure the thread is secure so the stitching stays in place when you wear your item.",
        "You can also tie a knot in the last stitch to secure the thread."
