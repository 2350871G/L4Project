Then, turn the sink on as hot as it will go and let it run for a few seconds to heat up. Fill the bowl with about 1 cup (240 mL) of the hot water. The water should be very hot but not boiling. Dissolve 1 tablespoon (17 grams) of table salt in the water. Using a measuring spoon, measure out the salt and pour it into the bowl holding the hot water. Stir the water and salt with a clean toothbrush until the salt is completely dissolved. Scrub the salt solution onto the yellow bleach stain with the toothbrush. First, put a towel down to protect the surface from the hot water and any dirt on the shoes. Then, dip the toothbrush head back into the salt solution, making sure it\u2019s fully saturated. Use the bristles to scrub the salt solution vigorously on the yellow bleach stain on your white shoes. You can re-dip the toothbrush head into the solution every minute or so to re-saturate the bristles and apply more salt solution to the stain. You\u2019ll likely need to scrub for several minutes before the stain will start to fade. Let the shoes air dry for 20 minutes before scrubbing again. Once the stain has faded a bit, leave the shoes out on the towel to air dry for about 20 minutes, or until they are dry to the touch. Then, re-saturate the toothbrush and scrub the stain with the toothbrush bristles vigorously again for several more minutes. Stop scrubbing when the stain has faded as much as possible. Once the stain has faded considerably and has not gotten any lighter for several minutes, stop scrubbing and leave the shoes to dry. The stain may not ever fade completely, but it will have faded considerably and hopefully, enough that you can continue to wear your white shoes. Soaking Your Shoes in a Cream of Tartar Solution Fill a large container with 4 cups (950 mL) of very hot water. First, select a bowl, bucket, or other heat-safe container that is large enough to hold both the water and your shoes. Then, turn the sink on as hot as it will go and let it run for a few seconds to heat up. Use a measuring cup to fill the container with 4 cups (950 mL) of the hot water. The water should be very hot but not boiling. Mix 1/2 cup (110 grams) of cream of tartar into the water. Use a measuring cup to measure out the cream of tartar. Then, pour it into the hot water. Use a large spoon to mix the water and cream of tartar until they are completely combined. Cream of tartar is available at most grocery stores in small containers, so you may have to purchase multiple containers to get enough to fill \u20442 cup (120 mL).

Washing Your Shoes with Detergent and Vinegar Remove the laces from your white shoes. Shoelaces tend to get tangled and knotted when washed in the washing machine on the shoes.

If you\u2019re afraid you might lose track of the shoelaces in the wash, you can put them in a zip pillowcase or lingerie bag to keep them together. Fill a clean sink with lukewarm water. First, make sure that your sink is clean by wiping it down with a cleaning wipe and rinsing it with water.

Then, place the drain stopper in the drain to prevent the sink from draining and let the sink fill about \u00be of the way up. Mix in \u20442 tablespoon (7.4 mL) of laundry detergent. Use a measuring spoon to measure out the laundry detergent and pour it into the lukewarm water. Stir the water and detergent mixture well with your hands or a spoon until the detergent is completely mixed in and the water is sudsy. You can also mix the detergent in by pouring it under the running water while the sink is filling up. Put your shoes in the sink and scrub the stains with a toothbrush. First, place your shoes in the sudsy water to soak while you work. Then, submerge a clean toothbrush into the detergent water to wet the bristles. Use the toothbrush to scrub the bleach stains on each of the shoes for several minutes, until the yellow begins to fade. While you work on scrubbing one shoe, leave the other shoe submerged in the detergent solution to soak. Start the washing machine on a gentle cycle and let the drum fill with water. Once the yellow stains have begun to fade, remove your shoes from the detergent solution and place them into the washing machine.
