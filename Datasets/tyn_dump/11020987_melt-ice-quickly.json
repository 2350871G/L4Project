However, if ice melt is applied to a porous surface, such as brick, it will eventually lead to salt build-up in that material and structural damage down the line. The best way to avoid long-term damage to porous surfaces from the use of ice melt is to quickly remove the salt once the ice has melted. If possible, apply a sealant to any concrete surface you intend to put ice melt on. Concrete is technically porous, so the ice melt could theoretically damage it (though this usually doesn\u2019t happen).Warning: Although some commercially available ice melts will be marketed as \u201cEnvironmentally Safe,\u201d this is a tad misleading, since they still contain salt that can seep into a porous surface."
