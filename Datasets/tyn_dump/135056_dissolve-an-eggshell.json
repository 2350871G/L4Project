The drinking glass needs to be large enough for the egg to touch the bottom without touching the sides of the glass. You can also use a plastic cup or container to hold the egg, but clear containers allow you to observe the experiment over time. Use a fresh egg because an older egg will float in the liquid. Before you begin, examine your uncooked egg for cracks."
