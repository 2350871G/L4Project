As you get more comfortable painting with the airbrush, you can adjust the pressure to get different results. Higher pressure is less likely to clog the airbrush and forms tiny droplets, but the paint dries quickly and there\u2019s more overspray. Lower pressure lets you paint fine details and uses less paint, but it\u2019s more likely to clog and the paint texture will look rougher."

        "If you want to save your cleaning solution, you can dilute it with equal parts water.",
        "Loosen paint in the airbrush cup with a cotton swab or paintbrush.",
