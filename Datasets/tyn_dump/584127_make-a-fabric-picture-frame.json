This is especially useful for dark frames (since the color might show through light fabrics) and intricate frame profiles (i.e. frames with deep curves and grooves). If you\u2019re covering a deep frame, add some additional length to this measurement. The batting should be at least 1 in (2.5 cm) longer on each side than the depth of your frame.

You may need to push it in firmly to compress the batting around the opening. Then place the picture in the frame opening and replace the back panel to hold everything in position. If your frame didn\u2019t come with a back panel, you can staple a rectangle of fabric around the back of the frame. Fold the edges in to cover up the raw edges and get a clean finish. If you do this, make sure you\u2019ve either taped or stapled your picture in place. Or insert a piece of cardboard to prevent it from shifting around. Making a Fabric-Covered Cardboard Frame Place your picture onto a piece of cardboard and trace its outline. Center your picture on a piece of cardboard that will serve as your frame. Hold the picture in place and use a pencil to trace around all 4 edges. If you prefer, you can measure out the length and width of your picture and then draw this onto the cardboard. Stiff, corrugated cardboard will work the best, although you can use a thinner cardboard for a lightweight frame. Styrofoam is another option. Use a ruler to measure and draw the outside edge of the frame. Based on the size and shape of your picture, you can create a thin or wide frame. You\u2019ll mark the outline of the frame by drawing a pencil line parallel to each of the 4 sides of your picture-shaped rectangle. Use a ruler to draw a few dots along each side to indicate the distance from the picture-shaped rectangle. Then line the ruler up with these dots and connect them with a straight line. If you want a 1 in (2.5 cm) wide frame, draw your border 1 in (2.5 cm) out from each of the 4 sides of your photo-shaped rectangle. Draw a slightly smaller rectangle inside the picture-sized rectangle. Measure \u20444 in (0.64 cm) in from all 4 sides of the lines you traced in the first step. Draw lines that are parallel to your original rectangle to create a new inner rectangle. It should be centered on the original rectangle and slightly smaller than your picture. If you cut the frame opening to the exact size of your picture, the picture will fall out! By adding a lip to your frame, you\u2019ll keep the picture in place. Cut along the innermost and outermost lines. If it helps, you can erase the lines you drew when tracing your photo. Then use a pair of scissors or a blade to cut along the inside rectangle (which you drew in the previous step) and the outside border of your frame. Now you have the foundation for the front of your picture frame! It can be tricky to cut the inside corners, but it\u2019s ok if they don\u2019t look flawless. You\u2019ll be covering them up with fabric anyway! Cut a second piece of cardboard the same size as the open frame. This will serve as the back panel for your frame. Trace the frame, or mark out its dimensions onto another piece of cardboard, and cut it out with scissors. You can use the same cardboard, but a lighter-weight version would also be fine if you\u2019ve used corrugated cardboard for the front. Or, if you\u2019ve used lightweight cardboard for the front, you can use corrugated cardboard for the back to provide some support. Place the open frame onto your piece of fabric. With the wrong side of the fabric facing up, place the front frame piece down onto the fabric. Center it as best you can. Draw an \u201cX\u201d in the center of the fabric and cut along these lines. Use a pencil to draw an \u201cX\u201d inside the frame opening, extending from one corner of the frame opening to the other. Stop cutting approximately \u20444 in (0.64 cm) before you reach the end of each line, to avoid seeing frayed edges on your finished frame. One line of your \u201cX\u201d should connect the top-left corner of the opening to the bottom-right corner, while the other connects the top-right corner to the bottom-left. Once you cut along the lines, you\u2019ll have 4 triangular flaps of fabric. Wrap each of the flaps around the frame opening and glue them in place. Place the frame front back onto the fabric, centering it on the \u201cX\u201d you just cut. Apply a line of craft glue or hot glue to the cardboard, around the frame opening. Then draw each of the flaps of fabric up and around the inside of the frame opening, pressing them into the glue. Allow the glue to set for a few minutes before continuing. Glue the fabric down around the corners of the frame. To get mitered corners, start by applying a dot of glue at each of the corners of the frame. Then fold the corner of the fabric over the corner of the frame, with the fabric corners pointing towards the center of the frame. Trim away any excess fabric at the corners once the glue has set. Fold and glue the fabric around the outside edges of the frame. Once the corners are covered, add a line of glue around the perimeter of the frame, just in from the outside edge of the cardboard. Wrap the outside edges of the fabric around the cardboard and press them into the glue. Allow the glue to dry and trim away extra fabric. Insert the picture and use the large piece of cardboard as the frame backing. With your frame front complete, you can place your picture into the opening. Apply a line of glue around the edge of the frame backing and press it onto the back side of the frame, sandwiching the photo in place. If you want, trim the cardboard down to be slightly smaller than the frame. Otherwise the edges will line up. Glue a folded piece of cardboard to the back panel as a frame stand. If you want your frame to stand up, use a leftover piece of stiff cardboard as the frame stand. Cut a rectangle the same height as your frame, and fold down the top by \u20444 to \u20442 in (0.64 to 1.27 cm). Then apply glue to this folded piece and stick it onto the back of the frame. Allow the glue to dry completely before standing up your frame. Framing a Fabric Panel Get a frame and a piece of fabric that you want to display. You can use an old or thrifted frame, or a brand new one. Choose a non-stretch woven fabric in the print of your choice. The fabric should be slightly larger than the frame itself. Pick a frame that comes with turn buttons or tabs on the back. Turn buttons are those little swiveling pieces that hold the backing in place. Take the glass panel out of the frame carefully. Remove the frame backing as well as any other contents. Then remove the glass panel. You won\u2019t be using the glass for this project. Store the glass panel in a safe place or carefully discard it in the recycling bin. Paint the frame, if desired. If you\u2019re using a thrifted frame, or a plain wood frame, this is a great way to add a splash of color. Then use acrylic paint and a paintbrush or roller to apply a base coat of your chosen color. Let this layer dry before adding 1 or 2 additional coats. Clean off the frame and sand it down to remove any varnish, if needed, before applying the paint. Allow the paint to dry completely before you insert the fabric. Cut a panel of stiff cardboard or plywood to fit within the frame\u2019s opening. Measure the dimensions of the frame opening with a ruler. With a pencil, draw out a rectangle with matching dimensions onto a piece of cardboard or plywood. If you\u2019re using cardboard, cut it out with scissors or a blade. For plywood, you\u2019ll need to use a jigsaw or table saw. It might be a little quicker to carefully trace the glass panel or the frame backing onto the cardboard or plywood, rather than marking out the measurements with a ruler. Staple the fabric around the outside edges of the panel. With the fabric face-down on your work surface, place the cardboard or plywood panel down on to the center of the fabric. Wrap each edge of fabric around the edge of the panel, and staple or glue it in place. Make sure your fabric is arranged smoothly around the front of the panel since this is what you\u2019ll see. Pull the fabric taut and smooth out any bubbles as you go. You can also check the front to make sure it\u2019s staying smooth. Insert the fabric panel into the frame opening and secure it. Place the fabric-covered panel into the frame opening, with the raw edges facing the back of the frame. Press down the existing tabs or swivel the turnbuttons to hold the panel in place.",
