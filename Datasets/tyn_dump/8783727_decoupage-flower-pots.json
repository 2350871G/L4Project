How long it takes for each coat to dry depends on the type of sealant you are using. If you plan on putting a plant into the pot, it would be best to use an oil-based sealant. If you'll be using the pot as a decoration or to hold craft supplies, you can use a water-based sealant. The sealant is important, especially if you'll be adding a plant. It will keep moisture from sinking into the pot and causing the paint/glue to bubble."
