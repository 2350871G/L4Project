Use small circular motions across the flat surfaces and apply firm pressure to smooth out any raised areas so the paint can adhere to the wood easier. Blow any sawdust off the wood\u2019s surface as you work so you see the areas that you already smoothed out. Be careful as you work around the corners or edges since you could make them rounded and affect how well the box closes.

Dremel rotary tools have small spinning heads that make them easy to work with for carving designs into wood. You can buy them from your local hardware store. You may also hold the tool sideways so the wider end presses against the wood if you want to make larger recessed areas in the wood. You can carve into the wood as deep as you want, but be careful not to punch through to the inside of the box.

Resize the image in editing software so it\u2019s the same size as the final design you want to attach on to the box. Preview the image before printing it out to ensure it doesn\u2019t get cut off around the edges. Turn the image settings to the highest quality before clicking the Print button. If you don\u2019t have access to a printer, try going to a library or local print shop to print the image for you.Variation: You can also use pieces of thin fabric, pattern paper, or decorative napkins for your decoupage if you don\u2019t want to print off an image. Apply a layer of decoupage glue on the box where you want your image. Dip a foam brush into the decoupage glue and wipe off any excess that's dripping off. Paint a thin layer of the glue on the surface of the box where you want to attach the image. Make sure the glue doesn\u2019t have any bubbles or raised areas that may affect how the image lays on the box. You can buy decoupage glue from your local craft store or online. Decoupage glue will start to dry within an hour, so be sure to work quickly as soon as you apply it. Lay the printed image flat on the box. Carefully set the image down on the wood and press it down firmly. Push out any bubbles or wrinkles from the center toward the edges of the image with your fingers to smooth it out. Use gentle pressure so you don\u2019t rip the paper, or else you\u2019ll have to start over. Make sure the image you\u2019re using doesn\u2019t have any wrinkles or creases, or else it may not lie properly on the wood. Brush the decoupage glue over the image and let it dry for 1 day. Dip your brush in the decoupage glue again and wipe off any excess. Work from the center of the image toward the edges so you apply a thin layer across the entire surface. Use gentle pressure so you don\u2019t damage the image or rip the paper. Let the decoupage glue set completely for 24 hours. Decoupage glue dries clear so you\u2019ll still be able to see the image when you\u2019re finished. Carefully wipe off any excess decoupage glue with a paper towel if there are still large drops left on the box. Rub away any edges around the image with a damp sponge. Wet a sponge in warm water and wring it out completely so it doesn\u2019t drip. Gently rub around any exposed edges of the paper that aren\u2019t part of the design. Wipe away any balled-up paper that forms around the edges so only the parts of your design are left attached to the box. You can also try using 220-grit sandpaper, but you may also scratch off some of the paint from the box. Spread a layer of acrylic varnish on the box to seal it. Get a glossy or matte finish varnish and mix it slowly with a stir stick. Dip the tip of a natural-bristle brush into the varnish and wipe off any excess drops. Pull the brush gently over the wood in long straight strokes to apply a thin layer of the varnish. Allow the varnish to dry for at least 4 hours so it has time to set. Work in a well-ventilated area while working with varnish since it may create harmful fumes that cause irritation. Engraving and Staining Designs Print out the design you want to add onto the box. Resize the design on your computer with editing software so it\u2019s as large as you want the final image to appear on the box. Use the Print Preview function to make sure the design doesn\u2019t get cut off when you print it. Set it to the highest quality image before printing it out for your design. You may also draw your design by hand if you don\u2019t want to print one out. If you don\u2019t have access to a printer, check for local print shops or libraries to see if you can print your design there. Place a piece of carbon paper between the printed design and the box. Set the layer of carbon paper on your box where you want to engrave your design. Make sure the darker side of the carbon paper touches the wood, or else the image won\u2019t transfer correctly. Put your design face-up on top of the carbon paper and tape it to the box so it doesn\u2019t move or shift around while you\u2019re working. Carbon paper has a dark layer of carbon on one side, so when you write or draw something on the light side, the image will transfer onto the surface underneath it. You can buy carbon paper from your local hardware store or online. Trace around the outline of your design with a pencil. Apply firm pressure with a pencil around the outline of your design. Make sure you go around the entire outline, or the design won\u2019t transfer onto the box. Lift up a corner of the paper while you\u2019re working to check if you\u2019re able to see the lines on the wood. If not, tape the paper back down and press harder with your pencil. You may also use a pen or any other sharp writing instrument. Be careful not to rip through the paper since you could damage the wood.Warning: Be careful not to rub the paper with your hand while you\u2019re tracing your design since you may cause more carbon to transfer, making it difficult to see the traced lines. Carve around the outlines with a Dremel rotary tool. Use the cone-shaped attachment in the Dremel tool so you have the most control while you\u2019re working. Hold the tool like a pencil before turning it on so it comes up to full speed. Press the tip into the wood and follow along with your outline. Lift the tool up frequently and blow away any sawdust so you can see where you\u2019re working. Keep working around the outline until you\u2019ve carved out the entire outline. Dremel rotary tools have small spinning heads that make them easy to work with for carving designs into wood. You can buy them from your local hardware store. You may also hold the tool sideways so the wider end presses against the wood if you want to make larger recessed areas in the wood. You can carve into the wood as deep as you want, but be careful not to punch through to the inside of the box. Never touch the rotating head while the Dremel tool is on since you could seriously injure yourself. Sand any rough edges with 180-grit sandpaper. Go around your design and apply light pressure with the sandpaper to remove any raised or rough areas. Work in short back and forth motions so you don\u2019t ruin the carved design. Blow away the sawdust while you\u2019re working so you can clearly see which areas you\u2019ve already sanded. If there are still rough edges, try using 220-grit sandpaper to smooth it out more. Rub wood stain onto the box with a rag or shop cloth. Choose the color stain you want for your box, and dip the end of a rag or shop cloth in it. Rub the stain onto the wood following the direction of the grain so it absorbs the best. Keep applying the stain until you coat the entire surface of the wood so it has a uniform color. Allow the stain to dry for about 4 hours. The stain will usually look darker in engraved areas, which will help your design look more prominent. Seal the box with polyurethane wood finish to seal the stain. Mix the wood finish with a stir stick slowly so it doesn\u2019t form any bubbles. Dip the end of a natural-bristle brush into the finish and wipe off any excess. Use long, straight strokes across the surface of the wood, making sure to apply a thin and even layer. Smooth out the finish with the tips of the bristles before letting it dry for 4 hours. You can apply a second layer of wood finish if you want additional protection. Wood finish creates harmful fumes, so work in a well-ventilated area while using it.",
