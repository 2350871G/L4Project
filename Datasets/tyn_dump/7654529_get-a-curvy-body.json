Hug your right leg into your chest while your left leg goes straight out to a 45-degree angle. Pull your knee in twice and then switch legs. Repeat for 60 seconds. Continue with the \u201cdouble leg stretch.\u201d Start in table top while hugging your legs. Lift your head and shoulders off the floor to activate your core.

Lower your legs and arms down and reach them as long as you can on your mat to stretch out your abdominal muscles. Sculpting Hips and Butt Embrace strengthening exercises. Do 30 minutes of bodyweight exercises, weight machines or free weights 2 to 3 times a week on nonconsecutive days. Weightlifting in addition to cardio will help to tone muscles in the areas of your choice. Try butt-toning exercises every other day. Get on all fours on an exercise mat. Lift 1 leg straight out behind you at a low angle. Pulse your foot toward the ceiling in small movements for 1 minute. Switch legs and repeat. Exercise your hips every other day. Lay down with your arms flat against the ground. Bend your knees at a 90-degree angle and plant your feet firmly on the ground. Lift your hips so they are parallel with your knees.
