An area variance is required when the configuration of the lot dictates that the zoning regulations simply be relaxed. Common examples of area variances would be exceptions for minimum setbacks from the property line and minimum floor areas. A use variance is required when the building's intended use will violate the zoning ordinances; for example, a use variance would be required to build an office building in a residential neighborhood. Use variances are much harder to obtain than area variances."
