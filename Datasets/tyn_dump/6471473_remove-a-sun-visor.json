                    "description": "Wedge the tip of a flat screwdriver beneath the plastic cover of the main assembly. Carefully use the screwdriver to pry the cover completely off. The main assembly is the area where the sun visor remains fastened to the ceiling, and it should lie opposite the hook side. The plastic cover you need to remove will hide the main assembly from sight initially. Look closely at the plastic cover. There should be a slit running down a portion of the top surface. Insert the screwdriver into that slit from the side, easing the tip beneath the cover as you do. Gently wiggle the screwdriver around until the plastic cover pops off. You do need to work carefully since forcing the cover off with too much pressure can cause it to crack or otherwise break. After the cover pops off, pull as much down as possible. If the back gets stuck, move the sun visor around to free the stuck portion so that you can remove it cleanly."

The number of screws will vary depending on the make and model of the car. In most cases, you'll need to remove two to four screws. Check all sides of the main assembly to locate all the screws. Some of these screws will likely be torx screws, but you should be able to remove them with a flat screwdriver if you do not have a specialized one for this screw type. Work carefully.
