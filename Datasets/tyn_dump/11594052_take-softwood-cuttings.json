        "Repeat the process with the other cuttings so they\u2019re more likely to grow.",
        "You can buy rooting hormone powder from your local gardening store.Tip: Throw out any leftover rooting hormone powder rather than putting it back in the original container.",
        "That way, you can prevent contamination or disease later on.",
        "Place the cut ends into the holes and firm up the compost around them.",
        "Put the cuttings into their holes one at a time so they\u2019re easier to work with.",
        "Set the cut end into the hole so the cutting stands up vertically.",
        "Compact the compost mixture so it forms a small hill around the base of the cutting to prevent it from tipping over.",
        "Continue planting the rest of your cuttings in the pot.",
        "Don\u2019t let the compost mixture touch the leaves since you could cause your propagations to develop rot.",
        "Caring for the Cuttings Cover the pot with a plastic bag and rubber band to trap humidity.",
        "Use a clear plastic bag that\u2019s large enough to fit around the rim of the pot and contain the cuttings without touching them.",
        "Slide the bag over the edge of the pot and seal it with a rubber band to help keep the moisture and humidity inside the container.",
        "Make sure the bag doesn\u2019t touch any of the leaves, or else moisture could get on them and develop rot.",
        "You can use an old grocery bag or even a milk jug for your cover as well.Tip: If the plastic bag touches your cuttings, poke wooden stakes that are taller than the cuttings around the edge of the pot before putting the plastic bag over it.",
        "Set the pot in an area with bright light out of direct sun.",
        "Keep the pot somewhere indoors, such as a south-facing window, or in a spot outside that has light shade throughout the day.",
        "Store the pot there through the entire rooting process to ensure that the plant gets enough light and nutrients.",
        "Leave the bag on the pot while the cuttings take root so the heat gets trapped inside and warms the compost mixture.",
        "You may also use a growing light for your cuttings if you\u2019re keeping them indoors.",
        "Avoid direct sunlight since it could cause the foliage to grow more than the roots and make your plants unhealthy.",
        "Mist the growing medium if it starts drying out.",
        "Feel the surface of the compost mixture with your finger every 2\u20133 days to see if it\u2019s dry to the touch.",
        "If it still feels moist, leave the cuttings alone so they don\u2019t get overwatered.",
        "If the surface feels dry or grainy, fill a spray bottle with clean water and mist the compost mixture until it\u2019s damp again.",
        "Try to use purified water if you\u2019re able to so your cuttings don\u2019t get any contamination.",
        "You can also use your watering can if you don\u2019t have a spray bottle available.",
        "Remove the plastic bag after 6\u20138 weeks to harden off the plants.",
        "After 6\u20138 weeks, your cuttings will have established roots of their own and are ready to be exposed to open air.",
        "Pull off the plastic bag and leave the cuttings in the same spot.",
        "Water and care for the plants as you normally would so they continue growing.",
        "Hardening off gets the cuttings used to a growing environment so they aren\u2019t stressed when they\u2019re transplanted.",
        "If the leaves on your cuttings wilt, they may not grow well when you transplant them.",
        "Transplant the cuttings to separate containers 3\u20134 days after taking off the bag.",
        "Carefully dig around the base of each cutting to free up the roots.",
        "Choose pots that are at least twice as wide and twice as deep as the root systems for your cuttings, and fill them halfway with equal parts compost and coarse sand.",
        "Lift the cuttings by their roots and set them in their own pots.",
        "Fill in the rest of the compost mixture around the plant so the cuttings can continue growing.",
        "Don\u2019t transplant the cuttings directly into the ground since they may not successfully grow.",
        "Try to keep the cuttings in their pots until the next spring when the plants are more established."
