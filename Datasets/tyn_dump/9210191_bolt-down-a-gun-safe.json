Fireproof gun safes often place holes at the center; traditional gun safes tend to put anchor holes in the corners.

Some may not have anchor holes at all. If your gun safe doesn\u2019t have an anchor hole, you\u2019ll have to improvise an anchor by doing things like chaining down your gun safe or welding it to a metal support."

Some drills may have an adjustable depth setting on the body of the drill. Otherwise, use tape to mark the depth on the bit. Cement dust and fragments can be very dangerous. Always wear safety goggles, a respirator, and work gloves when drilling cement. Start drilling with slow speed and moderate pressure.
