A block of ice this size will be about 11 by 11 by 16 inches (28 \u00d7 28 \u00d7 41 cm). If you decide to order your ice, you can look online to find an ice company near you. You can either transport the ice yourself in a large cooler or you can have it delivered.

However, you may want to trace your design onto posterboard or wallpaper first, then use an adhesive to apply the template to the ice. Wallpaper is designed to get wet without tearing, making it an ideal surface for stenciling your sculpture.

Chisels can help you get into smaller areas to create more intricate designs. If you have a set of chisels in different sizes, start with the largest chisel and work your way to the smallest.
