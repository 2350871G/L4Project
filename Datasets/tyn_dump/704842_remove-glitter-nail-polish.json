If you don\u2019t have aluminum foil, a rubber band or hair elastic will do the trick just as nicely. What you really want is something that will hold the cotton ball in place against your fingernail. Soak a cotton ball in acetone-based nail polish remover. Acetone is an extremely powerful solvent that can remove all types of nail polish. Use acetone-based remover in order to remove your glitter polish more effectively. While it\u2019s powerful, it\u2019s also harsh on your nails, so try to use it as infrequently as possible. Tear ten strips of aluminum foil. Tear off a couple sheets of foil and tear each sheet into several pieces. Each piece should be about as big as your palm and in the shape of a rectangle. You can also substitute the aluminum foil for ten small rubber bands or hair elastics. Place the saturated cotton ball on your fingernail. Press the cotton ball, saturated side down, onto your nail. Wrap the foil around your finger. Put the aluminum foil strip over the top of your finger so that it\u2019s wider horizontally, and then wrap it firmly around your fingertip so that it won\u2019t fall off. Putting the foil on will help to keep the cotton ball in place. Fold down any aluminum that\u2019s extending past your nail. If you\u2019re using bands instead of foil, wrap a band around the cotton ball and your finger.

If you\u2019re in a rush, sit in the sunlight while you let your nails soak. The heat will slightly speed up the process, allowing you to remove the foil and cotton balls in 3-5 minutes. Pinch the foil pieces off. While applying a bit of pressure, drag the foil-wrapped cotton ball across and off your nail in one swift movement. This should take most if not all of the glitter polish off of your nails. Rubbing off Remaining Glitter Saturate new cotton balls with nail polish remover. If there is still a bit of glitter polish on your nails at this point, heavily saturate a couple more cotton balls in an acetone-based nail polish remover. You can also use an exfoliating cotton makeup wipe. These wipes have ridges that make it possible to create more friction. Rub the cotton ball up and down your nails. Press down hard and rub your nail with the cotton ball wherever glitter polish remains. If one side of your cotton ball gets covered in glitter, flip to the other side and continue to scrub.

If you still aren\u2019t having any luck, submerge your fingertips for another 30 seconds. Repeat this process on your other hand. Applying a Glue Base Coat Clean out an old nail polish bottle. Before you put on glitter polish, track down an old, empty bottle of nail polish. Fill the bottle with nail polish remover and swirl it around, and then rinse it out thoroughly with hot water until it\u2019s clean. Fill the bottle with a mixture of glue and water. Once it\u2019s clean, fill the empty bottle up about \u2153 of the way with liquid school glue, such as Elmer\u2019s. Add a little water to the glue and shake it up, so that it\u2019s spreadable. Apply the mixture to your nails before putting your glitter polish on. Apply your glue base coat just like you would apply a regular base coat. Make sure you wait a solid 5 minutes for the glue to dry completely before you put your glitter polish on. If the mixture looks particularly streaky while you\u2019re applying it, you may need to add a little more glue, shake up the bottle, and try to apply it again. Regular showering and hand washing may break the glue down quickly. Use less glue in your mixture if you want your polish to stay on longer. Peel or scrape the polish off once it\u2019s time to remove it. Days later when you\u2019re ready to remove your polish, you should be able to by simply peeling it off. If this doesn\u2019t work, try scraping is off with a wooden nail stick.",
