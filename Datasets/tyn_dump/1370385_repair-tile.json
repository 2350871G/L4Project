Use an electric drill with a masonry bit to drill a diagonal series of small holes into the cracked tile, keeping drilled holes less than 1 inch (2.54 cm) apart. Split the tile through the horizontal hole-line by using a ball-peen hammer to tap a cold chisel into the tile. Tap very lightly so as not to crack neighboring grout joints. Remove the loosened pieces. Use a flat bar to pry up any shards that you cannot get up by hand. Scrape the remaining old mortar from the subfloor using a stiff-bladed scraper. It is not important that you get every last bit up. Just make sure the area is fairly clean of mortar. Vacuum up any loose dirt or debris."
