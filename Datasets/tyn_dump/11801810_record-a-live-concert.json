The operator can cut out the sound from different instruments to prevent them from getting too loud, and it can have a serious effect on your recording.Some setups only pick up certain instruments, like the bass. If you run into this problem, you can deal with it by using a mic splitter and your own microphones. A mic splitter sends a separate recording to your recorder and the sound system. If an instrument isn\u2019t recorded through a microphone connected to the mixer, it is most likely being picked up through an amplifier. For example, guitars are often recorded this way, and, as soon as the guitarist turns up the amp, you get clipping in your recording."

If they do something you don\u2019t expect, it will show up on the recording.Make sure that the sound system is receiving input from all of the instruments on stage, or else you may end up with an incomplete recording.

Move them back if the music sounds a little loud or distorted. If you\u2019re working with the band, ask them to play their instruments after each adjustment you make. Turn on your recorder and leave it in place during the concert. Stay by it to make sure it\u2019s still working and that no one accidentally knocks it off its perch. You can\u2019t really do much with what you\u2019re recording until you get it back home. Watch the recorder screen to see that it\u2019s receiving sound from each microphone you\u2019re using. Also, check the microphone cords on occasion to see that they are all plugged in and working too.If you notice any problems, make adjustments as best you can. You might be able to reposition your gear, for instance. If you took care when setting it up your equipment, the recording will most likely turn out fine. However, hiccups are inevitable, so having a backup plan always pays off! Using Front-Of-House Equipment Ask the venue\u2019s sound operator to use their equipment to record. If you have a chance, introduce yourself to the sound operator in advance. Many venues have a front of house (FOH) sound system that controls sound in the venue, and you can use this to set up your recording equipment. However, the equipment varies wildly between venues, and not all sound operators work the same way. Let them know that you want to record the show, and ask for their help. If you\u2019re able to, call the venue operator or promoter in advance to ask for permission to record. No matter who you talk to, being polite will make it more likely that you get a great recording. Some sound operators won\u2019t help you. They may be recording the show themselves or simply not have room for your equipment. Examine the sound system to determine how it works. First, find out if the control panel has an output you can connect your recorder to in order to record sounds from it. Then, ask what instruments the operator plans on picking up through the mixer. The operator can cut out the sound from different instruments to prevent them from getting too loud, and it can have a serious effect on your recording.Some setups only pick up certain instruments, like the bass. If you run into this problem, you can deal with it by using a mic splitter and your own microphones. A mic splitter sends a separate recording to your recorder and the sound system. If an instrument isn\u2019t recorded through a microphone connected to the mixer, it is most likely being picked up through an amplifier. For example, guitars are often recorded this way, and, as soon as the guitarist turns up the amp, you get clipping in your recording. Connect your recorder to the sound system, if possible. If the mixer control panel on the sound system has an output and no one else is using it, you can take advantage of it. You will end up with a stereo recording, which means that the recorder picks up the sound in full. The downside is that it requires good cooperation between you, the sound operator, and the band. If they do something you don\u2019t expect, it will show up on the recording.Make sure that the sound system is receiving input from all of the instruments on stage, or else you may end up with an incomplete recording. The operator has to keep the sound levels consistent for this to work. If someone suddenly turns up an amp, for instance, your recording will end up distorted. Set up a mic splitter in order to capture sound independently. To be able to do this, you will have to get a separate piece of hardware. The mic splitter connects to both your recorder and the sound system so they both record the sound. Some venues already have splitters in place, but having your own doesn\u2019t hurt.You can get an inexpensive mic splitter with up to 8 outlets for about $300. Make sure your mic splitter has input ports for any extra microphones you plan on setting up. Set up extra microphones to record different parts of the concert. If the venue allows you to set up microphones, you can connect them to a mic splitter to get a fuller sound. Try placing an omnidirectional microphone near the crowd, for instance, to pick up the concert\u2019s sound in all directions. You could also set a few condenser microphones to the left and right of the stage, since they are much more sensitive than other types of microphones. To record individual instruments, place your own microphones on the stage, such as one near the drums.Use multiple microphones to make a multitrack recording. By doing this, you can record each sound source separately. You can then edit all of these recordings into one perfect concert. Monitor the recording equipment while the concert is going on. If you\u2019re hooked up to the venue\u2019s equipment, the sound operator will take care of things. Just make sure your recorder and microphones are on. Keep an eye on them throughout the show to ensure they all continue to work. You won\u2019t be able to do much except keep the recorder running and reposition your equipment as needed.Take a peek at the mixing board used by the sound operator. If you know how it works, you can figure out how it affects your recording. Note when the operator adjusts the volume levels and remind them of your recording if you think the changes will hurt it. If you know the performers, you may be able to give them instructions, such as reminding them not to tune their instruments up too high. It\u2019s easy for them to forget while they are performing. Filming with a Camcorder or Phone Ask for permission before attempting to film a concert. Contact the band to let them know you would like to film the show. If you\u2019re going to an established concert venue, check in with the staff to ensure that filming is permitted. It\u2019s best to do this as early as possible to plan accordingly. In some cases, they will make arrangements for you, such as setting up a filming area or interviews. Technically, it is illegal to record musicians without their permission, even if you\u2019re just using a phone. However, most people won\u2019t care if you record with a cell phone. For big concerts, you have to apply for a photo pass in order to do any sort of filming. You have to contact the band or concert organizer, but you won\u2019t get a pass unless you\u2019re a  professional journalist or photographer. Find a good spot with a clear view of the stage. If you\u2019re filming the concert with permission, the place to be is usually at the foot of the stage. Many places will leave a little bit of space between the crowd and the stage. You can set up your cameras there, but you might also wish to place some along the sides of the stage to get a better variety of angles. You could also carry a camera around on stage, but make sure the performers know you\u2019re going to do this.If you\u2019re a fan in the crowd, look for some space away from other people. Check near the sound engineer\u2019s control booth, handicap areas, and speakers. Get up close to the stage if you are able to. To pick out good filming spots, arrive at the venue early. Try attending during another concert, for instance. Use multiple cameras to capture a better view throughout the concert. One camera is fine if that is all you have available. If you\u2019re able to, however, you might want to set up a camera on either side of the stage. You could also set a camera further back for a wider angle. You might also use a handheld camera to carry around for more dynamic shots.If you\u2019re using multiple cameras, you most likely will need someone to operate each one. When filming, make sure each camera has a good view of the concert. Make sure it is stable so the video quality is as high as it can be. Set up tripods so you are able to film with better stability. Tripods serve as secure spots for cameras and phones, but they also allow you to do some filming tricks like panning across the stage. You can get inexpensive tripods for about $10. Use one for each camera you plan on setting up. Shakiness is a common nuisance in filming, but you can limit it with the right tools.You could also use a device like a handheld phone clamp or camera steadier. These devices will give you a little more freedom of movement. If you\u2019re going to hold a camera while filming, practice! Make sure you\u2019re able to hold it steady, even while moving it. Make sure you have permission to bring equipment into a venue. If you\u2019re going to a concert venue as a fan, you are most likely going to have to hold your phone up the entire time. Secure a microphone to your camera for better sound quality. Try using a wireless microphone so you don\u2019t have to deal with an extra cord hanging from your camera. If you can, get a shotgun microphone. When you point it directly at the stage, it will pick up only the sound ahead of it. You could also use a cardioid microphone for a fuller recording, since it picks up noises to the left and right, including from the crowd. If you\u2019re using your phone, get a plug-in microphone for better sound quality. There are some versions that plug directly into a phone\u2019s headphone jack. Some microphones require you to plug in a microphone adapter first. If you\u2019re recording audio professionally, set up microphones close to the stage to make the ultimate recording! Try using 1 or 2 microphones near the stage, for instance. Record the concert with a steady hand and little movement. It\u2019s concert time and you\u2019re all set up. Turn on your recorder, then keep it pointed at the stage. You usually won\u2019t have to do much but keep it steady while preventing other people from getting in your way. If you\u2019re using a camera on a mount, try moving the camera around to capture different angles, but make sure the footage doesn\u2019t come out shaky.When filming, you\u2019re better off standing in one place away from the crowds rather than trying to move around. You may not find a good spot elsewhere. For audio recordings, try to keep your recorder above the crowd. If you\u2019re close enough, getting the best possible quality won\u2019t be a problem, but the sound can get muffled if you move around too much.",
