Fortunately, it\u2019s easy to fix this in a pinch with a safety pin. Hold the gap together where you want to secure it, then use your free hand to insert the safety pin on the inside of your top. Thread the pin back through the front of your top and secure it on the inside of your neckline. The safety pin shouldn\u2019t be visible from the outside. If it is, take the safety pin back out and try again. Wrap tops have a front closure that's formed when the 2 sides cross over your chest. It might be secured by a tie, button, or stitching if it's a faux wrap. This fix only works for wrap tops and will be too noticeable on other styles."

Leave the edges of the new neckline open so you can adjust the cord as needed.
