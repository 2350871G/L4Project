Maybe you don't feel comfortable in some of your clothes because they are not what people are used to seeing you in - if your sexy outfit is for a situation where you're meeting new people, take the opportunity to make a sexy first impression. Something you've dismissed as too small or too big might flatter you now, try it on! You can use a belt to define your waist in bigger clothes or if things won't  do up but still look good, a belt can keep them in place."
