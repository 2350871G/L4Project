Additionally, it\u2019s best to wear long sleeves, long pants, and close-toed shoes. Go outside and choose a spot far away from heat sources.Keep your protective gear on at all times to stay safe. It's best to work on a rubber mat, which will prevent static build up and won't conduct electricity, which can trigger your propellant.Warning: Be sure to discharge static buildup by touching a grounded metal object. This can prevent you from accidentally releasing a static charge around your propellant. Tip: It's best to wear an air filtered respirator as you handle these ingredients because the particles are fine. You don't want to inhale them."

Then, use your gloved fingers to pack the paste into the end of the tube. This will cap off your rocket body.Remember, clumpy cat litter paste is okay, so don\u2019t add a lot of water. Use your 6D nail to poke a hole in the cat litter paste. Gently poke your nail through the cat litter paste so that your core goes through the entire rocket body. Rotate the nail as you remove it so that the hole remains. This will help your rocket burn evenly as it ignites. Tape a stick or skewer to your rocket so you can put it in the ground. Choose a thin stick or skewer that will be easy to poke into the ground. However, make sure it\u2019s thick enough to support your rocket. Place the stick or skewer against the rocket body, then apply several layers of masking tape or electrical tape.You might prefer to glue the stick or skewer onto the rocket base first to make it more stable. However, this isn\u2019t necessary. Insert a fuse into your core, leaving the end sticking out. Use your 6D nail to gently push the fuse up into the core, leaving a long end sticking out. If the fuse is smaller than the core, you may want to fold it over first so that it sticks up inside the rocket. Pack a wad of paper behind the fuse to keep it in place.If you're not using the rocket right away, fit a small piece of plastic wrap over the base of your rocket, then use a tiny amount of hot glue or white school glue to seal around the edges. This will keep it airtight. The fuse should go up into the core of the rocket so that it lights the fuel. Additionally, you want a long tail on your fuse to allow you time to move to safety. Put your rocket into the ground in an open space before lighting it. Choose an area that\u2019s far away from buildings, people, pets, trees, and flammable objects. Additionally, check with the person who owns the land to make sure you have permission. Stand far away from your rocket when you light it.It's best to use an electric ignition to light your rocket so you can stand at a safe distance.",

        "A rock tumbler will mix your ingredients more thoroughly so your rocket has better thrust.",
        "Put the potassium nitrate and powdered sugar into a rock tumbler.",
        "Then, bring your rock tumbler outside while you mix the propellant.",
        "Turn the rock tumbler on and set a timer for at least 6 hours.",
        "It's best to place your mixer in a hole in the ground so that accidental blasts are controlled.",
        "Leave the top of the hole open to direct the blast upward.",
        "Make sure the rock tumbler is far away from other heat sources.",
        "Work in small batches until you're very experienced in working with propellant.",
        "This will reduce the risk of a fire or explosion.Tip: You need to use your propellant within 3 weeks of mixing it because it will start to lose its thrust.",
        "Additionally, the powdered sugar can attract moisture that may ruin the propellant.",
        "Be sure to keep it in an airtight container.",
        "Shake the container to mix the ingredients as an alternative.",
        "Shaking won't mix your ingredients as well, and you'll need to do it for at least an hour total.",
        "With the lid on the container, manually shake it back and forth to mix up your rocket fuel.",
        "Be sure to stand away from heat sources and open flames.",
