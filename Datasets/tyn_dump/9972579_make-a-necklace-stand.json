    "text": " Using Wooden Candleholders and Dowels Find the center of your dowel with a ruler and mark it with a pencil. Measure the length of your wooden dowel, and divide your measurement in half to find the center. When you find your center, make a small mark with a pencil or pen so you can clearly see it. For example, if your wooden dowel is 5 in (13 cm), the middle will be at 2.5 in (6.4 cm). You can purchase wooden dowels at most home supply and craft stores. Apply hot glue around the top of the candle holder base. You can use a wooden candle holder about 6\u201316 in (15\u201341 cm) tall, and choose either tapered or pedestal holders. Stand your candle holder upright on a clean, flat surface. Let your hot glue gun warm up, and pull on the trigger to release the glue. Apply glue all the way around the top of your candle holder. This way, you can easily secure the wooden dowel to the top of your candle holder. You can get candle holders at most craft stores or thrift stores. Hold the wooden dowel horizontally on top of the candle holder base. Center the mark you made on the wooden dowel with the top of the candle holder. Then, place the dowel on top of the candle holder horizontally. Press down on the dowel with moderate pressure so they adhere to each other. Use the center point you marked on the dowel to guide your placement. Spray an even coat of primer after about 30-40 minutes. Wait about a half hour for the glue to set, then place your necklace holder on top of a layer of newspaper or plastic drop cloth. Spray a light, even layer of primer over all of your necklace stand. This helps the paint adhere to the necklace stand. Cover your jewelry stand with spray paint after the primer dries. Wait about 15-30 minutes for your primer to dry, then spray an even coat of spray paint over top of your necklace stand. You can spray a second coat over top of your stand after the first coat dries (about 20 minutes). Use whatever spray paint color you'd like! Let your stand sit for 24 hours before adding details or necklaces. Leave your necklace stand in a dry spot where it will not be disturbed. Then, you can hang your necklaces across the horizontal dowel. If you'd like, accessorize your necklace stand with wooden objects, fake flowers, or other trinkets. Simply squeeze some hot glue on the bottom of your object, and press it to your stand for 30 seconds. For example, you can glue on artificial flowers for a springtime theme. Other accessory details include wooden birds, letters, or rhinestones. Using Paper Towel Rolls and Cardboard Cut your cardboard to 11 in \u00d7 17 in (28 cm \u00d7 43 cm) to make the base. Find a scrap piece of cardboard, and mark the cardboard to 11 in (28 cm) wide and 17 in (43 cm) long using a ruler and pencil. Then, cut it out using a pair of scissors. Glue your cardboard to a piece of fabric. Purchase 1 yard of fabric to use for your cardboard base and to cover your necklace stand.

Select a branch about 12\u201318 in (30\u201346 cm) long and \u20444 in (0.64 cm) wide so you can easily drill a screw into the base. In addition, look for smaller branches about 5\u201310 in (13\u201325 cm) long to use for your necklace hangers. Gather your branches and bring them home with you. Squeeze a nickel-size amount of hot glue onto the center of your plaque. You can use a beveled, round, or square plaque between 4 in \u00d7 6 in (10 cm \u00d7 15 cm) and 9 in \u00d7 12 in (23 cm \u00d7 30 cm).

Drill the screw through both the wooden plaque and your tree branch. Be sure to hold your branch firmly and keep an eye on your fingers to prevent any injury.
