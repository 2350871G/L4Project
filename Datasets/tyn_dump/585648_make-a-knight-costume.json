                    "description": "Some fantastical depictions, like the movie Lord of the Rings, show some noble characters, like elves, going into battle with a circlet in place of the traditional medieval battle helm. To give yourself an air of nobility, a circlet might be the way to go, but if you want to come across as a no-nonsense knight, you might prefer a battle helm. Circlet: take your card stock and draw a crown. You can do this in a traditional style, with the crown coming to elaborate points over the head, but in principle, cut a strip of construction paper wide enough to fit around your head in the shape of a crown. This will form the headband. Wrap the strip of paper around your head to find the appropriate length for your head. Cut and fasten the two ends of your paper together with tape or a stapler. If you have no card stock and no time to get any, a shirt box will work in a pinch. Battle Helmet: use a plate or circular object to help draw a circle on your silver card stock that is bigger than your head for the top piece of your helmet. Add a point to your circle that comes out to one side, making a teardrop shape. This point will be the front of your helmet. Now outline your teardrop shape so there is about an inch in between the two lines. Cut along your outer line, clipping slits in your inch margin between first and second lines. Fold your inch margin down to form tabs to connect the top and bottom pieces. Make the bottom piece by cutting a 10 to 20 inch piece of silver card stock, folding it in half longways, and then cutting a triangle that has its right angle opposite the crease. This will be where the top of your helmet inserts. Along the fold, cut a slit or slits for eye holes, and then fit your tabs into the opening of your bottom piece, stapling, taping, or gluing the two pieces together."

You can cut almost any simple medieval weapon (ax, trident, spear) from cardboard. You can achieve the same metallic effect with some paints. Use metallic paint to give your sword a unique design."
