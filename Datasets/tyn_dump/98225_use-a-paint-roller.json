                    "description": "Long sleeves work well for painting large areas like walls, and shorter sleeves are ideal to paint small or narrow areas. Make sure the sleeve fits your roller frame. Choose a nap or sleeve thickness, that will work best with the texture of the surface you are painting. Walls with a coarse texture will require a longer nap than walls with a light texture. For oil-based paints use a synthetic or natural fiber sleeve, and for latex-based paints only use a synthetic sleeve. Use a \u20448 in (0.95 cm) nap on interior walls that have a light texture, and use a \u20444 in (1.9 cm) nap on exterior walls that have a coarse texture like stucco. Avoid buying a cheap or single-use roller sleeve. It will not hold as much paint as a quality-grade sleeve, and it will not spread the paint as evenly. The average wool-polyester blend sleeve will only cost you about $6.00 (5.18 euros) at a local hardware or paint store."

Do not overfill the well in the pan. It is very easy to spill the paint when loading the roller if the pan is overfilled. For large areas, use a bucket with a roller screen placed inside.
