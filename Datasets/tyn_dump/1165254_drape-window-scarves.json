Hook the scarf on each end of the curtain rod and let the sides hang down evenly. You can pin the window scarf together on the parts in the middle where it overlaps to keep the shape you created in place. Hanging Window Scarves with Hooks Install scarf hooks at both corners of the top of the window. Measure 3 in (7.6 cm) past the corners of the window frame and make a mark with a pencil. Hold the hooks in place over your mark and mark where the holes will go, then place a screw in 1 hole and screw it in with a drill. Repeat this for each hole, making sure the holes are lined up over your marks, to secure the hooks in place.

You could install more than 1 hook above the middle of the window frame if you want to create more drapes in the window scarf. It is completely up to you and the style you want to end up with.

Measure from the corner of the window down to where you want the ends of the curtain scarf to reach. It is totally up to you and the effect you want to create to determine how long you want the ends of the curtain scarf to be. Measure across the window from 1 corner hook to the other. Stretch a tape measure across the window after you install the scarf hooks. Double this number so you get enough fabric to create drapes. If the window is 60 in (150 cm) wide, then double that to get 120 in (300 cm) for your 2nd measurement. Add the numbers together to determine the length of fabric to purchase. Take the 1st measurement you got for the length and add it to the 2nd measurement you got by doubling the width. This number is how long a piece of fabric you need for your window scarf. If you want the window scarf to reach down 30 in (76 cm) from the top of the window on each side, and the window is 60 in (150 cm) from corner hook to corner hook, then get a window scarf that is 180 in (460 cm) long. Use fabric that is at least 22 in (56 cm) for a curtain scarf to create wide enough drapes. Hang the window scarf over the middle hook and the corner hooks. Find the center of the fabric and hang it over the middle hook first. Then hook the fabric over the 2 hooks in the corners and let the sides dangle down. If you have more than 1 hook in the middle, always start with hanging the center of the fabric over the center hook first so that each side is even. You can knot the window scarf around the corner hooks to secure it in place. Adding Extra Details Layer different window scarves to add regal elegance to your windows. Stretch a scarf straight across the top of the window from hook to hook or along a curtain rod. Drape another scarf as you normally would from hook to hook, or wrapped around a curtain rod in front of the shorter scarf, to create a layered look. Play with different fabrics to get the look you want. Try a delicate fabric of a lighter color in the back, and a heavier, darker fabric for the front scarf. Fold and tie your scarf to add details.
