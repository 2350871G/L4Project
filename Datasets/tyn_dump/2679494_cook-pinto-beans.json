Run the beans under cool water and move the colander around so that water touches each side of the beans. Move your colander up and down and side-to-side to rotate your beans so that the entirety of each bean gets wet. You only need to soak uncooked pinto beans. If you\u2019ve got a can of pinto beans, they\u2019ve already been cooked and only need to be reheated. If you see any blackened or cracked beans, pick them out and throw them away. Put your pinto beans in a large bowl by dumping them in. Any bowl that can sit in your refrigerator and can be covered will work. Pour beans into the bowl by dropping them in. Fill the bowl with water so the beans are covered by 4\u20135 in (10\u201313 cm) of water. Add enough water to the bowl to fully submerge the beans.

Quick-soak your beans with boiling water if you\u2019re in a rush. To soak beans quickly, rinse the beans in a colander and then pour them into a pot. Fill the pot with enough water to submerge the beans and then heat the pot on your stove. Once the water starts to boil, turn the heat off and cover the pot.

Many cooks think that quick-soaked beans taste better, since they tend to have a firmer skin while being softer on the inside than beans that have been soaked for 24 hours. Heating Your Beans on the Stovetop Remove your beans from the fridge or pot and drain them in a colander. Take your soaked or quick-soaked beans and pour them in a colander over your sink to drain them. Shake your colander up and down a little bit to remove the excess water. Let the beans sit for 1-2 minutes so that all of the soaking water drips off. Put your beans in a clean pot with water or broth. Place your beans in a large pot. Fill the pot with water, broth, or broth concentrate. Add 1 tablespoon (15 g) of salt to the water and mix it in with a wooden spoon.

You can raise the heat towards the end of the cooking process to speed it up a little bit. Rinsing and Heating Canned Beans Open a can of pinto beans with a can opener. Take a can opener and place the circular disc on the inside rim of the can. Clamp the 2 handles down to puncture the can with the disc. Rotate the knob on the exterior side while keeping the handles clamped together to rotate the disc around the can and cut it off. If you have a manual can opener (also called a camp opener), hold the opener in your right hand. Puncture the inside rim of the can with the pointed blade. Then, turn it like your turning the ignition in a car until you\u2019ve carved around the entire can. Canned beans are already cooked, so you really only need to heat them.
