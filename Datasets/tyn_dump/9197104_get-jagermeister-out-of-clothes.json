Use 1 US quart (0.95 L) of lukewarm water, a \u00bd teaspoon of dish soap, and 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of white vinegar. Stir the mixture thoroughly. Soak the stained garment in the mixture for 15 minutes. Make sure the entire stain is submerged in the mixture. Rinse the garment under cold water. Ring out the garment and turn it inside out to get off all the vinegar and dish soap. Use a cloth to blot the stain with rubbing alcohol. Start at the center of the stain and work your way out to the edge. Don\u2019t apply too much pressure; you just want to gently lift the stain out of the garment using the cloth.

You can find a container of enzyme presoak in the laundry section of any major grocery store. If you were able to remove the stain with just the dish soap, white vinegar, and rubbing alcohol, you can skip using an enzyme presoak.

If the label on the garment says it can be washed with bleach, add chlorine bleach to the wash. Using a Stain Remover Use a cloth to blot the stain with cold water. Try to lift as much of the stain as you can using the cloth. Grab a new cloth if the first one absorbs too much liquid. If you don't have access to a cloth, use a paper towel instead. Soak the stained garment in cold water for 30 minutes. Use a bucket, sink, or tub, and make sure the stain is completely submerged in the water. Apply a pre-treatment stain remover to the stain.
