You'll be able to find latch hook kits at most arts and crafts stores, as well as hobby shops that sell knitting supplies. They typically retail for about $10 or less.

The simplest solution is to purchase precut rug yarn, which comes in pieces that are between 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) and 3 inches (7.6 cm) long. However, you can also cut each strand to the desired length yourself to give your finished project a more tailored look. 3-ply acrylic rug yarn will provide the most eye-catching results for most projects. Shop around for yarn in a variety of striking colors that you think would make a good addition to your latch hook tapestry. When cutting your own yarn, each strand should be at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) in length in order to attach securely to the canvas."

If you want to make a basic portrait-style wall hanging, arrange the canvas so that it's sitting in front of you lengthwise. To weave a landscape-style mural, turn the canvas widthwise. Clear your work area of other nearby objects to keep the canvas from getting snagged while you're working."
