There should be a large water meter attached to it that measures the amount of water that you use. The main water supply can usually be found in the garage, basement, or near your hot water heater. In warmer climates, the main water supply is sometimes located on the exterior of the house. Look for a pipe that goes from the ground to a spigot and then into the house. It may also be in a covered box near the street. If you have a home with a basement or crawlspace, the main water supply can usually be found inside on the front facing wall of the house."

Take readings from the closest water spigot, the furthest spigot, and from a washing machine connection. If there are major differences, it could indicate a leak or other plumbing problem. You can purchase a water pressure gauge at home improvement stores or online. Make sure it has a female garden hose connector.
