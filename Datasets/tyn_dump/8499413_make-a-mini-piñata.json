    "text": " Making a Simple Pi\u00f1ata Cut two 2-inch (5-centimeter) squares out of tissue paper. This will create the base of your pi\u00f1ata. Instead of whacking your pi\u00f1ata with a stick, you will pull on a tab attached to the bottom. This will break the tissue paper and release the candy. Tape a piece of ribbon onto one of the squares. Cut a piece of ribbon, preferably balloon or curling ribbon. Tape one end of the ribbon to the center of one square. Leave the other square alone for right now. For a neater finish, cut a slit into the center of the square, then slide the end of the ribbon into the slit and tape it down. Tape the square to the bottom of an empty toilet paper tube. Place the square over one end of an empty toilet paper roll. Make sure that the ribbon is sticking out. Tape each of the square's corners onto the roll. Cut a narrow strip from three different colors of tissue paper. Stack three colors of tissue paper together. Cut a few 2-inch (5-centimeter) wide strips out of the stack. The strip needs to run the entire length of the tissue paper. You will be trimming it down further later on. You can also use crepe paper or crepe paper streamers instead. Cut a 1\u00bd inch (3.81-centimeter) long fringe into the strips. Fold the strips in half several times. Cut narrow, evenly-spaced slits into one edge. Unfold and separate the strips to reveal your fringe. How narrow the slits are is up to you, but \u00bc to \u00bd inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) would be ideal. Start gluing the fringe to the toilet paper roll. Draw a line of glue around the bottom edge of the toilet paper roll. Wrap your fringe around the roll, pressing the top/smooth edge into the glue. Cut off the excess fringe and save it for the next row. The bottom of the roll is the same side that has the tissue paper square with the ribbon attached. You can also attach the tissue paper with pieces of double-sided tape. Glue your second row of fringe to the roll, overlapping the first one. Draw a line of glue around the tube, right above the first fringe. Wrap the fringed tissue paper around the tube, pressing it into the glue, then trim off the excess. The fringe will overlap the bottom one by a little. Continue gluing rows of fringe in a similar fashion. Switch colors about \u2153 of the way, and again \u2154 of the way. Each color should take up equal amounts of space on the tube. Keep working in rows until you are close to the top. Leave the last row uncovered for now. Fill the pi\u00f1ata about \u2154 of the way with candy. Choose small, lightweight candy, such as M&Ms or Skittles. Wrapped candy will also work, as long as it is lightweight. Avoid anything too heavy or sticky, and do not over-fill the tube. You want the candy to rattle inside. Cover the top of the pi\u00f1ata with the other 2-inch (5-centimeter) tissue paper square. Secure the corners with a strip of tape. Don't worry if it doesn't look perfect. You will be covering the tape up later. Add a hanging ribbon. Cut another piece of curling/balloon ribbon. Tape each end to the top of the pi\u00f1ata so that it makes a handle, like a basket. Again, don't worry about the tape showing. Add the final row of fringe around the top edge of the pi\u00f1ata. This will cover the edges of the tissue paper square and the ends of the ribbon. Making a Shaped Pi\u00f1ata Trace a simple design onto a sheet of thin cardboard. The most popular design is a donkey, but there are lots of other options too, such as: ice cream cones, doughnuts, hearts, and stars. The design should be roughly the size of your hand. Poster board works well for this. You can also use cardstock or a cereal box. Cut the design out. Use the design to trace another identical design on another thin sheet of cardboard. Cut that design out as well. You can cut it out with a pair of scissors, or you can use a craft blade for more precision. Cut a long strip of thin cardboard. The strip needs to be about 1\u00bd inches (3.8 centimeters) wide, and long enough to wrap around the perimeter of your design. If you need to, cut several strips, and tape them together. If your design has an inner shape, such as a doughnut, be sure to cut a strip out for that as well. Tape the first strip around the edges of the first shape. Place several strips of tape around the edges of your first shape, as close together as you can. Flip the shape over so that the sticky side of the tape is facing up. Wrap the thin cardboard strip around the edges of your shape. Secure it with the tabs of tape that are sticking out. If you wish to fill your pi\u00f1ata with candy, leave a 1 to 2-inch (2.5 to 5-centimeter) gap in the bottom of the pi\u00f1ata. If your pi\u00f1ata has a pointy bottom, make the gap on the side. If you wish to add a hanging cord, poke a hole in the center of the top wall. Fold some cord in half and knot the ends. Push the folded end up through the hole so that the knots are on the inside. Tape the second shape on top. Place several strips of tape around the edges of the second shape, as close together as you can. Place it tape-side-down on top of the first one. Fold the pieces of tape onto the side walls made by the thin cardboard strip. Fill the pi\u00f1ata with candy, if desired. If you plan on using the pi\u00f1ata as decoration, you do not have to fill it with candy. Choose wrapped, lightweight candy. Hard, non-sticky candy, such as M&Ms and Skittles may also work. Avoid anything that is too heavy or bulky, and do not over-stuff your pi\u00f1ata; you want the candy to rattle inside. Cover the gap if you filled your pi\u00f1ata with candy. If you filled your pi\u00f1ata with candy, you will have a gap in the bottom that needs to be covered up. Cut a 3 by 1\u00bd inch (7.62 by 3.8-centimeter) piece of tissue paper or crepe paper. Place it over the gap, and secure the edges with tape or glue. Cut 1-inch (2.5-centimeter) wide strips out of tissue paper or crepe paper. The strip needs to run the entire length of the tissue paper. Don't worry if it looks too long; you will be trimming it down later on. You can also use crepe paper streamers instead. For a more interesting-looking pi\u00f1ata, use at least two different colors; three would be even better. Cut a \u00be inch (1.91-centimeter) deep fringe into one edge of the tissue paper strip. Fold the strip in half several times first, then cut several, evenly-spaced slits into one of the edges. Unfold the strip to reveal your fringe. How wide these slits are is up to you, but \u00bc inch (0.64 centimeter) would be ideal. Glue your first row of fringe to the bottom edge of the pi\u00f1ata. Draw a line of glue around the bottom edge of the pi\u00f1ata. Wrap the fringe around the pi\u00f1ata, pressing the top/smooth part of the fringe into the glue. If you don't plan on breaking your pi\u00f1ata apart, you can use double-sided tape instead. Continue gluing the fringe to the pi\u00f1ata, overlapping each row. Apply your next line of glue just above the first fringe. Press the second strip of fringe into the glue, so that the tassel part covers the smooth part. Apply tissue paper to the top and bottom of your pi\u00f1ata. Depending on the shape you created, your pi\u00f1ata may still have bare patches on the top and bottom walls. Cover these patches with 1\u00bd-inch (3.8-centimeter) wide strips of tissue paper. Do not add fringes to these. Consider adding additional shapes with cut construction paper or cardstock. You do not have to do this, but you can make your pi\u00f1ata look more interesting by gluing cut paper on top of the fringe. Cut some shapes out of construction paper or cardstock, then glue them to the pi\u00f1ata. Do not get carried away here, however; less is more! Finished. ",

        "Making a Shaped Pi\u00f1ata Trace a simple design onto a sheet of thin cardboard.",
        "The most popular design is a donkey, but there are lots of other options too, such as: ice cream cones, doughnuts, hearts, and stars.",
        "The design should be roughly the size of your hand.",
        "Poster board works well for this.",
        "You can also use cardstock or a cereal box.",
        "Cut the design out.",
        "Use the design to trace another identical design on another thin sheet of cardboard.",
        "Cut that design out as well.",
        "You can cut it out with a pair of scissors, or you can use a craft blade for more precision.",
        "Cut a long strip of thin cardboard.",
        "The strip needs to be about 1\u00bd inches (3.8 centimeters) wide, and long enough to wrap around the perimeter of your design.",
        "If you need to, cut several strips, and tape them together.",
        "If your design has an inner shape, such as a doughnut, be sure to cut a strip out for that as well.",
        "Tape the first strip around the edges of the first shape.",
        "Place several strips of tape around the edges of your first shape, as close together as you can.",
        "Flip the shape over so that the sticky side of the tape is facing up.",
        "Wrap the thin cardboard strip around the edges of your shape.",
        "Secure it with the tabs of tape that are sticking out.",
        "If you wish to fill your pi\u00f1ata with candy, leave a 1 to 2-inch (2.5 to 5-centimeter) gap in the bottom of the pi\u00f1ata.",
        "If your pi\u00f1ata has a pointy bottom, make the gap on the side.",
        "If you wish to add a hanging cord, poke a hole in the center of the top wall.",
        "Fold some cord in half and knot the ends.",
        "Push the folded end up through the hole so that the knots are on the inside.",
        "Tape the second shape on top.",
        "Place several strips of tape around the edges of the second shape, as close together as you can.",
        "Place it tape-side-down on top of the first one.",
        "Fold the pieces of tape onto the side walls made by the thin cardboard strip.",
        "Fill the pi\u00f1ata with candy, if desired.",
        "If you plan on using the pi\u00f1ata as decoration, you do not have to fill it with candy.",
        "Choose wrapped, lightweight candy.",
        "Hard, non-sticky candy, such as M&Ms and Skittles may also work.",
        "Avoid anything that is too heavy or bulky, and do not over-stuff your pi\u00f1ata; you want the candy to rattle inside.",
        "Cover the gap if you filled your pi\u00f1ata with candy.",
        "If you filled your pi\u00f1ata with candy, you will have a gap in the bottom that needs to be covered up.",
        "Cut a 3 by 1\u00bd inch (7.62 by 3.8-centimeter) piece of tissue paper or crepe paper.",
        "Place it over the gap, and secure the edges with tape or glue.",
        "Cut 1-inch (2.5-centimeter) wide strips out of tissue paper or crepe paper.",
        "The strip needs to run the entire length of the tissue paper.",
        "Don't worry if it looks too long; you will be trimming it down later on.",
        "You can also use crepe paper streamers instead.",
        "For a more interesting-looking pi\u00f1ata, use at least two different colors; three would be even better.",
        "Cut a \u00be inch (1.91-centimeter) deep fringe into one edge of the tissue paper strip.",
        "Fold the strip in half several times first, then cut several, evenly-spaced slits into one of the edges.",
        "Unfold the strip to reveal your fringe.",
        "How wide these slits are is up to you, but \u00bc inch (0.64 centimeter) would be ideal.",
        "Glue your first row of fringe to the bottom edge of the pi\u00f1ata.",
        "Draw a line of glue around the bottom edge of the pi\u00f1ata.",
        "Wrap the fringe around the pi\u00f1ata, pressing the top/smooth part of the fringe into the glue.",
        "If you don't plan on breaking your pi\u00f1ata apart, you can use double-sided tape instead.",
        "Continue gluing the fringe to the pi\u00f1ata, overlapping each row.",
        "Apply your next line of glue just above the first fringe.",
        "Press the second strip of fringe into the glue, so that the tassel part covers the smooth part.",
        "Apply tissue paper to the top and bottom of your pi\u00f1ata.",
        "Depending on the shape you created, your pi\u00f1ata may still have bare patches on the top and bottom walls.",
        "Cover these patches with 1\u00bd-inch (3.8-centimeter) wide strips of tissue paper.",
        "Do not add fringes to these.",
        "Consider adding additional shapes with cut construction paper or cardstock.",
        "You do not have to do this, but you can make your pi\u00f1ata look more interesting by gluing cut paper on top of the fringe.",
        "Cut some shapes out of construction paper or cardstock, then glue them to the pi\u00f1ata.",
        "Do not get carried away here, however; less is more!",
        "Finished."
