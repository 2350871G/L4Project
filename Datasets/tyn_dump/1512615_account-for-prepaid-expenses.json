Quite simply, in accrual-based accounting, revenues are reported on the income statement when they are earned, not when the cash is received. For example, if you provide a service worth $1,000 in June, and do not receive the cash for the service until August, the income will be reported on the income statement as $1,000 of revenues in June. In August, the income statement would show no revenues (assuming there were no other revenues from the business). This is because you earned the revenues in June. This differs from cash-based accounting, whereby the revenues are recorded when the cash itself is provided, not when the revenues are earned."

Common examples of pre-paid expenses include insurance premiums, rent, and any business contracts that require payment in advance. For example, with insurance, you may pay your premium six months in advance (which is common). Then, over a period of six months, that premium will be \"used\"."

As an example, if you are paying rent six months in advance, the pre-paid expense would not be recorded in the month when you send the check to the landlord.

In this case, every month for the six month period, one sixth of the total rent amount will appear on the income statement.
