The suede brush will also help lift the nap on your suede, which will make it easier to get your boots completely clean. You can buy a suede cleaning kit from most big-box stores, shoe stores, or specialty leather shops. Typically, they come with a suede brush, a rubber eraser, and suede cleaner. The kit may also contain a sponge. Ugg also sells its own cleaning and conditioning kit."

        "You can also combine baking soda and cornstarch, if you\u2019d like.",
        "Shake out the excess powder before you wear the shoes.",
        "Preventing Stains and Damage Treat your shoes with a protective suede spray when you first get them.",
        "The best way to keep your Ugg boots looking fresh and new is to protect them from stains in the first place.",
        "Take your boots outdoors or to a well-ventilated area, then hold the can about 6 in (15 cm) away from the boots and spray them evenly.",
        "Wet the surface well, but do not soak the boots, then leave them in a cool, ventilated area for at least 24 hours.",
        "Once the boots are dry, brush them with a suede brush to lift the pile.",
        "You can purchase suede protector from a big-box store, leather shop, or directly from Ugg.",
        "Avoid storing your shoes near direct heat or sunlight.",
        "Sunlight and heat can damage suede, causing it to discolor, shrink, and crack.",
        "Do not keep your Ugg boots in front of a heater or near a window where they\u2019ll be exposed to full sunlight.",
        "For instance, if your heater vent blows in a certain corner of your room, you wouldn\u2019t want to store your boots there.",
        "Avoid wearing your shoes in deep water or snow.",
        "Although Ugg boots are very warm and are popular in the wintertime, they are not made to be weatherproof.",
        "If you\u2019re wearing your Uggs and it\u2019s raining or snowing, try not to walk through deep puddles or drifts of snow.",
        "If you do wear them when it\u2019s rainy or snowy out, wipe off your boots with a damp cloth as soon as possible, and leave them to dry naturally.",
        "Icy streets are often treated with salt.",
        "Since salt will leave stubborn stains that are difficult to remove without discoloring your shoes, it\u2019s especially important to wipe them down as soon as possible if you\u2019ve worn them in icy weather.",
        "Clean dried mud and dirt off of your boots as soon as possible.",
        "Just like any other material, the longer a stain sits on suede, the harder it will be to get out.",
        "If you get dirt or mud on your shoes, let it dry completely, then dust it away with your suede brush as soon as possible.",
        "If you need to, wash your shoes with suede cleaner and a damp sponge to get rid of any residue.",
        "Allow your boots to air-dry after you clean them."
