Starting a Siphon by Submersion Position your bucket. The bucket may be placed anywhere, so long as the top of the bucket is below the bottom of the tank.

When you have removed enough water, you can stop the water flow by raising the discharge end to a point slightly higher than the aquarium. You will need to flood the vacuum and tube again if additional siphoning needs to be performed. Starting a Siphon With Your Mouth Position your bucket. Another method for starting a siphon it to you use your mouth to initiate the suction. To accomplish this, first place your bucket on a surface lower than your fish tank. Position the tube. Next, place the vacuum end (larger opening) of your tube at the bottom of your fish tank. Keep the vacuum end a few inches above the gravel, unless you have a gravel vacuum attached.

Ensure that the end of the tube is lower than the container from which you are siphoning water. Direct the water into the bucket. As soon as the water begins to flow, quickly remove your mouth and place the discharge opening into your bucket. Then simply allow the water to flow. Move the vacuum end of the tube around the tank to suck up dirt and debris. Stop the flow. When enough water has been removed, lift the discharge end of the tube so that it is higher than the fish tank. This will stop the flow of water.
