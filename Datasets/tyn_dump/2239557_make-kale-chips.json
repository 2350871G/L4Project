        "Toss the kale leaves with the spice mixture.",
        "Transfer the mixture from the blender to the bowl of kale leaves.",
        "Use your hands to toss the kale with the spice mixture so that it gets evenly distributed.",
        "You can use a spoon to mix everything together if you prefer, just make sure all of the kale pieces end up coated in the spice mixture.",
        "Scatter the kale in a single layer on a baking sheet.",
        "Be sure to spread the pieces out evenly and don\u2019t allow any of the pieces to touch to ensure crispiness.",
        "If necessary, use 2 baking sheets and bake your chips in batches.",

        "Bake them for several minutes and take them out when they look golden brown and crispy around the edges.",
        "Let the chips cool for several minutes and enjoy!",
        "The chips will be very hot, so give them a few minutes to cool down before you dig in.",
        "They are best enjoyed fresh right away, but if you have leftovers, transfer them to an airtight container and store them at room temperature for 2-3 days.",
        "After the first 24 hours, the kale chips will lose a lot of their crispy texture, so keep that in mind when you\u2019re storing leftovers."
