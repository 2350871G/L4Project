The center leaflet is slightly taller than the 2 on the sides, and the leaves\u2019 color will change according to the season. The plant can grow as a vine or a bush, and may also have clusters of hard, white berry-like fruit. The leaves will turn reddish in the spring, green in the summer, and yellow or orange in the fall. Beyond those main characteristics, poison ivy plants can also vary slightly. For example, they may have smooth or jagged edges, and their texture can either look glossy or dull. When in doubt, avoid any plants that have the 3-leaf compound."

        "Leave the sheet mulch on for a full season so it can function as a barrier, preventing any new poison ivy plants, while simultaneously rejuvenating the soil.",
        "To add an even stronger barrier, place cardboard underneath the sheet mulch or a layer of  plywood over top of the sheet mulch.",
        "For example, you could cover the affected area with several layers of cardboard, then top it with about 1 foot (0.30 m) of mulch.",
