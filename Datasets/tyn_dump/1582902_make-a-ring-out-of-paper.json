Try gold or silver foil paper to make the ring look even more like it\u2019s made out of metal. You can find such foil online or in many craft and even some department stores. A standard piece of paper at 8 by 11.5 inches will work, although people have made paper rings out of smaller squares, even post-it-notes! Use colored paper if you want to make your ring colorful. Really, though, any piece of paper would work. You could even make a paper ring out of a regular piece of lined notebook paper. You could also try using special Origami paper, which is the Japanese art of paper folding. Try washi or chiyogami, which comes in different colors and designs. This paper, which can be purchased online, is used to make Origami paper designs."
