                    "description": "Go for a color that complements your skin tone and personality, and stay away from anything too brash to avoid disappointment. If you are dyeing your hair at home, it is better to stay with a darker shade. A blonde or dramatically different shade can be difficult to achieve without the help of a stylist, and dyeing it improperly can leave hair very damaged. If your hair has been relaxed, then it is best to go to a professional. If you don't want to go to a professional, it's best to stick to temporary dyes. Choose a color that is within two to four shades of your natural hair color. Choosing blonde when your hair is naturally dark can result in a shade of orange."

                    "description": "You have the option of choosing a permanent, semi-permanent, or temporary dye. A semi-permanent dye is probably the better option because it isn\u2019t as harsh and doesn\u2019t last as long. A temporary dye doesn\u2019t penetrate the strands, and it will wash out within a few washes. Choosing a semi-permanent dye can also be healthier for your hair because natural hair coloring options, like henna, are available with semi-permanent hair color. The longer your hair, the more boxes you'll need. If your hair is long, it's best to buy at least two boxes of color to be sure that you will have enough dye. If you have short hair, you should need just one box. Henna is a great choice for natural, virgin hair. But, if you\u2019re hair has already been chemically treated, then henna can damage your hair. It is possible to apply dye to locs."
