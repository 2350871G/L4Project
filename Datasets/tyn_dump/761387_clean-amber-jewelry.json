Edward Lewand\t\t\tGraduate Gemologist & Accredited Appraiser\t\t\t\tBe gentle when you're cleaning the amber. Amber is a very soft material, so you have to be really careful when you're cleaning it. Amber is made of resin, and you can damage the stone if you use a harsh cleaner or anything abrasive on it. Also, don't allow amber to soak in any kind of cleaning solution, as it can damage the stone."
