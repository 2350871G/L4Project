The following directions may be similar to those on the package:\nPour 2 cups (473ml) of water into a small saucepan. Add a stick of dried brown sugar to the water or approximately 1/4 cup (47g) of brown sugar. Stir until dissolved. Heat to a boil. The sugar will make the boba taste better. You can also add simple syrup to the boba while they are cooling. Add 1/4 cup (38g) of dried tapioca pearls to the water. Stir until they float on the top of the water. This can take up to 2 minutes of sitting in the boiling water. Turn the heat down to medium. Heat the boba for an additional 12 to 15 minutes. Then, remove the pan from heat, cover them and allow them to sit for another 12 minutes. You can now begin mixing your remaining ingredients for the tea."
