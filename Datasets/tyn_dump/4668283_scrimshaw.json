A small, sharp scribing tool or needle will give you the best means of making controlled, precise etches onto your piece of ivory. You can also use a pen-like X-acto knife with a replaceable head if you don\u2019t have access to a pin vise. Insert a pin into the front and secure the pinhead inside the knife.

        "This is technically not required, since you could also draw your design by hand.",
        "However, unless you\u2019re experienced in this kind of art, it\u2019s much harder to make precise outlines on such a small surface by hand.",
        "Print the image or copy it to a sheet of paper.",
        "You\u2019ll have to copy your image to a sheet of paper if you weren\u2019t able to find a digital version of your design.",
        "In either case, have a copy of your design on a sheet of paper that you can place overtop of your piece of ivory.",
        "If you have to copy your image by hand, make sure draw it so that it\u2019s about the size of the surface area of the object you\u2019re working on.",
        "Cut the design out of this sheet of paper in the shape of your object.",
        "Place the ivory or bone on top of the design on the sheet of paper and draw an outline of the object over it.",
        "Then, cut out this outline so that you can easily place your design on top of the object.",
        "Place the cutout of your design on the ivory and use a cloth to transfer it.",
        "Lay your design face-down on top of your bone or ivory object.",
        "Then, wet a cloth with acetone nail polish remover and rub the back of the cutout with it very slightly.",
        "Continue doing this until the acetone has soaked through the paper.Tip: If you don\u2019t have nail polish remover, you can also trace your design onto the object by using your scribing tool to poke through the paper along the lines of your design.",
        "Just make sure that you hold the paper in the exact same way against the object throughout this process.",
        "Lift up the edge of the paper and peel it back quickly.",
        "You don\u2019t want to move it around on the surface, or it will smudge your outline.",
        "Discard the paper once you\u2019re done with it.",
        "If the outline didn\u2019t come off onto the bone clearly enough, use sandpaper to \u201cerase\u201d the etching.",
        "Then, wax the surface of your object and start the transferring process again.",
        "Etching Etch the outlines of the illustration with your pin or scribing tool.",
        "Begin applying pressure to the bone while holding the pin as vertical as possible.",
        "This will create a tiny dot in the surface.",
        "Repeat this process to create multiple little dots along the outline of your illustration.",
        "The dots will be close enough to each other to give the appearance of a rough dotted outline of your design.",
        "Be sure to replace your pin as necessary if it begins to dull.Tip: Dotting the surface this way is a method called \u201cstipple\u201d scrimshaw.",
        "Etch the most difficult parts of the design next.",
        "The most difficult parts of a design, such as the eyes or face of a person, are where the artist is most likely to make a mistake.",
        "This way, by doing these parts first, you\u2019ll only have to sand off a little bit of the ivory if you make a mistake.",
        "If you make a mistake in your etching, the way to \u201cfix\u201d it is to use sandpaper and sand away the surface of the bone until your etching is gone.",
        "Then, start the etching process over again.",
        "Place dots especially close together to create shaded areas.",
        "If there are any parts of your design that need to be darker than other parts, place the dots much closer together in these areas.",
        "This will create a much darker appearance later on when you add ink to the design.",
        "For example, if your dots are all about 1 centimetre (0.39 in) apart, then placing dots in one area only about 0.5 centimetres (0.20 in) apart will make that area noticeably darker than the surrounding surface when you go to ink it.",
        "Continue etching the design to complete the outline of the illustration.",
        "Check to see if there are any visible mistakes or places that still need to be etched.",
        "Don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t see all the mistakes right now; you\u2019ll be better able to spot them once you apply ink to the surface.",
        "Inking and Preserving Use a cotton swab to apply ink to the surface of your object.",
        "Dip your cotton swab into the ink and use a swirling motion to spread a generous amount onto the surface of the ivory.",
        "Wait 10-15 seconds for the ink to dry.",
        "Then, use a lint-free rag or cloth to quickly wipe the ink off of the surface.",
        "For best results, use squid ink or India ink to fill in your etches.",
        "You can also use colored varieties of ink if they\u2019re available at your local art supply store.",
        "Some small amounts of ink will be left inside the dots that you etched into the surface.",
        "This will give you a good indication of what your scrimshaw art will look like when you\u2019re done.",
        "Re-etch any areas that you want to be darker and apply more ink.",
        "If there are any spots where you want your image to be darker or your lines to be smoother, simply use your scribing tool or pin to etch those spots a bit deeper or place more dots along the lines.",
        "Then, use another cotton swab to re-apply ink to those areas.",
        "Finally, use a clean area of your lint-free rag to wipe the ink off again.",
        "Repeat this process as necessary to finish creating your image.",
        "Use a clean, lint-free cloth to wipe the extra ink off of the surface.",
        "The process of applying ink to your etched design will probably have left the rest of your ivory or bone dark and swirly.",
        "Luckily, all you need to do is rub these areas with a clean cloth to get all this ink off.",
        "Re-apply beeswax to your piece twice a year to preserve it.",
        "This will help to maintain your scrimshaw\u2019s shine and glossiness, especially if it\u2019s made of real ivory.",
        "For best results, use Renaissance Wax or warm beeswax when polishing your piece.",
        "Note that this is most important for works made of real ivory, but you should still do this at least once a year no matter what material your scrimshaw is made of."
