A large, white garbage bag is the best option, as it is durable and easy to decorate. You can also use strong white contact paper or newspaper. Fabric can also work for the sail in a pinch, though it should be thick and sturdy so the sail is strong. Lay the frame on the sail. Spread the material you are using for the sail flat on the ground.

Use scissors to cut out the diamond, leaving a bit of space around the outline so you can wrap the sail to the frame easily. You should now have a nice, clean diamond sail that can fit snugly over the frame. Assembling the Kite Fold the edge of the sail over the frame and glue and tape it down. Run a thin line of super glue on the frame and press the edge of the sail on the frame to keep it in place. You can also use masking tape or electrical tape to secure the sail to the frame, taping the edge onto the inside of the sail.

Use thick string or a strip of cloth for the tail. Pick a string or cloth color that matches the color of your sail so your kite looks pretty in the air. Attach pieces of cloth or ribbon to the tail at 1 foot (0.30 m) intervals. Use pieces that are 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) long. Tie them onto the tail with a small knot, allowing them to dangle down off the string. The cloth or ribbon pieces will help the tail stay balanced and ensure the kite flies straight.
