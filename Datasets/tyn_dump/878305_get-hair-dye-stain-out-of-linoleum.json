Begin by using a clean cloth to blot at the hair dye stain. Use gentle up and down tapping motions, and avoid rubbing or spreading the hair dye around, as this can stain an even larger area of your linoleum floor. Blot until hair dye stops lifting. Once you have absorbed most of the excess hair dye that is sitting on top of the stain, wet another clean cloth and continue blotting at the hair dye stain. Keep blotting until no more stain is being lifted. Fill a bucket with soapy water. Fill a large bucket with warm water, then add a squirt of all purpose cleaner. Swirl the water around so that the water and soap mix. Scrub the stain with a magic eraser. Dip a Mr. Clean magic eraser into the soapy water, then begin to scrub at the stain.
