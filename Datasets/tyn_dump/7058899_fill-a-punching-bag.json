A lighter punching bag that\u2019s less dense will sway more when you hit it, and you won\u2019t have to hit it as hard. The right filling you should use will depend on how heavy and dense you want your punching bag to be. If you\u2019re new to boxing, start out with a lightweight punching bag. You can add more filling to make it heavier and denser as you get stronger. Generally, your punching bag should weigh around 0.5 pounds (0.23 kg) per 1 pound (0.45 kg) you weigh. However, you can increase or decrease the weight depending on your experience level and physical strength."
