Always maintain a distance of 4 inches (10 cm) between a can of compressed air and any computer components inside the computer case. Remove any large particles or dust balls using a pair of tweezers. Avoid direct contact with components, cables and wires as much as possible. Use a can of compressed air to blow out small particles from around each component inside the case. Be sure to maintain the recommended distance of 4 inches (10 cm) between the nozzle of the can and any part of the computer. Blow out any dust or debris that collected around each fan installed, including the case fans, the power supply fan and the CPU fan. The CPU fan will typically be mounted on a heat-sink that sits on top of the CPU, often located on or near the middle of the computer's motherboard. Refer to the operating instructions that came with your computer for a detailed diagram of the location of the CPU fan. Hold a cotton swab between the fan blades to prevent the fan from moving while using the compressed air. Once each of the fans and components have been thoroughly cleaned, use the compressed air to clean out the layer of dust and debris that accumulates along the bottom of the tower during the cleaning process.
