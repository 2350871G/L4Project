Opt for cotton if you want your skirt to be slightly more structured or go with jersey for a skirt that has some stretch and movement. You can also opt for a sheer fabric, but you\u2019ll need to wear leggings or a slip under it. Tip: Avoid fabrics that are very stiff, such as leather, vinyl, and denim. These are harder to sew."

                    "description": "Hold 1 end of the measuring tape and wrap the other end around your waist. Pull the measuring tape so that it\u2019s snug around your waist and check the measurement. Then, multiply the measurement by 1.5. This is an easy way to determine how wide you\u2019ll need to cut the fabric for your skirt. Another option is to wrap the fabric around your waist 1.5 times and mark where this length ends. For example, if your waist is 30 in (76 cm), then multiplying that number by 1.5 would give you 45 in (110 cm)."

Then, add 2 in (5.1 cm) to this measurement and to the waist multiplied by 1.5. The 2 in (5.1 cm) will provide extra fabric for the seam allowances. Use a sharp pair of scissors to cut the fabric to these dimensions. For example, if the waist times 1.5 is 45 in (110 cm), then adding 2 in (5.1 cm) gives you 47 in (120 cm). If you want the skirt to be 26 in (66 cm) long, then adding 2 in (5.1 cm) gives you 28 in (71 cm). This means that you\u2019d need to cut the fabric to 47 in (120 cm) by 28 in (71 cm)."

This is an easy way to determine how wide you\u2019ll need to cut the fabric for your skirt. Another option is to wrap the fabric around your waist 1.5 times and mark where this length ends. For example, if your waist is 30 in (76 cm), then multiplying that number by 1.5 would give you 45 in (110 cm). Cut the fabric to the desired dimensions of your skirt plus 2 in (5.1 cm). Measure against your leg to decide how long you want the skirt to be and use this as your other measurement. Then, add 2 in (5.1 cm) to this measurement and to the waist multiplied by 1.5. The 2 in (5.1 cm) will provide extra fabric for the seam allowances. Use a sharp pair of scissors to cut the fabric to these dimensions. For example, if the waist times 1.5 is 45 in (110 cm), then adding 2 in (5.1 cm) gives you 47 in (120 cm). If you want the skirt to be 26 in (66 cm) long, then adding 2 in (5.1 cm) gives you 28 in (71 cm). This means that you\u2019d need to cut the fabric to 47 in (120 cm) by 28 in (71 cm). Cut a 5 in (13 cm) wide rectangle 3 times your waist measurement for the waistband. This will ensure that you\u2019ll have plenty of fabric for the waistband.

For example, if your waist measurement was 38 in (97 cm), then you\u2019ll need a 5 in (13 cm) wide strip that is 114 in (290 cm) long. Folding the Fabric Fold the waistband piece in half lengthwise. Lay the waistband piece on a flat surface with the wrong (back) side of the fabric facing up.

Repeat this for both sides of the skirt and the top edge, but don\u2019t worry about the bottom edge yet. Attaching the Waistband Sew a straight stitch to hem the side of the skirt piece. Once you have folded the edges of the skirt, take the fabric to the sewing machine and place it under the presser foot. Sew a straight stitch along each of these edges to secure the folded fabric. Make sure to remove the pins as you sew. Don\u2019t sew over the pins or you may damage your machine. Locate the center of the waistband and top edge of the skirt. Fold the waistband in half so that the ends are lined up. Then, insert a pin to indicate the center of the waistband.

Secure the folded edge of the skirt with pins and then sew a straight stitch along the folded edge. Remove the pins as you sew to avoid damaging your sewing machine.
