        "Use a pearl trim for a more elegant touch.",
        "Make sure that the pearls have a flat back; they will be easier to glue on than spherical pearls.",
        "Use a variety of rhinestones if you want more texture.",
        "Apply the glue to a small patch on the bottle.",
        "Lay down the bigger rhinestones first, then fill in the gaps with small and medium-sized ones.",
        "Finish each patch before starting on the next.",
        "Avoid placing 2 rhinestones of the same color, shape, and size next to each other.",
        "You don't have to let the glue dry and cure completely before moving onto the next patch.",
        "About 10 to 15 minutes should be enough.",
        "The size of the patches doesn't really matter.",
        "Plan on working on 5 to 7 rhinestones at a time, however.",
        "Use some non-rhinestone gems for even more texture, such as pearls.",
        "Let the bottle dry before adding details or gifting it.",
        "How long the bottle takes to dry depends on the type of glue you used.",
        "Some glues will have a curing time in addition to a drying time, so check the label on your bottle or tube of glue.",
        "In most cases, expect to wait 1 to 2 days for the glue to set.",
        "Adding Optional Details Outline labels with rhinestone trim for a fancier touch.",
        "Apply the glue and trim to 1 side of the label at a time.",
        "If you are decorating the front label, consider doing 3 rows of rhinestone trim.",
        "Use a thin trim for the first and third rows, and a larger trim for the middle row.",
        "Use a thin, simple trim for the back label.",
        "You don't have to use rhinestones for the middle row.",
        "Try pearls or even studs!",
        "Glue large, fancy rhinestones over round stamps or seals.",
        "Some bottles have a round stamp or seal near the top, right between the neck and label.",
        "Choose a large rhinestone, then glue it right over the stamp or seal.",
        "Glue 1 to 2 rows of tiny rhinestones around the larger one for a fancier look.",
        "The large rhinestone should be large enough to cover the stamp or seal.",
        "For more variation, use tiny pearls for the first row, and silver rhinestones for the second row.",
        "Break up monotony and add texture with glitter.",
        "If all of your rhinestones are the same shape, size, and color, your bottle may look monotonous.",
        "Give the bottle a quick coat of a clear-drying glue or spray sealer, then shake some glitter onto it.",
        "This works especially well over smooth, pearl trims.",
        "If you are using spray sealer, it must be glossy, or you will dull down the rhinestones.",
        "Use glitter that is the same color as your rhinestones to help blend it in some more.",
        "Extra-fine glitter will look pretty, but you can use chunky glitter instead, or even a combination of both!",
        "Layer larger gems and rhinestones over tiny ones.",
        "If you covered your entire bottle with rhinestones, it may look a little monotonous.",
        "Let the bottle dry first, then add larger rhinestones, gemstones, or flat-backed pearls on top.",
        "Use these sparingly; do not cover the entire bottle with these.",
        "This works especially well over a pearl trim.",
        "The rhinestones will help add some texture.",
        "Add an accessory, such as a bow, if desired.",
        "Cut a length of ribbon and tie it into a bow.",
        "Glue the bow to the neck of bottle, then cut the tails of the bow into angles.",
        "Glue a fancy gemstone or brooch to the center of the bow for a more detailed touch."
