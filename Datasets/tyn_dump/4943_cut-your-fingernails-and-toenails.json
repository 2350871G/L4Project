Consider the pros and cons of each option:\nNail clippers are cheap, simple, and widely available.

Toenail clippers usually feature a heavier bite and a straighter edge to contend with thicker nails and the risk of ingrown toenails. Manicure scissors are less common than nail clippers, but some people greatly prefer them. You may need somewhat more finesse to trim your nails with manicure scissors. However, you also have more control over the arc of the cut. As their name suggests, manicure scissors are usually best-suited to hand care. You'll want to use a heavier-duty set of clippers on your feet. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Health Resources and Services Administration says that it is too dangerous to use other sharp cutting tools\u2014such as knives, razor blades, or regular scissors\u2014to trim your nails. The tool may slip and injure the skin surrounding the nail."
