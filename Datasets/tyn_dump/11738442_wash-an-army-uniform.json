This process applies to basically every branch of the military, although you should always refer to your military handbook for specific directions regarding special uniforms.

                    "description": "You do not need a lot of laundry detergent to clean your uniform. Add 1\u20132 teaspoons (4.9\u20139.9 mL) of detergent based on how dirty your uniform is. This is usually 1/5-1/4 of a cap if you\u2019re measuring the detergent out by eye.Warning: Never use bleach, specialty cleaners, or brightening agents. Combat uniforms are usually treated with permethrin, which kills lice, mites, and other pests you may encounter when you\u2019re on duty.

Turn your washing machine on and let it run until the cycle is finished. Unless you have a lot of time on your hands, hand-washing a combat uniform isn\u2019t really an option.

Use a plastic or wood hanger to hang your shirt, and hang the pants on the bottom bar of a separate hanger. Wait 2-4 hours for your uniform to dry. Never use cornstarch or an iron. The compounds in cornstarch and the heat from an iron will destroy the permethrin in your uniform. If your uniform is wrinkled and you\u2019re in a pinch, hang it in the bathroom and turn the shower on and turn the handle to make the water as hot as possible.
