And if there are people you still want to invite that you don't have parts for, either write a new character into the plot or cast them an extra."

No big deal. When your friends come ask them to bring any Star Wars costumes they might have, as well toy laser guns or plastic lightsabers. Whatever you need. And if there's costumes that nobody has, you can get used clothes really cheap at secondhand stores and make them into costumes. Improvise!"

Nobody pays that much attention to the extras, or what they're wearing. But they do add color and texture and interest. So if there's a friend who's not playing a big part, or somebody who's not in that particular scene, throw a wig on them and have them walk around behind the main characters. Bike helmets work well for extras."
