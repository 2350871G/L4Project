Class 2 SLMs are slightly less accurate, but still suitable for most general sound level measurement purposes. Anything less than a class 2 SLM is not considered accurate for anything more than rough measurements. Both class 1 and class 2 SLMs can be used to take things like workplace noise, community noise, industrial noise, and other commercial or residential noise measurements. Keep in mind that class 1 SLMs are the most expensive. Though class 3 SLMs are not considered accurate enough for most noise measurement purposes, it is acceptable to use one to take a rough preliminary measurement that lets you know if you need to take a more precise measurement with a class 1 or class 2 SLM. The easiest place to find a sound level meter to purchase is online. Class 2 meters start at around $150 USD and class 1 meters start around $350 USD."

Look up a manual for your SLM model by brand and name on a search engine to find exact calibration instructions. For example, some SLMs come with an acoustic calibrator that you mount over the microphone to calibrate the meter. It emits a constant sound level, typically 93dB, for the microphone to read in order to calibrate itself."

A-weighted decibels are modified based on audio frequency to compensate for the way the human ear hears sound. Common Noises and Their Sound Levels:\n40dB: Quiet conversation volume.50dB: Average conversation volume.60dB: Quiet traffic noise.80dB: Loud traffic noise at close range.100dB: Noise from a jackhammer at close range. For instance, a 100dB sound pressure level at 100 hertz (Hz) would be heard by the human ear at the same loudness as 80dB at a 1000Hz frequency. A-weighted decibel readings give you a more accurate interpretation of how your hearing may be affected by noise at different frequencies by telling you at what volume your ears hear the sound, rather than just the overall loudness. Keep in mind that noise levels higher than 85dB can start to damage the human ear after 8 hours of listening. Noise levels of 100dB can damage your hearing after just 15 minutes."
