Therefore, if you are stopped by the police, the officers are not permitted to search your car if doing so would be considered \u201cunreasonable.\u201d Usually, an officer may search your car if they have a search warrant or have probable cause to search. Otherwise, you can say \u201cno\u201d when a police officer asks to search your car. Since officers cannot always legally search, you should know when you are allowed to say that you do not consent to a search. If the officer sees any illegal objects in plain view, he or she can search the part of the vehicle that the objects are in and arrest you if necessary. For example, if you have drugs in the passenger compartment of your car, an officer who sees the drugs can search the whole passenger compartment of the car. Keep in mind that in the United States, moving vehicles are subject by law enforcement to search with probable cause after a traffic stop. Probable cause may include observing occupants in suspicious activities and things that the officer can smell, see, or hear, such as safety violations, open containers, and items that could potentially appear to be weapons. Once an officer has probable cause, your entire vehicle is subject to search. An officer may also search a vehicle if given permission. However, if an officer asks you for permission to search your vehicle, you do not have to say yes. Refusing to give consent for a search cannot be used by the officer as probable cause to search your vehicle. However, if you do say no to a search, the officer may try to establish probable cause for the search by asking more questions and closely inspecting the areas of the vehicle that are in plain view.

If you are stopped and you believe that the officers are profiling you for any reason, continue to cooperate with the officers and call a lawyer as soon as you can. React calmly at a roadblock. If you are stopped at a roadblock, you should act the same way as you would have if you had been pulled over for a traffic violation. If law enforcement officers have set up a roadblock, they can stop every vehicle and ask for documentation or request that every individual take a sobriety test, road side breath test or drug check. In this situation, you cannot refuse to take the sobriety test without being arrested. While the officers do not have probable cause to suspect that you have been drinking, they do not need it in this situation because they are testing everyone. Be aware of traps. Sometimes, the police will set up a roadblock and not stop anyone. Instead, they will see who diverts and gets off the road at an exit right before the roadblock. If the police see you get off the road at an exit right before a roadblock, they may stop you. Avoiding a roadblock is probable cause for the police to stop you. However, because the police are not stopping you for the specific purpose of the roadblock (i.e. drinking), they may ask you why you avoided the roadblock without automatically asking you to take a sobriety test. Getting Stopped While Walking Understand how a \"stop and frisk\" works. If a police officer has a \"reasonable suspicion\" that criminal activity is occurring, the officer can perform a \"stop and frisk.\" A stop is a brief detention short of an arrest, and a frisk is a pat-down to check for weapons. Both the stop and the frisk must be justified by the circumstances to be legal. \"Reasonable suspicion\" is a lower standard than \"probable cause. \"A stop is a briefer detention than an arrest, and a frisk is less invasive than a search. However, if the officer has a reasonable suspicion to do a stop and frisk, and then his or her suspicion develops into probable cause as a result of the stop and frisk, then the officer can arrest and search you further. Know when a stop is justified. Officers can stop people during an investigation or to prevent crime before it happens. An officer is justified in stopping you if the officer reasonably believes you:\nDon't fit the time or place;\nMatch the description of a wanted suspect;\nAct strangely, or are emotional, angry, fearful, or intoxicated;\nAre loitering or looking for something;\nAre running away or acting evasive or secretive;\nAre at a crime scene; or\nAre in a high-crime area (which is not alone sufficient for a reasonable suspicion). Know when a frisk is justified. If an officer has stopped you, he or she can pat down your outer clothing to check for weapons. If the officer feels something that he or she reasonably believes is a weapon or some other contraband, the officer can take it from you. You may be frisked if the officer:\nIs concerned for his or her own safety or the safety of others;\nSuspects you are about to commit a crime involving a weapon;\nIs concerned by the behavior, emotional state, and/or appearance of the suspects;\nAsked questions and received evasive answers; or\nFactors in the location and time of day (which alone is not sufficient to justify a frisk). Stay calm and comply when stopped. If an officer stops you, you are not automatically under arrest. Even if you believe the officer lacks a reasonable suspicion to stop you, stay calm and comply with the officer's instructions. You can contact a lawyer later. A stop is only supposed to last as long as is reasonably necessary for the officer to investigation the situation. Make a mental note of how long you were detained and make a complaint if the detention was unreasonably long. Many have complained of officers abusing the stop and frisk process and harassing the public. Whether or not you believe your stop is justified, just assume that the officer is concerned for his or her own safety. You can file a complaint after the situation has resolved. Request a lawyer if you are arrested. If the officer finds a weapon or other contraband during the frisk, you will probably be arrested. Remain calm and request a lawyer. If you cannot afford one, one will be provided to you. A lawyer may be able to challenge the constitutionality of the officer's conduct or negotiate a favorable plea deal on your behalf.",

        "Generally, the longer the officer kept you, the more likely it is that the officer pulled you over for a reason other than how you were driving.",

        "If the arresting officer testifies that you violated any traffic laws, he or she will easily obtain a warrant.",
        "Understand when the officer can legally search your car.",
        "In the USA, under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, you have the right to be free from \u201cunreasonable\u201d searches and seizures.",

        "Otherwise, you can say \u201cno\u201d when a police officer asks to search your car.",

        "Keep in mind that in the United States, moving vehicles are subject by law enforcement to search with probable cause after a traffic stop.",
        "Probable cause may include observing occupants in suspicious activities and things that the officer can smell, see, or hear, such as safety violations, open containers, and items that could potentially appear to be weapons.",
        "Once an officer has probable cause, your entire vehicle is subject to search.",
        "An officer may also search a vehicle if given permission.",
        "However, if an officer asks you for permission to search your vehicle, you do not have to say yes.",
        "Refusing to give consent for a search cannot be used by the officer as probable cause to search your vehicle.",
        "However, if you do say no to a search, the officer may try to establish probable cause for the search by asking more questions and closely inspecting the areas of the vehicle that are in plain view.",
        "Additionally, if you are arrested as a result of a possibly illegal search of your car, tell your attorney that you believe the search was illegal.",
        "Do not argue with the officer.",
        "There is plenty of time later in traffic court to argue about your ticket.",
        "Instead, thank the officer and remain in control of your emotions.",
        "If you believe that you were pulled over for an illegal reason, or that the police officer did something that was illegal, do not address it with the officer while you are stopped.",
        "Instead, try to get or remember the officer\u2019s name for later.",
        "If you believe that the officer did something illegal, you can contact an attorney and see if you have a case, or file a complaint with the county or state where the police officer is based.",
        "Find legal remedies after the stop.",
        "If the police violated your rights, you can respond with a legal challenge later.",
        "If you believe that you were illegally pulled over because the officer was engaged in profiling, contact an attorney or file a complaint against that police officer.",
        "If you receive a ticket from the officer, his or her name and badge number should be listed on the ticket.",
        "If you did not receive a ticket, try to find out the officer\u2019s name by either looking for a name tag or asking directly.",
        "You can also try to get the license plate number from the officer\u2019s car.",
        "Dealing with a Police Roadblock Understand when the police set up roadblocks.",
        "Police officers may only set up roadblocks and checkpoints for special situations beyond the normal needs for law enforcement.",
        "These \u201cspecial situations\u201d include when police officers are concerned with:\nDrunk drivers (the most common)\nBorder security\nApprehending specific criminal suspects Get to know how police operate typical roadblocks.",
        "If law enforcement officers set up a roadblock, they may stop all cars that drive to the roadblock, random cars, and/or cars matching a description of a vehicle involved in a crime.",
