                    "description": "Believe it or not, your pencil case is a key part of being a well-organized student. The more organized your pencil case is, the less time you'll spend digging around for a pen or pencil, and the more time you'll have to write notes and listen to your teacher. Get a pencil case with several pockets, so you can tuck everything in its proper place. For example, you could keep your pens and pencils in 1 pocket, your erasers and sharpener in another, and your glue and scissors in a third. Consider having 2 pencil cases. Use 1 for pens and/or pencils only, and the other for items you seldom use, like glue, scissors, and art supplies. Make sure your pencil case has at least 3 pencils, 3 pens, an eraser, and a highlighter. Depending on how you prefer to take notes, you can also include different colored pens and highlighters or sticky notes in your pencil pouch as well."

For example, you could use red for Literature, blue for Math, and green for Science. If you choose to use both a binder and a folder for each class, make sure that they match. For example, you could use a red folder and a red binder for Literature."

This way, when you're handing in homework to your teacher, you know exactly where it should be. Separating your notes also helps you keep them chronological and makes for easier studying later on!

Put it in your pencil case or backpack as soon as you get it, so you don't forget it at home! Being unprepared for class can not only distract you, but your classmates as well, especially if you have to ask them for supplies. It can also detract from your participation grade."

Rewriting things in your own words may help you learn, understand, and memorize the material better! There are lots of different ways to take notes, so you may have to try several different techniques before you find one that works for you. Try the Cornell method for more organized notes. To follow the Cornell method, draw a horizontal line about 6 lines from the bottom of your lined paper. Then, draw a vertical line about 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the left size of the paper. This should create a total of 3 boxes. Use the left-hand vertical box to take down key points, the right-hand larger box to take down general notes, and the bottom horizontal box for review, clarification, and summary after class. When studying for a test, first read the bottom horizontal box, and then go up to the other 2 boxes if you need more information. The Cornell note taking method might be the right note taking method for you if you're studying something like History that has a lot of key points and specific details. Practice the Mind Map note taking format. For Mind Mapping, you'll need a blank sheet of paper instead of lined paper. Mind Mapping uses bubbles to connect individual keywords to one another. The benefits of Mind Map note taking is that you can easily see the relationship and connections between 2 ideas at a glance. If you feel yourself often getting bored taking notes, try Mind Mapping, since it's more creative! Mind Mapping can be effective for subjects like Literature, where 1 main subject (i.e. a book) has several important features (i.e. characters, themes, plot points, etc). Use the Smart Wisdom note taking method. If you're struggling to write linear notes, or you can't find the important information when you read your notes again, try the Smart Wisdom method, which puts keywords into a chain and drops any words that aren't important. With the Smart Wisdom method, the most important words are on the page, while other, unnecessary words get dropped. The Smart Wisdom method can be helpful for subjects like Math or Physics where you have little time to write down what a formula does or why it's important.

        "For example, you could keep your pens and pencils in 1 pocket, your erasers and sharpener in another, and your glue and scissors in a third.",
        "Consider having 2 pencil cases.",
        "Use 1 for pens and/or pencils only, and the other for items you seldom use, like glue, scissors, and art supplies.",
        "Make sure your pencil case has at least 3 pencils, 3 pens, an eraser, and a highlighter.",
        "Depending on how you prefer to take notes, you can also include different colored pens and highlighters or sticky notes in your pencil pouch as well.",
        "Separate your work into different colored folders or binders.",
        "It's helpful to have 1 binder or folder for each class so your papers don't get disorganized.",
        "Make sure you get different colors for each subject and label them.",
        "For example, you could use red for Literature, blue for Math, and green for Science.",
        "If you choose to use both a binder and a folder for each class, make sure that they match.",
        "For example, you could use a red folder and a red binder for Literature.",
        "Label different sections in your binder.",
        "Use colored dividers in your binders so you can separate your graded papers from your handouts and your homework.",
        "This way, when you're handing in homework to your teacher, you know exactly where it should be.",
        "Separating your notes also helps you keep them chronological and makes for easier studying later on!",
        "Use the same order and sections for each binder.",
        "For example, if you put your notes first and homework last in your English binder, do the same for Math and Science.",
        "Know where your things are.",
        "There is no \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d way to organize your backpack\u2014the important thing is that you know where everything is.",
        "Keep your items in the same spot, and return them to your backpack as soon as you're done using them.",
        "Even if the bell rings and you want to rush out of class, those few extra seconds to put your items in the right place will help you find them later on!",
        "For example, if you keep your pencil case in the small pocket on your backpack, be sure to always return the pencil case into that pocket.",
        "Purchase any additional supplies you need.",
        "A big part of being organized is being prepared.",
        "If you're running out of paper, pencils, or something else, make sure to buy more or ask your parents to buy you more.",
        "Put it in your pencil case or backpack as soon as you get it, so you don't forget it at home!",
        "Being unprepared for class can not only distract you, but your classmates as well, especially if you have to ask them for supplies.",
        "It can also detract from your participation grade.",
        "Taking Organized Notes Keep your notes simple and effective.",
        "Stick to keywords and short sentences that are easy to jot down.",
        "Use a highlighter for the most important parts.",
        "Listen to the teacher and write their lecture in your own words instead of copying it down verbatim.",
        "Rewriting things in your own words may help you learn, understand, and memorize the material better!",
        "There are lots of different ways to take notes, so you may have to try several different techniques before you find one that works for you.",
        "Try the Cornell method for more organized notes.",
        "To follow the Cornell method, draw a horizontal line about 6 lines from the bottom of your lined paper.",
        "Then, draw a vertical line about 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the left size of the paper.",
        "This should create a total of 3 boxes.",
        "Use the left-hand vertical box to take down key points, the right-hand larger box to take down general notes, and the bottom horizontal box for review, clarification, and summary after class.",
        "When studying for a test, first read the bottom horizontal box, and then go up to the other 2 boxes if you need more information.",
        "The Cornell note taking method might be the right note taking method for you if you're studying something like History that has a lot of key points and specific details.",
        "Practice the Mind Map note taking format.",
        "For Mind Mapping, you'll need a blank sheet of paper instead of lined paper.",
        "Mind Mapping uses bubbles to connect individual keywords to one another.",
        "The benefits of Mind Map note taking is that you can easily see the relationship and connections between 2 ideas at a glance.",
        "If you feel yourself often getting bored taking notes, try Mind Mapping, since it's more creative!",
        "Mind Mapping can be effective for subjects like Literature, where 1 main subject (i.e.",
        "a book) has several important features (i.e.",
        "characters, themes, plot points, etc).",
        "Use the Smart Wisdom note taking method.",
        "If you're struggling to write linear notes, or you can't find the important information when you read your notes again, try the Smart Wisdom method, which puts keywords into a chain and drops any words that aren't important.",
        "With the Smart Wisdom method, the most important words are on the page, while other, unnecessary words get dropped.",
        "The Smart Wisdom method can be helpful for subjects like Math or Physics where you have little time to write down what a formula does or why it's important.",
        "Setting up the Night Before Throw away anything you no longer need at the end of each day.",
        "Make sure you throw out any trash or unnecessary papers that have accumulated in your backpack.",
        "If you've received a graded paper back, and your backpack is getting heavy, find a place to put it on your desk at home.",
        "Consider doing another round of clean-up at the end of each week, month, and semester.",
        "Don't throw away old assignments and tests until after the final; they can be useful study materials!",
        "Make sure your bag is packed the night before.",
        "After you're done with your homework, put everything that you might need for the next day back in your backpack.",
        "Put your backpack someplace you won't forget, like at the door or on top of your shoes.",
        "By packing your backpack the night before, you don't have to worry if you have everything the next morning, and you're less likely to forget something!",
        "Prepare clothes or food the night before.",
        "If you typically spend a lot of time in the mornings worrying about what to wear, decide your clothes for tomorrow the night before, and lay them out.",
        "Similarly, if you spend a lot of time making breakfast or lunch in the mornings, try doing that the night before.",
        "For a simple school outfit, try a pair of jeans and a t-shirt on top.",
        "If you live somewhere cold, make sure you remember to bring a jacket!",
        "One easy, healthy breakfast you can prepare the night before is a hardboiled egg with some milk or juice.",
        "If you bring lunch to school, make your sandwich the night before!",
        "Put things you need to remember for the next day in a visible place.",
        "Put a post-it note on your bathroom mirror, lunch box, or door so you'll be sure to see your reminder the following morning.",
        "If you want to remember something physical, put the thing you can't forget on top of your shoes, since you can't leave the house without them!",
        "Establishing Reminders Use a planner.",
        "Practice using your planner daily by writing down any homework, tests, or club meeting dates.",
        "Check your planner before leaving school so you bring all homework supplies home.",
        "If you'd like, you can also color coordinate your planner by subject for easy reading.",
        "If you can't find a planner you like, you can also make your own.",

        "Clean your locker/desk regularly so that you can find whatever you need easily.",
