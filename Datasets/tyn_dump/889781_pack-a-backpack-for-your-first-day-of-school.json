You can choose a standard backpack, a messenger bag, or a rolling backpack if your school allows it. To decide on a backpack, you should check the material, padding, size, and the straps. For material, you should check the fabric that the backpack is made of. Synthetic materials like nylon and polyester are good because they are fairly water-resistant. Hemp is a good choice if you want a natural material. If you choose a traditional backpack, check it for padding. It should have foam padding. Pinch the padding to see if it rebounds.
