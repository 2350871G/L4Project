        "Cold weather can deplete an older battery at a much faster rate.",
        "Look at the top of the battery for the installation date.",
        "If the date on the battery is older than two or three years, think about purchasing a new one before winter begins.",
        "Remove any signs of whitish powder that might have gathered on the terminal connections.",
        "Clean away the buildup with equal parts baking soda and warm water solution.",
        "Arrange a servicing for your vehicle.",
        "Ensure that your engine is performing at optimal performance level by having a mechanic or auto service.",
        "If you\u2019re good with cars, feel free to conduct your own inspection at home.",

        "Fit your car with snow chains.",
        "Place the snow chain over the tire, holding it at the top and letting it fall evenly over the front of the tire and wheel.",
        "Once the chain is evenly and securely placed on the three-quarters of the wheel not touching the road, place the snow chains onto the rest of the tires.",
        "When the snow chains are on three-quarters of all of the tires, get into your car and drive forward for less than a metre.",
        "This will expose the part of the tire that was touching the ground previously.",
        "Put on the handbrake, get out of the car, and finish securing the remaining chains to the rest of the wheel.",
        "Use a closer link to tighten the chains where they close.",
        "Adding snow chains to your vehicle might be necessary for drivers in some areas, but often times if you have snow tires installed; you can save yourself a little trouble and not have to bother using snow chains at all."
