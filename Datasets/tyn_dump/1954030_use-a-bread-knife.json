    "text": " Selecting a Bread Knife Buy a serrated knife. The blade should have sharp, scalloped edges, which are ideal for slicing a loaf of bread without flattening it. Opt for a longer blade. A longer blade will grant you greater versatility for slicing larger loaves of bread. Ideally, your blade should be between 9-10 inches (22-25 cm) long. Choose an inexpensive bread knife. Sharpening serrated blades is a laborious, expensive process, so it\u2019s best to replace your bread knives every few years rather than attempt to maintain a single blade. You can find high quality bread knives online or in home and cooking supply stores between $20-30. Replace your bread knife about once every five years. In order to get the best use out of your bread knife, it's recommended that you replace your knife every few years in order to ensure that your blade is still sharp and versatile. Slicing Bread Use a wooden cutting board. Wooden surfaces are ideal for bread knives; cutting breads on surfaces made of plastic or bamboo will dull the blade. Choose a cutting board large enough to fit your entire bread loaf onto the surface. Ensure that your loaf of bread is completely cool. Warm bread is more difficult to slice than cool bread, and is also more likely to become mashed or torn in the process. If you are cutting freshly baked bread, allow the bread to cool to room temperature before you attempt to slice it. Stabilize the bread with your non-dominant hand. Place the bread on a cutting board horizontally so you are looking at it lengthwise, and hold the bread down firmly to keep it from moving. To avoid cutting yourself, keep your fingers curled a few inches away from your knife at all times. Hold the bread knife in your dominant hand. Choke up on the knife handle until your thumb and index finger grip the blade just past the handle. Be sure to position your hand on top of the knife and not below the sharp edge of the blade. Position the back edge of the knife on the butt of the bread closest to your body. Press down slightly on the knife, and then pull the blade back. Place the blade at a slight angle facing down towards the bread knife, and begin sawing through the bread. Press down slightly, and then pull the blade back towards yourself. Use a gentle sawing motion. The sharp, serrated edges will slice through your loaf of bread with minimal force necessary. Do not attempt to press down through the blade, as this defeats the purpose of the bread knife\u2019s serrated edges. Repeat this back-and-forth motion until your blade has cut clean through the loaf. Utilize the entire length of the blade. Doing so will not only speed up the bread-slicing process, but it will also allow you to make longer, smoother cuts while minimizing crumbs as you saw through the loaf. Making shallow cuts with the knife results in ripping the bread. Remove the first slice of bread. Repeat the slicing process by repositioning your knife at the edge of the bread loaf, and pushing the knife forward and down again to make the next cut. Continue to set slices aside as you work through the loaf. Stop slicing when you have reached the opposite end of the loaf. At this point, you have finished slicing a loaf of bread.",
