    "text": " Taking the Proper Safety Precautions Get an N-95 respirator. Inhaling mold spores is very unhealthy for your respiratory system. For this reason, it's important that you get a respirator or a facemask that can filter out the spores. You can purchase an N-95 respirator at most hardware stores or online. Pick up a pair of goggles when cleaning mold. Wearing a pair of thick goggles will prevent mold spores from getting into your eyes. Wear them when cleaning the mold on your grout and don't touch your eyes, mouth, or nose while you clean. Afterward, make sure to shower and wash your hands. Wear long rubber gloves. Do not touch mold with your bare hands. Instead, purchase a pair of natural rubber, neoprene, nitrile, polyurethane, or PVC gloves that go up to your elbow. This will keep your hands safe from the mold and chemicals while you clean. Seal off air vents and heating ducts with plastic. Seal off vents by placing a sheet of polyurethane plastic over them and sealing up the sides with duct tape.

To further prevent mold from being spread to other parts of your house, make sure that the room your cleaning is well-ventilated. A fan can push the mold spores outside, instead of spreading them around your house. Washing Grout with Vinegar Fill a spray bottle with equal parts water and white vinegar. Combine distilled white vinegar and water together in a spray bottle, in equal portions. Shake the bottle to mix the liquids together. Avoid using other acidic cleaners to wash your grout because it could damage your tile. Spray the moldy grout. Start from the top of your grout and spray the solution onto the grout.

Use a dry cotton towel to soak up any leftover moisture from rinsing. Rinse out the brush you used to remove any leftover mold spores in its bristles. Cleaning with Bleach and Baking Soda Mix baking soda and bleach together until it forms a paste. Combine 3/4 cup (96 g) of baking soda and 1/4 cup (59.14 ml) of bleach in a bowl. As you mix the two ingredients together, it should start to turn into a sticky solution similar to toothpaste. You can use hydrogen peroxide in place of bleach if you prefer.

The bleach will destroy the bristles of your brush, so use one that you don't mind throwing away. If you don't have a paintbrush, you can use an old toothbrush.
