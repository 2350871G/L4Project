Cover the blender with its lid. When making this recipe for the first time, it is best to start with the minimum amount of each ingredient. You can add more of certain ingredients later if you want to alter the taste or texture. To avoid splashes, place the solid ingredients (the ice and frozen peach slices) in the bottom of the blender. Pour the liquid ingredients on top of that. If necessary, you could substitute a sparkling white wine for high-quality champagne. Only use peach nectar. Do not use peach juice, since it is not as sweet and not as thick. Instead of using peach nectar, you could use fuzzy navel drink mix. When using fuzzy navel drink mix, also add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of sugar. Do not add the sugar if using peach nectar, though."
