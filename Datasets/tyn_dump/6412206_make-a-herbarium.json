        "Once you\u2019re satisfied with the layout of your plants, sandwich them with another layer of blotting or tissue paper, corrugated card, and hardboard.",
        "Pile bricks, large books, or similar items evenly across the upper board to weigh it down and press the cuttings flat.",
        "Another option is to use ratchet straps, ropes, or bands to secure your press and maintain constant pressure.",
        "Over the course of a few days, the weight of the press will squeeze all of the moisture out of the fresh cuttings, which will then be absorbed by the blotting paper.",
        "Continue drying and pressing your specimens for 2-21 days.",
        "Depending on the size and type of the plants you\u2019re preserving, it may take them anywhere from a couple of days to 3 full weeks to dry completely.",
        "In the meantime, check your specimens every 24 hours and replace the blotting paper and corrugated card backing every few days as they become saturated.",
        "A drying cabinet or airing cupboard will offer the best results for preserving fresh plants.",
        "If one of these spaces isn\u2019t available, look for a warm room with low humidity that might help speed up the process.",
        "Mounting and Labeling Your Plants Brush your dried specimens with non-acidic PVA adhesive.",
        "Apply a light coating of adhesive to the backside of each plant.",
        "You don\u2019t need much, so try not to overdo it.",
        "The adhesive will both hold your specimens in place on your backing paper and provide an additional layer of protection against deterioration.",
        "Your plants will be extremely fragile after drying, so handle them with care.",
        "It may help to use a pair of tweezers to avoid crushing them between your fingers.",
        "Non-acidic adhesives are readily available at most office supply stores and home improvement centers.",
        "Press your plants onto a sheet of acid-free paper.",
        "You might devote an entire sheet to a single species or bring together many different plants on the same sheet to showcase the diversity of your local ecosystem.",
        "The way you display your specimens is completely up to you\u2014just make sure each selection is plainly visible and has plenty of room.",
        "Use minimal pressure to keep your dried cuttings from breaking.",
        "Look for a backing paper that\u2019s roughly the same size as the materials you used to make your press.",
        "Remember, 16.5 in (42 cm) x 11 in (28 cm) is standard in the scientific community, but for a home herbarium you could also use A4 paper, which has dimensions similar to regular printer paper.Tip: Acid-free paper breaks down at a much slower rate than ordinary types of paper, which means your herbarium will last for years.",
        "Create label cards to classify each of your specimens.",
        "Fill out a blank white note card with the information you recorded earlier while gathering your cuttings.",
        "Write the plant\u2019s scientific and common names at the top of the card, then list its height, width, color, and the date and location of collection underneath in bullet-point form.",
        "Include any other fascinating tidbits you want your labels to convey as separate footnotes at the bottom.",
        "Type, print, and cut out your label cards to give them a more polished, professional appearance.",
        "Glue your labels to your herbarium sheets.",
        "Dab some more of your non-acidic PVA adhesive onto the back of each card, then stick it into place on an unused section of paper.",
        "Make sure the edges of the card are straight and square.",
        "When you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll have neatly-organized scientific plant profile to show for your efforts!",
        "Traditionally, informational labels go in the bottom righthand corner of an herbarium.",
        "However, you can put your labels wherever you like, as long as they don\u2019t cover up any part of your specimens."
