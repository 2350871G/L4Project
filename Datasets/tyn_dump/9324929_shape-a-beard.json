If your goal is to thin out a bushy beard, use upward strokes, so that the blades of the trimmer cut square across the hairs. If you'd rather preserve more of the bulk you've been so committed to growing, move the trimmer downward in the same direction that the hair lays naturally. Set the guard to about a 3 initially (which is usually somewhere around 9mm) and switch to a lower setting if you want to go shorter. That way, you can avoid accidentally shaving too much at once. Beard trimmers offer a more customizable trimming experience because of their ability to cut hair to a consistent length with every pass, unlike scissors, which force you hack away at tufts piece by piece."

Assuming that your head hair and facial hair are approximately the same length, you can let what's up top flow seamlessly into what's underneath. If one is significantly longer than the other, try fading your sideburns using increasingly smaller guards so that the difference isn't too jarring. For extremely short hairstyles like buzz cuts and shiny bald domes, blend your sideburns until they disappear around the top of your ear. Longer locks are a little simpler. Just keep your sideburns clean and neat, then leave everything above and below your ears as shaggy as you please."
