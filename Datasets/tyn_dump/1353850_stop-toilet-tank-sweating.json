                    "description": "If your bathroom has an exhaust fan, always turn it on before you start the shower. Then, leave it on for at least 10-15 minutes after finishing the shower. Venting out as much of the warm, humid air as possible will reduce the likelihood of tank sweat. Taking shorter, cooler showers will also help--and they're invigorating! Turn the fan on when you take a bath or run a lot of hot water in the sink as well. If your bathroom doesn't have a vent fan, crack open the door as a less ideal option. Opening a window won't help much unless the humidity is low outside."

Then, take the wet towel somewhere outside the bathroom to dry out. If you don't do this, the water on the shower walls will evaporate into the surrounding warm air and condense on the cool toilet tank."

However, if it is warmer outside than inside, and especially if it's both warmer and more humid outside, keep the bathroom windows closed. Otherwise, you're just increasing the temperature differential between the tank water and the air outside the tank, and providing moisture to condense on the surface."

Likewise, either an air conditioner or a dehumidifier will reduce the moisture content in the air, which in turn reduces condensation. Central air conditioning or a whole-house dehumidifier should do the trick. In some cases, though, you may need to place a window A/C or a portable dehumidifier in the bathroom."

        "Replace your current tank with an insulated one.",
        "Many modern toilets have insulated tanks, which should prevent sweating.",
        "If you have an older toilet or uninsulated tank, you may be able to find a compatible insulated tank for your toilet.",
        "Write down the brand and model of your current toilet, if you have that information, and head to a plumbing supply store.",
        "Replacing the tank alone can be more convenient, but often you'll find that replacing the entire toilet is a more feasible option.",
        "Buy a low-flow, insulated replacement toilet.",
        "Low-flow toilets have smaller tanks, which means they have less cool water to cool down the tank walls, which results in less condensation.",
        "Also, most modern low-flow toilets have insulated tanks, which also cut back on condensation.",
        "Especially if you have an older toilet, a newer model will significantly reduce your water consumption per flush.",
        "Installing a toilet can be a manageable DIY project for 1-2 people, or you may prefer to hire a plumber.",
        "Install a tempering valve to warm the water entering the tank.",
        "This valve connects to the cold water line going into the toilet as well as the hot water line.",
        "Mixing in some hot water increases the temperature of the water going into the tank, thereby reducing toilet tank condensation.",
        "The intake of hot water can also be shut off when tempering is not needed\u2014during winter, for example.",
        "Unless your water lines are easily accessible\u2014such as via the basement beneath the bathroom\u2014and you have decent plumbing skills, installing a tempering valve is best left to a professional plumber.",
        "Invest in a tempering tank.",
        "This works in a similar fashion to the tempering valve.",
        "In this case, though, the cold water line feeds into a separate holding tank, which warms the water before sending it to the toilet.",
        "This job requires open access to the water lines and enough space for the tank, among other complications.",
        "You'll almost certainly have to hire a pro to do the installation."
