If you want to make sure the shoulder seams are aligned, lift up the collar to check that they are stacked on top of each other.

If you still have a few jagged edges after pulling on the fabric, run the shirt through the washer and dryer to soften the fabric and hide the edges. Creating a Choker V-Neck Shirt Fold the shirt by lining up the shoulder seams at the collar. Hold the shirt with one hand at the front of the collar and one hand at the back of the collar, near the tag. This should make a crease down the center of the front of the shirt and the center of the back of the shirt. Then, lay the shirt on a flat surface.

Make sure the point is on the bottom part of the collar, since you won't be removing the collar from the shirt. Cut a straight line from the bottom point to the collar. Use a pair of sharp scissors to make long, straight cuts between the bottom of the v-neck and the point that you marked below the collar. Try to make as few cuts as possible to prevent jagged edges and don't cut into the collar. As you're cutting, make sure you have both layers of the shirt in the scissors. If you want to make a more rounded cut-out in the neckline, you can cut a curved line between the two points. Trim just below the collar to cut out the fabric triangle. Position your scissors along the crease, just below the collar of the shirt. Make long cuts, following the curve of the collar, until you reach the point that you had marked along the collar.

Cutting a Cold-Shoulder Shirt Lay the shirt flat on its back and smooth the fabric. For a cold-shoulder shirt, position the shirt on a flat surface with the front facing toward you. Use your hands to flatten the fabric around the collar and on the sleeves, which is where you'll be making most of the cuts for the shirt. You can use a long-sleeve or short-sleeve shirt for this. It's best to use a shirt that has shoulder seams, since they'll help guide your cutting. Make a 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) cut around the collar line on both shoulders. Working with one sleeve at a time, make a cut from the top of the shoulder down about 2 inches (5.1 cm), following the shape of the collar. Cut to about \u00bc of the way between the top of the shoulder and the center of the front of the collar, and then do the same to the back side of the shoulder. If you want the shoulder holes to be larger, you can cut to about halfway between the top of the shoulder and the middle of the collar on both sides of the shirt. Mark a spot that is 4 inches (10.2 cm) away from the collar, towards the shoulder. Use chalk or your finger to help you keep track of this spot. It can be helpful to use a ruler to measure 4 inches (10.2 cm) to help make your cut accurate. The marking should be at the very top of your shirt. Mark a spot that's further away to create a bigger hole for your shoulder, or if you're working with a larger-sized shirt. Cut a diagonal line from the marked spot to your first cut at the collar. Place your scissors on the top of the shoulder, and cut in a line to the end point of your first cut on the front part of the collar. Cut the diagonal line out of only the front part of the shirt. Then, cut along the natural shoulder line to cutout a piece of triangle-shaped fabric. Once you're done, repeat this process with the back of the shirt on this same sleeve. This sleeve of the shirt is finished, but you still have to cut the other cold shoulder. Make sure the fabric stays smooth and flat as you work! Align the triangle with the cut on the other sleeve and use it as a guide. Place the triangle of fabric so that one point lines up with the end of the cut on the front of the collar and the other lines up with the back. Then, cut along the edges of the fabric to make sure both shoulders have the same sized hole. When you're done cutting, you should have 2 triangles of fabric from the shoulders of the shirt, and the collar should still be intact around the neck of the shirt. Tug on the sides of the shoulder holes to stretch them slightly. Pull on each side of the triangle-shaped hole to make the fabric looser and to roll the edges, hiding any jagged points from the scissors. Do this for both sides of the shirt to make sure the holes are roughly the same size. If you want to make the fabric softer and widen the holes, wash and dry the shirt to roll the edges of the hole even further.",

        "Try to make as few cuts as possible to prevent jagged edges and don't cut into the collar.",
        "As you're cutting, make sure you have both layers of the shirt in the scissors.",
        "If you want to make a more rounded cut-out in the neckline, you can cut a curved line between the two points.",
        "Trim just below the collar to cut out the fabric triangle.",
        "Position your scissors along the crease, just below the collar of the shirt.",
        "Make long cuts, following the curve of the collar, until you reach the point that you had marked along the collar.",
        "Pull the piece of fabric away from the shirt to reveal the cutout.",
        "If you want to customize the shirt even further, you can make it sleeveless.",
        "Tug on the edges of the triangle gently to roll the edges.",
        "Put your fingers inside of the cut-out and gently pull the fabric to either side.",
        "Then, hold the collar in place and pull the bottom point of the v-neck down to roll in the edges of the fabric, hiding any jagged edges.",
        "When you're pulling the fabric, make sure you don't pull too hard and rip the shirt.",
        "If the fabric won't roll under, run the shirt through the washer and dryer to soften the fabric, making it easier to hide any edges.",
        "Cutting a Cold-Shoulder Shirt Lay the shirt flat on its back and smooth the fabric.",
        "For a cold-shoulder shirt, position the shirt on a flat surface with the front facing toward you.",
        "Use your hands to flatten the fabric around the collar and on the sleeves, which is where you'll be making most of the cuts for the shirt.",
        "You can use a long-sleeve or short-sleeve shirt for this.",
        "It's best to use a shirt that has shoulder seams, since they'll help guide your cutting.",
        "Make a 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) cut around the collar line on both shoulders.",
        "Working with one sleeve at a time, make a cut from the top of the shoulder down about 2 inches (5.1 cm), following the shape of the collar.",
        "Cut to about \u00bc of the way between the top of the shoulder and the center of the front of the collar, and then do the same to the back side of the shoulder.",
        "If you want the shoulder holes to be larger, you can cut to about halfway between the top of the shoulder and the middle of the collar on both sides of the shirt.",
        "Mark a spot that is 4 inches (10.2 cm) away from the collar, towards the shoulder.",
        "Use chalk or your finger to help you keep track of this spot.",
        "It can be helpful to use a ruler to measure 4 inches (10.2 cm) to help make your cut accurate.",
        "The marking should be at the very top of your shirt.",
        "Mark a spot that's further away to create a bigger hole for your shoulder, or if you're working with a larger-sized shirt.",
        "Cut a diagonal line from the marked spot to your first cut at the collar.",
        "Place your scissors on the top of the shoulder, and cut in a line to the end point of your first cut on the front part of the collar.",
        "Cut the diagonal line out of only the front part of the shirt.",
        "Then, cut along the natural shoulder line to cutout a piece of triangle-shaped fabric.",
        "Once you're done, repeat this process with the back of the shirt on this same sleeve.",
        "This sleeve of the shirt is finished, but you still have to cut the other cold shoulder.",
        "Make sure the fabric stays smooth and flat as you work!",
        "Align the triangle with the cut on the other sleeve and use it as a guide.",
        "Place the triangle of fabric so that one point lines up with the end of the cut on the front of the collar and the other lines up with the back.",
        "Then, cut along the edges of the fabric to make sure both shoulders have the same sized hole.",
        "When you're done cutting, you should have 2 triangles of fabric from the shoulders of the shirt, and the collar should still be intact around the neck of the shirt.",
        "Tug on the sides of the shoulder holes to stretch them slightly.",
        "Pull on each side of the triangle-shaped hole to make the fabric looser and to roll the edges, hiding any jagged points from the scissors.",
        "Do this for both sides of the shirt to make sure the holes are roughly the same size.",
        "If you want to make the fabric softer and widen the holes, wash and dry the shirt to roll the edges of the hole even further."
