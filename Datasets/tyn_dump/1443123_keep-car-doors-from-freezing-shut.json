Of course, not everyone has access to a covered parking space, heated garage, or the like. Avoid locking your doors. If possible, keep doors unlocked. This will avoid the locking mechanism from locking into place. However, leaving the doors unlocked may allow the car to be entered by a thief. Do not leave any valuables in the vehicle if you plan on leaving it unlocked. Place duct tape over your door lock to keep it from freezing. If your car is parked outside, a car cover or tarp minimizes the amount of moisture from snow and rain that can reach the door parts and freeze.This is especially useful during an ice storm or other icing event."
