Storing Blueberries in the Refrigerator Find a basket-like container and wash it well. You can use a ceramic bowl with slits in it, or you can use the original plastic basket that the blueberries came in. The container will need to have small holes in it to provide adequate ventilation. Avoid using anything made from metal. Blueberries can react with metal, leading to discoloration and stains on both the berries and the metal container. Fold a paper towel into quarters and place it in the bottom of the basket.
