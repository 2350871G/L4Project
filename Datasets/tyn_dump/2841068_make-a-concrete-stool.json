Also follow any instructions provided on the concrete packaging. Smoothing and Adding Legs Use the garden hoe bottom to smooth and level the bottom of the stool, if necessary. The concrete will most likely be smoothed already but use the tool if needed. Add the stool legs. Strategically place the legs inside the concrete, making sure you add the legs while the concrete is still wet and can absorb the legs. If necessary, hold the legs in place while the concrete sets. Check that the leg ends are all aligned evenly, to avoid a wobbly stool! Allow the concrete to set. This can take up to 20 hours (see the packaging instructions). The concrete must be completely set before you remove the stool structure from the bucket. Removing the Stool from the  Bucket Tear the bucket away from the dried concrete. Bend the sides of the bucket outwards so that the concrete begins to loosen. Turn the stool right side up so that it stands on its legs. Now you can see how it works. Make any adjustments if needed (such as cutting down uneven legs, etc.). You might also like to add non-slip bases to the bottom of the legs. Ask at the hardware store for appropriate additions. Sand around the concrete base of the stool with the sandpaper. This will smooth and shape the seat. You now have a chic concrete stool. ",
