Once the water begins to boil, turn the heat down so that it stays at a simmer rather than a rolling boil.

Allowing them to air dry naturally may cause them to cool too much. Preparing the Pears Choose the right pears. Pears used for canning should be the same pears you use for eating. The fruit should be ripe and soft. Do not use under-ripe fruit or pears that have soft spots, bruises, or rotted portions. Wash and peel the pears. Sanitation is key in keeping the pears safe for consumption. Wash the pears by running them under cool to warm water, scrubbing the skins lightly with your fingers or a soft toothbrush. Use a knife or vegetable peeler to remove the thin layer of skin on the outside of each pear. Slice the pears. Use a sharp knife to cut the pears into halves. You can also cut them into quarters, if desired. Cut around the inner core and remove any seeds or pieces of the core from the halves or quarters. Dip the pears in lemon juice. Put the lemon juice into a large stockpot and add the pear slices. Toss the slices in the juice to coat. The lemon juice acts as a preservative to prevent the pears from browning after being cut. Heat the sugar and water in a medium saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat before reducing the heat to medium and allowing the syrup to simmer an additional two to three minutes. This simple syrup will be what the pears sit in inside their jars. Add the syrup to the pears. Pour the syrup into the pot of pears and mix well to coat. There should be enough liquid to cover the fruit slices. Bring the contents of the stockpot to a boil. After the pears are sitting in syrup, heat them over medium-high until the syrup reaches a boil again. Cook the pears slightly. Reduce the heat so that the syrup comes down to a simmer again. Cover the pot and cook for about four to five minutes. You do not want them to become too soft, but the pears should be warmed thoroughly. Canning the Pears Begin boiling water in a boiling-water canner. Fill the canner about two-thirds high with water, or enough to cover the jars when placed inside. Make sure that a jar rack is placed at the bottom for your jars to sit on. If you do not have a rack, you may need to place a dish towel on the bottom of the canner to prevent the jars from moving around too much as they process. You can use a large stockpot in place of a boiling-water canner if necessary. You will still need to place a rack or towel inside, though. Place a wide-mouth funnel into each jar as you fill it. You can fill the jars without a funnel, but the process will usually be a little slower and messier without one. Scoop the pears into the jars. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the pears from the pot into the jars. Focus on transferring the pears for now, rather than the syrup, to make sure that the pears are evenly distributed in the jars. Ladle syrup over the pears in the jars. Slowly pour syrup from the stockpot into each jar to fill up empty space. The pears should be completely covered by the syrup, but you need to leave at least 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of empty space at the top of each jar. Remove any air bubbles. Take a plastic knife or smooth butter knife and run it around the inside perimeter of the jar to remove air bubbles trapped inside. Clean off the tops of the jars. If you got syrup or anything else onto the outside of the jars, wipe it off with a clean sponge or towel. Excess syrup can actually prevent the jars from sealing correctly. Place the lids on the jars. Firmly fix the lids onto the jars, but stop once you begin to feel resistance. Making the lids too tight can actually cause the jars to chip or crack as they process. Carefully lower the jars into the boiling water in the canner. Use jar tongs or a magnetic jar lifter. Make sure that the jars do not strike each other going into the canner and that they do not touch each other inside the canner. Process the canned pears until sealed. The processing time will vary depending on your altitude. Process pint-size jars for 20 minutes at altitudes below 1000 feet (304.8 m). Process for for 25 minutes for altitudes between 1000 and 3000 feet (304.8 m to 914.4 m). Process for 30 minutes at altitudes between 3000 and 6000 feet (914.4 m to 1.828 km).
