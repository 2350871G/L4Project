                    "description": "Room temperature soap is going to be very hard to cut, so you'll want to warm it up in the microwave. Don't microwave it for too long though, or you'll risk melting your soap. Once one side has been microwaved, flip it over and microwave it for the same length of time. Even if there isn't any residue visibly left on the plate after you microwave your soap, you'll still want to wash your plate. It's not healthy to ingest even small amounts of soap, so you'll want to clean your plate thoroughly."

Move your knife through the soap slowly by pressing your handle directly down while keeping the point of the blade firmly pressed against the cutting board, opposite to where you're standing. Soap is slippery, so don't cut too quickly or you'll risk cutting yourself. The distance between cuts will determine the width of each individual piece of soap. A larger distance between cuts will result in bigger pieces, and smaller incisions will result in smaller pieces. If your soap feels harder than a cold block of cheese while you're cutting it, microwave each side for an additional 5 seconds."
