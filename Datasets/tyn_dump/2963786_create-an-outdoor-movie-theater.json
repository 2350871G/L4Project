You can buy a new one from your local home supply store, or you can use an old sheet that you don\u2019t use anymore. Just make sure there are no holes or tears in it. If you\u2019re looking to buy a new sheet, keep in mind that high thread count bedsheets tend to reflect light better than thinner sheets. If you would like a thicker material, buy a piece of canvas drop cloth from your local hardware store. Alternatively, if you don\u2019t want to use a sheet and would like a thicker material, purchase a piece of canvas drop cloth. Make sure it measures at least 8 by 16 ft (2.4 by 4.9 m), because you\u2019re going to fold it over to make a 4 by 8 ft (1.2 by 2.4 m) screen. Fold the white king-size sheet in half. Fold it so it\u2019s inside-out, meaning that the hemmed seams of the sheet face outward. Use a tape measure to take its dimensions. It should measure to be about 4 by 10 ft (1.2 by 3.0 m). Lay the pipe with attached elbows along the width of the sheet. Lay out 1 8 ft (2.4 m) pipe (elbow connectors attached!) along the width of the sheet. Use a pencil and a ruler to mark the width of the pipe on the sheet. The elbow connectors will add a small amount of width, and you\u2019ll want to know exactly how wide the screen will be so you can cut our sheet accordingly. Cut off the excess 2 ft (0.61 m) of fabric on one side. This will make the screen just over 8 ft (2.4 m) wide. It should be able to slide snugly over the PVC pipe frame that you will make. Hot-glue together the 2 sides of the sheet on each 4 ft (1.2 m) side. Apply a line of hot glue along what will be the height of the screen. Let it dry for up to 2 minutes. This will form a makeshift seam on each side. Turn your screen right-side out and iron it. Flip your sheet so the seams are facing inward. Iron out any wrinkles, as this could distort any images that are projected onto it. Building the Screen Frame Assemble the main frame by attaching the pipes with the connectors. Lay out the pieces on the ground in the way that they will be connected. The 8 ft (2.4 m) pieces should be across from each other and the 4 ft (1.2 m) pieces should be across from each other, forming a rectangle. Connect the top corners of the rectangle using the elbow connectors. Connect the bottom corners of the rectangle using the tee connectors. Attach the pipe pieces for the legs. The legs of your frame will be comprised of the 2 ft (0.61 m) pieces. These pieces will intersect perpendicularly to form 2 right angles. Add on 2 of the 2 ft (0.61 m) pieces to the tee connectors at the bottom of the rectangle. Then, attach your remaining 2 tee connectors to the bottom of the 2 ft (0.61 m) pipes. Place 2 2 ft (0.61 m) pieces in the tee connectors so they stick straight up in the air. Stand your screen upright, and add on the remaining 2 ft (0.61 m) pieces to complete the stand. Secure the 4 caps on the 4 ends of the legs. Pull the sheet screen down over the PVC-pipe frame so it\u2019s taut. Now, with your frame standing up, fully-assembled, take your sheet screen and pull it over the frame. It\u2019s similar to putting a sock on a foot. Make sure it\u2019s pulled tight so there are no wrinkles. If you measured correctly, it should be pretty taut. If needed, ask a friend to help you, because this can be tricky to do alone! One of the benefits of this particular screen setup is that it can easily be un-assembled and stored until you\u2019re ready to use it next! Attach black trash bags to the back of your projector with tape. This may not be necessary, but if your sheet is too thin, the light from your projector may pass right through it. To fix this, flatten black trash bags against the entirety of the back of your screen and tape them on. Setting up Your Projector Buy or rent a projector with HDMI connectivity.

For example, if you\u2019re watching the scenes from Gravity that feature a lot of the black space background, you\u2019ll still want to be able to see the stars and smaller details in the black parts. Balance your projector\u2019s contrast to bring out details in white. Find a scene that features a lot of the color white and adjust the contrast slider until the white parts of the image retain as much detail as possible. Doing this will likely alter the appearance of your black images, so do your best to find a balance where you can discern detail in both colors. With a projected image, black is just the absence of light, whereas white is the addition of it. If your brightness or contrast is off, it can leave black and white parts of images looking like blobs of color rather than objects with details. Adjust color temperature so actors in the movie don\u2019t look orange. Skip to a scene that features any human. Then, adjust the color temperature slider on your projector until the shade of their skin looks natural. Finding the right color temperature is easiest to do when looking at skin tones. Rigging up Your Sound System Invest in a 2.0 outdoor sound system. If you\u2019re looking for your outdoor theater to be a permanent setup, purchase a 2.0 channel stereo system. This system produces 2 channels of sound \u2014 left and right. It is generally less expensive than other multi-channel setups and requires the least amount of wiring. Connect the device playing the movie to your speakers. If you\u2019re using wireless speakers, connect your projector or laptop to your sound system via Bluetooth by going to the Bluetooth option on your device and pairing it with your speakers. If you\u2019re using wired speakers, make sure that your projector and speaker system have compatible AUX ports \u2014 meaning that the stereo cables that connect the speakers to the device actually fit in the device. It\u2019s usually not hard to find inexpensive used sound systems at thrift stores or yard sales, but just make sure they can actually connect with your devices. If possible, have multiple speakers placed around the yard so all of your guests can hear the movie. To do this with wired speakers, you will probably need long extension cords so you can connect your speakers back to your device. Run a sound test before your official movie night. Once you have your speakers hooked up, do a sound test by playing part of your movie on low volume. Gradually increase the volume until it is at a comfortable level where all your guests will be able to hear. If you can, use a speaker system with a separate subwoofer to generate a more dynamic sound. A subwoofer is essentially an air pump that produces low-bass frequencies. Making it Comfortable for Your Guests Place cushions, blankets, and comfortable chairs around your screen. Movies are long, so you\u2019ll want to make sure that your guests have a comfortable place to sit throughout. Folding camping chairs or bean-bags work great for this.Image:Create an Outdoor Movie Theater Step 22.jpg\nIf you don\u2019t have any chairs on hand, you can lay blankets and pillows on the ground. If it\u2019s going to get chilly later in the evening, remind your guests to bring along sweaters. Have snacks and refreshments available. Adding snacks to your backyard movie night will only enhance it! Popcorn and candy are easy go-tos, but healthier snacks are always a smart idea as well. Some healthy snack suggestions are celery sticks, pretzels, fruit salad, carrot sticks, or crackers and cheese. Purchasing some paper popcorn bags can make it feel just like you\u2019re at the movie theater! Ward off bugs with citronella candles and bug spray. If you live in an area where mosquitos and other pests tend to congregate, you can keep them away by placing citronella candles around your theater. Just make sure that none of them are close to any flammable objects. Alternatively, you can use traditional bug sprays or creams. Bug sprays often have an ingredient called DEET in them. It\u2019s a powerful insect repellent, but it can irritate your skin, so avoid spraying it directly on your skin if possible. Do your best to not disturb your neighbors with noise. If you live in a suburban area, you might want to ask for your neighbors\u2019 permission or let them know that you will be doing a backyard movie night beforehand. Or (even better) invite them to join the party! This will give them a heads-up about what you\u2019re doing, and also make them feel welcome in your home. Some areas have noise restrictions imposed by the local government, so be mindful of these.",
