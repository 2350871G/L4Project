As soon as a ground ball is hit to someone other than you, sprint to first base and position yourself with your foot opposite your glove hand (i.e., right foot if you catch with left hand and are thus \"right-handed\" and the other way around for lefties) against the edge of the base.

If you're left-handed, play a bit closer to the foul line since anything hit down the line will be a \"backhand\" play for you. Conversely, if you're right-handed, you can play \"off the line\" a bit more since balls hit down the line will be easier for you to snag since your glove hand will be nearer to them."

If practiced and executed you will have yourself a triple play! Backing up other positions:  As a first baseman, you're involved in nearly all infield plays. However, you're involved in very few outfield plays. If a ball is hit into the outfield and there may be a play at second base, third base or home plate, be ready to back up those bases in case a throw gets loose.
