    "text": " Grow Hydroponic Mushrooms Using a Mushroom Growing Kit Purchase a mushroom growing kit from your local gardening supply store. Kits are blocks of compressed sawdust that have been saturated with mushroom seeds. Immerse the mushroom block in a container of cold water. Make sure it is completely immersed; allow several inches of water to cover the top of the block. Allow the block to soak for several hours. The mushroom block has to be thoroughly saturated. Place the container in a dark, cool spot. The temperature should range between 60\u00baF and 75\u00baF (15.6\u00baC to 23.8\u00baC). Harvest your crop of mushrooms. Most hydroponic mushrooms are ready for harvesting in 3 to 5 days. Let the sawdust block rest for a week and then repeat the process. Immerse the block in cold water and allow it to get thoroughly saturated before you place it in a dark, cool spot. Reuse the sawdust block each week until you are no longer getting a good harvest. The number of times you can reuse your block will depend on how much time it takes for the nutrients to become depleted. Toss the sawdust block in your compost pile when it no longer produces mushrooms. You can then start the process over with a new mushroom kit. Grow Hydroponic Mushrooms without a Mushroom Kit Start your mushrooms with fresh mushrooms or mushroom spores. Both can be purchased online or at your local gardening center. These are needed to grow mycelium (fungus). If desired, you can simply purchase liquid mycelium to start the process. Place small pieces of mushroom, spores or cultures on a sterile Petri dish, which allows the mycelium to grow. The mycelium has to grow until it is strong enough to support a mushroom reproductive cycle. Allow the fungus to grow in the Petri dish. This will most likely take several weeks. Transfer the fungus to a tightly packed, sterilized grain, such as wheat or rye. It will take up to 4 weeks for the mushrooms to colonize the grain. Start harvesting your mushrooms when they have begun to grow on the grain. Check on their progress every few days once they have colonized the grain. Use your grain seeds to grow more grain. You can then use that grain for  your next batch of mushroom spores.",
