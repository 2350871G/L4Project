You will need about 2 to 3 yards (1.8 to 2.7 m) of fabric depending on your size. If you are making leggings for a baby or toddler, then you will only need about 1 yard (0.91 m) of fabric. For baby and toddler leggings, you can also use a printed t-shirt for fabric. Make sure it is a shirt that you are willing cut up. You can use an old t-shirt or buy one on clearance."

Then, fold your leggings in half lengthwise and lay them out on the paper. Align the outer edge of the leggings with the edge of the paper. You will not need to trace along this edge.

After you have cut out your pattern, take your fabric and fold it in half lengthwise 2 times. This will allow you to cut out both leg pieces at once. Make sure that the fabric is lined up evenly. Another option is to cut out 2 pieces separately by creating 2 separate folds in your fabric and cutting along the waist, inseam, and bottom of the legging pattern twice.

To cut out your fabric pieces for sewing leggings, use a rotary cutter and cut along the top, bottom, and inseam of your pattern. Do not cut along the folded edge of the fabric. Sewing the Pieces Together Pin along the inseam of the leg. Take your fabric pieces and separate them. Then, take one piece and fold it in half lengthwise so that the inseam of the leg is matching up and the printed side of the fabric is on the inside. Place pins along the inseam of the leg, but do not pin past the crotch area on the legging piece. After you pin up the inseam on one piece, do the same with the other piece. Sew along the inseam. When you have finished pinning both of the legging pieces along the inseam, use a sewing machine to sew a zigzag stitch along the pinned areas. Sew about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the edge of the inseam. Do not sew past the crotch area. Remove the pins as you sew. Trim off the excess threads when you are done. Insert one leg into the other. After you finish sewing both leg pieces along the inseams, turn one of the leg pieces right side out. Then, insert this piece into the piece that still has the print side on the inside. The pieces should be aligned so that their waistbands match up and the bottom of the legs are even. Make sure the seams are all lined up as well. Sew around the edge of the crotch seam. With one pant leg inside the other, sew along the crotch area going from one side of the waistband to the other. This will connect the 2 pant legs and create the seam for the crotch. Trim off any excess threads when you finish sewing. Sew the elastic into the waist. Turn the pants right side out. Then, pin the end of the elastic strip so that it is lined up with the edge of the waistband on the back side of the pants.
