If you don't see this white pus-filled head, don't try to pop the pimple. You could damage your skin and cause an infection. The whitehead itself is already an infection, and popping it could lead to more inflammation. If your pimple is big and painful, give it a few days to develop a head. For a slightly quicker fix, apply warm compresses for about five minutes. Repeat every 3 to 4 hours for a day or two.

This will prevent your fingernails from puncturing your skin. Do this even if your nails are short. Aim for one facial tissue or table napkin for each finger. Popping the Whitehead with a Sewing Needle Disinfect a sewing needle. Be aware that popping a whitehead with a sewing needle is not recommended by dermatologists or members of the medical community, so this is something to try at your own risk. If you want to do this, then use a regular needle from a typical sewing kit. It'll be sharp enough to get the job done and minimize the risk of scarring.

Fill a saucepan about halfway full with water. Bring the water to a boil. Remove it from the burner and let it cool down for a few minutes. Place a body towel over your head and hold it out with your hands to make it form somewhat of a tent. Lower your face toward the saucepan enough to feel the steam. Allow the steam to hit your face for about five minutes. This step is easiest if the whitehead is on your face or neck. If you try it with a whitehead on your back or shoulders, it's really awkward. Stretch the skin on the whitehead. After you wrap your index fingers in tissue, place them on either side of the whitehead. Pull gently outward. At this point, it might begin to pop.

Treating the Affected Area Stop any bleeding, if necessary. The popped whitehead might bleed after you drain all the pus. If that happens, apply gentle pressure with a tissue until the bleeding stops. About five to 10 minutes should do the trick. Apply antiseptic to the pimple. Use a toner or antiseptic liquid formulated for acne. If you only have rubbing alcohol available, use it only to disinfect the area. Too much can dry out your skin. Use topical medication.
