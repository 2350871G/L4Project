The header goes directly between the king studs, so the length needs to be the same door-width-plus-5\u201d measurement that you used to place the king studs. Since the bottom of the header marks the top of the doorframe, you need to measure the vertical placement by taking the height of the door and adding 2\u201d for jambs and flooring. For example, if you have an 80\u201d door, then you\u2019d mark the placement of the bottom of header on the king stud 82\u201d from the bottom (not the top) of the bottom wall plate. Notice that the header width measurement does not include the trimmer studs. That\u2019s because the trimmer studs actually attach to the bottom of the header and not the top wall plate. To picture it, the king stud and trimmer stud will form an L around each side of the header with the king stud as the vertical line and the trimmer stud as the horizontal line. Since your trimmer studs will attach to the bottom wall plate on the bottom and header on top, they should be 80.5\u201d long for an 80\u201d door (the 82\u201d height from the bottom of the header minus the 1.5\u201d width of the bottom plate since planed 2x4s are actually 1.5\u201d wide)."
