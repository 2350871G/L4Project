If the stone does end up scratched, use non-sanded grout instead. If the grout joints are considerably larger than \u215b\" (3.2 mm) wide, consider epoxy grout instead.

It also tends to be considerably more expensive. It\u2019s usually only needed in commercial kitchens, such as the ones in restaurants.
