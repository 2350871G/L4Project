These clays work well for creating small sculptures, ornaments and pinch pots. If you are looking for a bright colored clay, polymer will be your best option. Air dry clay is a good option for all ages as it requires no use of heat. These 3 varieties of clay have a similar appearance to kiln-baked clay once they are dry."

Place the ball down on your hard surface and push it down slightly so that it has a flat bottom and can stand by itself. Gently push your thumb into the middle of the bowl to create a small dent.

Stop rolling once the coils are your desired width and length.
