Other operating systems, such as Linux are designed so they can work alongside Windows. If you have not installed an operating system on your PC, make sure you install Windows first. The exception is if you are trying to dual-boot Windows alongside macOS on a Mac. Macs are built a little different than most standard PCs and generally come with macOS already installed. Navigate to https://rufus.ie/ in a web browser. This is the web page to download Rufus which is a tool used to create a USB install drive that you can use to install an operating system on your computer.

The following links contain operating system ISO images you can download:\nWindows 10\nWindows 8\nWindows 7\nUbuntu\nLinux Mint\nDebian\n\nInstalling macOS on a non-Apple computer is more complicated than installing other operating systems, but it is possible. Insert a blank USB flash drive. Make sure the USB drive has enough space for the operating system you want to install. Also, make sure the USB drive you use doesn't have any important data that you don't want to lose. Insert the USB drive into an open USB port on your computer. Open Rufus.

Make sure you enter the minimum space required to install the new operating system. To convert GB to MB, simply multiply by 1000. For example, 40 GB is equivalent to 40,000 MB. Click Shrink.
