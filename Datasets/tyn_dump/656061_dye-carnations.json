    "text": " Dyeing Carnations Get a fresh, white carnation. Avoid using wilted ones, as they won't take up the dye as well. You can use more carnations if you want to. Cut the end of the carnation off at an angle. It would be even better if you submerged the stem in water first, then cut the ends off underwater. This will prevent air bubbles from forming at the base of the stem. Air bubbles can clog up the stem, and prevent the colored water from flowing as well. Fill a jar with warm water. You will need at least \u00bd cup (120 milliliters) of water. How much you use depends on the size of jar you are using. The flower will soak up warm water much faster than cool water. Stir in some food coloring. You will need 20 to 30 drops of food coloring per 1/2 cup (120 milliliters) of water. Stir the food coloring into the water with a spoon until the color is consistent.

Tie Dyeing Carnations Get a fresh, white carnation. Don't use a colored one, or the colors won't show up well. Also, avoid using an old, wilted carnation, or it won't soak up the water or dye.

Place the jars close together so that they are touching. Make sure that the segments are well-submerged; add more water and dye, if needed. Wait for the carnation to start changing color. This may take as little as a few hours to as long as a whole day. Keep in mind that some colors show up much faster than others. For example, if you used pink, yellow, and blue, you might see the blue show up after a few hours, and the yellow show up after a day. Take the carnation out of the dye once it's the color you want it to be. Keep in mind that carnations dyed in this manner will rarely turn out a solid color; they will usually have white streaks in them. Dip Dyeing Carnations Get some fresh, white carnations. You can dye just one carnation, if you want to, but because you will be using so much water and dye for this method, you might as well dye a whole bunch.
