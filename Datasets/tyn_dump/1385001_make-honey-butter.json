Taste the honey before you decide to use it to make honey butter, since its strong flavor will dominate the spread. Raw honey is a fine alternative to pasteurized honey. It has a deep, earthy taste and is often grainier in texture. Choose either salted or unsalted butter. If you decide to use salted butter, you can leave out the salt when you're mixing the honey and butter."

This will give it time to soften and become easier to work with. Don't use melted butter to make honey butter. Be sure the butter is still stiff enough that it's spreadable. If it melts, it could separate, leaving you with a strangely-textured final spread. To quickly bring butter to room temperature, set it in a warm, sunny window. You can also place it on the stove while something is baking in the oven - perhaps a batch of  biscuits you plan to slather with honey butter."

You can beat the ingredients with the whisk attachment on a stand mixer, or with a handheld mixer.The whisk attachment will make the honey butter fluffier.
