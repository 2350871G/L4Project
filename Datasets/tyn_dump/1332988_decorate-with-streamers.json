The back-drop may be as large or as small as you\u2019d like\u2014it will really depend on the space you\u2019re using and how you intend to capture the back-drop on camera. Ask yourself the following questions: Do you want to take full-body shots or will the pictures be from the waist up? How tall are your guests? How many guests do you want in one picture? Attach a piece of masking tape\u2014sticky side out\u2014to the wall. Stretch a piece of masking tape\u2014sticky side out\u2014along the top edge of your back-drop from corner to corner. To secure the tape to the wall, cover each end with a piece of masking tape. The streamers will hang from the sticky side of the tape. Stick streamers onto the tape. Attach streamers to the masking tape from left to right. Roll out each streamer to the desired length and cut it in a straight line.

Fringing Streamers Fold the streamer over itself to create multiple 12 inch (30.48 cm) layers. This will allow you to fringe the entire length of the streamer very quickly and efficiently. Once you reach the desired length, cut the folded streamer from the roll. Fringe your streamers. With a pair of scissors, make multiple cuts up and down the two long edges of the folded streamer.
