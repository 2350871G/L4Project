Making Jheri curls the classic way requires using chemicals that can cause permanent damage to your hair. If you apply the chemicals incorrectly, use too much, or overdo it in any way, your hair could become dry and brittle, and it might even break. This extreme hair damage is one reason why people stopped making Jheri curls the classic way in the mid-nineties.

You're essentially giving yourself a perm, which requires some skill and knowledge of hair. Whether you have your hair done at a salon or do it yourself at home, you'll need regular touch ups."
