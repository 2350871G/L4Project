To prepare the saba, cut each one into three long pieces and roll each piece lightly in brown sugar. Lay out the bowl of langka and the plated of sliced, sugared saba so you can start filling your rolls. If you can't find langka, it's ok to leave it out of this recipe. Many recipes for turon don't call for langka, though it's a common traditional ingredient. If you can't find saba, use the smallest bananas you can find. Bananas are larger than saba so you won't need as many. Saba tastes like a cross between a plantain and a banana."
