        "Tuck the stem in, then pin the flower in place.Some decorations may draw attention to your shirt.",
        "If the hole is well-covered, decorations can make your shirt look more stylish instead of damaged.",
        "Pins are also very useful for attaching fabric to holes.",
        "You could create a makeshift patch to use until you\u2019re able to install a real one.",
        "When you\u2019re in a pinch, you may not have many options.",
        "Find what you can.",
        "Consider carrying a spare clip or safety pin for emergencies.",
        "Patching a Shirt Cut a patch of fabric \u20442 in (1.3 cm) bigger than the hole.",
        "Choose a piece of fabric that matches the color of your shirt.",
        "Try matching the texture and weight of the material as well.",
        "You can buy fabric patches or cut a patch from another piece of clothing.If you\u2019re trying to patch a multicolored shirt, use a color that blends in well.",
        "For example, choose a fabric color that matches the print on the shirt.",
        "You can buy iron-on shirt patches online and at many fabric stores.",
        "Trim a piece of fusible web bonding to the same size as the patch.",
        "Place the patch on top of the fusible bonding to gauge how to cut it.",
        "Trace around it with pencil, then trim it to size with fabric scissors.",
        "The fusible bonding will be the adhesive that binds the patch to the shirt.",
        "In general, the fusible bonding should be the same size or a little smaller than the patch so it doesn\u2019t bleed through the hole.",
        "You can get fusible bonding online or at fabric stores.",
        "It comes in a sheet, similar to regular fabric.",
        "Turn the shirt inside out and place the fusible bonding over the hole.",
        "Center the fusible bonding over the hole.",
        "Make sure the hole is completely covered.",
        "The fusible bonding should overlap the hole by at least \u20444 in (0.64 cm) on all sides.",
        "If it looks a little small, cut a bigger piece.If you\u2019re having a hard time getting the fusible bonding to lay flat, iron the shirt.",
        "Also, trim away any loose thread around the hole.",
        "Place the fabric patch on top of the fusible bonding.",
        "Line up the edges of the patch with the fusible bonding beneath it.",
        "If they are slightly different sizes, double-check that the patch completely covers the fusible bonding.",
        "If it doesn\u2019t, cut a bigger patch or trim the fusible bonding a little smaller while still ensuring it covers the hole in your shirt.The fusible bonding is the glue between the pieces of fabric.",
        "It can cause the shirt to stick to your ironing board.",
        "If you\u2019re fixing a hole less than 1 in (2.5 cm) in size, you could heat the fusible bonding without the patch, then press the shirt\u2019s threads together to cover the hole.",
        "It\u2019s possible to fix the hole without making a patch, although the repair won\u2019t be as sturdy as usual.",
        "Warm the patch with an iron on a low-heat wool setting for 10 seconds.",
        "Turn the iron to the wool setting and let it heat up for about 2 minutes.",
        "Once it is warm, place it on top of the patch.",
        "Hold it still so the patch can\u2019t shift out of place.",
        "Then, turn the iron off, set it in a space spot to cool down, and check the patch.If your iron doesn\u2019t have a wool setting, mist the patch with lukewarm water to soften it and press out wrinkles.",
        "Consult the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for specifics about how to heat the fusible bonding.",
        "It can vary a little depending on which product you buy.",
        "Sewing a Hole Shut Select a type of thread that matches your shirt\u2019s color and texture.",
        "While you can use other colors if you wish, get thread that matches your shirt color so the stitching blends in as much as possible.",
        "For texture, cotton thread works well in most cases.",
        "If you\u2019re trying to fix a thinner material like chiffon or satin, use nylon or silk thread instead.Purchase thread online or from a fabric store.",
        "While you\u2019re there, make sure you have a needle and other sewing supplies.",
        "If you\u2019re trying to cover a hole more than 1 in (2.5 cm) in size, you could sew a patch onto the shirt.",
        "Another option is to darn the shirt by sewing across the hole.",
        "Thread a needle with at least 18 in (46 cm) of thread.",
        "Unroll the thread from its spool, then cut it off with a sharp pair of scissors.",
        "Take the end of the thread and slip it into the needle.",
        "Slide the needle until it\u2019s about halfway along the thread.",
        "Then, knot the thread right behind the needle.If you\u2019re having trouble threading the needle, dampen the end of the thread a little bit.",
        "You could also get a needle threader to pull the thread through the needle\u2019s eye.",
        "Poke the needle up through the fabric near the hole.",
        "Start on the top right side of the hole.",
        "Position your needle inside the shirt, then pull it up through the fabric.",
        "Keep pulling it until it\u2019s about 2 in (5.1 cm) above the shirt.",
        "Make sure the needle is about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) away from the hole so the stitches don\u2019t fall apart.If you\u2019re having a hard time positioning the needle, turn the shirt inside out.",
        "Try lifting up one of the shirt\u2019s threads and moving the needle underneath it to start the stitch.",
        "Move the needle through the fabric on the opposite side of the opening.",
        "Bring the needle down through the hole without touching the fabric first.",
        "While it\u2019s inside the shirt, position it.",
        "Pull it up through the shirt again to finish the stitch.",
        "Doing this will pull the fabric closer together, covering part of the hole.The positioning of the needle determines how big the stitches are.",
        "Smaller stitches are stronger, so don\u2019t try to bridge the entire hole unless it\u2019s very small.",
        "Stitch on opposite sides of the hole until it is completely closed.",
        "Follow the same steps to make subsequent stitches.",
        "From inside the shirt, position the needle to the left of where it initially passed through the shirt.",
        "After pulling it through, position the needle to the left of where you had it the second time to complete the initial stitch.",
        "Continue making as many stitches as needed to complete the repair.Take your time and keep your stitches as even possible.",
        "Remember to keep them at the right distance from the hole so they are strong but well-hidden.",
        "If you\u2019re darning a large hole, sew across the entire hole in one direction.",
        "Afterward, sew perpendicularly to the threads to create a woven net filling the gap in the fabric.",
        "Pull the needle inside of the shirt to knot the thread.",
        "Wrap the remaining thread around the needle about 3 times to create loops.",
        "Pull the needle through these loops to create knots.",
        "Make about 2 or 3 knots.",
        "When you\u2019re done, pull the knots toward the shirt so they won\u2019t be visible.Test the knots afterward by pulling on the thread.",
        "If it seems loose, tie it again.",
        "Make sure the knots are secure so the hole doesn\u2019t return.",
        "Cut the excess length of string to finish the repair.",
        "Pull the ends of the thread toward an opening on the shirt.",
        "Reach in and snip the thread underneath the knot.",
        "Remember that the thread has 2 \u201ctails,\u201d so cut both of them off before wearing the shirt again.If you\u2019re feeling creative, you could embroider a design on the shirt using different thread colors.",
        "It\u2019s a clever way to mask stitching by making it part of a colorful design.",
        "Use a fabric repair glue if you are unable to stitch the hole shut.",
        "Lay the shirt facedown and trim away any loose threads around the hole.",
        "Squeeze a small amount of glue onto a separate surface, such as a piece of scrap paper.",
        "Then, use something small, like a plastic knife or toothpick, to spread the glue around the hole.",
        "Squeeze the fabric together afterward for about 2 minutes until it sticks in place.Wait at least 24 hours before wearing or washing the shirt.",
        "Give the glue plenty of time to dry out.",
        "Note that glue only works for small holes and tears.",
        "It also won't be as permanent as stitching but can be less visible."
