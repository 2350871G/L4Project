Read through them carefully to make sure you don\u2019t get disqualified. Avoid using any materials that are forbidden, which may include pretreated or waxed cardboard, wood, metal, plastic, fiberglass, Styrofoam, screws, epoxy, and certain caulking compounds, glues, adhesives, or paints. There may also be size regulations or other rules that you need to follow. Many regattas insist that the crew area must be open for safety reasons in case the boat begins to sink."

Similarly, a wider boat displaces more water and will fare better than a long, narrow boat. A simple rectangular design works well! If you want a bit more flair, try making a V-shaped hull.Variation: If you want a simple boat, start with a sturdy cardboard box in any size you like (from a small shoe box to a giant refrigerator box).

Make the sides of the boat between 10 and 18 inches (25 and 46 cm) tall so that you can easily reach the water with your paddles. Base the length off of how many people are in your crew. For a small group, you can use a length of 3\u20136 feet (0.91\u20131.83 m), but for a crew of 6 or more, make the boat 10\u201312 feet (3.0\u20133.7 m) long."

For instance, if the boat is 10 feet long, 3 feet wide, and 1 foot tall, the volume is 30 cubic feet. Multiply 30 ft by 62.4 lb/ft, which is equal to 1,872 lbs.

        "When you put your boat in the water, there\u2019s a high chance that some of it will splash inside, so it\u2019s important to seal all of the cardboard.",
        "Decorate the boat to match your theme.",
        "If you\u2019re racing in a cardboard boat regatta, it\u2019s likely that you and your crew have chosen a theme for your boat.",
        "Now you get to have fun decorating the boat to match your theme.",
        "Just be sure that any additions won\u2019t damage the structural integrity of the boat or break the rules.",
        "Don\u2019t forget to paint the boat\u2019s name on the side as well!",
        "For instance, if you want your boat to look like a pirate ship, add a mast and sail, Jolly Roger flag, cannons, anchors, and a crow\u2019s nest.",
        "Put your boat in the water a few minutes before the race.",
        "Even though you may be tempted, avoid testing the boat before the regatta since the cardboard could start to deteriorate.",
        "Just before the race, carefully place your boat in the water and make sure it can\u2019t float away.",
        "Have one crew member climb in at a time.",
        "It\u2019s best to sit on your bottom in the center of the boat rather than trying to kneel or stand.",
        "Don\u2019t forget your oars and life jackets!",
        "Stay toward the back of the boat to prevent the hull from sinking."
