    "text": " Preparing the Cake Batter Preheat the oven to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) before preparing white cake mix. Purchase a white cake mix from a grocery store or big box store and follow the directions to prepare the batter. Stir the batter well in a large bowl so that there aren\u2019t any big lumps. If you\u2019d rather make your white cake mix from scratch, find a recipe online or in a cookbook. Your cake mix will likely require ingredients such as eggs, water, and oil. Decide how many layers your ombre cake will have. Your cake should have at least 3 layers so that the color change is evident in each layer, but you can choose however many you\u2019d like. How many layers you bake may depend on how many matching cake pans you have, as you\u2019ll want each layer to be the same size. If you have three cake pans that are all the same size, decide on a three-layered ombre cake. If you want 5 layers but only have 2 or 3 cake pans, you can always cook the cakes in separate batches in the oven. Divide the cake batter into the needed number of bowls. Once you\u2019ve chosen how many layers you want, pick out the same number of bowls to separate the batter. Pour the cake batter into each bowl, separating it into equal amounts. For example, for a cake with 4 layers, separate cake batter into 4 separate bowls. To help you distribute the batter evenly, put scoops of batter in each bowl one at a time. Tinting the Batter Set one bowl of cake batter aside that will stay white. This bowl will be the lightest, top layer of the cake. Make sure no food coloring goes in this bowl by setting it to the side so it's ready to go straight into the baking pan. Add 1 drop of food coloring to the next bowl of cake batter. Pour a drop of your desired color of food coloring into a new bowl of batter. Use a very small amount, as this will be the second lightest batter color. Mix the food coloring in with the batter using a spoon. For example, if you\u2019re making a blue ombre cake, pour a small drop of blue food coloring into the bowl and mix it in. Continue adding larger amounts of food coloring to the remaining bowls. In each remaining bowl, add a larger amount of food coloring to create a gradient of color with the batter. The last bowl of batter should be the brightest and darkest color, while the other bowls should each be slightly lighter. If you\u2019re making a pink ombre cake, the last bowl of batter would be a dark pink, then a regular pink, a light pink, and finally the last bowl would be white. Mix each bowl of batter thoroughly with the food coloring so that the color is seamless. Baking the Cakes Grease or add parchment paper to your cake pans.

By removing the top of the cakes, you'll create a level surface and it'll be much easier to stack them evenly. While you don't have to do this to the top layer of cake, it will make your cake look more professional. Place the first layer of cake on a plate topped with icing.

Once your darkest-colored cake is placed and has icing on top, add the next lightest cake color to the stack. Add a thin layer of icing onto this cake as well, just as you did with the first layer.

Use an offset spatula to spread a thin layer of your desired icing over the entire cake, going around the cake to create an even circle. This thin layer doesn't need to be perfect, as it won't be seen under the final layer of icing. Place the cake in the fridge after you do this for 15 minutes to help set the icing faster, if desired. Frost the cake with a single color of icing for a quick covering. Cover the cake in vanilla frosting using an offset spatula to create a smooth layer around the whole cake. If you\u2019d like the icing to match the color of the cake, use the same food coloring to dye the icing one color before spreading it on the cake. For example, if you created a purple ombre cake, use purple food coloring to dye the icing purple before spreading it evenly over the cake. Create ombre frosting by using several different gradients of frosting. If you want your icing to match the gradient on the inside of the cake, separate the icing into separate bowls just as you did the batter before adding food coloring drops to the icing. Spread the darkest shade of icing around the bottom of the cake, working your way up with lighter shades until the whitest icing is at the top.
