EVOO starts to smoke at 325-375F compared to 465F for light or refined olive oil. Since food starts to fry around 365-375F, your extra-virgin olive oil may begin to burn before it starts to fry, giving your food a bitter taste. If you have no other option, watch the oil carefully. If it starts to smoke, remove from the heat and let it cool before dumping it and trying again."

You want to choose a pan that has a flat bottom with high edges that are either sloped or straight. Be sure that it is wide enough for what you are cooking, as you will not want to overcrowd the pan. Heat the pan on medium-high. Unless you have a non-stick pan, you should heat the pan before you add the oil. This will prevent the meats from sticking to the pan.

Shallow-Frying Add an inch of cooking oil to a skillet. The oil should come halfway up the sides of the pan. Canola, vegetable, sunflower, and light olive oil work well for this type of frying. Batter the food before frying. Have the battered food ready for when the oil is hot. You can check if the oil is hot enough by sticking a wooden spoon into the oil.

Woks are ideal for this type of frying because you can cook in stages. While you can use a skillet for stir-frying, the results will not be as consistent or as tasty. Cut up your meats and vegetables. Stir-frying is similar to saut\u00e9ing in that it requires you to cut up your foods before you cook them. Make sure that all pieces are roughly the same size and weight. This will ensure uniform cooking. Have them all chopped and ready before you heat the pan. Heat up one to two tablespoons of oil.

Stir well to make sure that everything is coated. There are many types of popular sauce that you can either make or buy, such as:\nSoy sauce\nSoy ginger sauce\nOrange sauce\nHoisin sauce\nBlack bean sauce Scoop out of the pan to serve.
