Look for something round and preferably the same size as the lantern. For large lanterns, try using a big mixing bowl. You could use smaller mixing bowls, cereal bowls, or hair dye bowls for smaller lanterns. Keep in mind that the lanterns don\u2019t have to be fully submerged in the bowl. The bowl only has to be wide enough for the lantern to fit in it. Get a separate bowl for each color you plan on using. Each color has to be mixed separately."

Fabric dye is available online, but it is also sold at many hardware stores. General retailers and art supply stores also carry it.

Making patterns takes some patience and control. Try starting with the darker colors first, then carefully adding lighter colors where needed for the pattern you\u2019re creating.

        "Start off with up to 0.5 L (0.13 US gal) of lukewarm water.",
        "Pour it into the bowl and stir.",
        "Once the water is well-mixed, test the coloring with a paper towel again.",
        "If the dye is still too dark, you can continue adding more water until it reaches the correct shade.",
        "Staining the Lanterns Place a lantern in the bowl and tip it slightly.",
        "Before dying the lantern, you may wish to remove metal hangers or anything else inside it that could get in the way.",
        "After doing this, set the lantern on top of the water without submerging it.",
        "Then, tilt it to one side.",
        "Make sure the open end on one side touches the water so some of the dye gets inside of it.",
        "Most uncolored lanterns are empty and don\u2019t have hangers when you buy them, so you don\u2019t need to do anything other than open them up to begin coloring them.",
        "If you add too much dye to the lantern, it will most likely begin falling apart.",
        "Avoid submerging it.",
        "Rotate the lantern slowly if you wish to dye it a solid color.",
        "Continue holding the lantern at an angle.",
        "While holding it, begin spinning it by hand.",
        "Once it looks consistently dyed, remove it and flip it over.",
        "Tilt it so the opposite end is in the water, then spin it again to finish it.",
        "Use the open ends of the lantern to hold onto it while you\u2019re rotating it.",
        "Be careful to avoid dipping your hands into the water.",
        "Dip the lantern into different colors if you\u2019re making a pattern.",
        "Turn the lantern to the side you wish to color, then lightly touch it to the water.",
        "Make sure it absorbs some of the dye.",
        "After lifting it out of the water, rotate it to another blank spot that needs to be colored.",
        "Continue dipping it into different colors until you\u2019re done.",
        "For example, you could make dark purple spots on one end by dipping the lantern into the dye a few times.",
        "Then, fill the space between the spots with a lighter purple dye.",
        "Making patterns takes some patience and control.",
        "Try starting with the darker colors first, then carefully adding lighter colors where needed for the pattern you\u2019re creating.",
        "Another way to make designs is to let the dyed lantern dry, then paint over it with watercolors.",
        "You could use this technique to make more intricate patterns or details.",
        "Use multiple colors in order if you wish to make an ombre pattern.",
        "An ombre pattern is dark at one end and light on the other.",
        "If you plan on doing this, have all of your dyes mixed and set out in different bowls.",
        "Start by dipping one end of the lantern in the dark dye, then rotate it to color it.",
        "Move it to the next dye, tilting it to avoid staining the part you already colored.",
        "Repeat the process until you reach the last dye.",
        "For instance, you could start with a yellow dye and then work your way up to a pink or purple one.",
        "Another possibility is to leave the top part of the lantern white.",
        "Fade from an initial color to white by mixing gradually lighter dye colors.",
        "Hang the lantern for about 30 minutes to dry.",
        "String a wire through the loops on the top end of the lantern.",
        "Then, knot the wire to a hook or a rope loop.",
        "Find an open space with plenty of air circulation so the lantern is able to dry without issue.",
        "Once it feels dry to the touch, you can move it to a more permanent spot to decorate your home.",
        "Clotheslines and curtain rods are a couple of good places to hang wet lanterns.",
        "Make sure you leave enough space between the lantern and nearby walls so they don\u2019t accidentally get dyed!",
        "The lantern may drip a little as it dries.",
        "If you\u2019re drying lanterns indoors, set plastic underneath them to avoid messes."
