Add a pinch of salt to the pot right before you add the noodles and let them cook according to the time on the box, usually 10-12 minutes. Stir occasionally, every 1-2 minutes. When they are done, drain the water and set aside the noodles to cool. You will likely need you biggest pot, filled 2/3 with water, to fit the noodles. As you wait for the water to boil and noodles to cook you can move on to making the filling, however. Some companies sell \"Oven Ready\" noodles that don't need to be boiled, so be sure to read the box to check."

        "To prevent the sauce from spilling over the edge as it heats up, you can also place the entire dish on a baking tray to keep the sauce from getting on your oven.",
        "Since the dish is technically already cooked, putting it in the oven is meant to melt the cheese and let the flavors meld deliciously.",
        "That said, you can take it out when you feel like it is hot and ready to serve.",
        "Remove the foil for the last 5 minutes to brown and bubble the cheese on top.",
        "Let the lasagna sit for 10 minutes before serving.",

        "Making New Fillings Mix new flavors into your ricotta for a light taste addition.",
        "When mixing the egg into the ricotta, you can further customize the cheese to give subtle new flavors to the lasagna.",

        "1 teaspoon salt and black pepper\n1/2 cup minced parsley\n1/2 tablespoon grated nutmeg.",
        "Cook \"meaty\" vegetables into your sauce for a vegetarian option.",
        "This can be a great substitute for meat, but vegetables can also become fantastic complements to a meat sauce as well.",
        "Cook the vegetables in the oil for 5-7 minutes, until tender, along with the onions and garlic, then proceed to make the sauce like usual.",
        "If you are using it along with meat, cut the following amounts in half and cook the vegetables separately, then add to the sauce with the meat.",
        "1 large eggplant, diced.",
        "1 large zucchini, sliced.",
        "1 lb small white mushrooms, sliced.",
        "Create a layer of fried eggplant on top of the sauce.",
        "Cut your eggplant into 1/4-inch slices and fry until soft in 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil.",
        "Set aside and pat dry with a paper towel, then add the sliced eggplant after the sauce.",
        "Top with mozzarella and continue layering as normal, placing a layer of eggplant after every layer of sauce.",
        "You can also try layers of:\nRoasted butternut squash.",
        "Blanched spinach.",
        "Use polenta cakes instead of noodles for a gluten-free option.",
        "Just because you can't enjoy pasta doesn't mean you can't enjoy lasagna.",
        "Layer in thin polenta cakes instead, treating the rest of the recipe exactly as normal.",
        "Substitute spaghetti squash for noodles to make individual servings.",
        "This ingenious, low-carb recipe is not layered exactly the same way, but that doesn't make it any less delicious.",
        "To make it: \nCut the squash in half and remove the seeds.",
        "Cook the squash in a baking dish, cut-side down, for 45-60 minutes (450\u2109) or until easily pierced with a fork.",
        "Pour roughly an inch of water into the pan to prevent them from drying out.",
        "Fill each squash half with layers, starting with 1-2 dollops of ricotta, then sauce and mozzarella.",
        "Repeat until full.",
        "Cook the mini lasagnas for 20 minutes in the oven (450\u2109), until the cheese is melted on top of the squash.",
        "Use some south of the border substitutions for Mexican lasagna.",
        "You can use grilled or shredded chicken instead of beef, if you'd like, though it is not necessary.",
        "The principles are all the same as Italian lasagna, but you can get a totally different dish with some simple swaps:\nTomato Sauce \u2192 Taco Sauce\nRiccotta/Mozzarella \u2192 Queso Fresco/Cheddar\nNoodles \u2192 Corn Tortillas\nItalian seasoning \u2192 Ground Cumin, cayenne, red pepper, onion powder\nAdd 1 can of black beans and 1 can of yellow corn to sauce mixture."
