        "When the steak is done, wait before slicing it.",
        "If you cut into it right away, all the juices will flow into a delicious puddle on your cutting board.",
        "Letting the steak rest first causes it to reabsorb those juices, leading to tastier, juicier meat.",
        "You can loosely cover the steak in foil to keep it warm.",
        "This isn\u2019t necessary, and some people don\u2019t like how soft it can make the outer sear.",
        "For extra flavoring, rub the steak with 1 tablespoon (14.18 g) of butter and add salt if you didn\u2019t earlier.",
        "Slice the steak across the grain to serve it.",
        "Look closely at the steak to see which way the muscle fibers are oriented.",
        "You should be able to see small lines running diagonally along the surface.",
        "Instead of cutting along these lines, cut through them.",
        "The way you cut the meat matters.",
        "Your steak will taste much better if you cut across the grain.",
        "You\u2019ve come this far, so you might as well put on the finishing touches.",
        "Store leftover steak for up to 3 days in the refrigerator.",
        "To avoid bacterial growth, store steaks within 2 hours of cooking them.",
        "Put them in an airtight container or wrap them up in plastic or foil.",
        "Then, enjoy the leftovers before they begin looking slimy or smell rotten.",
        "Cooked steak can be stored in a sealed container in the freezer.",
        "It will last about 3 months.",
        "After 3 months, the quality starts to degrade, so try to use it before then."
