To use, simply unfold them and spread them across your carpet. You can reuse canvas drop cloths for many painting projects. While canvas is a relatively thick material, it cannot block out heavy spills. Because of this, be careful not to spill a lot of paint. Use a small amount of paint at a time, and be mindful of where your bucket or tray is at all times. Canvas drop cloths are hefty enough that you do not need to use tape. You can simply bunch them up along the walls to keep them in place. However, using masking tape ensures your drop cloth will stay put and protect your floors. You can purchase canvas drop cloths at most home supply stores in the painting aisle."
