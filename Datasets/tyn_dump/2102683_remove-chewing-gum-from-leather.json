The coldness of the ice will harden the gum, making it easier to chip away later. If the leather item is small enough, place it in a plastic bag and then put it in the freezer for about an hour. Putting the item in the freezer will have a similar effect as the ice--the gum will harden and become easier to chip away from the leather. If you don\u2019t have a plastic bag, you can rub the ice directly on the gum. Make sure that if the ice drips onto the leather, you wipe it up immediately, as water left on leather for too long can stain it."

If you chose to put your piece of leather in a bag and into the freezer, remove it and chip it away with a hard, flat-edged tool as listed above. After you have done this, proceed with all of the other steps listed in this method. Apply some saddle soap to the spot. Use a damp, clean cloth to rub some saddle soap onto the spot where the gum was until you have a light lather on the leather. Use the saddle soap to get rid of any gum remnants. Clean any remaining spot where the gum was stuck to the leather with the saddle soap lather, using circular motions to rub it into the spot. Use a toothbrush for the hard to remove bits. Scrub any small bits of gum remaining with a soft, dampened toothbrush. The toothbrush bristles will work to dislodge the lathered gum. The gum should be completely removed when you are done with the toothbrush. Remove the saddle soap lather. Wipe off the saddle soap with a second, damp clean cloth.

Use a leather conditioner on the spot after it has dried. The leather conditioner will help to ensure that there is no discoloration caused by the gum, soap lather, and damp cloth. Hair Dryer Turn your hair dryer on to high heat. Aim the nozzle of the hair dryer at the contaminated spot on your leather. Run the hot air in circular motions over the gum until the gum becomes soft. Scrape off as much gum as you can. Once the gum has warmed up, you should be able to scrape most of it off with a plastic hard-edged scraper. You could also try using an old credit card, a butter knife, or a spatula. Reheat any gum that is left. Once the gum is reheated, take a dry, clean cloth rag (one that you don\u2019t care about getting gum on) and rub the gum. Using a circular motion, you should be able to rub the gum so that it forms into little balls and wipes away easily. Use a leather cleaning product to wipe your leather down. Using a leather cleaner will help to remove any greasy residue left by the gum. Once you have wiped down the leather with the cleaner, apply some leather conditioner to moisturize the area that you applied heat to. Soap Suds Scrape away as much gum as you can. Take care not to scrape your leather\u2014use a plastic scraper, spatula, butter knife, or credit card to make sure you don\u2019t damage the leather (more than the gum already has anyway). Mix leather soap with lukewarm water. Leather soaps like Ivory Snow or Armor All work well for this. Mix the soap with the water so that it forms a thick foam. You will only be using the suds of the foam. Use a sponge to apply the suds to the gum stain. Gently rub the suds into the gum stain. Continue to rub until of the gum remnants are removed. Only apply the suds to the affected area. Dry the spot with a clean, dry towel. Once the area is dry, apply a leather conditioner to restore any discoloration created by the gum. Peanut Butter Scrape away any gum that you can. Use a hard, thin-edged tool to do this. You can use a fingernail in an emergency, but should try to find a plastic scraper, butter knife, or old credit card if you can. Mix the peanut butter before using.
