Another method for opening a coconut is to wrap the coconut in a kitchen towel and set it on a hard surface.

Coconut Milk from Desiccated Coconut Combine equal quantities of the coconut and milk or water in a saucepan. Not everyone agrees with using dairy or other plant milk to make coconut milk from; decide for yourself what you prefer. Water is just fine, as is using a plant milk. Simmer gently for 2-4 minutes on low heat. Stir frequently. Do not allow to boil. Strain through a sieve that is lined with muslin or cheesecloth. Pour the liquid into a bowl.

Transfer the grated coconut flesh into a blender.  Add 1 1/4 cups of hot water.  Pulse to blend. Only pulse for a few seconds. It's wise to push down on the lid with a piled-up tea towel while pulsing, to prevent the lid from blasting off due to the heat in the container. Remove the coconut pieces. Push the contents through a muslin- or cheesecloth-lined sieve. Pour the thick milk into a glass jar for storage in the refrigerator. Or, use straight away in your dish or drink.",
