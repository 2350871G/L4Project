Use scissors to cut a hole through the pi\u00f1ata's opening, which is usually on the back and covered by a sticker. Then, insert candy, toys, or other small prizes into the pi\u00f1ata by pushing the items through the hole. Some examples of treats and toys you can use are gummies, hard candies, plastic rings, and tiny candy bars. Push a 10 ft (3.0 m) piece of rope through the loop on the pi\u00f1ata's top. Find the loop attached to the top of the pi\u00f1ata and thread the end of a piece of rope through the loop. Then, tie the rope in a double knot to secure it to the pi\u00f1ata. Choose a low-hanging location with plenty of open space around it. Low-hanging tree branches are good options, or you can hang the pi\u00f1ata from a basketball hoop or patio beam. Make sure you choose something sturdy! For example, if you're hanging the pi\u00f1ata from a tree, choose one of the main branches and make sure there are no rotten spots. Make sure the location has plenty of open space around it so the kids have ample room to swing the bat or stick at the pi\u00f1ata. Throw the loose end of the rope over the branch, hoop, or porch beam. The pi\u00f1ata should be on one side of the branch and the loose end of the rope should be on the other. Pull the end of the rope to lift the pi\u00f1ata off the ground so that it's out of the children\u2019s reach. Secure the loose end of the rope until it\u2019s time to play the game. Tie the dangling loose end of the rope to something sturdy, such as a nearby pole or tree. Be sure to tie the knot loosely, since you'll soon need to untie it! Additionally, make sure the rope isn't in the way of your party goers. Untie the loose end of the rope and lower the pi\u00f1ata to start the game. Take control of the other end of the rope and lower it so the blindfolded players can reach it with their bats. You can also lower and raise the pi\u00f1ata with the rope to change things up and challenge the partygoers! Make sure the blindfolded child doesn\u2019t hit other children with the stick by accident! Using a Pi\u00f1ata Tripod Assemble the tripod\u2019s legs by connecting their pieces together. Assembly will vary, but it will probably involve snapping the leg pieces together before adding small screws to secure the legs in place. There will be tiny holes for the screws. You can usually rent a pi\u00f1ata tripod from most party supply stores. Make sure you choose a large area with plenty of open space for the pi\u00f1ata, such as an open area of the lawn. Party goers should be able to swing at the pi\u00f1ata in any direction and not be remotely close to hitting anything other than the pi\u00f1ata. Stand the tripod upright on the ground. Extend the legs evenly on flat ground to ensure it doesn\u2019t wobble or fall over when party guests are using it. Most tripods come with supporting feet at the bottom of the legs, so you don't need to insert the legs into the ground to hold them in place.

You can also tie the rope to something sturdy when the pi\u00f1ata is at the desired height. Making a Hanging Hook Cut a wire hanger in half lengthwise with pliers. Needle nose pliers or fencing pliers will work for this. Keep the top half of the hanger to use for the pi\u00f1ata\u2019s hook and discard the bottom half. You can also use sturdy craft wire that you cut from a spool yourself and craft the end just like the hook of a hanger. Cut out a thin piece of cardboard to use as a mount and bend it into shape. You can cut a thin piece of cardboard from a cereal box or any kind of cardboard box. The cardboard can be any shape, as long as it can be shaped to fit the top part of the pi\u00f1ata. For example, the cardboard from a postal service box will work for this project. Poke the hanger through the cardboard and fix it in place with pliers. Use pliers to bend the tip of the hanger straight to insert it through the cardboard. Then, bend the ends of the hanger over the cardboard. Fold the ends of the wire as flat as possible so they don\u2019t poke out. Assemble the inside of your pi\u00f1ata. Arrange the goodies in the shape you want and use masking tape to hold them in place. Then, wrap the taped shape with newspaper to get it ready for the application of papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9. Attach the cardboard to the top of the pi\u00f1ata shape. Use masking tape to secure the hanger mount to the top of the pinata at the place where it will be suspended. All of the cardboard's edges should be completely secured to the pinata innards with the masking tape. Curl the hanger hook into a closed loop using pliers. Bend the tip into a complete circle with enough extra wire at the end to twist around itself. Secure the hook in place by bending the wire around the lower part of the hook as tight as possible. Build the pi\u00f1ata with papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 around the cardboard mount. The layers of papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 you use to create the pi\u00f1ata will secure the cardboard mount inside of the pi\u00f1ata. Make sure not to apply papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 over the hook itself so it will be exposed. Hang your pi\u00f1ata from a secure place with a rope.
