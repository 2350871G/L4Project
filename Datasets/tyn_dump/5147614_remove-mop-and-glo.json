You will need to have access to all the areas that were covered in Mop and Glo. Open all the windows. Although this method is non-toxic, mixing a vinegar solution leads to a strong smell. Pour 1/2 cup (118ml) of white vinegar into one gallon (3.8l) of hot water. The water should be cool enough that you can submerge your hands in it. The vinegar is acidic and it brings up the waxy residue from the Mop and Glo. Add several drops of lemon, orange or clove essential oils. These oils subdue the harsh vinegar smell. Fill another bucket with clean warm water for rinsing.  Dip a microfiber cloth in the bucket and wring it out. Keep the amount of solution and water you use to a minimum to keep the subfloor from getting wet and the wood from warping. Start scrubbing from the farthest corner until you come to the doorway. Rinse sections of the floor with clean microfiber cloths after the solution sits for a five to 10 minutes. The vinegar needs a few minutes to break through the residue. Make sure to rinse well. Removing Mop and Glo From Laminate Vacuum the laminate floor to remove dust and debris. You don\u2019t want anything to remain that could scuff the surface.
