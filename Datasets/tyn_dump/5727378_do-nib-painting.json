The remaining items needed are listed at the end of the article. Lay down a felt cloth on a piece of strong cardboard. Glue it in place. This becomes the work board that you can use again and again for the paintings. Try out the nibs. Do some small and simple painting to get a feel for how the nibs work with the oil paints.

This area will not be painted, so check the size against the frame you'd like to use before you begin painting. Lay over the felt piece in readiness for drawing and painting on. Painting the cloth Make a rough sketch on the cloth of your desired image. You can either mark this directly onto the fabric, or use tracing paper and transfer the image to the fabric. Take about 0.5 cm of paint from the oil paint tube. Place it on your index finger. For smoothing the paint, use the nib and rub the paint in the same manner as you'd mix sugar into milk. Dab a small part of this paint on the nib. Start applying the paint from nib onto the cloth, in its respective place. While painting, you will note that it appears like a line. You have to paint like this all over, continuously adding more lines to form the image parts. You can mix two colors while painting, to get beautiful shading in the scenery or image.
