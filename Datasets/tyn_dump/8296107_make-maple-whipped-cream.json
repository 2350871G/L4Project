                    "description": "Place a large mixing bowl in the refrigerator for 30 minutes, preferably a stainless steel bowl because it chills faster. Chilling your mixing bowl before whipping your cream helps the cream to thicken faster and makes it easier to whip. Make sure that the cream you are going to use has been refrigerated for a couple of hours. Use heavy whipping cream as opposed to half and half or other varieties of milk or cream."

                    "description": "To beat the cream, use your non-dominant hand to hold the edge of the mixing bowl and tilt it slightly. Use your dominant hand to whip the cream with the whisk in rapid circular motions. When whipping the cream, get momentum from your wrist rather than moving your whole arm. You need to whip rapidly and work quickly, before the cream has time to warm up. Try to whip and disrupt the cream without splashing the cream. Instead of repeatedly taking the whisk out of the cream at the beginning of every circular motion, keep the head of the whisk in the cream as you whip. You can also use a hand-mixer to whip the cream. To use a hand-mixer, turn the setting up to high and move the mixer in circular motions. You don't have to whisk as rapidly as you do when whipping using a whisk, because the mixer will churn the cream for you."

You can tell that your whipped cream is forming stiff peaks when the hill-like masses of cream look solid as opposed to liquid-y and soft. Make sure not to whip for too long after the soft peaks become stiff. If you whip your cream for too long a time, it will become butter!"
