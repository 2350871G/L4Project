When it's your turn and you put down your cards, you have to say, \"One ace,\" \"two twos,\" or \"three kings,\" and so on. You may not actually have the cards that you need to put down -- the fun is in faking it. If you don't have any of the required cards, you can skip your turn though, it's better not to pretend to put down 3 of them -- and definitely not four. If you say you've put down 3 of a card you don't have, it's likely that a player will have at least 2 of the card and will know you're lying and will call \"bullshit!\" You can also play dumb. Let's say it's your turn to put down queens, and you happen to have two of them. Say, \"What am I again?\" and look confused as you look through your cards before you put them down. Your goal is to make people believe you when you're lying, and make them doubt you when you're telling the truth."

This entails an accusation and reveal, in which the person who just played is required to turn over the cards they just put and show everyone else what they actually are. If the cards aren't what the player said they were and the person who called \"bullshit\" was right, the lying player takes all the cards from the pile and adds them to their hand. If the cards are what the player said they were and the accuser turns out to be wrong, all of the cards in the pile go into the hand of the accuser.
