Make a 2 to 5cm-wide (1-2 inch-wide) strip of fabric. Alternatively, if using the ribbon, skip this step. Wrap the strip or ribbon around the headband. Tie and tuck under at the end, trim to neaten. Apply a dab of fabric glue to prevent unraveling. Draw two elephant ear shapes on paper, one facing left, one facing right. Use either an online image to trace over or simply draw from your imagination. Cut out the ear shapes to make into a template.  Pin the templates to the fabric. Cut out two elephant ear shapes, two of the left facing and two of the right facing shapes. Pin the left ear together, wrong side facing out. Do the same for the right side.
