This rhythm is established by following a predictable routine, which is why you are able to wake up at the same time on the weekend as you are during the week if all factors are equal. So the best way to adjust your sleep cycle is to be consistent and make it a routine. Take care not to deprive yourself of sleep. There are many studies about the dangers of sleep deprivation so talk to your medical professional before attempting to change your sleep schedule for a long period of time. More sleep isn't always healthier than less sleep. Scientists don\u2019t know whether sleeping longer is a symptom of poor health or the cause of it. Consult your health professional to see if there is a deeper concern as to why you are staying in bed longer such as sleep apnea or depression."
