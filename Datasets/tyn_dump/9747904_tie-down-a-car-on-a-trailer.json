Then, put the vehicle you used to tow the trailer in park and activate its emergency brake. For extra security, place wheel chocks in front of and behind each tire. Extend the trailer\u2019s rear ramps. If you\u2019re using a trailer made specifically for towing cars, it should come with 2 heavy duty ramps.

Park the car and check its placement. Keep driving until you\u2019re centered on the trailer. Then, put the car in park, turn it off, and activate its parking brake.

If you have a manual car, put it in first gear, turn off the motor, and set the handbrake. Securing the Car with Tire Straps Use tire straps to secure modern or small vehicles. Tire straps use your trailer\u2019s weight to keep your car steady. When properly attached, these straps cannot damage your car\u2019s body or mechanical parts, making them perfect for slender cars made after 1990 and small vehicles like smart cars. Tire straps may not fit on vehicles with extremely large tires. Wrap a lasso strap around your car\u2019s left front tire. Grab a lasso strap and pull the open end of the strap through the looped end. Then, place the strap around your tire and pull it tight. Make sure the strap covers your tire\u2019s hubcap. Thread the lasso strap through a ratchet strap. Pull the exposed end of your lasso strap through the center hole of a ratchet strap buckle, making sure to leave just a little bit of slack. Then, crank the ratchet\u2019s handle 3 or 4 times to connect the straps. If your ratchet strap has 2 metal clips, hook 1 of them onto the looped end of the lasso strap. Hook the ratchet strap onto the left front D-ring. Once you\u2019ve connected the straps, look for your trailer\u2019s left front D-ring. Then, hook the open end of your ratchet strap onto the D-ring. D-rings are small, inset rings bolted onto each corner of your trailer. Tighten the straps by ratcheting them. Double-check that both your ratchet strap and lasso strap are secure and connected. Then, move the ratchet\u2019s handle up and down to tighten the straps. When finished, your lasso strap should squeeze into the tire\u2019s sides. While tightening your straps, make sure they don\u2019t come into contact with your car\u2019s body. If they do, loosen the straps, reposition them, and repeat the tightening process. Repeat the process with each wheel. Once you\u2019ve finished the first wheel, repeat the fastening process with your 3 remaining tires. When you\u2019re finished, look over each wheel to ensure you didn\u2019t make any errors. You can fasten the remaining wheels in any order you\u2019d like. Using Axle Straps Use axle straps to secure large or old vehicles. Unlike tire straps, axle straps use your vehicle\u2019s weight and suspension to help keep it in place. This is typically the best option for bulky classic cars produced before 1990 and large vehicles like trucks and four wheelers. Axle straps can cause unwanted damage to small or modern vehicles. Wrap an axle strap around your car\u2019s rear axle. Pull an axle strap around the left side of your car\u2019s rear axle bar. Then, secure it by closing the strap\u2019s metal clip. If your strap has a padded section, make sure that section is the part that touches the axle. Your car\u2019s rear housing holds its rear axle, which is the long horizontal bar that connects the back wheels. Clip a ratchet strap to the trailer\u2019s left rear D-ring. Grab a ratchet strap that has a metal clip on the end. Connect the clip to the D-ring on the back left side of the trailer, then give it a tug to make sure it holds. D-rings are the inset rings bolted onto the trailer. They\u2019re generally located on each corner of the vehicle. Thread the axle strap into the ratchet. Pull the free end of your axle strap through the ratchet buckle\u2019s center hole, leaving just a small amount of slack. Then, raise and lower the ratchet\u2019s handle 3 or 4 times to lock the strap in place. If your ratchet strap has a second metal clip, hook it onto the axle strap\u2019s metal ring (the part you tied to the rear axle housing). Ratchet the straps to make them taut. Check to make sure that your straps are secure and completely connected. Then, move the ratchet\u2019s handle up and down until the straps are fairly taut. Make sure to keep the straps straight and don\u2019t twist them as you tighten, since twisting can make unloading more difficult. Overtightening the straps can lead to axle damage. If your straps feel like they\u2019re starting to strain, loosen them slightly. If you\u2019re left with any loose strap ends, tie them up using bungee cords or cable ties. Repeat the process on the rear right side. Grab a second axle strap and a second ratchet strap. Then, repeat the fastening process by wrapping the axle strap around the right side of the rear axle, hooking the ratchet strap onto the adjacent D-ring, and connecting the straps together. Just like with the previous side, make sure the straps are tight enough to secure the car but not so tight that they strain the axle. Tie down the front axle. Grab 2 more axle straps and 2 more ratchet straps. Then, wrap the axle straps around the left and right sides of the front axle, clip the ratchet straps into the adjacent D-rings, and connect the corresponding straps together. Finally, ratchet the straps until they\u2019re tight with no slack. If you\u2019d prefer, you can wrap the front axle straps around your car\u2019s A-arms or chassis rail. Be careful not to secure any straps around the car\u2019s sway bars, steering arms, or steering racks. These are located on the bottom of the car and look like small axle rods. Checking the Car\u2019s Safety Attach, but do not tighten, your trailer\u2019s safety chain. If your trailer has a rear safety chain, make sure you attach it to the front of your car.

You do not need to tighten the chain, just make sure it\u2019s attached securely. This chain helps hold your car in place if any of the straps break. Check your straps.

        "Securing the Car with Tire Straps Use tire straps to secure modern or small vehicles.",
        "Tire straps use your trailer\u2019s weight to keep your car steady.",
        "When properly attached, these straps cannot damage your car\u2019s body or mechanical parts, making them perfect for slender cars made after 1990 and small vehicles like smart cars.",
        "Tire straps may not fit on vehicles with extremely large tires.",
        "Wrap a lasso strap around your car\u2019s left front tire.",
        "Grab a lasso strap and pull the open end of the strap through the looped end.",
        "Then, place the strap around your tire and pull it tight.",
        "Make sure the strap covers your tire\u2019s hubcap.",
        "Thread the lasso strap through a ratchet strap.",
        "Pull the exposed end of your lasso strap through the center hole of a ratchet strap buckle, making sure to leave just a little bit of slack.",
        "Then, crank the ratchet\u2019s handle 3 or 4 times to connect the straps.",
        "If your ratchet strap has 2 metal clips, hook 1 of them onto the looped end of the lasso strap.",
        "Hook the ratchet strap onto the left front D-ring.",
        "Once you\u2019ve connected the straps, look for your trailer\u2019s left front D-ring.",
        "Then, hook the open end of your ratchet strap onto the D-ring.",
        "D-rings are small, inset rings bolted onto each corner of your trailer.",
        "Tighten the straps by ratcheting them.",
        "Double-check that both your ratchet strap and lasso strap are secure and connected.",
        "Then, move the ratchet\u2019s handle up and down to tighten the straps.",
        "When finished, your lasso strap should squeeze into the tire\u2019s sides.",
        "While tightening your straps, make sure they don\u2019t come into contact with your car\u2019s body.",
        "If they do, loosen the straps, reposition them, and repeat the tightening process.",
        "Repeat the process with each wheel.",
        "Once you\u2019ve finished the first wheel, repeat the fastening process with your 3 remaining tires.",
        "When you\u2019re finished, look over each wheel to ensure you didn\u2019t make any errors.",
        "You can fasten the remaining wheels in any order you\u2019d like.",
        "Using Axle Straps Use axle straps to secure large or old vehicles.",
        "Unlike tire straps, axle straps use your vehicle\u2019s weight and suspension to help keep it in place.",
        "This is typically the best option for bulky classic cars produced before 1990 and large vehicles like trucks and four wheelers.",
        "Axle straps can cause unwanted damage to small or modern vehicles.",
        "Wrap an axle strap around your car\u2019s rear axle.",
        "Pull an axle strap around the left side of your car\u2019s rear axle bar.",
        "Then, secure it by closing the strap\u2019s metal clip.",
        "If your strap has a padded section, make sure that section is the part that touches the axle.",
        "Your car\u2019s rear housing holds its rear axle, which is the long horizontal bar that connects the back wheels.",
        "Clip a ratchet strap to the trailer\u2019s left rear D-ring.",
        "Grab a ratchet strap that has a metal clip on the end.",
        "Connect the clip to the D-ring on the back left side of the trailer, then give it a tug to make sure it holds.",
        "D-rings are the inset rings bolted onto the trailer.",
        "They\u2019re generally located on each corner of the vehicle.",
        "Thread the axle strap into the ratchet.",
        "Pull the free end of your axle strap through the ratchet buckle\u2019s center hole, leaving just a small amount of slack.",
        "Then, raise and lower the ratchet\u2019s handle 3 or 4 times to lock the strap in place.",
        "If your ratchet strap has a second metal clip, hook it onto the axle strap\u2019s metal ring (the part you tied to the rear axle housing).",
        "Ratchet the straps to make them taut.",
        "Check to make sure that your straps are secure and completely connected.",
        "Then, move the ratchet\u2019s handle up and down until the straps are fairly taut.",
        "Make sure to keep the straps straight and don\u2019t twist them as you tighten, since twisting can make unloading more difficult.",
        "Overtightening the straps can lead to axle damage.",
        "If your straps feel like they\u2019re starting to strain, loosen them slightly.",
        "If you\u2019re left with any loose strap ends, tie them up using bungee cords or cable ties.",
        "Repeat the process on the rear right side.",
        "Grab a second axle strap and a second ratchet strap.",
        "Then, repeat the fastening process by wrapping the axle strap around the right side of the rear axle, hooking the ratchet strap onto the adjacent D-ring, and connecting the straps together.",
        "Just like with the previous side, make sure the straps are tight enough to secure the car but not so tight that they strain the axle.",
        "Tie down the front axle.",
        "Grab 2 more axle straps and 2 more ratchet straps.",
        "Then, wrap the axle straps around the left and right sides of the front axle, clip the ratchet straps into the adjacent D-rings, and connect the corresponding straps together.",
        "Finally, ratchet the straps until they\u2019re tight with no slack.",
        "If you\u2019d prefer, you can wrap the front axle straps around your car\u2019s A-arms or chassis rail.",
        "Be careful not to secure any straps around the car\u2019s sway bars, steering arms, or steering racks.",
        "These are located on the bottom of the car and look like small axle rods.",
        "Checking the Car\u2019s Safety Attach, but do not tighten, your trailer\u2019s safety chain.",
        "If your trailer has a rear safety chain, make sure you attach it to the front of your car.",
        "To do this, pull the chain around your car\u2019s chassis rail or A-arm.",
        "Then, twist the chain and clip the chain hook onto 1 of the chain loops.",
        "You do not need to tighten the chain, just make sure it\u2019s attached securely.",
        "This chain helps hold your car in place if any of the straps break.",
        "Check your straps.",
        "Check your straps to make sure they\u2019re tight and are only holding down things they\u2019re supposed to.",
        "In particular, make sure your straps are not crushing your car\u2019s body, brake lines, or oil lines.",
        "You\u2019ll find brake and oil lines on the bottom of your car.",
        "They typically look like thin, flexible cords.",
        "Stow and secure the trailer\u2019s ramps.",
        "If you used connected ramps, push them back into their holding place.",
        "If you used an external ramp, move it out of the way and either stow it somewhere safe or put in the trunk of your towing vehicle.",
        "Make sure to stow the ramps before you drive away!",
        "Test drive your trailer in a safe area.",
        "Before you head out, drive your trailer through a slow, quiet area like a neighborhood or empty parking lot.",
        "In addition to making sure the car is secure, use this time to practice things like braking, making wide turns, and backing up.",
        "If you\u2019ve never towed a trailer before, you should also test drive it before loading the car.",
        "Stop and adjust your straps after driving 10 to 25 miles.",
        "For safety, stop and check your straps after traveling your first 10 to 25 miles.",
        "If necessary, secure your straps by repositioning or ratcheting them.",
        "Ratchet straps tend to stretch out a bit when you first start using them.",
        "Check your straps whenever you stop for fuel or food.",
        "Perform regular inspections throughout your trip, checking for any slack in the straps and making sure they\u2019re properly positioned.",
        "You should also inspect the towing vehicle for overheated or low-pressure tires.",
        "Taking just 10 minutes to check at each stop will help keep you, your car, and your trailer safe."
