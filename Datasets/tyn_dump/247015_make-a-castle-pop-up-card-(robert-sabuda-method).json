Use a ruler as a guide and take the rounded end of a paper clip (or ballpoint pen that has run out of ink) and press along the dotted lines of the pop-up pieces and card.  Carefully cut out the pop-up pieces and castle card following the solid, black lines.  Use the tip of your scissor to poke through the drawbridge area and cut it out from the main castle pop-up piece.  Fold the castle card in half and then open it. Set it aside. Fold the top left tab of the main castle pop-up piece back away from you. Crease with your thumb or finger. Place it back to its original position.  Repeat the step with the same tab this time on the second dotted line, folding it back away from you.  Release it back to its original position. Apply the same steps with the top right tab on the other side. Apply a small amount of glue on the card to the top two grey squares marked \"glue here\" on the left and right sides only.  Fold the top left tab back and place it on top of the corresponding left grey square.  Press firmly and let the glue dry. Repeat for the other side. Fold up the first tab at the bottom of your main castle pop up piece. Crease with your finger. Then put the tab back to its original position. Fold up the next tab. Crease with your finger. Place it back to its original position.  Fold the second dotted line up on the same tab, creasing with your finger.  Place it back to its original position.  Fold up the third dotted line on the same tab, creasing with your finger.  Place it back to its original position.  Fold up the next tab over, creasing with your finger, then place it back to its original position.  Fold the tab with the drawbridge up at the base. Crease with your finger. Fold the preceding dotted line up and crease with your finger. Then place it back to its original position. Fold up the last preceding dotted line on the drawbridge tab and crease with your finger. Then place it back to its original position. Repeat the same creasing steps on the last three tabs on the other side.  Place a small amount of glue on the grey areas marked \"glue here.\"  Align the bottom tabs of your main pop-up piece with the matching grey areas. Press firmly and be sure let the glue dry. Place your fingers under the castle piece and raise the piece forward.  Fold the castle card in half and press firmly. Open the card and lay it flat. Apply glue to the center of the main castle. Glue the middle-sized piece to the center of the main castle. Press firmly and let dry. Apply a small amount of glue to the side tabs of the main castle piece.  Glue the small castle tower pieces on top, press firmly and let the glue dry.  Place fingers under the castle piece and raise the piece forward. Then fold the card in half and press firmly. Open the card. Congratulate yourself. Castle pop-up is now finished! Long live the King and Queen! Finished. ",
