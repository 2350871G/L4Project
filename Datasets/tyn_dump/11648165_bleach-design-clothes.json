    "text": " Making Stencils and Designs Grab a clothing item that is made of mostly cotton or linen. Bleach works the best on articles of clothing that are made up of cotton or linen, since bleach adheres well to those fibers. Avoid using high-quality materials like silk or velvet. You can use any color clothing item that you\u2019d like besides white. Print out or draw a design onto normal paper. Choose any design that you\u2019d like to and either draw in pencil or print it out onto a plain sheet of white paper. Make your design large and not too intricate so that it shows up well on your item of clothing.Tip: If you are using any words in your design, it is best to stick with block letters. If you have a Cricut maker, you can use it to cut letters and designs out of freezer paper. This is great for more intricate, detailed designs. Turn the paper over and lay it face down on a sheet of freezer paper. Freezer paper has 2 sides to it. 1 side is plain paper that you can write on and the other has a waxy coating on it. Lay your paper with a design on it on the waxy side of the freezer paper. You can find freezer paper in the baking section of most grocery stores. Cut out your design in freezer paper using a razor blade. Set your freezer paper and design onto a rubber cutting mat so that you don\u2019t damage any surfaces in your home. Use a razor blade to carefully cut your design out in the freezer paper. A razor blade will help you get the most detail in your design. Use painter\u2019s tape for a geometric design. If you want to make stripes, squares, or triangles on your clothing item, place thin pieces of painter\u2019s tape onto your shirt or pants instead of a stencil. Make sure you press your tape fully onto the clothing item so that no bleach can leak through. You can also use painter\u2019s tape to make simple letters. Bleaching Your Design Place a piece of cardboard on the inside of your clothing item. Lay your item of clothing out on a flat surface. Put a piece of cardboard in between the front and the back of your clothing item. This will help to protect the other side of your shirt, pants, or sweatshirt. Lay your design onto your clothing item and pass over it with an iron. Position your design in the area where you\u2019d like it to go on your clothing item.

Tie-Dying with Bleach Lay a black item of clothing out on a flat surface. Tie-dying with bleach shows up the best on a black item of clothing. Lay it out on a flat surface, like a table, where you can work with it easily.Tip: You can use a black item of clothing that has a design on it if you want a pop of color. Grab the middle of the clothing item and twist it inwards and around itself. Use 1 hand to pinch the middle section of your clothing item and pull it slightly upwards. Wrap the item of clothing around this middle section until it creates a loose circle. You can also roll the item of clothing up in on itself to create a different pattern with your bleach. Wrap 5 to 10 rubber bands around your item to keep it twisted. Use large, thick rubber bands that are sturdy enough to stay in place. Wrap a few around your item of clothing until it stays in place and isn\u2019t likely to come undone as you work on it. You can buy rubber bands at most home goods or office supply stores. Make a 1:1 ratio of bleach and water in a squirt bottle. Put on gloves to protect your hands. Use a squirt bottle with a small opening so that you can control the spray of bleach. Pour 1 part bleach and 1 part water into your squirt bottle. Pour your bleach mixture over your item of clothing. Protect your surfaces by placing your clothing item into a container that won\u2019t be harmed by bleach, like a plastic bucket or tub.
