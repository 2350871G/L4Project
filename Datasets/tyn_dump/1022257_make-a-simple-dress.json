Next, measure around your hips at their widest point. Add 1-2\" to the shoulder-hem measurement and at least 4\" to the hip measurement, for seam allowances (more if your shoulders are broader than your hips). If you want the skirt to be a bit more full, add 6-8\". For example, let's say that from my shoulder down to my knee (where I want my hem) is 40\" and my hips are 36\" around. This means that I will want a piece of fabric that is ideally 42\" wide and 42\" long, although it can also be 42x21 and still work. Technically the fabric will be broken down into four identical rectangles (one side length measurement by one quarter hip measurement, plus seam allowances). That means that as long as you have four pieces of fabric in that rectangle size, you can use them just fine. Traditional seam allowance is 1/2\" along each edge."

White or brightly colored summer fabrics are most traditional, but you can also use an old tablecloth, curtains, or scarves too. Stretchy fabrics like jersey work well for this dress but are difficult to work with. You need very particular settings on your sewing machine (most notably a perfectly set, loose-but-not-too-loose foot). Tread carefully."

Using the measurements from the first step, our example rectangles would need to be 42\" long and 10.5\" wide."
