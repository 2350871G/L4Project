You can also make your own strap material out of the same fabric you used for your bag, if you made the bag yourself. To make your own strap material out of fabric, cut a piece of fabric to about 1.5 times the desired maximum length and double the desired width of your strap. Then, iron fusible interfacing onto the inside of the strap to fortify it. Sew a straight stitch along the raw edges of the strap with the wrong (inner) sides facing out, and then invert the strap. Fusible interfacing is available at craft supply stores. It is a type of fabric that you can iron onto the inside of an item to reinforce it, making it stiffer and stronger."

Fusible interfacing is available at craft supply stores. It is a type of fabric that you can iron onto the inside of an item to reinforce it, making it stiffer and stronger. Cut your strap into one long and one short strap piece. Cut the strap you just sewed into two pieces: one that is about 3 in (7.6 cm) longer than your desired maximum length, and a second strap that is about 6 in (15 cm) long. For example, if you want to be able to adjust your strap up to 20 in (51 cm) long, then cut a long strap piece that is 23 in (58 cm). Fold the short piece around the metal rectangle.
