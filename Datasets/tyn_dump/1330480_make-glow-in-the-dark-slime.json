    "text": " Making Slime with Borax or Liquid Starch Pour the hot water into a medium-sized bowl. The water doesn\u2019t need to be boiling hot, but it should be warm to the touch. Add the clear glue. You can also use white glue, but the color of the slime won\u2019t be as vivid. Choose non-toxic glue, particularly if children will be handling the slime. Add the glow-in-the-dark paint and stir to combine. You can find glow-in-the-dark paint in most craft stores or in the crafting section of major stores. You can also use highlighter ink as an alternative to the paint. Just pry off the bottom of the highlighter and drop the ink filament into the bowl of hot water and borax. With a gloved hand, squeeze the filament to extract the ink. Note that if using highlighter ink, it may only glow under a blacklight. Add the borax (available in most laundry aisles) to the separate bowl of hot water. Stir to combine. As an alternative to the borax and water, you can simply add 1/2 cup liquid starch, also available in the laundry aisle. Mix in the borax solution. Gradually add the borax solution into the paint solution, 2 tablespoons at a time, stirring continuously, until desired consistency is achieved. Store in a zipper bag or an airtight container. If you don\u2019t store the slime properly, it will begin to dry out. Leaving the slime in an open container just overnight, though, can help the consistency become more rubbery if so desired. Finished! Enjoy your glow-in-the-dark slime! Making Slime with Cornstarch Pour the cornstarch into a medium-sized bowl. You can also use less cornstarch to produce a more watery slime. Because you\u2019re using cornstarch rather than borax or liquid starch, this slime is a safe alternative for small children. Add the water to the bowl of cornstarch. Stir with a spoon or with hands to combine. Add the craft paint. Continue stirring until the desired consistency is achieved. Glow-in-the-dark craft paint is available at most craft stores as well as in the crafting section of many major stores. As an alternative to glow-in-the-dark paint, you can instead use the ink from a highlighter to color your slime.

You can also add drops of food coloring to change the hue of the slime, just remember that the food coloring may make the slime glow a little less. Finished! Enjoy your glow-in-the-dark slime! Making Slime with Epsom Salts Combine the water and Epsom salt in a medium bowl. Stir until most of the Epsom salt has dissolved into the water. Add the liquid glue and stir to combine. Clear glue will result in a brighter color of slime than will white glue. Remember to choose non-toxic glue if small children will be involved. Add the craft paint. Stir the mixture to combine and continue stirring until the desired consistency is achieved. Highlighter ink can be an alternative to craft paint. Simply pull the bottom off a highlighter and drop the ink filament into the slime mixture. Using gloves, squeeze the ink filament to get the ink out.
