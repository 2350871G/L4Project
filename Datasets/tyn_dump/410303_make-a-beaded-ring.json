If you are interested in using a thicker gauge wire, you should be sure the beads you purchase fit the thicker wire. Size 15/0 seed beads (1.3 mm) should usually be able to fit on 16 gauge wire and thinner. Larger seed beads, like size 6/0 (3.3 mm), will accommodate thicker wire, in this case eight gauge and thinner. Due to differences in the finishing process of seed beads used by bead producers, seed bead diameters are only an approximation, and may require thicker or thinner wire."
