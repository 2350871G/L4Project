        "Better yet, invest in a captain's bed and save even more space.",
        "Get book shelves.",
        "Even if your child is too young to read now, you should have lots of books that you can read to them and room for books to go in the future.",
        "Bookshelves are also useful for storing other items, like stuffed animals, dolls, or personal items.",
        "Although one thing about this is what type of book it also depends on them so you need to be careful here!",
        "Get an organizer.",
        "A toy organizer, which is usually a series of colorful tubs on a shelf, is a great way to help create more space on the floor for your child to play.",
        "As they get older, it can be moved from organizing toys to organizing school papers or even clothes.",
        "Get laundry baskets if you haven't already invested in them.",
        "Put some laundry baskets in your child's room and encourage them to use the baskets.",
        "This will help keep clothes off the floor, giving them more space to play and lounge around.",
        "Encouraging Study Set aside a space for study.",
        "Your child should have a space that's dedicated to working on homework.",
        "This will help remove temptations and distractions so that they can focus on what's most important.",
        "By having a dedicated study space, you'll help them build good habits and know that they have to focus when they're in that space.",
        "For most kids this would mean having a desk in their room, but your child might do better with squishy floor seating like a bean bag chair and a lap desk.",
        "Make sure it isn't distracting.",
        "Their study area should be as distraction free as possible.",
        "This means it should not have toys or too many decorations too close by, and avoid putting it near major hallways or facing windows.",
        "It will also need to be well organized, with storage and places to keep everything they need.",
        "Create a comfortable desk.",
        "Make the desk area that you set aside for them as comfortable as possible.",
        "Having a sore bum can really make you not want to do homework anymore!",
        "Get a good chair and a desk at an adjustable height, if possible, so that they don't outgrow it.",
        "Avoid having a computer at the desk.",
        "It's better, especially when your kids are young, to pay attention to what your child does on the internet, so keep their computer in a family area.",
        "Having a computer where they do paper assignments can also be very distracting.",
        "It is a good idea to have a big enough desk to put a computer on when they're older, otherwise it will become precarious and you might have to buy a new one or let them work somewhere else.",
        "Getting Inspiration Do bright, blocked colors.",
        "Choose colors that are classic and bright for a theme that will last your child into their teens and beyond.",
        "Teal, bright green, white, and red make a good color palette that works for any gender child and will still appeal to a teen.",
        "Do a space theme.",
        "A dark blue room with hints of silver throughout is a great basis for a room.",
        "Space is a fun theme for a kid that will still be \"cool\" when they're 16, if you do it right.",
        "Get items like a moon lamp, bedding with stars, icicle lights around the top of the room, and other details that draw the room together.",
        "Do an ocean theme.",
        "And under-the-water look will appeal to lots of kids and it's easy to help it grow up with them.",
        "Use colors like light and dark teal, seafoam, and a few hints of green.",
        "This room works particularly well if you have beige carpets already installed.",
        "A couple of stuffed fish friends and something like a jellyfish lamp can further draw the room together.",
        "Do a travel theme.",
        "Excite your child's sense of adventure by giving them a room that any explorer would love.",
        "Paint the room with the muted colors of maps (off-white, light green, beige, and maybe some hints of red), and decorate with globes, vintage suitcase storage, airplane mobiles, and train maps.",
        "Do a nature theme.",
        "Some greens and browns, with a few hints of blues can create the basis of a room that your child can enjoy for years to come.",
        "This is a great room for a kid that loves stuffed animals, as they'll fit right in!",
        "Get a unique look by creating a wall tree out of paper, and a circular blue rug makes a great \"pond\" at the center of the room.",
        "Do a fairytale theme.",
        "If your little girl longs to be a princess, avoid painting the whole room pink by going with a fairy tale castle theme instead.",
        "Grassy green on the lower part of the walls and sky blue on the upper parts will create the look of rolling hills, some tall gray bookshelves can be painted to look like towers, and a stuffed dragon in the corner can complete the look."
