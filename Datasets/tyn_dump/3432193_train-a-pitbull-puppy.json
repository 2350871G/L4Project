        "During the first few weeks, your puppy will be naturally inclined to follow you everywhere, even without a leash.",
        "Also, since its senses haven't fully developed, the puppy won't notice as many distractions while you're walking.",

        "If they make a mess, communicate clearly and firmly without harsh punishment.",
