Having his ears relaxed against his head is a good sign that he is calm and submissive. You must not continue if you dog is not submissive, otherwise you will increase his excited energy. Once you have the lead, you can put it on him. Make sure that the dog is still submissive."

Dogs can sense the tension, even if we humans do not mean to send it down the lead to them. Try your best to relax your arm, keeping a firm grip on the lead. Only tense the lead if your dog pulls you. You must only pull it for a second or so, enough to draw his attention away. Pull also, to the side, not up as this sends the signals better."

Make sure that he is still beside you, and at your heel, and walk him calmly to your door. He may notice that you just want to get inside, and he will take advantage of that. He may see this as a weakness, so keep your shoulders high and remember that you are in control."

Treats can be a great way to motivate your dog, but you don't want to give it too many treats, or it might gain weight. One way to avoid that is to take a handful of food out of every meal and put it into a training pouch. Then, when you're walking the dog, you can use that food as an incentive."
