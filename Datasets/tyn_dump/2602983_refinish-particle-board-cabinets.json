Once you\u2019ve removed every drawer, grab a Philips or flathead screwdriver. Unscrew each bracket and fastener connecting your doors to the frame of the cabinet. As you remove each piece, label it with pencil so that you know where it goes when it comes time to reinstall the cabinets. Unscrew each handle and knob and set them aside next to their corresponding drawer or door. Set each screw and bracket next to the corresponding piece that it belongs to ensure that you don\u2019t mix the brackets up. You can label each drawer by describing where it goes or you can assign each row a letter and number your drawers and doors. You can also draw a diagram showing where each drawer belongs to make the labeling process easier to understand. Refinishing your cabinets will likely take 4-5 days since you need to wait for each coat of primer and paint to dry."

This will save you quite a bit of effort, but it may cost $25-100 to rent the orbital sander. Do not use an orbital sander on wood veneer panels. You don\u2019t really need to refinish the insides of your cabinets and drawers, but you can if you want! The same applies to the undersides of your cabinet, although many people choose to refinish the undersides of the upper cabinets to make them uniform. However, if the wood underneath your upper cabinets is really thin, you may struggle to sand and paint them without cracking the wood. If you notice that your cabinets have veneer stickers on them to make them look like real wood, do not remove them. Use an 80-grit instead of 120- or 180-grit sandpaper to create a texture in the veneer. Sand them slightly softer than you normally would to avoid cracking or peeling the veneer. Other than using a softer sanding method, you do not need to treat these cabinets differently."

        "Lay a plastic or cloth drop cloth down along the edges of your cabinets to keep your floor clean while you sand, prime, and paint.",
        "Set up 2 saw horses or lay another drop cloth over your table to make painting your cabinets and drawers easier.",
        "If your cabinets sit an angle along multiple walls, use more than 1 drop cloth to cover as much of the floor as possible.",
        "Tape off any surfaces you want to keep dry using painter\u2019s tape.",
        "Use painter\u2019s tape to cover any edges where the wall meets the cabinet.",
        "Pull out each length of tape and smooth it down against your wall with your palm as you apply it.",
        "Use tape to cover any sections of your cabinet or backsplash that you don\u2019t want to paint.Tip: If you have any outlets built into your backsplash or cabinets, remove the faceplates using a screwdriver and put a piece of tape over the outlets.",
        "If you\u2019re worried about getting paint on your countertop, lay an additional drop cloth over the counter to keep it dry.",
        "Wear a respirator, thick gloves, and protective eyewear.",
        "There will be a lot of sawdust and paint fumes floating through the air while you\u2019re working.",
        "To keep your lungs safe, wear a respirator.",
        "Keep sawdust out of your eyes by wearing protective eyewear.",
        "Put on gloves and long-sleeved clothing to keep paint off of your skin.",
        "You don\u2019t need to wear the respirator the entire time, but it has to be on when you\u2019re sanding and priming to avoid irritating your lungs.",
        "You won\u2019t need to wear it while you\u2019re painting if you go with latex paint, but oil-based paints are typically noxious and you\u2019ll want to wear a respirator.",
        "Sanding and Priming the Wood Use wood putty to repair damaged or chipped wood and let it dry.",
        "Get a can of wood putty and a putty knife.",
        "Open the wood putty and scoop some up using the blade of your putty knife.",
        "Rub the putty into your damaged surface to fill it with wood putty.",
        "Once the hole is filled, empty your putty knife and scrape the surface repeatedly to remove the excess putty.",
        "Wait 24 hours for the putty to completely harden.",
        "Repeat this process for every damaged section of your cabinet.",
        "Don\u2019t forget about your doors and drawers!",
        "For each step in this process, repeat the action with your doors and drawers.",
        "Set them up on your sawhorses or stable work surface to sand, prime, and paint them.",
        "Use a 120- to 180-grit sandpaper to sand your cabinets, doors, and drawers.",
        "To remove the current finish or paint, get a sheet of sandpaper.",
        "You can also use a sanding block if you prefer.",
        "Scrape each surface of your cabinets, doors, and drawers using a firm, circular stroke.",
        "Cover each area 4-5 times to expose the wood\u2019s pores and grind away the current finish.",
        "If you aren\u2019t repainting the insides of your cabinet, doors, and drawers, don\u2019t sand them.Variaton: If you want to save yourself some work, get an orbital sander from your local hardware store.",
        "Attach a 120-grit disc to the sander and turn it on its lowest power setting.",
        "Then, use the disc to sand your cabinets.",
        "This will save you quite a bit of effort, but it may cost $25-100 to rent the orbital sander.",
        "Do not use an orbital sander on wood veneer panels.",
        "You don\u2019t really need to refinish the insides of your cabinets and drawers, but you can if you want!",
        "The same applies to the undersides of your cabinet, although many people choose to refinish the undersides of the upper cabinets to make them uniform.",
        "However, if the wood underneath your upper cabinets is really thin, you may struggle to sand and paint them without cracking the wood.",
        "If you notice that your cabinets have veneer stickers on them to make them look like real wood, do not remove them.",
        "Use an 80-grit instead of 120- or 180-grit sandpaper to create a texture in the veneer.",
        "Sand them slightly softer than you normally would to avoid cracking or peeling the veneer.",
        "Other than using a softer sanding method, you do not need to treat these cabinets differently.",
        "Vacuum the cabinets and the floor to remove any sawdust.",
        "Once you\u2019ve sanded the cabinets, there will be a lot of sawdust.",
        "To remove it, run a cloth across each surface to rub most of the dust off.",
        "Then, turn on a vacuum with a hose attachment.",
        "Working your way from the top to the bottom, run the hose across every surface of your cabinets to remove the sawdust.",
        "You don\u2019t have to vacuum the floor if you don\u2019t want, but you may knock up some of the dust into your paint as it\u2019s drying.",
        "It\u2019s best to remove the sawdust everywhere if you can.",
        "You can use a hand vacuum instead of a hose attachment if you prefer, but it may be awkward to use on the interior edges of the cabinet.",
        "Prime your cabinets and wait 24-48 hours for the primer to dry.",
        "Open the windows and turn a fan on to improve the ventilation in the room while you work.",
        "Fill a paint tray halfway with an oil-based primer.",
        "Load your brush and paint the edges of your cabinets and drawers using back-and-forth strokes and painting in the direction of the wood grain.",
        "Brush paint into the recessed details and engravings.",
        "Then, use a foam roller to cover the larger panels and flatter surfaces.",
        "Continue priming your cabinets, doors, and drawers until you\u2019ve covered every surface.",
        "Wait at least 24-48 hours after applying your primer to give it time to dry.",
        "Use the foam roller on any flat sections of your cabinets.",
        "Flat sides, front panels, and narrow beams should all be painted with the roller.",
        "Use the brush to paint any section of your cabinets that you can\u2019t use a roller to cover.",
        "You can use a spray primer if you prefer, but it will be kind of awkward to use indoors and it is difficult to keep it off of the walls and countertop.",
        "Sand the primed surfaces with an 80- to 120-grit sandpaper.",
        "Once your primer has dried, get another sanding brick or sheet of sandpaper.",
        "Repeat the sanding process by using hard, circular strokes to sand your primed surfaces.",
        "Cover each surface 4-5 times to ensure that you expose the porous wood underneath.",
        "Vacuum again after you\u2019ve finished sanding your surfaces.",
        "You need to sand in order to ensure that your paint adheres to the wood instead of the primer.",
        "If you don\u2019t sand, your paint job may look uneven and clunky.",
        "Painting Your Cabinets Fill a paint tray with your acrylic or oil-based paint.",
        "Choose an acrylic or oil-based paint based on the color and texture that you want for your top coat.",
        "Open the top of your paint with a flathead screwdriver and mix it with a mixing stick until the color is smooth and uniform.",
        "Fill a clean paint tray halfway with your paint.",
        "Acrylic paint will result in a smoother finish that doesn\u2019t reflect light, but it tends to be harder to clean than oil-based paint.",
        "Oil-based paint is thicker than acrylic and will result in a shinier finish.",
        "It\u2019s a lot easier to clean than acrylic paint, however, it can feel kind of sticky when you touch it.",
        "Paint the trim, corners, and details with an angle brush.",
        "To start, dip a 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) angle brush into your paint and tap it in the tray to remove the excess paint.",
        "Apply paint to the corners and oddly-shaped edges using smooth, even strokes.",
        "Paint in the direction of the wood grain to ensure that the paint adheres to the pores of the wood.",
        "Continue painting until you\u2019ve covered all of the edges and trim.Tip: Keep an eye on the corners of the frame at the bottom of your cabinets.",
        "They tend to accumulate paint and drip.",
        "Smooth any drips out with an unloaded brush.",
        "You can use a natural or synthetic brush.",
        "Nylon is better for smoother wood while a natural brush is better for rougher surfaces.",
        "Your brush strokes will leave a slight texture behind.",
        "You can use the brush to paint all of your cabinet\u2019s surfaces if you want this texture.",
        "If you don\u2019t want to leave this texture behind, paint over the edges of your brush strokes with the roller.",
        "Use a foam roller to paint your panels and even surfaces.",
        "Once you\u2019ve painted the hard-to-paint edges and corners, fill a foam roller up with your paint.",
        "Then, roll the flatter surfaces, like the panels and sides of the cabinets, using even strokes.",
        "Overlap each roll as you apply it.",
        "Cover each section 2-3 times to ensure that there are no gaps in the paint where it soaks into the pores.",
        "Continue painting until you\u2019ve covered each surface that you\u2019re going to paint.",
        "You can use a thick-napped roller if you prefer, but a foam roller tends to be easier to use with smooth surfaces.",
        "Wait 24-48 hours for your paint to dry.",
        "Once you\u2019ve finished painting, wait for the base coat to dry.",
        "This typically takes 24 hours, but it may take slightly longer if you\u2019re using oil-based paint or didn\u2019t do a great job of sanding.",
        "Keep your windows open and any fans on to ensure that the fumes don\u2019t build up in your room.",
        "Reapply additional coats until you achieve the color that you want.",
        "Once your paint dries, inspect the finish to see if it\u2019s consistent and even.",
        "In most cases, you\u2019ll want to apply additional coats to make the paint uniform and the color rich.",
        "Reapply an additional 2-3 coats, waiting and sanding in between each coat to ensure that the paint adheres to the wood.",
        "If you\u2019re painting your cabinets a bright color, you\u2019ll definitely need multiple coats to achieve the true color of the paint.",
        "If you like a slightly uneven or textured look, feel free to stop painting after applying your base coat.",
        "Seal your cabinets with varnish and wait 24 hours for them to dry.",
        "Once your paint job has dried, get a shellac or wood varnish if you want to waterproof the cabinets.",
        "Fill a clean paint tray with your finish and use a natural brush to apply it to the paint.",
        "Work slowly and carefully and paint in the direction of the wood grain.",
        "Use the brush to cover every surface.",
        "Wait at least 24 hours for the shellac or varnish to dry.",
        "You do not have to seal your cabinets if you don\u2019t want to.",
        "It will help protect them over a longer period of time, though.",
        "Reinstall your cabinets and drawers using your diagram and labels.",
        "Once your cabinets are painted and sealed, remove the painter\u2019s tape.",
        "Peel it off slowly to avoid ripping up any paint if you taped sections of the cabinet off.",
        "Then, slide your drawers back into their designated tracks.",
        "Reattach each door using the corresponding brackets and a screwdriver.",
        "Once you\u2019ve reinstalled the drawers and doors, use a screwdriver to reinstall the doorknobs and handles."
