Leave a small straight piece at the base; wind one of the wires around the other to secure the circle shape. Cut out the nylon stocking. You'll need each piece to be large enough to cover the circular shape you've just formed but not so large that it sags. Once you have a good size cut, use that as a template for the rest of the pieces. Stretch the stocking piece over the wire tightly. Wrap green florist's tape around to hold the stocking piece firmly in place. Repeat four more times. You will need five petals to form one flower. (And obviously, make as many petals as you want flowers in total). Assembling the flowers Use five stamen pieces per flower. Bend the stamen wires in half so that the bead ends form 10 heads when bent up together. Attach the bent stamens to one long piece of thin wire. This piece becomes the stem, so make sure it is long enough. Wrap around the bent stamen pieces and the stem wire with florist's tape to bind in place. This forms the stamen centerpiece and stem. Arrange five petals around the stamen centerpiece. Place the middle two petals opposite each other around the stamen piece. Wrap with florist's wire to bind them to the stamen centerpiece and a little part of the stem. Add the other three outer petals at even spacings around the middle petals. Wrap florist's wire around to bind them to the stamen centerpiece and a little of the stem. Wrap the florist's tape around the top of the stem. Take the tape all the way down to the base of the stem, to completely cover the wire. Make any needed adjustments. The flower is now complete but you may find that you need to twist the petals a little to make them appear more realistic. This is really a case of experimentation, so just play around a little to get the idea. Repeat for as many flowers as you wish to make. Vary the colors for variety, especially if making a bunch of flowers (see next part). Making a bunch of flowers Gather together at least five or more finished flowers to form a bunch.  Tie together with a rubber band or an elastic.  Wrap around with pretty paper. Tie a ribbon bow around the paper. Complete. You now have a bunch of stocking flowers.",
