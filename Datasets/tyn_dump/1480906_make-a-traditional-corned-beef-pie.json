        "Crack 1 egg into a small bowl and pour in the water.",
        "Then, use a fork to whisk the egg until the water is incorporated.",
        "Set the egg wash aside while you assemble the pie.",
        "This will be the egg wash that you brush over the pastry.",
        "It will help your pastry become golden brown as it bakes.",
        "Take the dough out of the fridge and get out a pie plate.",
        "Remove the dough and unwrap it.",
        "Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and get out a 9 in (23 cm) deep-dish pie plate or 6 cups (1.4 L) baking dish.",
        "Divide the dough in 1/2 and roll 1 piece into an \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) thick circle.",
        "Use a pastry cutter or knife to divide the dough into 2 evenly sized pieces.",
        "Set 1 piece aside and use a rolling pin to roll out the other piece until it's \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) thick.Tip: If your dish is rectangular or oblong, roll the dough into a rectangle instead of a circle.",
        "Line the plate or dish with the dough and pour the cooled filling into it.",
        "Carefully lift the dough up and into your pie plate or baking dish.",
        "Press the dough until the bottom and sides are completely lined with pastry.",
        "Then, take the chilled filling from the freezer and spoon it into the pastry-lined plate or dish.",
        "Brush the edges of the pastry with egg wash and roll out the remaining dough.",
        "Dip a pastry brush into the egg wash and brush it along the edges of the dough that's lining your plate or dish.",
        "Then, roll the reserved dough until it's \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) thick.",
        "Remember to make the top layer of dough the same size as your plate or dish.",
        "Lay the top pastry over the filling and pinch the edges to seal them.",
        "Carefully transfer the rolled dough onto the filling so it's totally covered.",
        "Use a sharp knife to trim the edges so there's no more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) of dough extending from the plate or dish.",
        "Then, pinch the edges together to seal both layers of dough.",
        "The egg wash that you brushed over the edges will help the top layer of dough stick to the bottom.",
        "Brush the top of the pie with egg wash and cut 3 to 4 slits in the top.",
        "Dip your pastry brush in the egg wash and brush it over the surface of the pie.",
        "Then, use a sharp paring knife to carefully cut 3 or 4 2 in (5.1 cm) slits on the pastry.",
        "The slits will act as vents that allow steam to escape as the pie bakes.",
        "Bake the pie for 45 to 55 minutes or until the top is golden brown.",
        "Put the pie into the preheated oven and let it cook until the pastry is flaky and browned.",
        "If the edges of the pastry look like they're browning too quickly, cover them loosely with aluminum foil.",
        "Since the filling of the pie is already cooked, you're really baking the pie in order to cook the pastry.",
        "Remove the pie and let it sit for 15 minutes before you serve it.",
        "Once your pie looks flaky, carefully take it out of the oven and set it on a rack to cool a little.",
        "This will help the filling thicken up.",
        "You can serve the corned beef pie hot, warm, or even cold.",
        "Consider serving the pie with mushy peas or green beans.",
        "Refrigerate leftover pie in an airtight container for up to 5 days."
