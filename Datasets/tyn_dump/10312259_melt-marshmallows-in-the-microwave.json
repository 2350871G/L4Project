    "text": " Using a Microwave-Safe Bowl Get a microwave-safe bowl that's large enough for your marshmallows. Marshmallows will expand when heated and melted, so make sure your bowl is 3 to 4 times larger than the amount of marshmallows you want to use. There are symbols that you can find on the underside of the bowl which show that it's safe to use:\nA symbol of a dish with wavy lines above it indicates that the bowl is safe to use in the microwave. A symbol of plain wavy lines also means that the bowl is safe to use. Place your marshmallows into your bowl. Don't fill the bowl with the marshmallows. If you want to melt a lot of marshmallows, fill a few different bowls around a quarter of the way. Microwave the marshmallows for 30 seconds at the high setting. Place your bowl into the microwave and close the door. Set the microwave at the high setting and turn the timer to 30 seconds. Leave the bowl uncovered when you place it in the microwave. This will allow the heat to more effectively penetrate the marshmallows. Remove the bowl from the microwave and stir the marshmallows. Use a tea towel or oven glove to take the bowl out of the microwave as it might be too hot to handle. Stir the semi-melted marshmallows in the bowl with a fork or a spoon. Make sure you scrape off any marshmallows that have become stuck to the side of the bowl. Put the bowl back in the microwave for another 30 seconds. Once you've properly stirred the marshmallows, place the bowl in the microwave again. Make sure that the microwave is on the high setting when you turn it back on. after 30 seconds, stir the marshmallows thoroughly. Microwave in 30-second increments until the marshmallows are fully melted. You might need to repeat the process a few times to get the marshmallows as melted as you want them. Make sure you stir the marshmallows properly each time you take them out of the microwave. Melting Marshmallows for Icing Place your marshmallows and water in a microwave-safe bowl. Pour in 2 tbsp (30 mL) of water for every 16 ounces (450 g) of marshmallows you use. Find out if your bowl is safe to use in a microwave by checking its underside. Check for a label or symbol with wavy lines. These indicate that the bowl is safe to use. Microwave the marshmallows and water for 30 seconds at the high setting. Place your bowl into the microwave and turn the dial to the high setting. Keep an eye on the marshmallows at the timer on the microwave runs down. When the 30 seconds are up, take the bowl out the microwave. You might need to wear oven gloves just in case the bowl is too hot. Stir the mix with a spoon coated in solid vegetable shortening. Dip your spoon into some solid vegetable shortening before you stir the mixture. The shortening will make it much easier for you to stir the marshmallows without the spoon getting stuck. Scrape any marshmallow stuck to the sides of the bowl back into the mix. Repeat the microwave and stirring process until the marshmallows are melted. You might need to microwave the marshmallows at 30-second intervals a few times before they're melted enough to be used as icing. Remember to keep stirring the mixture rigorously before adding the bowl back to the microwave. The mix shouldn't be very liquid when finished. It should be very pliable but it should not be runny. Add any flavorings you'd like to the bowl and stir. If you want to add a bit of extra flavor to your melted marshmallow icing, simply pour in any flavorings. Use vanilla extract or food coloring. Pour a few drops of your chosen flavoring into the bowl and use the spoon coated in vegetable shortening to stir the mixture. Pour 65 grams (2.3 oz) of powdered sugar into the bowl and mix. Powdered sugar will add that sweetened taste to your melted marshmallow icing. Once again, use the spoon coated in vegetable shortening to mix the ingredients in the bowl. You might have to coat another spoon in vegetable shortening as the mix turns to dough. Knead the marshmallow mix on a clean work surface. Coat your hands and the table with the vegetable shortening to make it easier to work with the dough. As you knead, add some powdered sugar to the dough. Keep adding powdered sugar until the dough turns into a stiff ball. Store the ball in plastic wrap overnight at room temperature. Rub some vegetable shortening on the melted marshmallow ball before wrapping it in plastic wrap. The next day, unwrap the ball and use it as icing for your cake. If you don't need it for a few days, place the melted marshmallow ball in the fridge.",
