                    "description": "Breastfed babies benefit from eating foods that are rich in iron and zinc. While white chicken meat is leaner, dark meat is a better choice for your baby because it\u2019s higher in iron and antioxidants. Go for a dark meat cut such as chicken thighs or leg quarters. Since most baby formulas are fortified with iron and other important micronutrients, it\u2019s not as important for formula-fed babies to get the additional iron found in dark meat. Ask your pediatrician whether dark meat or white meat is a better choice for your baby. Chicken thighs are also higher in fat compared to the breasts, which makes them more flavorful and easier to puree. You will need 1-2 thighs to make about \u00bd cup (approximately 65 g) of cooked chicken. A single 6 oz (170 g) bone-in, skin-on thigh will yield about 3 ounces (85 g) of meat, but you\u2019ll need more if you\u2019re using small thighs."

Chicken skin does not puree well. If you leave it on, you may end up with large pieces of skin in your puree, which could cause your baby to choke."

Put the chicken on a cutting board and slice it into strips about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) wide, then cut across the strips widthwise to make cubes. Putting the chicken in your freezer for 15 minutes before you slice it will make it easier to cut. Always take care when using a sharp knife. Keep your fingertips curled under when holding the chicken in place so you don\u2019t accidentally cut them."
