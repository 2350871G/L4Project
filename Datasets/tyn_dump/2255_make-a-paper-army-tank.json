    "text": " Start with a piece of paper that is 12\" by 2.\" You can also simply fold an 8-1/2\" x 11\" sheet of paper in half if you don't want to cut paper to size. Cut off a 1\" rectangle from one of the small ends of the paper, as shown. This smaller rectangle will become the cannon on the front of your tank later, so don't throw it away. Align the paper vertically so that the smaller ends are the top and bottom of your work. You will begin folding at the top end. Fold the top left corner to the right side and make a crease. Unfold the paper and smooth it out. Fold the top right corner to the left side, make a crease and unfold the paper.  Fold the bottom left and right corners just as you did the top. Your creases should create an \"X\" at each end. Fold the top left and right sides of the paper in toward the center of the \"X\" until your fingertips touch. With your other hand, push the top of the paper until it is flat to form a triangle. Create a second folded triangle on the bottom end.  Fold the bottom right corner of the top triangle up so that it touches the top of the triangle.  Fold the bottom left corner of the triangle up until it touches the top of the triangle.  Flip the paper 180 degrees.  Fold the right corner of the triangle to the left so that the right corner touches the left corner of the triangle. Make a crease. Fold the corner up so that it touches the top of the triangle.  Open the flap that you just made and fold it back to the right. Tuck the edge under the flap and crease it well. Fold the left corner over and up and then open the flap. Tuck the edge underneath to make a diamond shape. Roll each end of the paper underneath until the 2 ends meet. Interlock the triangles by inserting the flaps from the top end into the diamond at the bottom end. Push the center down.  Roll the 1\" rectangle that you set aside into a tube. Secure it with tape or glue. Insert the tube under the top flaps of the tank to form a barrel.  Finished! ",
