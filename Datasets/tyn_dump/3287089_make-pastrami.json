        "Since the meat is cooked, you only need to worry about giving it enough time to brown.",
        "Watch carefully to make sure that the pastrami does not begin to burn or smoke.",
        "As fat renders off the meat, there is a mild risk of it catching fire in the broiler, especially if you are using a baking sheet instead of a broiler pan with a rack.",
        "Since the pastrami is broiled for such a short time, though, the risk remains quite small.",
        "Slice thinly.",
        "Use a carving knife and fork set to shave off slices of the cooked pastrami, making each slice about 1/8 inch (3.2 mm) thick.",
        "The slices can be made with a regular carving knife, but if you can borrow a professional grade slicer, the process will take even quicker.",
        "Heat slices and serve as desired.",
        "To warm the slices further, place them in a large skillet set over low heat with a few drops of water.",
        "Cook until the fat turns translucent.",
        "This should only take about 5 minutes.",
        "This can be served as a main dish, but for a more classic way to eat this deli meat, consider making hot pastrami sandwiches with it.",
        "Finished."
