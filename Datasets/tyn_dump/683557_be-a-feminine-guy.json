Use a razor and shaving cream to get rid of your facial hair, and shave regularly to fend off the 5 o\u2019clock shadow. If you want to take it a step further, shave your legs, arms, and chest to get rid of your body hair. Electric razors tend to leave a little stubble behind. Use a standard razor and shaving cream to get a cleaner shave. Get a shower gel to shave in the shower if you want to moisturize your skin after shaving. Women and feminine people are generally expected to have less body and facial hair, but keeping it is perfectly fine!"

Trade in your standard-cut jeans for some slim-fit or skinny jeans. Pack the XXL T-shirts up, and get some flattering tank tops and V-cut shirts that are a little more form-fitting. If you\u2019re on the bigger side, avoid going so tight that your clothing hugs your body. Pick clothing items that make you appear slimmer and have more folds or textures on them.
