Sit down with your relatives and have an \"album party\" where you go through each photo and record who is who and any other information they know. You will learn more about your family than you ever knew before. You'll want to record those family stories as well. Record the entire session using a tape recorder if you have one. I recommend using small post-it notes to record information about each photo. You can then place the note near the photo in the album. DO NOT write on the actual photos to record the information, it will damage them permanently. And be sure that the stickiness of the post-it note will not damage the photos as well. If you don't have post-it notes or don't want to chance damage to the photos, then record the information on index cards or a legal pad, carefully recording the information for each photo from each page. Make sure you record it in such a way that it will make sense to you later after all of your relatives have gone home."

If you are doing this, then be sure to invest in some modern acid-free photo album pages and supplies.  Don't just transfer them into some cheap photo album you picked up at the local drugstore.  Photo album technology has come a long way in recent years, and the physical photos will be better preserved for the future.  Any decent craft store should have acid-free photo albums, pages and protective sleeves, along with modern adhesives that will be acid-free and easier to detach should that be needed later.

        "Most modern image software, like Photoshop, allows you to add \"text layer\" to the file.",
        "This layer is maintained separate from the image itself, so the image is not modified.",
        "But now you can put the information around the image (like in the extra white space you added when you resized the canvas) and you will know the information for the photo.",
        "Store your final images in multiple formats for maximum future compatibility.",
        "Different software or services need certain image formats.",
        "Image formats come and go.",
        "Storing in multiple formats ensures that you have formats you need and formats that will probably be supported in the future.",
        "I recommend the following formats: JPEG, TIFF, and Photoshop.",
        "Scanned images should not be stored in JPEG, but processed images, when completed, should have a version stored in JPEG format.",
        "Most photo processors will only work with JPEG format when you want to print the images, so you will need to have JPEG versions.",
        "Just don't use the JPEG version for further image modification, instead use the TIFF or Photoshop versions.",
        "TIFF and Photoshop (if using Photoshop) versions are stored to maintain the lossless versions of the image and to allow for different formats to be available.",
        "Not all image software can read Photoshop format, but most can read TIFF format.",
        "Having them ensures future compatibility.",
        "Store your raw and final images onto a CD or DVD.",
        "Include a \"README\" text file that explains what it is (the photo album history) and what you did (how you organized the images and files).",
        "Send a copy of the final CD/DVD to the family member that let you borrow the original photo album.",
        "Tell them to include it in the photo album for future generations.",
        "Send copies of the final CD/DVD to any interested family members.",
        "Print your own versions of the photos, include them in your own photo album.",
        "Use the photo information you recorded as labels for the photos in your album.",
        "Make your own copies of the final CD/DVD and store them in a safe location, like a safe deposit box.",
        "If your original copy is destroyed, you have a backup.",
        "Keep your data stored in multiple locations and in multiple formats.",
        "Remember when floppy disks were 8\", then 5 1/4\", then 3 1/2\" and then hard drives came along, then CD's, and now we have DVD's?",
        "What data is stored on changes over time and it can happen quickly.",
        "You don't want your data to be \"lost\" or \"trapped\" in a format that you can no longer read or access.",
        "So, be sure you keep it in a medium that is current and supported.",
        "If you can afford to store it in the \"internet cloud,\" that would be great and it makes it easier to share it with others."
