The best location is a hill with plenty of flat space to get a running start at the top, as well as more flat space to slow down at the bottom. Use measuring tape and help from a friend to determine how long the space is that you\u2019ll be using. This will help you to buy the right length of plastic for the slide. Note that the steeper the hill is, the more material you will need to extend past the hill, where sliders can slow down on a flat surface. Note that you will also need the slide to be positioned somewhere close enough for access to a garden hose."

Opt for a width of about 6 feet for a good amount of sliding area, and plastic thickness of 6 millimeters for the most durability. Look or ask for plastic sheeting at a hardware store. You can use a heavy-duty contractor drop cloth, a long tarp, or other plastic sheeting available. It\u2019s best to buy clear or light-colored plastic, as black will absorb more heat and become very hot in the sun."

Use sandbags or other heavy objects on the corners or sides of your plastic to help hold it in place, especially if it is windy. Remember to position your plastic so that there is a flat portion of the slide at the bottom of the hill you set up on.

Wrap foam pool noodles in the edges of the plastic and secure them with velcro to make the buffers. Lay out pool noodles end to end on both long sides of your plastic, as well as the end if you want a stopper. The number of pool noodles will vary depending on your plastic length, but you can calculate based on a typical pool noodle length of 5 feet and a suggested 1 foot of space in between each noodle. Wrap the edges of the plastic all the way around the pool noodles so that the plastic touches itself again. Place 2 inch pieces of velcro where the plastic overlaps, at the ends and middle of each pool noodle, to keep them wrapped securely. Flip the whole slide over once all the pool noodles are secured in the plastic with velcro. This will create a smooth surface for sliding and prevent the velcro from coming undone."

Push the staples through the plastic and into the ground at intervals along each long side of your slide to hold it in place. Make sure the plastic is pulled very taut before staking. Cover each garden staple with a piece of duct tape to protect them from being stepped on or slid over. Use a bright color for the tape so that it\u2019s highly visible. If you have enough material, fold over a small portion of your plastic once or twice at the top of the slide to double or quadruple it before staking it down. This will reinforce against tears at the beginning of the slide, which will get the most pull when sliders run and jump onto it."

If you used pool noodles, simple roll up the slide over the noodles at either edge, removing the stopper noodle if you have one, and fold it at the breaks in between noodles. At the end of the season, you can take all the noodles out to store the slide more compactly.
