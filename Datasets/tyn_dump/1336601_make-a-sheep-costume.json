Choose a hooded sweatshirt for one version of the costume or a crew neck if you want to have a separate hat or headband. If you think you\u2019ll be too hot in a sweatsuit, you could go with a long sleeve shirt instead. Sweatpants are probably your best option for pants unless you want to choose some tights, leggings, or other simple black or white pants. If you use clothes you already have rather than buying new ones for the costume, remember that you\u2019ll be using glue that is permanent. Once you make the costume, the clothes are ruined for regular wear."

If the costume is for an adult, you\u2019ll want to use some kind of synthetic cotton or polyfill batting because it will attach more quickly, and cover more area, than cotton balls. You can use polyfill for a child\u2019s costume, as well. Cotton balls can be purchased at any big-box store or pharmacy. Batting can be purchased at big-box stores, but you might have to go to a craft store. Cotton balls give a more textured and authentic look, but cotton batting will attach much faster and cover more space. If you are in a hurry, don\u2019t use cotton balls."
