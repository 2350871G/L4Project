At this point, decide if the election should happen in person or if voters will be given mail-in ballots to cast their votes. If you\u2019re part of a formal organization, like a city council, consider creating a nominating committee for the election. Members of this committee can work to find suitable officer candidates. For instance, if the election is February 15, make it clear that the deadline for nominations is on January 31.

        "Give voters at least 5 seconds to verbally support and vote for the nominated candidate by using predetermined phrases like \u201caye\u201d or \u201cnay.\u201d Once everyone has spoken, offer voters a chance to disagree with the nomination.",
        "For instance, you could structure the vote like this: \u201cEveryone in favor of electing Andrew Mitchell as Secretary, please say \u2018aye.\u2019 Anyone who disapproves of this nomination, please say \u2018nay.\u2019\u201d Tally the voiced results on a separate sheet of paper.",

        "For example, you could say something like: \u201cPlease welcome Vera Smith, your new Treasurer for the current fiscal year.\u201d Conduct the voting process again to fill the other officer positions.",
        "Read from the list of nominees for a different officer position, then give members time to vote verbally in support of each candidate.",
