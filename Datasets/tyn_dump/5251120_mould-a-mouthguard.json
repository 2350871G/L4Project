Let it sit over your teeth and feel it against the back of your mouth with your teeth, tongue, or by pressing your fingers along your cheeks. If it doesn\u2019t sit comfortably or presses against the back of your mouth at all, you will need to trim it down. If the mouthguard is soft enough, you may be able to bite down on the guard to give you a guide on where your teeth sit in the mouthguard. You can use this to help trim the mouthguard down. Don\u2019t worry if the mouthguard doesn\u2019t fit perfectly over your teeth. It just needs to fit comfortably in your mouth at this point."

If you bit into the mouthguard and can see the impression of your teeth in it, trim the mouthguard so that it just covers your teeth.
