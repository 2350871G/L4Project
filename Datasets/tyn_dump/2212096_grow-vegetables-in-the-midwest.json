Plants that grow well in any part of the Midwest include carrots, beets, lettuce, peas, and potatoes. If you live in zones 2 or 3, choose hardy vegetables like asparagus, spinach, turnips, or onions. Higher zones, such as zones 5-6, can handle more tender vegetables, like cucumber or pumpkin."

Look for an area that gets at least 6 hours of sunlight per day, since many vegetables require direct sunlight. If you live in the lower zones or if you don\u2019t have a yard, consider container gardening. In a container garden, the plants remain in a large pot instead of being planted in the ground. If you're just starting out, mark off a plot about 10 by 10 feet (3.0 m \u00d7 3.0 m) in size. This will allow you to grow roughly 3-5 different vegetables. As you get more experienced, you can expand your garden."

Buy a soil testing kit at a garden store or take a soil sample to your local extension office. There are several ways to fix problematic soil. Average pH in the Midwest can vary anywhere from 5, which is acidic, to 7.5, which is very alkaline. If the pH is too low, amend the soil with lime. If it is too high, mix sulfur into the soil. If your soil\u2019s nutrient quality is poor, mix manure or compost into the soil. This might also help improve drainage.

        "If you live in the lower zones or if you don\u2019t have a yard, consider container gardening.",
        "In a container garden, the plants remain in a large pot instead of being planted in the ground.",
        "If you're just starting out, mark off a plot about 10 by 10 feet (3.0 m \u00d7 3.0 m) in size.",
        "This will allow you to grow roughly 3-5 different vegetables.",
        "As you get more experienced, you can expand your garden.",
        "Test your soil for nutrients and acidity.",
        "Good soil has a pH between 6 and 7 and drains well.",

        "There are several ways to fix problematic soil.",
        "Average pH in the Midwest can vary anywhere from 5, which is acidic, to 7.5, which is very alkaline.",
        "If the pH is too low, amend the soil with lime.",
        "If it is too high, mix sulfur into the soil.",
        "If your soil\u2019s nutrient quality is poor, mix manure or compost into the soil.",

        "Fill each compartment of a seedling tray with potting mix.",
        "You can get supplies at a garden store, nursery, and some hardware stores.",
        "Choose a potting mix that does not contain soil.",
        "These mixes are labeled as \u201cseedling mixes.\u201d Fill each compartment  up to the top.",
        "Seedling trays contain individual slots for each seedling.",
        "They are a convenient and easy way to start your vegetable seedlings.",
        "Bury 1 seed in each pot or cell of the tray.",
        "Place the seed on top of the soil, and press it down with your finger.",

        "Always remember to bring them in before nightfall.",
        "Move the seedlings outdoors after the last frost for an outdoor garden.",
        "Typically, seedlings should be transplanted 2-6 weeks after the last frost.",
        "Read the seed packet to determine the best time for your specific vegetable.",
        "To plant each seedling, dig a hole that is slightly larger than your seedling\u2019s pot.",
        "Carefully remove the seedling with its roots and place it into the hole.",
        "Spread soil around the seedling with your hands, then place a layer of mulch or chopped straw around the plant.",
        "Transplant the seedling to a larger pot for a container garden.",
        "Select a large pot or container so that your vegetable has room to grow.",

        "The best time to water plants is in the morning.",
        "Sowing Seeds Outdoors Mark off rows for your seedlings.",
        "In your garden, establish each row by putting 2 wooden stakes down, 1 at each end of the row.",
        "Tie a string between these stakes to create a straight line.",
        "Take your spade and dig a trench directly below the string.",
        "Read the seed packet to see how deep the trench needs to be.",
        "Small seeds, like carrots, may only need to be 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) deep while others, like corn, may need to be 2 inches (5.1 cm) deep.",
        "Keep each row roughly 1 foot (0.30 m) apart.",
        "Some vegetables, like cauliflower or broccoli, may need more room than this.",
        "Look up recommendations for row spacing for your vegetables.",
        "Spread seeds in the trench.",
        "Some vegetables, such as beans and okra, need 3-4 seeds per 1 foot (0.30 m).",
        "Others, such as lettuce or beets, may need up to 10 seeds per 1 foot (0.30 m).",
        "When you have finished the row, push soil over on top of the seeds with your hands.",
        "As always check your seed packet to see how many sees you need per 1 foot (0.30 m).",

        "Look for any thin, small, or drooping seedlings that are failing to thrive.",
        "Remove these weak seedlings by cutting them away with shears or scissors.",
        "Thinning out your seedlings will help the stronger and larger seedlings get more nutrients to grow.",
        "Thin the vegetables so that there is enough space between each remaining seedling.",
        "Typically, you should leave around 1 foot (0.30 m) between each plant, but this can vary by vegetable.",
        "Fertilize your seedlings after they start to sprout.",
        "Some vegetables need more fertilizer than others.",

        "This only needs to be done once or twice during the growing season.",
        "Add mulch to your garden to prevent weeds and help drainage.",
        "Spread mulch around the base of your seedlings after they are well-established.",
        "This means the seedling is growing larger and has sprouted many leaves.",
        "Buy mulch at a garden store or nursery.",
        "Alternatively, try using grass clippings, dead leaves, or corncobs.",
        "Caring for an Outdoor Garden Get rid of any pests eating your plants.",
