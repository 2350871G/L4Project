Once you are done with all of the pieces, set them aside. Cut two 2-inch (5.08 centimeters) pieces of regular, 20-gauge beading wire. You will be using these to hold your beaded memory wire strands together. Make a small loop at the top of each piece of beading wire. The loop should be fairly small, but big enough so that the doesn't slip through the end loops on your beaded memory wire coils. String the memory wires onto one of the short beading wires.

Open up a jump ring, then slip a charm into it. Poke one of the ends of the jump ring through the loop at the end of an end cap, then close it. If you'd want a simpler bracelet, you can skip this step. Let the glue dry completely before wearing the bracelet. This may take up to 24 hours.

        "Do not tape over the ends, or you won't be able to feed the fire through it.",
        "Try to use a narrow piece of tape; cut it in half lengthwise if needed.",
        "You will be leaving the tape on the cord.",
        "If it is too wide, it will peak out from under the caps.",
        "Feed the wire through the cord.",
        "Some cords have rubber tubing inside.",
        "If your cord has rubber tubing, simply thread the wire through it.",
        "You may have to use a pair of pliers to pull the wire through the cord at the end.",
        "Trim the wire back from both ends of the coil, so that you have 2\u00be coils.",
        "This will make it easier to slip the end caps on.",
        "To trim the wire, push the cord down a little, the cut the wire using a pair of wire cutters.",
        "Repeat this step for the other end of the coil as well.",
        "Glue an end cap or cord cap onto each end of the cord.",
        "Place a few drops of super glue into the cup part of the cap, then push the cap onto the end of the cord.",
        "You will need to twist the cap in order to get it all the way on.",
        "Repeat for the other end of the bracelet.",
        "The tape should be covered completely by the cap, so you should not have to remove it.",
        "The recommended size is 6mm.",
        "If you are using a different sized cord, however, then make sure that you get caps that match that cord.",
        "For example, if your cord is 4mm, then get 4mm caps.",
        "If you'd like to add charms to your caps, get the kind that have loops on the end.",
        "You can use any color your want, but silver will look best with black leather; brass will look best with brown leather.",
        "Wait 30 minutes for the glue to dry, then add some charms, if desired.",
        "Open up a jump ring, then slip a charm into it.",
        "Poke one of the ends of the jump ring through the loop at the end of an end cap, then close it.",
        "If you'd want a simpler bracelet, you can skip this step.",
        "Let the glue dry completely before wearing the bracelet.",
        "This may take up to 24 hours.",
        "Once the glue has dried, your bracelet is ready to wear."
