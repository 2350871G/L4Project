Turn the machine to a low power setting, then rub the sander in slow, horizontal motions across the surface. Apply a light, even amount of pressure so you can work away any scratches or bumps in the finish. Start on 1 side of the surface, then move the sander slowly to the opposite side.Make sure that the sandpaper is labeled as \u201cwet/dry.\u201d You can find this type of paper at most hardware or home improvement stores, or you can buy it online.Tip: You can also use a scrubbing pad with your orbital sander. Without inserting any sandpaper or buffing pads, rest the blank surface of the sander on top of the scrubbing pad. Once you turn your sander on to a low speed, the pad will spin and buff the finished surface. For a shinier finish, stick a soft buffing pad beneath your sander instead."
