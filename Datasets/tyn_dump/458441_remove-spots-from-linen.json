Whether a stain is from food or ink or anything else, drawing it out from linens will work best when it hasn't yet dried. Some older stains require dry cleaning to be removed. Dry cleaning can ruin linens so it\u2019s imperative that you try and treat stains quickly so that you don\u2019t have to resort to harsher methods to remove the stain."

You want to remove as much of the substance as possible before beginning to treat the stain. Do not squeeze or press the linen or stain.

Lay out your linen and place a few paper towels or rag clothes underneath to catch excess liquid. Sprinkle baking soda on the stain and add a few drops at a time of vinegar. Blot the stain with a paper towel to soak up the moisture. Lemon juice will help whiten any dingy materials. Squeeze some juice onto a stain or discolored linen item and let it sit until you see it begin to lighten, and then rinse it out. You can also buy a stain treatment to apply to the stain like Tide or Oxyclean. Don't even rub a stain. Rubbing and applying too much pressure will help a stain to set into the linen rather than get it out."
