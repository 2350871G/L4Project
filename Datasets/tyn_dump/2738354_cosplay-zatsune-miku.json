Official images and screencaps would be the best, but you can use fan art or photos of cosplayers as well. Zatsune Miku is a variant of Hatsune Miku. Her outfit is very similar in terms of style. The most notable difference is the color scheme: red, gray, and black instead of teal, gray, and black. Have the images handy either on your phone, tablet, or computer. You can also print them out.

                    "description": "You won't be able to find the entire outfit in a single pattern, so you\u2019ll have to mix-and-match pieces from various patterns. For example, you might have to get the skirt from one pattern and the shirt from another. You will most likely have to modify the shirt pattern as well. You may need several patterns for the shirt: a fitted button-up blouse, a jacket with puffed sleeves, and something with a pointed collar. Keep in mind that you don't have to make the entire outfit from scratch. For example, you can buy or modify existing pieces, such as the black, pleated mini skirt."

The collar and puffed sleeves are a separate piece, much like a bolero. Make the sleeves and collar as a single piece. Use gray for the collar and black for the sleeves."

The body and sleeves are black, while the collar is gray to match the skirt. The sleeves and collar are also trimmed in red. Cotton is the easiest to sew with, but if you want a more of a Vocaloid look, try a shiny fabric, such as satin, dupioni silk, or vinyl. When applying the trim, it would be best to sew it on. If you're having trouble doing that, however, you can use an iron-on hem tape instead."

Commissioners need time to make the outfit, while overseas companies need time to ship it. Most cosplay outfits are shipped from China or Japan, so unless you live in one of these countries, you should be prepared to wait at least 1 month for your cosplay to arrive. Another reason you want to give yourself extra time is in the unfortunate event that the cosplay doesn't fit."

Put them on, then paint the top 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of each stocking with red fabric paint. Keep the stockings on until the paint dries. Alternatively, roll a sheet of poster board into a cylinder that's the same size as your thigh, then put it into the stockings. Paint the stockings, then leave the cylinder inside until the paint dries. If the stockings are too long, roll them down (on the inside) until they are the correct length. Ribbon and duct tape are not good ideas because they don't stretch. The paint will stretch a little as you pull the stockings on and off. You may be able to buy the stockings online or in a shop that specializes in Anime accessories."

The hair bands should be between 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) wide and about \u20442 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) thick. Stack and glue 4 popsicle sticks together to make a thicker stick. Do this 4 times total, then glue the sticks to make a square. This makes 1 hair band. Cut a square out of black foam board, then cut a smaller square of it. Do this twice to make a set of hair bands. You can stack multiple squares together to make thicker bands. Stack and glue 4 sheets of black craft foam together. Cut 2 squares out of them, then cut a smaller square out of each one.

You can also use a pair of black headphones, but you will need to add a curved wire with a small piece of black foam attached to it to mimic the mic. Cut more shapes out of craft foam, then glue then on top to create the designs and add dimension.

Keep shaving the sides of the triangle until it reaches the tip of your nose. For a more accurate look, snip upwards into the bottom of the section with scissors.

It is easier to thin the ends of the extensions while they are off the wig. Clip them onto something high above your head, like a curtain or shower rod.

    "text": " Assembling the Outfit Find lots of reference images if you want to make the cosplay yourself. Like Hatsune Miku, Zatsune Miku has several variations of her outfit. Choose one of her outfits or looks, then find lots of clear images of it. Official images and screencaps would be the best, but you can use fan art or photos of cosplayers as well. Zatsune Miku is a variant of Hatsune Miku. Her outfit is very similar in terms of style. The most notable difference is the color scheme: red, gray, and black instead of teal, gray, and black. Have the images handy either on your phone, tablet, or computer. You can also print them out. Find images of Zatsune Miku from different angles, including the front, side, and back. Purchase sewing patterns that are similar to her outfit. You won't be able to find the entire outfit in a single pattern, so you\u2019ll have to mix-and-match pieces from various patterns. For example, you might have to get the skirt from one pattern and the shirt from another. You will most likely have to modify the shirt pattern as well. You may need several patterns for the shirt: a fitted button-up blouse, a jacket with puffed sleeves, and something with a pointed collar. Keep in mind that you don't have to make the entire outfit from scratch. For example, you can buy or modify existing pieces, such as the black, pleated mini skirt. Sew the cosplay according to the pattern, modifying it as needed. Zatsune Miku wears a fitted, button-up blouse with the top part cut off so that it looks like a corset. The collar and puffed sleeves are a separate piece, much like a bolero. Make the sleeves and collar as a single piece. Use gray for the collar and black for the sleeves. Use a black, red, and gray color scheme. Zatsune Miku wears a black, pleated mini skirt with a red trim. Her shirt is gray with red trim. The bolero is a little more tricky. The body and sleeves are black, while the collar is gray to match the skirt. The sleeves and collar are also trimmed in red. Cotton is the easiest to sew with, but if you want a more of a Vocaloid look, try a shiny fabric, such as satin, dupioni silk, or vinyl. When applying the trim, it would be best to sew it on. If you're having trouble doing that, however, you can use an iron-on hem tape instead. Purchase or commission the outfit if you don't want to make it yourself. Regardless of which option you choose, do it several months before the convention. Commissioners need time to make the outfit, while overseas companies need time to ship it. Most cosplay outfits are shipped from China or Japan, so unless you live in one of these countries, you should be prepared to wait at least 1 month for your cosplay to arrive. Another reason you want to give yourself extra time is in the unfortunate event that the cosplay doesn't fit. Adding the Accessories Buy or make a red tie. You can use an actual tie, but you will have to learn how to tie it properly. Alternatively, you can use a faux tie that you clip, Velcro, or snap onto the front of your collar. Make sure that the red on the tie matches the red trim on the rest of the outfit. To avoid a masculine look, get a slender tie rather than the standard, thick, male tie. Paint red trim on a pair of black thigh-high stockings. Purchase a pair of black, opaque stockings that land just below your skirt when you\u2019re wearing them. Put them on, then paint the top 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of each stocking with red fabric paint. Keep the stockings on until the paint dries. Alternatively, roll a sheet of poster board into a cylinder that's the same size as your thigh, then put it into the stockings. Paint the stockings, then leave the cylinder inside until the paint dries. If the stockings are too long, roll them down (on the inside) until they are the correct length. Ribbon and duct tape are not good ideas because they don't stretch. The paint will stretch a little as you pull the stockings on and off. You may be able to buy the stockings online or in a shop that specializes in Anime accessories. Cover the soles of black loafers with red duct tape or red electrical tape. You can also paint the soles with red fabric paint instead. Only cover the sides of the soles, not the bottoms. If you cover the bottoms, the paint or tape will wear away and cause the sides to chip. Look for a pair of loafers with 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.6 cm) heels. The shoes must be black and solid-colored with no patterns or embellishments. If the only shoes you can get have embellishments on them, cover the embellishments with black paint or black electrical tape. Make a pair of square hair bands to slide over your wig's pigtails. There are several ways that you can make this. Make the hair bands first, then paint them black, if needed, with red trim. The hair bands should be between 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) wide and about \u20442 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) thick. Stack and glue 4 popsicle sticks together to make a thicker stick. Do this 4 times total, then glue the sticks to make a square. This makes 1 hair band. Cut a square out of black foam board, then cut a smaller square of it. Do this twice to make a set of hair bands. You can stack multiple squares together to make thicker bands. Stack and glue 4 sheets of black craft foam together. Cut 2 squares out of them, then cut a smaller square out of each one. This will give you a set of hair bands. Modify a headset with craft foam to look like Zatsune Miku's. Cut a square with a rounded top out of craft foam to mimic the shape of Zatsune Miku's headset. Hot glue a 1 to 1 \u20442 in (2.5 to 3.8 cm) wide strip of matching foam around the circumference to give it depth. Glue this over 1 of the earphones, then repeat the process for the second one. You can also use a pair of black headphones, but you will need to add a curved wire with a small piece of black foam attached to it to mimic the mic. Cut more shapes out of craft foam, then glue then on top to create the designs and add dimension. The colors and design of the headset will vary depending on which version of Zatsune Miku you're doing. Some use more red while others use more black. Styling the Wig Get a short, black wig with bangs and a pair of \u201ctwin tail extensions\u201d. You can find both in an online wig store that specializes in Anime style wigs. Look for a bob-style wig with bangs long enough to reach the tip of your nose. The extensions should be the clip-on kind and be about 120 centimetres (47 in) long. You get what you pay for when it comes to wigs, so avoid the cheap kind from the costume store; they will be difficult to work with. You can buy or commission a Zatsune Miku wig online, but be prepared to modify it. Not all of them screen-accurate. If you have short, black hair that is already the correct length and style, just buy the extensions, then Click here to continue. French braid your hair, put on a wig cap, then put the wig on. Put your hair into 2 French braids, then pin the braids against your scalp. Cover your hair with a wig cap, then secure it with bobby pins. Put the wig on and secure it with bobby pins as well. Don\u2019t use a wig head for this. Wig heads are typically smaller than human heads, and the placement of the eyes won\u2019t match your own. Comb the bangs down over your eyes and tuck the rest behind your ears. Section off the hair that's in front of your ears, then tuck the rest behind your eyes so that it stays out of the way. Use a comb to brush the wig's bangs over your eyes. Wigs have sideburn stubs, which you can use as a placement stub. Pull everything behind these stubs behind your ears. Separate the bangs into 3 sections, then clip the side sections back. Make the middle section about the width of the space between your eyebrows. Twist the left side section, then pull it back and clip it to the wig. Do the same with the right section. Don\u2019t tuck the left and right sections behind your eyes, or they will get mixed in with the rest of the bangs. You may have some hair from the wig\u2019s sideburns left over. Leave this alone for now. Apply hair wax to the middle part, comb it, then trim it into a point. Pinch the bottom of the middle section between your middle and index fingers. Use a pair of scissors or a razor blade to shave down the left and right sides until the section comes into a triangular point. If you\u2019re using scissors, point them downward and make small snips as you work your way down the sides of the hair section. Keep shaving the sides of the triangle until it reaches the tip of your nose. For a more accurate look, snip upwards into the bottom of the section with scissors. This will help thin the section out and give it that wispy, Anime look. Clip the middle part out of the way, then thin the left and right parts. Apply hair wax to the left section, then comb it through. Grab a pencil-thin strand at random, pinch the end between your fingertips, and shave down the side edge with your scissors or a razor blade. Do this a few more times until the left section is thinned to your liking, then repeat the process for the right. Use the same technique that you did when shaping the middle section; you only need to shade down one side of the strand, however. Thin the under layer of the side bangs with thinning shears. Using the wefts as a guide, twist and clip the upper portion of the left and right side bangs out of the way. Cut the left side bang about halfway down with a pair of thinning shears, then comb it through with a comb. Do the same for the right side bang. You may have to do this a few times in order to achieve the level of wispiness you need. Check your reference photos and be sure to comb them after each cut. Thin the sideburns with scissors and thinning shears. Clip the rest of the bangs out of the way first. Use your scissors to slice and trim the hair in front of your ears into points. Thin the hair out further by holding the scissors vertically and cutting up into the ends. Thin the hair out further by chopping into it with thinning shears. Apply hair wax to the hair and remember to comb it out often. Unclip all sections, then shape them into points with hair wax. Remove all of the clips holding the bangs out of the way first. Next, get out your reference photos and look at how Zatsune Miku\u2019s bangs fall. Apply hair wax to the tips of the bangs, then use your fingers to pinch them into points. Work in both small and large sections, based on your reference photos. Tie 2 mini pigtails to the top of your wig, one on each side. Gather a thumb-thick section of hair from the top-left section of your wig, and wrap a black hair tie around it. Do the same thing for the top-left side of the wig. Look at your wig in the mirror from different angles to ensure that the pigtails match. Don\u2019t pull all of the wig hair into the pigtails. You just need a set of stubs in order to anchor the twin tail extensions. Use regular hair ties rather than mini or clear hair ties. This will create extra bulk for the extensions to grab on to. Brush the extensions out, then clip them onto the pigtails. Twin tail extensions come with clear claw clips in them. Pinch the claw clip open, side it over the pigtail, then release it. Gently shake your head from side to side to ensure that the extensions hold. If the extensions feel loose or slide off, this means that the mini pigtails aren\u2019t thick enough. Take the extensions off, undo the pigtails, and try again; make the pigtails thicker this time. Cut the extensions shorter, if needed. The extensions should fall to about your mid-calf. If they are much longer than that, consider cutting them shorter. Cut them down to the right length with regular scissors first. Next, hold your scissors vertically and snip into the ends of the extensions. It is easier to thin the ends of the extensions while they are off the wig. Clip them onto something high above your head, like a curtain or shower rod. While ankle length extensions might be more accurate, they will be cumbersome. If you cut them a little shorter, they will still look accurate, but they will be more comfortable to wear. Doing the Makeup Wash your face, then apply toner, moisturizer, and primer. Clean your face using a face wash that is suitable for your skin type. Pat it dry with a clean towel, then apply some toner. Follow up with moisturizer. Finally, apply some face primer, focusing on the T-zone. You should still use moisturizer even if you have oily skin. Just use a product labeled for oily skin, and you\u2019ll be fine. Your T-zone includes your forehead, nose, cheekbones, and chin. These are the areas that are prone to open pores. It would be a good idea to prep your lips with a coat of lip balm as well. Apply some concealer, if needed, then foundation and powder. Apply the concealer first, focusing on any blemishes and dark or red patches. Blend it in well, then apply a foundation that matches your skin tone. Be sure to set your foundation with powder. How you apply the foundation is up to you. Some people like to use a makeup sponge while others prefer a brush. Be sure to blend it in well, however! Use colored concealer to cover up problem areas. For example, green concealer is great for toning down redness, while orange concealer is good for under eye shadows. Contour your face with highlighter and shadow. You can use a highlighting kit for this, or create your own using foundation or eyeshadow. If you chose to create your own, match the color to your skin tone, but go a few shades lighter for the highlight and a few shades darker for the shader. Highlight the following areas: your jawbone, nose bridge, cheekbones, and forehead. You can also highlight your cupid\u2019s bow. Shade the following areas: hollows of your cheeks, temples, the sides of your nose, and under your jaw line. Shape and shade your eyebrows with concealer and dark eyeshadow. How exactly you go about doing this depends on what you are starting with. You may need to pluck your eyebrows a little or cover them up with concealer and powder. Look at your reference photos of Zatsune Miku, and try to make your eyebrows resemble hers. Use a dark eyeshadow or brow powder, such as black or charcoal. Use an angled brush and black eyeshadow or Khloe to fill in and darken your eyebrows. Use concealer to hide parts of your eyebrows and refine the shape. Set the look with powder or makeup setting spray. Do your eyeshadow using shades of red and brown. Apply light brown eyeshadow all over your lid and dark brown eyeshadow in the crease and the outer corners of your eyes. Touch the lower lash line with some dark brown eyeshadow as well. Finish off with red eyeshadow, starting from the crease and fading it up towards your brow bone. Give your look more dimension by tapping the inner corners of your eyes with white or ivory eyeshadow. Brush a small amount onto your brow bones too. Zatsune Miku doesn\u2019t really wear eyeshadow, but many cosplayers choose to apply some regardless. Since her color scheme uses lots of red, red eyeshadow is the popular go-to color. If you can\u2019t find red eyeshadow, consider going for a dark, smoky eye look instead. Apply black eyeliner to your upper and lower lashes. For a darker, gothier look, use an eyeliner pencil (not liquid liner) on your lower lashes, then smudge it with a Q-tip or a sponge-tipped makeup brush. If you want, you can use liquid liner on your upper lashes, and finish off with a cat eye or wing tip. Make your eyes appear larger by applying white eyeliner to your waterline. Finish your eyes off with 1 to 2 coats of mascara. A volumizing, lengthening mascara would be a great choice here. You can also add more definition to your lashes by curling them and/or applying false lashes as well. This is entirely up to you. If you choose to use false lashes, apply those first, then curl them. Apply the mascara last to help seal everything together. For extra length and volume, use up to 3 or 5 coats of mascara. Apply red lipstick over your lips. For a more natural effect, go for an ombre look instead. Apply the lipstick to the middle and inside of your lips, then use a clean brush to fade it towards the corners and your lip line. Zatsune Miku already has a gothy look, so you can get away with apply black or dark red lipstick instead. You\u2019re transitioning an animated character into real life, so you have some freedom here. Set your look with setting spray or powder. This is very important and key to making your makeup last all day. Powder is a great choice for reducing shine; if you prefer to use setting spray, then choose something that\u2019s labeled for reducing shine. When applying powder, try the \u201cbaking technique.\u201d Load a good-quality setting powder (i.e. : MAC or Ben Nye) onto your face. Let it sit for about 10 to 15 minutes, then dust it off with a powder brush. Get a pair of red contact lenses if you want a more accurate look. This is completely optional, and you don't have to wear contacts if you don't feel comfortable with them. If you are feeling bold enough, however, give a pair of red, circle Anime lenses a try. If don't already have a prescription, visit an optometrist to get one. Make sure that you have the process of taking the contacts in and out down. Never leave contacts in for longer than the recommended time\u2014typically a few hours to a full day. Do not go to sleep while wearing the lenses.",
