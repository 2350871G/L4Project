The length of your trip line needs to be at least equal to this depth. You never know when you'll get tall waves because of rough conditions. Account for this by adding about 3 ft (.91 m) to your minimum length for the line. Avoid allowing too much extra line in the water, as this can make it more likely to foul. Extra slack can be wrapped around the buoy's bottom. If you plan on being buoyed at this location for a long period of time, make sure your trip line is a little longer than the highest tide (of all the high tides) during your anchorage."

If the hole on your anchor for your trip line is rough, you'll need a shackle so the line doesn't chafe and break.
