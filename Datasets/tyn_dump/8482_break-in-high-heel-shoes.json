The more often you wear your heels, the more of an opportunity your heels have to stretch and conform to your feet. To avoid the awkwardness and potential danger of wearing new high heel shoes while out and about, start by wearing your shoes at home. You can wear them while watching television or folding laundry. You can wear them while cooking dinner. You can also take your heels with you to work. If have an office job, wear your shoes at your desk for a couple of hours. Once you feel comfortable wearing and walking short distances in your heels, take them out. Wear them on a short trip to the grocery store or to your local bank."

You can wear them while you're hanging out at home, or while you're sitting at your desk at work. In order for your socks to stretch your shoes properly, they can't be too thin (they won't work) and they can't be too thick (they'll stretch your shoes too much and cause your feet to slip out when you are wearing your heels skin-to-shoe). A regular, everyday sock will do just fine. Do this for a few days and you'll notice that you are blister-free and your shoes are broken in, having molded to the shape of your foot."

Be sure to tuck the bag in places where the shoes feel too tight on your feet. Put the shoes into the freezer, and keep them there until the water freezes completely.
