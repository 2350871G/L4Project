Use your washcloth to wipe around your baby\u2019s leg creases, genital area, and bottom. Make sure you don\u2019t leave any dried on fecal matter, which can sometimes get trapped.

For an uncircumcised boy, don\u2019t push his foreskin back to clean his penis. Gently clean around the area without moving the foreskin. For a circumcised boy, don\u2019t clean the penis for 3 to 4 days after the circumcision. After that, squeeze a thin stream of warm water directly onto your baby\u2019s penis to clean it. Don\u2019t apply any soap unless your doctor tells you to do so. Drying and Dressing Your Baby Pat your baby dry with your extra towel. Gently blot away any excess water on your baby\u2019s skin using a soft, dry towel. If you have a hooded towel, wrap the baby inside it to keep their body warm as your dry them. Don\u2019t rub your baby\u2019s skin, which can irritate it. Apply a pea-size dot of unscented baby moisturizer if their skin feels dry. Most babies don\u2019t need moisturizer. However, you can apply a tiny amount of moisturizer to your baby if their skin feels dry. Rub the lotion onto your baby\u2019s skin to help it absorb, then wrap your baby in a towel or blanket for a few minutes while the lotion absorbs. If your baby\u2019s skin is dry often, you may be bathing them too often. Check with your doctor to make sure you don\u2019t need to change your routine. Put a clean diaper on your baby. After your baby is totally dry, put on a new diaper. Make sure the diaper doesn\u2019t go up over the umbilical cord stump, if they have one. If your son has been circumcised, you may need to put petroleum jelly in the diaper to keep the padding from sticking to your baby. Talk to your doctor to find out if you need to do this. Dress your baby in clean clothes. Put fresh, clean clothes on your baby, then swaddle them in a blanket. Spend a few minutes cuddling your baby so that they experience baths as a calm, comforting experience. Using Best Practices for Health and Safety Bathe your baby 3 times a week to keep them clean. Your baby doesn\u2019t need to be bathed often until they start crawling around. In fact, washing them too often can irritate their skin. Stick to just 3 baths a week. If your baby gets very dirty after being sick or having a diaper blowout, it\u2019s okay to give them an extra bath. However, you might consider adjusting your baby\u2019s bathing schedule if their next bath is coming up soon. Choose a bathing time when you\u2019re feeling unrushed and uninterrupted. Your baby will enjoy bath time more if you are calm and in a good mood. Pick a time of day that\u2019s convenient for you so that you can go slow and give your baby the best experience possible.

Wait at least 30 minutes after a feeding before bathing your baby. Your baby\u2019s tummy needs time to settle after a feeding, so don\u2019t bathe them right after. Instead, wait about half an hour. It\u2019s helpful to create a routine so that you\u2019re feeding your baby at a different time from their bath. Stay with your baby at all times during their bath. Although your baby won't be in the water, they still need to be watched and guarded. Your baby could roll off the flat surface or get tangled up in the towel or blanket. Make sure you\u2019re right next to your baby the entire time, and keep your hand on them as much as possible. Try not to worry during the bath. As long as you are there, your baby will be safe. Speak to your baby in a soothing voice throughout the bath. It\u2019s normal for babies to be afraid and uncomfortable when they first start getting baths. Sponge baths are usually more comfortable for them, but it\u2019s still a new experience. Give them calm encouragement and let them know that everything is okay. This will help your baby have a nice time. Use a soft, upbeat voice, and smile a lot as you talk.",
