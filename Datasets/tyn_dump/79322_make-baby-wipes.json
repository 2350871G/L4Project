Stir in 4 drops of lavender essential oil and 2 drops of tea tree oil. You can use plain water as long as you boil it for 2 minutes first. Let it cool before using it. If you don't have any olive oil, you can try another food-grade oil, such as melted coconut oil or sweet almond oil. You can also try baby oil. If you don't have baby shampoo on hand, try another mild liquid soap, such as castile soap or baby soap. The lavender essential oil will help make the solution soothing while the tea tree essential oil will make it antibacterial. Use aloe vera, witch hazel, and essential oil to make a soothing solution. Pour 1\u00bd cups (350mL) of distilled or filtered water into a bowl. Stir in the following: 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of liquid soap, 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of aloe vera gel, 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of witch hazel, 1/2 tablespoon (7.5 mL) of food-grade oil, and 10 to 15 drops of lavender or tea tree essential oil.
