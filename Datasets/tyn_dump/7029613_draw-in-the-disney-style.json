The eye shape is more like rounded-square, with a big side and a small side, and the big side always in front, for the eyebrows. The brows are perfect, tidy, full of hair and longer than the eye shape area. Add thick, tidy eyelashes, too."

The more the mouth is stretching, the more the lip gets longer and thinner. Lips in Disney animations don't necessarily have one style, so feel free to pick your own."
