This can lead to spilled food and water. If you can't find a bowl the right size, find a plastic lid that can sit on top of the trashcan, then cut a hole in it for the bowl to fit through.

    "text": " Making a Simple Raised Bowl Measure your dog from paw to shoulder, then subtract 4 to 6 inches (10.16 to 15.24 centimeters). Place a measuring tape at the base of your dog's paw, then measure up to his or her shoulder. Next, subtract 4 to 6 inches (10.16 to 15.24 centimeters). This will be the height you need for your base. Get a small, simple trashcan to use as a base. A metal trashcan would be best, but you can use a plastic one too. Try to get one that has straight walls; avoid ones that have grooves or beveled walls. If you have a very big dog, such as a Great Dane, consider getting a 6-gallon (227-liter) paint bucket instead. If the bucket has a handle, be sure to take it off. Get a rimmed dog bowl that is the same diameter as the trashcan. You want the bowl to be small enough so that it will fit inside the trashcan's opening. At the same time, you want it to be big enough so that its rim will sit comfortably on the trashcan's rim. If the bowl is too big, it will roll around on top of the trashcan instead. This can lead to spilled food and water. If you can't find a bowl the right size, find a plastic lid that can sit on top of the trashcan, then cut a hole in it for the bowl to fit through. The bowl must have a rim; it is what will hold it up. Measure the height and circumference of your trashcan, then add a few inches to each measurement. The extra length will allow you to make a nice, finished seam. The extra height will cover you if the fabric starts to go on crooked. Remember, it is always easier to cut off excess fabric than to add more on. If your trashcan has tapering sides, you might want to add several more inches to accommodate the slopes. Cut a sheet of fabric according to that measurement. Choose a fabric that suits the decor of your home. It can be solid-colored or patterned. Cotton would work best for this, but canvas or linen would also look nice. If your bowl is made out of metal, consider a solid-beige color. This will work great with the rope you'll be adding later. For a sea-side theme, choose a solid-blue color. This will work great with white rope. Paint a stripe of Mod Podge down the side of your trashcan, then press the edge of your fabric into it. If your trashcan has a seam, place the edge of the fabric against that seam. Use your fingers to smooth out any wrinkles. Try to leave an equal amount of fabric to the top and bottom of your trashcan. Use a wide paintbrush or foam brush for this. You will be working in small sections at a time, but a tiny paintbrush will take too long. If you can't find any Mod Podge, you can use another type of decoupage glue. You can also use watered-down white school glue (3 parts glue to 1 part water). Continue gluing the fabric to the trashcan, working only a few inches at a time. Once when you are back to where you started, you will find that you have a few inches of extra fabric leftover. Do not glue this fabric down yet. Fold the edge of the fabric under itself, then glue it down. Folding the fabric under by \u00bd inch (1.72 centimeters) would be ideal. If you don't have enough fabric for that, don't worry; just fold the edge under as much as you can. Paint on a thin stripe of Mod Podge, then press the seam down onto it. Wait for the glue to dry before trimming the excess fabric off of the top and bottom edges. The fabric will be much easier to cut once it is dry; you also won't have to worry about ruining your scissors. If the trashcan has a rim, you can run a craft blade right along it; this will cut off the excess fabric neatly. If the glue is taking too long to dry, set it out in the sun. Paint a design onto the front of the can using acrylic paint and a stencil. The design can be as simple as a dog bone, a word (ie: FOOD or WATER), or your dog's name. You can also make it more ornate by painting on a small background first, such as an oval with scalloped edges, letting it dry, and then writing your dog's name on top. This is not completely necessary, but it can make your raised dog bowl look nicer. Wait for the paint to dry, then give the entire can on final coat of Mod Podge. This will help seal your design, and protect the fabric. Make sure that the finish you are using is waterproof or weather-resistant. This way, if the can gets dirty, you can just wipe it clean. Alternatively, you can also coat your entire bucket with clear, acrylic spray sealer. Choose some thick rope for the trim. You will need enough rope to wrap around the top and bottom of your trashcan. Something that is the same thickness as your finger would work well, but keep proportions in mind. The larger the trashcan, the thicker your rope should be; the smaller the trashcan, the thinner your rope will be. If you went with a metal bowl and beige-colored fabric, thick, hemp rope will work great. If you went with a sea-side theme, hemp rope or white cord would look wonderful. If your fabric has a pattern on it, consider using white cord. You can also paint some rope black (or another matching color) with spray paint. Hot glue some rope along the top and bottom edges of the can. Glue the rope down just above the bottom edge, so that the trashcan can still stand firmly on the ground. Glue the other rope just under the rim, so that it does not get in the bowl's way. Because hot glue sets quickly, only squeeze out a few inches of glue at a time. Place the bowl on top, and fill it with food or water. If the trashcan is not very stable, fill it with some heavy rocks first. Alternatively, you can fill the trashcan or bucket with your dog's food, be it canned or kibble. Making a Wooden Raised Bowl Choose your base according to your dog's measurements. Choose a material that is easy to cut with a jigsaw, such as wood or plastic. Avoid metal. Here are some ideas for bases to get you started:\nIf you have a small dog, you could use a short, wooden bench or stool. If you have a medium-sized dog, a wooden create would work great.

If you are using a wooden crate, you may not need to drill a hole. As long as your jigsaw blade can fit between the slates, you should be fine. Use a jigsaw to cut the circle out. Slide the jigsaw blade into the hole, then turn the jigsaw on. Carefully cut around the line that you drew until the circle falls out. Save the cut-out disk for another project, or discard it. Sand any jaggedness away, if desired. You will be placing your dog's bowl into this hole, so most of the jaggedness will be covered up. If the jaggedness really bothers you, however, or if it gets in the way of the bowl, you can sand it away. Start with a coarser grit, and finish off with a finer one.

        "Get a small, simple trashcan to use as a base.",
        "A metal trashcan would be best, but you can use a plastic one too.",
        "Try to get one that has straight walls; avoid ones that have grooves or beveled walls.",
        "If you have a very big dog, such as a Great Dane, consider getting a 6-gallon (227-liter) paint bucket instead.",
        "If the bucket has a handle, be sure to take it off.",
        "Get a rimmed dog bowl that is the same diameter as the trashcan.",
        "You want the bowl to be small enough so that it will fit inside the trashcan's opening.",
        "At the same time, you want it to be big enough so that its rim will sit comfortably on the trashcan's rim.",
        "If the bowl is too big, it will roll around on top of the trashcan instead.",
        "This can lead to spilled food and water.",
        "If you can't find a bowl the right size, find a plastic lid that can sit on top of the trashcan, then cut a hole in it for the bowl to fit through.",
        "The bowl must have a rim; it is what will hold it up.",
        "Measure the height and circumference of your trashcan, then add a few inches to each measurement.",
        "The extra length will allow you to make a nice, finished seam.",
        "The extra height will cover you if the fabric starts to go on crooked.",
        "Remember, it is always easier to cut off excess fabric than to add more on.",
        "If your trashcan has tapering sides, you might want to add several more inches to accommodate the slopes.",
        "Cut a sheet of fabric according to that measurement.",
        "Choose a fabric that suits the decor of your home.",
        "It can be solid-colored or patterned.",
        "Cotton would work best for this, but canvas or linen would also look nice.",
        "If your bowl is made out of metal, consider a solid-beige color.",
        "This will work great with the rope you'll be adding later.",
        "For a sea-side theme, choose a solid-blue color.",
        "This will work great with white rope.",
        "Paint a stripe of Mod Podge down the side of your trashcan, then press the edge of your fabric into it.",
        "If your trashcan has a seam, place the edge of the fabric against that seam.",
        "Use your fingers to smooth out any wrinkles.",
        "Try to leave an equal amount of fabric to the top and bottom of your trashcan.",
        "Use a wide paintbrush or foam brush for this.",
        "You will be working in small sections at a time, but a tiny paintbrush will take too long.",
        "If you can't find any Mod Podge, you can use another type of decoupage glue.",
        "You can also use watered-down white school glue (3 parts glue to 1 part water).",
        "Continue gluing the fabric to the trashcan, working only a few inches at a time.",
        "Once when you are back to where you started, you will find that you have a few inches of extra fabric leftover.",
        "Do not glue this fabric down yet.",
        "Fold the edge of the fabric under itself, then glue it down.",
        "Folding the fabric under by \u00bd inch (1.72 centimeters) would be ideal.",
        "If you don't have enough fabric for that, don't worry; just fold the edge under as much as you can.",
        "Paint on a thin stripe of Mod Podge, then press the seam down onto it.",
        "Wait for the glue to dry before trimming the excess fabric off of the top and bottom edges.",
        "The fabric will be much easier to cut once it is dry; you also won't have to worry about ruining your scissors.",
        "If the trashcan has a rim, you can run a craft blade right along it; this will cut off the excess fabric neatly.",
        "If the glue is taking too long to dry, set it out in the sun.",
        "Paint a design onto the front of the can using acrylic paint and a stencil.",
        "The design can be as simple as a dog bone, a word (ie: FOOD or WATER), or your dog's name.",
        "You can also make it more ornate by painting on a small background first, such as an oval with scalloped edges, letting it dry, and then writing your dog's name on top.",
        "This is not completely necessary, but it can make your raised dog bowl look nicer.",
        "Wait for the paint to dry, then give the entire can on final coat of Mod Podge.",
        "This will help seal your design, and protect the fabric.",
        "Make sure that the finish you are using is waterproof or weather-resistant.",
        "This way, if the can gets dirty, you can just wipe it clean.",
        "Alternatively, you can also coat your entire bucket with clear, acrylic spray sealer.",
        "Choose some thick rope for the trim.",
        "You will need enough rope to wrap around the top and bottom of your trashcan.",
        "Something that is the same thickness as your finger would work well, but keep proportions in mind.",
        "The larger the trashcan, the thicker your rope should be; the smaller the trashcan, the thinner your rope will be.",
        "If you went with a metal bowl and beige-colored fabric, thick, hemp rope will work great.",
        "If you went with a sea-side theme, hemp rope or white cord would look wonderful.",
        "If your fabric has a pattern on it, consider using white cord.",
        "You can also paint some rope black (or another matching color) with spray paint.",
        "Hot glue some rope along the top and bottom edges of the can.",
        "Glue the rope down just above the bottom edge, so that the trashcan can still stand firmly on the ground.",
        "Glue the other rope just under the rim, so that it does not get in the bowl's way.",
        "Because hot glue sets quickly, only squeeze out a few inches of glue at a time.",
        "Place the bowl on top, and fill it with food or water.",
        "If the trashcan is not very stable, fill it with some heavy rocks first.",
        "Alternatively, you can fill the trashcan or bucket with your dog's food, be it canned or kibble.",
        "Making a Wooden Raised Bowl Choose your base according to your dog's measurements.",
        "Choose a material that is easy to cut with a jigsaw, such as wood or plastic.",
        "Avoid metal.",
        "Here are some ideas for bases to get you started:\nIf you have a small dog, you could use a short, wooden bench or stool.",
        "If you have a medium-sized dog, a wooden create would work great.",
        "If you have a big dog, consider using a larger wooden crate, or even a storage unit with doors and drawers.",
        "Choose a rimmed bowl.",
        "The bowl must have a rim, as this is what will help hold it up.",
        "The bigger the rim is, the more stable the bowl will be.",
        "If you are using a wide base, you might even be able to fit one or two more bowls.",
        "Measure the inside diameter of the bowl, then draw a circle using a compass according to that measurement.",
        "If you don't have a compass, you can simply flip the bowl upside down onto your base, trace around the edge with a pencil, then draw a slightly smaller circle inside of it; be sure to erase the outer circle when you are done.",
        "If you plan on adding more than one bowl to your base, remember to leave room for the rims.",
        "Drill a small hole inside the circle that you drew, as close to the edge as you can.",
        "Make sure that the hole is big enough for the tip of your jigsaw to go through.",
        "Also, make sure that the hole goes all the way through your base.",
        "If you are using a wooden crate, you may not need to drill a hole.",
        "As long as your jigsaw blade can fit between the slates, you should be fine.",
        "Use a jigsaw to cut the circle out.",
        "Slide the jigsaw blade into the hole, then turn the jigsaw on.",
        "Carefully cut around the line that you drew until the circle falls out.",
        "Save the cut-out disk for another project, or discard it.",
        "Sand any jaggedness away, if desired.",
        "You will be placing your dog's bowl into this hole, so most of the jaggedness will be covered up.",
        "If the jaggedness really bothers you, however, or if it gets in the way of the bowl, you can sand it away.",
        "Start with a coarser grit, and finish off with a finer one.",
        "Vacuum up any dust, then wipe everything down with a damp cloth.",
        "This is especially important if you plan on painting or sealing your base.",
        "If you do not wish to paint your base, you are done at this point.",
        "If you can either seal the base with a wood stain and sealer, or you can simply place your dog's bowl into the hole and fill it with food.",
        "Paint the base with a coat of primer, then wait for the primer to dry.",
        "This will help smooth out the texture, and help the paint stick to it better.",
        "You can use the brush-on kind or the spray-on kind.",
        "If you are using spray-on primer, make sure that you work in a well-ventilated area, preferably outside.",
        "If you are using a storage unit, you will need to remove any hardware.",
        "This includes things like hinges and knobs.",
        "Paint the base, then wait for the paint to dry.",
        "You can use brush-on acrylic paint, or you can use spray paint.",
        "Once again, if you plan on using spray paint, be sure to work in a well-ventilated area so that you don't get a headache.",
        "You may need two coats of paint; if you decide to do this, let the first coat dry for 15 to 20 minutes.",
        "How long the paint takes to dry will depend on the type of paint you are using.",
        "Most acrylic paints take about 20 minutes to dry.",
        "Some paints also have a curing time, so be sure to read the label on your paint can carefully.",
        "Consider adding some design.",
        "There are lots of ways you can spice up your dog's raised bowl, from decoupaging paper onto it to painting designs.",
        "Adding a design is not completely necessary, but it can make your dog's raised bowl look much nicer.",
        "Here are some ideas to get you started:\nPaint on some designs using acrylic paint and stencils.",
        "Stamp on designs using acrylic paint and painting stamps.",
        "You can also use a round pouncer for a polka-dot design.",
        "Use stencils, acrylic paint, and a foam brush to paint on words, shapes, or designs onto the box.",
        "Use Mod Podge to glue on some patterned paper to the top of your box.",
        "Cut the hole out again, then add another layer of Mod Podge over it when you are done.",
        "Coat the base with a sealer, then let it dry.",
        "You can use the brush-on kind, but the spray-on kind will give you a much smoother finish.",
        "Choose a waterproof, acrylic sealer for extra durability.",
        "Once you have the sealer on, wait for it to dry completely; this could take a few hours.",
        "If you removed any hardware from your base, wait until the sealer has dried and/or cured before putting it back on.",
        "Some sealers also have a curing time.",
        "While they may be dry to the touch in a few hours, they may not be completely dry for a few days.",
        "Set your dog's bowl into the hole and fill it with food.",
        "If you made several holes for different bowls, you can fill each bowl with something different: canned food, kibble, and water.",
        "If you used a crate or storage unit for your dog's raised bowl, you could use it to store your dog's food."
