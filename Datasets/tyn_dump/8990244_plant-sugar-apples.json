You could also order seeds from an online retailer. If you obtain seeds from the flesh of a sugar apple, you\u2019ll have to wait one week after removing the seeds from the flesh before planting them. They don\u2019t germinate very well if you put them in the ground right away. Cut open your sugar apple fruit and pull out the big, black seeds. Put them in a seed envelope and wait one week prior to planting. If you purchased sugar apple seeds from a garden center, you don\u2019t need to wait before planting."

Soak the seeds with a bit of water. Place the seeds with the paper towel in a ziplock bag. Let your seeds soak for three days and then plant them. Alternately, you can scarify the seeds. Lightly sand the seeds. Then, soak them in warm water for twenty-four hours. In this way, you can speed up the seed preparation process and improve germination time."

Fill the seeding tray with fresh potting soil from the garden center, as opposed to soil from your garden. You\u2019ll want to moisten the soil a bit before planting the seeds.
