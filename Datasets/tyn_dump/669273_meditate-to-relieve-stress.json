                    "description": "The world is a distracting place and this may not be an easy request. However, a quiet spot where you can meditate without interruption is valuable when learning to meditate to reduce stress. As you become more proficient with meditation, outside distractions will bother you less and less. At first, many things will probably distract you. You will hear cars driving by, birds and people talking. It is best to turn off all electronic devices like cell phones and television to minimize things that could draw your attention away from your meditative task. A room with a door you can close usually works well but you can also get earplugs if needed. As you develop greater meditation skill, you will find that you can meditate anywhere\u2014even in high-stress situations, such as traffic, work or crowded stores."

                    "description": "All meditation uses controlled breathing. Breathing deeply helps your body and mind relax. In fact, effective meditation can be practiced just by focusing on your breathing. Breathe in through your nose and then out through your nose. You will want your mouth closed but relaxed while you breathe. Listen to the sound your breath makes. Use the diaphragm muscle to expand your lungs. Put your hand on your stomach. It should rise as you inhale and lower as you exhale. Breathe in and breathe out at regular intervals. Controlling your breath allows you to slow the rate of your breathing and fill your lungs with more oxygen per breath. Taking deep breaths relaxes the muscles of your upper torso, such as those in the shoulders, neck and chest. Deep diaphragm breathing is more efficient than shallow breathing with your upper chest area."
