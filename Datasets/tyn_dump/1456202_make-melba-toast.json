Using a sharp knife, cut the crusts off of all four sides of the toast and discard.

Small hors d'oeuvres may call for smaller toasts than toasts accompanying soup. Repeat the toasting and cutting process. Continue to toast and cut the bread until you have enough pieces for your event or the number of people you wish to serve. Finishing the Melba Toast Place the cut toasts on a baking sheet. The toasts should be placed on the sheet toasted side down, with the soft untoasted side up.

Lightly brush the untoasted side of each piece of toast with melted butter or olive oil. For sweet toast, you may also want to consider using coconut oil for a sweeter flavor. Toast the tops of the toast. Place the toasts in the oven or toaster oven on broil. Be sure to watch the toasts carefully, as they will brown quickly. If you have cut your toast into triangles, the corners may curl up. This is normal, but be sure to remove the toast before the corners burn.
