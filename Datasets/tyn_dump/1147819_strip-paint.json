The chemical stripper you choose will depend on the object you're stripping (such as a wall versus furniture), how many layers of paint you're dealing with, and how old the paint is. Citrus-based strippers like CitriStrip are more environmentally friendly than their traditional counterparts. These strippers are generally good for up to four layers of paint at a time, and are ideal for flat surfaces and some furniture. Pastes like SmartStrip and Peel Away 1 are ideal for tough jobs, and can even be used on uneven surfaces like brick. These types of strippers can remove up to 30 layers of paint at once, and require less scraping than other chemical stripper types. This type of stripper isn't great for furniture, as it can stain. Some paint removers contain methylene chloride, which is an old, effective, and fast-acting chemical stripper. While this chemical agent is good for most surfaces and jobs, it is very caustic and releases a large amount of volatile organic compounds."
