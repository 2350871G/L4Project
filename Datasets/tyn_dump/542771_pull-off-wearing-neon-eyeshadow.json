Makeup artist Yuka Arora says: \"I prefer using a matte finish for neon eyeshadows, because you can put matte anywhere, whereas shimmery shadows shouldn't go in your crease or just underneath it. I'd almost rather work with a glitter or a metallic liquid eyeshadow if I want something shiny. With a matte eye, though, you can do a pop of shimmer in the inner corner of your eye or the center of your eyelid to make it stand out.\""
