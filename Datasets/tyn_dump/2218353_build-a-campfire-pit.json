If you\u2019re not sure, don\u2019t build a fire! Check the local fire-danger level, which is usually displayed at ranger stations or along roads. If you can\u2019t find one, try looking online or calling the local government office. Respect established fire pits. Do not make a new fire pit unless it is necessary. Using established fire pits avoids damaging the soil and local flora."
