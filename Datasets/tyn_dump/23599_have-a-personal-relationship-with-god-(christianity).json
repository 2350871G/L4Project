To love God is to keep His commandments, and His commandments are not grievous (1 John 5:3). Hereby we do know that we know him: if we keep His commandments. He that saith, \"I know Him\", and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in Him. But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in Him. He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked (1 John 2:3-6). Moreover, Jesus said, If ye love me, keep my commandments (John 14:15). He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me: and he that loveth Me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him (John 14:21). If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in His love (John 15:10)."

To repent is to feel genuine sorrow for your sins and to desire to sin no more. If you continue to take pleasure in sinful acts, it is not genuine repentance. \"For All Have Sinned and Come Short of the Glory of God\". (Romans 3:23)\nAccording to Christianity Jesus as Savior is considered a gift from God and, he allowed himself to be whipped and to die for you so that you could receive the comforter which is the gift of the Holy Spirit \"Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.\" (John 16:6, see also John 14:26) Be in an attitude of prayer and thankfulness while praising God and blessing others at all times.  Ask God to give you the Holy Spirit and change you and mold you into whom he wants you to be. Be baptized for the forgiveness of sins (Acts 2:38). Receive the Holy Spirit. Know that when you receive the Holy Spirit that you are His child and that you will go and live with Him forever when you leave this earth one day. Commit your ways to the Lord, trust him to guide your path, and walk therein. Seek for things to happen in God's way and time, not yours. Get started, be patient to learn and serve, and your faith will grow. Tell others about God. \"Seek his Kingdom first and everything else will be added!\" Spend time with God, think on Him and the things of Him, and seek His will--to do it. Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. (Matt 5:14) Renew your mind as a Christian to do God's will. (Romans 12:2) You must renew it with the Word of God. Set aside personal time with God to read the Bible every day or at night before you go to bed -- for example, read these verses: II Cor 5:7, Jn 13:34-34, Jn 14:6,23,26,27 Jn 10:10, Phil 4:13,19, Eph 1:3, I John 2:27, Isaiah 24:3 Jn 6:27, Eph 6:10, Hebrews 10:16-17. Meditate and reflect upon God's word and pray regularly for his guidance in your daily life.",
