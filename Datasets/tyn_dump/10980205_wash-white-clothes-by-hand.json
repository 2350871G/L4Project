Treat these spots before you move on to hand washing, otherwise, the stain could become a permanent part of your garment. If you're on the go, carry a stain-remover pen with you to treat small spots that show up over the course of the day. If you can, treat a stain as soon as possible.

        "Never wash your white clothes with dark clothes.",
        "Drain the water from the tub and refill it with cool water.",
        "After you're done washing the clothes, pull the plug and let the sudsy water drain away.",
        "Push the wet clothing to the side and refill the tub rather than just running water from the faucet directly through the fabric\u2014this could stretch the material out.",
        "You don't need to fill the tub back up all the way.",
        "Just fill it enough so that the clothing is completely submerged and you have some room to swish it about some more.",
        "Continue swishing the clothing until all the soap suds are gone.",
        "Clear away the suds by moving the clothing about in the cool water.",
        "If you need to, drain and refill the tub again until you're sure it has all come clean.",
        "Having used the appropriate amount of detergent really pays off at this stage.",
        "If you didn't measure and used too much, you may be standing at the sink for a while rinsing out the excess suds.",
        "Smell the clothes if you're not sure all the soap is gone.",
        "A strong scent indicates there is still detergent that needs to be rinsed away.}}",
        "Drying Hand-Washed Clothes Squeeze the excess water out of the clothes very gently.",
        "Don't wring the clothes or twist them, as that could stretch out the fibers and misshape the clothing.",
        "Instead, gather the clothing in your hands and simply press the fabric together, moving it around and reshaping it to access all areas.",
        "Continue doing this until the garment is no longer dripping wet.",
        "If you do wring the fabric, use the amount of force you'd use to open a bottle of water.",
        "Put the clothing on a dry, clean, lint-free white towel.",
        "Lay out a white towel on a waterproof surface, then spread out your while clothing on the towel.",
        "Go ahead and unfold or un-bunch the clothing so it lays as flat as possible.",
        "Towels that have been washed and dried a few times should be primarily lint-free.",
        "Roll up the towel and press down on the clothing to absorb the water.",
        "Either roll the towel up so that the garment is spiraled around the inside of the towel, or fold the towel up into equally-sized sections.",
        "Then firmly press down on the towel with your hands.",
        "Continue pressing down all over the towel so that you hit every area and soak up as much water as possible.",
        "Use another towel if the first one gets too wet and can't soak up any more water.",
        "Dry the clothing in the sun for a natural bleaching effect.",
        "Use a clothesline and clothespins if your garment isn't too delicate to be hung.",
        "If it looks like it's going to rain or if it's wintertime, you'll be better off using a drying rack indoors.",
        "If you do line dry your clothes outside, don't forget to bring them in before you go to bed.",
        "Early morning dew will make them wet again and could cause them to wrinkle.Alternative: If the item can't be hung to dry and you don't have a drying rack, lay it out on top of a clean white towel and reshape it.",
        "Flip it over occasionally so it dries evenly.",
        "Iron the item if it is wrinkly and put it away once it has dried.",
        "Revisit the care label to see if the item can be ironed.",
        "If so, and if it needs it, take a few moments to iron it before putting it away so that the wrinkles don't set into the fabric more deeply.",
        "Hang up your clothes or put them away in drawers to keep them in good shape for the next time you want to wear them.",
        "Putting away clothes as soon as they have dried will help keep them from getting wrinkled in the first place."
