                    "description": "Many farmers spray their oats and simple grains, like barley or quinoa, with glyphosate so they dry out more and get a better harvest. Check the label or packaging to see if the grain you buy is from an organic source since they won\u2019t have any chemical treatments on them. If you can\u2019t tell if a product is organic or contains glyphosate, then check online to see if there is more information on it. Glyphosate can be found in cereals, bread, oatmeal, and granola bars. Glyphosate isn\u2019t listed in the ingredients section on processed foods, so your food may have trace amounts of glyphosate in it. The FDA and EPA have set maximum glyphosates levels for foods and produce so you aren\u2019t exposed to dangerous levels. You do not need to get rid of any foods in your pantry that already contain glyphosate since most concerns are over long-term exposure."

Some common produce that has glyphosate are soybeans, peas, carrots, sweet potatoes, and corn. There may be trace amounts of glyphosate in organic food due to wind-blown contamination.
