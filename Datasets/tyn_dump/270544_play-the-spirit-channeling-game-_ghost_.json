        "Once you have run out of cards, you can deal another 11 card to receive more answers.",
        "In total, you may deal 11 sets of cards three times.",
        "If you deal your answer cards a fourth time, you will be bound by the characteristics of that number.",
        "The number \"4\" represents totality or perfection, but is also associated in many numerologies as an unlucky number.",
        "Specify your questions to get better answers.",
        "Messages that come through the veil from the spirit world are often jumbled and confused.",
        "Because of this, the more complicated the question you ask, the more likely the answer you receive might not make sense.",
        "If you receive the answers \"I don't know\" or \"Maybe\" to many of your questions, you may have summoned a weak ghost that doesn't know much.",
        "Try different summoners and different locations.",
        "Some places are full of spiritual energy, making these more ideal for the summoning of and communication with spirits.",
        "People operate on a similar principle; some people have a natural talent for connecting with the spirit world.",
        "Using a Coin and Spirit Board Collect your supplies for communicating with the spirits.",
        "You'll need to make a spirit board to channel the energies flowing from the spirit world into answers to your question.",
        "This method is less dependent on the skills of the medium, so it's a good option for beginners.",
        "To make your spirit board and communicate with a ghost, you'll need:\nPaper\nPencil\nCandles (5)\nLighter/matches\nSalt (rock salt preferred)\nFriends (optional) Locate yourself where your summoning won't be disturbed.",
        "Bright light and loud noise can interrupt the flow of spirit energy from the spirit world into your spirit board, making it difficult to get the answers you seek.",
        "You might consider:\nWaiting until late at night.",
        "Finding a remote location.",
        "Prepare your spirit board.",
        "Take your blank sheet of paper and write every letter of the alphabet on it along with the numbers zero through nine.",
        "You should use large handwriting and leave some space between the letters and numbers to make interpreting the message from the spirits easier.",
        "You may also want to include the words initium and terminus on your spirit board.",
        "These terms mean \"start\" and \"end\" in Latin, respectively.",
        "Open a spirit channel from your spirit board to the realm of ghosts.",
        "Lay your spirit board so that it is flat on the floor or table where you intend to summon your ghost.",

        "Then:\nPlace a candle at each of the four points of the compass around the outside of the circle of protection and light each.",
        "Place your fifth candle above the topmost edge of the middle of your board and light it as well.",
        "Place a coin on your spirit board and invoke the spirits.",
        "Do not place your coin on any letters or numbers, instead place it on a blank space on your spirit board.",
        "Then, join hands with any friends that are with you around the spirit board, and say:\n\"Spirit, we call to you from beyond the veil.",
        "Answer our call.\"",
        "Determine if your summoning worked.",
        "Sometimes, the alignment of the stars or other factors in nature can close the doors of the spiritual world, making communication with spirits all but impossible.",
        "To make sure you have a good connection with the spirit world through your spirit board, you should first ask:\n\"Spirit, are you willing to speak with us tonight?\"",
        "Touch the coin to provide it with energy and get your answer.",
        "Have each person involved in the summoning place a single finger on the coin lightly.",

        "After waiting a period of time, the coin should begin to move, pausing for moments on letters and numbers.",
        "Record all places the coin pauses until it either stops moving or comes to a rest on the word terminus, or \"end\" in Latin.",
        "Interpret the meaning of the message.",

        "You may not be able to decipher a message right away.",
        "If you are talking to a particularly lively spirit, you may want to have a member write down each of the letters or numbers indicated by the pausing of the coin."
