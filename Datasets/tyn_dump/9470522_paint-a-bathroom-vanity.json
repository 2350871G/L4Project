Choose a satin finish to have a nice, light sheen that\u2019s not too shiny. Chalk paint is a quick, easy option with a smooth, flat finish. It dries fast and because it\u2019s thick, it requires fewer coats of paint. However, its thick consistency also means it\u2019s easy to leave brush marks.

Mitchell Newman, the Principal of Habitar Design and Stratagem Construction, says: \"In a bathroom, it helps to use slightly glossier paints, because they're more durable, and your cabinet is going to get a lot of traffic.

They go on similar to an oil-based paint, but they're actually water-based, so they have very low VOC and are extremely durable.\""

Set these aside where they will be out of the way while you work on the vanity. This will help prevent mess and damage from the paint. Spread a dropcloth on the floor around the vanity.

        "As you\u2019re putting items back into the vanity, think about how often you use them.",
        "If you\u2019ve barely or never used them, get rid of them to make more space inside your new vanity.",
        "Revamp the hardware to give the vanity a whole new look.",
        "Switch out your drawer and cabinet handles for new hardware.",
        "Try hardware in a different metal, glass knobs, or handles instead of knobs.",
        "This will complete the vanity\u2019s transformation and make it feel brand-new.",
        "Patch up scratches by gently sanding and painting over them.",
        "Use a very fine grit sandpaper to lightly sand the chipped area.",
        "Then use a brush with the same paint that\u2019s already on the vanity and paint over the scratch.",
        "Try to fill the scratch in with the paint so it looks level with the rest of the surface.",
        "Let the paint dry for a few minutes, and the vanity should look as good as new.",
        "Very fine sandpaper includes grits of 240, 320 and 400."
