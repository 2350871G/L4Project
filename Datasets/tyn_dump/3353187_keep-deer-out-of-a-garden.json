The fewer of these you keep in your garden at a given time, the less likely they are to provide a mouth-watering feast for a grazing deer herd. This will be more difficult if you maintain a farm or large vegetable garden, but you can still lower your chances of having your crops ravaged by keeping them in rotation and harvesting them as soon as they\u2019re ripe. Keep your garden well-manicured and maintained. Harvest fruits and vegetables as soon as they are ripe to cut down on the chances that they'll be devoured. Also, make sure to clean up any debris from fruit trees and any other fruit and vegetable producing plants in your garden. Keep your lawn cut as well to avoid creating an inviting place for deer to lay down. This will reduce the chances that deer will be attracted to your yard. Do some research on the types of crops that deer prefer and only plant one or two of these at a time."

Take advantage of this and grow bright, attractive plants and plump fruits and vegetables close to your home, far away from the outer perimeter of your garden where deer are most likely to infiltrate. In order to get to them, the deer will have to risk getting close to the hub of all the noise and activity they fear. Lush rose and tulip bushes make excellent ornamentation for the outside of your home where they will conveniently be the safest."

Ready-made tomato cages can be found at most lawn and garden stores, or you can put them together yourself at home using basic, inexpensive materials. The openings in the cage are too small for deer to reach the plants within, but are big enough to allow you to water, prune and pick fruits and vegetables by hand.

Just make sure the fence or hedge is tall enough to keep the deer from seeing what\u2019s on the menu in your yard. Deer are prodigious jumpers, and a barrier shorter than about six feet won\u2019t stand a chance. Growing a hedge to serve as a screen requires patience and upkeep, but is arguably the more aesthetic option than walling off your beautiful landscaping with a solid structure. If space allows, consider erecting a double fence or hedge with an inner and outer barrier. This will make it harder for the deer to clear with a bound. You may also consider planting prickly foliage to deter deer, such as barberries and lamb\u2019s ear. Plant these near the entrance to your garden as well as around plants you want to protect."
