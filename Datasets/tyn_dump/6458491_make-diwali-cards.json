Sprinkle glitter over the glue before it dries. Alternatively, add small dots of craft glue on the background of your card. Firmly push a sequin or gem onto each spot of glue. Making a Card with Diwali Stickers Fold the cardstock into a card. Use a rectangular piece of cardstock in the color and size that you prefer. Bring the corners of the cardstock together crosswise to fold it into the shape of the card. Decorate the front of the card using Diwali-themed stickers. Get creative with the stickers and decide how you want to arrange them before you stick them on. Add 1 large sticker to the center of the front of the card or use several smaller stickers to decorate the card.

You can cover the background of the front of the card with small dots of glitter glue or use the glitter glue to draw a pattern on the card. If you don\u2019t have glitter glue, use craft glue instead and sprinkle glitter over it. Making a Card with Iris Folding Fold a sheet of A3 cardstock in half. The size of A3 paper is 11.7 in \u00d7 16.5 in (30 cm \u00d7 42 cm). Bring each corner of the short edge over to the opposite corner and press down on the cardstock to create a fold. Draw the outline of a lantern on the front of the card and cut it out. Draw a hexagon that is approximately 3 in (7.6 cm) wide in the center of the card with a pencil. Then draw a thin rectangle above and below the hexagon to create a lantern shape. Make a gentle fold within each shape and use scissors to cut the shapes out, leaving only an outline of each shape. Cut out strips of colored paper in 3 different colors. Pick the colors that you want to use for your lantern.

Use the third color of the strips to cover the remaining parts of the lantern in a third direction. Use glue to attach the strips to the inside. The lantern will look as though it is made from a weaving pattern. This is called iris folding. Use a piece of cardstock to cover the iris folding on the inside of the card. Cut a piece of cardstock to size. Use glue to attach it behind the lantern, sticking to the inside of the card. Keep the card open while the glue dries to avoid gluing your card together. This means that you will only be able to see the iris folding from the outside of the card, as the inside will be covered. Draw tassels on the lantern using glitter glue. Use your favorite glitter glue to add wavy lines extending from the bottom rectangle of the lantern. You can also add glitter glue dots stemming from the lantern to create strings of lights.",
