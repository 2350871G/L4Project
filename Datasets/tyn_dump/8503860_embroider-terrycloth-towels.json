You want to get rid of any shrinking before you add the embroidery. Plan your embroidery design. You can use an existing design on your embroidery machine, purchase and download one online, or create your own using an embroidery-design program. Thicker, heavier designs work better than light, delicate ones. Great embroidery designs include:\nFlowers and birds\nMonograms\nDamask and filigree\nCeltic knots and Chinese knots Print your design onto a sheet of paper, then trim it down. This will be your template. If you can't print your design, get the length and width of it, and draw a rectangle onto a sheet of paper according to those measurements. Cut the rectangle out. Place the template onto the towel and mark the center and axis. A good way to find the center and axis on your template is to fold it into fourths, then to use the creases as your guides. Pin the template to your towel where you want the design to go, and make a small mark on the towel using a tailor's pen. Remove the template when you are done. Embroidering the Towel Attach a cutaway stabilizer to the back of the towel. Spray the back of a sheet of cutaway stabilizer with removable adhesive. Press the stabilizer against the back of your towel, right where the design is. Secure both layers with a hoop. Take the hoop from your embroidery machine. Set the inner hoop down first, then place the towel on top, stabilizer-side-down. Press the outer hoop down on top. Machine hoops are a little different from the standard embroidery hoop. Attach the hoop to your machine. Make sure that the excess towel is out of the way so that it won't get caught in the needle. Float the water-soluble topper on top of the towel and hoop. This will prevent the embroidery from sinking into the terrycloth. It will dissolve when you wash the towel. If you'd like to, you can run a basting stitch around the inside of the hoop to keep the topper in place. Set up your needle and threads. Use a size 11 or 75/11 sharp sewing needle. You could also use an embroidery needle instead. Make sure that all of your threads are in place. Set the machine up and allow it to embroider your design. Even though embroidery machines are automatic, you still want to watch it from time to time to make sure that it is behaving properly. This is especially important if you are working with metallic threads. Each machine is different. How you set things up will depend on the type of machine you have. Refer to your machine's manual. Wrapping it Up Remove the towel from the hoop. Once the machine is done embroidering, remove the hoop and snip off the excess thread. Pull apart the hoop and remove the towel. If you used basing stitches earlier, you will need to remove those first. Trim away the water-soluble topper. Use a small pair of scissors to carefully trim the topper away from around your design. Again, don't worry if it's not perfect. It will dissolve when you wash it. Trim the cutaway stabilizer away. Leave a \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) boarder) all around the design.
