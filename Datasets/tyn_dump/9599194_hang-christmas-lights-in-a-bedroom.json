        "Drape the lights up and around each Command hook.",
        "If your lights are electrical, plug them in to ensure they\u2019ll be long enough, feed the strand up to the the first hook, and hook it on.",
        "If your lights are battery-powered, simply hook 1 end of the strand onto the first hook.",
        "Then, drape the strand down the wall.",
        "Once you\u2019ve nearly reached the floor, feed the strand up towards the next hook and repeat.",
        "Continue doing this until you\u2019ve strung the lights up around each hook.",
        "If you have battery-powered lights, don\u2019t worry about flipping the switch to turn them on before you start hanging them.",
        "This is only necessary for electrical lights.",

        "Hang the curtain rod back up and adjust the curtains so that they\u2019re evenly spaced.",

        "Check all of the bulbs to make sure they\u2019re working.",
        "Fix any that aren\u2019t, or get a new strand of lights.",
        "1 100-light strand should be enough for this project.",
        "Hang 2 columns of Command hooks on your wall close to either edge.",
        "Since you\u2019ll be making a zigzag pattern on your wall with the Christmas lights, you\u2019ll need to install damage-free hanging Command hooks that are spread out and staggered in height.",
        "Read the instructions and install the hooks as directed.",
        "You should be able to install the hooks by pressing the back of the adhesive against the wall, pulling off the paper on the front of the adhesive, and pressing the back of the hook to it.",

        "Use clothespins to secure your favorite photos to the light strand.",
        "Pick out some of your favorite photos and hang them just below the light strand by securing them to it with a small clothespin.",
        "You can also hang up other items, such as concert tickets or drawings, to add a personal touch.",
        "If you opt to hang other things, stick with small, thin items that are made of paper.",
        "Otherwise, the lights may fall down and/or break as a result of having to hold up the heavy weight."
