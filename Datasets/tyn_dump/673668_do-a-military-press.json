        "Danny received his Personal Trainer Certification from the California State University, East Bay and the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM).",
        "Danny Gordon\t\t\tCertified Personal Trainer\t\t\t\tTry this tip from our expert: In a seated military press, I recommend sitting with your feet flat on the ground.",
        "Then, press through your heel as you lift.",
        "That will help stabilize your body, and it will activate not only the front of your leg, but also your hamstring.",
        "Use dumbbells for better shoulder isolation.",
        "Dumbbells are the one-handed weights, and they introduce a new set of challenges and benefits.",
        "Because they are not connected, you have to focus on keeping your wrists and hands still as you work out.",
        "This helps tone smaller muscles in your arm and improves your form.",
        "You can use them either standing or sitting.",
        "However, it also increases the chances of poor form and injuries if you aren't diligent about proper mechanics:\nKeep your palms facing the same direction the entire time.",
        "Make sure both hands go up to the same height and back down to the same height.",
        "Use slow, controlled movements to ensure that your arms go up in a straight line, not outward or curved.",
        "Turn your hands inward to work on different heads of your muscles.",
        "You'll work slightly different shoulder muscles if you turn your palms to face each other.",
        "This usually requires dumbbells, but you can also use a Swiss Bar, which is made for different grips.",
        "The rest of the motion is the same.",
        "Try a kneeling press to improve form and core stability.",
        "Kneel on a bench, with your feet hanging off the end, then perform a military press with dumbbells.",
        "Shortening your stance requires increased balance in your core, and proper mechanics become essential.",
        "If you lose your balance you've arched your back, moved your arms sideways, or otherwise used improper form.",
        "Fix it before continuing.",
        "Try different overhead presses to add variety to your workouts.",
        "The military press is the most common overhead press, but that doesn't mean it is the only one.",
        "Several other variations exist, with varying degrees of difficulty:\n\nJavelin Press: Hold a barbell in the center, like you were throwing a spear.",
        "Then, using only this arm, perform a military press while keeping the bar parallel to the ground.",
        "Tighten your core to prevent leaning or angling to this side.",
        "Bottoms-Up Press: In the normal start position (hands near chest), grip kettlebells so that the weight is above your hands.",
        "Your palms face forward.",
        "Press up like normal, keeping the weights above your hands.",
        "Your forearms get an increased workout, and your form needs to be perfect to keep the bells from dropping or sliding.",
        "Improving Form and Power Ensure you have the proper grip width with the thumb test.",
        "The right grip is largely a matter of comfort.",
        "However, if you're complete unsure where to grip the bar, or you're experiencing discomfort, you can do this simple test to find the right grip.",
        "Grab a weightless bar and set it in the start position across your chest.",
        "Point your thumbs inward, towards your neck.",
        "Slide your hands until the tips of your thumbs touch the outside of your shoulders.",
        "Stagger your feet for added stability and comfort.",
        "If you're struggling to keep your balance while pressing, put one foot 6-8\" forward and the other 6-8\" back.",
        "they should still be roughly shoulder-width apart.",
        "Having a straight, sturdy spine is much more important than having your feet even.",
        "Every set, switch which foot is forward and which is back.",
        "To keep from leaning forward, the front knee should be slightly bent.",
        "Slow down the movement and pause at the top for added burn.",
        "The slower and more controlled your movements, the better.",
        "Working slowly forces you to keep your balance, using your arms and core in tandem to keep everything smooth.",
        "You want fluid movements, and pausing at the top will cause a deep but satisfying burn.",
        "Sculpt your shoulders with smaller, more isolated exercises to build up muscle.",
        "If you're struggling with the military press, you might transition to smaller exercises to build up some muscles.",
        "After 3-4 weeks, you can then tackle the military press with new strength.",
        "Some good exercises include:\nShoulder Flies\nPull-ups\nPike Presses\nHome shoulder workouts."
