Tomatoes grow best in slightly acidic soil, with the optimum pH level being between 6.2 and 6.8. Soil that falls below 6.0 is too acidic for tomato plants to thrive. An even balance of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium is necessary for your tomato plants to produce lots of healthy fruit. Too much of 1 nutrient can affect the health of your tomato plants."

        "Add compost to help the soil retain moisture and nutrients.",
        "The compost will add a small but continuous amount of nutrients and will help the soil hold water and keep the roots from drying out.",
        "Cover the top of the soil with a 1 inch (2.5 cm) layer of compost, then mix it into the soil.",
        "Compost will also help any fertilizer that you add stay in the soil until it's needed by your tomato plants.",
        "You can find compost at garden supply stores, nurseries, or online.Tip: Choose a compost that includes minerals like granite dust and composted bark which will help your tomato plants adjust to the soil.",
        "Planting the Tomatoes Keep the soil covered with black plastic until you're ready to plant.",
        "A couple of weeks before you plant your tomatoes, you can start getting the soil temperature to heat up so there's less of a shock to the plants when you put them in the soil.",
        "Place a layer of black plastic over the tilled dirt so it can absorb the heat from the sun and warm up the ground.",
        "Remove the black plastic when you're ready to plant your tomato plants.",
        "Anchor the black plastic at the corners with rocks, bricks, or any other object heavy enough to keep it held in place.",
        "You can find rolls of black plastic at home improvement stores, garden nurseries, or online.",
        "Space the plants 2 feet (0.61 m) apart in rows 50 inches (130 cm) apart.",
        "You need to leave enough space around each plant to allow you to water them and pull out any weeds that grow.",
        "Align your plants into rows that are about 50 inches (130 cm) apart from each other so you can more easily navigate the garden when you harvest, water, and weed it.",
        "Make sure the rows are even so they're easier to water and access.",
        "Bury the plant so about two-thirds of the stem is covered.",
        "Burying much of the stem of the tomato plants will allow them to be stronger and better able to form new root systems as they adapt to the new soil.",
        "Dig a small hole into the soil, place the plant into it, and cover up the stem so that only about \u2153 of the tomato plant is exposed.",
        "Don't pile the soil up around the stem.",
        "Instead, dig a hole deep enough to cover the plant.",
        "Place 1 stake in the soil about 2 inches (5.1 cm) away from each plant.",
        "Tomato plants need a support system to keep them from falling over or drooping toward the ground.",
        "To avoid damaging the roots of the plants later, it's best to drive stakes into the ground when you plant the tomatoes.",
        "Use a 1 inch (2.5 cm) by 1 inch (2.5 cm) stake that is about 4 feet (1.2 m) tall.",
        "Drive the stake at least 6\u20138 inches (15\u201320 cm) deep into the ground.",
        "You don't need to tie the plants to the stakes until they're larger.",
        "Water the soil as soon as you plant the tomatoes.",
        "When you're finished planting all of your tomato plants into the soil, you need to water them immediately to help them settle in.",
        "Use a light sprinkler or a watering can so you don't bend or knock over any of the plants with the water.",
        "Thoroughly water the entire garden.",
        "Don't oversaturate or flood the garden.",
        "Add enough water to soak the top layer of soil.Tip: If a plant becomes more exposed after you water it, add more soil to make sure \u2154 of the stem is covered up."
