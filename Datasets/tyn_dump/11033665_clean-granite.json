To see if your granite needs to be resealed, pour a small amount of water onto its surface. If the water beads up into small balls, your granite is properly sealed. If it doesn't, your granite is unsealed, and you should avoid cleaning it\u2013 the water will seep into the porous rock and potentially damage it. Reseal your granite if it needs to be resealed by covering the granite in a specialized granite sealant and wiping away excess sealant after it rests. After multiple sealant applications, your granite will be safe to clean. As a general rule, it's a good idea to seal your granite about once per year to make sure that the stone doesn\u2019t get damaged and maintains its color."
