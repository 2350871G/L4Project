                    "description": "Lemon juice contains citric acid which is a natural bleaching agent. Therefore, applying lemon juice to elbows can help to lighten the skin. To use:\nCut a large lemon in half. Squeeze out some of the juice from both halves so that you have two hollow halves or \"cups\". Rub each lemon cup over your elbows. You can rub away any excess pulp, but don't wash your elbows for about 3 hours. This gives the lemon juice time to act more deeply. Wash off the lemon juice with some warm water. As lemon juice can be drying, you should moisturize the area with your favorite body moisturizer. Repeat this every day until the dark skin begins to fade. You should see a significant difference within a couple of weeks."

                    "description": "A mixture of heavy cream and turmeric works well to lighten the skin on elbows, particularly on people with darker skin tones. Turmeric is a natural bleaching agent which helps to reduce melanin in the skin. Get some heavy cream (or milk with a high fat content) and boil it until it thickens and becomes clotted. Mix in a half teaspoon of turmeric and blend into a paste. Apply this paste to your elbows (and knees) using a circular motion, let it sit for about 20 minutes, and then rinse it off with water. Be aware that turmeric can dye the skin a yellowish-orange color that\u2019s especially noticeable on pale skin. The color will fade after a day or two. You can also substitute yogurt for the heavy cream. You won\u2019t need to boil it to achieve the same color-changing effect."

Use a loofah or washcloth to apply with exfoliating shower gel to remove excess dead skin cells from your elbows. Alternatively, you can make your own sugar scrub by mixing 2 parts sugar (white or brown) and 1 part oil (almond, coconut, or olive). Just remember not to scrub too hard or too frequently, as this may hinder natural oil production and cause your skin to produce extra cells. This can make your elbows even darker. Scrub gently just once or twice a week. Be patient and you will soon notice a big difference."

Moisturize after each shower or bath (as hot water can act to remove natural oils from your skin), before you go to bed at night, and before you leave the house in the morning. For best results, use lotions which contain shea butter, jojoba oil, or olive oil. A heavy duty treatment is to apply a thick layer of petroleum jelly, coconut oil, or pure shea butter directly to your elbows before bed, then cover with a \"sock sleeve\" fashioned by cutting the foot of cotton tube socks. It is best to leave the protective sleeve on throughout the night, if you are able. Doing so allows you to apply a massive amount of moisturizer to your elbows without ruining your sheets. Additionally, the sock sleeve helps retain your body heat and liquefy the moisturizer, thereby assisting the absorption by your skin."
