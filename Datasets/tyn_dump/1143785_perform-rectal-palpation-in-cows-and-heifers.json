Often it's best to preg-check 2 to 5 months into the cow's gestation period, so that you know you are feeling for something larger than a golf-ball sized ovary. The sizes you should be feeling are according to how far along the cow is:2 months - size of a mouse\n3 months - size of a rat\n4 months - size of a small cat\n5 months - size of a large cat\n6 months - size of a small dog\n7 months - size of a Beagle\nThese size comparisons are useful if you have a dead premature calf that may have been aborted. A vet or bovine practitioner who has had more experience and has preg-checked more cows will be more accurate than one who has done only a few cows. Thus saying, the more practice you get or the more chances you get to preg-check cows, the more accurate you'll become."
