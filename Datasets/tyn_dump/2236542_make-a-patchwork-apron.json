This tutorial uses an apron pattern that covers most of the torso, but you can use a similar process with your own pattern. Find 2 to 4 types of coordinating, but different fabric. You will need to have 1/2 yard (46 cm) of 2 types of fabric to finish your apron. You can also use fabric scraps for the strips and larger pieces of fabric for the body. Choose your main fabric for the front body of the apron. Cut a 16 by 16 inch (41 by 41 cm) square with a rotary cutter and mat or a pair of fabric scissors. Cut a 18.5 by 18.5 inch (47 by 47 cm) square piece of fabric to use as the back of your apron. You should use different fabric than the front square of your apron, because you will fold the top of your apron down to reveal the fabric pattern on the back. Cut a strip of fabric 3 inches wide and 16 inches (8 by 41 cm) long. You should use different fabric from the front apron square. Try to use coordinating, but different fabrics for all of your strips because they will be sewn onto the front square of your apron. Cut another strip of fabric that is 3 inches wide and 18.5 inches (8 by 47 cm) long.  Cut your neck straps. You need 2 strips that are 1.5 inches wide and 18 inches (4 by 47 cm) long. You may choose to use the same fabric as your front square to create an interesting contrast. Cut your ties. You need 4 strips that are 3 inches wide and 18 inches (8 by 47 cm) long. Cut your pockets. You will need 2 6-inch (15-cm) squares. One should be made of the front square fabric and the other should be a contrasting fabric. Sew your Patchwork Apron Sew your borders. Pin the 3 by 16 inch (8 by 41 cm) strip to 1 side of the front square. Gather the fabric together and sew with a 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) seam allowance. Iron the seam down so that it lays flat. Pin a 3 by 18.5 inch (8 by 47 cm) strip to the abutting side of the front square. The 2 strips should connect at the end. Sew the strip onto the front square with a 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) seam allowance. Iron down the seam so that the project lays flat on your sewing table. Make your sashes. Layer 2 pieces of 3 by 18 inch (8 by 47 cm) strips together to make your sashes. Place the 2 right sides of the fabric together, in order to sew the sashes inside out. Crease 1 end of the strip diagonally at the end. Crease it firmly so that you can see the line when you sew. You will use this crease to sew a tapered sash. Sew around the perimeter of the sash. When you reach the end of each sash, sew at a diagonal along the crease, instead of sewing into the corners. Keep the opposite end of the sash open so that you can turn it inside out. Cut the extra fabric from the edges. Also, trim the extra fabric at the corner of the tapered end of the sash. Turn the sash inside out. Repeat this process with the other 3 by 18 inch (8 by 47 cm) pieces of sash fabric. Attach your sashes. Pin the sashes to the front of the main body of your apron. Pin them on either side of the apron, just above the corners where the border strips start. Pin the extra length of the sashes to the center of the front of your apron to keep them free of the sewing needle as you finish your project. Make sure you pin the open end of the sash to the body and leave the tapered edge free. Attach your apron backing. Place the 18.5 by 18.5 inch (47 by 47 cm) square right side down on top of the front of your apron. Smooth the fabric and pin the sides. Sew around the perimeter of the apron.

Make sure your straps do not get in the way and get sewed to your project in more than 1 place. Lay your apron on its back with the top up. The top is opposite the border strips. Finish the top of your apron. Fold the top corner down 6 inches (15 cm). Make sure it is even on both sides of the fold. Pin it in place. Place a button right above the point of the folded down triangle. Sew it onto the apron, affixing the folded down triangle to the body of the apron. Iron the top of the fold so that it lays flatly. Attach your neck straps. Place your 2 strips of neck strap fabric right side together. Sew around the perimeter, leaving 1 end open so that you can turn it. Iron the fabric so that it lays flat.
