The rope should rest comfortably beneath your rear. Pull the end through so that you have about two feet of slack to tie the knot. Make sure to use a rope that is thick enough to support your weight. If possible, use a dedicated climbing rope that is designed to hold up against the shock of a fall. Consider using climbing webbing."

Hold the loose end of the rope in your right hand. Then, pull the loose end up toward you through the loop, and wrap it around the base of the loop. Thread the end of the rope back through the loop.

The loose short end of the rope serves to secure your leg. The long end will loop around the other leg, and will eventually become the \"crosspiece\" to which you clip the carabiner."
