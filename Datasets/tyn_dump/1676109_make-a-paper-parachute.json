If you would like to decorate your parachute sail, place the napkin on top of a piece of newspaper, cardboard, or scrap paper. Use felt tip markers to draw on your sail. Cut 4 even pieces of string. Unwind the string and cut off a strand that is approximately 1 foot (0.30 m) long. Unwind the string. Lay the cut strand next to the unwound string as though it were a ruler.

To change the speed, attach a heavier item to your parachute, like a rock, or create a smaller parachute sail. Feel free to experiment with different weights and sail sizes. Making Parachutes out of Tissue Paper Cut out a square parachute sail from a piece of tissue paper. Unfold a sheet of tissue paper and lay it on a flat work surface. Use a ruler and pencil to measure and mark a square with side lengths of 14 inches. Cut out the square with a pair of scissors. Place scotch tape around each corner and punch a hole into in corner. Retrieve a roll of scotch tape and rip four 1 inch (2.5 cm) pieces. Set the pieces on the edge of your work space. Place 1 piece of tape on the top left corner\u2014place \u00bd inch on the top of the tissue paper, fold the tape over, and adhere it to the bottom of the tissue paper. Insert the reinforced corner into a hole punch and create a hole. Repeat this process on the remaining corners. The tape will reinforce the corner and prevent the tissue paper from ripping. Cut four strings 16 inches (40.6 cm) in length. Unwind the string and cut off a strand that is approximately 16 inches (40.6 cm) long. Unwind more string. Lay the cut strand next to the unwound string to use as a ruler. Cut the second strand the same length as the first. Cut 2 more lengths of string. Insert 1 sting into each corner hole. Thread 1 string into the top left corner of the tissue paper sail. Tie the string in a loose loop. Tie 1 string in each of the 3 remaining corners. Tie the strings together and attach paperclips. Gather the 4 strings together 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the bottom. Tie the strands together in a knot. Hook 3 to 7 paperclips in a chain to the bottom of the strings. Hook the first paperclip over the knot. Release your paper parachute. After completely the construction of your parachute, it is ready to launch. You may release the parachute from the highest point in your house, the top of your favorite outdoor play place, or throw it up in the air. Once you have selected a launch zone, climb up, release your parachute, and observe it until it reaches the ground safely. Making Parachutes out of Coffee Filters Cut 2 even lengths of dental floss. Unwind and cut one 2 foot (0.61 m) strand of dental floss. Unwind more dental floss from the roll. Cut a second 2 foot (0.61 m) strand of dental floss. Punch 4 small holes through the coffee filter. Spread out the pleats of a coffee filter and fold it in half. Use a pair of scissors to create 1 set of 2 small slits approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) below the fold line and 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the left outer edge. Repeat on the right side. Insert 1 string into each hole and secure the ends with tape. Unfold the filter. Insert 1 end of a strand of floss into the top left hole. Pull 1 inch (2.5 cm) of floss through the slit and attach it to the top of the filter with a piece of tape. Insert the other end of the strand through the bottom left hole. Pull 1 inch (2.5 cm) of floss through the slit and attach it to the top of the filter with a piece of tape. Repeat on the right. Place 1 string under each arm of an action figurine and watch your toy float to safety. Select an action figure or a Lego figure. Place 1 string under each of the action figure\u2019s arms.

Tape 1 string to each corner of the parachute sail.

Attach the string to the sail with a piece of scotch tape. Attach 1 piece of string to each of the 3 remaining corners in the same manner. Knot the strings together and attach a weighted object. Collect the 4 strings together 3 to 4 inches from the bottom. Tie the strands together in a knot. Select an object to attach to the parachute, such as a rock, an action figure, or paperclips. Use the 3 to 4 inch (7.6 to 10 cm) tails to secure the object to the parachute. Launch the parachute. Once you have put away all of your tools, it is time to try your parachute.
