                    "description": "Use a soft measuring tape to determine the circumference or perimeter of your sink\u2019s bowl. Once you have an exact measurement, write it down so you can remember it later. Next, measure the distance between the lower rim of your sink bowl and the floor. Add this measurement to your notes, so you can figure out how much material you need to cover your sink. If you\u2019re measuring a circular sink, hold 1 end of the tape along the left side of the bowl\u2019s rim, then drag it around the curve of the bowl until you reach the right side of the sink. If your sink is especially large, you might want to ask a friend or family member for help. If you\u2019re measuring a square or rectangular sink, measure the right, left, front, and back sides of the sink individually (if applicable). Take note of each separate measurement, then add them all together to get an idea of your sink\u2019s perimeter. If you want, you can use a meter stick or metal measuring tape for this. A sink skirt is attached beneath the rim of your sink. Depending on the type of sink you have, the location of this rim may vary. For instance, a pedestal sink generally has a curved rim. For instance, if your sink is 13 by 17 in (33 by 43 cm), your sink skirt would need to be at least 43 in (110 cm).Tip: You can buy a sink skirt online for under $10. Some stores list them as \u201csink curtains.\u201d"

Once the full skirt length plus the extra hem is sketched out, use a pair of fabric scissors to cut out the section of fabric. You can find fabric at any store that sells craft supplies.

        "Check that the Velcro is arranged in a straight line along your fabric so the skirt can fit evenly around the sink.",
        "Sew a line of Velcro on the top edge of your fabric skirt.",
        "Pin the length of Velcro in place along the upper hem of your sink skirt to hold it in place.",
        "Next, use a needle and thread or a sewing machine to stitch the Velcro strip into place.",

        "Determine the height of your sink by holding a measuring tape in place beneath the lower rim of the sink bowl, then extending the tape downwards until you reach the floor.",
        "Next, extend your tape along the back edge of the sink bowl so you can get an idea of how long it is.",
        "Additionally, find the width by measuring from the wall to the front rim of the sink.",
        "These measurements can be useful if you choose to place cabinets, plants, or other items beneath your sink.",
        "For instance, if your sink is 3 ft (91 cm) long, 4 ft (120 cm) tall, and 2 \u20442 ft (76 cm) wide, you wouldn\u2019t want to invest in a cabinet that\u2019s 4 ft (120 cm) long, 3 ft (91 cm) high, and 3 ft (91 cm) wide.",
        "Instead, look for a cabinet that\u2019s around 2 ft (61 cm) high, 1 \u20442 ft (46 cm) wide, and 2 ft (61 cm) long.",
        "Install a cupboard or shelf in front of the pipes if you want more storage space.",
        "Visit your local home improvement or furniture store to browse through different drawers, cabinets, and shelves.",
        "Before making any purchases, check the dimensions of the furniture against the available space beneath your sink.",
        "If you don\u2019t want to permanently install a new fixture in your bathroom, look for smaller, portable cabinets or shelves that can be assembled and arranged in front of your sink\u2019s pipes.",
        "When shopping for cupboards or cabinets, look for items that have an opening or space in the back to store and conceal any sink pipes.",
        "Invest in a bottle trap system to make your pipes look stylish.",
        "Visit a home improvement store and browse for a simple fixture to install around your pipes.",
        "Choose a bottle trap that matches the color of your pipe, so your sink pipes can look sleek and polished.",
        "If you don\u2019t feel comfortable installing this fixture yourself, ask a home improvement professional for help.",
        "Bottle trap systems tend to be on the expensive side when compared to other pipe concealing options.",
        "Cover the pipes with a pedestal basin if you have a pedestal sink.",
        "Check online or in a home improvement store and look for pedestal basins, which are covers designed to conceal the exposed pipes beneath pedestal sinks.",
        "Use the measurements of your own sink to compare the pedestal basins to the sink in your own home, and see if you can find a product that meets your needs.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a lot of hardware expertise, a professional at your local home improvement store may be able to help you physically install the basin.",
        "Pedestal basins are typically round sinks that are built into or against the bathroom wall.",
        "A basin covers the exposed pipes and serves as the \u201cpedestal\u201d portion of the sink.",
        "If possible, try to determine the manufacturer of your current sink\u2014that could make it easier to find a basin that fits correctly.",
        "Place a tall basket or storage bin in front of the pipes as a temporary solution.",
        "Search around your home for any extra basins, bins, or other portable storage items that you could fit under the sink.",
        "If you don\u2019t have anything on hand, visit your local furniture store, or any shop that sells storage bins or baskets.",
        "Arrange any tall baskets or storage bins in front of the sink pipes to obscure them from view.",
        "Depending on the size and curvature of your sink, this might not be a viable option.",
        "For instance, a rectangular storage bin probably won\u2019t fit beneath a round, circular sink.",
        "Coat your pipes with paint if you don\u2019t want to add any new fixtures.",
        "Set down drop cloths and plastic sheeting around and beneath your sink.",
        "To prevent any paint from dripping onto your sink, apply strips of painter\u2019s tape around the base of the sink.",
        "Next, dip a wide, 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) paintbrush into a bucket or painting tray filled with paint designed for metal or PVC pipes.",
        "Choose a color that matches the tiling, walls, or some other feature in your room, so your pipes blend in.",
        "Visit a home improvement or hardware store to find paint that\u2019s safe to use on metal or PVC piping.",
        "Read the guidelines on your paint can to see how long the paint will take to dry.",
        "While you probably won\u2019t bump into the pipes while you use the sink, it\u2019s important to keep in mind in the days and hours after you apply the paint.",
        "Use potted plants to obscure the exposed pipes for a simple solution.",
        "Visit a plant nursery to find a large, indoor plant that you can arrange beneath your sink.",
        "Specifically, look for something that will fit within the measurements of your sink and block any view of the pipes.",
        "If you want extra coverage, purchase an additional plant to arrange beneath your sink.",
        "A corn plant, olive tree, or croton might be good options to consider.Tip: Choose plants that can thrive in the humidity and light conditions of your bathroom.",
        "For instance, if your bathroom has no windows, don\u2019t select a plant that requires lots of direct sunlight."
