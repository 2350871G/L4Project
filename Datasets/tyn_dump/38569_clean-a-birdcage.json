Rinse the dishes before lathering with soap, then rinse the soap off under hot water for several seconds. Once the bowl is clean, dry thoroughly with a clean towel. Some dishes may be dishwasher safe. Check to make sure that your dishes are dishwasher safe before placing them in the dishwasher, and make sure you use an animal-safe detergent. Animal-safe dish soaps and detergents are often available at local pet stores, online, or in grocery stores that carry environmentally-friendly cleaning products. It may also be useful to have two or three sets of dishes on hand if you do not have time to properly clean and dry the dishes every day. Often, the bird can stay in the cage during daily cleanings. However, if you think the bird is a flight risk, you may want to consider keeping an alternate cage where the bird can stay while you clean."

Newspaper lining or any other recycled paper lining should be free of colored ink, as some pigments used in some inks may be toxic to birds.

These are available at pet stores as well as specialty bird stores.
