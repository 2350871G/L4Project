                    "description": "More mature blossoms are more likely to lose petals through air drying, so it's best to choose flowers that have just bloomed and haven't fully opened yet. If you are picking flowers from your own garden, go out in the morning after the dew has evaporated. Flowers that air-dry well include marigolds, lavender, roses, cornflowers, and hydrangeas."

Cut the stems no shorter than 6 inches (15 cm). Longer stems are easier to bind. You can always cut the stems after the flowers are dry."

Make sure the flowers are tied tightly enough so that they don't slip out, but not so tightly that you're crushing the stems. Crushed stems can stay damp and get moldy."

A well-ventilated space will help the flowers dry out more quickly. Keeping the flowers out of direct sunlight will help them retain a little bit more color. The flowers should be dry in around 2-4 weeks. The flowers will change color as they dry and become less vibrant."
