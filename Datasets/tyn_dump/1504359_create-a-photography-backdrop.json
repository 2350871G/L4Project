Put out a plastic sheet, and use painter's tape to secure it to the floor so it doesn't move around. This sheeting needs to be big enough to go under your backdrop plus some, so pick one up from the hardware store. This will work best on a hard surface. If you only have a carpeted space, try putting a large piece of cardboard down."

Make sure to leave space around each edge on the plastic so you have room to go past the canvas a little when you're painting. You'll need at least 1 foot (0.30 m) on each side. Secure it to the plastic on the back with pieces of painter's tape rolled up on themselves to make double-sided tape. You can purchase canvas from craft stores, but you can also buy a linen canvas dropcloth from the hardware store. The size is up to you, but 9 by 12 feet (2.7 by 3.7 m) is a good size. It should allow you to shoot full-body shots with small groups of people."

An extended roller will make this process easier. Make sure this is your darkest color because it will allow the other colors to pop out in front. Apply more than 1 layer to get an even coat.

You can sponge it on, or you can even splatter it on. If you want the colors blended, use a clean string mop to rub the colors together using a circular motion. Make sure to blend the colors while they are still wet. You can also splatter colors on after you've blended your other colors well. Pick colors that add depth to the painting but that don't stand out too much. For instance, if you start with a midnight blue as a background, you may want to add a dark grey and a muted olive green."

When you do roll it up, place an extra sheet of plastic on top of the canvas, and then roll it up with the layer of plastic underneath. Stick it in a cardboard tube made for backdrops to store it. You can buy these tubes online or at photography stores. Store it in a cool, dark location."

Wrap the top of the streamer over the string and tape or glue it in back. Add more streamers, alternating colors, until you have enough to form the width of the backdrop. Make knots in the ends of the string and hang it up with tacks or hooks. The length depends on what kind of shot you're doing. If you want a full-length body shot with an adult, it will need to be 5 to 6 feet (1.5 to 1.8 m). If you're taking pictures of a child, it may only need to be 3 to 4 feet (0.91 to 1.22 m) in length. At a minimum, it should be 4 to 5 feet (1.2 to 1.5 m) wide. For a backdrop you can use over and over, try tying lengths of ribbon on the string instead."
