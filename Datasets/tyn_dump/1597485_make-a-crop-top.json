Sewing a Crop Top Choose 1 yard (0.9 m) of a fabric that has some stretch to it. Opt for a cotton jersey or another type of stretchy fabric that you like to make your crop top. This will help to ensure that the crop top will be form-fitting and flattering. You can use a print or solid fabric. Avoid fabrics that are bulky or rigid, such as wool, pleather, and velvet.

        "Write down the measurements.",
        "Measure the area around your waist where you want the bottom of the crop top to fall.",
        "For example, if you want the crop top to end at your belly button, then measure around this area.",
        "Measure at the widest part of your bust and upper arms.",
        "Cut out 2 pieces using the dimensions of your bust, waist, and desired crop top length.",
        "Fold your fabric in half and draw a rectangle on it that is half the width of your bust measurement on 1 side and half the width of your waist measurement on the other side.",
        "The rectangles should be the length of the distance between your bust and waist.",
        "For example, if your bust measurement was 34 in (86 cm), waist was 29 in (74 cm), and the distance between the 2 is 13 in (33 cm), then your rectangles would need to be 17 by 14.5 by 13 in (43 by 37 by 33 cm).",
        "Add 1 in (2.5 cm) to each of these measurements only if you plan to hem the fabric.",
        "Cut along the lines you have drawn on the fabric to ensure an even cut.",
        "Cut out 2 pieces for the 2 sleeves.",
        "Draw 1 rectangle on a piece of folded fabric that is the total width of your arm circumference by the desired length of your sleeves.",
        "Then, cut along the lines to get 2 equal-sized pieces.",
        "You may make the sleeves as long or as short as you want them to be.",
        "For example, if your arm circumference is 16 in (41 cm) and you want 6 in (15 cm) sleeves, then cut 2 rectangles that are 16 by 6 in (41 by 15 cm).",
        "Make sure to add 1 in (2.5 cm) to each of both measurements if you plan to hem the fabric.",
        "Follow the lines you have drawn on the fabric to ensure that you cut it evenly.",
        "Sew a zigzag stitch to secure the sides of the 2 body pieces.",
        "Stack the 2 body pieces so that the edges are even and the wrong (back) side of the fabric is facing out.",
        "Then, sew a zigzag stitch 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the edges of the 2 pieces that will be the sides of the crop top.",
        "The zigzag stitch is the best option for sewing stretchy fabric since it will stretch with the fabric.",
        "Fold each of the sleeves in half and secure them with a zigzag stitch.",
        "Fold the sleeves so that the wrong (back) side of the fabric is facing out.",
        "Then, sew a zigzag stitch 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the raw edges of the fabric.",
        "This will secure each of the sleeves in a circle.",
        "Cut the excess threads from the edges of the sleeves after you finish sewing the seams.",
        "Hem the edges of the sleeves and body if desired.",
        "Most stretch cotton fabric does not require a hem, but you may hem the edges of your sleeves and body piece if desired.",
        "Fold over the raw edges of the fabric by about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) and sew to secure the folded fabric on the inside of the shirt and sleeves.",
        "Make sure that the fabric is folded so that the raw edges will be hidden on the inside of the shirt.",
        "Fold the raw edges towards the wrong (back or inside) of the fabric.",
        "Cut the excess thread after you finish hemming the shirt.",
        "Attach the sleeves to the sides of the crop top.",
        "With the body and sleeves turned inside out, match up the corner of 1 sleeve\u2019s inner seam with the top corner of the crop top.",
        "Sew a straight stitch in the shape of a square or diamond around the edges where the sleeve and body piece overlap.",
        "Then, repeat on the other side of the body piece to secure the other sleeve.",
        "Cut the excess thread when you are finished, and then try on your crop top!",
        "It is finished!"
