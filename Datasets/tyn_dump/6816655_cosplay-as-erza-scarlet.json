You can go to a stylist to have it professionally done, or you can purchase a home dye kit. It\u2019s good to take a picture with you to the stylist so that he or she can match the color to how you want it. If you do not want the expense and long term commitment of dying your hair, you can simply purchase a wig similar to Erza\u2019s hair. When you dress with this option, be sure that your own hair is kept up tightly under the wig."

If you already have bangs, you can style them to the side to match Erza\u2019s style. If you go to a stylist, it is good to take a picture for this look, too. If you don\u2019t want to cut your hair into bangs, but you aren\u2019t wearing a wig, you can buy clip in bangs to give your hair the finishing touch."

To add some extra style to the look, give your hair a  shiny, healthy look. Erza has very straight hair, so to make the cosplay look right, this part is important."

To keep the costume cheap, you can shop at thrift stores to find a good shirt. As an added flourish, you can tie a thick blue ribbon under the collar of your shirt. Tie a nice bow in the front.

If you want to pluck them into shape, you can, but otherwise covering them with concealer will help. Then you can mix red and black eyeshadow to draw nice straight eyebrows. This is another aspect of the costume that is not absolutely vital, but it will create a more thorough Erza look."
