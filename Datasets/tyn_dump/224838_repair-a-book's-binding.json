Make sure you purchase an acid-free glue: if you use a glue with acid in it, it can cause the pages of your book to disintegrate or eat away at the spine of the book. Remove the loose pages. Set them aside so you don\u2019t get any glue on them. Make sure you set them aside in the right order. You don\u2019t want to accidentally glue them back into your book out of order! Apply a thin layer of the glue. Open the book and squeeze some glue onto the inside of the book\u2019s spine, where the pages have pulled away.

This helps keep all the pages evenly in place while the glue dries. You can also stack other, heavier books on top of the book you\u2019ve repaired. Let the book dry for 24 hours. After the 24 hours are up, carefully remove the rubber band (or other books) and gently flip through the pages of the book. They should all feel secure. If they don\u2019t, you may need to repeat the gluing process. Tightening a Gap Between the Pages and Spine Gather your equipment. You\u2019ll need book adhesive, knitting needles or plastic rods (for applying the adhesive), wax paper, and a piece of flat plastic. It\u2019s best if your adhesive is in a tall bottle, since this will allow you to cover the needles or plastic rods for application to the spine. Stand the book on its tail.

It\u2019s harder to repair a hinge that\u2019s still clinging to the book by threads, so removing it actually makes your life easier. Cut away any threads or loose paper so that the text block is even and clean. Cut a piece of single-stitched binder tape. You can find this type of tape in most craft stores.

You should be able to tell if the adhesive is dry by running your finger over the top \u2013 you\u2019ll be able to feel if there\u2019s any wetness under the tape. Place waxed paper on top of the text block and in the spine. You should lay it on top of the binder tape that is already glued to the text block and under the binder tape that hasn\u2019t been glued yet. Apply adhesive to the other two tabs. Then gently bring the cover up so the edge of the cover fits along the seam of the binder tape. Press the spine firmly against one tab. This should be the tab sitting parallel to the spine, between the spine and the text block. When you pull the cover up, the spine should lay flat against this tab. Attach the last tab to the cover. Smooth it with a flat piece of plastic so that it lays flat against the cover. Close the book and run your flat plastic piece along the spine so that the tab sticks to the spine. Secure with rubber bands and let dry overnight. The rubber bands will help all of the adhesive dry evenly and make sure that the tabs all lay flat against the spine and text block.
