Go over your face in a circular motion with your fingertips or a soft washcloth, then rinse away the cleanser when you\u2019re done.Tip: Make sure you use the right kind of cleanser for your skin type. For example, if you have oily skin, choose a salicylic acid cleanser. For dry or sensitive skin, stick to a mild, hydrating cleanser. If you like, you can use an exfoliating wash to buff out any rough spots. You can also gently exfoliate with a washcloth and your favorite cleanser. Don\u2019t exfoliate more than once or twice a week, though. After rinsing, gently pat your face dry with a clean, dry towel."

After you\u2019ve cleansed and dried your skin, put some toner on a cotton pad and wipe it over your face, neck, and chest. If you have dry skin, avoid alcohol-based toners. Stick to a toner with gentle, hydrating ingredients like rosewater or aloe vera. To reduce oil and breakouts, try a tea tree oil or witch hazel toner."

Apply the moisturizer all over your neck and face in an upward motion, using your fingertips.
