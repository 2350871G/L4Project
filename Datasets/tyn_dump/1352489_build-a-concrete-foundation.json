Shallow foundations are built on level ground and hard surfaces. Shallow foundations are no more than 3 feet (0.91 m) (91.44 cm) deep and are used primarily for smaller, simpler projects like holding patio furniture, a fountain, or an air conditioning unit. Deep foundations are used for more complex projects. Deep foundations are also used when soil conditions are poor or when building a structure on a hill. Deep foundations are more than 3 feet (0.91 m) (91.44 cm) deep and can have varying depths throughout. This type of foundation is suited for a shed or a detached garage."
