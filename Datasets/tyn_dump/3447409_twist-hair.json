        "Use a dab of gel and/or styling oil to maintain the twists.",
        "Rub the product in your hands, and apply it from your roots to your ends.",
        "Using styling product before you twist your hair helps the coils stay in position for several days.",
        "It also helps you define your twists, which in turn helps if and when you decide to unravel the twists.",
        "Separate the hair into 3 even sections as if you are braiding it.",
        "Once you have your individual section, divide it into 3 equally-sized strands to create your twist.",
        "Then, position the 3 sections side-by-side.",
        "This is the same basic steps you\u2019d take if you were braiding your hair, but instead of moving 2 of the 3 strands, you\u2019ll only adjust 1 of them.",
        "Bring the section of hair closest to your neck over top of the other 2.",
        "Look in the mirror as you twist your hair so you can clearly see each strand.",
        "Move the strand closest to your neck over top of the other 2 strands to reposition it on the opposite side.",
        "This creates the start of your twist.",
        "Continue moving the strand closest to your neck over the others.",
        "Once you move the first strand, bring the strand that is now close to your neck (the middle strand in the step above) over top of the other 2 strands.",
        "This strand now is furthest away from your neck.",
        "Continue this process until you reach the end of your hair.",
        "Secure the ends of your hair using styling product or a hair tie.",
        "When you get to the very end of the strand, leave about 1 in (2.5 cm) at the end.",
        "Apply a small dab of hair gel or coconut oil to the very end for a gentle hold.",
        "If you have curly hair, the twist should stay in place.",
        "For a more secure hold, wrap a small elastic hair tie around the end of the strand.",
        "This way, the twists do not come undone as you style your hair.",
        "Do this for all of your hair to create a more advanced twist style.",
        "After you create your first twist, grab a section of hair right next to the twist to make your next one.",
        "Continue doing this working from front to back until all of your hair is in twists.",
        "The three-strand twist is slightly more difficult to do than the two-strand twist, so this is a good idea once you master the two-strand technique.",
        "Maintaining Your Twists Rock your twists for 1-2 weeks.",
        "On average, your twists will stay in place for about a week or so.",
        "By using products and hair ties, you can keep your twists intact for up to 2 weeks.",
        "This is a great, short-term preventative style.",
        "After 1-2 weeks, undo your hair and try something new.",
        "For instance, wear your hair in two-strand twists for a few weeks, then try out the three-strand twist next.",
        "You can make your next twists a bit thinner or thicker if you\u2019d like.",
        "Retwist your hair if you notice any sections coming undone.",
        "If the ends of your twists start to unravel, simply twist them back into place and apply a bit more hair product.",
        "This way, you can extend the total time of your twist hairstyle.",
        "As the hairs loosen, the twists may appear bigger.",
        "This is perfectly normal, and if you don\u2019t like this look you can try twisting the hair tighter next time.",
        "Wear a silk cap when you sleep to help your twists last longer.",
        "To prevent your twists from coming undone or getting frizzy, put on a silk cap before you go to bed.",
        "Stretch the cap over your head, ensuring all of your twists are inside.",
        "You can purchase a silk cap at most beauty supply stores or online.",
        "Shampoo your scalp to wash your hair without undoing the twists.",
        "If you want to wash your hair but don\u2019t want your twists to come out, rub a dime-size amount of shampoo in your hands, and apply it directly to your scalp.",
        "Avoid getting much of the product directly on your twists.",
        "Massage your scalp with your fingers, and rinse out the shampoo completely.",
        "You can apply conditioner the same way to moisturize your scalp if you\u2019d like.",
        "Do this if your hair is very oily or if your scalp starts to itch.",
        "Creating Hairstyles with Twists Unravel each section to create a twist-out look.",
        "Sleep with your hair in a two-strand twist overnight, and gently unravel each twist the next morning.",
        "Shake your head from side to side to loosen the coils.",
        "Use a little coconut oil if your hair is dry, but pat it gently over your hair to keep it in a puffy shape.",
        "This is a cute, casual alternative to your twisted look.",
        "With this look, your hair is still curly and coiled, but the twists look relaxed and loose rather than tightly wrapped.",
        "If you did your twists when your hair was damp, you need to allow your hair to dry completely before unraveling your twists.",
        "You can also leave your hair in two-strand twists for 2-3 days for tight, kinky coils.",
        "Tie your twists into a ponytail for a simple updo.",
        "For a simple, classy look, grasp all of your twists at the crown of your head, and secure them using an elastic hair tie.",
        "Make sure your coils are all smooth and flat at the top of your head.",
        "This is an easy style great for casual day-to-day looks.",
        "For example, tie up your hair when running errands or grabbing lunch with friends.",
        "This is also a great way to keep your hair out of the way while exercising.",
        "Wrap your twists into a bun for an elegant evening style.",
        "Pull all of your twists back, and grip them at the crown of your head.",
        "Wrap a hair tie around your hair, but leave the ends secured in the elastic rather than pulling the hair all the way through.",
        "You can wrap 1 of your twists around the base of the bun for a cute touch.",
        "This is a simple, traditional style that looks great for work or for going out on a date."
