        "This is very important.",
        "You won't be turning your pillow inside out, so the right sides need to be on the outside from the very beginning.",
        "Trace your pillow or your shape onto the fleece.",
        "If you already have a pillow that you would like to use, put it down onto the fleece, and trace around it using a piece of chalk.",
        "If you don't have a pillow, simply draw a large circle or heart onto the fleece.",
        "Draw a second shape around the first one, leaving a 2 to 4-inch (5.08 to 10.16-centimeter) border between them.",
