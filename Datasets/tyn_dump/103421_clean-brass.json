But, older, antique pieces of brass typically don't have a lacquered coating. You can assess if a brass piece is lacquered by looking at its surface: it will have a clear finish covering the entire piece. Brass covered with lacquer will usually only tarnish if there is a crack in the lacquer coating. Lacquered brass is fairly easy to clean; all you really need is some soapy water. However, you might want to consider removing the lacquering if tarnish has formed underneath the lacquer finish. If you are still having trouble figuring out if your brass piece has a lacquered finish, remember that lacquered brass usually has more of a yellow shading."

        "Don't rub the paste too harshly into the brass piece.",
        "The abrasive salt/baking soda will gently remove the tarnish.",
        "Consider using a soft-bristled toothbrush to clean the nooks and hard to reach areas of your brass piece.",
        "Consider polishing your brass with commercial cleaners.",
        "There are many eco-friendly brass cleaners that remove tarnish and restore shine to brass pieces without scratching and damaging the surface.",
        "Sometimes, brass cleansers have an abrasive element in their formula, so be mindful to not damage fragile etchings on your brass piece.",
        "Stay way from muriatic acid.",
        "It does not properly clean brass, and can leave behind permanent stains.",
        "Undiluted white vinegar or ammonia can be highly effective in cleaning antique brass.",
        "Allow the brass piece to soak for an hour in either vinegar or ammonia.",
        "Both products are natural cleaning agents, and can give brass a lasting, shiny finish.",
        "Consider alternative brass cleaners.",
        "Although you can make your own brass cleaner at home or use commercial brass cleaners bought from the store, consider using some of these other natural ingredients to clean your brass pieces:\n\nKetchup.",

        "Let the ketchup sit on the brass surface for approximately 10 minutes, and then wipe the ketchup off with a clean, damp cloth.",
        "Dry the brass piece thoroughly.",
        "Yogurt.",
        "Cover your brass piece with plain yogurt.",
        "The lactic acid in the yogurt is what works to break down and dissolve the tarnishing on the brass.",
        "Allow the yogurt to dry on the brass, and then rinse it off with water, and dry the brass piece with a clean cloth.",
        "White vinegar and salt.",
        "Cover the brass piece with white vinegar (either by pouring or spraying the vinegar over the brass surface), and then sprinkle salt over the vinegar.",
        "Wet a cloth with a little bit of vinegar, and gently wipe down the brass.",
        "Dry with a clean  cloth.",

        "James is an expert in all things clean and provides transformative experiences by reducing clutter and renewing your home environment.",
        "James is a current Trustee Scholar at the University of Southern California.",
        "James Sears\t\t\tCleaning Guru\t\t\t\tKetchup cleans brass because it is slightly acidic.",
        "The tomato juice in ketchup adds acidity to the condiment, which makes it able to clean brass.",
        "Let the ketchup sit, then rinse it off and wipe away any tarnish.",
        "You can also rub lemon juice or half a lemon on the object to remove tarnish.",
        "Protect your brass from future tarnish.",
        "After you're finished cleaning your brass piece, protect it from future tarnishing by applying a lacquered finish.",
        "You can apply the lacquer using either a paintbrush or a cotton ball.",
        "Consult the instructions on the lacquer container to see the manufacturer's suggestions.",
        "However you decide to apply the lacquer, be sure to only put on a thin layer.",
        "Watch for any dripping lacquer, because the drippings can dry, leaving your brass piece covered in drip streaks.",
        "Allow the brass piece to dry thoroughly before touching.",
        "After the lacquer is dry, wipe the brass with a clean cloth to give it some shine.",
        "Cleaning Plated Brass Objects Determine if the piece is brass or brass-plated.",
        "It could be hard to differentiate if a brass piece is actual brass, or brass-plated.",
        "Hold a magnet near the brass piece and see if it's magnetically attracted to the brass.",
        "If the magnet does not stick, you are most likely handling brass.",
        "If the magnet does stick, it's likely that your \u201cbrass\u201d piece is actually a brass-plated piece of iron or steel.",
        "An alternative way to check if your piece is brass or brass-plated, is to use a sharp kitchen knife and scratch an inconspicuous part of the item.",
        "If the item is brass, the color in the scratch should be bright yellow.",
        "If the scratch mark is another color, like silver, then it is definitely another metal, and you still need to stick with non-abrasive cleaners so you don't remove the brass plating.",
        "Clean your lacquered brass-plated piece.",
        "Clean the entire brass-plated surface with a mixture of mild soap and cold to lukewarm water.",
        "Dip a cloth into the soapy water, wring out the cloth so it's only slightly damp, and gently rub the surface of the brass piece.",
        "Never try to polish lacquered brass.",
        "The polish tends to turn the surface of the brass piece cloudy.",
        "Don't use cleaners containing ammonia on lacquered brass pieces, because the ammonia will break down the protective lacquer.",
        "Clean your un-lacquered brass-plated piece.",
        "Dip a soft cotton cloth into a mixture of mild dish detergent and lukewarm water, wring out the cloth so it is only slightly damp, and gently wipe the surface of the brass piece clean.",

        "Rinse and apply a mild polish.",
        "Rinse the brass piece with water, and dry it completely using a clean cloth.",
        "Polishing brass-plated items can potentially remove some of the brass plating.",
        "If you plan to polish your brass-plated object, do so very gently.",
        "It may be helpful to test the polish on an inconspicuous area of your brass-plated item before you polish the entire piece."
