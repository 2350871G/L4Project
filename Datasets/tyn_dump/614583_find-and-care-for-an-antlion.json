Antlions spin a cocoon under the sand in order to become an adult. This stage will last approximately 3 weeks. When antlions emerge as an adult, they will have wings. Make sure you have prepared their environment so they cannot fly away and have somewhere to perch. Cover the habitat with a ventilated lid or net so the adult antlion won\u2019t escape.
