The one caveat here is that you cannot apply the latex over someone\u2019s skin. The latex will seal the skin from the air and cause damage to the skin. Clean and dry the item you wish to duplicate. Dirt, dust, and other contaminants can interfere with your mold. Clean the item with an appropriate cleaner such as soap and water (this may vary from item to item). Before creating the mold, make sure that you dry the object or allow it time to air dry. Set the item on a surface to act as a flange. Choose a flat, wide work surface. This will allow you to apply your mold beyond the edge of the object you wish to capture and form an outer flange. This flange will be useful when you are filling your mold in the future. Coating with latex Brush on a thin layer of liquid latex. Go a couple centimeters past the items edge to create a flange. This first layer will be the mold surface so ensure that there are no air bubbles. Allow this layer to dry for about 30 minutes. Brush on more layers of latex. Allow each layer to dry before applying the next. More layers of latex will yield a stronger mold. For very small items, four or five layers may be sufficient.
