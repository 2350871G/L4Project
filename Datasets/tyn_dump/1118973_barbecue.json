                    "description": "A charcoal grill requires coals to be lit in order to begin grilling, which can be done using a fire starter and a long match. Wait for the charcoal to heat up for about 20 minutes before starting to cook. When you're done with the charcoal grill, close the lid and let the coals cool down naturally before emptying the ashes. Charcoal grills get hotter and impart a more natural flavor, but they're more difficult to clean and keep at a constant temperature."

The gas grill has controls that you can easily turn on and off to light the grill, as well as control the temperature and placement of the fire.
