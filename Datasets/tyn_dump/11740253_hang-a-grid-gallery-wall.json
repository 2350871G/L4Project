For example, you can use 9 images to make a 3 by 3 grid, or 8 images to make a 4 by 2 grid. You cannot use 3, 7, or 11 images though since they cannot be arranged in an even grid. It is possible to create a grid wall with differently-sized pieces of art if you get oversized frames that match, but this generally doesn\u2019t look as good or uniform. A grid gallery wall can be 2 by 2, 4 by 4, or 6 by 6 if you\u2019re looking for a perfect square. You can also make a horizontal or vertical grid that is 2 by 3, 2 by 4, or 2 by 6. Vertical grids are great for columns and small walls, while horizontal grids do well on larger walls."

The goal of a grid gallery wall is to create a symmetrical and even look, which is hard to achieve if all of your frames are different. Choose a style of frame that looks good to you. Remove the backing on each frame to install the images in their frames.Warning: The size on a frame\u2019s label refers to the size of the art that fits inside the frame, not the overall size of the frame itself. In other words, a 9 by 11 in (23 by 28 cm) piece of art will fit in any frame that has 9 by 11 in (23 by 28 cm) on the label, although every 9 by 11 in (23 by 28 cm)  frame will not be the same size. You don\u2019t have to frame the art if you don\u2019t want to, but framed art and photography always looks cleaner.
