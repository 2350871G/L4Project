For example, if your pile of 26 cards has 10 red cards, then the remaining 16 cards must be black. Therefore, the spectator's pile of 26 cards MUST contain the remainder of 16 red cards (to your 10 red cards) and a remainder of 10 black cards (to your 16 black cards). So, as can be seen, the number of red cards in your pile (10) equals the number of black cards (10) in the spectator's pile.

Pile A always equals pile B in terms of red and black cards."
