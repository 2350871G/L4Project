    "text": " Wallpapering Corners Measure the distance between the edge of the last sheet of wallpaper and the corner. Measure in several places, including the top and bottom edges, keeping in mind that most corners aren't perfectly square. Cut your sheet to be 1/2 inch (2 cm) wider than your widest measurement. Hang the sheet, smooth it with the wallpaper brush, and carefully press it into the corner, being careful not to tear the paper.  Use a plumb bob at a distance of 1 inch (3 cm) less than the width of your wallpaper on the wall on the other side of the corner. Hang this sheet, carefully pressing it into the corner on top of the first sheet. Notice that the amount of overlap will vary slightly because the corner isn't perfectly square. Cut through both sheets at the corner with your wallpaper knife. Discard the part from your second sheet that overlaps the corner. Lift the edge of the second sheet of wallpaper and pull out the overlap from your first sheet. Discard it. Press the edge down again, smooth and roll both sides of the corner with your seam roller.  Cutting Wallpaper Around Trim Hang the wallpaper, allowing it to overlap the trim. Smooth it with the wallpaper brush as best you can without pressing it to the edge of the trim. Cut the wallpaper to expose the window or door, leaving about 2 inches (5 cm) overlapping the trim.  Cut the paper at a 45-degree angle through the wallpaper at the corners of the trim. Your cut should follow the seam where the two pieces of trim were fitted together at the corner. Press the wallpaper into the edge of the trim on the side and top and cut away the excess with your wallpaper knife. Smooth the sheet, then roll the edges with the seam roller. Hang the next sheet. For a door, measure the distance from the frame to the ceiling and cut the sheet so it overlaps the trim as before. For a window, if the sheet doesn't reach the other corner, cut two pieces and hang them separately. Take care to match the pattern with the adjoining sheet.",
