If you aren\u2019t used to singing out loud, record yourself as you play a note on your instrument and then try to match your voice to it. Slide up or down on the scale until you can locate the note with your singing voice. Continue to do this with several other notes.

Test your ear training by playing a note and then trying to sing it correctly. String several notes or sections of the song together and then try to play and sing it at the same time as one consistent melody.

Avoid songs with inconsistent melodies, such as rap and hip hop tracks. Listen closely for patterns in the song. In music, notes combine in a specific way to make a scale or chord, and chords come together to form chord progressions. Chord progression patterns are especially common in popular music, so you should be able to recognize common patterns when you hear them.

This will help you find the key of the song. To find the key of the song, you must first find the tonic or the root note, which is the first and last note in the scale of the song. For example, in the key of C Major, the tonic is C. The notes in a scale or key are like a family, so they are related and center around the tonic of the key. The tonic or the root note of the song will be the tone that sounds the most \u2018at home\u2019 in the song. It will sound like it could fit just about anywhere in the song. Determine the melody of the song. Now that you\u2019ve found the key of the song, try to find the melody based on the notes in the key. For example, in the key of C, the notes are C,D,E,F,G,A,B,C, so the melody will fall within these notes. Play a tone a fifth above the tonic to determine the chord progression of the song. In general, the notes of scales and chords are assigned specific numbers. So, the fifth is a fifth note of the scale. If we use \u2018La Bamba\u2019 as an example, it is in the key of C major.
