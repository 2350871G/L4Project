                    "description": "An assumed name is a business name that is not the legal name of the business or organization. It's also known a \"trade name\" or \"fictitious business name.\" A business cannot be sued under its assumed name because the assumed name does not create a legal entity. It simply is a named assumed by an existing legal entity. Therefore, while your business can operate using a registered assumed name, it must use its legal name for any legal transactions, including signing contracts or leases and buying inventory."

An assumed name lets you  present your business to the public using a different name than the one listed on your name registration. More than one business can have the same assumed name registered in Texas.

With an assumed name, you'll still be able to present the name you want to the public. Franchising is another common reason for getting an assumed name. For example, if \u201cLexus\u201d was opening a branch in Texas, the registered legal name would simply be \u201cLexus.\u201d However, the particular franchisee may want to use the assumed name \u201cLexus of Houston\u201d in the community."
