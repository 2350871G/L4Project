The one to the left should be higher and the one to the right should be lower. Now you should have 4 circles. Again, at each end, draw two more ovals, one lower and the other higher- right and left respectively. Those will be Arceus's legs. Draw the legs at the right of Arceus's body, just like the other two legs.  Draw long triangles at each end of the legs you drew. These will be the hooves. At the right end of the circle you drew, draw the tail. It will be a wave. Add another layer of wave. It also has a golden cross-like wheel attached to its body by its round abdomen. Instead, draw a bow around the abdomen. Alter the shape by drawing two triangles at either end of each bow edge.  Add in 4 jewels at each end where the two triangles meet.  Drawing Arceus' Head and Neck Draw the basic guidelines: Draw a rectangle at the top- left of the circles you drew. This will be the neck. Draw another rectangle inside the bottom- left of the rectangle that you drew.  Attach 2 triangles around the two sides of the bigger rectangle.  At the top-right, draw a circle. That will be the head. Draw two waves on the right of the circle. One should be at least apart from each other so you can fit in the facial features. Add in another wave, this time in the middle of the other two.  Add two long triangles. They will be the ears. Draw a long oval at the tip of the circle you drew.  Add in the eye, mouth and cheek.  Adding Detail Add in the details. They will be altering the shapes of the circles and triangles you drew. Outline the drawing. Erase all the sketch lines afterward. Feel free to curve lines, thin them down, etc. (It takes a little while to get a drawing perfect, but it's always worth the effort in the end.)
