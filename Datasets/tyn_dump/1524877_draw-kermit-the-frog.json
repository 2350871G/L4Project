Draw Kermit's body. Start by drawing a large oval shape and sketching a vertical guideline. Draw Kermit's arms. Sketch long rectangular shapes in the shape of the letter \u201cV\u201d for his right arm and an angled rectangle for his left arm. Draw Kermit's legs. Sketch long rectangular shapes in shape of the letter \u201cL\u201d, connecting them to his oval shaped body. These will be the limbs. Draw Kermit's hands and feet. He usually has long and thin hands and four pointy toes. Draw the details of Kermit's face and his collar. Create his eyes by drawing two half circles and then a circle in the middle of a tubular shape. For his collar, draw bold zigzag lines. Do a little bit of cleaning on your drawing by erasing some of the inside lines to remove joins that shouldn't be there. Then, connect any remaining drawn shapes to allow Kermit\u2019s body and form to emerge. Add some lines on his neck, fingers for his hands and a grin to his face to complete your drawing.  Outline your drawing. Outline by using a black pen or by sketching thick lines. Erase any outstanding lines not already tidied out of the picture. Color Kermit green! Use different shades of green for his body and different shades of red for his mouth. You may wish to experiment a little with the green shading to find a perfect color. You should experiment with light and dark shading to make Kermit look more 3D (three dimensional). Be sure to use a lighter green for the collar.",
