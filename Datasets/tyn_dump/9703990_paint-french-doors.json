You can leave it longer to ensure it dries, but paint as soon as possible to limit the amount of dust settling on the doors. If dust settles on the door, wipe it off with a dry cloth before painting. Applying the Paint Use an angled brush to paint difficult spots. Dip the brush into the paint, then use it to reach spots a paint roller can't get. It's perfect for covering the door's corners and the ridges around the windows. Tackle these difficult spots first since the paint bunches there.
