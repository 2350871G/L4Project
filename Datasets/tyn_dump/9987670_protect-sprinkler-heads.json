Measure straight across the top of the sprinkler head to determine how large of a sprinkler donut you need to purchase. You\u2019ll need a sprinkler donut with at least \u20442 inch (13 mm) of extra space on each side. Purchase sprinkler donuts for each sprinkler in your lawn. Sprinkler donuts wrap around your sprinkler heads when they are inactive as an added layer of protection. They are made of various materials, like plastic or concrete. Find a donut the right size for your sprinkler heads. Sprinkler donuts can be purchased at any lawn care store or online. Lightweight materials like plastic will float away after heavy rains. Place the donut over the sprinkler so it\u2019s in the center. Line up the sprinkler head so it is in the hole at the center of the donut. Put the donut on the ground and push it down with your foot to keep it in place firmly. Cut 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm) deep around the donut with a spade.

Since you cut along the edges of the donut, there should not be extra space that you need to fill in after you install the donut. Trimming Grass around the Sprinkler Place flags in the ground where there are sprinklers. Keeping flags in the area where your sprinklers are will remind you to use extra caution as you trim or mow around the area. Plastic yard flags can be purchased at any hardware or lawn care store. Mow over the donut as normal. Since the donut surrounds the sprinkler and it is flush with the grass, there should be no problem running a mower over the area. Be mindful of where the tires are when you mow the lawn so they do not run over an unprotected sprinkler. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable mowing over a sprinkler, use a weed whacker instead. Clean grass cuttings from the donut after you mow. Unless you bag your grass clippings, there will be leftover cuttings in the center of the donut.

Sprinkler head trimmers come as a smaller handheld tool or as a long-handled tool. Either will work. An electric trimmer will work the most efficiently, but it will cost more money. Cleaning Your Sprinkler Heads Turn the sprinkler system off. Close the valve on your sprinkler system so there is no water flowing through. This may be done at either the control panel for your system or at the main pipeline. Unscrew the nozzle from the base. Turn the nozzle counterclockwise to loosen it from the base. Once it\u2019s removed, set it aside. Bring a paper towel or a rag with you when you clean to have an area to set aside the pieces. You don\u2019t want to lose your sprinkler components in the lawn. Remove the filter screen. The filter screen is a screw-shaped part of the sprinkler head that sits right underneath the nozzle. Simply pull the filter screen up and out of the sprinkler head. If it is dirty, there will be visible debris around it. Rinse off the screen in a clean bowl of water. Move the filter screen back and forth in a small bowl of water to remove the debris. You may have to rub it with a clean cloth or your fingers to clean it entirely. Don\u2019t use chemicals or cleaners. Residue may stick in the filter screen and then be sprayed across your lawn. A soft-bristled toothbrush can help clean your sprinkler heads. Flush out the debris in the system. Other debris may have gotten further into your sprinkler system, so turn it on before you attach the screen and nozzle again. Let the water flow for 1 to 2 minutes or until the water runs clear. If there is still debris, you may have to unscrew the base so anything remaining is rinsed out. Screw the sprinkler back together. Place the filter back into the base of the sprinkler and reattach the nozzle by turning it clockwise. Run your sprinkler system to see if the sprinkler head runs better. If not, you may need to clean further or replace the head.",
