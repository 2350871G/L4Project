Simply poke at least five small holes in the bottom of a milk jug. Then bury the bottom of the jug so soil covers all the holes. Fill the jug up with water through the jug's stem using your garden hose. Keep the cap on to prevent the water from evaporating. The water will slowly flow out of the holes and irrigate your plants\u2019 roots. Be careful not to harm your plants\u2019 root systems when you bury the jug. For larger plant beds, use one jug at least every three feet (one meter)."
