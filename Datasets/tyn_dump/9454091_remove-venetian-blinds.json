Pull the drawstring down and away from the blind with your hand so the blades go up and lock into place. Once the blades are all the way up, let go of the drawstring. Use a screwdriver to lift up the bracket on each side of the blind. Standard brackets have a piece that clips into place over the front-facing side of the blind. Starting with one of the brackets, wedge the tip of the screwdriver between the clipped piece and the blind. Then, pull the screwdriver away from the blind to release the clipped piece and open up the bracket. Repeat on the other bracket. Slide the blind out of the open brackets. Grab a hold of the blind with both of your hands and gently pull it toward you. Now that the brackets are lifted up, the blind should easily slide out and away from the window.

Removing Blinds with Spring-Loaded Brackets Pull the blind blades all the way up using the drawstring. Grab the drawstring and pull it down and away from the blinds. The blind blades should lift upward and lock into place at the top of the window. Locate one of the spring-loaded brackets holding up the blind. The brackets should look like small metal squares resting on the top of the blind. They\u2019ll be sandwiched between the blind and the window frame. If you\u2019re having trouble locating one, look toward the ends of the blinds. Release the bracket by pushing the blind in and rotating it down toward you. Place both hands on the blind, one on each side of the bracket. Push in toward the window using your hands. Then, rotate the top of the blind down toward you so it releases from the bracket.
