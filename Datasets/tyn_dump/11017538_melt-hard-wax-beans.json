        "If your bowl starts to shake or rattle, too much steam is building up beneath it.",
        "Turn down the heat even more.",
        "Don't lift off the bowl, or your hands and face may get blasted by scalding hot steam.",
        "Remove the pot from the heat for a few minutes if necessary.",
        "Turn off the heat when your thermometer reads 150 \u00b0F (66 \u00b0C).",
        "Stick a heat-resistant thermometer into the melted wax, making sure not to touch the bottom or sides of the bowl.",
        "The wax temperature will continue to rise for a few minutes after you turn off the heat, so don't let it get all the way up to 160 \u00b0F (71 \u00b0C), or it may be too hot when you try to apply it.",
        "The ideal temperature range for hard wax used on your body is 125\u2013160 \u00b0F (52\u201371 \u00b0C).",
        "Wax that's over 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C) can cause burns.",
        "Leave the wax in the bowl, and leave the bowl on top of the pot.",
        "The residual heat will help keep it above 125 \u00b0F (52 \u00b0C) longer.",
        "If the wax starts to get too goopy to apply easily, turn the heat back on to low until the wax reaches 150 \u00b0F (66 \u00b0C) again.",
        "Melting Wax in the Microwave Pour the wax beans into a microwave-safe glass or bowl.",
        "A heat-resistant glass mixing bowl is probably your best option here.",
        "Make sure the bowl is large enough so that you don't have to fill it more than halfway with hard wax beans.",
        "Use your bean package for guidance on how much to use.",
        "You'll probably need around 24 oz (680 g) to wax one of your legs.",
        "Set your microwave power setting to 20 percent.",
        "At full power, the microwave will melt the wax unevenly, causing some spots to be dangerously hot while others aren't melted at all.",
        "Setting your microwave lower will help to heat the wax more slowly and evenly.",
        "Superheated wax could spontaneously erupt when you go to stir it, which could cause serious burns.",
        "Heat wax in the microwave very slowly and very carefully.",
        "Check your user's manual for guidance on reducing the power level on your microwave.",
        "Heat the wax for 10 seconds, then stir it.",
        "After only 10 seconds, the wax beans will look like they haven't melted at all.",
        "However, once you begin to stir them, you'll see that they're beginning to lose their shape.",
        "Stirring helps to ensure that the wax beans are heating and melting evenly, so don't skip this step!",
        "Use an oven mitt or towel to grab the bowl\u2014it may be very hot!",
        "Use a silicone spatula, wooden spoon, or wooden wax applicator stick to stir the wax.",
        "Repeat the process in 10-second increments until the wax is melted.",
        "Pop the bowl back into the microwave for 10 more seconds, and make sure it's still set at 20% power.",
        "Stir the bowl again.",
        "Once the wax seems evenly melted after stirring, use a heat-resistant thermometer to check it\u2014it should be between 125\u2013160 \u00b0F (52\u201371 \u00b0C) for use on your body.",
        "Do not use the wax if it is over 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C), or you may burn your skin.",
        "Melting times vary based on your microwave and the amount of beans you're melting, but it probably won't take more than 6 rounds of 10-second heating increments.",
        "Reheat the wax as needed when it starts to congeal.",
        "While a microwave is the quickest way to melt hard wax beans, it provides little residual heat to keep them at the ideal temperature.",
        "Within a few minutes, the wax will drop below 125 \u00b0F (52 \u00b0C) and start to get too clumpy to apply to your skin.",
        "When this happens, pop it back into the microwave for 10-second increments as before.",
        "Make sure the microwave is still set at 20% power."
