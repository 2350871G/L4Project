Air assist spray paint machines are used by woodworkers and automobile painters because they leave the best finish. They are the most expensive type of spray paint machine, however. Hand-held electric cup machines are often purchased by homeowners for small jobs, but can be difficult to use. They require that the paint be thinned significantly, and can clog or spit paint."

Keep your wrist stiff and move the sprayer in sweeping motions with your arm. To paint horizontal surfaces, such as ceilings, use a tip extension to redirect the paint. Spray from left to right (or right to left if you're left-handed), pressing the trigger on the sprayer just before you arrive at the point where you want to lay down paint. Lay down about 3 feet (1 meter) of paint at a time. Overlap the next application over your first by 50 percent so the surface will get 2 thin coats and won't dry into stripes of paint."
