Decorating the Cake Fill the cake with the white frosting. Place one of the cakes onto a plate, and coat the top with your white frosting.

        "This will set the crumb coat.",
        "During this time, it would be a good idea to refrigerate the piping bags with the rest of the frosting as well to keep it from turning too soft.",
        "Pipe a blob shape onto the side of the cake.",
        "Once the crumb coat has set, take the cake and the piping bags out of the fridge.",
        "Choose a color to start with, then outline your first blob.",
        "It should look like a warped circle or oval with wavy lines.",
        "Fill the blob in using the same.",
        "Move the pipe back-and-forth in a zigzag motion as you fill the entire blob in.",
        "Make sure that the filling is touching the outline.",
        "Keep the filling frost level with the outline; don't let it bunch up.",
        "Outline and fill more blobs onto the cake.",
        "Finish the sides first, then do the top.",
        "Switch colors as you work.",
        "Don't let two blobs of the same color touch\u2014not even in the corners.",
        "If you are having trouble making the blob shapes look random, try drawing them with your opposite hand.",
        "Let the frosting set for 3 to 5 minutes.",
        "Do not rush on ahead; otherwise, the frosting will stick to whatever you are using to smooth it with.",
        "You can test the frosting for doneness by touching it lightly with your finger\u2014it shouldn't stick to your finger.",
        "Iron the blobs out using a paper towel and fondant smoother.",
        "Choose a smooth-textured paper towel, and place it against the side of the cake.",
        "Run your fondant smoother across the paper towel using small, circular motions.",
        "Work in patches, starting from the sides and finishing with the top.",
        "You can also use a high-density foam roller, just make sure that it is clean!",
        "Pipe the rest of the frosting onto the edges, if desired.",
        "Fit a piping bag with a large, star-shaped tip.",
        "Squeeze the remaining frosting into the bag, alternating colors.",
        "Twist the bag shut, then pipe your multi-colored frosting onto the edges of the cake.",
        "For a simpler design, choose a color for the border, then switch the tip out for a large, star-shaped tip instead."
