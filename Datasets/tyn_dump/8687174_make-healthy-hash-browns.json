Toss the mixture well to make sure all of the potatoes are coated with the seasonings. You can add any other seasonings, such as garlic powder, paprika, and/or cayenne pepper, that you might like to the hash browns. Place a biscuit cutter on the baking sheet and fill with the potato mixture. When you're ready to make the hash brown patties, set a 3-inch (8-cm) biscuit cutter on the prepared baking sheet. Fill the cutter with \u00bd cup (115 g) of the potato mixture to form a patty. While you want a neat pile of the potato mixture to create the potato, don't press on the potatoes to pack them.
