Look for behavioral changes along with changes in appearance. If a frog becomes more lethargic or shows changes in its eating or waste production habits, there's a good chance something is wrong.

Add substrate and maintain the heat and humidity levels as you do with the main terrarium. This temporary home helps the frogs adjust to a new setting, and gives you time to make sure they are healthy and disease-free. Observe the frogs' appearance and habits for signs of trouble. Frog skin can reveal quite a bit about the animal's health. If a poison dart frog develops new spotting or color patterns along with increased mucus production from the skin, it may have absorbed a toxin. Discoloration--especially reddening--of lighter-colored areas of the skin, such as the legs or abdomen, may also indicate a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection. Look for behavioral changes along with changes in appearance. If a frog becomes more lethargic or shows changes in its eating or waste production habits, there's a good chance something is wrong. If you suspect any type of illness in a frog, keep it isolated and contact a reptile veterinarian for guidance. Some amphibian infections can be treated, while others are nearly always fatal. Care for the frogs separately for 6 weeks before relocating them. Care for the separate juveniles in the same way you care for any adults you already have. Feed them daily, keep a close eye on the humidity and temperature, and don\u2019t touch or bother them unless you really have to. Just enjoy watching them grow! After 6 weeks, you can pick them up and put them in the main terrarium. If the existing frogs don\u2019t accept their new roommates within a few days\u2014that is, they are territorial and aggressive towards them\u2014you may need to set up separate terrariums.",

        " Setting Up a Warm, Humid Terrarium Choose at least a 10 US gal (38 L) tank for 1-2 frogs.",
        "You need to provide a safe, relatively large space for these frogs to feel at home in.",
        "A 10 US gal (38 L) tank is a good size for 1-2 frogs.",
        "For every additional frog, add 10 US gal (38 L) to the tank size.",
        "You can use a fish tank, but replace a screen lid with a glass or plastic one.",
        "This traps in the humidity that the frogs need to thrive.",
        "Some frogs do better living alone, while others prefer company.",
        "If you\u2019re new to keeping poison dart frogs, start with 1 or 2.",
        "Add a substrate that holds moisture without ponding.",
        "To help trap humidity in the tank, start by adding a 2 in (5.1 cm) bottom layer of natural aquarium pebbles.",
        "Then, add a water-permeable substrate barrier cloth, followed by 2 in (5.1 cm) of sphagnum moss or coconut fiber.",
        "Scatter some dried leaves over the top.",
        "If water builds up in the pebbles, you can use a turkey baster to suck it up from the corners.",
        "The top layers of substrate (above the pebbles) will need to be replaced every 4-6 months, or when you notice a foul odor or mold growth.",
        "If maintaining the proper humidity isn\u2019t a problem, you can simplify the substrate by using just natural aquarium pebbles and dried leaves.",
        "Install plants and hiding spots.",
        "Once you lay the substrate, it helps the frogs feel more at home if you add plants.",
        "The plants will grow into the moss or coconut fiber and help keep the terrarium humid.",
        "When choosing which plants to add, keep in mind they need to be rainforest native and able to handle high levels of humidity.",
        "Bromeliads and orchids are examples of plants that will thrive in this setting.",
        "You can add fake plants as well, but these won't help with maintaining the humidity.",
        "Provide hiding spots where the frogs can go at night or when they want to be reclusive.",
        "The leaves you add on top of the soil can serve this purpose, but you can also add plastic, dome shaped \u201chides\u201d and sections of cork bark.",
        "Provide daytime lighting that doesn\u2019t heat the tank.",
        "Obtain a UV light to set on top of the tank, not a heat lamp.",
        "A heat lamp will dry out the air, and tank temperatures above 85 \u00b0F (29 \u00b0C) may harm the frogs.",
        "Turn the light on during the day, and off at night.",
        "The UV light is beneficial for the growth of both the plants and the frogs.",
        "It also allows you to spot any buildup of mold easier, along with more lighting for you to view your beautiful new terrarium and frogs!",
        "Add a hygrometer to track humidity, and a water bowl (if needed) to increase humidity.",
        "Poison dart frogs are very sensitive to the humidity level.",
        "It should remain at or above 80% at all times.",
        "Install a hygrometer (which measures relative humidity) so that you can keep a close eye on the moisture content inside the enclosure.",
        "If you keep the lid on at all times (except for during feedings) and mist the tank regularly with water (as described in this article), the humidity level should remain high enough.",
        "For an additional humidity boost, add a low-sided bowl to the terrarium and fill it with 0.5\u20131 in (1.3\u20132.5 cm) of dechlorinated water daily.",
        "Frogs don\u2019t need drinking water, as they absorb moisture through their skin, but they may soak in this dish from time to time!",
        "Track the temperature with a thermometer, and use a heating pad if necessary.",
        "As with humidity, poison dart frogs are quite sensitive to air temperature.",
        "The temperature inside the enclosure should stay between 74\u201382 \u00b0F (23\u201328 \u00b0C) during the day and 65\u201370 \u00b0F (18\u201321 \u00b0C) at night.",
        "If you need help maintaining this temperature in the terrarium, buy one or more plug-in aquarium heating pads to affix to the outer back or side walls.",
        "Mist the terrarium daily with dechlorinated water.",
        "Spraying the tank regularly increases the humidity and recreates a rainforest habitat for the frogs.",
        "Use distilled water or add dechlorinating drops to tap water\u2014frogs in general are sensitive to chlorine.",
        "Fill an empty spray bottle with the water and mist the whole tank thoroughly, 1-2 times per day (or more) depending on what is needed to maintain the humidity level.",
        "Choose a sprayer that creates a fine mist, not a heavy spray.",
        "The water will support any plants you\u2019ve added to the terrarium as well.",
        "Release springtails or isopods into the substrate soil, if desired.",
        "Springtails are classified as hexapods and isopods are classified as crustaceans.",
        "These tiny critters will help clean bacteria and stool out of the soil, keeping it cleaner for longer.",
        "Most of the time they will form a culture (that is, reproduce on their own) but the frogs will also eat them as snacks.",
        "This is an optional step.",
        "The frogs will get their main source of nutrition from the feedings of live insects you need to provide.",
        "You can get live springtails and isopods delivered to you from a feeder insect retailer, or you may find them at an exotic pet retailer.",
        "Clean the enclosure every 4-6 months, or when needed.",
        "Start by moving the frogs to a temporary enclosure.",
        "Then, empty out the tank and wash down the walls with a mild soap and dechlorinated water; do the same with any hiding spots, plastic plants, etc.",
        "Rinse these with dechlorinated water and dry them.",
        "Replace the substrate with fresh material.",
        "Once the enclosure is returned to its ideal state, you can put the frogs back in.",
        "If you notice mold or mildew building up inside the enclosure, or if it develops a foul odor, give it a good cleaning as soon as possible.",
        "Feeding the Frogs Obtain live, flightless fruit flies or other insects for feeding.",
        "Poison dart frogs eat a large variety of insects in their natural habitat.",
        "In captivity, flightless, live fruit flies should be their main diet, as they are relatively easy to obtain at pet shops or online.",
        "You can use isopods, small crickets, and even different types of tiny beetles, but flightless fruit flies tend to be the easiest option.",
        "If you want to feed the frogs live crickets, order \u201cpin-head\u201d or \u201c\u215b inch\u201d (0.3 cm) crickets (the 2 smallest categories) from a feeder insect retailer.",
        "The frogs will manage fine on a diet made up only of fruit flies, but you can add in other options every week or so to provide variety, if desired.",
        "With some patience and practice, you can learn to culture (that is, raise) flightless fruit flies yourself, so you don\u2019t need to keep buying them.",
        "Talk to an exotic pet store owner or someone else who is knowledgeable on the subject.",
        "Add nutrients to the insects, then release them into the tank.",
        "Add the needed amount of flightless fruit flies (or alternative) to a dish, then sprinkle an amphibian nutrient powder (available from exotic pet retailers) over them as directed.",
        "This will add additional, beneficial nutrients like calcium.",
        "Then, open the terrarium\u2019s lid, dump the critters onto the substrate, and close the lid again.",
        "The frogs will likely begin feeding immediately.",
        "Each juvenile frog typically eats 30 flightless fruit flies at a time, while an adult usually eats 50-75.",
        "Use this as a starting point\u2014if a frog finishes that amount in 5-10 minutes, increase it by half or so; if they don\u2019t finish within 15 minutes, reduce the amount a little.",
        "Feed juvenile frogs, and possibly adults, daily.",
        "Poison dart frogs are day feeders, so feed them on a fairly consistent schedule during the daytime.",
        "Juvenile frogs (less than 6 months old) should always be fed daily, while some adults may manage fine being fed 3-5 times per week.",
        "For adults, use their eating habits to establish their feeding schedule.",
        "If they eat well daily and appear healthy, maintain the daily schedule.",
        "If you don\u2019t feed daily, still open the lid briefly and close it again once per day.",
        "This provides enough fresh air without letting too much humidity escape.",
        "Handling the Frogs When Necessary Do not try to play with them.",
        "Unlike other exotic pets, such as reptiles or tarantulas, you should not try to hold poison dart frogs unnecessarily.",
        "They are very small and sensitive, so they should be kept inside their tank as much as possible.",
        "If you are looking for a playful, interactive pet these aren\u2019t the amphibians for you.",
        "They are more of a \u201cmuseum pet,\u201d which means they should be left alone and just observed.",
        "Don\u2019t be discouraged, though\u2014this doesn\u2019t make owning them any less fun.",
        "They are very active, especially during feeding time!",
        "Handle poison dart frogs only when you must move them.",
        "You should only handle  them when you are remodeling  or cleaning their tank, or when moving them to another tank.",
        "When you do so, place your thumb on the back of the frog\u2019s neck and use your fingers to scoop it up into a loose but secure grasp.",
        "Temporarily move them to a container that is set up similarly to their main terrarium and at least 12 in \u00d7 12 in (30 cm \u00d7 30 cm) in size.",
        "If they\u2019ll be in the temporary home for more than a few hours, you\u2019ll need to make sure the humidity and temperature are closely maintained.",
        "Wash your hands before and after handling the frogs.",
        "It\u2019s also a good idea to wear latex gloves.",
        "Although these frogs are not poisonous in captivity, there\u2019s a miniscule chance that their skin may still secrete a minute amount of poison.",
        "More importantly, though, you don\u2019t want to transfer any bacteria or chemicals (from hand creams, etc.)",
        "back and forth\u2014frogs absorb things readily through their skin and are very sensitive.",
        "Even healthy frogs can carry bacteria like salmonella, which can be particularly dangerous for children under 5 and other high-risk individuals.",
        "Young children should never handle any type of frog.",
        "Introducing New Poison Dart Frogs Acquire 1-2 captive-bred juvenile frogs from a reliable vendor.",
        "Any captive-bred poison dart frog will be non-poisonous, but you\u2019ll have a better chance of getting a healthy and happy frog from an established, reliable vendor.",
        "Ask friends who have exotic amphibians for referrals, or talk to owners of exotic pet stores in your area.",
        "Juvenile frogs (3-5 months of age) are easier to acclimate to a new setting than either babies or adults.",
        "In most cases, they\u2019ll be around 1 in (2.5 cm) long at this stage.",
        "There are many different species of poison dart frogs, and it\u2019s best to house ones from the same species together\u2014they\u2019ll be more similar in size and temperament.",
        "Set up a temporary home in a lidded, roomy container.",
        "For the first 6 weeks, the 1-2 juveniles you\u2019ve acquired should be kept separate from any other frogs.",
