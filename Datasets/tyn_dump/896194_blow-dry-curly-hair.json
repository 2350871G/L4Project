Do not aggressively rub the shampoo into your hair. Instead, let the water run through it, and gently massage your scalp. Buy a shampoo that is 100% sulfate- and alcohol-free. Sulfates create frizz, and alcohol dries your hair out. You can go 3 days without washing your hair if it is thick. Use dry shampoo in between washed if your hair looks or feels greasy."

Sprays are best for those with soft curls. Use thicker gels for medium to big curls. A thick gel should have a consistency similar to shampoo and be fairly easy to spread in your hands. Try dense gels for tight coils. A dense gel will probably be a bit sticky and more difficult spread. Don\u2019t use more than a dime-size portion of product.
