The patient is no longer short of breath, breathing rate has returned to normal, and the chest rises symmetrically upon air intake. X-rays (or other tests) show an absence of air or fluid in the pleural cavity. Explain the procedure to the patient. It is important that the patient understands what he will need to do during the procedure, such as the Valsalva maneuver. The patient may also be nervous about pain. They will remember the pain of insertion (if they were conscious), and chest tubes can also be quite painful while inserted. It will be important to reassure the patient, as the removal of a chest tube is usually less painful than going in. Position the patient in a semi-Fowler's position. Lay the patient on his back and elevate the head of the bed by a small amount (usually about 30). The patient's knees may be flat or may be elevated by a small amount. The patient's arms should be relaxed and out of the way. Wash your hands and put on gloves. Washing your hands and wearing gloves are critically important in reducing the chance of spreading diseases such as infection. Warning: Use latex-free gloves if the patent is allergic to latex. Put on an apron and face shield. This is done to protect yourself from any splatter or drainage, as removing a chest tube can be a messy procedure. A face shield consists of a clear, plastic panel that straps around the forehead and covers the face.

This is done to maintain a sterile environment, as the old gloves are contaminated from removing the dressing. Removing the Chest Tube Clamp the tube using a rubber-tipped Kelly clamp, and discontinue suction. This is to stop any air flow from entering or leaving the pleural space. The rubber tips help prevent damage to the chest tube. The Kelly clamp also locks itself in place using a gripping mechanism near the handles. Cut the anchor suture that holds the tube in place. Warning: Do not puncture or cut the chest tube. The change in air pressure could cause the lungs to collapse. Warning: Make sure to hold the chest tube in place after the anchor suture has been cut, as there is nothing left holding the tube in place. Warning: If present, do not cut the purse-string suture.
