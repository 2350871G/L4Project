When you\u2019re done, give the surface a few minutes to dry to the touch. Your wood surface needs to be free of dust, dirt, oil and other messes in order for the tung oil to set up properly. A good wipedown also serves to raise the wood grain, which makes sanding more effective and results in a smoother overall finish."

Mix 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of TSP into 1 gallon (3.8 l) of water and use a brush or sponge to spread the liquid over the entire surface. Avoid handling the surface until it\u2019s had time to dry. TSP is a highly-effective deep cleaner, but it\u2019s also highly toxic. Always make it a point to wear long-sleeved clothing, rubber gloves, and a respirator or facemask anytime you\u2019re working with the chemical. It\u2019s also a good idea to do your stripping in an area with good ventilation (or outside, if possible) to prevent the fumes from becoming overpowering."

This will smooth out imperfections and inconsistencies in the grain. Be sure to sand each and every part of the item you\u2019ll be finishing, including corners, edges, and recessed nooks. Sanding is necessary to help the first layer of tung oil settle into the wood."

The surface should be entirely free of debris before you begin applying the oil. If the wood is damp, allow it to dry to the touch before proceeding. Use a thin dry brush to coax stubborn particles out of creases and grooves. Any dust left behind may create imperfections in the finish."
