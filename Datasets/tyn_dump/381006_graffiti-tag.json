        "Blatant mimicry in finished tags (or \u201cbiting,\u201d as it\u2019s called in graffiti circles) is frowned upon.",
        "This is another reason why it\u2019s important to start out with a sketchbook.",
        "This way you can learn by others\u2019 examples without being accused of trying to pass off borrowed styles as your own.",
        "Practice your full tag.",
        "As you grow more satisfied with each letter on its own, start grouping them together to see how they look as a whole.",
        "You don\u2019t have to literally paint the whole tag in one unbroken move, but aim to suggest a fluid, graceful motion from one letter to the next.",
        "Continue tinkering with each letter as needed with an eye toward how it gels with the rest until you\u2019re satisfied with the full effect.",
        "For example:\nIf you\u2019re using the letters \u201cU\u201d and \u201cV,\u201d you may be pleased at first with how they each look individually.",
        "However, you may then realize that they\u2019re too similar and confusing when paired together.",
        "In this case, you\u2019ll have to alter one or both to make them more distinct so your tag is easily legible.",
        "Spraying Your Tag Practice first.",
        "Remember: practice makes perfect.",
        "Before you debut your tag for the world to see, start off with something that\u2019s for your eyes only.",
        "Grow accustomed to using spray-paint where you won\u2019t be embarrassed by any mistakes or mishaps.",
        "Use a canvas that you can practice on and repaint as needed without being arrested, such as:\nAn actual large canvas\nA sheet of plywood\nA wall that belongs to you Stretch beforehand.",
        "Keep in mind that you want your tag to appear fluid and dynamic, regardless of how small or large it is.",
        "At the same time, realize that you will often need to move quickly to keep your lines nice and neat.",
        "Avoid mistakes that could be caused by a stiff body, aches, and cramps.",
        "Limber up beforehand.",
        "Also keep in mind:\nThis goes for your whole body, not just your arms.",
        "Expect your waist, hips, legs, and feet to have an impact on the quality of your work.",
        "The larger the surface area to be covered, the wider your range of motion will need to be.",
        "A larger canvas means you have to reach, lean, and bend to a greater degree, and more often.",
        "Shake your can up.",
        "Expect the paint\u2019s ingredients to separate over time.",
        "Always give it a vigorous shake before you use it, even if you only set it aside for a few minutes.",
        "Check the directions on the can to see how long you should shake, both before its first use and (if mentioned) again after a short pause.",
        "If you don\u2019t shake it up, the consistency will be uneven.",
        "This means that it will be extremely thin at times (which makes for a weak coat), and thicker at others (which could cause clogs).",
        "Put your spraying cap on well away from your canvas.",
        "If you need to attach a separate spray cap to your can, expect this to release some paint as you do so.",
        "Stay away from your canvas so it doesn\u2019t get any spray-back.",
        "Place your finger (or better yet, a loose strip of tape) over the cap\u2019s nozzle to catch what comes out.",
        "Remember that many paints have toxic ingredients.",
        "Even those that don\u2019t should never be inhaled or ingested.",
        "Wear protective gloves and mask to reduce this risk.",
        "Experiment with distance.",
        "Before you try your hand at spraying your tag, start with simple lines sprayed from various distances.",
        "Judge the effect of how near or far you stand from your canvas.",
        "Expect a wider dispersal the farther back your stand.",
        "For neat, crisp lines, you need to work up close.",
        "For fades and shadows, you need more distance.",
        "Move quickly.",
        "Remember that the paint is going to dry immediately upon contact.",
        "Expect prolonged spraying over one area to result in a wet buildup.",
        "Avoid drips and runs by keeping the can in motion constantly, especially if you\u2019re aiming for very thin lines.",
        "Again, some experimentation may be needed here.",
        "Constant motion is always key, but do some practice lines at various speeds to see what effect each has on your lines.",
        "Another reason not to dawdle is if you decide to tag some place without permission.",
        "Be choosy about locations.",
        "Once you\u2019re confident in your spray-painting skills, decide where to apply them.",
        "Avoid the temptation to simply tag a surface on impulse.",
        "Think before you act.",
        "Things to consider include:\nWhether the area has already been tagged, in which case you should choose another.",
        "How visible it is, since you may be better off improving your skills on less visible areas.",
        "If it\u2019s legal to tag this space, and if so, whose permission you need to obtain, if any.",
        "If it\u2019s illegal to do so, and if so, if you\u2019ll be easily noticed or caught."
