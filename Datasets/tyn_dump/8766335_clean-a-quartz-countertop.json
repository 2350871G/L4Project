Generally, it\u2019s best to use a mild dish detergent that doesn\u2019t contain any astringents or harsh chemicals. These substances can wear down quartz with repeated use. The resins used to seal quartz make the finish resistant to everyday dust, dirt, stains and mold. Warm water is more effective for releasing resilient messes than cold water."

Use only flexible plastic scrapers (never metal) or nonabrasive sponges and be careful not to apply too much pressure. Doing so may create small scratches or abrasions that can worsen over time.

Combine equal parts vinegar and water in a spray bottle, mist the entire counter surface and run a soft kitchen sponge over it to leave behind a streak-free shine.
