People with vision problems often have different shaped eyeballs, cornea, or lens. This physical malformation prevents light from entering into the eye correctly and causes blurry vision.

Eye strains are caused by placing too much stress on the eye. Activities that cause eye strains include: driving, staring at computers/tv for long periods of time, reading etc. Pay attention to double vision. Double vision is seeing two images of one object. It can occur in one eye or both. Double vision can be caused by having an irregular shaped cornea, cataracts, or astigmatism. Look for light halos. A halo is a bright circle surrounded by a source of light, usually headlights. Halos typically occur in dark environments, for example at night or in dark rooms. A halo can be caused by nearsightedness, farsightedness, cataracts, astigmatism, or presbyopia. Notice if you are experiencing a glare. A glare is a source of light that enters your eye that does not improve vision. A glare typically occurs in the daytime. A glare can be caused by nearsightedness, farsightedness, cataracts, astigmatism, or presbyopia. Notice blurry vision.
