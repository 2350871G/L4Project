        "There are some classics, but you probably already have a go-to in mind.",
        "Use your words.",
        "Don\u2019t abbreviate everything.",
        "It can be misleading, confusing, and may even seem a bit childish.",
        "You can get away with \u201clol\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s practically a part of the English language \u2013 but don\u2019t send acronyms or abbreviations your recipient might not familiar with it.",
        "If you\u2019re interested in them, the least you can do is thumb out complete words.",
        "Relatedly, be aware that emoticons should not completely take the place of words.",
        "Cap your emoji-use.",
        "There is definitely, definitely such a thing as too many emoticons.",
        "Personal preference is a legitimate argument here, but don\u2019t forget to occasionally mention that you\u2019re interested in having a genuine conversation if they would too.",
        "Comedy is the only realm in which it is appropriate to overuse emoticons.",
        "In particular, feel free to indulge in storytelling with emoticons.",
        "If you can wind together a solid, ideally humorous narrative using only tiny 2D images, by all means, emoji-away.",
        "Even emoticons are getting raunchy these days.",
        "Hold off on the emoji innuendos until you have an appropriate relationship with someone who might appreciate your smiley face based sultriness.",
        "Maintaining Respect While Articulating Affection Take photos of the fun, unique activities you do.",
        "This can sometimes include photos of yourself, especially at impressive locations, doing interesting things, or when you have a pre-established understanding regarding photo exchanges.",
        "Or take photos of the random things or moments that remind you of your crush.",
        "Send these along, with a quick note to provide some context.",
        "Again, don\u2019t overthink it, just let your crush know you\u2019re thinking about them.",
        "For example, if you go on a hike and catch the sunset, send your favorite photo along with something like, \u201cHey!",
        "Check it out: another epic battle between the mighty sun and the steadfast horizon.",
        "Who\u2019s your money on?\u201d Limit the selfies.",
        "Sending photos via text can be an absolute blast, but they should convey something interesting or thoughtful.",
        "Don\u2019t pepper all your love interests with unsolicited, non-stop photos of yourself as soon as you get their number.",
        "Don\u2019t do it.",
        "Just\u2026 don\u2019t do it.",
        "If you are the selfie-taking type, that\u2019s great, but make sure the recipient of your selfies actually wants them before you send them.",
        "If they don\u2019t, you\u2019re probably just making it seem like you like taking photos of yourself.",
        "One way to tell if someone may be interested in receiving selfies is by examining their social media.",
        "If they\u2019re a big fan of selfies themselves, you\u2019ll be able to tell pretty quickly, and you can rest assured they probably feel that selfies are a legitimate way of presenting oneself.",
        "They might even be interested in seeing other people\u2019s selfies too.",
        "You should still make sure.",
        "Watch your mouth.",
        "The bravado facilitated by interacting with someone through a screen sometimes gives us the momentary courage to text someone we\u2019ve had a hard time convincing ourselves to talk to.",
        "This is great, because it can get the romantic ball rolling.",
        "That being said, communicating via text does not give you the liberty to say whatever you want.",
        "If it\u2019s not something you\u2019d say to someone in real life, don\u2019t say it via text.",
        "Maybe it\u2019s easier to ask your crush out on a date via text than in person \u2013 there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.",
        "If you do go this route, be respectful about it.",
        "Understand that they may rather have that type of conversation in person, especially if its someone you see frequently or already know.",
        "Don\u2019t be creepy.",
        "Don\u2019t risk comments that may be misunderstood.",
        "You may be intending humor, but texting off-color jokes like, \u201cyour bedroom looks good from your backyard\u201d is equally likely to elicit a restraining order as it is a response.",
        "Though you may be wondering about your crush\u2019s interest in going straight from texting to the bedroom, there are better ways to gauge someone\u2019s interest in you than making questionable comments.",
        "Hold off on the seduction attempts.",
        "If the person you\u2019re texting is at all interested in you, you\u2019ll have plenty of opportunities to tell them how fine they look or how much you\u2019d like to nibble on their ear.",
        "Even if you\u2019re just looking for a casual, predominantly physical relationship, you need to determine whether that\u2019s even a possibility before bursting in guns-a-blazing.",
        "It\u2019s poor form \u2013 both in terms of mature behavior and in terms of effectiveness in actually seducing someone \u2013 to immediately make sexual comments or implications of any type.",
        "Don\u2019t just booty text people.",
        "Texting people late at night is fine if you have an established relationship, but if you only tend to text someone later in the evening, they may feel as though you\u2019re only interested in one thing.",
        "Keep a firm grasp on reality.",
        "Sure, it can be fun to stare at your phone imagining what your crush is doing, but knowing that they\u2019re probably just re-reading your texts and that they\u2019ll respond any second now.",
        "It\u2019s also supremely exciting when you feel a buzz in your pocket and immediately assume it\u2019s definitely a witty response to your witty text and not just a weather update.",
        "If you become angry because someone has not responded, you need to sit down and do some serious reflection.",
        "Do not ever continue sending increasingly angrier text messages.",
        "Recognize that no one owes anybody a response to a text message.",
        "Similarly, don\u2019t be discouraged if you don\u2019t get a quick response.",
        "Your crush may be busy, or they may simply not feel like dealing with a cell phone for a while.",
        "Respect people enough to know that they have life outside of the realm of their pocket computer.",
        "Following Up on Successful Flirtation Say goodnight.",
        "\u201cSleep tight,\u201d might work, but a bit of creativity can go a long way here.",
        "It\u2019s intimate to text in the evening, as you may be the last person your crush interacts with before drifting off to sleep.",
        "\u201cSweet dreams,\u201d is also an old standby, but if you\u2019re feeling more forward, you can always go with \u201cTrying to fall asleep, but I can\u2019t stop thinking about you.\u201d Act on mutual interest.",
        "This is the simplest step of the article: actually go out with the person you\u2019re so hype about texting with.",
        "You\u2019re already standing on lava, why not dive into the volcano?",
        "After a few rounds of compliments and wisecracks, ask your crush if they\u2019d like to meet up.",
        "If nothing else, you\u2019ll have more to text about after a real world interaction.",
        "You\u2019ve got options.",
        "There\u2019s the tried and true, \u201cWhat are you up to tonight/ tomorrow night/ this weekend?\u201d The implied spontaneity of deciding to get together on a whim can make meeting seem more casual, and allows your crush the space to respond casually.",
        "Alternatively, asking \u201cCan you sneak away for coffee?\u201d adds the intrigue of the unexpected, and can get your crush thinking about you for the rest of the day even if they\u2019re unable to meet up.",
        "Be explicit.",
        "If you invite someone to hangout, specify what you have in mind.",
        "At least mention a place, a day, or an activity.",
        "You don\u2019t have to plan a whole date in one text, but you should at least accompany an invitation with an idea.",
        "Before a date, let your crush know you\u2019re excited.",
        "Be explicit.",
        "Try, \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to tonight.\u201d Reaffirm your admiration after an enjoyable date.",
        "The date went well?",
        "(I knew you could do it.)",
        "What did you talk about?",
        "Did your crush say something especially interesting, or tilt their head in a way that caught the streetlight just right?",
        "If so, mention it.",
        "Say things like\u2026 \u201cYou looked great tonight,\u201d but also mention more substantial aspects of your affection by saying things like, \u201cI really liked how you described ________.\u201d Follow up sensual encounters.",
        "So you\u2019ve spent an evening together.",
        "It went exactly how you\u2019d hoped, and you\u2019re hoping for more.",
        "You don\u2019t have to immediately start texting about sex positions or genitalia.",
        "Go more for reaffirmations of contentment and attraction.",
        "Here\u2019s a few examples: \u201cLast night was incredible,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about you all day,\u201d or \u201cIt really turned me on when you______.\u201d\nEven better: \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see you again,\u201d or \u201cI have a feeling our next date will be even better.\u201d\nDescribe the sensations you\u2019re feeling.",
        "You know they\u2019re into you.",
        "You\u2019re into them.",
        "It\u2019s time to text about it.",
        "Send a series of messages, with each one describing a different sensation you\u2019re feeling, or that they\u2019ve made you feel.",
        "Be creative, and reference the time you\u2019ve spent together and specific experiences you\u2019ve shared."
