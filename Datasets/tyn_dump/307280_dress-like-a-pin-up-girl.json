Curls were often achieved by a \u201cpermanent\u201d which made hair easier to mold into a curl, but you can achieve this look without chemicals. To get pin curls: dab gel onto the root of a small section of damp hair, then twirl that section of hair around your finger until you get to your scalp. (You can twirl in whatever direction you\u2019d like the curls to flow.) Slide your finger out of the curl and pin the curl to your head. Repeat for your entire head of hair, allow hair to dry, then remove pins, and voila! You can find many authentic vintage ways to style your pin curls online.
