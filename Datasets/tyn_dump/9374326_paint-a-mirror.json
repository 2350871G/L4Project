Start by dampening a microfiber cloth with water and wiping the surface to remove any dust. Use a separate microfiber cloth to thoroughly dry the surface. If your mirror is quite dirty, use a mild soap solution to wipe it down. Follow up with plain water, and then dry the surface with the cloth. To get rid of fingerprints and greasy residue, dip the cloth in a small amount of rubbing alcohol and wipe down the surface."

For example, if you are painting koi onto a mirror, don\u2019t paint the entire water backdrop blue. Leave a few unpainted areas in the water, which will create interesting effects once the painting is finished. If you are painting a portrait, sketch in the form of the person, but leave the backdrop unpainted.

For example, if you want to lighten any color, add a small amount of white paint. Use the knife to completely blend the two colors together. If you want it lighter, add more white and mix again. If you need to make brown paint, combine equal quantities of complementary colors. Complementary color pairings you can try: yellow and purple, green and red, or blue and orange."

        "Wipe down the surface of the frame to remove dust and debris.",
        "Before you start painting, thoroughly wipe down the surface of the mirror frame with a dampened microfiber cloth.",
        "If you don\u2019t do this, dust and debris on the frame\u2019s surface may show through the paint once you\u2019ve finished.",
        "Make sure the frame\u2019s surface is clean and dry before proceeding.",
        "If your frame was previously painted, it\u2019s completely fine to spray paint right over that.",
        "The only exception is if the paint is flaking or chipping.",
        "If it is, use a wire brush to remove the flakes, then sand the surface until it\u2019s smooth.",
        "Mask off the mirror and any areas that you don\u2019t want to spray paint.",
        "Use painter\u2019s tape to protect areas that you don\u2019t want to paint, such as the mirrored surface and any detail work on the frame that you want to preserve.",
        "For a large mirrored surface, cover it with heavy cardstock first, then secure the edges of the cardstock down with painter\u2019s tape.",
        "Apply the first coat of spray paint in short bursts.",
        "Hold your chosen color of spray paint about 12 in (30 cm) to 18 in (46 cm) away from the mirror frame for best results.",
        "Working systematically around the frame, apply a thin coat of spray paint using short, light bursts.",
        "Use a steady back-and-forth motion and slightly overlap each stroke with the next one.",
        "Allow the first coat of spray paint to dry for 1-2 hours.",
        "Don\u2019t try to cover the frame in one coat \u2013 this will likely lead to dripping and running.",
        "Do several thin coats.",
        "Apply another light coat of spray paint.",
        "Work systematically, just as you did before.",
        "Apply another coat of your chosen paint and allow it to dry for another 1-2 hours.",
        "If you feel it still needs another coat, go ahead and apply it.",
        "Always give the last coat time to dry before proceeding with the next one.",
        "Spray paint the backside of the frame, if desired.",
        "You don\u2019t have to do this, but many people prefer to.",
        "Once the front side is completely dry, flip the frame over and repeat the same technique to spray paint the back.",
        "Give each coat an hour to dry before applying another one.",
        "Wait 24 hours for the mirror frame to cure completely.",
        "Once all the spray paint coats have been applied, give the frame about 24 hours to fully cure.",
        "Remove the painter\u2019s tape and cardstock after 24 hours have passed.",
