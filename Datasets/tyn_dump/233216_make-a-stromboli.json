If you overwork the dough, it becomes harder to work with, the consistency becomes undesirable, and it won't raise properly. Lightly grease the bowl and the dough. If you don't, it'll dry out. Cover the dough with plastic wrap, set it on your counter, and let it rise for 1-2 hours. Try to use it as shortly after this period as possible -- it's freshest when recently risen. Pizza Stromboli Preheat the oven to 450\u00b0 Fahrenheit (232\u00b0 Celsius).  Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place in a medium-sized bowl. If it's been on the short side of two hours, check to see that it's adequately raised. Coat the dough with the olive oil. Recover it with the plastic wrap, and let it rest at room temperature for 15 minutes. It'll be a bit more manageable when it cools slightly. In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the tomatoes and their juices. Add the oregano and salt and bring to a boil. Stir it occasionally, thoroughly combining the spices. Reduce the heat in the saucepan and simmer. Crush the tomatoes with a wooden spoon until the sauce thickens. This should take about 10 to 15 minutes. Shape the dough into one 12-to-14-inch round and place on a baking sheet.

Grab a cookie sheet and spray it with nonstick cooking spray. If you'd prefer, line a sheet with parchment paper (no muss, no fuss, just throw it away after). Prep your ingredients. Chop up your bell pepper(s) and, if applicable, shred the mozzarella. Measure out your ingredients and set aside for swift assembly.

See the next section for possible folding methods. Once folded, if you'd like a golden color, whisk up an egg and brush it on the top just before baking.

Keep an eye on it and flip it halfway through, if necessary. Remove from the oven and let cool. Slice as you see fit. This recipe should serve 6. Rolling or Braiding For a roll, start with the thinnest strip of dough. You want the largest section of non-filled dough to be at the end of the roll.
