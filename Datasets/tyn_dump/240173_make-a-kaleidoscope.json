    "text": " Making an Easy Kaleidoscope with a Plastic Report Cover Draw an eight-by-four inch rectangle on a clear plastic report cover.This is going to be the base of your Kaleidoscope. Cut it out, using scissors. Draw three horizontal lines across the rectangle, splitting it into three 1 \u20444 inch (3.2 cm) pieces and one \u20444 inch (0.6 cm) piece. Note that you'll need to make it this size to fit your paper towel roll. To make these lines easier to fold later, you may wish to measure and trace these lines in marker first, then use a paper cutter or box cutter to lightly score these lines into the plastic. Do not cut completely through the plastic, however. Fold the plastic along the lines to form a triangular shape. The quarter-inch strip should stay on the outside and act as a flap. Tape the strip along the edge using transparent tape, so the triangle hold its shape. Slide the triangle into the cardboard and create your peephole. Cut a paper towel roll down to 8 inches, the same size as your triangle. Slide the plastic triangle into the paper towel roll. To create your peephole, turn the paper towel tube on one end, standing straight up. Trace a circle around it on black construction or contact paper. Then, poke a hole through the center of the circle, using scissors or a sharp pencil, and making it large enough so you can see through it. Tape the circle over one end of the tube. If you'd like, make the circle a little bit bigger. You can then cut tiny slits along the edges so the circle lies flat on the end. Then you have some wiggle room to work with and won't have tape on the visible part of your kaleidoscope. And if there is tape that's visible, you can always cover it in glitter. Cut out a four-inch square of plastic wrap. Place the square of plastic wrap over the other end of the tube. Use your fingers to poke it down into the plastic triangle, until it forms a little pouch. Fill the pouch with beads, sequins, and confetti. Anything small and shiny will do the trick, but translucent objects are best. You also want different shapes and sizes. Your kaleidoscope won't be shoved in a drawer anytime soon if there's infinite variations as to what can be seen! If this doesn't end up looking like you want it to look, you can always go back into your kaleidoscope and make adjustments! Place a square of waxed paper over the pouch. Place a four-inch square of waxed paper over the pouch and around the cardboard tube, sealing in the beads and sequins. Stretch a rubber band over both the waxed paper and the plastic wrap. Make sure it\u2019s on tight so nothing spills out! Trim the corners of the squares. This will make the kaleidoscope look neater. You can replace the rubber band with some sticky tape, if you like. Decorate the outside of your kaleidoscope. You can use stickers, wrapping paper, contact paper (just be diligent in bubble prevention! ), or construction paper. Some contact paper looks like wood, metal, or gold. But why stop at paper? You could add glitter or sequins on the outside, too! Use your kaleidoscope.

Can you recreate anything? Creating an Intermediate Kaleidoscope with Acrylic Mirror and Cardboard Cut the mirror into 3 strips that are 1 \u00bd\" wide. That's about 3.8 centimeter (1.5 in). The best kind of \"mirrors\" for this are acrylic -- or those cheap little locker mirrors they sell everywhere when it's back-to-school season. They're not really mirrors, so they're fairly easy to cut into with a box or paper cutter. Lay the 3 strips side by side and upside down. Be sure to leave a small gap between each strip. \"Small gap\" here means about 1/8\" (.3 cm). Then, tape the mirrors together (along the gaps), bend them into a triangle shape, and set aside. Cut your cardboard roll to the length of your mirror plus 1/3\" (.85 cm). This is easiest with a box cutter, but scissors will do. Just be careful not to stab yourself! Create your peephole. Here's how:\nPlace one of the circular ends of your tube flat on a piece of paper -- contact paper is best, but construction paper or even gift wrap will work, too.

Cut a piece of acrylic mirror into three 7 \u20448 inch (20.0 cm) by 1 \u20448 inch (2.9 cm) rectangles, using an operating table saw with a carbide-tip blade. Use a vacuum to clean any sawdust from the mirrors. Prepare the PVC pipe. Cut a white PVC pipe with a diameter of 1 \u20442 inches (3.8 cm) to a length of 7 \u20448 inches (20.0 cm) using a chop saw with a carbide tip-wood blade. Clean the tube to remove any dirt or debris. Prepare the end cap. Drill a \u20448 inch (1.0 cm) hole into the center of a 1 \u20442 inch (3.8 cm) PVC socket end cap. Wipe around the hole to remove any debris. Prepare the foam strips. Cut a strip of adhesive-backed foam into pieces about one inch long. You will need three pieces for the kaleidoscope. Prepare the foam rope. Get a piece of foam rope that's half an inch in diameter. Cut it into one inch pieces. You will need three of these for the kaleidoscope. Glue a petri dish to one end of the PVC tube. The petri dish should be 60 mm by 15 mm and should be made out of plastic. Use PVC cement to attach the petri dish to the tube, being careful not to get any cement on the dish. You can either leave the glass clear to create a \"world view\" kaleidoscope or you can create a colored kaleidoscope by drawing on the inside face of the petri dish using colored permanent markers before you attach it to the PVC tube. Assemble the mirrors. Gather the three mirrors, long sides together and gently fold them into a triangle with the shiny sides facing in. Make sure you have removed any protective film first. Neatly tape the mirrors together using transparent tape, so that the edges of the three mirrors form an equilateral triangle. Attach the foam strips to the mirrors. Remove the adhesive backing from the three pieces of foam and stick one piece on the side of each mirror, approximately one inch from the end. Place the mirrors inside the PVC tube. Gently insert the mirrors, foam end first, into the PVC tube. You may need to squeeze the foam to make it fit. Insert the three pieces of foam rope into the spaces between the mirrors and the tube. Close it up. Place the PVC end cap over the open end of the PVC tube, twist to secure tightly. Your kaleidoscope is now ready, enjoy the view!",

        "Use your fingers to poke it down into the plastic triangle, until it forms a little pouch.",
        "Fill the pouch with beads, sequins, and confetti.",
        "Anything small and shiny will do the trick, but translucent objects are best.",
        "You also want different shapes and sizes.",
        "Your kaleidoscope won't be shoved in a drawer anytime soon if there's infinite variations as to what can be seen!",
        "If this doesn't end up looking like you want it to look, you can always go back into your kaleidoscope and make adjustments!",
        "Place a square of waxed paper over the pouch.",
        "Place a four-inch square of waxed paper over the pouch and around the cardboard tube, sealing in the beads and sequins.",
        "Stretch a rubber band over both the waxed paper and the plastic wrap.",
        "Make sure it\u2019s on tight so nothing spills out!",
        "Trim the corners of the squares.",
        "This will make the kaleidoscope look neater.",
        "You can replace the rubber band with some sticky tape, if you like.",
        "Decorate the outside of your kaleidoscope.",
        "You can use stickers, wrapping paper, contact paper (just be diligent in bubble prevention!",
        "), or construction paper.",
        "Some contact paper looks like wood, metal, or gold.",
        "But why stop at paper?",
        "You could add glitter or sequins on the outside, too!",
        "Use your kaleidoscope.",
        "Hold the tube up to one eye, facing the light, and look through it.",
        "Turn it slowly -- what happens?",
        "It's your own light show!",
        "The light is bouncing back and forth against your report cover, creating this constantly changing display in front of your very eyes.",
        "Take it away from your eye for a second, give it a quick, gentle shake, and put it back up to your eye.",
        "Just how different is what you're seeing?",
        "What happens if you do it again?",
        "Can you recreate anything?",
        "Creating an Intermediate Kaleidoscope with Acrylic Mirror and Cardboard Cut the mirror into 3 strips that are 1 \u00bd\" wide.",
        "That's about 3.8 centimeter (1.5 in).",
        "The best kind of \"mirrors\" for this are acrylic -- or those cheap little locker mirrors they sell everywhere when it's back-to-school season.",
        "They're not really mirrors, so they're fairly easy to cut into with a box or paper cutter.",
        "Lay the 3 strips side by side and upside down.",
        "Be sure to leave a small gap between each strip.",
        "\"Small gap\" here means about 1/8\" (.3 cm).",
        "Then, tape the mirrors together (along the gaps), bend them into a triangle shape, and set aside.",
        "Cut your cardboard roll to the length of your mirror plus 1/3\" (.85 cm).",
        "This is easiest with a box cutter, but scissors will do.",
        "Just be careful not to stab yourself!",
        "Create your peephole.",
        "Here's how:\nPlace one of the circular ends of your tube flat on a piece of paper -- contact paper is best, but construction paper or even gift wrap will work, too.",
        "Cut about 1\" (2.5 cm) around the traced circle; with that extra 1\", cut little notches around the circle so it bends more easily (it'll sort of look like a firework).",
        "Cut a triangle or circle in the center of the paper to view through.",
        "Center the cardboard tube on top of your circle and secure the edges with tape (unless you're using contact paper, of course).",
        "Create your plastic lenses.",
        "Get an empty plastic container or two and trace two circles using the end of your tube (permanent marker is easiest to see).",
        "With an object that's about \u00bd\" (1.25 cm) larger than your tube, draw around the previous ones.",
        "Then, cut around the each of the larger circles with scissors.",
        "Lenses!",
        "With one of the circles, cut notches all the way to the inside of the smaller circle -- this'll be called lens 1.",
        "It should sort of resemble a gear.",
        "With the other circle, cut notches to the outside tracing of the smaller circle \u2014 this'll be lens 2.",
        "Lay them flat against the table and bend the notches upwards.",
        "Assemble the inside of your kaleidoscope.",
        "To begin, slide your triangular mirror inside the cardboard tube.",
        "Take lens 1 and place it inside your tube against the edges of the mirror, notches facing up; this should form a sort of makeshift pouch.",
        "Place your selected beads, sequins, glitter, gems, and/or confetti on top of this plastic lens.",
        "Cap your gems using lens 2, notches facing down, and use masking tape to secure it all together.",
        "Decorate your tube.",
        "The easiest way to make this kaleidoscope look as impressive as possible is contact paper -- so long as you work out the bubbles!",
        "But you can also use construction paper or even gift wrap to jazz it up.",
        "And then add on some glitter or stickers if the urge strikes!",
        "If there's some tape exposed where you secured your lens, cover it in glitter!",
        "It's easy and mess-free if you pour your glitter in the crease of a folded piece of paper.",
        "Just coat the very tip of your kaleidoscope in glue and place it in the crease, rotating it around until it's fully coated.",
        "Put your kaleidoscope to good use.",
        "Done!",
        "Now all you have to do is hold it up to the light and look through it.",
        "The light bounces off the mirrors, creating the kaleidoscope effect you see inside.",
        "What happens when you jostle it?",
        "When you turn it slowly?",
        "Can you ever create the same image twice?",
        "Making an Advanced Version with Acrylic Mirror and PVC Pipe Prepare the mirrors.",
        "Cut a piece of acrylic mirror into three 7 \u20448 inch (20.0 cm) by 1 \u20448 inch (2.9 cm) rectangles, using an operating table saw with a carbide-tip blade.",
        "Use a vacuum to clean any sawdust from the mirrors.",
        "Prepare the PVC pipe.",
        "Cut a white PVC pipe with a diameter of 1 \u20442 inches (3.8 cm) to a length of 7 \u20448 inches (20.0 cm) using a chop saw with a carbide tip-wood blade.",

        "Prepare the end cap.",
        "Drill a \u20448 inch (1.0 cm) hole into the center of a 1 \u20442 inch (3.8 cm) PVC socket end cap.",
        "Wipe around the hole to remove any debris.",
        "Prepare the foam strips.",
        "Cut a strip of adhesive-backed foam into pieces about one inch long.",
        "You will need three pieces for the kaleidoscope.",
        "Prepare the foam rope.",
        "Get a piece of foam rope that's half an inch in diameter.",
        "Cut it into one inch pieces.",
        "You will need three of these for the kaleidoscope.",
        "Glue a petri dish to one end of the PVC tube.",
        "The petri dish should be 60 mm by 15 mm and should be made out of plastic.",
        "Use PVC cement to attach the petri dish to the tube, being careful not to get any cement on the dish.",
        "You can either leave the glass clear to create a \"world view\" kaleidoscope or you can create a colored kaleidoscope by drawing on the inside face of the petri dish using colored permanent markers before you attach it to the PVC tube.",
        "Assemble the mirrors.",
        "Gather the three mirrors, long sides together and gently fold them into a triangle with the shiny sides facing in.",
        "Make sure you have removed any protective film first.",
        "Neatly tape the mirrors together using transparent tape, so that the edges of the three mirrors form an equilateral triangle.",
        "Attach the foam strips to the mirrors.",
        "Remove the adhesive backing from the three pieces of foam and stick one piece on the side of each mirror, approximately one inch from the end.",
        "Place the mirrors inside the PVC tube.",
        "Gently insert the mirrors, foam end first, into the PVC tube.",
        "You may need to squeeze the foam to make it fit.",
        "Insert the three pieces of foam rope into the spaces between the mirrors and the tube.",
        "Close it up.",
        "Place the PVC end cap over the open end of the PVC tube, twist to secure tightly.",
