They also go the deepest into the wood, giving it a nice depth and beautiful color. While they're easy to apply, they don't offer protection for the wood, so you'll definitely need to add a final coat of sealant if you choose oil-based products. Oil-based stains are good for softwoods, like pine and birch. Oil-based stains usually only need 1-2 coats."

Cedar, cypress, and redwood all do well with water-based stains. Water-based stains and conditioners dry very quickly.

Gel stains work particularly well on vertical surfaces like doors or cabinets because they don't run or splatter as much.
