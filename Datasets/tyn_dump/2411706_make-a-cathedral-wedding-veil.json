    "text": " Measuring the Veil Buy some tulle netting at a fabric store. For a wide veil, use a 108 inch (2.7 m) width, and for a smaller veil, use a 72 inch (1.8 m) width. It is a good idea to buy up to 8 feet (2.4 m) of tulle so that you can cut it to your desired length. Get some help from a friend during the measuring process. You will want to decide how long you want your veil to be from the top of your head and write down the measurement. This will depend upon your height and preference. Lay the tulle out along the floor. Fold it vertically, placing the fold toward you. This may match the fold lines from the store. You may want to vacuum your carpet well before laying down delicate tulle fabric on its surface. Fold it in half horizontally this time. Take the right edge and gently align it with the left edge. Measure the length of the veil you would like according to the decision you made earlier. Keep it in its folded form. Cut any excess from the left side and not the side that has been folded in. Find a large serving platter with a gently curved edge. Lay the platter over the top left side of the veil. Mark the curve over that corner with pins. Cut the curve shape into the top left side of your tulle.  Unfold your tulle veil and lay it out on the clean floor. It should have curved corners on all sides now. Gathering the Veil Fold the right side toward the left side again, horizontally. Only fold it partially over, because you are making a blusher layer. A blusher is the part of the veil that is usually over your face as you walk down the aisle, and it is later pulled over the back of the head by the groom. The length of the blusher can be based on your preference, so you may want to consider photos of veils you like before folding. Many women no longer follow this custom of walking down the aisle with a blusher. However, many still include it on their veil and fold it over their heads before they walk, giving them an extra full layer of veil. Decide how you want to gather your veil at the top. If you choose to gather the entire fold when you sew, your veil will be fuller. If you choose to only gather it from the center, it will lay flat on the sides. You will want to start approximately one-third in, if you want to do a center gather. You will want to begin at the edge of the fold if you want to do a full gather. Thread a needle with strong nylon thread. At the point where the blusher and long layers are folded, stitch in and out of the tulle. Use small even stitches so that your gathering will look uniform. You do not need to knot the end of the thread; rather leave more than enough thread on the end so that you can knot it after it is gathered. Pull the thread tighter once you are finished stitching. You want your gather to be approximately 2 inches in width total, so that you can sew it to a hair comb of the same width. Knot the ends of the thread onto a metal or plastic hair comb.  Thread your needle with nylon thread again and stitch the gathered portion onto the top of the hair comb. Make sure the gathering is extremely secure on the hair comb. Trimming the Veil Find some satin ribbon to edge your veil and blusher. You will need a good amount of ribbon so you may want to buy a whole roll. Lay your veil out on the floor again. Pin the ribbon near the bottom edge of your veil. It is best if you pin the satin above the bottom edge so that you can sew it with a sewing machine. You will return later to cut off the excess tulle from the bottom. Pin the ribbon near the bottom edge of your blusher.  Thread your sewing machine with nylon thread in the same color as your veil. Sew the ribbon carefully onto the tulle with small stitches, taking care to back stitch a little near the edges. Sew the ribbon onto the blusher, taking care not to sew the 2 veil layers together.  Trim the bottom edge of your veil with sharp scissors. Try to trim it right under the ribbon, but do not cut into the stitches.",
