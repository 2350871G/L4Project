Packing a Tobacco Pipe Start with a clean and empty pipe. To clean the pipe, start by running a pipe cleaner through the stem. Then, turn the pipe over and dump out the debris, or \u201cdottle,\u201d into an ashtray. Finally, blow through the pipe to clear it out completely. Pinch some tobacco. Spread it on a layer of clean paper. Break up clumps and check that it isn\u2019t moist. If it is moist, leave it spread across the paper to dry out for 10 minutes to an hour. Pack the bowl. Dangle loose strands of tobacco into the bowl of your pipe. Continue to do so, bit by bit, until it reaches the top of the bowl. Tamp the bowl of the pipe down with a tamper.

Add more tobacco in small strands until the bowl is slightly overfull. Tamp down the tobacco slightly more than you did the first time. Still use gentle pressure. Draw on the pipe again. You may need to draw more breath than last time. However, air should still come through the pipe. If air doesn\u2019t come through, then the bowl is packed too tight. Start over. Drop a few more strands into the bowl. Tamp down gently. Your bowl should be full and ready to light. Preparing to Smoke Buy a pipe. If you're just getting started, consider buying a cheap corncob pipe. Blown glass pipes are common for smoking marijuana and other non-tobacco plants. Smoke respectfully. Just like cigarettes, pipe tobacco can pollute indoor air and spread harmful secondhand smoke. Light the pipe at least 30 feet (9m) from the entrance of a public space. If you can . If it is a windy day, then pack your pipe inside and bring it outdoors to smoke. Take your time. Enjoy the smoke. Set aside 20 minutes to smoke your first pipe full of tobacco.",
