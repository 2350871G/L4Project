It retrieves an error code from the onboard computer, which shows you the reason for the check engine light. Each error code corresponds to a different part of the vehicle. To figure out which sensor is to blame, type the code into an online database like http://www.obdii.com/codes.asp. You can buy a scanner online or at most auto parts stores. If you don\u2019t have one, you could take your vehicle to an auto parts store or mechanic to have them detect the error code."

Turn the vehicle off and give it about 30 minutes to cool. If you need to touch a component before you are sure it is cool, wear protective gear.
