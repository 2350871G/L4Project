        "This doesn't mean that religion isn't right for you, it just means that this church might not be right for you.",
        "Continue your search.",
        "Listen closely to the sermon given, or the message in the service.",
        "Does it fit in with your own personal conceptions of this religion?",
        "Does it challenge your notion of the big questions, or does it validate it?",
        "Depending on what you're looking for in a church, you might have a variety of different responses.",
        "Don't be afraid to give weight to the little things.",
        "Does the dress code fit in with your own personal style?",
        "Do the people seem friendly and nice, like the kind of people you want to know?",
        "Is the coffee good?",
        "Perfectly valid questions when considering churches.",
        "Taking the Next Step Talk to someone about joining the church.",
        "If you've found a church that you really enjoy attending, go a few times as a visitor, and then consider joining the church.",
        "Depending on the religion and the church itself, there may be any number of different tasks required of you, including formally converting religions, but the process will vary from church to church.",
        "Usually, you'll want to get in touch with the pastor, minister, or preacher at the church you're attending and express your interest in joining.",
        "You'll likely be asked some questions and given a path toward joining.",
        "Don't be afraid to ask questions.",
        "If anything about the experience of going to church confuses or frustrates you, make time to speak about your concerns and ask those questions in private with a member of the staff.",
        "Church is social, but it's not just a club for fun.",
        "You're likely going in search of answers to big questions you have about the nature of life and existence, so don't be afraid to ask those questions.",
        "Consider going to study services or other classes.",
        "Many churches have separate classes or small-group activities that you should feel free to attend as much as you want.",
        "Sometimes, these will meet immediately before or immediately following the service itself, but at some churches these meetings will occur at different points throughout the week.",
        "If you're curious about the options, speak with the staff and find out what's available.",
        "If you're not interesting in in-depth study of religious texts, feel no pressure to attend.",
        "Attend the services you want and avoid the ones you don't.",
        "Volunteer your time.",
        "Churches run on the volunteer work of people like you.",
        "Passing out pamphlets, collecting donations, running the youth groups: these are all tasks that require volunteers.",
        "Even helping people park cars and greeting people at the door requires volunteers.",
        "If you feel up to it, after joining a church, consider volunteering for some responsibilities.",
        "Give back.",
        "At some churches, it's common to donate some money to the church each month, usually a certain percentage of your paycheck.",
        "It's not about amount, it's about giving a little portion of what you have to the church to keep it running smoothly and providing the service that you appreciate.",
        "Consider going on missions or regional trips.",
        "Many churches make a priority of taking their message and their practice on the road, organizing mission trips or visits to regional conferences, where many congregations of believers will gather in a certain spot.",
        "If you attend a very small church, this can be an excellent way of meeting like-minded believers from far-off places, where you'd be unlikely to meet them otherwise.",
        "If you have a great experience at your church, it's also sometimes a good idea to invite others you think might benefit from visiting your church.",
        "Spread the word."
