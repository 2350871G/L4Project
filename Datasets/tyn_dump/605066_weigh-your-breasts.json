        "Repeat the process with your other breast.",
        "Once you\u2019ve estimated the weight of one breast, repeat the process with the other one.",
        "Since most people\u2019s breasts are not exactly equal in size, you\u2019re likely to get 2 slightly different results.",
        "To get the most accurate possible results, try weighing each beast 2-3 times to make sure you get a consistent measurement each time.",
        "Estimating Your Breast Weight Based on Cup Size Find out your band size.",
        "To estimate your breast weight based on your bra size, you\u2019ll need an accurate idea of what your bra size is.",
        "This means figuring out both your band size and your bust size, then using the difference to find your cup size.",
        "Start by wrapping a fabric measuring tape around your ribcage just under your breasts.",
        "Round the measurement up to the nearest whole number.",
        "Add 4 if the resulting number is even or add 5 if it\u2019s odd.Keep in mind: Bras are sized differently from one country to another, and measurements also vary between individual manufacturers.",
        "This technique will help you estimate your breast weight based on U.S. bra sizes from a few of the most common bra brands.",
        "For example, if the measurement you get is 30 inches (76 cm), add 4 to get your band size of 34.",
        "Measure your bust size.",
        "Next, wrap the measuring tape around your breasts at the fullest point, just over the nipple.",
        "Round up the result to the nearest whole number.",
        "This measurement will give you your bust size.",
        "For example, if you get a measurement of 35.6 inches (90 cm), round it up to 36 inches (91 cm).",
        "It\u2019s best to do this without a bra on so that you get an accurate measurement.",
        "Subtract your band size from your bust size to calculate your cup size.",
        "Your cup size is based on the difference between your band size and your bust size.",
        "The bigger the difference, the larger your cup size is.",
        "For example:\nIf the difference is 0 inches (0 cm), you are an AA cup.",
        "If the difference is 1 inch (2.5 cm), you are an A cup.",
        "If the difference is 2 inches (5.1 cm), you are a B cup.",
        "If the difference is 3 inches (7.6 cm), you are a C cup.",
        "If the difference is 4 inches (10 cm), you are a D cup.",
        "If the difference is 5 inches (13 cm), you are a DD or E cup.",
        "If the difference is 6 inches (15 cm), you are a DDD or F cup.",
        "If the difference is 7 inches (18 cm), you are a G cup.",
        "If the difference is 8 inches (20 cm), you are an H cup.",
        "If the difference is 9 inches (23 cm), you are an I cup.",
        "If the difference is 10 inches (25 cm), you are a J cup.",
        "Alternatively, you can find your cup size by filling in your measurement info using an online bra size questionnaire.",
        "Use search terms like \u201cbra fit quiz.\u201d Put your band size and cup size together to get your bra size.",
        "Once you know both your band size and your cup size, combine them to get your bra size.",
        "For example, if you have a band size of 34 and a B cup, you\u2019re a 34B.",
        "If you\u2019d rather not do all the measurements yourself, you can also go to a lingerie store and get a professional fitting.",

        "Once you know your bra size, you can estimate the weight of each breast by consulting the chart below.",
        "Keep in mind that this method provides a very rough estimate, and does not take into account the natural differences in weight between each breast.",
        "It also doesn\u2019t account for the variations in breast density from one person to another.",
        "32A, 30B, 28C: approximately 0.5 pounds (0.23 kg) per breast\n34A, 32B, 30C, 28D: approximately 0.6 pounds (0.27 kg) per breast\n36A, 34B, 32C, 30D, 28E: approximately 0.7 pounds (0.32 kg) per breast\n38A, 36B, 34C, 32D, 30E, 28F: approximately 0.9 pounds (0.41 kg) per breast\n40A, 38B, 36C, 34D, 32E, 30F, 28G: approximately 1.2 pounds (0.54 kg) per breast\n42A, 40B, 38C, 36D, 34E, 32F, 30G, 28H: approximately 1.5 pounds (0.68 kg) per breast\n44A, 42B, 40C, 38D, 36E, 34F, 32G, 30H, 28I: approximately 1.7 pounds (0.77 kg) per breast\n44B, 42C, 40D, 38E, 36F, 34G, 32H, 30I, 28J: approximately 2 pounds (0.91 kg) per breast Getting a Medical Evaluation Tell your doctor if you have concerns about your breast weight.",

        "Imaging tests can be costly, and they also come with some risks, such as radiation exposure.",
        "As an alternative, some doctors use the Archimedes method, which is based on water displacement, to estimate the volume of the breast.",
        "From there, they can also get an estimate of the weight of your breast.",
