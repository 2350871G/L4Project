Stir them together to completely incorporate the two ingredients. To make larger quantities, add more cream of tartar and water and mix it into a paste. Cream of tartar, otherwise known as potassium bitartrate, is an acidic by-product of winemaking that can be used to clean and scrub metal, ceramic, stone, and other surfaces. This paste is good for scrubbing soot and fireplace buildup from brick."

To make larger quantities, mix equal parts soap and salt, by weight, in a larger container. Add enough water to make the mixture spreadable.
