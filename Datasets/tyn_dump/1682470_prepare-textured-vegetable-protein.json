It has a long shelf life and can be found in your grocery store's health food section or with other bulk foods. Textured vegetable protein in a non-sealed sack has a shelf life of about a year, but textured vegetable protein in an airtight container will last much longer. Because textured vegetable protein is made from soybeans, the cost of the product is relatively inexpensive. You can purchase flavored TVP, either dry or frozen, which can be heated and added to a number of dishes. However, since TVP is so easy to cook with and flavor yourself, it's best to start with dried TVP free of additives and flavors. That way, you can add whatever spices and flavors you want, without the extra chemicals."

The TVP will reconstitute as part of the dish - there's no need to do it separately.
