        "If you can\u2019t find a pool noodle, look for foam blocks at general stores and craft supply stores, or shop online.",
        "Cut the foam about 2 in (5.1 cm) wider than the clipboard.",
        "Place the pool noodle on the edge of the clipboard behind the clip.",
        "Make sure it goes at least 1 in (2.5 cm) past the clipboard on both ends.",
        "Measure it as needed with a ruler, then use a sharp pair of scissors or a craft knife to cut off the excess material.",
        "The pen holder can be longer if you want it to be, but keep in mind that the extra length makes it more difficult to use and store.",
        "If you\u2019re going to keep it out on your desk, for example, the extra length might not matter besides giving you room to store more pens.",
        "Slice the foam lengthwise to fit it onto the clipboard.",
        "Make the cut horizontally from one end of the pool noodle to the other.",
        "Cut down the center in a single, straight line.",
        "Deepen the cut to the center of the foam, then pull the foam apart with your fingers.",
        "Work slowly.",
        "Craft knives are sharp, and you may end up damaging the foam or your fingers if you aren\u2019t careful.",
        "Place the foam onto the edge of your clipboard.",
        "Push the top of the clipboard into the cut you made.",
        "Make sure your pen holder fits tightly by cutting away excess foam or deepening the lengthwise cut as needed.",
        "Ideally, the foam shouldn't get in the way of the clip, but covering it is okay.",
        "You can put the foam over the clip.",
        "The clip will fit inside the cut you made without harming your pen holder.",
        "If the pen holder is too wide, you may need to remove it in order to use the clip, though.",
        "Mark and cut holes in the foam for your pens.",
        "Make the first hole in the center of the pen holder.",
        "Use your craft knife to mark a spot as wide as the pen you plan on storing.",
        "Then, scrape out a little bit of the foam to create a small hole to fit the pen in.",
        "Cut multiple holes as needed if you plan on storing additional pens, spacing the holes about 1 in (2.5 cm) apart.",
        "If you plan on storing your pen vertically, cut an X on the top edge of the foam.",
        "If you're planning on laying your pen horizontally, make a small horizontal slit on the top side of the foam.",
        "Pens need to be placed vertically or horizontally in order to stay in the holder.",
        "Anything placed at a diagonal angle will eventually fall out.",
        "Pool noodles often have empty space inside.",
        "If you\u2019re using a solid piece of foam, you may need to cut out a little more of the foam in order to get the pens to fit.",
        "Push your pens into the holes to store them.",
        "Place a pen in each hole you cut, pushing them down until they stand or lay in place.",
        "Keep in mind that pens come in all sorts of sizes, so you may need to widen some of the holes or choose different pens.",
        "When you\u2019re done using the holder, you can slide it off the clipboard or even move it to another side.",
        "For additional storage space, hollow out the center of the foam.",
        "Most pool noodles are already hollow in the center, so you won't have to do this yourself if you're using one.",
        "Try storing extra pens, erasers, coloring supplies, or anything else you may need."
