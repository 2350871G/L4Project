Using the ideal gas model, determine the final equilibrium pressure, in bar; the heat transfer for the process in kJ\nNote it is easier to solve the problem by working with just variables, and then at the last step plug in the values. This same method will be followed here. Write out the Known Knowledge. Using the information from the problem we know that both tanks have the same gas, one tank has 2 kg of gas at 77 \u00b0C (171 \u00b0F) at 0.7 bar. The other tank has \t8 kg of gas at 27 \u00b0C (80.6 \u00b0F) and 1.2 bar. We also know the final temperature of the system is 42 \u00b0C (108 \u00b0F). Write out what the problem wants you to find. To solve the problem in a closed system, 0.25kg of air initially at 1.034bar with a specific volume of 0.849 meter (2.8 ft)-cube/kg is compressed reversibly according to the law PV RAISE TO POWER 1.3 EQUALS CONSTANT until its pressure is 2.068bar.the specific internal energy of the air is 1.58pv where p is in KN/METERSQUARE and v is in meter-cube per kilogram determine the heat transfer. Write the assumptions needed to solve. These assumptions are obtained through using the problem information and inferring ways that can be applied to this problem. For this problem the assumptions are as follows:\nThe total amount of carbon monoxide gas is a closed system (the carbon monoxide gas cannot leave or enter the system)\nThe gas is modeled as an ideal gas with constant cv. (This was assumed because the problem stated that the ideal gas model can be used and cv can only be used in an ideal situation)\nThe gas initially in each tank is in equilibrium. The final state is an equilibrium state too. (This is assumed because the problem wants us to analyze the final equilibrium state)\nNo energy is transferred to, or from the gas by work. (This assumption is that energy is conserved because there are no external forces doing work on the system)\nThere is no change in kinetic or potential energy. (Assumption based on conservation of energy due to the assumption above) Begin solving for the final equilibrium pressure. Use the ideal gas law. Pf is the final equilibrium pressure, V is the total volume of the system after the valve is release, m is the total mass of the system, R is the universal gas constant with a known value, and Tf is the final equilibrium temperature that is given. Solve for Pf. Rework equation 1 to solve for Pf, by dividing by volume. Obtain the total mass. The mass is the total mass of the two tanks because now both tanks are mix in this final state. The total mass is used because we are evaluating the final pressure in the final state. This is the state in which the gas is mixed together so the mass of the whole system needs to be considered. Obtain the total volume. The volume V is the total amount of volume from both tanks for the same reason as the mass. Unfortunately, the volume of the tanks is not given so we need to solve for it. Use the ideal gas equation. Since the initial pressure, temperature, and mass are given the initial volume of each tank can be calculated using the ideal gas equation shown in equation 1. This is where V1, P1, and T1 denote the conditions in tank 1, and V2, P2, and T2 denote the initial conditions in tank 2. Reworking the ideal gas law to solve for V, by dividing by pressure: Substitute values. Substituting Values into Equation 3 Solving for Pf. Equation Simplify by removing common terms. This can be done by using the universal gas constant. Input the known values in the problem. These known values should be:m1 = 2 kg, m2 = 8 kg, T1 = 77 \u00b0C (171 \u00b0F)\t, T2 = 27\u00b0C, P1 = 0.7 bar, P2 = 1.2 bar, Tf = 42\u00b0C Solve the equation. Solving the equation gives a final pressure of 1.05 bar. Solving for the Heat Transfer Set up an energy balance equation. Set up an energy balance equation for the system using the general energy balance equation shown below, where \u2206U is the change in internal energy, Q is the energy produce by heat transfer, and W is the work. Apply the assumption that there is no work done on the system or change in kinetic or potential energy. This simplifies the equation above by setting work to zero. Simplify \u2206U. Simplifying \u2206U gives us: where Uf is the final internal energy, and Ui is the initial internal energy. Finding the Initial Internal Energy of System Evaluate what initial internal energy is defined as. The initial internal energy is a summation of the internal energy in each tank at the beginning of the process. The general internal energy equation is shown below, where m is the total mass, and u(T) is the internal energy evaluated at temperature T. Use previous equations. Using the equations above we find the initial internal energy, where m1 is the mass in tank 1, m2 is the mass in tank 2, and T1 and T2 are the initial temperatures in tank one and tank two respectively. Substituting Known Information into Energy Balance Equation Use the previous equation.  Multiply variables out.  Combine like terms.  Applying the Law of Specific Heat Constants Understand the law of specific heats. The law of specific heats allows for a simplification in the difference of the internal energies at two temperatures. The use of a specific heat constant, cv, allows for the simplification of the difference of the internal energies at two states to just the temperatures at these states. This law applies to only ideal gases, and can be used due to our assumption of ideal gas. The relationship is seen below in equation 23. Apply to equation 22. Applying this to equation 22 we get Looking in the Table T-10 to find the c_v constants Convert temperature. Convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin by adding 273 to both initial temperatures. 273 is the conversion factor from Celsius to Kelvin. The temperatures will be at 300 K, and 350 K. Find carbon monoxide gas in the table. Look in the table for carbon monoxide gas at the values for the temperatures at 300 K and 350 K. Pay attention to only look at the table for the cv constant as the cp is for enthalpy. What you should look at is shown below:",

        "The use of a specific heat constant, cv, allows for the simplification of the difference of the internal energies at two states to just the temperatures at these states.",
        "This law applies to only ideal gases, and can be used due to our assumption of ideal gas.",
        "The relationship is seen below in equation 23.",
        "Apply to equation 22.",
        "Applying this to equation 22 we get Looking in the Table T-10 to find the c_v constants Convert temperature.",
        "Convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin by adding 273 to both initial temperatures.",
        "273 is the conversion factor from Celsius to Kelvin.",
        "The temperatures will be at 300 K, and 350 K. Find carbon monoxide gas in the table.",
        "Look in the table for carbon monoxide gas at the values for the temperatures at 300 K and 350 K. Pay attention to only look at the table for the cv constant as the cp is for enthalpy.",
        "What you should look at is shown below:"
