Press lightly with your pencil so you can erase these lines later. Make sure to draw the doll in a pose that will be easy to put clothes on, such as standing up straight with the arms down and slightly lifted away from its sides. Try sketching out some ideas on scratch paper first, then drawing your doll on a thicker piece of paper, such as a sheet of cardstock. A standard paper doll size is generally 5 to 6 inches (13 to 15 cm) tall and 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) wide. You may also want to draw on some undergarments that can be easily covered by clothes, such as a close-fitting slip, a camisole, or underwear and a bra."

Be careful around smaller, delicate areas such as the hands, base, or feet. Young children should use safety scissors for cutting. Cutting out individual fingers and toes will make these areas likely to be damaged or torn. Instead, cut around any individually drawn fingers or toes, making a general hand or foot shape.
