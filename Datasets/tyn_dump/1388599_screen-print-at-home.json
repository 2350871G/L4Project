For a little more money you can purchase an aluminum frame that will last longer, as repeated washing will warp a wooden canvas.

Mesh count is the number of threads in one square inch. For the classic \"athletic\" or collegiate print that looks worn/speckled, aim for a loose 85 mesh count. For a \"do-it-all\" mesh, aim for 110-130 mesh count. For paper or plastic printing, go for a mesh count near 200-250. In general, lighter colored objects work best with higher mesh counts.
