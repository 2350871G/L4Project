Start by playing soft music or fireworks sounds for your pet a few weeks before the fireworks. Then, gradually increase the sound of the music or fireworks each day until you are playing it at a loud volume. Offer petting, praise, and treats to your pet for keeping calm. Playing loud noises after the fireworks can help to desensitize it further, by showing it that what it just experienced is not scary."

In a stable, keep the lights on and keep the doors locked, although sedatives are the best method to calm your outdoor farm animals. Use familiar sounds to drown out the noise of the fireworks. Classical music, the sound of rain, or the sound of the TV, are some common noises that can soothe your pet."

It should be a room you can close off to stop your pet from running about the house and creating a mess. Make sure your outdoor animals are locked in their pen and consider moving them to a more central pen in your barn or stable to keep them away from doors and windows. If you have more than one pet, be sure they don't mind being confined in the same room, or select several rooms for different pets. For example, dogs and cats will usually appreciate being separated. If you must separate animals, make a second room as insulated as you can and keep the most anxious animal in the central room, and stay with and comfort the animal in the second room."

In dogs, signs of stress include anxious barking, running away, soiling the house, cowering, clinging to their owner, whimpering, trembling, pacing, and refusing to eat. In small rodents, signs of stress include hiding, staying silent, excessive tooth grinding and acting more aggressively than usual. In horses and stable animals, signs of stress include soiling themselves, refusing to eat, sweating, and tooth grinding.Tip: If you think your pet is stressed, keep it indoors overnight.
