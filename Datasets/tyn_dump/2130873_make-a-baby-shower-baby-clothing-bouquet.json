        "It would be a good idea to wrap clear cellophane around it to hold everything together, however.",
        "Wrap a ribbon around the stems and tie it into a bow.",
        "Choose a wide, satin ribbon that matches or coordinates with your bouquet.",
        "Wrap it a few times around the stems to ensure stability, then tie the ends into a pretty bow.",
        "For a nicer touch, cut the ends of the ribbon at angles or into notches.",
        "If the ribbon is fraying, seal the ends with a flame.",
        "Finishing a Container Bouquet Choose a flower pot or metal pail for the bouquet.",
        "Make sure that the container matches the theme of your bouquet.",
        "For example, instead of using a plain terracotta flower pot or a bare-metal pail, try the following:\nSpray paint the container white to keep things neutral.",
        "Spray paint the container pink or blue to match the baby's gender.",
        "Use stencils to add polka dots for a fancier touch.",
        "Use white for pink or blue containers, and pink/blue for white containers.",
        "Trim the wire stems down to the height of the container, if needed.",
        "The stems of the \"flowers\" need to be short enough so that they are completely hidden by your container; the blooms should be sticking out just over the rim.",
        "Use heavy-duty wire cutters to cut wire stems; if you have wooden stems, snap them between your fingers instead.",
        "Tuck a piece of tissue paper into the container for a nicer look.",
        "The tissue paper should be big enough to stick out over the top edges of your container by a few inches/centimeters.",
        "If the tissue paper is too big and obscures the flowers, cut or fold it in half.",
        "Choose a color that coordinates with your container.",
        "For example, if you have a white container with pink polka dots, try pink tissue paper.",
        "Stick a piece of floral Styrofoam into the bottom of the container.",
        "The foam should be tall enough to reach halfway up the side of the container.",
        "If the foam is too tall, cut it down with a serrated knife.",
        "Make sure that the width of your foam matches the bottom width of your container.",
        "Use a square block of Styrofoam for square containers and a dome or disk-shaped piece of Styrofoam for round containers.",
        "Do not use the smooth, dark green, squishy foam meant for real flowers.",
        "It won't hold as well and is unnecessary.",
        "Stick the flowers into the container, starting from the middle.",
        "Choose your largest flower, and stick it straight into the container, right in the middle.",
        "Add the rest of the flowers around it, working your way towards the edges of the container.",
        "Push the flowers in deep enough so that the stems touch the bottom of the container.",
        "Fill the gaps in with silk flowers or greenery, if needed.",
        "If you notice gaps in your bouquet, you should fill them in.",
        "Buy some silk flowers that match your bouquet, trim them down, then add them in.",
        "Alternatively, get some silk greenery and add it in.",
        "Alternatively, you can make more flowers using extra baby clothes, and add those in instead.",
        "Again, the silk flowers need to be just tall enough to peak over the top edge of the container.",
        "Wrap and tie a matching ribbon around the container.",
        "Choose a wide, satin ribbon that goes well with your bouquet.",
        "Find the middle and add a piece of double-sided tape to keep it from sliding.",
        "Wrap the ribbon around the container, then tie the ends into a bow.",
        "Cut the ends of the ribbon into notches or angles for a nicer touch.",
        "If the ribbon is fraying, seal the ends with a flame.",
        "Finished."
