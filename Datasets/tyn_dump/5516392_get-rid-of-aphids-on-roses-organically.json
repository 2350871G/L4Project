Ladybugs feed on aphids, and a few ladybugs can go along way when it comes to eliminating pests.Tip: Ladybugs will not stay in your garden forever. Once most of the aphids have been eaten, they may fly off to a different area of your garden, or fly away altogether. Place your bugs around the base of your rose bushes and wait for them to wake up a little before they get to work. Mist the ladybugs with warm water after you drop them off to incentivize them to stay in your garden. Ladybugs prefer humid environments, so a little water will help keep them in your garden."

Try to coexist peacefully with wasps, but if you end up with a nest nearby, you may need to get rid of it. Catnip, oregano, fennel, and mint will all attract predatory insects."
