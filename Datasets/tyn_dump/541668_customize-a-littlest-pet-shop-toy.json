Wet a cotton ball or one corner of a washcloth with it and rub it against your LPS toy, pressing down firmly. Continue wetting your washcloth and removing the paint until your LPS toy is down to its plain base coat. You can also paint the LPS in white acrylic paint if you don't have acetone but this will take a bit longer. Always wash the pet before continuing, as the acetone can also ruin the paint. Wear a mask to prevent breathing in any dangerous fumes. Don\u2019t try to take the paint off with nail polish remover. It will smear the paint instead of taking it off.Warning: Acetone is highly flammable. Only use it with adult supervision and never put it near heat, like a microwave or oven."
