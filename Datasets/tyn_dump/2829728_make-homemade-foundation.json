        "This recipe is for medium-coverage foundation.",
        "This may be more than what you are looking for, or it might not be enough.",
        "Fortunately, this is easy to fix:\nIf you want more coverage, stir in more powdered foundation.",
        "If you want something more sheer, add more facial oil or moisturizer.",
        "Transfer the foundation into a small, clean jar.",
        "How big this container is depends on how much foundation you made; it should be small enough to fit most of your foundation, however.",
        "An old foundation bottle or a lip balm jar would be ideal.",
        "Make sure that the container is clean.",
        "Wash it with soap and water, then dry it with a paper towel.",
        "You can sterilize it further with rubbing alcohol, if you want.",
        "A foundation bottle with a pump would be an even better idea.",
        "This way, you won't contaminate it by exposing it to air.",
        "Apply the foundation, let it dry, then apply powder.",
        "Use makeup sponge, a foundation brush, or your fingers to apply the foundation and blend it in.",
        "Let it sit and dry for a few minutes, then apply your desired setting powder or blush.",
        "If you put the foundation into a jar, it would be best to apply it with a brush or sponge, otherwise you risk contaminating it with your fingers.",
        "Store the foundation in a cool, dry place.",
        "This foundation should last a long time, but it may discolor or develop mold, especially if it gets wet.",
        "If any of this happens, discard it."
