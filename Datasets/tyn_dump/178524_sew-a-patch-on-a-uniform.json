Many uniforms are made out of cotton. Cotton will usually shrink somewhat after the first wash. If you sew a patch onto your uniform before it has been washed then the fabric under the patch will shrink and pull your patch, bunching it. It is also a good idea to iron the area where the patch is to be placed before starting to sew. Ironing the area will remove any wrinkles. If you sew your patch over wrinkles then your uniform will be permanently wrinkled."

For example, if you need to sew on an American flag patch you need to place it on the shoulder/bicep area of the sleeve. The flag also needs to be placed so it\u2019s facing the right direction. The American flag should always be positioned so that when the wearer is moving forward, it gives the flag the effect of waving in the wind, moving forward.

You should leave a little thread about 1/2\u201d (1cm) long. Leaving just a bit ensures that you don\u2019t accidentally cut the knots.",

        " Hand Sewing a Patch Wash, dry, and iron your uniform before you begin.",
        "If it\u2019s a new uniform, make sure to wash and dry once before sewing on the patch, otherwise, the fabric will bunch unevenly under the patch after the first wash and dry cycle.",
        "Many uniforms are made out of cotton.",
        "Cotton will usually shrink somewhat after the first wash.",
        "If you sew a patch onto your uniform before it has been washed then the fabric under the patch will shrink and pull your patch, bunching it.",
        "It is also a good idea to iron the area where the patch is to be placed before starting to sew.",
        "Ironing the area will remove any wrinkles.",
        "If you sew your patch over wrinkles then your uniform will be permanently wrinkled.",
        "Get a sewing needle and thread.",
        "Choose a thread that is either the color of the uniform or the color of the edge of the patch.",
        "If you can\u2019t find a thread that\u2019s the same color as either, look for a darker color that\u2019s as close as possible.",
        "Darker rather than lighter thread will blend better and not show up as blatantly.",
        "You can also get a clear thread to make it less visible.",
        "Position the patch in the correct placement.",
        "Some patches such as those on military uniforms need to be placed in a specific area.",
        "For example, if you need to sew on an American flag patch you need to place it on the shoulder/bicep area of the sleeve.",
        "The flag also needs to be placed so it\u2019s facing the right direction.",
        "The American flag should always be positioned so that when the wearer is moving forward, it gives the flag the effect of waving in the wind, moving forward.",
        "Check with your superiors to make sure you are placing patches in the correct places.",
        "Put on the uniform with the patch held by with a safety pin.",
        "This is to check if it is positioned correctly.",
        "it can help to have someone else confirm this with you.",
        "Be careful when wearing your uniform with pins holding the patch.",
        "Carefully put the uniform on so the pins don\u2019t poke you.",
        "The reason you may want to check how it fits is that when wearing your uniform your body will fill out the garment.",
        "This could affect how the patch looks.",
        "Secure your patch in place for sewing.",
        "Use a safety pin or straight pin to hold the patch in place.",
        "Or, alternatively, use adhesive fabric tape to iron the patch on.",
        "Even if you don\u2019t have an iron-on patch, you might want to get some adhesive ironing tape.",
        "The adhesive tape is usually better than pins because it sticks the patch in place while you sew.",
        "You won\u2019t have to worry about sewing around pins and poking yourself.",
        "Cut and place the tape.",
        "Place the patch on the tape and iron.",
        "If you don\u2019t iron the patch, you\u2019ll have to pin the patch in place.",
        "Cut a piece of thread.",
        "If you're not very familiar with sewing, you may want to start with a piece of thread no longer than 18 inches (45cm).",
        "Longer pieces tend to get tangled and are harder to work with than shorter ones.",
        "Alternatively, you can try not cutting the thread and leaving it on the spool.",
        "This will help prevent the thread from getting tangled as well.",
        "Additionally, you won\u2019t have to worry about running out of thread and re-threading your needle.",
        "Thread the needle and tie a knot at the end of the thread.",
        "Threading the needle can be difficult.",
        "If you have a needle threading tool, use it to save time.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a threading tool, it can help to twist and wet the thread in your mouth.",
        "The saliva will serve as a temporary adhesive to hold the tiny strands of thread together.",
        "This allows you to better thread the eye of the needle.",
        "Begin threading the needle through your fabric and the patch.",
        "Start on the inside of your garment and poke the needle out, coming up through the patch.",
        "You\u2019ll want to start on the inside of your fabric, so the knot you create to hold the thread in place isn\u2019t showing on the outside.",
        "Start inside and poke the needle out.",
        "Sew with a straight stitch pattern.",
        "Run the needle back through the uniform about 1/4\u201d (6mm) from where you brought it out.",
        "For patches, a straight stitch is not only the easiest but the quickest way to sew the patch on.",
        "You don\u2019t need a complicated stitching pattern, especially if you ironed on your patch.",
        "A straight stitch will also be the least visible.",
        "Continue stitching the patch.",
        "Continue your straight stitch until you\u2019ve gone all the way around your patch.",
        "You should end where you started.",
        "When hand sewing a patch onto a uniform it\u2019s important to take your time and do your best to make sure that your weaves and the length of your stitches are as even to one another as possible.",
        "Keeping an even pattern will make your patch look much better.",
        "Knot your thread.",
        "When you have sewn all the way around the edge of the patch, loop the thread and pull the needle through to tie off your knot.",
        "To complete sewing your patch, thread your needle through so that you create a small loop on the inside of your uniform.",
        "Bring the needle through the loop and pull the thread tight.",
        "This will create a tight knot.",
        "Cut the ends of the thread.",
        "Cut any loose threads that are hanging beyond the knot.",
        "You should leave a little thread about 1/2\u201d (1cm) long.",
        "Leaving just a bit ensures that you don\u2019t accidentally cut the knots.",
        "Tuck the thread under the patch.",
        "Machine Sewing a Patch Iron your garment.",

        "Place and arrange the patch where you want it.",
        "It\u2019s smart to place your patch on your garment or uniform and make sure it\u2019s in the correct spot before sewing.",
        "If you sew your patch onto your uniform and realize you have put it in the wrong place you\u2019ll have to remove the patch and start all over again.",
        "Iron on your patch.",
        "Even if you don\u2019t have an iron-on patch, you might want to get some adhesive ironing tape.",
        "Cut and place the tape.",
        "Place the patch on the tape and iron.",
        "If you don\u2019t iron the patch, you\u2019ll have to pin the patch in place.",
        "Pinning your patch will create more work for you when using your machine.",
        "Place the garment on your sewing machine.",
        "Set up your machine so that your needle length is shorter for the patch.",
        "Set the machine to a straight stitch.",
        "And place your presser foot in the up position.",
        "different sewing machines will have different features and capabilities.",
        "It\u2019s best to refer to your manual to get the best results.",
        "Make sure that you are only sewing the patch onto one piece of fabric.",

        "Refer to your manual.",
        "Make sure you have the correct color thread in place.",
        "You should either use thread that\u2019s the color of the patch or clear thread.",
        "Put the machine on a low-speed setting to start.",
        "Your sewing machine will most likely have different speed settings.",

        "Make sure that the foot of the sewing machine is up, but the needle is in place.",
