    "text": " Soft Wood Purchase commercially prepared wood filler in a color that matches your wooden surface.  Inspect the surface of the wood. You are looking for knots, protruding nails, small cracks and miniature holes left by pests. You will also need to note the conditions of the edges of your wood. If the edges are rough, then you will need to use filler to make them even. Place the small end of a nail set on top of any protruding nails. Hammer the wide end of the nail set to push the protruding nails below the surface. If you\u2019re working with softwood, place a small bead of wood filler on the edge of a putty knife. Use the putty knife to apply the wood filler to the defects, smoothing the surface with the edge of the putty knife after you fill the defects with the wood filler. Continue adding more filler until the filler is smooth and even with the wooden surface. Allow the filler to dry before you sand the wood. Clamp 100-grit sandpaper to your sanding block. Sand the edges of your wood until the surfaces are even. Set the sanding block aside when you are finished with the edges. Hold a piece of 100-grit sandpaper in your hand so that the back of the sandpaper is in contact with your palm and fingers. Sand any hard-to-reach areas or curved surfaces by rubbing the sandpaper along the surface with your hand in the direction of the wood grain. Wipe down the sanded surface with a tack cloth or with a paper towel soaked in mineral spirits.  Repeat the process using 150-grit sandpaper to sand the surface.  After you\u2019ve cleaned the sanded surface again with your tack cloth or with mineral spirits, repeat the process a third time using 220-grit paper.  Clean your wood thoroughly, and clean your work surface with a soft, lint-free cloth (not a tack cloth). This will ensure that no dirt, debris or sawdust clings to your finished surface. Dip the edge of your brush in the stain and apply a thin layer of stain to the surface of the wood. Always brush along the grain using long, even strokes. Work on one portion of the wood at a time instead of trying to stain the entire piece all at once. Examine the surface. If you see any blotchy areas or areas where the brushstrokes did not blend well together, then use a soft, lint-free cloth to rub the stain until it looks more even. Move to a different section of the wood and apply more stain with your brush.  Use a cloth to even out blotches and to blend the edges between brushstrokes.  Repeat the process, continuing to work on one portion at a time until the piece is finished.  Allow the stain to dry overnight. If the color is not as deep as you would like, then apply additional coats of stain to the piece until you achieve the desired result. Make sure to let each coat dry completely before adding an additional coat. Hard Wood Roll a bead of wood filler onto the edge of a putty knife. Apply the filler to cracks, knots and nail holes until the surface of the filler is even with the wood surface. Use the putty knife to smooth out the filler. Sand the filler gently after it has dried to make sure that the surface is flush with the wood. Do your best not to damage the surface that you have already stained. Apply a coat of polyurethane to your stained wood using a 2\u201d (5 centimeter) brush. Brush the product on using long strokes, and work in the direction of the wood grain. Work in 6\u201d to 12\u201d sections. Blend the brush strokes between sections by lightly stroking the intersection with the brush. When you are finished, the sections should blend seamlessly together. Allow the first coat of polyurethane to cure overnight. Sand the surface the next day using 280-grit or finer sandpaper. Apply a second coat of polyurethane and allow the second coat to cure overnight. You do not have to sand the final coat. Wrap 100-grit sandpaper around the work surface of your electric sander. Clip the paper tightly in place, making sure that the work surface is taut so that your sandpaper doesn\u2019t bunch up or loosen. Plug the sander into an electrical outlet.  Grip the back of the sander with your dominant hand. Turn the device on and rest it on your work surface. Move the electric sander back and forth in the direction of the wood grain until you have sanded your entire surface. Never sand across the grain; you will leave scratches that will show up when the stain is applied. When you are finished, turn the sander off, unplug it and set it aside.  Wipe the surface of the wood with a tack cloth or with a paper towel that has been dipped in mineral spirits.  Remove your used 100-grit sandpaper from your sander and discard it.  Clip 150-grit sandpaper to your electric sander.  Repeat the process of sanding along the grain and wiping down the surface.  Discard your 150-grit sandpaper and repeat the process again with 220-grit paper. If you\u2019re working with hardwood, then wipe the surface with a damp cloth before you sand it with the 220-grit paper. This will raise the grain of the wood and allow you to create a very smooth surface.",
