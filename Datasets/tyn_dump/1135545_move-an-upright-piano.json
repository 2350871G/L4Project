For example, pants that are too tight could tear as you squat to lift the piano. Wear athletic shoes or work boots with a treaded sole that grips floors and outdoor surfaces well. And use a pair of work gloves with rubber-treated palms to help you get a better grip on the piano. Don't wear long jewelry, such as necklaces or bracelets, that could get caught in tight spaces while moving.
