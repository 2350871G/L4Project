Make a shallow incision from the head to the anus, and scoop out guts with a spoon. Remove the head with a sharp knife. You can cut large fish into steaks, by chopping the short way across, or fillets by slicing the long way, on either side of the bones. You can freeze really small fish whole, after cleaning them. You don't need to cut them into tiny-teeny fillets. Wear gloves or wash your hands very thoroughly during this process. Raw fish and fish guts can carry bacteria and parasites."

        "Make sure to cook your fish immediately after you thaw it, so it doesn\u2019t go bad.",
        "If you want to thaw your fish really quickly, you can defrost it in the microwave.",
        "This will take about 5-7 minutes for 1 pound of frozen fillets.",
        "However, thawing in the microwave has less consistent results than thawing in the refrigerator, because it can unevenly thaw the fish.",
        "Don\u2019t thaw fish at room temperature.",
        "That\u2019s the perfect recipe for bacteria.",
        "Don\u2019t refreeze fish once you\u2019ve thawed it.",
        "It\u2019s horrible for the texture.",
        "Pickling Fish Clean and fillet the fish and remove the skin.",
        "Clean the fish by making a shallow incision from the head to the anus, and scooping out guts with a spoon.",
        "Remove the head with a sharp knife.",
        "Fillet the fish by slicing halfway into the fish, until you hit the backbone, from below the head to the tail.",
        "Repeat on the other side and throw out the bones.",
        "Make sure to remove the skin, because that doesn't pickle well.",
        "Freeze the fish for at least 48 hours.",
        "The freezing temperature kills off any parasites that might be hiding in the fish.",
        "These parasites can infect humans if you eat them and make you sick, so it's important to kill them off.",
        "Some regions have more parasites than others.",
        "For example, the Great Lakes Region is infested with the broad fish tapeworm.",
        "But wherever you\u2019ve caught your fish, it\u2019s best to freeze it just as a precaution.",
        "Soak the fish in a salt brine for 48 hours in the refrigerator.",
        "To make the salt brine, fill a large bowl with cool water and add table salt.",
        "Keep adding salt and mixing until an egg can float at the top of the brine.",
        "That\u2019s when you know it\u2019s salty enough, and you can add in your fish.",
        "Cover the bowl and place it in the refrigerator for 48 hours to soak.",
        "Refrigeration is important at all points of the process because the fish is raw and can spoil easily if it gets warm.",
        "Remove the fish from the salt brine and rinse it with cool water.",
        "You can pour out the salt brine; you don\u2019t need it anymore.",
        "To rinse the fish, run cool water over it.",
        "Now you\u2019ve completed the first brining, but your fish is far from pickled.",
        "It still needs to soak in vinegar, and then in a pickling brine.",
        "Since this is such a long process, it\u2019s best to pickle a big batch of fish at once.",
        "Soak the fish in white vinegar in the refrigerator for 48 hours.",
        "Place the fish in a large bowl and pour in enough white vinegar that all the fish is covered.",
        "Cover the bowl with a lid or with aluminum foil.",
        "Let it sit in the refrigerator for at least 48 hours.",
        "Rinse the fish in cool water, and cut into it pieces.",
        "Remove the fish from the bowl of vinegar.",
        "Rinse the fish by holding it under cool running water.",
        "Cut it into bite-sized pieces or slightly larger strips, according to your preference.",
        "This is the size of fish chunk that you\u2019ll take out of the jar once it\u2019s all pickled.",
        "When you\u2019re working with raw fish, it\u2019s really important to clean all of the tools you use.",
        "Use hot water and soap to thoroughly clean any bowl, cutting board, knife, or anything else that touches raw fish, and wash your own hands as well.",
        "Make a pickling brine out of wine, sugar and vinegar.",
        "In a pot, combine \u20442 cup (120 ml) white wine, 1.5 cups (350 ml) cane sugar, and 2 cups (470 ml) of white vinegar.",
        "Add whatever spices you\u2019d like.",
        "Simmer the mixture on the stove and stir it until the sugar dissolves.",
        "Once the sugar is dissolved, remove the pickling brine from the stove and cool.",
        "If you put in any big spices, like bay leaves, strain them out.",
        "Some good pickling spices include:\nbay leaves\nallspice\nmustard seed\nwhole cloves\nground pepper\nhot ground pepper Sterilize your glass jars in boiling water for 5 minutes.",
        "Place all the jars and their lids in a pot of water on the stove to sterilize them.",
        "Bring the water to a boil and let it roll for 5 minutes.",
        "Use tongs to remove the jars from the water so that you don\u2019t scald your fingers.",
        "If your glass jars have rubber rings, you can boil those too.",
        "Layer thinly sliced onions and fish in glass jars and add brine.",
        "Slice the onions thinly on a cutting board.",
        "In the sterilized glass jars, add a thin layer of onions, then a layer of fish, and keep layering until the jar is \u00be full.",
        "Then, pour the pickling brine over the fish so that it fills up all the nooks and crannies, and there is still .5 inches (1.3 cm) of space left on the top.",
        "The extra bit of space on top will make sure that you can seal the jar properly.",
        "Put the lids on the jars and refrigerate the fish for at least 7 days.",
        "Use a permanent marker to label your jars with the kind of fish and the date that you pickled them.",
        "After 7 days, your delicious pickled fish is ready to eat!",
        "Enjoy it with crackers, on an open-faced sandwich, or any way you like.",
        "Pickled fish lasts in the refrigerator for 3-4 weeks.",
        "Corning Fish in the Wild Cut a slit into the gills below the head to bleed the fish.",
        "Cutting into the gills slices into a major artery, which makes a lot of blood drain out of the fish.",
        "Stick the fish, head-first, into a bucket of water for a few minutes until a lot of the blood drains out.",
        "Bleeding the fish reduces discoloration and fishy taste.",
        "Gut and clean the fish.",
        "Cut off the fish\u2019s head.",
        "Slit down the center of the fish\u2019s belly from the tail to 1 inch (2.5 cm) from where the head used to be.",
        "Pull the fish apart and scoop out its innards with a spoon.",
        "Use gloves to protect your hands or wash them thoroughly with warm water and soap.",
        "Weigh the fish to calculate how much salt you\u2019ll need.",
        "To effectively corn your fish, you\u2019ll need to apply about 6 percent of the fish\u2019s weight in fine-grained salt.",
        "Place the fish on a small scale and calculate how much salt you\u2019ll need.",
        "If your fish is 5 pounds (2.3 kg), you\u2019ll need .3 pounds (0.14 kg) of salt.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a scale for exact measurement, err on the side of too much salt.",
        "If you have too little salt, the fish might go rotten.",
        "Apply fine-grained salt to the skin and the belly cavity.",
        "Wear gloves, and using your hands, apply salt all over the skin of the fish and inside the belly cavity.",
        "Hold open the sides of the belly cavity to make sure salt gets all the way into the hard-to-reach places.",
        "The salt makes the water come out of the fish, which keeps it from spoiling.",
        "Place the fish in a container.",
        "Cover the container with a damp cloth.",
        "Store it in the coolest place you can find.",
        "When you store it correctly, corned fish will last for 24 hours.",
        "Soak your fish thoroughly before cooking it.",
        "Corning fish covers it in too much salt to taste good, so soak your fish in a bucket of clean water for 2 hours to get out the salt that has absorbed.",
        "If there\u2019s still some stubborn salt sticking to it, scrub it out.",
        "You can also use your corned fish to salt your stew by just tossing it in as-is."
