        "The thickness of each smear should be similar to the thickness of a nickel.",
        "Smear the wax onto your skin in the same direction as hair growth.",
        "This will make the removal process easier and less painful.",
        "Apply the wax slightly past where the hair stops growing, which will give you a \u201ctab\u201d that you can grab onto when you're ready to pull the wax off.",
        "Let the wax harden for 30 seconds.",
        "As the wax cools, it hardens.",
        "Once it's hardened, it's easier to pull off.",
        "You'll know the wax has hardened enough to remove when you can tap your fingernail on it and it makes a tapping noise, similar to hard plastic.",
        "Rip the hardened wax off in the opposite direction of hair growth.",
        "Hold the skin taut with your non-dominant hand.",
        "Grab onto the \u201ctab\u201d at the end of the hardened wax with your dominant hand.",
        "Brace yourself!",
        "Then quickly pull the wax off in the opposite direction of hair growth.",
        "It's going to sting a bit \u2013 there's just no getting around that \u2013 but it'll get easier with time and practice.",
        "Try to pull the wax off in one smooth motion, similar to ripping off a bandage.",
        "Resist the urge to pull the hair straight up.",
        "Always pull in the opposite direction of hair growth.",
        "Continue applying wax systematically in small sections.",
        "Take short breaks whenever you need to in between sections.",
        "Don't try to get it over with quickly by waxing large swaths of skin!",
        "You won't effectively remove the hair from the area and it will actually hurt even more.",
        "Continue working in sections approximately 1 in (2.5 cm) wide and 3 in (7.6 cm) long.",
        "Keep working diligently \u2013 you're almost there!",
        "Tweeze any stray hairs along your bikini line that the wax missed.",
        "Sterilize your tweezers first by wiping them down with a cotton ball moistened with rubbing alcohol.",
        "Use the tweezers to remove any stray hairs that didn't come away with the wax.",
        "Pluck them one at a time.",
        "Always tweeze hairs in the same direction as the hair growth for best results.",
        "Remove any wax residue with a post-wax cleanser.",
        "Once you're happy with your job, gently clean the area with baby oil or a post-wax cleanser.",
        "Waxing kits will typically come with specially formulated cleanser, which is another good reason to use one for your first waxing session.",
        "However, baby oil will also get the job done.",
        "Maintaining Your Bikini Line Apply an aloe vera gel to soothe just-waxed skin.",
        "After removing wax residue, gently apply a cooling aloe vera gel.",
        "This will soothe the irritated skin and lessen inflammation.",
        "The area will be a bit red and sore for a few hours, which is totally normal.",
        "Treat redness and swelling with a cortisone cream.",
        "If your bikini area is looking pretty inflamed, dab a small amount of over-the-counter cortisone cream on the area.",
        "A formula with 1% cortisone is usually best.",
        "Avoid direct sunlight on the area for 24 hours.",
        "If you have a beach or pool day planned, it's best to wax your bikini line the day before and give your skin a few hours to calm down first.",
        "The sun will worsen irritation of just-waxed skin, and salt water and chlorine will sting quite a bit.",
        "Exfoliate the area gently to keep ingrown hairs at bay.",
        "Exfoliating right after waxing isn't usually recommended, since the skin is very sensitive and a bit irritated.",
        "Once tenderness subsides (within a day or 2), use a gentle exfoliating scrub on the area while you're in the shower.",
        "Rub gently in circular motions and rinse the area thoroughly.",
        "Wax the area every 3 to 4 weeks, as needed.",
        "Try to come up with a routine waxing schedule and stick to it.",
        "If you go longer than 3 or 4 weeks, your hair will be too long and waxing will be more painful.",
        "Staying on a strict waxing cycle also helps your skin build tolerance to the pain.",
        "Don't wax before your period.",
        "This is when you are the most sensitive to pain."
