The connectors at the other end of the same L/R audio cable should be plugged into the matching Audio Out ports on the back of the DVR. You'll need to insert the red plug into the red Audio Out Right port and the white plug into the white Audio Out Left port. Turn the equipment back on. The DVR and TV should now be connected. Turn both pieces of equipment back on and switch the TV to the necessary input source to watch content from the DVR. Scroll through the input options by pressing the \"Source\" or \"Input\" button on your TV or remote control. Stop once a picture appears on the TV screen. Usually, this will be the \"Video\" option. Method Four: S-Video Cable Turn off the equipment. If the TV and DVR are currently on, turn them both off before making any connections. You can keep both devices plugged into the wall outlet or power strip while connecting them, but the devices must remain off until the end of the process. Connect the S-video cable to the TV. You'll need to use a standard S-video cable for the video. Plug one end of the cable into the S-video In port on the back of the TV. Connect the other end of the S-video cable to the DVR. Plug the other end of the same S-video cable into the S-video Out port on the back of your DVR. Attach the audio cable to the TV. You'll need to use a separate L/R stereo cable for the audio. Connect the plugs at one end of this cable into the matching Audio In ports on the back of the TV.
