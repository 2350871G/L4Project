Fill the wells in the muffin tin three-quarters of the way full. A good way to do this would be with a tablespoon or with an ice cream scoop. This way, you can ensure that every well gets the same amount of batter. You'll also be less likely to spill and waste batter. Bake the brownies for 22 to 26 minutes. They are ready when they start to pull away from the sides of the tin. Another way to test for doneness is to touch the top; they are done if they spring back slightly. If you are baking these in a mini muffin tin, they will take about 16 minutes to bake. You might want to check from for doneness after about 10 minutes, however. Let the brownies cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then take them out. At this point, you can serve them on a plate, or let them finish cooling the rest of the way on a wire cooling rack. Finished. ",
