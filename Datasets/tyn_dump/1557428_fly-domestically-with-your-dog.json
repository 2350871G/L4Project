        "Take down the numbers of local vets at the place you land at to be able to quickly treat your dog if it was hurt in the flight.",
        "Take your dog for a walk and play with it when you land.",
        "Your dog will likely be stressed from being in an enclosed space in a harsh environment away from you.",
        "Take your dog for a good walk and play with it outside of the carrier until you are sure that it is a little more relaxed and recovered from the experience.",
        "Bring some of its favorite toys to play with, as these will be a reminder of something familiar that will help to bring your dog back to earth, so to say.",
        "Change out the puppy pads, feed your dog, and re-fill the water in the carrier.",
        "Before you leave for your destination after landing, be sure to change out any soiled absorbent padding, re-fill your dog's water bottle, and give it a little food to settle its stomach.",
        "Don't feed it too much, as it may still be a little uneasy after the flight."
