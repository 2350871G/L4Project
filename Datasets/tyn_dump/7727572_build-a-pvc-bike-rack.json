With moderate pressure, rub the sandpaper over the cut edges of the PVC to remove plastic burrs and sharp edges. It shouldn\u2019t take too much effort to sand away burrs and sharp edges. Avoid over sanding, as this can shorten the overall length of your PVC. If you\u2019re using especially durable PVC, it may be easier to use a metal file instead of sandpaper. Pass the file back and forth over the PVC until sharpness and burrs are removed."

Follow this with a quick pass from a clean, lint-free dry cloth and you\u2019re ready to move on. Small bits of PVC knocked loose from sanding can get stuck in PVC cement (glue), resulting in a bike rack frame that fits together poorly. PVC burrs are easily tracked through the home and can cause splinters. Take care to vacuum up all PVC shavings in your work area."

The second set of T-connectors should be oriented in the same fashion as the first, so that the stem of the T points inward at a 45\u00b0 angle. Join the left and right sides together. Both sides of the PVC frame should be positioned so that each elbow joint is facing an opposing elbow joint. Leave a little more than a foot (30.5 cm) of space between each side. Connect the four elbow joints with two 12 in (30.5 cm) PVC pieces. Finishing the Rack Put together the bike mounts. Connect two pieces of 24 in (61 cm) long PVC with a 90\u00b0 elbow joint to form a V shape. Make a total of four of these Vs.
