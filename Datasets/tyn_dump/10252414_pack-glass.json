Usually packing paper provides enough protection, but you can fortify the glass with an additional layer of bubble wrap. Since bubble wrap is bulky, make sure you have enough space in your box for it! Glass vases are wrapped the same way as glassware. However, the size of many vases means you need to move them into a separate box or storage container."

You can also use objects like Styrofoam, paint buckets, plate racks, or fabrics to provide extra support. When you lay plates flat in a box, they tend to move around a lot.

Since a box of glass can get very heavy, the extra wall ensures that the box doesn't fall apart when you lift it. Corrugated simply refers to how the box is made. Pretty much all shipping containers are corrugated. To make sure a box is corrugated, examine its edges. A corrugated box has a wavy layer of cardboard between 2 flat sheets. A double wall box will have a second layer of wavy and flat cardboard. Most regular, medium-sized cardboard boxes are fine to use, but make sure they aren't damaged and avoid overpacking them. These boxes will likely be single wall corrugated cardboard."

Instead, rest them against the side of the box. Lean additional plates and bowls against them. Each item should be individually wrapped to provide plenty of cushioning. If you have cell dividers big enough for plates, great. You can also use objects like Styrofoam, paint buckets, plate racks, or fabrics to provide extra support. When you lay plates flat in a box, they tend to move around a lot. Plates bumping together can lead to breakage. Also, the bottom plate may end up getting crushed. Similarly, avoid laying table tops and mirrors flat. Lay them against a wall, keeping heavy items away from them. Fit a layer of bubble wrap between rows of items. Doing this is useful if you have enough space to stack items in multiple rows or layers. Try to squeeze the bubble wrap between the items to prevent them from bumping into one another. If you don't have enough space for bubble wrap, you may be able to use packing tape, packing peanuts, fabric, or other buffers. Sometimes you can fit similar pieces of glassware over each other. Wrap the lower piece before putting it inside the bowl of the other piece, for instance. Place another layer of balled newspaper above the glass. Crumple up 9 to 12 more newspaper sheets and drop them over the glass. This fills the top half of the box, providing impact resistance in case it is turned upside down. Add more paper as needed if you notice any empty space remaining in the box. Newspaper works well, but you can also use other packing material. Line the box with bubble wrap, blankets, or clothing if you prefer. Shake the box and listen for any signs of movement. Now comes the true test of your packing abilities. Give the box a good rattle to see if the glass bumps into anything. If you hear glass colliding into anything, whether it's other glass or the cardboard itself, your package isn't quite ready yet. Open it and fill it with more packing material. Look for any items that are packed too loosely. Rewrap them as needed. Consider adding a layer of bubble wrap or other packing material. If you see space in the box, fill it! Stuff in some bubble wrap, packing peanuts, or any other soft material you can think of. Close the box and tape it shut. Fold the top flaps over the box, then position the side flaps on top of them. Find your packing tape and seal up this end of the box. Seal the flaps together with a few layers of tape, then, for good measure, tape over the box's seams a few times. Tape across the center of the box and flaps to provide extra stability. Label the box with a dark marker. Use a black permanent marker to label the box. First, write \u201cfragile\u201d in big letters on the top of the box. Then, label the box so you know what is in it. Finally, write \u201cthis side up\u201d so anyone who touches the box knows how to handle it safely. For instance, you might write \u201ckitchen glasses\u201d on the box. This emphasizes that the box has delicate glasses in it, and it will also help you locate the box after it is moved. Finding and Choosing Cardboard Boxes Use double wall corrugated cardboard boxes to pack glass. These are the sturdiest cardboard boxes you can get. Since a box of glass can get very heavy, the extra wall ensures that the box doesn't fall apart when you lift it. Corrugated simply refers to how the box is made. Pretty much all shipping containers are corrugated. To make sure a box is corrugated, examine its edges. A corrugated box has a wavy layer of cardboard between 2 flat sheets. A double wall box will have a second layer of wavy and flat cardboard. Most regular, medium-sized cardboard boxes are fine to use, but make sure they aren't damaged and avoid overpacking them. These boxes will likely be single wall corrugated cardboard. Get dish barrel boxes to organize glass into separate cells. Like the name suggests, these boxes are thick and strong to protect glass. Dividers section each box into separate compartments. Set a single glass item in each cell to give it the maximum amount of protection. Companies that ship glass bottles or glassware often use this type of box, although a lot of shipping companies also sell them. Sometimes you can buy the cell dividers separately, then slide them into a cardboard box you already have. Purchase boxes from a moving company. Moving and shipping companies deal with packed boxes every day, so you know you can get all your supplies from them. Bring a list of the items you need to pack or figure out how many boxes you need. They will sell you both regular corrugated boxes and dish barrel boxes. They also may sell packing paper, packing tape, and bubble wrap, so consider getting all your supplies at the same time. If you have any problems packing your glass, ask the employees for tips. This can be especially helpful for large or oddly-shaped pieces such as table tops. Buy boxes and other moving supplies from retail stores. Various retail locations sell packing supplies. General stores often sell supplies, along with office supply stores and even some home improvement stores. The selection may not be as large as what a moving company offers, but general retail can be a way to get what you need all at once. You can also order boxes and other supplies online, although this won't help you too much if you need to pack in a hurry. Ask other people for packing boxes they no longer need. Plenty of shipping containers are used every day, so you might as well take advantage of them! If you know someone who has completed a move, ask for their leftover boxes. A lot of retail locations throw away their boxes and will let you take them for free if you ask as well. To find available boxes in your area, look on https://www.freecycle.org/. Liquor stores are a good place to find strong boxes, as are book stores. However, don't overlook grocery stores, fast food stops, and other general retailers.",
