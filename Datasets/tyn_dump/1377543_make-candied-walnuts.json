Preparing Brown Sugar Candied Walnuts Heat the butter in a large pan. Add 2 tablespoons (28 g) of butter to a large skillet, and heat it on medium. Allow the butter to melt completely, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes. The butter will melt more quickly if you cut it into pieces before adding it to the pan. Mix in the walnuts, brown sugar, and cinnamon, and cook. When the butter is melted, stir 2 cups (216 g) of shelled walnuts, \u00bd cup (100 g) of brown sugar, and 2 teaspoons (4 g) of ground cinnamon into the pan. Let the mixture heat on medium until the sugar dissolves, which should take approximately 3 to 4 minutes. Be sure to stir the mixture constantly as you\u2019re waiting for the sugar to melt so it doesn\u2019t burn and the nuts don\u2019t stick together. Remove the nuts from the pan and allow to cool.
