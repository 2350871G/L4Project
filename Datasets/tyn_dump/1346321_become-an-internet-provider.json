Some data centers also sell a strong Internet connection called Dedicated Internet Access you can use instead of fiber cables to power your business. To find out where fiber cables are, search for fiber optic Internet providers in your area. Ask them about their network and if it reaches your potential data center. Also, speak with the building\u2019s property owner and any other tenants for more information. If the data center location isn\u2019t near quality fiber lines, you will need to pay an Internet service provider for an installation. Doing this is expensive, so you are better off finding a place that already has a good upstream fiber connection."

Drive around your neighborhood and use online maps to identify potential spots to lease. Radio towers, water towers, hills, mountains, tall buildings, and even some homes are great spots to consider. Visit these locations in person to get a good view of the scenery. You need to be able to see your customer\u2019s home from the tower or else the signal won\u2019t reach them. Hills, trees, and other buildings may make this difficult. Aim on servicing about 50 customers for each relay tower. Expect to lose money if you put relays in areas without many homes. Big ISPs avoid rural communities for this reason. Relay towers spread wireless signals. To create faster Internet connections when towers are far apart, you can lay fiber optic cables in the ground. Creating a fiber optic network is extremely expensive, so most people stick to wireless technology."

Find the best spot to run a wire from the CPE to your user\u2019s network equipment. To do this, use a stud finder to locate the beams holding the wall upright. Position the hole at least 3 in (7.6 cm) from the studs. Using a masonry bit 18 in (46 cm) long and \u20448 in (0.95 cm) in diameter, drill all the way through the wall. Look for spots other ISPs, telephone companies, and cable companies used to get wires into the home. You may be able to use these spots to wire the equipment without drilling. Be aware of any live wires in the wall. Use a stud finder with AC wire detection to identify problems to avoid with your drill. Always ask your customer before installing or drilling anything. Explain the installation process to them. Get their approval. Run weatherproof cables from the CPE into your customer\u2019s home. Use the same CAT5e cables you used at your relay points. Keep the cable tight against the home by securing it to the gutter with zip ties or cable clips. Bring the cable down the wall, then thread it through the hole you drilled. Have a friend help with the cable to make the installation much easier. Instruct them to look for the cable and fish it out while you push it into the hole you drilled. Connect the antenna cable to a switch or router. Power over Ethernet (PoE) switches are the easiest devices to hook up inside homes. You will need to plug the antenna cable into a wall jack. Then, use a shielded patch cable to plug the switch or router into the jack. Connect the switch or router to a wall outlet to power it. For simpler installations, provide routers and modems for your customers. If you don\u2019t do this, tell customers what devices are compatible with your service. Each customer will need to get their own modem to enable Internet access and their own router to enable Wi-Fi. Connect a laptop to the switch to finish the installation. If you installed the antenna correctly, you will be able to detect your ISP signal through your computer\u2019s software. Use the software to install antenna firmware updates, change the access password, and set the customer\u2019s unique IP address. Before locking the antenna in place, use the software to adjust its positioning to receive your network\u2019s signal as much as possible. Test the Internet connection before you leave. Log into the Internet on your laptop. Make sure the connection is fast and stable. Setting up an ISP Business Create a business plan to organize your goals and finances. A comprehensive business plan keeps you organized as you set up your ISP. In a good business plan, you describe your goals as an ISP, how you will provide service to customers, and how much you will charge for it. Also, describe how much money you need to start, how many employees you will hire, and how you will deal with problems like maintenance issues. You need a good plan if you intend on selling your service as an ISP. While you don\u2019t need it for a private service, having a plan is still useful. Banks look for good business plans when giving out loans. Since becoming an ISP is expensive, have a good plan to secure funding. Check your local rules for setting up a new ISP. Every country in the world has its own unique rules determining how ISPs operate. States and cities may also create their own guidelines, so be sure to visit the closest government office for advice. In many places, you can set up your own ISP without much legal trouble. Keep in mind that national ISPs operate in most areas. In some countries,  you may not even be allowed to set up a new ISP business. Get a business license from the government if you plan on selling your service. Submit your licensing application to your government\u2019s business office. Get the application on your government\u2019s website or by visiting them in person. You will need to list your business\u2019 name, what it does, and how it operates. Then, wait 1 to 2 months to receive your license in the mail. You do not need to get a business license if you aren\u2019t selling your service to customers. Chances are no one will bother you if you set up a service only for you and people you know. Market your Internet service to potential customers. Most people already have an ISP. To compete with existing businesses, begin advertising. Purchase ads on local TV, buy ad space in newspapers and magazines, and send flyers to customers near your relay towers. Also, go door to door to explain what your service has to offer. Expect people to stick with their old ISP. Even if they aren\u2019t happy with their ISP, they may not feel motivated enough to make a change. Focus on the customers you have to grow your business. Maintain your equipment to keep your service running. Refer to your customer management program to keep tabs on your service. Cables and other equipment wear out over time. Sometimes components get damaged from bad weather, animals, or other accidents. Make repairs and buy new equipment as needed to keep your business profitable. If you have a good network tracking system, it will show you when something goes wrong with your network. Send out a technician as soon as possible for a repair.",
