Most high schools require you to take a class or two, but take more if you can. Begin building a portfolio that you can use to apply to college art programs and jobs. Once you\u2019ve mastered the basics, enter any advanced drawing classes your school offers. Ask about independent studies.

An example of a satirical comment is someone saying \u201cI\u2019m still undecided\u201d after they\u2019ve voted in an important election. It takes practice to get the right subject matter and tone, since you need to be sharp and intelligent instead of mean-spirited or obscene.
