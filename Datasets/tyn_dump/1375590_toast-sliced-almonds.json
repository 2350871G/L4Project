        "If you're not using the almonds right away, store them in a sealable plastic bag to preserve their flavor and texture.",
        "They will retain their texture and flavor for up to 2 weeks.",
        "Use the sliced almonds as a topping or eat them alone.",
        "Toasted sliced almonds are very tasty and versatile and can be used in a wide variety of dishes.",
        "They can add color, texture, and flavor when sprinkled on top of salads, desserts and even pizza.",
        "Eat them on their own as a quick and healthy snack.",
        "Drizzle them in a little olive oil and sprinkle them with salt first, if you like.",
        "Mix them into cake, bread, and muffin batters.",
        "Toasted almonds are less likely to sink to the bottom than regular almonds.",
        "Store the nuts in an airtight container for a maximum of 2 weeks.",
        "They will still be safe to eat after 2 weeks but will start to lose their texture and flavor.",
        "If you plan to store the almond slices immediately after toasting them, make sure you\u2019ve allowed them to cool completely before storing.",
        "You can also freeze the nuts, which will keep them fresh for up to 3 months.",
        "Using a Toaster Oven Spread up to 1 cup (240 mL) of almonds on your toaster oven tray.",
        "Depending on the size of your toaster oven, you may need to use a smaller amount of sliced almonds.",
        "Make sure the nuts are spread evenly with minimal overlap, to ensure that they toast evenly.",
        "Consider lining your tray in foil for easier cleanup.",
        "However, make sure to check the instructions for your specific toaster model first, to confirm that it\u2019s equipped to handle aluminum foil.",
        "Set the toaster oven to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) and place the tray inside.",
        "The process for toasting almonds in a toaster oven is very similar to toasting in a regular oven.",
        "The major difference is that the heating elements are much closer to the almonds in a toaster oven, meaning that they can burn more easily.",
        "Keep a close eye on the almonds throughout the entire process to make sure they don\u2019t burn!",
        "Bake the almond slices for 3-4 minutes, then stir.",
        "Open the toaster oven and use a wooden spoon or spatula to stir and flip the almond slices.",
        "This will ensure they cook evenly.",
        "Then, close the toaster oven door.",
        "You can also shake the tray to redistribute the nuts.",
        "If you use this method, make sure to use hot pads to avoid burning yourself on the hot tray.",
        "Repeat in 1-minute intervals until the nuts are golden-brown.",
        "Make sure to stir or shake the almonds each minute to keep them toasting evenly.",
        "Depending on your toaster oven and the amount of nuts you\u2019re cooking, it could take anywhere from 5-10 minutes.",
        "The almonds will be done when they begin releasing a rich, nutty fragrance and appear golden-brown.",
        "Pour the nuts into another container and let them cool.",
        "Remove the tray from the toaster oven, then transfer the nuts to a bowl or another tray.",
        "This prevents the nuts from continuing to cook on the hot metal tray.",
        "Let the nuts sit for at least 15 minutes to fully cool.",
        "Store the nuts for up to 2 weeks.",
        "Toasted almonds can be kept in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.",
        "After that point, they will still be safe to eat but will start to lose their texture and flavor.",
        "Heating Sliced Almonds on the Stovetop Place a saut\u00e9 pan on the stove over medium heat.",
        "Use a heavy-bottomed pan for best results.",
        "Make sure you have your ingredients within arms' reach before you turn on the heat.",
        "For this method, you\u2019ll need \u20442 cup (120 mL) of sliced almonds and, optionally, a small amount of butter or coconut oil.",
        "Add a small amount of butter to increase flavor if desired.",
        "Toss a small pat of butter or a dash of coconut oil in the pan and allow it to heat up for roughly 1 minute.",
        "It\u2019s not necessary to grease the pan, but adding butter or coconut oil can enhance the flavor of the almonds.",
        "Shake the pan a bit to let the melted butter or oil coat the bottom.",
        "Pour \u20442 cup (120 mL) of almonds into the preheated pan.",
        "Once the pan heats up, sprinkle the almonds across the pan in an even layer.",
        "This method works best for smaller amounts of nuts.",
        "Try to keep the slices from bunching up in one section of the pan, which will prevent them from toasting evenly.",
        "Stir or shake the pan every 30 seconds.",
        "Use a wooden spoon to stir, or simply shake the pan using the handle.",
        "This will prevent the nuts from burning.",
        "As they start to cook, you will see a small amount of moisture forming on top of the almonds.",
        "This is the oil being released from the nuts by heat, which will create a rich, nutty flavor.",
        "Although the stovetop method is quick and easy, the almond slices tend to roast a little unevenly.",
        "It's important to keep the almonds moving.",
        "If the pan you are using has a metal handle, make sure to use an oven mitt when shaking to avoid burning your hand.",
        "Turn off the heat when the almonds develop browned edges.",
        "The almonds should take between 3 and 5 minutes to toast on the stovetop.",
        "Remove the almonds from the heat when they begin to smell fragrant, but before they start to fully brown.",
        "Once the almonds brown, it\u2019s likely that they will burn.",
        "Pour the toasted almond slices into another dish to cool.",
        "Transfer the toasted almonds to a bowl or tray immediately, to keep them from cooking further in the heated pan.",
        "Allow them to cool for roughly 15 minutes.",
        "Use the almonds immediately or store them for up to 2 weeks.",
        "You can store the nuts on the counter or in the fridge for 1-2 weeks.",
        "Make sure they are stored in an airtight container.",
        "If you freeze the nuts, they will last anywhere from 1-3 months.",
        "Cooking Sliced Almonds in the Microwave Spread up to 1 cup (240 mL) of sliced almonds on a microwave-safe plate.",
        "Arrange them in a single layer with minimal overlap.",
        "Do not grease the plate.",
        "Place the plate into the microwave.",
        "Add a small amount of margarine, butter, or oil if desired.",
        "Use approximately  \u20442 teaspoon (2.5 mL) of butter or oil per 1/2 teaspoon fat per \u20442 cup (120 mL) of nuts.",
        "Stir the almonds together with the oil or butter so they are thinly coated.",
        "Make sure the butter has been softened before trying to stir it in with the almonds.",
        "Adding a small amount of fat to the nuts will encourage browning and make the toasting process happen more quickly.",
        "Microwave the almonds on high for 1 minute, then stir.",
        "Set the microwave to its highest power setting, and cook the sliced almonds for 1 minute.",
        "Take them out of the microwave and stir them with a spoon.",
        "Then, return the plate to the microwave.",
        "Stirring the almonds redistributes them and ensures they toast evenly.",
        "Repeat in 1-minute intervals until the nuts are golden-brown and fragrant.",
        "Aim to remove the almonds from the microwave just before they start to brown and become fragrant.",
        "This should take 3-5 minutes, depending on your microwave's power.",
        "All microwaves cook differently, so keep a close eye on your nuts as they cook.",
        "If you have an older model, it may take longer to toast the almonds.",
        "Make sure to stir the almonds at each 1-minute interval to make sure they toast evenly.",
        "Allow the nuts to cool, then use or store them for 1-2 weeks.",
        "As long as they are stored in an airtight container, the toasted almonds will be good for up to 2 weeks.",
        "They can be kept in the fridge or at room temperature.",
        "If you want the nuts to keep for longer, store them in the freezer.",
        "Frozen almond slices can last for up to 3 months."
