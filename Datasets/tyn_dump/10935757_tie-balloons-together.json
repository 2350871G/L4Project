You\u2019ll be using the necks to tie the rest of the cluster, so be sure to keep them as long as possible. For more symmetrical clusters,  try to blow all of your balloons up to roughly the same size. Alternatively, you can inflate them to different sizes for more of a varied look. The number of balloons you use is up to you\u2014you can easily cluster up to 5 together using their necks."

Cross one neck over the other, then continue wrapping it all the way around twice. Tie the two necks together using a half knot to secure the balloons. A half knot is the same kind of over-under knot you would use to start tying your shoelaces.

Finally, grip one balloon from each duplet on both sides and twist the pairs in opposite directions twice until the balloons lay flat. If you want, you can also give the duplets another half twist to give your quad more of a three-dimensional shape. Use 2 balloons of the same color to make your duplets, but choose a different color for each duplet. As a result, your finished cluster will have a balanced two-tone look."

As you do, the necks will twist together, joining the balloons tight. Theoretically, you could continue tying duplets to triplets in this way to make your cluster bigger and bigger until you run out of room for more balloons. Bookend a cluster of 5 patterned balloons with a duplet in a plain color to make a lovely balloon flower."
