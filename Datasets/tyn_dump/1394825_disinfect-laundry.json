Check your items\u2019 care labels to determine how hot the water you wash them in can be, and use that setting on your washing machine. Hot water, measuring 140 to 194 degrees Fahrenheit (60 to 90 degrees Celsius) is typically only used for white items. Colored items should be washed in cooler water, typically measuring between 86 and 104 degrees Fahrenheit (30 to 40 degrees Celsius).
