To find out how much felt you need, measure yourself from wrist to wrist with your arms stretched out. Next, measure the distance from the top of your back to your waist. Use these measurements to choose a rectangular piece of felt. If you want to make a more feminine bat costume, use a long-sleeve dress instead of a shirt and pants. Felt can be found at most craft supply stores. If you use another kind of fabric you will have to use a sewing kit to attach the wings."
