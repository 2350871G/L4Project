The range of telescopes available is huge, but for beginners a 60 or 70mm refractor telescope is a good place to start. The performance of your telescope will drop if the optics are not sufficiently cooled. Keep it in a relatively cool place, and before you want to start viewing place it outside so its temperature can drop before you begin."

Ask yourself if the stars are twinkling brightly through the sky. If so, this suggests that there is a turbulent atmosphere.

The Association of Lunar and Planetary Observers (ALPO) has a scale for seeing conditions which goes from 0 to 10. If the conditions score lower than a 5, your chances of a good observation are very slim."
