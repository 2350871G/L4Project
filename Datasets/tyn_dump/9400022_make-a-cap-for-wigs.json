How you braid your hair now is very important, because it will affect the size and shape of the wig cap. You need to take a mold of your head in order to modify the wig head. If you don\u2019t do this, the cap for your wig will not fit you.

Extending the plastic wrap past your hairline will reduce the chances of the tape sticking to your hair in the later steps. Use clear plastic wrap, if you can. It will make the later steps easier. If you have a nylon wig cap to wear under your wig, it would be a good idea to put it on first. If the plastic wrap is slipping around too much, secure it to your forehead with a piece of scotch tape."

There should be no soft spots left. If you feel a soft spot, that means you missed the plastic wrap. Cover it with a piece of tape! The taped plastic will have some give to it, which is fine.

        "If you still can\u2019t get the plastic off, carefully cut a slit into it (preferably the back), then slide it off.",
        "If you put a nylon wig cap earlier, it may come off with the plastic wrap mold.",
        "Simply peel it away.",
        "Use a pair of scissors to cut off the excess tape and plastic wrap.",
        "Follow the line that you drew with a marker, leaving a \u20442 to 1 in (1.3 to 2.5 cm) border.",
        "Make sure that you cut out the ears as well.",
        "When you are done, you should have a cap that fits perfectly on your head, and follows your hairline and ears.",
        "Reinforce the inside of the plastic mold with more tape.",
        "If you cut a slit into the mold, you will need to close it up and tape it first.",
        "Next, cut off smaller pieces of tape, and use them to cover the inside of the mold, overlapping them as you go.",
        "If you want a nicer finish, you can wrap tape around the cut edges of the cap.",

        "You can do this with polyester stuffing, paper towels, or even cotton pads.",
        "How much you pad it depends on how big your head is compared to the wig head.",
        "Most Styrofoam wig heads are small, so you may need to pad your mold a lot.",
        "If you choose to use paper towels or even pieces of paper, be sure to crush them and not fold them.",
        "This will make it easier to insert the pins later on.",
        "Slide the head mold onto the wig head, and add more padding if needed.",
        "Slip the mold with the padding onto the wig head.",
        "It should be padded enough to feel firm when you touch it, without a lot of give.",

        "You can buy weaving nets online and from shops that sell wig making supplies.",
        "If you are buying netting from a fabric store, you need enough to drape over your head and cover the hairline, plus a few inches/centimeters extra.",
        "You can also use French lace, or other types of lace used for wig making.",
        "If you will be ventilating your wig, you should get ventilating lace.",
        "Pull the netting taut across the forehead and secure it with sewing pins.",

        "You need a pin in front of and behind each ear hole.",
        "Make sure that the lace is going past the hairline.",
        "If it isn\u2019t, it is either off-center or too narrow.",
        "If the lace is too narrow, you will need to cut a larger piece and start again.",
        "If the lace is off-center, you need to re-position it and re-pin it.",
        "Pinch the netting to create darts and a tighter fit.",
        "You will need to create a dart in front and behind each ear.",

        "Do not remove the pins holding the darts together.",
        "Do not remove the mold you pinned earlier to the wig head.",
        "Sew the darts using the pins you inserted as a guide.",
        "You can do this on a sewing machine, a serger, or by hand.",
        "If you are using a sewing machine, be sure to backstitch at the start and end of your sewing.",
        "Remove the pins as you sew, and make sure to use a thread color that matches the lace.",
        "Cut down the seams.",
        "If you sewed the darts on a sewing machine or by hand, you will still have triangular flaps sticking out of the seams.",
        "Cut these down until the seams are \u20444 to \u20442 inch (0.64 to 1.27 cm) wide.",
        "Skip this step if you used a serger, as the machine will have already done this for you.",
        "Go over the raw edges using a zigzag stitch, if desired.",
        "You don\u2019t have to do this, especially if you used a serger, but it will give you a nicer finish.",
        "Remember to use a matching thread color and to backstitch (if you are using a sewing machine).",

        "At this point, you can trim off the excess lace to match the hairline.",
        "You can also hem the lace, as desired, or sew in an elastic.",
