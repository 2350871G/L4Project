The oils in the nut will naturally fill in and darken the scratched area, lending the exposed raw wood a finished look. This technique works well for quickly minimizing the appearance of small surface imperfections. Fill in Numerous Small Surface Scratches Obtain some paste wax and steel wool. If you have a wood surface that is covered in many small scratches, you can touch them up using paste wax, which is sometimes sold as \"finishing wax.\" The wax is best applied using No. 0000 steel wool. Apply the paste wax across the entire wood surface. Place a small dab of the wax onto the steel wool and apply it in smooth, circular motions. Aim to apply as thin a layer of wax as possible to avoid a finished appearance that is hazy or splotchy. Allow the wax to dry onto the wood furniture. After applying the wax, give it about 30 minutes to dry. Longer times may be required in cold or humid rooms. Buff the paste wax into the wood. Use a soft cloth to buff the wood surface, removing excess wax and lending a lustrous sheen to the wood. The small surface scratches will be filled in with the wax and will be minimized in appearance. Repair Deep Scratches in Wood Furniture Purchase a wax stick. Wax sticks can be purchased at hardware stores, where they are sold for use in patching deep scratches and gouges in wood furniture. They are often available in multiple shades, so you should try to match the wax stick to the wood's existing finish. Run the wax stick along the gouge. Applying firm pressure, run the wax stick lengthwise along the deep scratch. As you do this, the scratch should fill in with wax. You may need to make several passes for very deep or awkwardly shaped gouges. Remove the excess wax from the scratch. When the cut is completely filled with wax, drag a putty knife (or the edge of a credit card) across the surface of the wood to remove any wax that is sitting above the surface. Allow the wax to dry and then buff it with a soft cloth. Touch Up Scratches in Glass Furniture Prepare a scratch removal compound. You can minimize the appearance of scratches in glass tabletops or cabinet doors by buffing a scratch removal compound into them. Make this compound by mixing together 2 tablespoons (30 ml) each of jeweler's rouge (can be purchased from a jeweler), glycerin (can be purchase from a pharmacy), and tap water. Stir these ingredients together in a small bowl. Rub the compound into the scratched glass. Use a soft cloth to gently rub the compound over the scratch using smooth, circular motions. Do this for about 30 seconds, and then allow the compound to dry into the scratch for another 30 seconds. Wash away the scratch removal compound. You can wash the compound away using mild soap and water. Note that the scratch will begin to reappear in the glass after about 6 months, after which you can reapply the compound if desired.
