If you want to catch a few dozen crickets, a cup of sugar and a cup of breadcrumbs should be plenty. Don't use spicy or flavored breadcrumbs. Plain breadcrumbs are best for catching crickets, and extra ingredients might deter them. You can mix up a big batch of sugar and breadcrumbs and store whatever is left over in a jar for later use. This way you can catch more crickets every few days. Sprinkle this mixture on the ground where you have seen crickets congregating. This method may be best to use outside, since sprinkling this mixture indoors may draw other pests, like roaches and mice. Sprinkle the mixture at dusk just before the nocturnal crickets will come out to play. Cover the mixture with a single layer of newspaper. Lay it out over the area where you sprinkled the sugar and breadcrumbs. Use no more than a single layer, since you want the crickets to be able to get underneath it. Choose a large jar with a lid for capturing the crickets. Get a big glass jar or a plastic container with a tight-fitting lid. Poke holes in the lid if you want to keep the crickets alive once you catch them. There are special containers you can use for storing live crickets. Visit a bait store to check out their options, or look online and order one. You can sprinkle some of the sugar and bread mixture in the jar to keep the crickets fed. Return in the morning before the dew dries. This is prime time for catching crickets. Their bellies will be full and they'll be calmly waiting for you under the layer of newspaper. If you wait until the sun dries the dew, the crickets will have time to hop away. Lift the newspaper and sweep the crickets into the container. You can use a scoop or a small brush to nudge them into the container. Place the lid on tightly once you've caught your crickets. Catching Crickets with a Soft Drink Bottle Cut off the the top of a 2-liter soda bottle. Use a sharp knife to cut around the circumference of the bottle. Be sure to hold the bottle tightly with one hand so the knife doesn't slip. Invert the top and place it inside the bottle. The pour spout should be pointing to the bottom of the bottle, and the cap should be removed. Use duct tape to seal the top edge of the bottle. Sprinkle sugar into the bottom through the spout. Keep sprinkling until you have a fine layer of sugar at the bottom of the bottle. Place the bottle on its side in a spot where you have seen crickets. You can use this method either indoors or outdoors. The crickets will crawl through the spout to reach the sugar, and a surprising number of them will be unable to find the hole to get back out. Return in the early morning to collect your crickets. Move them to a sealed container to store them for later use. Catching Crickets with Duct Tape Place a strip of duct tape sticky side up where you have seen crickets congregating. Common areas are on the floor along the baseboards or on windowsills in rooms where you suspect crickets are hiding. This method works best indoors, since tape placed outside will collect dirt, leaves and other creatures. Return to the tape the next day. The crickets will get caught in the glue as they try to walk across, making it easy for you to pick up and dispose of them. A more expensive option would be to use the sticky traps or \"motels\" made for catching roaches. Catching Crickets with a Cardboard Tube Place a small amount of food in a cardboard tube. Use the type of tube that comes with paper towels or bathroom tissue. The longer the tube, the more crickets you'll be able to catch. Place the tubes in areas where you suspect crickets might be hiding. This works well along baseboards and windowsills. Return early the next morning to collect the crickets. Place them in a sealed container with holes in the top for storage. Catching Crickets with a Loaf of Bread Slice a long loaf of bread in half lengthwise. Pre-sliced bread won't work for this method; you'll need to get a loaf of uncut bread. Hollow out the 2 sides. Use a spoon to dig a hole into both sides of bread. Place the bread you scoop out int a bowl. Mix some of the bread you removed with granulated sugar. Use equal parts sugar and bread. Place the mixture in one of the hollowed-out halves. Scoop in as much as you can fit. Replace the top and hold the loaf together with rubber bands or toothpicks. You could also wrap the entire thing around the middle with duct tape or plastic wrap. Slice off the ends of the bread. This exposes the hollowed-out section so the crickets can get inside. Place the bread in cricket territory. In the morning, you should have a full loaf of crickets.",
