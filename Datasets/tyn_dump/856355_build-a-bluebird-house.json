        "If you're cutting wood on your own, start with 12.25 in (31.1 cm) tall side pieces and mark the spot 1.5 in (3.8 cm) down from the top on each opposing side.",
        "Cut from the top of the tall side in a straight line down to the marked spot on the opposing side to create the angle.",
        "Use a ruler to draw a cutline from one 12.25 inch (31.1 cm) side to the opposing side 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) downward.",
        "Putting Your Bluebird House Together Create a 1.5\u20131.5625 inch (3.810\u20133.969 cm) entrance hole in the front piece.",
        "The hole should be placed 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the top of the wood and 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) from both sides.",
        "Use a spade bit, hole saw, or adjustable size hole bit with your drill to create the hole.",
        "For best results, drill the hole about 3/4 of the way through, flip the board, and finish the hole by drilling through the reverse side.",
        "For western bluebirds or eastern bluebirds, drill a 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) hole.",
        "For mountain bluebirds, create a 1.5625 inch (3.969 cm) hole.",
        "Create deep crisscrossed scratches on both sides of the panel.",
        "Use a chisel, nail, or knife to create crisscrossed scratches running from the entrance hole to the bottom on both sides of the front piece.",
        "This will give young birds traction to climb to the hole and easily leave the nest.",
        "It will also give the mother something to land on.",
        "Drill a \u20448 in (1.6 cm) ventilation holes in each of the side pieces.",
        "Each side piece's ventilation hole should be 1 in (2.5 cm) down from the top of the wood and 2 in (5.1 cm) from both sides.",
        "Attach a \u20448 in (1.6 cm) drill bit to your drill and apply downward pressure while pressing the trigger.",
        "Mark off the ventilation hole locations using a ruler and pencil.",
        "Hold the drill perpendicular to the wood as you create the holes.",
        "Glue the side pieces to the back piece.",
        "Apply a thin strip of glue vertically along the leftmost and rightmost sides of the back piece.",
        "Start from the top of the back piece and make the strips 12.25 inches (31.1 cm) long from top to bottom.",
        "Now, press the 12.25 inch (31.1 cm) end of each side piece onto the glue strips and hold them in place for 2 to 3 minutes.",
        "Each side piece should align as closely as possible to the top of the back piece.",
        "Be sure that the side pieces are perfectly perpendicular to the back piece before holding them in place onto the glue.",
        "Connect the side pieces to the back with screws.",
        "Drill four 2 inch (5.1 cm) holes with a twist bit horizontally through the back piece and into the side pieces.",
        "Each hole should go through the top-most and bottom-most part of each piece.",
        "Now, drive 4 exterior grade 2 inch (5.1 cm) screws through the holes.",
        "Place the sides onto a flat surface when attaching the screws.",
        "Hold each screw perpendicular to the wood and firmly but carefully drive them into the side pieces.",
        "Be sure that the sides are screwed flush.",
        "Drill a \u20448 inch (0.95 cm) ventilation hole in the bottom piece.",
        "Use a spade bit, a hole saw, or an adjustable size hole bit with your electric drill.",
        "Place the hole directly in the center of the piece.",
        "Cut the corners off the bottom piece.",
        "Use a ruler to draw a diagonal line \u20444 inch (1.9 cm) in from the edge of the wood.",
        "Afterward, use a circular saw to remove the corner pieces, taking care to cut at a 45-degree angle.",
        "The final shape of the wood is an octagon.",
        "Glue the bottom to the back and side pieces.",
        "Apply a line of glue onto the inside of the back and side pieces about \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) above the bottom of each piece.",
        "Now, press your 5 by 5 inch (13 cm \u00d7 13 cm) square bottom piece into place.",
        "Align the glue on the back and side pieces to the sides of the bottom piece as carefully as possible.",
        "Always keep the base \u20444 in (0.64 cm) above the bottom of the side pieces.",
        "Glue the front piece to the side pieces.",
        "Start by applying a strip of glue down each 10.75 in (27.3 cm) front edge \u20442 in (1.3 cm) from the top.",
        "Press the front piece against this glue, making sure that its edges are flush with the side pieces.",
        "Always leave a \u20442 in (1.3 cm) gap at the top of the front piece for proper ventilation.",
        "Screw the front piece to the side pieces.",
        "Start by drilling four 2 inch (5.1 cm) holes with your twist bit horizontally through the front piece into the side pieces.",
        "Each hole should go through the front piece into the corners of the side pieces.",
        "Finally, drive 4 exterior grade 2 inch (5.1 cm) screws through these holes.",
        "Glue and nail the roof onto the front piece and side pieces.",
        "Fasten the roof to the top of the front piece and the highest ends of the side pieces.",
        "Make sure there is a 2 inch (5.1 cm) overhang across the sides and a 3.75 inch (9.5 cm) overhang across the front.",
        "Start by attaching the roof with glue.",
        "Afterward, use a twist bit to create vertical holes down through the roof and into the side pieces.",
        "Finally, insert nails through the holes.",
        "If there is a crack at the rear of the top piece between the back piece, apply a line of caulking compound to seal it.",
        "This will help keep the rain out of the interior.",
        "Installing Your Bluebird House Keep each bluebird house at least 125 to 150 yards (114 to 137 m) from each other.",
        "If you install multiple homes, give them the recommended space.",
        "Without this space, you won't have enough nesting room for each bird, as bluebirds are territorial.",
        "If you decide to install bluebird houses in pairs next to each other, keep them 5 to 25 feet (1.5 to 7.6 m) apart.",
        "Mount your bluebird house 4 to 6 feet (1.2 to 1.8 m) high.",
        "Find a post to mount your bluebird house.",
        "Always make sure the entrance faces the nearest shrub or large tree.",
        "Try and install it in a location that is open or lightly wooded.",
        "For example, pastures with scattered trees or wooded patches are best.",
        "Other locations suitable for bluebird houses are cemeteries, golf courses, new sub-divisions, and farmsteads.",
        "Clean and repair bluebird houses every February.",
        "Outside of this, try to clean each bluebird house when the young have left.",
        "This will prepare the house for more young birds, as it is likely that adults will return to the box for additional broods.",
        "Young birds typically leave about 11 days after their eggs hatch."
