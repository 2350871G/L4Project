Pull out the insoles, sprinkle some baby powder inside of your shoes, and then put the insoles back in. The baby powder will help reduce the friction between your insoles and shoes so they don\u2019t squeak as much. If you don\u2019t have baby powder, you can use talcum powder or cornstarch instead. If your shoes don\u2019t have removable insoles, sprinkle the baby powder along the seams of the insoles instead of underneath them."

Putting a paper towel underneath your insoles will help prevent them from moving around and squeaking as much when you\u2019re walking. If you don\u2019t have paper towels available, try using napkins or dryer sheets instead.

Coconut oil can help lubricate your insoles so they\u2019re less likely to squeak when they move around. You only need to apply a thin layer of coconut oil to your shoes. You may need to reapply the oil if your shoes start squeaking again later on."
