Take advantage of these areas to maintain more control over your balance. The type of surface you play on doesn\u2019t make much of a difference, so go wherever you feel most comfortable.

When you\u2019re ready, put the ball on your foot, resting it against your leg. Test your positioning before placing the ball. Attempt to move your leg from side to side without shifting your foot\u2019s position. Keep your leg strong but your foot relaxed. Lock your ankle, not your knee!

If it goes to your left, move your foot to the left to bring the ball back to the center. Continue making adjustments to keep the ball on your foot for longer periods of time. The key to adjusting is slow, smooth motions. When you feel the ball moving, you may be tempted to swing your foot out quickly towards it. You end up overcompensating and losing control of the ball. Practice often to get a sense of how the ball moves and what you need to do to maintain your balance. Eliminate distractions, then focus on feeling the ball against your foot."
