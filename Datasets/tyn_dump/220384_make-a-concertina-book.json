Cut a piece of paper slightly larger than the cardboard and cut across the corners, gluing the paper to the card and over the edges. The paper needs to completely cover the inside edges but it is not necessary to cover the very middle because the folded papers will be glued on here. Fold a square piece of paper in half lengthwise.  Open the paper back up.  Fold the paper in half the other way.  Open the paper back up.  Turn the paper over.  Fold the paper diagonally, press the edge well and open out. Just do this on one diagonal, not both. Turn the paper over again and push the corners with the diagonal folds towards each other. When folded flat it will be a square a quarter the area of the whole piece. Repeat with all six pieces of paper.  Put the papers in the order you want to glue them on.  Put glue all over one square side of the paper. Try not to get any glue along the edges or it may make them stick together. Wipe any excess off. Place the glued side on to the wrong side of the cover centrally and press it down.  Press down hard so that it sticks! If you use a glue stick it should stay in place fairly quickly. Put glue on to the second piece of folded paper and position it on top of the first the same way round (IE. so that the corner with the \u2018flaps\u2019 is towards you). Turn the whole thing round 180 degrees so that the folded corner without the flaps is towards you and the corner with the flaps is away from you.
