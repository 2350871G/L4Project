Coffee with condensed milk is the most traditional way to drink Vietnamese coffee. Place coffee grounds with boiling water in a heatproof container for 4 minutes.

Enjoying Vietnamese Coffee Concoctions Try yogurt coffee for a little bit caffeine with your breakfast. Add a drizzle of strong, Vietnamese-brewed coffee to your morning yogurt for a caffeinated breakfast. Stir the coffee into the yogurt and drink it. Yogurt coffee is often topped with fresh fruit, like mango. Go for egg coffee for a sweet, rich dessert. Vietnamese egg coffee is a tiramisu-like dessert. Whisk one egg yolk with 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of sweetened, condensed milk until it becomes thick and frothy. Pour your coffee into a cup and top it with the egg mixture. Use a clear, glass cup to watch the egg mixture slowly dissolve into the hot coffee. Make a coffee smoothie for a modern caffeinated concoction. Coffee smoothies are becoming popular in Vietnam, since the sweetness of fruit balances out the bitterness of coffee. Try a mixture of banana, avocado, and coffee for a healthy, slightly sweet mixture, or sapodilla and coffee for a tropical, custardy taste.
