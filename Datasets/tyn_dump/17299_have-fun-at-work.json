Though metrics \u2014 believing you can write X amount of reports or talk to Y amount of clients in one week \u2014 can be a short-term motivator, having more meaningful goals, such as developing your communication skills or writing the most comprehensive report you\u2019ve ever written on a certain subject can help you think of your job in terms of a big picture. Having long term goals that feel meaningful instead of just like you\u2019re crunching numbers can definitely help make your workplace more fun for you. Write down your weekly work goals before you get to work on Monday, and work on setting monthly or even yearly goals. The more you have to strive toward, the more motivated you will feel. Believe it or not, setting goals and meeting them actually will make your work week much more fun!"

As long as it\u2019s okay with your boss, making an effort to make your work environment more fun, cheery, and sunny can really make a big difference on the fun factor of going to work. You can even ask if you can spruce up the common area in your workplace. Adding some funny posters, some gorgeous paintings, or some potted plants can make the workplace seem more homey and fun. Bring in activities that can make your office feel more communal. Bake cookies or bring in a partially-completed crossword puzzle and ask for help with it."

All of these activities will lead to more fun and friendly work environment. Another fun thing you can do with your coworkers is to join a volunteering organization together. This can help you contribute toward a good cause while bonding. If people in your office seem to like each other but are hesitant to start anything, then you can take the initiative to organize some social events.

Once you loosen up and take the time to smile at people or to look at the croissants someone brought in to the office, you\u2019ll be on your way to having more fun. When someone passes by, make a habit of looking up and saying hello and even having a quick conversation some of the time. This will make your work day more fun and exciting for sure.

You\u2019ll have much more fun at work if you come to think of your coworkers as your friends instead of your frenemies. If one of your co-workers hears that you\u2019ve been praising him or her, then he\u2019ll like you even more for it. Everybody wins. If you\u2019re in a conversation that is filled with gossip, you don\u2019t have to castigate people for it, but you can try to kindly excuse yourself, even if you just say you have to make a phone call real quick.

Instead of rushing to your desk and spending all day hanging out with your computer, make an effort to stop and chat with your co-workers every once in a while, even if it\u2019s a quick talk in the kitchen or in the hallway. Taking just a few minutes a day to talk to your co-workers won\u2019t really slow down your productivity and it\u2019ll actually make you have more fun when you come in to the office. The more you talk to people, the more you\u2019ll look forward to seeing friendly faces, and the more fun you\u2019ll have in the workplace. You don\u2019t have to be best friends with your co-workers to laugh and joke around with them a bit. Instead of sending an email or a Skype message to a co-worker who is working just a few feet away from you, make an effort to get up and talk to him or her in person. These small daily interactions will make for a more fun work day."

If you make a real effort to get to know your coworkers, to socialize with them outside of work, and to consider some of them your friends, you\u2019ll be able to have a lot more fun in the workplace because you\u2019ll be more excited to come in to work if you know your friends are there. Give your co-workers a chance and see which ones can be your real friends; as for the rest of them, work on building a friendly, healthy rapport with them. Don\u2019t make excuses for why you can\u2019t be friends with your co-workers; if you think that one person is too old, too young, or too wrapped up in family to be your friend, then you\u2019ll be missing out on some great friendships. Of course, this doesn\u2019t mean you should try to date your co-workers; romantic relationships in the office may lead to some fun initially, but will definitely lead to discomfort and awkwardness down the line. Make an extra effort to be friendly. Your co-workers may be wishing for a more friendly relationship but they be afraid to take the first step."

Doing something that you actually want to do on your commute will make you look forward to it instead of dreading it, which will make for a more fun day. If you\u2019re driving, listen to a book on tape, make a phone date with your best friend (as long as you have a headpiece), or even listen to a lecture about the fall of the Roman empire. If you\u2019re on a train, read a magazine, set up fun plans for your weekend, or write in a journal."

While you don\u2019t have to do it every day, spending time with your coworkers at least a few times a week during lunch will help you have more fun than you would when you were alone. As long as you find time to decompress, having lunch with your coworkers will lead to a more positive work day. Try to relax during lunch and to enjoy talking to your co-workers instead of rushing through your food to get back to your work. This social time is important for regaining your energy and it will actually allow you to have more fun when you get back to work, not to mention to have more fun while you eat. Another way to have fun during lunch is to mix it up. If you\u2019re in the habit of grabbing lunch with your coworkers a few times a week, try having Mexican, Indian, Italian, or Thai food throughout the week so you don\u2019t get bored with the same old food."

You can argue that it\u2019ll lead to higher happiness and productivity. Spruce up your workplace. Another way to have more fun at the office is to spruce up your workplace. This can mean bringing in flowers every week, hoping that someone else will follow suit, placing funny magnets on the fridge, bringing snacks for breakfast, or even seeing if you can bring your dog to work once in a while. As long as it\u2019s okay with your boss, making an effort to make your work environment more fun, cheery, and sunny can really make a big difference on the fun factor of going to work. You can even ask if you can spruce up the common area in your workplace. Adding some funny posters, some gorgeous paintings, or some potted plants can make the workplace seem more homey and fun. Bring in activities that can make your office feel more communal. Bake cookies or bring in a partially-completed crossword puzzle and ask for help with it. Participate in fun activities with your coworkers outside of work. If you want to have a more fun work environment, then you should participate in more events with your coworkers so that your work environment feels more fun because you\u2019ll all be getting to know each other better. You can go to a weekly happy hour or trivia night to have some laughs with your co-workers, join a book club with some of them, or be part of a softball league. All of these activities will lead to more fun and friendly work environment. Another fun thing you can do with your coworkers is to join a volunteering organization together. This can help you contribute toward a good cause while bonding. If people in your office seem to like each other but are hesitant to start anything, then you can take the initiative to organize some social events. You\u2019ll be the center of the fun and your co-workers will be grateful. Look up from your computer. This sounds like a small thing, but it can make a huge difference. At some workplaces, people feel locked in to their computers, as if a magnetic force field is keeping them from looking up, even if Jennifer Lawrence or Ryan Gosling walked in to the office. Though it\u2019s important to get your work done, you\u2019ve got to get out of the mentality that you can\u2019t give the people and things around you a moment of your time. Once you loosen up and take the time to smile at people or to look at the croissants someone brought in to the office, you\u2019ll be on your way to having more fun. When someone passes by, make a habit of looking up and saying hello and even having a quick conversation some of the time. This will make your work day more fun and exciting for sure. If you start looking up from your computer more, then other co-workers will follow suit. You can start a trend of more fun and sociability in the workplace. Be kind instead of gossiping. Another way to make your work environment more fun is to develop positive relationships in the workplace. Though everyone loves some good office gossip, starting a trend to actually say positive things about the people you work with and to develop strong connections with them instead of bringing them down can make you much more excited to come to work. You\u2019ll have much more fun at work if you come to think of your coworkers as your friends instead of your frenemies. If one of your co-workers hears that you\u2019ve been praising him or her, then he\u2019ll like you even more for it. Everybody wins. If you\u2019re in a conversation that is filled with gossip, you don\u2019t have to castigate people for it, but you can try to kindly excuse yourself, even if you just say you have to make a phone call real quick. Alternately, you can try to change the subject to something more positive. Getting the Most Out of Your Work Day Make more of an effort to interact with your coworkers. One of the easiest ways to have more fun at work is to make more of an effort to talk to your colleagues. Instead of rushing to your desk and spending all day hanging out with your computer, make an effort to stop and chat with your co-workers every once in a while, even if it\u2019s a quick talk in the kitchen or in the hallway. Taking just a few minutes a day to talk to your co-workers won\u2019t really slow down your productivity and it\u2019ll actually make you have more fun when you come in to the office. The more you talk to people, the more you\u2019ll look forward to seeing friendly faces, and the more fun you\u2019ll have in the workplace. You don\u2019t have to be best friends with your co-workers to laugh and joke around with them a bit. Instead of sending an email or a Skype message to a co-worker who is working just a few feet away from you, make an effort to get up and talk to him or her in person. These small daily interactions will make for a more fun work day. Build meaningful relationships with your coworkers. Having strong relationships with your coworkers can not only help you advance in your career, but it can also help you have more fun at work. If you make a real effort to get to know your coworkers, to socialize with them outside of work, and to consider some of them your friends, you\u2019ll be able to have a lot more fun in the workplace because you\u2019ll be more excited to come in to work if you know your friends are there. Give your co-workers a chance and see which ones can be your real friends; as for the rest of them, work on building a friendly, healthy rapport with them. Don\u2019t make excuses for why you can\u2019t be friends with your co-workers; if you think that one person is too old, too young, or too wrapped up in family to be your friend, then you\u2019ll be missing out on some great friendships. Of course, this doesn\u2019t mean you should try to date your co-workers; romantic relationships in the office may lead to some fun initially, but will definitely lead to discomfort and awkwardness down the line. Make an extra effort to be friendly. Your co-workers may be wishing for a more friendly relationship but they be afraid to take the first step. Get some activity during your lunch break or day. Instead of eating lunch with your coworkers, you can also try taking a yoga or a ballet class during your lunch break a few times a week. If you don\u2019t have time to schedule this much physical activity, then just try to be as active as possible throughout your day. This can help your body feel energized while leaving your mind feeling happier. Here are some other ways to get activity during work:\nTake the stairs instead of the elevator\nWalk to a co-worker\u2019s desk to have a conversation instead of sending an email\nDo five minutes of basic stretching or exercising at your desk\nTake breaks to walk outside, even if it\u2019s just to get lunch or coffee Enjoy your commute. One way to have more fun during your work day is to turn your commute into something you look forward to instead of something that you dread. A lot of people spend their commute listening to music and either dreading the workday or decompressing from it. You can do better than that. Doing something that you actually want to do on your commute will make you look forward to it instead of dreading it, which will make for a more fun day. If you\u2019re driving, listen to a book on tape, make a phone date with your best friend (as long as you have a headpiece), or even listen to a lecture about the fall of the Roman empire. If you\u2019re on a train, read a magazine, set up fun plans for your weekend, or write in a journal. Eat communal lunch. Though a lot of people use lunch as a time to decompress, make phone calls to the repairman, or just to be left alone, making a habit of having communal lunch can make you feel more bonded to your co-workers and to have more fun during this time of the day. While you don\u2019t have to do it every day, spending time with your coworkers at least a few times a week during lunch will help you have more fun than you would when you were alone. As long as you find time to decompress, having lunch with your coworkers will lead to a more positive work day. Try to relax during lunch and to enjoy talking to your co-workers instead of rushing through your food to get back to your work. This social time is important for regaining your energy and it will actually allow you to have more fun when you get back to work, not to mention to have more fun while you eat. Another way to have fun during lunch is to mix it up. If you\u2019re in the habit of grabbing lunch with your coworkers a few times a week, try having Mexican, Indian, Italian, or Thai food throughout the week so you don\u2019t get bored with the same old food. Take breaks. Another important thing to do if you want to have more fun at work is to take breaks from your work at least once an hour. Ideally, you should take a 10-15 minute break after an hour to an hour and a half of solid work so that you can regroup, rest your mind, and give your body a break, too. A break can mean taking a 15-minute walk, reading your favorite gossip site, closely reading a poem from a book you keep in your desk, or even drawing a quick sketch. If you get too locked into your work, you won\u2019t be having any fun. Breaks also give you something to look forward to and keep you motivated. If you tell yourself, \u201cOnce I finish this report, I\u2019ll check if Josh and Andi from the bachelorette are still together,\u201d you\u2019ll be much more motivated than if you think, \u201cOnce I finish this report...I\u2019ll start the next report.\u201d\nEven a short break to rest your eyes to meditate, rake your Zen garden, or just to stare outside the window for a few minutes can have a big impact on your productivity as well as how much fun you\u2019re having.",
