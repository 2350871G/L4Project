The circles don\u2019t have to be evenly spaced. Some can be farther away from others. They are just a template that will help you later."

Trace around it with a pencil. Then remove the jar, place a bowl on the paper, and trace around that. Continue until you have made circles that fill up most of the paper, but stop before they are big enough to touch the edges."

You will erase these lines later, but in the meantime they can help you line up your shapes symmetrically around your center point. If you want your mandala to look more organic and less symmetrical, you can skip drawing these guiding lines."
