Getting your furniture clean before you paint it is important so that you don\u2019t accidentally make specks of dirt stick to the furniture.

Choose a primer designed for the kind of wood your furniture is made out of. Apply a coat of primer with even brushstrokes, in the direction of the wood grain. Let the primer dry completely before applying your coat of paint. Some primers take hours to dry and some only 10 minutes."

Just soak a rag in deglosser and run it over the furniture. The liquid will seep into all the tiny nooks and crannies of your furniture. Make sure to use liquid deglosser outside, because it has a very strong smell. Wear gloves and protective goggles. Once the deglosser dries, you can paint your furniture with whatever kind of paint you like."
