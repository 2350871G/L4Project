White-stemmed chard is usually the most productive, but colored chard are the most attractive ornamental option. Perpetual varieties have a spinach-like taste. White-stemmed varieties, such as \u2018Fordhook Giant\u2019 and \u2018Silverado,\u2019 are usually more tolerant of both heat and cold than other types of chard. Colored varieties, such as \u2018Pink Passion,\u2019 \u2018Golden Sunrise,\u2019 and \u2018Orange Fantasia,\u2019 come in shades of red, pink, yellow, and orange, and usually grow quite tall. You can find some seeds and seedlings that only feature a single shade and others that offer a mixture of colors. Colored varieties of chard are usually the least cold hardy, so they work best in warm to mild climates. Perpetual varieties, such as \u2018Perpetual\u2019 and \u2018Verde da Taglio\u2019, provide mild tasting leaves over a more prolonged growing season. They tolerate heat pretty well, so they're a good option for warmer climates."

The obvious benefit of planting chard from seedlings is that you don\u2019t have to wait as long for the plant to develop, so you can enjoy your chard more quickly. Buying starter plants will also save you time. On the other hand, planting chard from seeds is less expensive and you usually have a wider range of varieties to choose from. In a warm or mild climate, you shouldn\u2019t run into much trouble planting your chard as seeds.

If you\u2019re opting for a spring harvest, plant the chard two to three weeks before the last frost. For a fall harvest, you can plant as early as late summer but no later than 40 days before the first frost. A spring planting usually provides a harvest through the spring, summer, and fall. If you plant in both the spring and the fall, you can have a chard harvest virtually year round."

In early spring and fall, when the weather tends to be cooler, chard prefers full sun. In the summer, when the weather is warmer, it prefers partial sun. However, keep in mind that chard usually tolerates heat fairly well, so it can work well in a sunny section of your garden. Chard grows well in containers, so if you don\u2019t have the right spot for it in your garden, consider planting it in a pot or planter."

You should also mix some compost and organic fertilizer, according to the rates on the label. Allow the mixture to sit for two to three weeks, so the soil has time to receive enough moisture and air. Chard grows best in soil with a pH between 6.0 and 6.8, so it\u2019s slightly acidic. You can purchase a soil pH testing kit at your local garden supply store to check your garden."

If you\u2019re working with chard seedlings, place them in rows approximately 12-inches apart. When you\u2019re creating the rows for the chard, make sure that they\u2019re at least 12 to 18 inches apart.

Place a rain gauge in your garden, so you know how much water the plants have received and adjust accordingly. Giving chard enough water can also help prevent it from getting a bitter taste. Adding an organic mulch around the plants can help them retain moisture so they grow well. Ground bark, compost, straw, or finely ground leaves work well as mulch."
