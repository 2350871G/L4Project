Close your eyes, and count to ten. Visualize a calm and happy place, such as the ocean or a babbling brook. These techniques will help your body relax, and they will release any anxiety you have. You can tense your muscles and slowly release them during your count. Or you can squeeze a stress ball and slowly relax your grip. While visualizing your happy place, try to invoke all of your senses. If you are on the ocean, imagine the wind, the salty taste of the air, and the sand between your toes.

This will help you recall details. It will also help keep your notes legible. Do ten flash cards a day. Memorize these ten before adding another ten the next day. Memorizing in small batches will help you remember. Take notes as you read. After you\u2019re done reading a passage, write down a summary of what you just read. This will help you understand what you read better. When taking notes by hand, use block letters rather than cursive writing. The results are more likely to be legible and it becomes a habit fast. Half of the benefit of note taking is that writing it down tells your brain to put it in long term memory. Test yourself after each passage. Do math exercises that test the principles you just learned. Quiz yourself on historical dates. These recall exercises will prepare you for the real test."

If you packed last semester\u2019s schedule with high-level, difficult courses you may have the answer to why your grades tanked. Even the most highly intelligent individual should give him or herself a break. Try mixing difficult courses with some of your easier or lighter courses for a balanced schedule. Stay on top of your studies. The key to staying zen is to now keep up with your studies at a pace that matches what you need to be learning. Staying organized, committed, and persistent will help you to stay zen in your college studies. However, if the studies are not improving after you've made changes, then it's probable that you need to seriously consider changes to the career path you've mapped out for yourself. Spending energy on something that isn't working out for you will only worsen your situation. Study smarter, not harder. You do not want to spend sixteen hours a day studying if you are not learning anything. You will only burn yourself out. Find study methods that work for you in the future. There are a few tactics you can do to help improve memory and comprehension:\nRewrite your notes every night after class. This will help you recall details. It will also help keep your notes legible. Do ten flash cards a day. Memorize these ten before adding another ten the next day. Memorizing in small batches will help you remember. Take notes as you read. After you\u2019re done reading a passage, write down a summary of what you just read. This will help you understand what you read better. When taking notes by hand, use block letters rather than cursive writing. The results are more likely to be legible and it becomes a habit fast. Half of the benefit of note taking is that writing it down tells your brain to put it in long term memory. Test yourself after each passage. Do math exercises that test the principles you just learned. Quiz yourself on historical dates. These recall exercises will prepare you for the real test.",
