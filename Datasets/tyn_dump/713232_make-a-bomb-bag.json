Leave a little bit of air inside the snack bag of vinegar, as opposed to pressing it before sealing and letting the air escape. You need to initially separate the vinegar and baking soda because they react almost instantly, which means that if you poured them in together, you wouldn't have time to seal the bag before the pressure builds. Adding them in separately ensures that the reaction in the bag will be able to build up to an explosion."
