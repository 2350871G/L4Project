Pretty much all modern showerheads have flow regulators to reduce water usage. If you live in an area that normally has low water pressure, the regulator turns the water flow into little more than a trickle. Another option is to drill into the regulator to widen its opening. The wider opening lets more water through, increasing the pressure."

        "If you live in an area that normally has low water pressure, the regulator turns the water flow into little more than a trickle.",
        "Another option is to drill into the regulator to widen its opening.",
        "The wider opening lets more water through, increasing the pressure.",
        "Upgrade to a new showerhead with better water flow.",
        "You may have bought a low-flow showerhead by mistake.",
        "Replace it with a smaller showerhead featuring fewer or smaller nozzle holes.",
        "Older showerheads often don\u2019t have flow regulators in them, so if you have one, it could also fix the problem.",
        "Many newer showerheads are regulated to restrict water usage.",
        "In the U.S., for instance, manufacturers have to include a flow regulator.",
        "If you don\u2019t want that, you will need to either remove the regulator or track down an old showerhead.",
        "Fixing Problems on the Water Line Look for kinks in the water line leading to the shower.",
        "Many homes have flexible lines running from the valve in the wall to the showerhead.",
        "If your shower has a flexible line instead of stiff pipes, you can see it by removing the showerhead and faucet.",
        "Pull it forward to straighten out any bends in it.",
        "The water heater in your home may also have a braided line, so check there as well.",
        "Problems with the plumbing are easier to deal with when the supply lines are first installed.",
        "If you suspect that something is wrong with the line, you may need to have someone open the wall to take a look at it.",
        "Search your home for any water spots from leaking pipes.",
        "Starting from the shower, walk back to where the water utility line enters your home.",
        "The plumbing is difficult to trace once it passes into the walls, so look for dripping water, puddles, or water stains.",
        "If you have exposed pipes in your home, such as in the basement, inspect them for signs of damage.",
        "Call a plumber or repair leaks to improve the water pressure.",
        "While you\u2019re waiting for a plumber, you can stop the leak by turning off your home\u2019s water supply or by covering it with epoxy putty.",
        "Leaks are dangerous, so get them fixed as soon as possible.",
        "If you\u2019re unsure whether or not you have a leak, locate the water meter.",
        "It will be either where the utility line enters your home or in a separate box.",
        "Turn off your home\u2019s water valve for a few hours to see if the meter continues to rise.",
        "Open the main shut-off valve if it has been closed.",
        "The main valve to your home is typically in your basement or outside the wall where the water line enters your home.",
        "The valve will have a brightly-colored wheel or a lever you need to turn to open it.",
        "Turn the handle clockwise to open the valve if it has a wheel.",
        "If yours has a lever, lower it so it\u2019s perpendicular to the valve.",
        "Contractors sometimes shut off the valve and forget to open it back up all the way.",
        "If you have had construction or repair work done near your home recently, check the valve.",
        "Shut off the pressure-reducing valve if your home has one.",
        "Check for a valve along the main water line in your basement.",
        "It is a triangular cap with a screw-on it.",
        "Turn the screw clockwise a couple of times using a wrench if you can\u2019t do it by hand.",
        "Then, test out the water flow in your shower to see how much the pressure has increased.",
        "Pressure-reducing valves wear out over time.",
        "If yours looks old, shut off the water supply and use a wrench to twist off the connectors on its ends.",
        "Open the water heater shut-off valve if you can\u2019t get hot water.",
        "If you can get a good stream of cold water but not hot water, your water heater is to blame.",
        "Locate it in the bottom level of your home.",
        "It will have a control valve similar to the one on the main water line.",
        "Turn it counterclockwise to open it, then test your shower.",
        "If the valve is open, flushing your water heater could fix it.",
        "Otherwise, call a plumber to take a look at it.",
        "Flush the hot water tank to clear out debris.",
        "If you haven\u2019t cleared out the hot water tank recently, debris could be blocking the pipes.",
        "Deactivate power to the heater, then run a garden hose from the heater\u2019s drain to your yard.",
        "Turn on all the hot water faucets in your home, letting the water run until it comes out of the hose completely clear.",
        "If this doesn\u2019t work, call a plumber to take a look at your water heater.",
        "It may have a more serious problem.",
        "Water heaters need to be flushed at least once every 3 years to keep them in working order.",
        "Improving Continual Low Pressure Test your home\u2019s water pressure using a pressure gauge.",
        "Purchase a gauge, then find the outlet closest to where the main water line enters your home.",
        "It will usually be an outside spigot, although it may also be an inside outlet attached to a device like a washing machine.",
        "Twist the gauge onto the outlet, then turn on the water to get a reading.",
        "If the water pressure isn\u2019t between 45 and 55 psi, then you know the problem isn\u2019t inside your home.",
        "In order to complete the test, shut off anything in your home that uses water.",
        "That includes ice machines, running toilets, and refrigerators.",
        "Deactivate their water supply or turn off the appliances.",
        "Most hardware stores sell pressure gauge testing kits.",
        "You can also get them online.",
        "Call your utility provider if the water pressure is lower than normal.",
        "If a pressure gauge shows that the water entering your home is low pressure, see if someone else can fix it.",
        "Contact your local government\u2019s water department or your service provider.",
        "They may be able to solve the problem by replacing old utility pipes, fixing leaks, or taking other steps to improve their service.",
        "It depends on your area and where your home is located.",
        "For a better idea of what is to blame, ask your neighbors if they are also experiencing low water pressure.",
        "If they are also having problems, then it\u2019s the city\u2019s fault.",
        "Your municipal provider may decide not to address the problem.",
        "In that case, your only option is to install a pressure booster.",
        "Install a pressure booster to deal with low-pressure city water.",
        "A pressure booster is a tank that connects to your water main near where it enters your house.",
        "You will need to use a pipe cutter to remove a section of the waterline.",
        "Then, connect the line to the pressure booster by welding new pipes together.",
        "Finish by contacting an electrician as needed to wire the booster into your home\u2019s circuit breaker.",
        "Pressure boosters can burst weak or clogged pipes.",
        "Watch the meter on the booster and adjust it to keep the pressure between 45 and 55 psi.",
        "Call a plumber if you need help installing a pressure booster.",
        "They can also make sure your home\u2019s water system is capable of handling the increased water pressure.",
        "Take showers during the off hours if all else fails.",
        "Do what you can to fix potential problems in your home, then try using the shower again.",
        "If you\u2019re sure your home receives water at the right pressure, then you may need to adjust your schedule a little bit.",
        "Water pressure decreases as more people tap into the utility line.",
        "Take showers when fewer people are using the water supply to avoid the problem.",
        "You may still experience low water pressure at times even after fixing problems.",
        "It is normal in many areas.",
        "For example, don\u2019t expect to get the good water pressure when you have a washing machine and sink running.",
        "Also, expect lower pressure in the morning and evening, since those are common times for other households to use lots of water."
