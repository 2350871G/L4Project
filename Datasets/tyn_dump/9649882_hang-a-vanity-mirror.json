The mounting hooks will ensure the mirror hangs correctly and is well supported on the wall. Weigh the mirror on a bathroom scale to ensure you get mounting hooks that are strong enough to support the weight. The weight restrictions for the mounting hooks will be noted on the package.

Check that they sit evenly across from one another with a leveller, then attach them with a screwdriver. Make sure the straight part of the \"D\" faces downward.
