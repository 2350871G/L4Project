    "text": " Making Cinnamon Roll Dessert Cups Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (191\u00b0C). Grease the inside of a cupcake pan with butter or nonstick cooking spray. Flatten a cinnamon roll between two sheets of wax paper. Open a can of cinnamon rolls. Take one and place it between two sheets of wax paper. Use a rolling pin to roll it into a 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) wide circle. Tuck the cinnamon roll circle into a cup on your pan. Use you fingers to press it down into the cup and shape the sides. Continue rolling and shaping the other 7 cinnamon rolls into cups. Leave the cinnamon rolls in the pan. Bake the cinnamon roll cups for 8 minutes. You are under-baking them because you have to flatten them partway. Do not turn the oven off after the 8 minutes are up. Flatten the cinnamon rolls. As the cinnamon rolls bake, they will puff up, messing up the cup shape. After the first 8 minutes, take them out of the oven. Use the end of a rolling pin, wooden spoon, or small glass to gently pat down the cinnamon rolls in the center. Bake the cinnamon roll cups for 6 more minutes. Once you have flattened all of the cups, put them back into the oven for 6 more minutes. They are ready when they turn a golden-brown color. Allow the cups to cool completely in the pan. This will take about 10 to 15 minutes. Once they have cooled, pop them out of the tin. You may have to run a thin knife around the inside of each pan cup to loosen them first. Use the cinnamon roll cups. Fill them with pudding, custard, ice cream, sliced fruit, or whatever suits your fancy. Store any leftover cinnamon roll cups in an airtight container. Making Filled Cinnamon Roll Cups Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Grease the inside of a 6-cup muffin pan with butter or nonstick cooking spray. You only need to grease 5 cups. If you don't have a 6-cup muffin pan, you can use the 5 inner cups on a 12-cup muffin pan instead. Beat the cream cheese until it is smooth.

Save the packet of icing that came with the can. You can also make cinnamon rolls from scratch instead. Press the cinnamon roll disk into the bottom of a muffin well. This will make the base of your cup. Unwrap the rest of the cinnamon rolls and set them into the bottom of each well. Save the scraps; you will be using them in a moment. Place a cinnamon roll strip into a muffin well to form a cup. Take one of the excess cinnamon roll strips. Form it into a ring and tuck it into one of the muffin wells. Press it against the sides to resemble a cup. Use your finger to smooth down the side seam on the walls of your cup. There may be some overlap at the seams, which is fine. Repeat this step for the remaining scraps and muffin wells. Spoon the cream cheese mixture into each cup. You will use about1 1/2 tablespoons (cc grams) for each cinnamon roll cup. Bake the cups for 18 to 20 minutes. They are ready when they turn a light, golden brown color. Let the cups cool before removing them. Allow the cups to cool in the muffin pan for about 2 minutes. Run a thin knife around the inside edges of each well to loosen the cups, then pop them out. Drizzle each cup with icing, if desired. Open up the packet of icing that came with your cinnamon rolls.
