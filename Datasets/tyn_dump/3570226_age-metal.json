This process is ideal for props or furniture, where you want to create an artistic antique finish. Sand the metal object with 80-grit sandpaper. Use a sanding pad or sander for larger pieces of metal. Sanding will remove the shine on a finish. Rub the metal object until the surface loses the shine and slickness. Wipe away any dust left behind from the sanding. Wipe down the metal with mineral spirits or vinegar to clean the surface.

Be sure to paint only in a well-ventilated area. Start dabbing or brushing in very small strokes on your metal object.

Let the coat of black acrylic dry overnight. You will need to allow the paint to dry completely before applying the next layer. Find an out of the way area to store your metal overnight. Wash your brush while the paint is still wet to remove it more easily. Choose your accent colors. If you want a galvanized look, buy a matte gunmetal grey and burnt umber paint color. If you want a bronzed look, buy matte acrylic burnt and raw umber paints. Don't feel like you have to layer your paints. You can try sponging some gunmetal grey to create and aged galvanized metal look. Then decide how much, if any, umber to add. If you want a bronzed look, you will mix your raw and burnt umbers to create a warm bronze color. Wet your brush. Pour your selected paint color onto your palette. Your paint color will vary depending upon the finish you want to achieve. Dab the paint unevenly around the metal object. You want to create the look of an uneven patina.
