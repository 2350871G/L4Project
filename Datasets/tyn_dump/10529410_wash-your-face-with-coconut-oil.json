For the best quality oil, choose organic, virgin coconut oil, which doesn\u2019t have any additives and is 100% natural. How often should you cleanse your face with coconut oil? It\u2019s best to use this method no more than once a day, either in the morning or at night. Any more than that and your skin could become too oily."

Pay special attention to any areas that are particularly oily or where dirt builds up, like your chin or in the creases next to your nose. The spots on your face that tend to get oilier are usually located in what\u2019s known as the T-zone, which includes your forehead, nose, chin, and the skin around your mouth. Avoid getting any oil in your eyes. If you do, you\u2019ll notice your vision might be blurry for a few minutes, but it will pass. If you have sensitive skin, do a patch test before you apply the oil to your entire face. Put the oil on a small spot, let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes, then rinse it off.
