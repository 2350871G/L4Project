You must clearly reject the sin you have committed and resolve not to commit it again.

This does not mean that you can never sin again; we humans do it every day. You are simply resolving to try to avoid the near occasions that lead you to sin -- this still counts as repentance.

Consider asking yourself these questions when making your examination of conscience:\nWhen did I last go to confession? Was it an honest and thorough confession?
