Aluminum foil can help prevent food from browning too quickly. The fan inside of the halogen oven is very strong, however, and loose foil will be easily blown off. If the foil becomes loose, it could float around the inside of the machine and could damage the heating element."

Many recipes will not mention a preheating step since the halogen oven takes such a short amount of time to reach a high temperature. Nonetheless, preheating your oven will still produce the best results. Some machines have a preheat button.

Halogen ovens usually have a top rack and a bottom rack. Use the bottom rack for baking, roasting, defrosting, steaming, re-heating, and most other forms of cooking. Use the top rack for grilling, browning, or toasting. Leave at least 1/2 inch (1 cm) gap in between the bakeware and the sides, bottom, and top of the machine.

Most halogen oven timers can be programmed for times up to 60 minutes. Note that the oven will turn off as soon as the timer setting has been reached.
