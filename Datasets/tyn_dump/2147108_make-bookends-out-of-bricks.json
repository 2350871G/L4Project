For example, be sure to use completely dry bricks before beginning the project. This might mean leaving the bricks to dry somewhere first if you've unearthed them from a wet outdoor location. Second, avoid bricks that you can't sit evenly. Bricks that have chunks of mortar stuck to them or that have missing corners that make them wobbly might not be suitable for the bookend, although by all means test their balance first and see if you can't knock off that mortar with a few well placed hammer knocks. And of course, ensure that the bricks are clean before proceeding\u2013\u2013a cloth dipped in hot soapy water and rubbed over dirt and stains should help to remove the worst of any grime build-up. Be sure to use solid bricks not the ones with holes. They may not be heavy enough and will not give you a smooth surface.mor\nIt's recommended that you make the bricks in pairs each time, as clearly having one brick for each end of the bookshelf is helpful in most cases."

The decorating possibilities this article covers are: paper (decoupage), fabric, photos, paint, glitter and three dimensional. Follow the section below that suits your needs best.

Also, cheap flimsy paper is not an option\u2013\u2013even though you'll be decoupaging it, the flimsier the paper, the more likely it is that it'll rip and won't present a good final look.

Wrap as if you were wrapping a present, only be as neat as you can possibly be and avoid too much overlap at either end or you'll create unevenness. Cut out the decoupage images. If you haven't already done so, cut out the images or clip them to size for adding to the brick bookend. Add the images to the base layer. Using decoupage glue, glue the images all over the covered brick in a pattern or randomly, as wished. Follow the glue instructions for drying times. Spray with acrylic sealer to complete the project. Again, wait for it to dry completely. Once dried, start using your new decoupage brick bookends. Painted brick bookends Create a design on paper before painting. It could be as simple as painting the whole brick one simple color (or even simply varnishing it clear).

Display once dried.  Glitter brick bookends Select the glitter and any other related adornments. You could also add rhinestones, costume jewels, sequins and any other affordable bling that jazzes up the look. Cover your workspace well to protect surfaces.  Paint decoupage glue over the brick surface (except for the part that will not be seen). Sprinkle the glitter over the glue. Allow this layer to dry before adding any additional layers of glitter. If adding extra bling, glue on separately once the glittery layers have dried. Use silicon adhesive for such items.
