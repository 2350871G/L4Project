A shovel can break the sprinkler system even further. Use a smaller hand trowel when you dig around the damaged section of the line and make your repairs without damaging more of it. A larger break in the system could mean a costly repair. Cut a square patch with a shovel over the break if the line is buried.

Use a clean cloth and water to scrub the dirt from it. Fixing the Broken Line Saw off a 4 in (10 cm) section of pipe at the leak. You need to remove a large enough section to fit your slip coupling into the pipe. Once you\u2019ve exposed the pipe where the leak or break is, use a hacksaw to remove the section that contains the leak or break. Use smooth, consistent sawing motions to cut the pipe so the edge is even. Remove the damaged piece of pipe after you cut it. Place a band clamp on each end of the pipe. A band clamp is a strap of metal that forms a loop that you can tighten. After you\u2019ve removed the damage section of pipe, slide a band clamp on to each end of the pipe. Don\u2019t tighten the clamps yet so you can fit your slip coupling into the gap. You can find band clamps at your local hardware store, department stores, or online.

Use the mechanism on the band clamps to screw them tight so the slip coupling is held firmly in place. The clamps must be secure in order to prevent any leaks. Use a screwdriver to tighten the band clamps. Turn on the sprinkler system and check for a leak. After you\u2019ve made your repairs, you need to test it before you cover the line back up.
