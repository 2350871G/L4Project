A few of the most common humidifiers include: \n\nCentral humidifiers. Central humidifiers are used to humidify an entire house. They are built into the house\u2019s heating and cooling system. Evaporators. Evaporators are smaller humidifiers that use filters and fans to add moisture to the air. These types of humidifiers tend to be very affordable. Impeller humidifiers. Impeller humidifiers release a cool mist into the air. This is especially good news for people who have children in the house. These humidifiers use fast moving disks to release their mist, and they work best for single rooms. Steam vaporizers. Steam vaporizers heat up the water in the water reservoirs and the force the water to cool before releasing it into the air as a mist. These are the most economically friendly humidifiers, but they can release hotter mists, which can cause burns. Ultrasonic humidifiers. Ultrasonic humidifiers use vibrations to release moisture into the air. Since these come in both cool and warm mist variations, they are a good choice for a home with children. Pick one that is sized properly for your intended use and room volume and be aware that they will vary in cost depending on size and features."
