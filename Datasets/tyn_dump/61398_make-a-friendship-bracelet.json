Tie the bracelet around a toe for stability. You can also tape it to a surface, or close it in a drawer. However, pinning is better than taping because the pin keeps your bracelet from wriggling out of the proper position. Spread out the threads. Before you start getting crafty with knotting, spread out the threads so that the colors are in the order you'd like the striped patterns to be. To make the knotted end of your bracelet less bulky, try not to cross the threads over one another too much. Pass the first strand over the second strand to tie a knot.

Now that you've knotted both ends of the bracelet, just tie the strands of the bracelet together and you\u2019re ready to rock it! If you want your bracelet super snug, have a friend knot the bracelet after you put it on. Adding a Simple Braid and Beads Add a simple braid. If you want a little extra flair, try a simple braid. The braid will be on either end of the bracelet, so you should start your braid before knotting the main design. Gather neighboring individual strings into groups of two or three so that you have three main threads to braid with (left, center, right). Cross the right strand over the center strand.

Braid the other end of the bracelet. After you have a good length of the striped pattern, finish off your bracelet with a short length of simple braid. Add charms or beads to the end of the bracelet. If you feel like your bracelet needs a little something extra, thread some fun charms or beads onto the strands as you braid. Tie them in a knot to secure them. All done!
