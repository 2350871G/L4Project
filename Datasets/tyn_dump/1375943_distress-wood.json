Stick with a high-grit sandpaper and vary the amount of pressure you apply to each area for more natural-looking wear, or use sanders with different grits to change the character of each surface slightly. You might also choose to go over the flat face surfaces as well, especially in smooth, glossy areas that give away the newness of the wood. Some strategic sanding alone can instantly make untouched wood look well-aged."

Place a second board over the top, then stand on the upper board and walk back and forth slowly. Your weight will grind the gravel into the surface of both boards, leaving behind distinct marks in a random pattern.

If you want the wood to look severely distressed, work the chisel deeper into the surface to take off entire chunks.
