Natural gas is flammable and, while you should not come in direct contact with the gas, safe is better than sorry. Avoid using candles, cigarettes, or other open flames in the home while you're adjusting the water heater. You do not need to turn off the gas while adjusting the water temperature. Locate the dial on the front of the water heater. This is the gas control valve. It is usually a black or red knob with 2 sides: warm and hot. In some cases, it might also have notches on the side to clearly mark these temperature options. Twist the dial from the warm to the hot side. Do not turn the dial completely to hot. First, move it slightly towards hot from where it was before. If the temperature is moved completely to hot, the water may scald your hand. You can always move it further towards hot later on, if needed. Wait 3 hours, then check the water temperature.
