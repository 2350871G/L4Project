    "text": " Making Lemon Frosting Cream the butter until it turns light and fluffy. Put the butter into a mixing bowl, and beat it with a handheld mixer. If you have a food processor with a whisk attachment, use that instead. Mix in the lemon juice, vanilla extract, and lemon zest. If you'd like a smoother frosting, omit the lemon zest. If you'd like a less sweet frosting, omit the vanilla extract. Beat in the sugar gradually, 1 cup (125 grams) at a time. Use medium speed, and keep beating until the mixture becomes smooth. From time to time, scrape the sides of the bowl so that everything mixes evenly. Add more sugar or lemon juice, if necessary. If the frosting is too dry, add a little more lemon juice or milk.
