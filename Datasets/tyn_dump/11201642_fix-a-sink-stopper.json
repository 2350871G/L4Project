        "Once the washer is in position, slide the nut onto the end of the pivot rod and all the way down to the ball.",
        "The nut covers the ball, capping the pipe\u2019s opening.",

        "The rubber washer seals the gap between the ball and the nut.",
        "If you notice leaks from that area, the washer is probably to blame.",
        "Make sure it\u2019s pushed firmly into the retaining nut or, if it\u2019s broken, replace it.",
        "Once you have the front end of the pivot rod secure, you can connect the opposite end to the vertical clevis if you needed to detach it.",
        "Reattach the pivot rod to the clevis using the spring clip.",
        "Slide one end of the spring clip onto the free end of the pivot rod.",
        "Then, push the pivot rod into the nearest slot on the clevis.",

        "Once everything is secure, test the stopper to see if it\u2019s working correctly.",
        "Keep the pivot rod roughly parallel to the ground.",
        "If the stopper sits lower in the sink than you want, move the rod up to the next slot in the clevis.",
        "If you\u2019re replacing or readjusting an old pivot rod, note which hole on the clevis the rod passed through.",
        "Consider marking it with a permanent marker and putting the new rod in the same slot at first.",

        "Slide the hexagonal nuts over the connection points.",
        "Finish by turning the nuts clockwise by hand or with a wrench to lock the pipes in place.",
        "Remember that the U-shaped bend in the pipe sits close to the tailpipe and faces the floor.",
        "Since its ends are not the same length, you can easily figure out how to install the pipe by examining it.",
        "If the hexagonal nuts and P-trap are damaged, get replacements online or at a hardware store.",
        "Slip the nuts onto the pipes before installing the P-trap.",
        "Adjusting a Stopper That Won\u2019t Stay down Detach the pivot rod from the clevis by removing the spring clip.",
        "The clevis is the vertical metal bar that the horizontal pivot rod attaches to beneath the sink.",

        "To detach the pivot rod, squeeze the ends of the spring clip together.",
        "Slide it off and pull the end of the pivot rod free.",
        "Remember to check the pivot rod for damage if you haven\u2019t already.",
        "It could also be responsible for a stuck stopper.",
        "Put the spring clip on the end of the pivot rod.",
        "Slide the pivot rod through one of the holes in the metal clip.",
        "The bend in the clip is meant to fit around the clevis.",

        "Slide one on the pivot rod, slide the pivot rod through the clevis, then add the second clip.",
        "Align the pivot rod with one of the holes in the clevis.",
        "The clevis will have 4 or 5 slots on it.",
        "The closest hole is fine when you\u2019re installing a new pivot rod but reposition the pivot rod as needed.",
        "Try to keep the pivot rod parallel to the ground so the stopper sits at a reasonable height.",

        "Get out from under the sink and pull the lever that controls the stopper.",
        "It should cause the stopper to lower into the drain pipe.",
        "If it doesn\u2019t form a tight seal on the drain, you will need to readjust the pivot rod\u2019s positioning again.",
        "Having someone else on hand helps a lot.",
        "Let them press the lever while you watch the stopper components move.",
        "You will get a better view of the parts and can identify what isn\u2019t working without having to reach for the stopper lever!",
        "Loosen the screw on the clevis to fine-tune the stopper\u2019s positioning.",
        "The clevis has a screw at the top binding it to the stopper\u2019s control lever.",
        "Remove the spring clip and pivot rod first before making an adjustment.",
        "Then, loosen the screw to free the clevis and reposition it.",
        "You can slide it up a little bit to raise the stopper or move it down to lower the stopper.",
        "Return the screw, spring clip, and pivot rod when you\u2019re done.",
        "Repositioning the pivot rod is usually better, but sometimes it doesn\u2019t align with the clevis properly.",
