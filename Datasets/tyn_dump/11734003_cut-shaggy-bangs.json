Instead of brushing some hair to the side, use a wide-toothed comb to arrange your future bangs in front of your forehead and eyes. This process helps you visualize how much hair you have to work with, and makes it easier to section off your bangs. Separate off a triangular portion of hair in front of your forehead. Use your comb to section off a 3 to 4 in (7.6 to 10.2 cm) section of hair in front of your forehead and eyes. Make sure that the section of hair falls about 3 in (7.6 cm) into your hairline so your bangs are thick enough to frame your face. If you have thinner hair, you might want to section off a portion of hair that falls around 4 in (10 cm) into your hairline. When sectioned off, this portion of hair should form an angled, triangular shape along your hairline. Split this portion of hair into 2 even sections, A and B. Use a comb to divide your bangs down the center of your forehead. Before you start trimming or adjusting your bangs, check both sides to ensure that your shaggy bangs will have equal amounts of hair. To prevent confusion later on, label the leftmost portion of hair as section A, and the rightmost portion as section B. Since these bangs will be framing your face, you want them to look as even as possible. Brush section A to the right side of your head. Pinch the hair between your pointer and middle finger, then drag your comb through section A. Pull this portion of hair next to section B. At this point, use your pinched fingers to figure out how much hair you want to trim away. Try to keep around 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of hair dangling beneath your fingers. Pinch more hair than you plan on trimming overall. Pulling your bangs to the right makes it easier for you to see and trim them. Cut the bangs at a downward angle in small increments. Use a pair of scissors or texturizing shears to make small adjustments to the hair dangling beneath your pinched fingers.

Drag your trimming shears in slow, angled motions to even out the edge of your bangs. At this point, the shortest portion of your bangs will be around eye level, while the longest portion will be close to your chin. Adjusting the Second Section Transfer 1 of the shortest tendrils of hair from section A to B. Pinch a small, 5 to 10 mm section of the shortest hair from the right side of section A. Move this small portion of hair over to section B, so you have a reference of how short your bangs need to be. This process helps both of your bangs to look more exact. Comb section B to the left side of your head. Pinch section B between your pointer and middle finger, then pull it toward section A. Drag your comb through this portion of hair to ensure that both sections of hair are relatively even in length. Pinch your hair and cut it at a downwards angle.

Vertical cuts help you make more precise adjustments to your bangs. Compare sections A and B to see if they\u2019re even in length. Stand in front of a mirror and hold both portions of your shaggy bangs next to one another. Check the short ends are equal in length, and that the long ends are even as well. Brush and trim your bangs to make any necessary adjustments. Use your wide-toothed comb to smooth out your newly trimmed bangs.
