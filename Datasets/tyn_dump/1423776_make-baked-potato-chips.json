Use a mandoline set to \u215b inch (3 mm), or a slicing disc attachment on a food processor. If you don't have either of these, sharpen a knife as much as possible and cut by hand. Keep the mandoline surface wet to keep the starch from sticking to the surface. Use a corrugated knife or mandoline blade if you prefer wavy chips. This size makes a thick-cut, crunchy chip, similar to store-bought kettle-cooked chips. You can cut the slices thinner with mandoline, but thin slices burn more easily."

The vinegar stops the potatoes falling apart. Bring to a boil. Add potato slices and cook for exactly three minutes. Cook for one or two minutes instead if slices are thinner than \u215b inch (3 mm).
