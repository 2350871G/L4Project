        "Paint your gun.",
        "You may want to make a realistic gun by painting the entire thing black.",
        "Or maybe your toy gun is really a space-age shooter, in which case gray and red accents might be a better choice.",
        "Acrylic paint works well, but many other kinds of paint should work as well.",
        "You might also wrap black electrical tape around parts of the gun, like the handle.",

        "Your first challenge is to find a broken glue gun.",
        "You might ask your parents or an art teacher if there is a broken model that you can use as the frame for a toy you are making, but be sure you ask to use it first.",
        "To make this toy gun, you'll need:\nGlue gun\nScrewdriver\nParty snaps (optional)\nPaint (optional)\nBlack electrical tape (optional)\nGlue (optional) Remove the screws from your old glue gun.",
        "But before you do, you should check to make sure it isn\u2019t plugged in and is cool to the touch.",
        "Once you know it is safe to take apart, use your screwdriver to take out the screws from the casing.",
        "If you have a battery powered hot glue gun, you should remove the batteries before attempting to unscrew it.",
        "Remove the insides of the glue gun.",
        "Now that the screws are out, you shouldn't have much difficulty pulling the two plastic halves of the case apart, though you might meet with some resistance.",
        "If you have difficulty taking the casing apart, twist the casing slightly to pop it free.",
        "Then:\nIdentify the trigger and loading mechanisms, which should be connected.",
        "The trigger, when pulled, will cause the loading mechanism to push glue sticks through the casing.",
        "Remove all the internal components except the trigger and loading mechanisms.",
        "Take off the metal nozzle at the front of the gun.",
        "Put the casing back together and test the trigger.",
        "Use your screwdriver to reinsert the screws into your casing and fasten it together again.",
        "Then, test the trigger by pressing down on it with your finger.",
        "You should be able to feel some resistance, which means that the trigger is still moving the loading device in the casing.",
        "If the trigger is loose and feels like it isn't engaging the loading mechanism, you'll need to make adjustments.",
        "Open the casing and check the connection between the trigger and loading mechanism.",
        "Repair any breaks between the two with tape.",
        "If it appears that the trigger and loading mechanism have been separated, you may have to reconnect the two with tape.",
        "Add personal touches to your toy gun.",
        "You can give your toy gun a sight by gluing a bead on top of the front end of the barrel.",
