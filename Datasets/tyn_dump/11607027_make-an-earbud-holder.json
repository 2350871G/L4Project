    "text": " Cutting a Credit Card Earbud Holder Punch a hole \u20442 in (1.3 cm) in from the short side of a credit card. Use a credit card or gift card that\u2019s expired or invalid for your project. Place a hole punch in the middle of the credit card\u2019s short side so it\u2019s about \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) in from the edge. Squeeze the handles of the hole punch together to make the hole. The single hole will hold the jack side of the earbud cord. You can buy a hole punch from a craft or office supply store.Warning: Never use a valid credit card to make your earbud holder since someone could easily steal the information if you lose it. Make 2 more holes on the opposite short side of the credit card. Turn the card so you\u2019re working on the other short side directly across from the hole you just punched. Punch the holes so they\u2019re \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) in from the short side and \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) from the long sides. That way, you have space to put each of the earbuds in the holes. Cut straight lines from the short edges of the card to the centers of each hole. Line up the scissor\u2019s blades so they\u2019re perpendicular to the short side of the credit card and so it crosses through the middle of one of the nearest hole. Make a straight cut from the short edge to the hole so there\u2019s a small slit in the card. Repeat the process with the rest of the holes so they each have a slit. The slits allow you to easily bend the credit card so you can slide the wires into the holes. If you aren\u2019t able to cut through the card easily with scissors, make the slits with a utility knife instead. Use your scissors to cut curved notches into the long sides of the credit card. Start your cut with a pair of scissors 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the corner along the long side of the card. Carefully cut a concave curve that goes \u20442\u2013\u20444 inch (1.3\u20131.9 cm) in from the long edge. End your cut so it stops  1 inch (2.5 cm) from the opposite corner of the credit card.

If there are sharp corners after you make your cuts, smooth them out with 120-grit sandpaper so you don\u2019t get hurt or damage your earbuds. Feed the earbuds through the 2 holes on one of the short edges. Slightly push the section of the credit card between the punched holes forward so the slits open up. Feed the wire at the base of an earbud into the slit on one of the holes. Put the other earbud into the second hole on the same side of the card as the first one. Wind the cord around the notches before putting the jack in the empty hole. Straighten out the cord for the earbuds so there aren\u2019t any snags or tangles. Loosely coil the cord around the narrowest section of the cards long sides so they don\u2019t slide around on the credit card. Once you\u2019ve wrapped the entire cord, push the headphone jack through the slit of the last hole. Don\u2019t pull the cord too tightly, or else you could damage the internal wires. Creating a Simple Clothespin Wrap Paint or draw on 2 clothespins if you want your holder to have a design. If you want to add simple designs, lightly sketch on the clothespins with a pencil to see what it looks like. Fill in your design with colored markers or pencils to complete it. If you want to change the colors of the clothespins, pick an acrylic paint and brush a light coat onto them. Let the paint dry completely before moving on. Wooden clothespins work best for making earbud holders. You don\u2019t have to paint or draw designs on the clothespins if you don\u2019t want to. Stack and hot-glue the clothespins so the openings face opposite directions. Set one of the clothespins on top of the other so one points to the left and one points to the right. Apply a line of hot glue along the length of the top piece on one of the clothespins. Press the bottom of the second clothespin against the line of glue and hold it in place for 30 seconds so the glue can set. Hot glue dries within about 1 minute, so be sure to work quickly so the glue doesn\u2019t dry.Variation: If you don\u2019t have hot glue, you can use standard white school glue, but it will take about 5\u201310 minutes for it to dry completely. Clamp the earbuds in the top clothespin. Straighten out the cord for your earbuds to make sure it isn\u2019t twisted or tangled together. Squeeze the left side of the clothespin holder together to open the right side. Put the bottoms of the earbuds in the open right side and let go of the clothespins to snap them shut. The earbuds will stay tightly inside the pin so they don\u2019t pull out. Lightly tug on the cord to make sure the earbuds don\u2019t slip out from the clothespins. If they do, make sure the clothespin only clamps around the wires at the base of each earbud. Wrap the cord around the clothespins lengthwise to secure it. Start with the wires attached to the earbuds and pull them toward the left side of the holder. Position the wires so they go in the opening you squeeze together to open the clothespins. Continue coiling the earbud cord around the large openings on the ends of the holder so it doesn\u2019t fall off. When you reach the headphone jack, clamp it in the bottom clothespin. Don\u2019t pull the cord too tightly or else you could break the internal wires and need to buy new earbuds. Making a Fabric Cord Wrap Make a 4 in \u00d7 4 in (10 cm \u00d7 10 cm) H-shaped template with paper. Cut a piece of paper with a pair of scissors to make a 4 in \u00d7 4 in (10 cm \u00d7 10 cm) square. Fold the piece of paper in half and crease it along the edge. Cut off a \u20442 in \u00d7 \u20444 in (1.3 cm \u00d7 1.9 cm) rectangle from the corners on the folded edge. Unfold the piece of paper so it looks like the letter H.\nThe notches at the top and bottom of the paper will help your earbuds stay in place without them slipping around. Trace and cut the shape from a piece of stiffened felt. Stiffened felt is slightly thicker than standard felt, so it holds its shape better. Place the paper template on top of the felt and outline around it with a pencil or marker. Use your scissors to cut the shape out from the felt to use for your DIY earphone cord holder. You can buy stiffened felt from a fabric or craft store. If you have trouble making clean cuts with a regular pair of scissors, use a pair that\u2019s specifically made for fabric.Tip: If you don\u2019t want the outline you traced visible on the holder, use a disappearing ink marker instead. The ink will fade within 1\u20132 days of you drawing the outline. You can buy disappearing ink markers from your local craft or fabric store. Place a self-adhesive Velcro dot in the center of each long edge. Lay the piece of felt flat on your work surface so the long edges are on the left and right sides. Remove the backing paper from one of the Velcro dots and press it in the middle of the long edge on the left side of the felt. Place the second Velcro dot on the right side so it lines up with the first one when you fold the felt in half. You can buy Velcro dots online or from craft stores. If you can\u2019t find self-adhesive Velcro dots, attach them to the felt with dots of hot glue instead. Wrap the earbud cord around the notches in the felt. Straighten out the cord and place it on the piece of felt so the earbuds are just above the top notch. Guide the other end of the cord underneath the piece of felt and loop it around the notches on the top and bottom. Continue wrapping the cord until you reach the headphone jack. Don\u2019t pull the cord too tight, or else you could break the wires inside and damage the earbuds. Fold the felt in half vertically to secure the Velcro dots together. Grab the left side of the felt and make a vertical fold so it lines up with the right edge. Push the Velcro dots together so they stay attached and hold the cord inside the holder. Put the holder in your pocket or a bag to transport them without getting tangled. Tie a ribbon or piece of twine around the outside of the felt if you\u2019re worried about the Velcro coming undone. Repurposing a Mint Container Peel the labels off of a circular plastic mint container. Look for a circular mint container that\u2019s made of plastic and has a hinged opening in the middle. Pick the label off with your fingernail and remove as much as you can by hand. Completely remove the top and bottom labels so there isn\u2019t any sticky residue left on the container. If the label or adhesive doesn\u2019t easily come off, spray an adhesive remover on the label and try wiping it off with a paper towel. Drill 2 holes on the side of the container underneath the lid opening. Attach a bit that\u2019s \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) thick to your drill to make your holes. Position the first hole on the side of the mint container so it\u2019s \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) below where the lid opens. Keep your nondominant hand on top of the mint tin and slowly push the bit through the plastic. Place the second hole so it\u2019s \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) to the left or right from the first one. You don\u2019t need to drill holes in the side of the mint container if you don\u2019t want to add a key ring.
