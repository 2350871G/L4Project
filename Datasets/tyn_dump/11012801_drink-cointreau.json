Shake it until it is chilled, and strain the mixture into a glass using a cocktail strainer. Add a lime slice as a garnish. You can measure ingredients using a measuring cup, but most bartenders and cocktail aficionados will use a jigger\u2014a double sided metal cylinder used to measure out ingredients. Jiggers are preferred because each side measures ounces in different increments, but they are by no means essential."

Start off by combining 1 ounce of Cointreau in a shaker with 2 ounces of blanco tequila and 1 ounce of fresh lime juice. Shake the ingredients in a shaker with ice until you\u2019ve reached the desired temperature and strain the mixture in to a rocks glass. Garnish the drink with a lime wheel. Most restaurants and bars serve margaritas in a specialty margarita glass. However, it is not uncommon to see margaritas served in an Old Fashioned or pint glass. Margaritas are often served in salt-rimmed glasses. To rim your glass with salt, dip the mouth of your glass in a bowl of shallow water, lime juice, or lemon juice, and then tip your glass into a small dish with salt in it."

If you enjoy Cointreau and experimenting with your beverages, feel free to play around with it as an additional ingredient in your favorite cocktail. Because Cointreau is a brand of triple sec, any drink that lists triple sec as an ingredient can be modified to include Cointreau. Just remember, Cointreau is stronger than most triple secs. Any drink that uses lemon or lime juice as a key ingredient (like a whiskey sour or Penicillin) can play with the flavors brought out in Cointreau, since it is drier than most triple secs and brings out the complex citrus notes. Because of its distinct flavor, Cointreau can cut through the nuances of some spirits. Avoid mixing it with spirits intended to be appreciated on their own (like fine cognacs and scotches)."
