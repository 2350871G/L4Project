You will need a sharp pair of hair cutting scissors (not just any old scissors you have lying around at home) and a fine-toothed comb.

If you don't want to buy a hair cutting scissors, a fabric scissors will do - just make sure it's really sharp. Using dull scissors is a bad idea as you will find it harder to cut your hair and may end up giving yourself split ends - which defeats the purpose of giving yourself a haircut in the first place!"

Drag your fingers down your hair, until you reach a point slightly above where you want to cut your hair.

If you want a blunt end to your hair, just cut straight across and leave it at that. But if you want a softer finish, hold the scissors vertically (perpendicular to your fingers) and cut directly into the hair, until no sharp angles remain. This will give the ends of your hair a more feathery look."

        "Trim your layers (optional).",
        "Working with layers, especially if you have very thick or curly hair, is best left to the professionals.",
        "However, If you absolutely need a quick trim on the layers framing your face, use the following technique:\nGrab as much of the ends of each layer of hair between your fingers as possible, then trim as little hair as possible, holding the scissors at a slightly downward angle.",
        "In other words, trim your hair following the angle from your jaw on that side of your face to the shoulder on the same side.",
        "Use the softening technique described above to even out the ends of the hair, then match the layers on each side of your face to make sure they're the same length.",
        "Double-check your hair when it's dry.",
        "After your hair has dried (in the way that you usually do it, whether that's air-drying or blow drying), check your cut for any glaring inconsistencies.",
        "Use a handheld mirror to check the hair at the back of your head or, better yet, ask a trusted friend to check it for you.",
        "If you find any unevenness, take your scissors one more time and, very carefully, attempt to even it out, cutting as little hair as possible.",
        "Cutting Short Hair Gather materials.",
        "Most extra-short haircuts are achieved with an electric razor and a pair of scissors.",
        "Make sure you have the guard you want for the razor (which will determine how much of your hair it cuts off) and sharp scissors.",
        "Start with wet hair.",
        "You can wash it, or simply dampen it with a spray bottle before you start.",
        "Wet hair is easier to cut, and makes cleanup a breeze.",
        "Start with the top of your head.",
        "For a traditional men's cut, the hair on the top of your head should be slightly longer than it is on the sides and back.",
        "Start an inch or two (2.5-5 cm) above your ear, and follow that line around the back of your head the other ear, moving the razor in a straight-up motion as you cut.",
        "Then, starting at your forehead, trim the top of your hair by moving the razor back over the natural curve of your head.",
        "Catch any spots you missed between these two areas.",
        "Cut the back and sides.",
        "Put the shorter guard on your razor.",
        "Start with your sideburns, moving the razor in an upwards motion.",
        "Cut just as far as the point where you started using the longer guard.",
        "On the back of your head, start the razor at your neck and move upward, again stopping where you cut with the longer guard.",
        "Don't worry about the difference in length for now - that's where the scissors come in.",
        "Use scissors to blend the two hair lengths.",
        "Using the index and middle fingers of your non-dominant hand, grab a section of longer hair that's just above where you switched guards.",
        "With the scissors, carefully trim the hair until the two different lengths blend into each other.",
        "Do this all the way around your head until the two sections look well-blended and the there is no obvious difference between the two lengths.",
        "Have a friend double-check the back of your head, or use a hand mirror in front of a larger mirror to check it yourself.",
        "If the \"long\" part of your hair on top is shorter than finger-width, then skip using your index and middle fingers to pull out sections.",
        "Trimming Bangs (Fringe) Get a sharp pair of scissors.",
        "You can buy scissors meant for hair cutting at a beauty supply store.",
        "Don't just use paper or nail scissors - they're too dull for your hair and will make awkward cuts.",
        "Decide how short you're going to trim.",
        "Make a conservative estimate of where you want your bangs to fall.",
        "Remember, you can always trim more, but growing back the hair that you didn't mean to cut takes a lot longer.",
        "Pull back the rest of your hair.",
        "Secure non-fringe hair so that it's away from your face and out of the danger zone.",
        "If necessary, use a comb to part your bangs away from the rest of your hair.",
        "Wet your bangs.",
        "Splash a bit of water on the hair, or use a spray bottle.",
        "They'll cut more easily wet, and you can do a touch-up once they dry.",
        "Measure where you want to cut.",
        "Grab a section of hair between the index and middle fingers of your non-dominant hand.",
        "Drag your fingers down so that they're resting just above where you want to make a cut.",
        "Trim the hair beneath your fingers.",
        "Put your scissors close to your fingers (so that they're almost parallel) and cut slowly.",
        "Your fingers (and the hair they're holding) should remain stable as the trimmed hair falls away.",
        "Make sure your sides match up.",
        "If you want your bangs to be the same length all the way across, make sure they match up.",
        "On each side, grab a strand between the thumb and forefinger of each hand.",
        "Pull your fingers down slowly and at the same pace.",
        "If one hand runs out of hair before the other, you need to trim a bit to match up the sides.",
        "Do this until you're satisfied that the lengths are even.",
        "Cut side swept bangs (optional).",
        "If you want your bangs to sweep to the side, comb them in the direction that you want them to go.",
        "Tip your head forward slightly, so that your bangs fall away from your face.",
        "Put your scissors in the direction you want your bangs to run.",
        "Starting near the part, position the scissors where you want the shortest part of your bangs.",
        "For side swept bangs, they'll get a bit longer as you go on.",
        "Because of this, angle your scissors slightly downward.",
        "Make short, small cuts across your bangs.",
        "The lengths should be a bit choppy, but not overly so.",
        "Aim to cut sections that are about 0.5 inch (12 mm) wide.",
        "When your bangs dry, touch them up.",
        "Ruffle the hair a bit, and see if you're happy with where it falls.",
        "Make more trims if necessary."
