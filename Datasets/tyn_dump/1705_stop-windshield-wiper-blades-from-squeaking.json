Wipe the blades with the towel until the paper towel comes away clean. Remember to clean the arm and hinged parts as well. Hinged parts of the wiper assembly can stiffen with dirt and grime, contributing to squeakiness. For severely dirty wipers, you may need to use several pieces of paper towel. If your paper towel is somewhat flimsy, double it up before wiping or use a rag. If your wiper blades don't stay in position when pulled away from the windshield, hold the blade away from the glass with your free hand and clean them one at a time."

Simply sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda on a water dampened paper towel for a stronger cleaning. Then wipe the glass clean in a top-to-bottom motion. Remedy squeaking on-the-go with alcohol wipes. If squeaking starts suddenly when you\u2019re on the road, you won\u2019t have the luxury of having household supplies on hand. Instead, keep some alcohol wipes in your car. When squeaking occurs, wipe the rubber of both blades with the alcohol wipe. Resolving Common Causes of Squeaking Refill your windshield wiper fluid. Lots of wipers skip and squeak because the windshield isn't quite wet enough. Check your fluid level and top it off when necessary. This way, your sprayers are ready for action if squeaking occurs. Adjust the position of the wiper blades when necessary. Windshield wipers are designed to follow behind the motion of the wiper arm. If your blades are stiff and don\u2019t trail behind the arm in a back-and-forth motion, twist the arm with your hands to loosen the stiffness. Blades that are too tight won\u2019t be able to alternate back and forth to trail behind the wiper arm smoothly, which causes chattering and squeaking.

Replacing Wiper Parts Install new rubber inserts. If the non-rubber blade and arm parts are still in good condition, it goes without saying you won\u2019t need to replace them. But sometimes the rubber breaks down faster than non-rubber parts (especially in sunny areas). Remove and replace the rubber blade inserts. Replace your wiper blades regularly.
