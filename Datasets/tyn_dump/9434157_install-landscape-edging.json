Continue adding pieces in, connecting them, and backfilling as you go until the whole trench is filled. Edging with Brick Lay out a bed and dig a trench around the edges. Lay out the borders of the garden or planter that you want to create. Dig out the inside and fill it with soil, or whatever medium you wish to use. Use a spade to dig a trench for the edging to go into. Then, pack down the trench bottom with scrap lumber so that it\u2019s flat. Insert 2 stakes and string a level mason\u2019s line. Hammer stakes that are about 4\u20136 inches (10\u201315 cm) long into the ground at either end of the trench. Tie or hook mason\u2019s line to the top of one stake and walk it to the other stake. Hold the twine taut and tie or hook it to the other stake. Put a brick in the trench and hang a line level from the twine to make sure it\u2019s level. Set each brick with a mallet and backfill as you go. Use the mason\u2019s line as reference while you place the bricks in one at a time. For each one, pound the top with a mallet and fill in the space left in the trench around the brick with soil, rocks, or mulch. Continue this until the entire trench is filled in with bricks. Water around all the your edging to help bring the components together. Cut a brick with a brick chisel if necessary.
