By removing the old caulk that may be cracking, you're avoiding building a new layer on weak foundations. Additionally, you'll be able to be more precise with how much caulk you want to use. Place the sharp end of the putty knife at the base of the old caulk. Then, grab the handle and push the knife forward. Keep pushing forward until all of the caulk has been removed. If you don't have a putty knife, you can use a wire brush instead. The abrasive wire bristles will scrape the old caulk off when you brush firmly. Patiently, brush the targeted caulk for several minutes. For silicone caulking, pry up one side and then pull the strip out with needle-nose pliers."
