It also needs to be 3 in (7.6 cm) taller than the height of your book in order to fit properly. Cut open your brown paper shopping bag along one seam. Choose either side, rather than the bottom. Be sure you don\u2019t cut both sides, only one. Remove the handles if it has any. Cut off the flaps formed by the bottom of the bag. Don\u2019t cut more than 1 to 2 in (2 to 5 cm). You want one large sheet of paper. Place the book in the center of the paper. Make sure the paper is large enough to cover the book in its entirety. Check that the paper will wrap around the book, covering the front and back. Covering the Book Wrap the paper up across the bottom of the book. Make a crease along the bottom cover. You can use double-sided tape to secure the fold, if you wish. This will help secure the cover. Place the book on top of the bottom fold so the edges are even. Wrap the paper up across the top of the book. Make a crease along the top cover. Again, feel free to use tape to hold the fold in place. Then, remove the book from the paper. Measure the folds. They should be at least 1.6 in (4 cm) in length. Fold the paper up at the bottom crease and down at the top crease. You should have a strip of paper big enough to cover the book from top to bottom. Try not to create new folds on top of preexisting folds in the paper. This will cause your book cover to tear more easily. Place the book back in the center of the paper. Wrap the paper across the front of the book from left to right and adjust the book position until the two ends of the paper are even. Fold the overlap around the front cover of the book. Make a crease. Then insert the front cover of the book into the slot created by the paper folded over at the top and the bottom. Slide the paper over the book until you hit the crease. Fold the overlap around the back cover of the book. Make a crease. Then insert the back cover of the book into the slot created by the paper folded over at the top and the bottom. Slide the paper over the book until you hit the crease. Stop if the cover fits snugly.
