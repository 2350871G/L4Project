If you don\u2019t have an 8-inch pan, you can also use a 9x1-1/2-inch round baking pan, or 10-inch cast-iron skillet. Make sure to grease the bottom and sides of whatever pan you choose to use. Instead of greasing the pan, you can also add a tablespoon of butter to whatever pan you are using and stick the pan in the preheated oven for about three minutes. When the butter is melted, take it out of the oven and swirl it around. Using a hot pan helps to make the edges of the cornbread crispy and the butter serves to increase the flavor of the cornbread."
