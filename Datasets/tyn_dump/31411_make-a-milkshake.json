Choose two brands of ice cream that are the same size (a pint, a quart, etc.) and hold one in each hand. The one that feels heavier will make the better milkshake. Ice creams that are lighter and fluffier contain more air. When you mix the milkshake you'll be introducing even more air, and won't get the thick, creamy consistency you want in a milkshake. Go for the dense ice cream over the extra-churned ice cream so you'll start out with less air. You can of course use any ice cream flavor you want, so stray from the vanilla base if you want to experiment. If you want a mint chocolate chip milkshake but don't want to mess with mint extract and chocolate chips, go ahead and use a mint chip ice cream."
