You can also create a mint tea with fresh leaves plucked directly from the stem. Just keep in mind that you will need a larger quantity of mint when using fresh leaves rather than dried ones. You will need roughly 3 to 4 cups (600 to 700 grams) of fresh mint leaves to make 1 US quart (0.95 L) of tea."
