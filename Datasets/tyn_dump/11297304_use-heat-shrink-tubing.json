Once you can feed the wire into a hole and it doesn\u2019t shift around while it\u2019s inserted, then write down the size of the gauge so you know what tubing to buy. You can buy a wire gauge tool from your local hardware store. You don\u2019t need to strip the insulation off of the wire if it already has it since the heat shrink tubing will go around it. If the wire doesn\u2019t fit in the wire gauge tool or has an irregular shape, then you can also use a ruler or tape measure to find the diameter."

Divide the diameter of the shrink tubing by the first number in the ratio to find its shrunken diameter. Calculate which tubing will shrink to a size smaller than the diameter of your wire to ensure that it has a tight seal. For example, if the original diameter of the tubing is \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) and it has a 2:1 shrink ratio, then it will become \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) once you heat it. If it had a 3:1 ratio, then it would be \u20446 inch (0.42 cm) after you shrink it. You can buy heat shrink tubing from hardware stores or online. Get heat shrink tubing that matches the color of your wire if you want it to blend in more.Tip: Make sure the tubing has a large enough diameter so you can slide it over any wires or connections to guide it into place."

You may hold the tubing over the open flame of a lighter, but it won\u2019t heat evenly and you may not have a perfect seal.
