Then, fold the top point down so it touches the bottom point. Crease and then unfold. If you don\u2019t have a square piece of paper, cut a regular piece of paper into a square with scissors. Fold the square in half diagonally from left to right and then unfold it. You want to fold the left point over so it touches the right point. Crease and then unfold. When you\u2019re done, there should be 2 perpendicular crease marks on the paper square. Fold the top point down to the center of the paper. Keep the paper turned so it still looks like a diamond. The top point should be touching the center of the paper where the 2 perpendicular creases intersect. Crease the fold. Fold the bottom point up to the top edge of the paper. The bottom point should be touching the center of the top edge. Crease the fold. Fold the bottom left and right corners up to the top edge of the paper. The corners should touch the middle of the edge, in the same spot you folded the bottom point to in the last step. After you fold the corners, crease the folds. At this point, your paper square should be starting to look like a heart. Flip the paper over and fold the points in to hide them. First, fold the left and right points in toward the middle of the paper. Then, fold the top 2 points down toward the middle of the paper. Don\u2019t fold the bottom point. Now your paper heart is finished! Flip it over again to see how it looks. Making a 2-D Heart Fold a square piece of paper in half horizontally and then unfold it. Start with the paper on a flat surface in front of you. Then, fold the top edge down so it touches the bottom edge. Crease and unfold. If you don\u2019t have a square piece of paper, use scissors to cut a regular sheet of paper into a square. Fold the paper in half vertically and then unfold it. Bring the left edge of the paper over so it touches the right edge. Crease and unfold. Fold the paper in half diagonally both ways, unfolding it after each fold. First, bring the top left corner down so it touches the bottom right corner. Crease and unfold. Then, bring the top right corner down so it touches the bottom left corner. Crease and unfold. At this point, there should be 4 long creases on the piece of paper that all intersect in the center. Fold the top and bottom edges to the center and then unfold them. Fold both edges so they meet in the center along the horizontal crease. Crease both folds and then unfold them. Fold the left and right edges to the center and then unfold them. Just like you did with the top and bottom edges, bring the left and right edges together so they meet in the center of the paper. Crease both folds and then unfold them. Rotate the paper and fold the top and bottom points to the center. You want to rotate the paper so it looks like a diamond. Bring the top point on the diamond down and the bottom point up so they touch in the center along the crease. Crease the folds. Don\u2019t unfold them. At this point, the paper should have 6 points. Fold all 6 points on the paper to the center and then flatten it. Fold the left and right points to the center of the paper. At the same time, fold the top 2 points down to the center along the existing diagonal creases. Fold the bottom 2 points up to the center along the existing diagonal creases. Crease the folds and don\u2019t unfold them. To flatten the paper, fold it in half horizontally so the top and bottom edges are going away from you. The folded crease should be facing you. Once the paper is flattened, it will start to look like a heart. Valley-fold and then mountain-fold the left point. Valley folding is when you fold a point toward you, while mountain folding is when you fold a point away from you. First, valley-fold the left point in toward the middle of the paper and crease the fold. After you make the valley fold, unfold it and mountain-fold the point back behind the paper along the crease you just made. Crease again and unfold. Turn the paper so you\u2019re facing the crease from the last fold. Hold the paper with both hands so you have a hand on each side of the crease you\u2019re looking at. Pull the sides of the paper out until you can see a square-shaped crease. The square-shaped crease should be near the center of the paper, right where you folded the left point 2 steps ago. There should be 2 perpendicular creases that intersect in the center of the square. Mountain-fold the sides of the square and then press them together. Remember, mountain folding is where you fold away from you. Once you've made 4 mountain folds \u2014 1 along each side of the square \u2014 press the left and right sides of the square together to flatten the paper. When you press the left and right sides together, the square should fold in on itself so it\u2019s tucked inside of the flattened paper.

Repeat steps 10-16 with the right side of the paper. This time, valley- and mountain-fold the right point instead of the left point.
