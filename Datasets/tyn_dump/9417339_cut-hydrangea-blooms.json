Making a cross-cut into the bottom of the stem will fix this issue and allow the stem to absorb water. Use a pair of sharp scissors to cut the underside of the stem one way, then turn the stem and make a second cut to create the cross. You can also smash the ends a bit to help the stem access water. To smash them, place the stem on its side on a hard surface, then place your palm on top of the end. Roll the stem back and forth while applying pressure with your palm.

Jeanne also conducts floral design workshops and parties throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. Jeanne Walker\t\t\tFlorist\t\t\t\tExpert Trick: When you're cutting hydrangeas, cut the stem at an angle. Then, lightly scrape the outer edges of the stem with your clippers about an inch up from the very bottom, all the way around. That will increase the surface area that the flowers can use to take in water, which will help keep it looking fresh longer."

Otherwise, you risk removing the buds that will bloom next year. Wait until fall to prune new wood hydrangeas. New wood hydrangeas bloom later than old wood hydrangeas because the younger stems take longer to reach blossoming. Their new buds will form in the winter, so don't prune later than the fall. Avoid trimming more than one-third of the plant at one time. This will revitalize your plant, though you can trim less depending on your preferences. If you prune too much, it can change the shape of your hydrangeas. Hydrangeas will often grow back to their regular size, and over-trimming can result in uncontrolled growth. Prune faded or wilting flowers using pruning shears. Dull flowers can make your plant look blah, but pruning them away will allow for new growth. When you cut away old blooms, you encourage your plant to produce more blooms. Faded or wilting flowers can be pruned at any time. Remove the brown, dead spots with pruning shears. Your plant will look better, and new growth will eventually emerge, either in this season or the next blooming season. You can prune back brown, dead spots during blooming season if you see them. This will keep your plant blooming. Trim weak branches and crossed branches using pruning shears. This will improve the look of your plant and ensure hardier growth during the next blooming season. Cut the branches where they meet another branch. Preserving Cut Flowers Boil a pot of water. Hydrangeas produce a sap that makes it hard for them to absorb water.
