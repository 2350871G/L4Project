Since mice can dehydrate quickly, it's a good idea to also put in a backup water bottle. The amount of food you need to leave depends on how many mice you have. If you have more than one, leave two extra food bowls, especially if one mouse tends to eat more than the other."

You can either ask a trusted friend to come feed your mice or hire a pet sitter. If you decide to ask a friend to watch your mice, make sure their schedule will allow them to come at least once every two days to check on your mice. Hiring a sitter is costly but ensures that your mice will be taken care of in your absence. Be sure to check references and have your sitter come over and handle the mice in front of you first to make sure it\u2019s a good fit. You can also hire a house sitter to live in your house while you\u2019re away. A house sitter will not only take care of your mouse, but also keep your house clean and safe while you\u2019re gone. Like people, mice get lonely. The females especially love the company of their owners. Try to find someone who is available to check in on your pet daily to prevent your mouse from becoming too lonesome."
