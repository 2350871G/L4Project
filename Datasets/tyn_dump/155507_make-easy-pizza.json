If you are in a rush and don't have time to go out and buy a pre-made sauce or make your own, you can always use ingredients lying around the house. For instance, spread your pizza with simple tomato sauce. If you are in a real rush, you could even use ketchup."

To speed up the process, buy pre-shredded cheese to help speed up the process.
