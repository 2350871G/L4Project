Check the hair-like tassels on the top of each ear to make sure they are yellow instead of dark brown or black. Choose as many ears of corn as you need for you and any others you're serving. The color of the kernels doesn't matter as long as the corn is fresh.Tip: Many grocery stores sell fresh corn while it's in season.

Sprinkle a pinch of salt onto the corn after the butter so it sticks to the corn. Make sure your butter isn't completely melted when you apply it or else it will drip or leak out. You can also add other spices if you want, such as pepper, cayenne, or garlic salt. Use a pinch at a time so the flavors aren't too overwhelming.
