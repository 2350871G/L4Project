For instance, the eyes are normally the main focus of the face and contain the most detail. Furthermore, a variety of different manga styles exist, and it can be helpful to study them before deciding which one appeals to you the most."

Because instructional books are normally written by a single artist, the images may be drawn in one style. To prevent unconsciously absorbing his or her style, it is best to practice for a while. With many references and guides on the Internet, you can search the basics of manga anatomy and do your best to learn them."

The directions will guide you through the process of starting from scratch and developing each essential part of the face, so you can eventually draw on your own without the book's guidance. If you attempt to cheat and skip ahead, you may have difficulties with remembering and learning the anatomy of manga.

If you enjoy that particular style, bits of that technique will eventually carry over to you. Although this method can be used as a starting point for style development, you should not solely rely upon it; otherwise, you may have difficulties with creating original designs."
