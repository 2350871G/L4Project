Mark holes to be drilled through the anti-cavitation plate. Use the mount itself as a template for this. Drill the holes for the mounting bolts. Use a drill bit sharp enough and tough enough to drill through the metal of the anti-cavitation plate. Place the mounting bracket on top of the anti-cavitation plate again.  Insert the mounting bolts and tighten them. This will secure the trolling motor. Engine-mounted trolling motors are designed only for V-hull or tri-hull boats that go \"on plane.\" They are not designed for use with pontoon boats or with sailboats.

Use a sharp bit to drill to a depth of 1/4 inch (6.5 mm) and clear out any debris after drilling. If the boat is made of fiberglass, you'll have to countersink the holes. Thread a bolt through each hole in the mount base.  Slip a rubber washer onto each bolt, underneath the mount base. You'll want to hold the washers in position with your fingers as you move the mount base over the holes you drilled in the deck. If this is too difficult, place the washers over the drilled holes. Place the base over the drilled holes, slipping the bolts through each hole.  Check to see that the base rests level against the deck surface.
