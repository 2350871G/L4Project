When placed at the bottom of your pot, however, it will serve as a buffer between the boiling water you\u2019ll be using to steam your fish and the plate you\u2019ll be steaming it on. Make sure you use a pot deep enough to hold both the cooking ring and steamer plate with the lid on. It\u2019s important that the cooking ring you use be made of metal. Plastic rings will melt and fuse to your pot in a heartbeat! If you don\u2019t have a cooking ring, you might also use a large cookie cutter or similar food-shaping utensil, provided it\u2019s also made from stainless steel.Tip: Assuming you\u2019re without a cooking ring or a cookie cutter, another thing you can do is crumple 3-4 pieces of aluminum foil into 2 in (5.1 cm) balls and use them to elevate your steamer plate."
