    "text": " Pasta Sauce with Beef Cook 1 lb. of ground beef in a frying pan. Pour a 1/2 inch (1.2 cm) layer of vegetable oil in the pan and stir the beef until it's almost browned. When it's almost ready, add in 1 finely chopped small onion and dust the beef with a light layer of garlic powder. Drain the grease from the beef. To drain the beef, tip the pan over until the grease pours out. You can keep the beef in the pan by placing a plate below the beef, which will keep the beef from falling down as the grease drips out below the plate. Mash one can of whole tomatoes with a potato masher. You can also use a fork to mash the tomatoes, but the consistency will be a bit thicker. Add 1 large can of tomato sauce and 1 small can of tomato paste to the mashed tomatoes.  Stir the tomato ingredients together.  Add one pinch of cayenne pepper, one pinch of sugar, and lightly dust the sauce with garlic powder.  Add 1/2 of a finely chopped green pepper, 5-8 finely chopped white mushrooms, and 1 finely chopped rib of celery to the sauce. Stir the ingredients together. Heat the sauce over medium-high heat until it bubbles. Then, reduce the heat. Let the sauce simmer for 15-20 minutes. This will be enough to blend the flavors and soften the veggies. Add the beef to the sauce. Stir the beef and sauce so the beef absorbs the rich and spicy flavors of the sauce. Serve. This sauce will be perfect with any pasta, especially a simple spaghetti or ravioli. Arrabbiata Pasta Sauce Heat 1 tsp. of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. You can also use a saucepan instead of a skillet. Saut\u00e9 1 cup of chopped onion and 4 cloves of minced garlic in the oil for 5 minutes. The onion and garlic should turn a bit more brown and translucent. Stir the remaining ingredients into the skillet. Stir in 3/8 cup of red wine, 1 tbsp. of white sugar, 1 tbsp. chopped fresh basil, 1 tsp. of crushed red pepper flakes, 2 tbsp. of tomato paste, 1 tbsp. of lemon juice, 1/2 tsp. of Italian seasoning, 1/4 tsp. of ground black pepper, and 2 (14.5 oz.) cans of peeled and diced tomatoes. Mix these ingredients together well so that they become more sauce-like. Bring the sauce to a boil. It should take about 3 minutes to bring these ingredients to a full boil. Reduce the heat to medium. Simmer the sauce uncovered for about 15 minutes. This will be enough time for the ingredients to blend. Stir in 2 tbsp. chopped fresh parsley. This will add a nice fresh flavor to the pasta sauce. Serve. Scoop the sauce out of the pan with a ladle and serve it over your favorite pasta. This pasta sauce is perfect for penne pasta. White Pasta Sauce Melt 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup margarine in a saucepan over medium heat. Wait until the butter and margarine have turned to liquid. Add 2 tbsp. of flour and stir. Stir the flour well with the butter. Add 2 cups of milk and 1.5 cups of half-and-half to the ingredients. Stir well. Mix 1 (15 ounce) can of chicken broth and 3 tbsp. of cornstarch in with the rest of the ingredients. Heat the ingredients to a boil. Continue to stir the ingredients without stopping. Boil the ingredients for one minute.  Remove from the heat.  Add spices and cheese to the pasta sauce. To complete your white pasta sauce, just add 1 tsp. of salt, 1/2 tsp. of crushed rosemary, 1 dash of nutmeg, 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder, and 1 1/2 cups of grated parmesan cheese to the sauce. Serve. This pasta sauce can taste great with any pasta dish, especially linguine or angel hair. You can also place grilled shrimp or other seafood over the sauce. It also works as a cream soup base.

Combine 1 cup of packed fresh basil leaves, 1/2 cup of fresh parsley, 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese, 1/4 cup of pine nuts, 1 large quartered garlic clove, and 1/4 tsp. of salt in a food processor. Cover the processor and blend the ingredients evenly. Stop frequently to scrape the sides so all of the ingredients are processed. Turn the machine setting to low.  Add 1/4 cup of olive oil and blend the ingredients. Continue to blend the ingredients until they're thick. Serve. Serve this pesto pasta sauce with fresh fettuccine, chicken, shrimp, or broccoli.",
