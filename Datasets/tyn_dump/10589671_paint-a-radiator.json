Wait until the radiator is cold to the touch before you begin painting it. Your radiator will need to stay off for a few days in order to let the primer and paint fully dry.

                    "description": "Spray paints and primers are the easiest way to paint your radiator but can be more difficult to control. Use masking tape or painters tape to completely cover and seal off the steam vent valve, the control valve, and anything else that the paint may block and damage. While the paint may not stop the valves from working, it may dry and make them more difficult to turn on again once you\u2019ve finished. For best results, avoid painting any parts that will need to move, or any openings into the radiator itself. There will likely be 2 valves on the inside of the radiator near the top that you should avoid painting over as they are used to bleed the radiator. The control valve will be on the side or top of the radiator and used to turn it on or off. If you're unsure, avoid panting anything other than the blades and top metal of the radiator."

Use a lead paint test kit, which should be available from your local hardware store, to detect any traces of lead before proceeding. Lead paints need to handled very carefully, as they can be incredibly dangerous and potentially fatal if inhaled. Use a gel-based paint stripper designed for removing lead paint, or call in a professional to remove it for you safely."

Then use a finer grit sandpaper, around 80- to 120-grit, to go over the entire radiator and smooth out the surface. This will help the primer and paint to adhere more easily and make your finished radiator look better. If you remove a lot of paint or dust from the radiator as you sand it, it may be a good idea to give it another wipe down with a clean cloth.
