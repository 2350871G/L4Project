    "text": " Mixing the Drink Measure out your ingredients. Use a measuring cup for each ingredient to make sure you have the right amount for the recipe. Measure out 1/4 cup (59 mL) Galliano, 1/4 cup (59 mL) triple sec, 1/4 cup (59 mL) dry gin, 1/4 cup (59 mL) milk, and 1/4 cup (50 g) of sugar. Pour all of these ingredients into a cocktail shaker.

Put the lid on the shaker. Then, shake all of the ingredients in the cocktail shaker. Shake for at least 10 seconds. All of the ingredients should be thoroughly mixed when you are done. Serving the White Cadillac Chill a cocktail glass. This cocktail is best served in a chilled cocktail glass. To chill a cocktail glass, pour cold water and ice into the glass. Let the ice and water sit in the glass for 5 to 10 minutes. Then, pour out the water and ice, dry the glass with a towel, and your glass is chilled and ready for a cocktail. Strain the mixture into a chilled cocktail glass. Once you\u2019ve shaken the mixture well, use a strainer to pour the mixture into a chilled cocktail glass. Many cocktail shakers come with a strainer, but you can use a separate strainer if your shaker does not have one. Add chocolate shavings to the drink. The drink is ready now, but you can add some extra flavor and decoration by adding chocolate shavings. Choose the chocolate of your choice. White chocolate is the closest to the flavor of the cocktail, but a milk or dark chocolate will add an extra punch of color and flavor. Sprinkle a handful of the shavings over the drink. Serve while still cold. Serve or enjoy the drink as soon as you are finished making it. Add extra ice if you find that is not as cold as you\u2019d like it to be. Repeat the process for more than one drink. The first mixture creates enough beverage for one cocktail. If you need to make more than one cocktail, repeat the process. Repeat until you\u2019ve made the desired amount of cocktails. Trying Variations of the Recipe Use a three ingredient recipe. A simpler White Cadillac recipe involves just three ingredients\u2014white cr\u00e8me de cacao, triple sec, and cream. Pour 1/4 cup (59 mL) of each ingredient into a shaker, add ice, shake it up, and strain into a cocktail glass. This recipe tastes best with fresh cream. Use brown cacao for a darker and richer drink. Instead of using white cr\u00e8me de cacao for the three ingredient recipe, use Cacao Brown. This will create a drink that is darker in color and richer than the original recipe. Use slightly less than the recommended 1/4 cup (59 mL) if you worry that the drink will taste too much like chocolate. Try vodka as the alcoholic ingredient.
