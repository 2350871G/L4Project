You might want to count your rainbow bands to make sure you have enough of the colors you want. If your run out it will be noticeable in your finished bracelet. You will need 25 to 30 bands total for this bracelet. Organize your bands in an organizing case, so you can separate all the different colors. If you don't have a rainbow loom organizing case, you can just as easily use a bead organizer or a jewelry box with lots of compartments."

Decide whether you want the whole bracelet to be the same color or if you want to make a pattern with more than one. You could alternate colors or incorporate every color of the rainbow. You might want to count your rainbow bands to make sure you have enough of the colors you want. If your run out it will be noticeable in your finished bracelet. You will need 25 to 30 bands total for this bracelet. Organize your bands in an organizing case, so you can separate all the different colors. If you don't have a rainbow loom organizing case, you can just as easily use a bead organizer or a jewelry box with lots of compartments. Place the first band inside the C-clip. That's the little clear plastic clip that's used to connect the ends of the bracelet. Pull the first rubber band into the space in the \"C\" so that it stays inside the clip. Slide the band over a pencil. Take the same band and stretch it a little so you can slide it down to the middle of a pencil.

You can also use a popsicle stick or a chopstick if you don't have a pencil handy. Slip a second band under the first band. Rest the pencil on the table in front of you so that the first band is sticking up. Now pinch the second band and slip it under the first band. The pinched second band should be perpendicular to the pencil. Loop the ends of the second band around your finger. When you pull up the two ends of the second band, they'll form two loops that are separated by the first rubber band. Take these two loops and loop them around your pointer finger. Slide the first band off of the pencil. That first band has done its job, so you can slide it right off to make way for the next part of the pattern. Slip the pencil through the 2 loops of the second band. Transfer the loops that you're holding with your finger onto the pencil. Slip them down to the middle of the pencil so they won't fall off. Slip a third band under the second band. Take the third color you're using, pinch the band to make it flat, and slip it under the two loops of the second band that are around the pencil. Bring up the two loops of the third band and slip them onto your pointer finger to hold them in place. Slide the second band off of the pencil. Carefully slip the loops off so that the second band becomes part of the chain. Are you seeing the pattern start to form? Slip the pencil through the 2 loops of the third band.

You can make this pattern with just one color, but it looks great with 2 or 3. You'll need about 50 bands total, so count up to make sure you have enough of each color.

        "The pencil will help you hold the pattern in place as you create it, taking the place of a loom.",
        "Use a pencil that's narrow enough so that the band fits over it loosely.",
        "If the band is too tight, it'll be hard to slip it off the pencil, which you'll need to do as you create your pattern.",
        "You can also use a popsicle stick or a chopstick if you don't have a pencil handy.",
        "Slip a second band under the first band.",
        "Rest the pencil on the table in front of you so that the first band is sticking up.",
        "Now pinch the second band and slip it under the first band.",
        "The pinched second band should be perpendicular to the pencil.",
        "Loop the ends of the second band around your finger.",
        "When you pull up the two ends of the second band, they'll form two loops that are separated by the first rubber band.",
        "Take these two loops and loop them around your pointer finger.",
        "Slide the first band off of the pencil.",
        "That first band has done its job, so you can slide it right off to make way for the next part of the pattern.",
        "Slip the pencil through the 2 loops of the second band.",
        "Transfer the loops that you're holding with your finger onto the pencil.",
        "Slip them down to the middle of the pencil so they won't fall off.",
        "Slip a third band under the second band.",
        "Take the third color you're using, pinch the band to make it flat, and slip it under the two loops of the second band that are around the pencil.",
        "Bring up the two loops of the third band and slip them onto your pointer finger to hold them in place.",
        "Slide the second band off of the pencil.",
        "Carefully slip the loops off so that the second band becomes part of the chain.",
        "Are you seeing the pattern start to form?",
        "Slip the pencil through the 2 loops of the third band.",
        "Transfer the loops that you're holding with your finger onto the pencil.",
        "Slip them down to the middle of the pencil so they won't fall off.",
        "Keep going until you've created a bracelet-sized chain.",
        "Continue the pattern of slipping a new band under the loops of the old band, putting them on your finger, sliding the old band off the pencil and slipping the pencil under the new bands.",
        "As the chain grows, you can periodically wrap it around your wrist (or your finger, if you want to make a ring) to see if it's long enough.",
        "Finish the bracelet.",
        "Slip the last band off the pencil and hold the loops with your fingers.",
        "Take the C-clip and insert the two loops into its center.",
        "Now the two ends of the bracelet are joined together, and the bracelet is complete.",
        "Try it on to see if you like the size.",
        "If you want it to be smaller, just pull out the last few bands until it's the right length, then rejoin the ends with the C-clip.",
        "To make a longer bracelet, slip the 2 loops of the last band back over the pencil, then add new bands as needed.",
        "Fishtail Choose at least 2 band colors.",
        "This pattern looks great with alternating colors, so choose your favorites.",
        "You can also make a fishtail using more than 2 colors if you'd like.",
        "Since this is a tighter pattern, you'll need about 50 bands total.",
        "Twist the first band around two pencils.",
        "Hold the pencils together so that the eraser ends are facing up.",
        "Now take your first rubber band and twist it around the pencils so that it makes a figure 8 around them, with one loop around each pencil.",
        "Scoot the figure 8 down the pencils a little to make sure it won't slip off.",
        "Slip 2 more bands over the pencils.",
        "This time, don't twist them \u2014 simply slide them over both pencils.",
        "You should end up with a little stack: first comes the twisted band, then a couple more bands that are slipped over both pencils.",
        "Remember to alternate your colors.",
        "The third band should be the same color as the first one, with an alternating color in between.",
        "Bring in the loops of the first band.",
        "Start by holding the pencils so that they're facing you.",
        "Now use your fingernails to grasp the right loop of the first band (the twisted one).",
        "Pull it up over the other bands and over the tip of the pencil, then let it drop in between the pencils.",
        "Now do the same with the left loop of the first band: grasp it with your fingers, pull it up over the other bands and the tip of the pencil, then let it drop in between the pencils.",
        "Slip another band over the pencils.",
        "Don't twist it, just slip it around both pencils and scoot it down so that it's resting on top of the last band.",
        "Make sure to use your contrasting color.",
        "Bring in the loops of the lowest band.",
        "Hold the pencils to that they're facing you.",
        "Now use your fingernails to grasp the right loop of the lowest band.",
        "Pull it up over the other bands and over the tip of the pencil, then let it drop in between the pencils.",
        "Now do the same with the left loop of the lowest band: grasp it with your fingers, pull it up over the other bands and the tip of the pencil, then let it drop in between the pencils.",
        "Keep going until the fishtail is long enough to make a bracelet.",
        "Keep adding a band to the top and bringing in the loops of the lowest band.",
        "Each time you do this, another segment of the bracelet will form.",
        "Keep going until the fishtail is as long as you want it to be.",
        "To figure out when it's long enough to make a bracelet, wrap the fishtail around your wrist.",
        "It's ready when the two ends are long enough to meet.",
        "You can also stop after just a few segments if you want a fishtail ring.",
        "Finish the bracelet.",
        "When it's as long as you want it, carefully slip the final loops off of the pencils.",
        "Use a C-clip to hold all of the loose loops together.",
        "Finally, pull up the first loop from the beginning of the bracelet and connect it to the other end by slipping it into the C-clip.",
        "Your bracelet is complete.",
        "If you want the bracelet to be longer, just loop the last few bands back over the pencils.",
        "Keep adding bands and bringing in the bottom loops until it's long enough, then fasten the ends together with the C-clip.",
        "If it's too long, you can just pull out the last few bands until it's the right length, then fasten the ends with the C-clip.",
        "Chevron Choose your colors.",
        "You can make this pattern with just one color, but it looks great with 2 or 3.",
        "You'll need about 50 bands total, so count up to make sure you have enough of each color.",
        "Loop the first band around the tines of a fork.",
        "Hold a fork so that the handle is up and the tines are facing you.",
        "This will act as your loom.",
        "Take the first band and loop it around the outer right tine.",
        "Lift it with your finger and thumb.",
        "Twist and loop the band across the tines of the fork.",
        "Take the looped band and twist it.",
        "Loop the end of the band over the next tine in line.",
        "Then pull the end toward you, twist it, and loop it over the next tine in line.",
        "Finally, pull it out once more, twist it, and loop it over the last tine.",
        "This sounds tricky, but once you get the hang of it you'll be able to do it really quickly.",
        "If you need help handling the tiny band, you can use a crochet hook to help you pull it out and twist it.",
        "Once the band is twisted around all of the tines, push it down a bit so that the twists are in an even line.",
        "Pull on either end to adjust the band so that all the twists are the same size.",
        "Loop a second band around the tines of the fork.",
        "Using the exact same technique, add a second band.",
        "Choose the next one in your pattern, whether it's the same color or a different one.",
        "Loop it around the outer right tine, twist it, loop it over the next tine, twist it, loop it over the next one, twist it, then loop it over the last tine.",
        "Push it down so that it's stacked up against the first band.",
        "Weave the loops.",
        "Orient the fork so that the tines are pointing down.",
        "Take a look at the outer right tine of the fork: you'll see a stack of two loops.",
        "Take the top loop (the one closer to the handle of the fork) and pull it over the bottom loop and over the tip of the fork tine.",
        "Do the same with the other tines: take the top loops and pull them over the tips of the tines.",
        "Loop a new band around the tines.",
        "Take the next color in your pattern, loop it over the outer right tine of the fork, twist it, then loop and twist it around the remaining tines.",
        "Now you have a stack of 2 looped bands on the fork again.",
        "Weave the loops.",
        "With the fork oriented so that the tines are pointing down, look at the outer right tine.",
        "Take the top loop (the once closer to the handle of the fork) and pull it over the bottom loop and over the tip of the tine.",
        "Do the same with the other tines: take the top loops and pull them over the tips of the tines.",
        "Keep going until the chevron bracelet is as long as you want it.",
        "Loop the next band in your pattern around the tines, then weave the loops by taking the top loop on each tine and pull it up and over the tips of the tines.",
        "Keep adding new bands and weaving the loops until the bracelet is big enough to fit your wrist.",
        "Finish the bracelet.",
        "Transfer the remaining loops from the fork to your finger, then hook them into a C-clip to hold them all together.",

        "Your bracelet is complete."
