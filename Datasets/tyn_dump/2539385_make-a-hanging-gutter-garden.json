Then add the screws to keep the guttering firmly in place. The exact type and method of attachment will depend on the material you're attaching to, as if varies between wood, brick, veneer and other surfaces. If you're not sure, simply ask at the hardware store for precise advice. Try this alternative: Use the frame of a pallet and attach the gutter lengths to the frame, on the inside.
