To test one, look for a Bunchem that doesn't have as much hair surrounding it and tug the ball lightly. If it gives or starts to loosen, try to work it out with your fingers. Stop as soon as you begin having trouble pulling it out. You don't want to break the hair."

Use your hands to work the product into the strands wrapped around the ball, along with the hair immediately surrounding the area. Continue rubbing in the product until the hair is completely saturated. The amount of product you'll need depends on how many Bunchems you have to remove and how large the balls are. Bigger Bunchems require more product. You can also use an old toothbrush to scrub the product into the hair on the ball.

After you apply it, run a comb through the strands below the Bunchem to work out any knotted areas. If you have thick hair, use a wide-tooth comb. For thin hair, you can go with a fine-tooth comb. Don't tug or pull at knots too hard. If you have trouble combing through a tangle, start at the very end of the hair, untangling section by section as you work your way up the strand towards the root."

Scrub the shampoo into the strands thoroughly to break up any remaining product, then rinse it out with warm water. Use a scented shampoo if you used a smelly product, like WD-40 or peanut butter. If there's still product or an oily feel to your hair after you wash it, you may need to shampoo it 1 to 2 more times."
