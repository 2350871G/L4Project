Before you begin working with it, put on a pair of rubber gloves and safety glasses to avoid exposure from splashes or spills, and wear a face mask to keep from inhaling the fumes. Be sure to work in a well-ventilated area as well. Open up windows and use fans to increase circulation if you\u2019re working indoors."
