        "Again, pair your pieces together according to fabric.",
        "For each type, take a circle of the same fabric as your rectangle and pin its edges along one of the rectangle\u2019s long sides, keeping their right sides together.",
        "Then sew the two together with a seam allowance between a quarter- and half-inch (0.64 and 1.27 cm).",
        "Once you have sewn the entire circle along the rectangle\u2019s long side, finish by sewing the rectangle\u2019s two short ends together.",
        "The seam allowance refers to the distance between the edge of the fabric and the seam that you are sewing.",
        "The heavier the fabric, the larger your seam allowance should be.",
        "When sewing, remove each pin as you come to it.",
        "Begin pinning your bottom circle.",
        "For each fabric, the first circle that you sewed all the way around your rectangle is now the top of that bag.",
        "Now move on to its bottom.",
        "With each bag, take the second circle of the same fabric and pin the edges along the rectangle\u2019s long side, as you did with the top circle.",
        "This time, however, stop short of pinning all the way around.",
        "Leave enough room for your zipper.",
        "The zipper isn\u2019t strictly necessary for the inner bag.",
        "If you\u2019d rather do without one, simply sew the bottom circle to the rectangle as you did with the top.",
        "Only this time, leave an open gap roughly 24 to 36 inches (0.61 to 0.91 m) long.",
        "Later, once you are done stuffing the filler inside the bag through that gap, sew it shut.",
        "That said, if you are using expanding foam, a zipper is strongly advised.",
        "This way you don\u2019t have to sew the gap shut as the foam expands inside the bag.",
        "Add your zipper and sew.",
        "For each bag, use one that is at least 48 inches (1.22 m) long.",
        "Zip it all the way shut, then unzip it about a finger\u2019s length at most.",
        "Pair the right side of one half with the right side of your bottom circle and then pin them together.",
        "Then pair the other half\u2019s right side with the right side of your rectangle, and do the same.",
        "Continue unzipping the zipper a little bit at a time, pinning its halves to the bottom circle and rectangle as you go, until you reach the end.",
        "Start sewing the zipper first, using your sewing machine\u2019s zipper foot, with a seam allowance of a quarter inch (0.61 cm).",
        "Once the zipper is sewn to both the bottom circle and the rectangle, sew the circle and rectangle together as you did with the first circle.",
        "Fill your bags.",
        "If you are using an alternate filler, like packing peanuts, simply pour it into the inner bag through the open zipper or gap.",
        "If you are using expanding foam, place the sealed package inside the inner bag.",
        "Then slit it open, remove the packaging, and zip the bag shut as the foam expands.",
        "If you didn\u2019t use a zipper for the inner bag, pin and sew the gap shut once your filler is inside.",
        "Once your inner bag is sealed, stuff it into your cover, zip your cover shut, and you\u2019re done!"
