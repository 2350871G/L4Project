Check the fish for pin bones and use tweezers to pull them out. Melt the butter over medium heat and lay the fish in a saut\u00e9 pan. Put 2 1/2 tablespoons (35 g) of unsalted butter into a large saut\u00e9 pan and turn the burner to medium. Let the butter melt and foam a little. Then lay both fillets in the pan. Leave at least 1/2 in (1.3 cm) of space in between the fillets. Sprinkle the scallions over the fish and cook the fillets for 2 minutes. Thinly slice 3 scallions and spread them evenly over the fillets in the pan. Leave the fish to cook over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Use a spoon to ladle the scallion butter sauce over the tops of the fillets as they cook. Avoid turning or moving the fish while it saut\u00e9s. Flip the fish and cook it over low heat for 2 minutes. Use a spatula to carefully flip each fillet over and turn the burner to low. Put a lid on the pan and leave the fish to cook for 2 minutes. Add the fresh herbs and cook the fish for 1 more minute. Remove the lid and scatter 1 1/2 tablespoons (4.5 g) of finely chopped fresh chives, mint, or sorrel along with 1 tablespoon (2.5 g) of fresh minced thyme and 2 teaspoons (1.5 g) of finely chopped fresh tarragon, basil or marjoram. Leave the lid off and cook the fish until it flakes easily. Feel free to use your favorite herbs or whatever herbs you have on hand. Serve the fillets with the pan sauce and lemon juice. Transfer each fillet to serving plates and pour the sauce that's left in the pan over the fish. Take 1/2 of a lemon and squeeze the juice over the fish. Consider serving the fish with steamed rice, roasted vegetables, or crusty bread. Store the leftover fish fillets in an airtight container for up to 3 or 4 days. Pan-Frying Crispy Fillets Dry the fish and cut each fillet lengthwise into 2 pieces. Use paper towels to pat each side of the fish until they're completely dry. Use a sharp knife to slice each fillet into 2 smaller pieces. Sprinkle the fish with a pinch of salt and pepper. Cutting the fish lengthwise will help them cook evenly. Try using cod, tilapia, halibut, or rockfish. Set up a dredging station of flour, egg, and breadcrumbs. Lay 3 shallow dishes on the counter next to your stove. Put 4 tablespoons (30 g) of flour into 1 dish. Crack 2 eggs into another dish and whisk the eggs until they're combined. Measure 4 tablespoons (30 g) of bread crumbs into the last shallow dish.

Turn off the burner and put the fish fillets on serving plates. Sprinkle the fish with a little salt and pepper according to your taste. Cut 1 lemon into 4 wedges and put a wedge on each plate. Avoid storing the pan-fried fillets because they'll become soggy as they're refrigerated. Baking Fillets with Lemon Cream Sauce Preheat the oven to 390 \u00b0F (199 \u00b0C) and season the fish. If you prefer lightly seasoned fish, sprinkle just a few pinches of salt and pepper over each fillet. For more heavily seasoned fish, try 1/4 teaspoon (1.5 g) of salt and 1/4 teaspoon (0.5 g) of pepper. Arrange the fillets in a baking dish.

If your fish fillets are thicker than 1/2 in (1.3 cm), add a few minutes to the baking time. Use tilapia, halibut, cod, silver dory, or rockfish. Put the butter, cream, garlic, mustard, and lemon juice in a bowl. Measure 5 tablespoons (50 g) of unsalted butter, \u20444 cup (59 ml) of heavy cream, 1 to 2 cloves of minced garlic, 1 tablespoon (22.5 g) of Dijon mustard, and 1 \u20442 tablespoons (22 ml) of lemon juice into a microwave-safe bowl or measuring jug. Microwave the sauce ingredients for 1 minute. Heat the lemon cream sauce ingredients in the microwave for 30 seconds and then stir the sauce. Microwave it for another 30 seconds and stir it again. The sauce should be completely smooth and melted. Mince the shallots and scatter them over the fish. Peel 1 shallot and use a sharp knife to chop it very finely. Sprinkle 1 1/2 tablespoons (15 g) evenly over the fish fillets in the baking dish. Pour the sauce over the fillets and bake them for 10 to 12 minutes. The fish will turn opaque when it's finished cooking. If you can't tell, take a fork and gently drag the tines across the center of a fillet. The fish will flake once it's finished cooking. If the fish isn't done, return it to the oven and check it again in 2 minutes. Thicker fish may need more time. Serve the baked fish with fresh parsley and lemon slices.
