Outdoors is usually the best place to work due to the mess and fumes. If you will be working indoors, lay down newspaper and open a window. Lay empty egg cartons on top of the newspaper or flat surface area where you will be painting. The empty egg cartons will be used to hold the golf balls while you work so that they remain steady and you can keep one hand free. Sandpaper the surface of each golf ball. This will remove the gloss from the ball and any residual dirt. Golf balls have a layer of gloss on the surface that can keep paint from sticking, so it's important to make sure all the gloss is removed. After sandpapering each ball, brush off any extra sand or dust. Spray a paint primer on the balls. This is easiest to do while the balls are sitting on the upside-down egg carton. This will help to give the paint a better hold and will also help the colors look more vibrant. Allow the primer to fully dry before moving on. Coat the ball with red paint.

You don't have to make a lot of black spots. Just a few will look great. Paint two small white rings inside the head of the ladybug. These will be the eyes, so put them towards the top half of the head close to the wings. At this point the design is complete, so wait for the ball to dry. Add varnish to protect your new ladybug golf balls from rain and weathering. Apply the varnish with a clean brush and allow it to sit. Once the varnish is dry you can start putting them around your garden or in your flower beds. Try to keep them in shaded areas to avoid the color from fading quickly in the sunlight.",
