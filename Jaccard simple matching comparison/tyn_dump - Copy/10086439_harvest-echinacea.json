It is important that you do not harvest anything from your plant until after the flowers have bloomed at least 1 time, and then wait for them to bloom again to harvest them. This will help to ensure that the plant is tough enough to withstand harvesting and has an established root system. Harvest the flower while it's in bloom and before it starts to fade. Keep in mind that echinacea is a valuable garden addition even before you harvest it. It attracts butterflies, provides seed for birds, and repels deer from your garden."
