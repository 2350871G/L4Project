Lavenders in general are drought tolerant, but don\u2019t handle the cold very well. If you live in a climate where the winters are very hard, you can still grow lavender plants, but you will probably have to treat them like annuals and replace them each year. Uses for lavender include landscaping, dried buds, culinary, crafts, fresh cuttings, and essential oils. There are different varieties that fit each of these uses differently."
