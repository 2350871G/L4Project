Lay the tortillas on a work surface and put about 1/2 cup (62 g) of the chopped chicken on each.

If you'd like to include minced cilantro, put about 1 tablespoon (15 ml) (4 g) on each wrap. Fold each tortilla to secure the ends and side. Bring 2 sides of the tortilla up so the filling settles in the center. Then tuck the ends of the tortilla towards the center. Hold these in place and use your thumbs to roll a long side of the tortilla over the filling. Keep rolling the wrap over so it's completely closed. Heat a grill pan and cook the wraps for a few minutes on each side. Put a grill pan on the stove and turn the burner to medium or heat a small grill to medium. Spread a little oil or cooking spray on the grill so your wraps don't stick and place the wraps on the hot grill. Cook them for 1 to 2 minutes on each side. The tortilla will become crisp and golden brown once it's grilled long enough. Slice and serve the chicken ranch wraps. Turn the burner off and put the wraps on serving plates. Cut each wrap in half and serve them immediately. Store the leftover wraps in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 to 3 days. Keep in mind that the wrap will become softer as it's stored. Making Healthy Chicken Avocado Wraps with Yogurt Sauce Mix the yogurt, mustard, honey, salt, and pepper to make the sauce. Measure 1 cup (245 g) of plain yogurt into a bowl and whisk in 1 teaspoon (5 g) of mustard, and 2 teaspoons (14 g) of honey. Taste the sauce and add salt and pepper according to your taste. Set the sauce aside while you make the chicken wraps. Warm 4 whole-wheat tortillas or chapati. To make the tortillas or chapatis easier to wrap, heat them in the oven, microwave, or skillet just until they're warm enough to bend easily. Divide chicken, veggies, and avocado between the wraps. Lay the 4 warm tortillas on your work surface and place 1/2 cup (62 g) of chicken on each wrap. Lay 1 lettuce leaf, a few of the halved cherry tomatoes, long cucumber slices, and a few slivers of avocado on each wrap. Cut the cucumber lengthwise into thin slices. Drizzle sauce over the filling and fold the tortillas into wraps. Top the wrap fillings with a few spoonfuls of the yogurt sauce. To fold the wraps, tuck the ends of each tortilla towards the center. Then fold 1 side over the filling and keep rolling until the wrap is enclosed. Serve the wraps with more yogurt sauce. Leave the wraps whole or slice them in half before serving. Offer more of the yogurt sauce on the side for dipping or drizzling. Refrigerate the leftover wraps in an airtight container for up to 2 to 3 days. Creating Spicy Buffalo Chicken Wraps Saut\u00e9 \u20442 pound (230 g) of cubed chicken for 6 minutes. Heat \u20442 teaspoon (2.5 ml) of canola or vegetable oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken breast to the skillet and cook it until it's almost cooked throughout. Stir the chicken frequently as it cooks to prevent it from sticking to the pan. Stir in the hot sauce and simmer the chicken for 3 to 5 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of Louisiana-style hot sauce into the skillet and keep heating the chicken until the sauce begins to bubble. Stir and cook the chicken until it reaches 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C) according to an instant-read meat thermometer. Turn off the burner. Keep the skillet uncovered so the sauce thickens as it cooks.
