If you find any brown or wilted areas, cut them off using pruning shears. Damaged areas will take away vital nutrients from the rest of your plant. Removing the Suckers Follow the main vine up the plant to find the suckers. Cucumber plants grow long, skinny vines early in their blooming season. The vine runs down the center of the plant. Locate your main vines so you can find the suckers, which grow laterally off the main vines. Get rid of 4-6 suckers growing from the bottom of the cucumber plant. Suckers are the small lateral stems that grow off the main vine. Either pinch them off with your fingers or cut them off with your pruning shears. Prune them away at the base of the stem, and make your cut at a 45-degree angle. To identify the sucker, look for the fuzzy, floral-like end coming off of the main plant stem. If you leave the suckers on the plant, you will have a smaller overall yield and may grow smaller cucumbers. Cut off any damaged or unhealthy cucumbers using pruning shears.

When pruning, only cut off the suckers. The stems of the cucumber grow leaves and flowers as part of its natural growing cycle. If you cut off the flowers, your plant will not grow cucumbers. Training the Vines Train your plants as soon as the flowers first appear if using a trellis. When you first see flowers, your plants are mature enough to begin training. Trellises are a good idea if you don\u2019t have a ton of room in your garden or want to keep your plants off the ground. If you train your plants too early, their stems may grow unevenly. Secure the main vine to the trellis with gardening clips. To train your plants to grow on a trellis, you have to attach the vines to it as they grow.
