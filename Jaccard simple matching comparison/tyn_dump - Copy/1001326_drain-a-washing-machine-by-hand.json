        "If you\u2019re worried about scratching up your floor, lift the front end of your machine so a partner can lay a dropcloth, blanket, or similar material underneath.",
        "Then do the same with the back, if possible.",
        "Once you\u2019re ready, slowly pull the machine away from the wall.",
        "Stop once you\u2019re able to reach the drain hose in back.",
        "Don\u2019t pull it out so far that you end up yanking any hoses out of the wall.",
        "If the machine\u2019s too heavy for you to move, open the lid.",
        "Use a pitcher or similar container to ladle water out into your bucket.",
        "Empty as much water as you like this way, or just until the machine\u2019s light enough for you to move.",
        "If you\u2019re working by yourself and the machine\u2019s still too heavy even after you\u2019ve ladled out as much water as you can, ask a partner to help you.",
        "Detach the drain hose from the wall.",
        "Uncouple the drain hose where it meets the drainage pipe inside your wall.",
        "Be careful to keep that end of the hose raised higher than the machine itself as you do.",
        "Expect gravity to start pumping water out of the hose before you\u2019re ready if you lower it.",
        "You\u2019ll need to do this even if you ladled all the water out of the machine\u2019s inner drum.",
        "There is still water underneath that, which you can\u2019t reach through the top of the machine.",
        "Fill your bucket.",
        "Avoid spills by feeding the hose\u2019s open end inside the bucket before setting the bucket on the floor.",
        "As the hose lowers, water will start pumping out on its own, so keep an eye on the bucket\u2019s water level as it rises.",
        "Once it fills as much as you\u2019d like, simply raise the hose\u2019s open end above the machine to stop the flow.",
        "Drain the bucket and repeat until no more water comes out.",
        "Although it may be tempting to use the largest bucket possible and fill it all the way up, remember the distance you have to carry it.",
        "Only empty as much at a time that you can safely carry without sloshing any over the sides.",
        "Alternately, you can simply aim the hose\u2019s open end over a floor drain or into a bathtub if there\u2019s one within its reach.",
        "Finish draining the last of the water into a bottle.",
        "To completely drain your machine, lower the hose to floor level.",
        "The rim of your bucket or bathtub is probably too high for this, so switch to a gallon-size jug or bottle.",
        "Lay it on its side and cover its mouth with the hose\u2019s open end.",
        "Drain the bottle as it fills up, and repeat until the job is done.",
        "If the hose\u2019s open end is larger than the bottle\u2019s mouth, try using a funnel to reduce spills."
