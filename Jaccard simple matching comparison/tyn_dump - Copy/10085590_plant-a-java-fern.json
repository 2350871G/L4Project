In this case, you can simply place the fern and driftwood into your aquarium as-is, since Java ferns grow best when attached to driftwood or stone. Often, the fern will be attached to the wood with a thin thread that should dissolve over time in the water. The root system of the Java fern will hold it in place."

Wrap thread or fishing line around the rhizome and the attaching object (e.g., rock or driftwood) several times, or use a zip tie or two to secure them together. After you attach the rhizome to a rock or piece of wood, the roots will eventually secure the fern to the object with a strong bond. Unless you\u2019re using a dissolving thread, you should remove the binding object (e.g., fishing line or zip tie) once the roots gain a firm hold on the rock or wood.

Read the product packaging carefully so that you get the right kind of glue and apply it properly. Because the glue doesn\u2019t wrap around the rhizome like zip ties or fishing line do, the rhizome (and fern) can continue to grow without restriction."
