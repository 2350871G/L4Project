Instead of drawing the outline of your object, try starting by sketching a well-balanced separation of light and dark areas. Approach shadows as you would a flat, graphic shapes. Some may be darker than others, but within individual shadows there should be a minimum of contrast and texture. Use the side of your charcoal pencil to create these shadow shapes, rather than scribbling in lines. Transition from shadows to highlights with halftones. Here, create gradations of contrast with darks from the shadow side and lights from the highlights. Your highlights may have some texture, depending on the material. There may also be areas without any texture."
