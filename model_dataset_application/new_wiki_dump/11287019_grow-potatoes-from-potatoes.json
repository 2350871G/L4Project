Pick a spot in your garden where the plants will be exposed to sunlight but not baking in the heat. They prefer summer temperatures of roughly 70 \u00b0F (21 \u00b0C), but can handle slightly hotter temps, as long as they\u2019re not exposed to direct sunlight for more than 6-8 hours a day. Plant in late spring for ideal conditions. Expert gardeners recommend planting potatoes around the time of last expected frost, but that time can vary based on where you live."

Regular potatoes from a grocery store are often treated with pesticides which can spread disease through your whole crop, so either order your seeding potatoes from a catalog or hit the garden store. Seed potatoes come in every variation\u2014russet, Yukon, fingerling, you name it.

Place your seed potatoes in any warm, dry spot (a bowl on your kitchen counter where the sun shines will do) and leave them for a week. One week is ample time for your sprouts to grow between \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) and \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) in length. That means they\u2019re almost ready to be planted."
