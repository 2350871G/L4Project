A player earns two points for each picture card (Jack, Queen, King) of their target suit that a player has \"Yoinked\". The rest of the cards that match the target suit are worth one point. If a player holds all three picture cards matching their target suit, they earn a bonus four points. If a player has five consecutive non-picture cards that all match their target suit, they earn a bonus five points. Jokers can be used as wild cards  and  they are not worth any points, but they can take the place of any non-picture card in order to claim this bonus. The cards that do not match the player's target suit are worth nothing. For example, if a player's target suit is Spades and he holds the three, four, six, seven, jack, queen, king and ace of Spades, and a joker, he scores four points for the normal cards, six points for the picture cards, three points for the ace, plus a five point straight bonus (the joker acts as a five) and a four point bonus for holding the three picture cards."

  "text":" Remove the four twos from a standard deck of cards. Ideally, the deck should include jokers, but this is not necessary. Shuffle the deck.  Shuffle the four twos and place them face down onto the table.  Invite the three other players to take one of the twos. They are allowed to look at it, but they are not allowed to show it to anyone else. You keep the two that wasn't chosen by any of the other players. Explain to each player that the suit of the two they have just chosen is their target suit, and that they score points for each card they finish with of this suit.  Pick up the deck and start to deal cards face up onto a pile on the table, at a rate of about one card a second. While you are doing this, explain to the rest of the players that once they are satisfied that there are enough cards matching their target suit in the pile of face up cards, they must say \"Yoink\" and place their hand over the pile. Wait until a player does this. Remember that you are also playing, so you may do this, too. Give the cards in the pile to the first person to say \"Yoink\". If two players say \"Yoink\" at the same time, the player whose hand is lowest takes the cards. Explain that this player has finished playing this round and can no longer take any cards.  Pick up the deck again and start dealing cards until another player (or you) says \"Yoink\". Give the pile of cards to this player. Like before, this player has finished playing the round. Start dealing cards again until another player \"Yoinks\" the cards. The remainder of the deck goes to the player who didn't \"Yoink\" any cards.
