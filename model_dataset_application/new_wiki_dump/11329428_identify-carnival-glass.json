Do this in a light area, as dark rooms can make the piece look like ordinary glass.

In order to find a place like this, flip the piece over and check the raised base on the very bottom. Genuine antique carnival glass was sprayed by hand, so the base, where the worker would hold or rest the piece on a surface, often lacks the oily reflection."

However, experts on carnival glass have categorized almost 50 different colors that the vintage pieces can have. For an initial look at a piece, you only need to describe the basic color.
