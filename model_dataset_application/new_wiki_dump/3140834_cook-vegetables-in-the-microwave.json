It is generally a good idea to cook vegetables separately so that nothing is over- or under-cooked. However, if you must mix them up, cut the vegetable that requires more cooking into smaller chunks. For example, if cooking potatoes and cauliflower together, make sure that the potato chunks are much smaller than the cauliflower florets. In the case of corn on the cob, keep the husk on. Because corn is a grain, the loss of water results in starchier, firmer corn. The husk helps prevent this loss of moisture. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/45\\/Microwave-Corn-in-Its-Husk-Step-3.jpg\\/v4-459px-Microwave-Corn-in-Its-Husk-Step-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/45\\/Microwave-Corn-in-Its-Husk-Step-3.jpg\\/aid3140834-v4-728px-Microwave-Corn-in-Its-Husk-Step-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":306,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"485\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"
