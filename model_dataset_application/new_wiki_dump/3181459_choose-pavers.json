          "description":"Use your favorite online search engine to find landscaping contractors in your area. Call at least three to five to compare the prices of parts and labor and their estimated timelines for finishing the project. You should also ask them for client referrals on past projects, and double check that they\u2019re a licensed contractor or business that has worker's compensation insurance. They should also be liability insured. Don\u2019t be afraid to haggle! Prices are rarely set in stone. Ask them if they have special off-season or end-of-season rates. Your price tag will vary depending on where you live and how big your patio is. However, installing brick pavers for a 120-square foot (11-square meter) patio in an average town in the United States should cost between about $1,200-$1,800, or about $10-$16 per square foot (0.09 square meter). Concrete may be slightly cheaper, costing between about $8-$15 per square foot (0.09 square meters)."

          "headline":"Choose pavers that work for your climate.",
          "description":"Brick is a porous substance, and may break down more quickly than concrete in areas with a lot of rain, heat, or wind. If you live in a moderate climate, however, brick is likely to weather well. Concrete and stone hold up better in harsh climates. If you live somewhere with extreme weather conditions, look for brick designed for inclement weather. If you live in a harsh climate but love the look of brick or limestone, go for it! You may simply need to work paver replacements into your yearly house budget. The cost of replacement will depend on the material and the extent of the damage, but it should cost between about $300-$3,000."

          "headline":"Use sturdy material for exposed areas.",
          "description":"If your paving space is exposed to sun or weather, you will need to use a strong material, such as stone or concrete. The sun is powerful and can cause premature wearing on all types of pavers, but will quickly degrade delicate material such as limestone. If you go with a delicate material, you can apply a sealer to the pavers twice a year to protect them from damage."

          "description":"If the area you are hoping to pave is covered, your paving material will not need to be as hardy. If you are worried about sun exposure, you may want to roll the price of a patio shade into your budget. This could get pretty pricey, however, especially if you\u2019re envisioning a traditional patio roof (which could cost as much as $10,000). Retractable awnings will be less expensive, but the overall price should still be about $2,500. Talk to your landscaping contractor if you\u2019re interested in adding one of these options."

Wood, for instance, is extremely versatile and works well with everything. Metal is better suited for concrete or stone. Your existing outdoor furniture will also come into play when deciding how you want your space to look. Metal and concrete lend themselves to an industrial look, while wood and brick are more cozy."

          "description":"The width of your space will help you determine what types of paver shapes will work well in your yard. A narrow yard is not going to do well with wide pavers, as it will create the illusion of an even smaller space. A large yard may not do well with small shapes and patterns, as putting them in will be both labor and time intensive. If you have a large space, you can ease some of the financial burden by spacing your pavers and placing plants, gravel, or wood chips between them. The result is polished, but not quite as expensive. Keep in mind that the pavers may shift over time since they won't be packed together."

If you tend to gravitate toward angular shapes, simple brick pavers will work well with your space, as will octagons and pentagons. Your space does not have to match. If you like a more chaotic, free-spirited look, you can mix and match rounded and sharp edges. Just make sure the edging does its job and retains the area."

Make sure you can afford the cost of parts and labor for the initial install and replacements in the future. If your budget does not allow for your ideal pavers, try to find used or leftover pavers from a supplier, on websites like Craigslist, or at yard sales. This can be especially useful if you are paving a smaller area. It\u2019ll be harder to replace secondhand pavers, so be sure to take this into account when making your choice."

High sun exposure will not only break down materials, but will cause color fading over time, making once-vibrant hues dull. If your home has a lot of sun exposure, opt for neutral or natural tones. The staining process can also be taken into account. If your pavers are dyed concrete, fading will be difficult to cover. If your pavers are painted or coated, replacing color may be easy. Applying a sealer to the pavers twice a year will help prevent their color from fading."

If your home is a neutral color such as white or beige, most paver colors will work well. If your home is a more distinct color, such as forest green or a deep gray, be more selective with your pavers. You can also use multiple paver colors to tie in your home color and your vision for your paved space."
