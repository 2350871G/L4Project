This will give you enough time to determine if your baby has an allergy to a particular food. By isolating one food for a few days, you will be able to pinpoint the exact culprit if allergic symptoms do develop. Cook all vegetables thoroughly and be sure to mash it well to prevent choking. To make a thinner consistency, use a food processor to puree the food. Green beans, carrots, peas, and potatoes are all good first vegetarian foods. Be sure to mash fruits well before giving them to your baby. Good choices for first fruits for vegetarian babies include mashed bananas, strained peaches, applesauce, and mashed avocados."
