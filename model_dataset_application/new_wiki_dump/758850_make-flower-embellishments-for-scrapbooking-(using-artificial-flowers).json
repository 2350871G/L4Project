You can keep the stems to use in other projects if wished. Flatten the flowers a little if needed. Decorate or smarten up the flowers.

A floral birthday card Prepare the card. Make the cardstock into card size for the background piece, and ensure that it opens up neatly as a card should. Cut a half piece of differently colored cardstock to stick onto the lower half of the card. Measure this piece to fit across the larger card. Punch out two circles from the background color cardstock. Match the circle size to make it slightly larger than the flower size but not by much. Take the two circles that have been punched out and set aside a flower for each circle. Punch out two circles larger than the ones just punched. These will sit behind the smaller circle. Prepare any other dimension of the scrapping project that will fit alongside the flowers. In this example, the other dimensional is a circle with \"Happy Birthday\" written inside it. Pierce a hole through the middle of the flower and the two circles. Use tweezer tips, a needle, or a similar sharp ended point to create the hole. Push through a petit fastener and push out the flaps on the back of the fastener against the back of the large circle. This fastener will hold the three pieces in place and its circular part creates the raised heart of the flower. Embellish the design. On the outer larger circle, add a circle of dots with a marker. This creates an additional finishing touch to help the flower stand out. Add the 3D items to your project. Arrange the flowers on the card (or scrapping project) as wished. In this example, a birthday card is used. Two flower circles are added to each end, with a Happy Birthday circle placed in the center. Adhere using either small scrapping stickies, tape, or craft glue. Complete your design as wished. The example shows a dotted edging being made using a marker. The project shown here includes the addition of ribbon to finish off the card. The ribbon is tied into a neat bow. Continue making as many flower embellishments as desired. They make good gifts for scrapping friends and are also ideal to sell in small packets online or on craft stalls.",
