Don't worry about whether the shot you just took is exposed and focused properly. If it looked good through the viewfinder, and your camera thought your exposure was about right, move on to the next shot. You've got no LCD to nag you after each shot (although you may find yourself looking at the back of the camera out of habit). Chances are good that you got it right."

Stick your camera in a fully-automatic mode, if you have one. Automate everything you can if you don't. Automation exists for a reason: it lets you concentrate on getting the important parts of your shot right rather than concentrating on technical trivia like exposure that cameras can guess more accurately than you can most of the time. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/6\\/61\\/Dawn_on_Sensia_400_429.jpg\\/460px-Dawn_on_Sensia_400_429.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/6\\/61\\/Dawn_on_Sensia_400_429.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":311,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":513.76,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>dawn, shot on a pentax zx-m, 50mm f\\/2 and sensia 400 slide film.\\n<\\/p><p>use freely but link to <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external free\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/lewiscollard.com\\/\\\">http:\\/\\/lewiscollard.com\\/<\\/a>\\n<\\/p><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/2.5\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Move around all the time. Don't take boring pictures at your normal eye level. If you have to crawl on the ground to make it interesting, do that (it's what washing machines were made for). Always get as low and close to your subject as you can. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/6\\/6e\\/Gate_on_Sensia_400_989.jpg\\/460px-Gate_on_Sensia_400_989.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/6\\/6e\\/Gate_on_Sensia_400_989.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":332,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":547.7185501066098,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>gate. pentax zx-m, 50mm f\\/2 and sensia 400. i did this.\\n<\\/p><p>use freely but link to <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external free\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/lewiscollard.com\\/\\\">http:\\/\\/lewiscollard.com\\/<\\/a>\\n<\\/p><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/2.5\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}  Simplify your shot as much as you can. Think before you shoot. Ask yourself: what can I remove from this shot to simplify it? What am I conveying here? (Think colour, texture, repetition, contrasts, etc.) \"Is this shot just a boring snapshot of nothing that anyone else would take?\" Don't second guess yourself. Don't worry about whether the shot you just took is exposed and focused properly. If it looked good through the viewfinder, and your camera thought your exposure was about right, move on to the next shot. You've got no LCD to nag you after each shot (although you may find yourself looking at the back of the camera out of habit). Chances are good that you got it right. Go home. Unload your film and stick it in the fridge, then kick back and relax. There's nothing else you need to do; that is another of the joys of shooting film. Get your film developed and scanned. Nearly all labs will toast a CD for you with high-quality scans of your pictures for a small additional charge. Do this. There's no reason for you to scan them yourself. Not only does this put additional effort into the process (which is bad); it's also likely that their scans will be much better than what you could do with all but the most expensive of dedicated film scanners. Pick out the best of your photos and put them online. Owing to the extra effort that you put in to making each shot worth the developing cost, you'll likely have many more great photographs than you did shooting digital, so show them off to the world!",
