  "text":" Mix the milk and water together so that it is lukewarm.  Put all the bread ingredients including the milk / water mix into a food processor bowl fitted with a dough blade (or into a mixing bowl if mixing by hand).  Run the food processor for maybe 1 minute until the ingredients have formed into a lump of dough. If mixing by hand, then use hands in mixing bowl to combine  the ingredients into a dough ball. Knead the dough ball for 10 minutes on a clean worktop.  Put kneaded dough in a large bowl and cover with clingfilm.  Punch a little air hole in the clingfilm and put bowl in a warm place for 1 hour.  After the hour is up, the dough should have enlarged. Remove it from the bowl and beat it back into its original size on the worktop. Put the sultanas in a jug and cover them with hot water either from a tap or kettle and leave for 5 minutes.  Pour sultanas / water into a sieve and try to remove any residual water.  Put sultanas and walnut pieces on worktop with the dough and kneed them all together so the walnuts and sultanas are evenly dispersed in the dough.  Divide dough into three equally sized balls by cutting it with a knife.  Flour the worktop and use a rolling pin to roll the first dough ball into a rectangle (or thereabouts) about the size of a sheet of A4 paper.  Sprinkle the dough with poppy and sesame seeds evenly over the whole area.  Carefully roll the sheet of dough (rolling from the longer side) so that it is fully rolled up like a Swiss roll.  Transfer the roll to a baking tray with the outer dough edge at the bottom of the roll so it cannot unroll.  Repeat with the other two dough balls so you end up with three rolls on the baking tray (hereafter referred to as loaves).  Using scissors, snip the top of each loaf at an angle at regular intervals up the entire length of the roll.  Using pastry brush, brush water onto the outer surface of all three loaves.  Sprinkle poppy and sesame seeds onto the loaves so they stick to the water.  Using a sieve, dust the loaves with white flour.  Put the tray of loaves in a warm place (about 50 degrees C) for 45 minutes to an hour. They should rise. Heat an oven to 175 \u00b0C (347 \u00b0F).  Put tray of loaves in middle of oven and bake for about 12 minutes (or until they are slightly browned).  Remove tray from oven and allow to cool for a few minutes before transferring loaves to a wire rack where they should remain until cool. ",
