          "description":"There are a number of different styles of wedding photography, and different photographers will specialise in different styles. Take some time to read up on and learn about the different styles and think about which one suits you best. Some of the main wedding photography styles are as follows:\nTraditional, or classic: here a photographer will work from a \u2018shot list\u2019 to make sure that they capture all the traditional pictures, and those the couple have specifically requested. Photojournalism: this is more of a documentary-style, where the photographers will follow you and take fewer \u2018posed\u2019 pictures, instead trying to tell the story of your wedding in a normal naturalistic style. Illustrative photography: this style is a combination of the first two. It includes posed pictures, but there is more emphasis put on relaxed and informal poses, albeit still with careful composition. Fashion: this style tends to be more dramatic than the others, and will make the subjects appear more glamorous and styled."

          "description":"Booking your wedding photographer should be one of the first things you do after you have booked your venue. Wedding photographers are in high demand, especially in the busiest times of year for weddings, and many of the best ones will be booked up a year in advance. If you are having an out-of-season wedding, or getting married on a Sunday, a top photographer will be easier to find at relatively short notice. For weddings at the most popular times, look at least a year in advance. For weddings at less popular times, six months might be enough."

          "headline":"Ask for personal recommendations.",
          "description":"The best wedding photographers will tend to develop a reputation, and may be known locally to your friends are family. Start your search by asking people you know and trust if they have any recommendations, either through personal experience, or word of mouth. Talk to people you know who have got married in the last few years and ask about their experience. If a friend recommends the photographer she used for her wedding, ask to look the album of photos. Bear in mind that people have different tastes and ideas for what makes good wedding photography. You can also ask any other professionals you are hiring to work on your wedding. A wedding planner will have excellent contacts."

          "headline":"Avoid hiring family or friends.",
          "description":"It may be tempting to hire somebody you know to be your wedding photographer. You may be drawn towards hiring someone you trust, who knows you and your partner well, and you think will understand what kind of pictures you want. While this might turn out perfectly well, it is highly likely that this person will not have the technical skills and experience to give you the best photos. Consider if this person has the technical knowledge of light and photography to anticipate and quickly correct any problems that may occur. Ask yourself if she has a spare camera of high quality. Does she have experience working with large groups of people? Would she be able and happy to spend all day, maybe 8-12 hours, behind the camera and not participating in the wedding as a guest?"

          "headline":"Search online.",
          "description":"A great way to search for wedding photographers is to look online. There will be a very large number of people advertising their services, so think about how you can focus your search more closely and narrow down the results. Look for people with plenty of experience and lots of information about themselves and the photography they produce. You should also look to see if they work with an assistant or solo. You can search for people in a specific location, like your city. Look for photographers according to their particular style. Think about your budget and pay attention to the rates quoted by the various photographers you find online."

Try to find reviews of the people you are interested in by searching for their names. You should be cautious with reviews and be prepared to make up your own mind, but the more information you have the better. Be cautious of being influenced too heavily by images on the website of a photographer. Although this is a great way to get a feel of the photographer\u2019s work, there have been instances where people have stolen or bought photos taken by somebody else, and presented them as their own. Try to research the candidates fully to avoid any potential scams or tricks."

Then you can arrange to meet, interview, and inspect the portfolios of your chosen few. Think carefully about who you want to interview, and consider what elements are most important to you. It can be hard to judge somebody from a website, but you should be trying to get a picture of their personality, as well as their technical skills and personal style. Think about whether you want contemporary, documentary, or perhaps fashion-style photographs. Consider including somebody on your shortlist who is a little over your budget. It could be useful exercise to evaluate what each photographer provides for the money charged."

Ask the photographer to describe the style they shoot in, and be sure to ask any further questions if anything is unclear to you.

You should ask how many weddings the photographer has shot, and how many similar to yours. Different weddings have can hugely different requirements and expectations, so it\u2019s important that you understand how much experience they have that is especially relevant to you. Find out if they are a specialist wedding photographer, or if they photograph various different events.

Having an assistant, especially if the wedding has more than around 50 people, is likely to be an important addition. It won\u2019t be possible for one person to capture everything.

Colour correction is a basic part of post-production, and can make a big difference. Be sure you are completely clear on the photographer\u2019s practices.

If they are going to very hands-on and active, you should make sure that this won\u2019t be a distraction or annoyance.
