To know how much approval rating you currently have, journey to the Town Hall (the purple marker on the map at the bottom screen). Enter the Town Hall and sit in the mayor\u2019s chair located behind Isabelle\u2019s desk. Isabelle will approach you once you sit down, and speak to you, giving you a variety of options. Select \u201cCheck approval rating\u201d to see how the villagers view you. If it is not yet 100%, there are several things you can do to quickly reach the perfect goal. If it is perfect, proceed to Part 2."

Changing the town flag\u2014Speak to Isabelle in the Town Hall. Putting something up for sale at Re-tail\u2014Visiting Re-tail (the pink arrow icon on the map at the bottom of the screen), and talk to Reese, the pink alpaca. Posting something on the bulletin board\u2014Go to the bulletin board next to the train station (northernmost part of town) and hit \u201cA\u201d on your console, and then enter your message. Donating a fish, bug, or fossil to the museum\u2014This can be done after capturing a fish with the fishing rod, catching a bug with the net, or digging up a fossil with the shovel. Enter the museum, which is on the far left side of Main Street, and talk to Blathers."

Sending letters\u2014Buy letter paper at the Nookling Junction.

Depending on what your villagers want, there will be a variety of different options, with up to 13 available at a time:\nPermanent Buildings\u2014These are independent businesses, and offer a variety of services to the player, ranging from dance clubs to a police station. Each one has very different  extra features that can enhance the game. These are the caf\u00e9, campsite, Club LOL, Dream Suite, Fortune Teller Shop, Museum Renovation, police station, and Reset Surveillance Center. Remodeling Projects\u2014Remodeling projects do not serve a utilitarian function; they are merely a way to change your town\u2019s aesthetics. If you want to impress visitors to your town, or want a change of scenery, Remodeling Projects are a good investment. These are the Zen Town Hall, Fairy-Tale Town Hall, Modern Town Hall, Fairy-Tale Train Station, Zen Train Station, and Modern Train Station. Utility Structures\u2014Utility Structures are interactive objects placed throughout towns. Players and villagers can sit on the furniture, or ring the bells. These can make your town like a large playground. Utility Structures are Camping Cot, Outdoor Chair, Hammock, Bell, Zen Bell, Benches, Picnic Blanket, Tire Toy, Pile of Pipes, Chair Sculpture, Bridges (only 3 bridges can be constructed in one town), Bus Stop, Clocks, Drinking Fountain, Fence, Fire Hydrant, Fountain, Garbage Can, Instrument Shelter, Signs, Street Lamps, Traffic Signal, and Water Well. Public Art\u2014Public Art is not interactive; its function is to make your town more beautiful. Like the remodeling projects, they make your town more visually impressive and provide a nice change in atmosphere. You can select among 3 different types of arches, Archway Sculpture, Cube Sculpture, Custom Design-Sign, Face Cut-Out Standee, Fire Pit, Flower Bed, Hot Spring, Illuminated Heart, Illuminated Tree, Jungle Gym, Rack of Rice, Sandbox, Scarecrow, Stadium Light, Statue Fountain, three different kinds of Topiaries, Torch, Video Screen, Water Pump, Wisteria Trellis, and Zen Garden. Landmarks\u2014Landmarks are like Public Art, but a bit pricier to fund. They often are small scale models of famous landmarks, giving your town an extravagant feel. These include Drilling Rig, Geyser, Lighthouse, Moai Statue, Parabolic Antenna, Pyramid, Solar Panels, Sphinx, Stone Tablet, Stonehenge, Totem Pole, Tower, Windmill, and Wind Turbine."
