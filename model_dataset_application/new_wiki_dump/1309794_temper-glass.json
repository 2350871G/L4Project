You will weaken or break the glass if you attempt to cut or reshape it in any way after tempering.Warning: Always wear safety glasses and a face mask that covers your mouth and nose when you are cutting and shaping glass to prevent you from breathing any glass dust in. Tempered glass is much harder than regular glass. However, if you cut, drill, or otherwise modify it after tempering, then it is highly likely that it will shatter into small pieces because it is more brittle than regular glass. Even if it doesn\u2019t break, the glass will be compromised and will not be as strong as intended."

Such imperfections can make the glass break during tempering, so do not try to temper glass with any cracks or bubbles. It\u2019s important to do this after cutting the glass, in case any cracks or other damages were caused while cutting the glass."

Wet the sandpaper to keep glass dust from flying up in the air, and sand along the edges until the sharp edges are gone so that they aren\u2019t dangerous. You can sand the edges by hand, with an electric sander, or with a rotary tool like a Dremel tool."

The industry standard for tempering glass is 620 \u00b0C (1,148 \u00b0F).

Heat it for a full 25 minutes at above 600 \u00b0F (316 \u00b0C) to be sure you temper it. In a glass tempering facility, you will be able to be more precise with the times because of the special ovens they have. However, if you are tempering glass in less-scientific conditions, then you will have to experiment to learn exactly how long it takes to temper different thicknesses of glass in your oven or kiln."

          "description":"Immediately start blasting the glass with cool air from high-pressure nozzles at various angles after you remove it from the oven. This causes the outer surfaces of the glass to contract and compress against the center by cooling them faster, which is what makes the tempered glass strong.Tip: Tempered glass has to have a surface compression of 10,000 PSI or higher. It will typically break under about 24,000 PSI. If you are tempering glass in a special facility with a quenching oven, the oven will have nozzles to blast cool air preset at different angles. If you are working with more limited resources, you can use a compressed air hose and move it constantly while blasting the glass to hit all the different angles. Tempered glass is about 6 times stronger than regular glass. When it does break, it will break into small shards that are much safer than the jagged pieces that regular glass (called floating glass) breaks into."
