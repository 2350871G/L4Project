Even after the declaration, the state still has to complete preliminary disaster assessments and stabilize the situation on the ground to the point that application locations can be supported. For example, if your entire area is without power, D-SNAP would not be activated until power was at least partially restored. The state must also request and receive federal approval to activate D-SNAP."

In addition, you must be able to show that at least one of the following things happened to you because of the disaster:\nYour home or business was damaged;\nYou lost income (or will lose income);\nYou have disaster-related expenses, such as home repairs;\nYour bank is closed due to the disaster; or\nYour food is damaged or spoiled due to the disaster itself or to power outages."

          "description":"Government workers look at the total take-home income you expect to receive in the month of the disaster and add money in bank accounts that you can use during that time. Then they'll subtract any money you've already spent on disaster-related expenses, such as temporary shelter. The final amount is compared to a threshold figure, which varies depending on the number of people in your household. For example, if you are married with 2 children, there are 4 people in your household. According to the 2018 income eligibility standards, you can get benefits as long as your household income (after the subtraction of disaster-related expenses) is $2,755. The maximum benefits available for a 4-person household are $640, as of 2018. Your liquid assets are also included when determining your financial eligibility. This would typically include money in a bank account that you can easily access. Because of the impact of natural disasters, D-SNAP benefits use different financial criteria than regular SNAP benefits. Even if you don't qualify for SNAP, you may qualify for D-SNAP depending on your situation."

Answer all the questions as completely and honestly as you can. Gather receipts to provide exact amounts when listing your disaster-related expenses on the application. Avoid making general estimates. Any incorrect or inaccurate information on your application could result in a denial of benefits.

Your EBT card may have a pre-assigned PIN or you may have to create one yourself. Once activated, your EBT card can be used to purchase food at any local grocery or convenience stores that are open for business. Benefits typically show up on the card within 48 hours after the card is issued.Tip: Before D-SNAP benefits are made available, state officials must determine that there are enough local food retailers to meet the needs of D-SNAP clients."
