Check with your local city, village or town hall about the rules in your area. Generally speaking, padded envelopes that are entirely constructed of paper are usually recyclable. The envelopes that contain material that looks like dryer lint are recyclable in many communities. However, paper envelopes that contain mixed materials, such as paper and plastic (like bubble wrap) may not be recyclable unless you are able to separate the plastic from the paper, and discard them separately (the paper in your bin and the plastic at a special recycling center in your community). In Seattle, for example, padded envelopes are generally non-recyclable. Check with your local government about regulations, especially if you have padded envelopes with bubble wrap inside."

Some manufacturers' websites offer suggestions for recycling of padded envelopes, and some manufacturers have well developed recycling programs. Some communities will not accept certain padded envelopes, such as those heavily coated with plastic film, for recycling at all. They also do not recommend that you compost them. Some manufacturers have set up custom programs that work with local recyclers in your region instead. For example, Tyvek industrial packaging contains high-density polyethylene. However, the manufacturer has set up a network of recyclers to take back the items. Contact the manufacturer directly. Sometimes plastic coating on envelopes can be mechanically recycled into other products, such as cable protection piping, automotive parts, and blown film."

It\u2019s possible the post office will take your padded envelope. The post office buys and uses some recycled materials and also provides recyclable mailers for purchase at some locations. Many packaging stores (like UPS) may also accept padded envelopes. Check with the local office to find out for sure.

          "description":"Instead of throwing away the padded envelope, just use it again! You could easily cross off the address, and send the envelope out again, rather than prematurely tossing it into a garbage can. If you don\u2019t want the old address to be visible, cross it off, and then cover it with a shipping label or piece of adhesive paper on which you write the new address. That way you won\u2019t have to throw it away. Use tape to reseal the envelope. If you have no reason to reuse the padded envelope immediately, store it in a drawer where you keep things like gift bags that you intend to reuse. There will likely come a time when you need to use it. The good thing about padded envelopes is that you can save them literally for years. It will save you money to reuse the padded envelope, anyway, as they are more expensive than normal envelopes."

Especially if you have padded envelopes in bulk, rather than trying to throw them away, offer them for free to anyone who needs them. Non-profits, small businesses, or community organizations, especially, might have a use for them. You could also offer them up for free to other friends or family via your own social media sites. Neighbors might also have some use for them. It\u2019s almost always better to repurpose items than to risk clogging landfills with them. Padded envelopes are pretty durable and can usually withstand several uses. Try selling them on online auction sites if you have a lot of them. Give the envelopes to a local business that you want to support. The envelopes actually cost a lot of money if you use a lot of them, so this could help someone out."

You will prevent your knees from getting dirty or scuffed if you kneel on the envelopes while working. Other people use the padded envelopes for storage. Common items stored in padded envelopes include jewelry or Christmas ornaments. Use bubble wrap to protect outside plants from bad weather conditions. Bring them to sporting events or anywhere that a child might end up sitting on a hard chair. Use the padded envelope as a makeshift chair pad to prevent sore butts."
