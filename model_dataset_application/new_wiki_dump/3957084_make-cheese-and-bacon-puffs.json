  "text":" Wash your hands, tie back long hair, wipe down any surfaces that you will use making the puffs and gather the ingredients and equipment.  Grate the cheese into medium sized gratings.  Put the frying pan on the hob and switch the hob onto the highest setting. Leave the pan for 2 - 4 minutes to heat. Add the chopped bacon to the pan and cook until the bacon is a darker pink, the fat has shrunk and it is clearly cooked, stirring occasionally with the wooden spoon to prevent the bacon from burning.  Turn the hob down to a mid-to-low setting, and add a third of the cheese, stirring with the bacon immediately to prevent burning or sticking to the pan.

Pour the cheese and bacon into the small bowl, and leave for 1 minute to cool down somewhat. During this time, turn off the hob and soak the frying pan to prevent any food from sticking to it or staining it. Add the beaten egg to the cheese and bacon while it is still warm and stir thoroughly so the egg is combined.

Using the pallet knife, stir in a tablespoon of water at a time until the mixture comes easily as a slightly sticky dough. It should be pale and easily workable. Lightly flour a large, flat surface with the flour dredger, with the rolling pin. Do not over-flour as this can change the fat:flour ratio of the pastry. Place the dough ball onto the flour and roll out until it is a large rectangle of about half a centimetre thick. Be careful to continuously turn the pastry or it may stick to the surface, and ensure you re-flour the surface when necessary. Across two-thirds of the pastry, place about a third of the butter and a third of the remaining lard or white fat evenly across it, before folding up the bottom half of the pastry over the other pastry and folding down the upper part of the pastry.
