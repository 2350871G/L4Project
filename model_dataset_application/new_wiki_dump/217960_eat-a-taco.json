Overfilling a soft taco will make it harder to wrap and might cause it to tear and lose its filling. Be prepared in the event that filling does fall out or your hard shell breaks.

Pico de Gallo - This chopped and raw salsa usually consists of onions, tomatoes, and chili peppers. Salsa Verde - Again, you can make this green salsa as spicy or mild as you like.
