A or B \u2014 Press once to jump, or press and hold to jump higher. If you're crouched, this button will cause you to backflip. X or Y \u2014 Press once to throw Cappy, or hold to make Cappy stay after being thrown. Hold down to sprint when possible.

Triple Jump \u2014 Press A or B three times at the height of each jump. Allows Mario to jump up to three times in succession. Roll \u2014 Hold ZL to crouch, then press Y. Hold down Y to keep rolling. Useful for things like avoiding some traps. Ground Pound \u2014 Press B, then press ZL. Causes Mario to slam into the ground. Ground Pound Jump \u2014 Press B immediately after executing a Ground Pound. Causes Mario to jump higher than usual. Dive \u2014 Press ZL + Y while in the middle of a fall. Causes Mario to dive rather than just landing. Backflip \u2014 Hold ZL while pressing B. Mario will flip backward. Swim \u2014 When in water, press ZL, then press Y.
