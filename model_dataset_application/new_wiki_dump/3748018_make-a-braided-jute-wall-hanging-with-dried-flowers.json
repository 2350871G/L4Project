  "text":" Making the Jute Lengths Choose three jute rope rolls. One must be dark in color and the other two jute rolls two shades lighter. Take the first lightly colored jute rope. Tie it firmly to the handle, hook or chair back that you've chosen to work from. Take the rope from the first handle to second one. Then take it back to the first handle. Repeat this procedure until you have 25 to 30 rope lengths. Repeat the procedure for the darker colored jute rope. Start by making a knot between end of lightly colored rope and the darker colored rope. Keep the other lightly colored rope aside for now. Repeat the procedure for the third lightly colored rope. Make a knot off the second (darker) colored rope, forming equal lines, as you have made in first one 25 to 30 rope lengths. Gather all the jute lengths. Hold them in your hand. Take scissors. Cut the rope at one end. Take off the hanging lengths. Arrange and centralize the alignment of the jute lengths. Cut the jute lengths so that all lengths are equal. Making a Hanger Loop Hold the jute lengths at the center. Curve one end into a loop. This will serve as a hanger. Keep in place by wrapping one jute length around all the jute lengths to form a tight holding knot. Strengthen the hanger loop by wrapping. Use a single colored length to wrap around the lop. Twist it all around the hanger loop tightly. Vary the colors used if wished, as shown in the image. Once it has been completely wrapped, finish off by knotting the loop length firmly, to prevent it from unraveling. Hang the hanger loop to a nail or a place where it is able to remain firmly in place as you continue to work on braiding the hanging.  Braiding the Hanger Divide the rope into three equal portions in readiness for braiding. Ensure that a good mixture of colored ropes is found within each of the three divisions you're making. If wished, tie the ends of each portion loosely, to keep the portions together during braiding (see image). Braid each of the three divided portions individually. Knot the end of each completed braid piece using a single jute length. Tie firmly and tightly to prevent the braids from unraveling. Loosely stitch the three braids together from the back side. This ensures that they will remain in the right place, aligned neatly alongside each other. Making the Flowers Using a cutter, cut the jute wire into equal lengths. Aim to make the same size of wire to ensure that each of the petals is even. Shape the wire into a teardrop, a standard petal shape. Wind the excess wire at the ends together, to prevent unraveling. Repeat to make five to six petals per flower. Thus, if you want more than one flower, make enough petals to form each flower. It's recommended that you make six flowers for this wall hanging. The finished wire products: Wind colored jute rope around the jute wire (except for the stems). This will cover the wire and forms the pretty colors for the flowers (select colors of your preference). Use glue to help keep the wound-on rope in place, and tie off firmly at the end, plus add some glue for additional strength. Then, glue onto the jute fabric as background and allow to dry fully. Once dried, cut out the petal shapes, keeping the jute fabric in the center as part of the whole petal. Shape the jute wire into flower petals. Do this by turning each petal slightly downwards. See image for the result. Use the golden stems to form a flower. Tie five to six stems together, twisting to hold, thereby forming a flower. Wrap thread tightly around all of the stems of the four or five petals. This neatens the look, prevents the wire from snagging and finishes the flower. Shape the flower again and it is ready for use on the wall hanging. Repeat for the other flowers. Make at least five to six flowers. Finding or Making the Dried Plants Collect or buy some dried plants of different species. These can be purchased from florists or craft stores or you can find items in your own garden, such as gumnuts, flowers that have dried naturally or flowers you have dried. Spray the flowers a golden color. This is optional but makes for a nice touch to the final appearance of the hanging. Let the sprayed flowers and dried plant life dry.  Forming the Final Arrangement Arrange the flowers, mirror tile pieces (if using) and dried plants in any sequence you like. Try out different arrangements and choose the one you like best. Attach and/or glue on all the flowers, mirror tile pieces and dried plants on the braided section of the hanging. A glue gun makes this easier to do. Done. Your jute wall hanging decoration piece is ready to display.",
