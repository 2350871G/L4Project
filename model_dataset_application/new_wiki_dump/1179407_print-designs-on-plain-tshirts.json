If not, you'll find what you need at a craft or art store. Round up the following materials:\nA t-shirt. A plain, basic cotton t-shirt is fine. Know that some paints and inks will bleed through thin cotton, so if this is a concern for you, you might want to choose a thicker blend. The color you choose should be light enough (or dark enough) that the paint colors will show up well. A stencil. You can buy a pre-made stencil from a craft store or  make your own using cardboard. Paint or ink. Acrylic fabric paint is a good choice for printing on t-shirts. You could also go with a fabric ink or stain. Look for a type that won't come out in the washing machine. A small paint roller and paint tray. You'll need this to apply the paint to the t-shirt evenly. If you don't have a roller, you can use a wide paintbrush. Tape. This is to hold the stencil in place while you apply the paint. Masking tape works well for this purpose."

Place the stencil on the part of the t-shirt where you want to print the design. Tape the edges of the stencil to the t-shirt to hold it in place. If you're worried the paint is going to bleed, place a piece of cardboard inside the t-shirt; this will prevent the paint from seeping through the shirt to the other side. To prevent paint splatters from getting on your nice clothes, you might want to put on an old t-shirt before you start painting."
