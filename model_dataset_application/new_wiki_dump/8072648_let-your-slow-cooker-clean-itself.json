  "text":" Prepping Your Slow Cooker Rinse your slow cooker. Before you set your slow cooker up for self-cleaning, you must take a few steps to prepare. First, you must rinse any food residue out of your slow cooker with warm water. If there are any large chunks of food attached to your slow cooker, scrape them away as you rinse. Gather ingredients. Now it is time for you to gather your self-cleaning ingredients. You are going to need white vinegar, baking soda, and a \u00bd cup (120 ml) measuring cup. Fill your slow cooker with water. Finally, prepare your slow cooker by filling it with warm water. If there is a line of food residue, be sure to fill your slow cooker above this line. Adding Cleaning Agents Add vinegar. Now that you\u2019ve done a bit of prep work, it is time to let your slow cooker clean itself. Begin this process by adding 1 cup (240 ml) of distilled white vinegar for a 6 quart slow cooker (or \u00bd cup [120 ml] for a 3 quart) to the warm water in your slow cooker. Slowly add baking soda. Next, add your baking soda. It is important to add this very slowly! Add a little bit at a time, let the bubbles die down, and then add a bit more. You will add a total of 1 cup (240 ml) for a 6 quart slow cooker (or \u00bd cup for a 3 quart). In other words, you will add equal parts vinegar and baking soda. Vinegar and baking soda are naturally abrasive, so these products make excellent cleansers. Turn the slow cooker on low. Now, close the lid, plug in your slow cooker, and set it to its lowest setting. (If your slow cooker has only one setting, that is fine.) Avoid using the \"high\" setting, as this can cause the vinegar and baking soda to bubble over. Leave for several hours. Leave your slow cooker to self-clean for at least three (or up to eight) hours. If your slow cooker has lots of built up grime, it is a good idea to leave it overnight. Finishing Up Turn off and allow to cool. After a few hours (or as long as overnight), turn off and unplug your slow cooker. Be careful, as it will be very hot. Allow your slow cooker to cool down for 30-45 minutes. Empty liquid into the sink. Once your slow cooker has cooled, carefully empty the liquid into the sink. Now rinse your slow cooker with warm water once again. Wash with soapy water. After this self-cleaning process, any gunk and food residue should easily wipe clean.
