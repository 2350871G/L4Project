Every booster pack is guaranteed 1 rare card, but may also include more. This includes particularly rare cards, such as holofoil, and \u201cstar\u201d rare.

This can be a great way of achieving a particular rare (along with a few random ones), assuming it\u2019s a rare that you want. New Pok\u00e9mon tins are regularly released as new sets of cards come out. Older tins are not always kept in stock however, so make sure you take advantage of tin releases."

Buying a box is the most efficient way of obtaining a large amount of cards, and many retailers will offer a small discount for purchasing a box. Note that you will at least receive 36 rare cards by purchasing a box, and usually more than that. However, like buying individual packs, there is no guarantee of receiving a specific card that you desire."
