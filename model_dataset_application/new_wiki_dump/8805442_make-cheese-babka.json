Shaping the Babka Grease a bundt pan. To bake the babka, you\u2019ll need a bundt pan. Lightly grease the interior of the pan with butter to ensure that the babka won\u2019t stick after baking. You can use nonstick cooking spray to grease the bundt pan if you prefer. You can also use loaf pans for the babka; you may need to cut the dough in half and place it in two separate pans, though.

Let it rise until it nearly doubles in size again, which should take approximately 1 hour. It helps to place the dough in a warm spot when you\u2019re waiting for it to rise. Baking the Babka Preheat the oven. To ensure that the oven is hot enough to bake the babka, you must preheat it. When the babka is nearly finished rising, set the temperature to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C), and allow it to fully preheat. Bake the babka until it is golden brown.
