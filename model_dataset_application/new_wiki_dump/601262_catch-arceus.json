The last Arceus event was in 2010 and there are no more planned, meaning the only way to get one in Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum without cheating is to trade with someone who got one from the event. Arceus is an incredibly rare Pok\u00e9mon, so you'll likely only be able to trade for one if you have an equally rare Pok\u00e9mon to offer in return. Event Legendaries such as Landorus and Deoxys are good choices. If you have a Shiny Legendary such as a Shiny Mew or Shiny Rayquaza, this will also be good for trading."

The steps for transferring Pok\u00e9mon will vary depending on which versions you are transferring to/from. Since Arceus is not available in earlier versions, you will at least be transferring from Generation 4. You can trade an Arceus from Diamond, Platinum, Pearl, HeartGold, or SoulSilver using PokeTransfer, as well as from any of the Black or White games as a regular trade. In order to get an Arceus from an older version of the Pok\u00e9mon to X or Y, it will need to first be transferred to Black, White, Black 2, or White 2. You can then use PokeTransporter and PokeBank to transfer Arceus into X or Y."
