          "headline":"Provide comfortable seating.",
          "description":"Individual chairs can be situated close together to promote an intimate atmosphere. A couple cushioned benches may be more practical in terms of space for sunrooms that see a lot of traffic. If you lean more towards leisure, you might include a plush chaise lounge or cottage-style daybed in addition to your more casual pieces. Make sure there's enough seating to accommodate half a dozen or so people if you plan on doing any entertaining."

        {
          "headline":"Center your furniture around a utilitarian table.",
          "description":"Find the right table is important, as it will be the hub around which most of the activities in the sunroom will take place. Look for low, flat-topped pieces that can hold a cup of coffee or tray of hors d'oeuvres as easily as a pile of playing cards. Pick out a table that's roughly the same height as your seating. That way, you won't be forced to reach once you've sat down and gotten nestled in."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Prioritize comfort with soft accessories.",
          "description":"Replacing ordinary furnishings with a plush sofa or some easy chairs will make for a cozier place to sit and unwind. Heap your new seating arrangements with pillows and hand-knit throw blankets for more of a down home touch, or offset the idyllic conditions outside with minimalistic, contemporary (but no less snuggly) touches. Feel free to get creative with your setup\u2014for instance, you could hang a hammock in one corner or arrange cushions on the floor for a seating area with a distinctly east-Asian flavor."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Draw inspiration from garden accessories for a rustic feel.",
          "description":"If you have a green thumb, invite the outdoors in with repurposed items like  box planters and fanciful ornaments. A raw stone tabletop could mimic the appearance of stepping stones, while a trickling fountain captivates as the focal point of your new setup. With the doors open, your sunroom will feel more like a greenhouse. You could even use rustic objects like wheelbarrows or wooden crates and barrels as alternatives to more traditional pieces."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Try out new window covers.",
          "description":"The windows are one of the most important parts of the sunroom, so they deserve some attention of their own. Sliding drapes or a retractable mesh screen will shield out the harsh late afternoon sunlight, and can be drawn at daybreak when you want to gaze out on the sunrise. Conversely, if you\u2019ve been using the same tired curtains for years, you might trade them in for a set of sleek adjustable window slats. This is one of the cheapest alterations you can make to your patio enclosure\u2014you can often install new window covers on the same mountings."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Introduce attractive lighting solutions.",
          "description":"It won't be sunny 'round the clock, which means you'll need some form of secondary lighting to illuminate your sunroom as daylight dims. A few basic tabletop lamps will work just fine for this purpose. You can also give yourself more control over the brightness of the room at any given time with an overhead light fixture or series of sconces connected to a dimmer switch. Compare light fixtures in various styles to find one that suits the character of your redesigned sunroom. Candles, tea lights, or stringer bulbs will give off just enough of a glow when you want to keep the electric light soft."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Pick out furniture made from durable materials.",
          "description":"After a while, exposure to the sun's rays can damage delicate fabrics, causing bleaching, drying, or shrinking. Hard-wearing synthetic upholstery like nylon and polyester will help prevent deterioration. As a bonus, synthetics tends to be water-resistant, making them impervious to spills and mildew from too many misty mornings. Patio and outdoor furniture is a safe bet, since they're designed to survive a wide range of weather conditions. Natural fabrics like cotton, which is bad about fading, and leather, which is prone to drying and cracking, are probably best left in the living room."

          "headline":"Keep your furnishings light.",
          "description":"However you decide to decorate your sunroom, don\u2019t overdo it. By nature, sunrooms are intended to be bright, open, airy spaces. Reserve most of the room for essential items like tables and chairs, and leave enough room between each to allow you and your guests to breathe. An overly-busy sunroom can feel stuffy and chaotic, which is exactly the opposite of what you\u2019re going for. Limit the number of accessories around the windows and let the view itself serve as the main attraction."

Don't be afraid to mix things up by sticking bold bursts of primary color like reds, blues, and yellows with toned-down neutral shades. Ideally, both the main pieces and secondary accessories like pillows and throw rugs should have their own distinct qualities that achieve perfect harmony when viewed together. Start with a particular theme (such as earth tones or cool colors) for the bulk of your decor, then sprinkle in opposing shades to the accompanying accents more visually appealing. Avoid using too many shades that are similar but not identical. Colors that almost match can be disruptive to the eye."

          "description":"Do away with drab plastic, metal, and painted furniture and bring in pieces with rich wood or stone finishes. Wicker, rattan, and teak are all popular staples of sunroom style, though waterproof woods like pine and cedar are also resilient enough to last in a covered enclosure. Using more natural materials enables you to create a seamless transition with the outside world. Stain or distress wood pieces to better suit the unique style of your interior. Clinking shell wind chimes or a Japanese bamboo water dropper can make your sunroom a delight to the ear as well as the eye."

Since they have a tendency to be rather loud, it\u2019s best to implement them strategically. Let your decor do most of the work, and jazz things up wherever the energy in the room sags. Even an adjustment as small as changing out the cushions on a loveseat with something more eye-catching can breathe new life into a stagnant sunroom."

        {
          "headline":"Add some elegant greenery.",
          "description":"Use floral arrangements or large potted plants to infuse your sunroom with earth tones. A few sprays of wildflowers, peace lily, or ivy, along with heartier species like ferns and succulents, can keep your lounge area from becoming too sterile and make it feel more like a treehouse or outdoor garden area. Incorporating plants and other botanical elements is a good way for nature lovers to enjoy a taste of the outdoors during rainy days and the cold winter months. Because of the ample light and climate-controlled conditions in your sunroom, there\u2019s arguably no better place in the house to take care of growing plants."

          "description":"Line the areas around the windows with striking contemporary artwork, ornamental wall hangings, or photos containing your most cherished memories. Alternatively, you could go with something less conventional like rustic sheet metal signs or a chic tapestry. Covering up bare walls will give your guests something to admire above ground level. The sunroom can be an ideal place to show off your prized family portraits. Mounted shelves can provide a perch for oddly-shaped items while also serving as a sensible storage solution."
