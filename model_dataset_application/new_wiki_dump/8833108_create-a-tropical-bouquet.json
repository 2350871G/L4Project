You can use any type of fabric that matches your theme or bouquet: ribbon, burlap, cotton, or even strings of gems or pearls. Arranging a Loose Bouquet Start with a base of greenery. Starting with tropical grasses or leaves gives you a base for the rest of your flowers. Big tropical leaves like ginger foliage or virions are a great option for this. Keep in mind that your bouquet will need to match the size of your greenery, so if you\u2019re aiming for a small bouquet, use less greenery, or smaller leaves.

You can use smaller flowers up front and near the bottom of the bouquet \u2013 this allows them to be seen and also doesn\u2019t overwhelm the bouquet in any one spot. Tie with fabric.
