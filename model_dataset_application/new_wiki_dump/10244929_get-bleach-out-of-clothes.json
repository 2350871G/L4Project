In a large bucket or basin, add the garment to \u00bc cup of lemon juice and 1 gallon of boiling water, allow the garment to soak for 1-2 hours then ring the garment out as much as you can. Let the garment dry fully in the sun before wearing it again."

Buy white vinegar from your local store and completely saturate the stain in vinegar. Rinse the garment in cold water once done and then repeat if necessary. Prior to treating the garment with vinegar, rinse the garment in cold water to remove any of the residual bleach. Mixing bleach with vinegar can release toxins. Use limited quantities when using vinegar on cotton garments, as in time, vinegar will ruin cotton fabrics."

Once the garment is saturated, rinse in cold water and repeat the process until you are satisfied with the results.

Rinse the garment and then allow it to soak for half an hour in a bucket or basin of cold water and hydrogen peroxide. Add 50 grams of hydrogen peroxide to every 4-5 liters of water.
