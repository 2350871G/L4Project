If possible, plant the Arborvitae tree in late fall or early spring, depending on your preferences. Because of their height, Arborvitae plants do not make good indoor plants and must be grown outside."

Find a spot in your garden that receives at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight to help your tree adapt faster. Though adaptable, arborvitae trees prefer sunny, humid climates. If you live in a climate that does not receive at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight, your tree may grow but will have stunted growth. If your area has hot summers, your tree will need light shade in the afternoon in order to thrive."

Add compost or an organic soil mix to the ground to give your tree a boost as it acclimates to its new spot. To test your soil's draining levels, dig a  12 in (30 cm) deep hole and fill it with water. If the water takes 5-15 minutes to drain, you've found well-draining soil. Arborvitae trees also grow best in alkaline, or non-acidic, soils. You can check your soil's acidity by ordering a soil pH balance test online or from a plant nursery."

Choose a low-lying spot next to an obstruction like a wall, building, or large tree to prevent wind damage. You can also stake your tree to the ground after planting it if you can't find a low-lying spot."

First, dig down far enough to fully cover the root ball, then make the hole 2-3 times as wide as your root ball so that the soil will be loose enough for the roots to grow. If your root ball has a 12 in (30 cm) diameter, for example, dig a 12 in (30 cm) deep hole. Mix compost into your soil before filling in the hole so that the root bulb will receive more nutrients.

Otherwise, the tree may permanently lean. Burying the trunk can cause your tree to develop fungal infections and other diseases."
