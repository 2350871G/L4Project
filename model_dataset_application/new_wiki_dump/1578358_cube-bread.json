  "text":" Cubing a Small Amount With a Knife Grab a bread knife. The serrated edges of a bread knife will have an easier time slicing through the bread. If you do not have a bread knife, use a steak knife or other tool with a serrated edge. Although you can use a straight edge in a pinch, straight edges have a habit of tearing into bread, instead of cutting. Stack your bread two slices high. Place one slice of bread on top of the other. Doing two pieces at a time will cut down on time without sacrificing the appearance of the cubes. This is best done with fresh bread, as stale bread may break or flake too easily. Cut your slices into four strips lengthwise. Placing your knife about one half-inch in (1.27 cm) from the edge of the crust, begin cutting your bread into four strips lengthwise. Place the knife one half-inch from each edge to keep a clean, uniform shape. Turn your bread horizontally. Once you have your four strips, turn your bread to a horizontal position. Straighten any strips that have gone askew--again, cutting as cleanly as possible to maintain a consistent shape. Cut into four more strips. Once more placing your knife one half-inch in (1.27 cm) from the edge, cut your bread into four more strips. You should have 16 cubes at this point, each of them uniform in shape and size. A 16-cube piece assumes you are using a standard size bread loaf. Cubing a Full Loaf Grab a large bread knife. Although a small bread knife--also called a serrated knife--will work fine for a few slices of bread, you will need a large bread knife (five inches or more(12.7 cm or more)) to successfully cut an entire loaf in one sitting. Slice the loaf into four to six strips lengthwise. Rather than cutting one or two slices of bread into strips, cut an entire loaf into strips the length of the loaf. This will expedite the cubing process so you are not cutting an entire loaf slice by slice. Cut each strip in half. Once your have your lengthwise strips, cut them in half to make the loaf easier to handle. You can cut them in half lengthwise and again from top to bottom, or you can only cut them once lengthwise--whichever makes handling the bread easier for you. Cut each new piece into strips. Once you have your smaller, more manageable chunks of bread, begin cutting these into slices. They should be roughly the length of your fingers, and a half-inch (1.27 cm) wide. Cut the remaining strips into half-inch cubes. Turn your strips horizontal, and cut them into half-inch (1.27 cm) cubes, making sure the knife has completely sliced through the bread each time. Cubing By Tearing Tear your bread into one-by-one pieces. Tear your bread into small pieces, trying to keep them as close to one-inch squares as possible. Although the edges will be somewhat jagged and uneven, you still want the cubes to be the same basic size. Start along the crust and move in. When you tear, tear all of the crust first before moving onto the inside of the bread. This will help keep the bread pieces the same basic size, and will give you a better idea if you are getting off track. Use the pad of your thumb to keep pieces uniform. One easy way to keep your bread cubes the same size is to use the pad of your thumb as a measuring tool. Press your thumb against the bread and tear around the width of your thumb. Tear into 16-18 pieces per slice. To give yourself a better chance of uniformity, aim for 16-18 cubes per piece of bread. Like knife cubing, you can do multiple pieces of bread at once to save time.
