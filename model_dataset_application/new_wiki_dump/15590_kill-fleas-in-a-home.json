          "description":"The easiest way to kill fleas is when they are at their most vulnerable: in the egg and larval stages of their development. This mixture will help prevent a full bloom of fleas. Borates are minerals that are used widely as wood preservatives, detergents, and insecticides, acting as stomach poisons to fleas. An adult flea will live on average 2 to 3 months and as long as 100 days without blood from its host. Newly hatched larvae, on the other hand, must feed within 3 days or they\u2019ll starve. So it's easiest by far to attack the larvae first."

          "description":"If you have pets, you can also dust the dog or cat's bed. It's best to do this when you're leaving your house for a good while, say 24 hours. Arrange for your pets to be out of the house during this time, too. Let the mixture settle for a day. When you come back, vacuum the carpet, the furniture, and wash the sheets on both beds. Take care not to breathe in the botanical dust and borate mixture. Use a mask when applying the dust mixture in the home. Use the insecticide in well-ventilated areas and wear gloves. Repeated exposure to insecticides can be harmful to pet and human health. Because of the long flea life cycle, 2 or 3 insecticide treatments, spaced 3 weeks apart, are often needed to completely rid your home of a flea infestation."

          "headline":"Set several flea traps out in your home along with the borate mix.",
          "description":"Flea traps work by producing light over the trap, which itself contains a flea-killing insecticide. Setting out traps will ensure that you kill any fleas that aren\u2019t killed by the borate mix. Fleas are attracted to the heat and the brightness of the light, and fall into the trap, where they are killed by the poison. If you have inquisitive pets who might try to open and eat the contents of the flea trap, set the in a place they cannot access. Or, place the flea traps in rooms that you can keep your pets out of."

Be sure to move furniture and vacuum underneath it, and also vacuum rugs and out-of-the-way sections of carpet. Then, vacuum off any upholstered furniture as well. Most fleas will not be able to survive a good vacuum! People often go for high-powered, super-suction vacuums, but the average vacuum should do the trick perfectly. Always discard the vacuum bag after you vacuum. This will help discourage re-infestation."

Then, place the mixture next to a low-hanging light source, preferably a night-light. The fleas are attracted to the light. Approaching the light, many of them will fall into the mixture and die in the process. The water and dish detergent mixture is like a toxic swimming pool for fleas. When they jump into the mixture, they die. If you don\u2019t have a shallow bowl, an old Frisbee does the job quite well."

You can also place cedar chips in a cotton cloth between the cushions on your furniture, underneath your pillow and, if possible, in your bedding. This will ensure that your bed remains pest-free. Fleas hate the smell of cedar and will do almost anything to avoid it. Cedar chips are available in your local pet or home-supply store. Make sure your pet isn't allergic to cedar. Many dogs can be allergic to cedar. If your dog has an allergic reaction to the cedar\u2014e.g., sneezing or swollen eyes\u2014stop using the cedar chips."

          "headline":"Spread salt over the surface of your carpet.",
          "description":"Salt is a desiccant, meaning it saps the moisture from things and dries them out. When a salt crystal attaches itself to a flea, it will cause chafing and scraping on the flea, essentially bleeding the flea to death as it walks. After 7\u201310 days, vacuum the salted area very thoroughly, making sure to pick up all the salt and flea carcasses from the carpet area. Repeat the salting process 1 or 2 more times. Use very fine-grained salt for this. The finer the better; you want it to be small enough to attach to the flea. When you're done vacuuming, discard the old vacuum bag and replace it with a new one."

        {
          "headline":"Sprinkle food-grade diatomaceous earth around your house.",
          "description":"Much like salt, diatomaceous earth will kill fleas by chafing their bodies. Sprinkle a few spoonfuls over areas of carpet that are infested with fleas. You can also use diatomaceous earth preventatively by sprinkling some around the entrances to your home. Purchase diatomaceous earth at a feed store, a hardware store, or a home-supply store. You can put diatomaceous earth on your pets, as long as you keep it out of their eyes and ears. Sprinkle on your pet down the backbone and rub into the skin all over."

          "headline":"Spray floors and bedding with an Insect Growth Regulator (IGR).",
          "description":"IGRs are a type of chemical insecticide which stop the fleas from developing. The larvae simply die off, rather than becoming adult fleas which will reproduce and make more fleas to infest your home. The IGR thereby breaks the reproduction cycle. This allows you to bring large infestations under control. Typically, the mixed IGR will need to be applied 2 times, each about 3 weeks apart. The most economical method is to buy a concentrate and mix according to the directions that come with the product. You can purchase IGRs at a local hardware store. IGRs are not poisonous to mammals. This makes IGRs a good option around a house that has kids or small animals such as hamsters, reptiles, or fish.
