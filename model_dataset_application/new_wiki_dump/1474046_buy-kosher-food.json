OU stands for The Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, commonly known as the Orthodox Union. The OU label can only be put on kosher foods if those foods receive written permission from the Orthodox Union Kosher Division. The OU label has a separate Kosher for Passover certification, which is published in their annual Kosher Directory Passover Edition. For dairy products, look for the OU-D label (a U within an O-shaped circle with a dash and then a capital D next to it). The OU-D label can also mean that the food product contains dairy ingredients or has been processed on equipment that previously handled dairy. For meat and poultry products, look for the OU-M label (a U within an O-shaped circle with a dash and then a capital M next to it). The OU-M label can also mean that the food product contains meat and/or poultry ingredients or has been processed on equipment that previously handled meat."
