  "text":" Wash the strawberries in the strainer.  Cut a strawberry into four equal pieces. Do not cut the leaves off of the strawberries. Cut the banana into six equal pieces. Do not peel the banana yet to prevent browning from occurring. Take out the plastic skewers. If the skewers are metal, be sure to wash and dry before use. Peel three banana sections. Gather one cut strawberry. Grab one plastic (or metal skewer) and place the strawberry piece with a leaf on first. Push that piece to the top of the skewer. Next, place a banana piece on the skewer and push to the top of the skewer, followed by a strawberry piece. Keep alternating until you put one full strawberry on the skewer. Repeat steps 2 through 7 until all six bananas have been used.  Place all finished strawberry banana kabobs on a sheet of waxed paper and set aside.  Measure out 1 cup of chocolate chips and pour into a microwaveable bowl.  Place bowl into the microwave. Heat the bowl for 10 seconds and remove from microwave. Add a handful of unmelted chocolate chips to the bowl. ** Mix contents of semi-melted chocolate and chocolate chips for about 20 seconds. Repeat steps 11 and 12 until there is a smooth consistent texture of melted chocolate.  Once the chocolate is completely melted, take a clean spoon and dip into the chocolate bowl. Grab one completed strawberry banana kabob and whip the spoon back and forth while spinning the kabob. Make sure to cover the entire kabob with thin chocolate strips. Place finished kabob on wax paper to harden.  Repeat step 14 and 15 on each strawberry banana kabob.  The chocolate will start to harden inside the bowl. Before it completely hardens, repeat steps 11 and 12 to melt the chocolate. Let all the kabobs dry for about 10-15 minutes until the chocolate has hardened.  If there are extra strawberries and chocolate left over, repeat steps 11 and 12.  Dip strawberries halfway into bowl.  Place dipped strawberry on a new sheet of waxed paper.  Repeat steps 19 and 20 until all the strawberries are dipped.  Let the chocolate covered strawberries dry for 10-15 minutes.  Once dried, the strawberry banana kabobs and strawberries are ready to eat.  Finished. ",
