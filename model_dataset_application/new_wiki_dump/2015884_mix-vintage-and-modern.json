          "description":"When you're first starting out, pick one space to revamp instead of trying to do all your spaces at once. This will help you concentrate on the style and aesthetics of the particular space without getting overwhelmed by the larger project. For example, start with addressing the furniture in your living room and adding in a new piece or two that will bring either vintage or modern vibes into the space.Whether it's your living room, bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, or office, try looking at the space from different angles. Try to visualize how you could incorporate new or different pieces of furniture into it. For example, could your modern living room be enhanced by adding a vintage bookshelf? Or perhaps you could invest in a new set of modern armchairs for your traditionally vintage office."

          "description":"When combining vintage and modern pieces of furniture, one of the key elements is to pair opposites. For example, if you have an ornate, tufted sofa, pair it with a simple, streamlined coffee table. Or, if your kitchen is designed with white furniture and modern appliances, try adding a vintage armoire for excess storage.Tip: If your home tends to be either more modern or more vintage, keep your decor elements in that style 80% of the time. For the other 20%, add the opposite design element. This way, you can create a cohesive, unique space, that still feels put together."
