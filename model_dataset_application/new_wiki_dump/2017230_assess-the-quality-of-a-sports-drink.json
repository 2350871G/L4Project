          "description":"You will need different amounts of carbohydrates, depending on when and why you will be consuming the sports drink. A pre-workout drink may have more carbohydrates than a drink needed during a workout, or, a pre-workout drink may have fewer carbohydrates and only serve to keep you hydrated and help with water retention. Understand isotonic sports drinks. Isotonic sports drinks have 6 to 8% carbohydrates, water and electrolytes. An isotonic sports drink is an optimum beverage for during a workout. It has the best amount of carbohydrates to help maintain energy. If you are unsure which drink you need, an isotonic beverage is the best way to go because it is versatile and beneficial. Understand hypotonic sports drinks. This type has less than 6% carbohydrates and electrolytes. It doesn\u2019t contain enough carbohydrates to replenish muscle glycogen. These types of sports drinks are best for hydration only. They can be consumed during a workout lasting less than 60 minutes, before a workout or after a workout. The electrolytes will help with fluid retention. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/1\\/1d\\/Assess-the-Quality-of-a-Sports-Drink-Step-1Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Assess-the-Quality-of-a-Sports-Drink-Step-1Bullet2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/1\\/1d\\/Assess-the-Quality-of-a-Sports-Drink-Step-1Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Assess-the-Quality-of-a-Sports-Drink-Step-1Bullet2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nUnderstand hypertonic sports drinks. These contain electrolytes and more than 8% carbohydrates. Hypertonic fluids are not good for during a workout or after a workout because of the high carbohydrate load. They can cause digestion to slow and rehydration to slow because of the amount of carbohydrates the body is trying to digest. Hypertonic fluids are best consumed when carbohydrate loading at least an hour before a workout. They will help with pre-workout muscle glycogen stores. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/ab\\/Assess-the-Quality-of-a-Sports-Drink-Step-1Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Assess-the-Quality-of-a-Sports-Drink-Step-1Bullet3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/ab\\/Assess-the-Quality-of-a-Sports-Drink-Step-1Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Assess-the-Quality-of-a-Sports-Drink-Step-1Bullet3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"

Avoid sports drinks with high fructose corn syrup or fructose as the main ingredient for energy. Alone, fructose slows digestion and will not absorb as quickly as needed to restore muscle glycogen.
