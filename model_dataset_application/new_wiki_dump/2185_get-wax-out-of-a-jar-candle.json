You can prevent this by slicing the wax up inside the jar using a butter knife. When the wax freezes, it will break into smaller pieces. The smaller pieces will be easier to take out than one big piece. You can use this technique on shaped candle holders as well. If you are using a regular candle holder with straight walls, then you do not need to slice the wax up."
