          "description":"While Hoya plants need a lot of sunlight to thrive, direct sunlight can cause them to bleach or dry out. As a result, try to place your Hoya so it gets about 6 hours of indirect sunlight per day. If you notice that one side of the plant gets more sun, rotate your Hoya every few months so that the whole plant gets the sunlight it needs. If you store your Hoya outdoors during the warmer months, make sure that you do not place it directly in the sun\u2019s rays. Instead, choose a porch or area that is partially covered but still bright."

In order to keep your Hoya alive, the room temperature will need to be at least 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C). While Hoyas tend to thrive in temperatures below 80 \u00b0F (27 \u00b0C), they can tolerate heat up to 95 \u00b0F (35 \u00b0C). If you live in a warmer climate, you can keep your Hoya outside as long as the temperature conditions are right. When the temperatures start to drop in the fall and winter, however, you will likely need to bring your Hoya indoors."

To expose your Hoya to higher humidity, try to store it in a place that has a higher humidity, such as a sun porch or greenhouse. If you don\u2019t have a place to expose your Hoya to high humidity inside, you can put your Hoya outside on humid days to help it grow and thrive. When putting your Hoya outside, make sure that it is not directly in the sun."

Sitting it water for too long can lead to root rot, which can quickly cause your Hoya to die. If the current pot doesn\u2019t have a drainage hole, you can avoid root rot by drilling a drainage hole into the existing pot or repotting your Hoya into a new pot with drainage."

They prefer to be rootbound, so as long as your Hoya is doing well in its current pot, avoid repotting it. If your Hoya is outgrowing its pot and needs to be repotted, however, make sure that you repot it in a pot that allows for plenty of drainage out the bottom. Try to repot your Hoya plant in the spring or summer, when the plant is at its strongest."

          "headline":"Use a lighter soil mix to allow for better drainage.",
          "description":"Because Hoyas are so sensitive to over watering, they generally thrive in lighter, less dense soil mixtures. Orchid soil mixtures, peat moss, and succulent and cactus mixes are all great options for Hoyas because they allow the water to drain. If you want to use a traditional commercial potting soil, add perlite according to the instructions on the perlite bag to lighten up the soil and allow for better drainage."

          "description":"To see if your Hoya plant needs to be watered, touch the top of the soil. If the soil is still a bit damp, wait a few more days and check again. If the soil is completely dry, water your Hoya plant just enough so that the soil is moist. Hoya plants are very sensitive to over watering, so make sure that you don\u2019t pour so much water in that the water pools or floods the top of the pot. In the spring and summer months, Hoya plants generally need to be watered about once every week. In the fall and winter, Hoyas can typically be watered less, about once every 2 weeks. In general, it is better to under water your Hoya than over water it. If you under water your Hoya, the leaves will start to wilt and/or turn yellow. If this happens, water your Hoya more often. If you over water your Hoya, however, it will likely cause root rot and lead the plant to die."

          "description":"While your Hoya is still maturing, you can help by feeding it with a high nitrogen fertilizer 1 to 2 times per month during the spring and summer months. Once your Hoya has grown, opt for a high phosphorous fertilizer instead to encourage your Hoya\u2019s flowers to bloom. Avoid using fertilizer on your Hoya during the fall and winter months, as the plant generally stops growing during this period and needs time to rest."

Prune these away, as well as any other cosmetic pruning you choose to do. When pruning your Hoya, though, be careful not to cut off the long tendrils or old flower stems, as these tend to be the places where the Hoya\u2019s new flowers will begin to develop."

First, select a vine-training bamboo, wood, or iron structure in the shape that you want your vine to grow in, such as a U-hoop or trellis. Then, use the twine to tie the Hoya\u2019s existing vines up the bamboo as far as they will go. As the vines on your Hoya grow, they will grow upwards and around the vine-support structure. Make sure that you tie the twine so that the knots are secure enough to hold and support the Hoya vines as they grow upward, but not so tight that they cut off the plant\u2019s growth. If the vines on the Hoya begin to grow away from the bamboo, wood, or iron support structure at any point, you can use more twine to secure the new growth to the structure."

To deal with these pesky infestations, spray your Hoya plant with neem oil. The amount of neem oil needed depends on the specific product and mixture that you use, so make sure that you follow the directions on the bottle.

While the mold will generally flake off once the pest infestation is under control, you can help your Hoya recover by wiping off the sooty mold when you see it. To do this, mix 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of household liquid detergent per 3 litres (0.79 US gal) of water in a water bottle.
