          "description":"As with any produce, you should make sure to rinse the bean sprouts well to remove any dirt or bacteria that might be on them. Run your fingers lightly over the delicate sprouts while they\u2019re under the water to clean them without causing damage. If it\u2019s going to be a few minutes before you add the bean sprouts to the boiling water, lightly pat them dry with paper towels so they don\u2019t get soggy. Since bean sprouts are so small, you may want to place a colander in the sink while you're washing them so they don't fall down the drain if you drop a few."

Fill the pot about 2/3 of the way with water so it doesn\u2019t boil over, then place the pot on the stove and bring the water to a rolling boil over high heat. A rolling boil means the entire surface of the water is bubbling, and the boiling doesn\u2019t stop if you stir the water."

          "description":"Getting the ice bath ready ahead of time will help prevent your bean sprouts from overcooking. If you don\u2019t have any ice available, very cold water will work, but ice water is the most effective at immediately stopping the cooking process. The ice water will help preserve the crispness of your bean sprouts after they\u2019ve been frozen. If you're working with a large number of bean sprouts, you may need to add more ice after a few batches, since the heat from the bean sprouts will gradually melt the ice."

          "description":"Even though you\u2019re working with a large pot, it\u2019s better to blanch a handful of bean sprouts at a time. Adding too many sprouts at one time will cause them to cook unevenly, and the finished product will be harder to control. If you have a lot of bean sprouts, it may take several batches to blanch them all. However, since each batch only takes a few minutes to prepare, it\u2019s worth the extra time."

This method instantly stops the bean sprouts from cooking, leaving them tender yet crunchy. Take the bean sprouts out of the water once they have cooled. They may become soggy if you leave them in the water for too long. If you\u2019re preparing more than one batch of bean sprouts, add another handful of sprouts to the boiling water while you\u2019re chilling the first batch. This method is used to cook a wide variety of different vegetables, but it\u2019s especially effective for delicate veggies like bean sprouts."
