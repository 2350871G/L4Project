If you\u2019re buying a steamer for a restaurant or commercial use, go with a larger one, like one that\u2019s 30 inches (76 cm).

Choose your steaming time based on the texture and temperature you prefer your food, too. For example, if you like softer veggies, steam them longer than if you like crunchier ones. Use a meat thermometer to measure when meat is done cooking. For instance, cook chicken until it's at least 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C). Check the water level every so often as the food cooks.
