Many date-pickers climb barefoot, but that may not be a good idea if you're not used to it. If you do wear shoes, pick ones where you can get a good grip while climbing. Another option is an electronic tree lift, which allows you to go up and view the dates without climbing the tree. It also allows easier access to the dates, as they hang outward away from the tree."

However, you'll use a static rope instead of a stretchy dynamic rope. A certain type of knot, the Black's Hitch, creates friction and stops you if you begin to fall. You should also use a climbing helmet, which you can find at most sporting goods stores. Typically, tree harnesses have better seating and more padding than climbing harnesses since you spend more time in them."

Check throughout the season to harvest the ripe dates. If you don't have a lift, you may need to cut the stalks off before harvesting. Some dates, particularly those classified as \"soft\" dates, are very fragile. You can't just toss them in a bag. You need to gently place them in a container. Medjool dates, for instance, are considered soft dates."
