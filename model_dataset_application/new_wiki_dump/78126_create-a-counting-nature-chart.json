These items could include: acorns, leaves, pebbles, grasses, twigs, nuts, plant matter (such as fluff surrounding seeds, buds etc. ), animal fur tufts (often caught on prickly plants/fences etc. ), flowers, seeds, feathers, nuts and so on. It is important to collect \"lots\" of some of the items so that you will have enough to create numbers 1 - 10 on your chart. The easier things to collect more of include: leaves, pebbles and seeds."
