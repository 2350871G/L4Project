          "description":"For most plastics, you can simply use a few drops of dishwashing soap in 1 cup (240 mL) of warm water. With car headlights or other car plastics, you may want to spring for a car soap, as it will be gentler on the surface of your car if you happen to get it past the plastic areas. If you're cleaning a large object, such as vinyl siding, you can just use plain water and a hose to spray it down as well as you can."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Rub the soap mixture in with a light scrubbing cloth or sponge.",
          "description":"Dip the sponge or rag into the cleaning mixture. Rub it on the plastic in a circular motion. Your goal is to remove as much of the dirt and debris as you can from the surface, as it can continue to scratch the plastic if you don't. If the plastic you're cleaning is small, you can use a cotton ball and rubbing alcohol instead. If some of the dirt is stubborn, try a melamine sponge and water to help remove it."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Rinse the object clean.",
          "description":"Once the plastic is free from dirt, simply use a clean rag and water to wipe the soap off. You can also use a hose if you're cleaning headlights or run the object under a faucet if it's something smaller."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Check the depth of scratches with your nail.",
          "description":"Run your nail lightly across the plastic, perpendicular to the scratch. If it doesn't catch, then the scratch is minor enough to use a mild abrasive. For deeper scratches, you'll need heavy-duty sandpaper."

        {
          "headline":"Apply masking tape or painter's tape to areas you don't want to be sanded.",

After making sure the area is clean and dry, line tape up against the edge of the headlights on all sides. Use your fingers to smooth out the tape. Painter's tape works well for this because it comes up easily, but masking tape should suffice, too."

Simply put a pea-sized dab on a cotton cloth or even a clean toothbrush and rub the scratched area in a circular motion. Keep working until the scratches are gone. Wash the paste off to make it easier to see if the scratches are gone. This works best on plastics that are injection molded. You can tell because they'll have a small dimple on the bottom."

Use a cotton ball, cloth, or even a clean toothbrush to apply the paste to the plastic. Rub the area with small, circular motions to remove the scratches. Rinse off the paste from time to time so you can see how your work is progressing."

After a few minutes, the scratch should be gone. It will also work to buff up soft plastics, like motorcycle trim. You can also use a buffing wheel attached to a drill. Hold the wheel close to the plastic instead of the other way around. Both acrylic and polycarbonate are very hard plastics. Acrylic is tougher than polycarbonate, and you can identify polycarbonate by its dark edge."

          "headline":"Try a liquid progressive polishing system for acrylic and polycarbonate.",
          "description":"Start by putting the roughest polish on a rag and rubbing at the scratch in a circular motion until the edges of the scratch are mostly gone. Wipe it off. Then, move on to the next roughest, applying it in a circular motion. Once that's worn down the scratch, remove it with a rag. Finally, use the smoothest polisher to finish up. It should leave a smooth, scratch-free surface. You can purchase these at most home improvement stores. If you're working with polycarbonate, which has a dark edge, start with the second roughest. This will work well on car headlights."

The finer sandpaper will produce a smoother finish. Make sure to get sandpaper meant for wet sanding so it doesn't fall apart. You can also use sandpaper on car headlights."

Keep moving around the area, spraying and scrubbing. When you're finished, spray the area down with a hose to finish. For a stronger cleaner, mix \u20443 cup (160 mL) of a household cleaner, \u20443 cup (79 mL) of laundry detergent, and 4 cups (0.95 L) of bleach into 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water. Be sure you DO NOT use a cleaner with ammonia. Mixing bleach and ammonia creates toxic fumes. Try a cleaner like Pinesol or Simple Green."
