Find one you like, then search for a stuffed toy dog that represents the preferred breed. For example, if you like a German Shepherd, you'd probably look for a German Shepherd plush. Look at online toy stores, trading, and auction sites to give you more choices. It's fun to have your toy dog mailed to you. If you can't afford the toy yet, start saving up or ask for it as a gift for your birthday or another special occasion."
