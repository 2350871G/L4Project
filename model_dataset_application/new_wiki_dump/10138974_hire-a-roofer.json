          "description":"Before you trust someone to work on your roof, it\u2019s a good idea to learn a little about what they\u2019ll be doing. Go online and read up on both repair jobs and full installations or replacements. Pay particular attention to the types of tools, materials, practices and procedures involved. Much more goes into installing or replacing a roof than just laying shingles. There\u2019s also the matter of flashing, gutters, and the plywood decking underlying the roofing materials themselves. By becoming acquainted with the work involved, you\u2019ll have a better idea about what types of questions to ask your roofer, as well as what to expect once they get started."

Consider the size, color, and arrangement of shingles or other materials, as well as how they\u2019ll stand up to the kind of weather conditions common in your neck of the woods. You can also find lots of helpful information on roofing materials and styles online on popular home improvement sites like Today\u2019s Homeowner and Better Homes and Gardens. To have a non-residential roofing system installed in a material such as metal, TPO, or PVC, you\u2019ll need to hire out a specialty contractor with the necessary credentials and expertise."

These will lay out every step of the project in detail, from the specific equipment needed to the optimal outdoor conditions for completing the job safely and efficiently. A representative at the store where you\u2019re doing your shopping should be able to print you off a copy of the full manufacturer\u2019s instructions, or you can pull them up in digital form directly on the company\u2019s website. Different installation methods are required for different materials. Certain materials also call for other specialized equipment and accessories, such as fasteners or underlays."

Ask the contractor to explain their reasoning for why each of the roof\u2019s components should stay or go.
