Go to a larger grocery store and look at their winter fruit selections to see what you have available locally. Experiment and taste different winter fruit in their raw form to see how they taste.

          "description":"One factor that may help you narrow down your cooking options with winter fruit may be their health benefits. Different fruits offer different vitamins and nutrients. This is especially important for those on a strict diet or those with dietary restrictions due to a health condition. Oranges are loaded with vitamin C and help prevent cold and flu viruses. Pomegranates are a rich source of iron, phytochemicals, antioxidants, polyphenols and Vitamin C. They are also good for your cardiovascular health. Bananas are a healthy source of potassium and can help you maintain a healthy blood pressure."

The best way to get an understanding of cooking with these fruits is by practicing. Use them in your favorite recipes that utilize fruit already, such as pies. For example, the Asian pear require longer cooking times than conventional pears because of their crunchy texture."

For example, a recipe that calls for oranges can be replaced with a winter fruit like clementines. Replacing raisins with dried cranberries is also another good option."

          "description":"Savory sandwiches surprisingly taste great with pear slices. The pear adds a sweetness, lightness, and crunchiness that is often left absent from a grilled cheese sandwich. To create this grilled cheese, layer your cheese and pear on a slice of bread. Place your bread in a hot, greased skillet with butter or spray. Place another slice of bread over it and set the heat to medium low. Cook the sandwich for three minutes or until the bread is crispy and brown. Flip the sandwich over and cook it for another three minutes. You can also add a protein like ham or roast beef to your sandwich."

Great winter fruit choices for salads include blood oranges and sliced pears. Experiment with sweet and sour dressings, such as ginger dressings in combination with these fruits.

          "description":"You can use citrus winter fruit as a glaze on top of proteins like fish, beef, and chicken. Marinating your food with blood oranges will impart a sweet flavor to your protein. To use winter fruit as a marinade, use freshly squeezed juice from a citrus fruit that you prefer and combine it with spices like garlic powder, salt, red pepper flakes, oregano, or pepper. Have your meat sit in the marinade for a couple of hours or overnight, so it absorbs the flavors of the citrus and spices. This will result in juicier and tastier proteins. You can fruit like oranges, lemons, or passion fruit. To make a more advanced marinade, you can also combine things like vegetable oil and red wine vinegar to the marinade. Adding a citrus winter fruit glaze to fish will impart a tangy, sweet and sour taste."

          "description":"Thinly sliced pieces of apple or rhubarb can impart a crunchy and fresh texture to the savory dishes that you cook. In addition to creating a different flavor profile, sliced winter fruit as a garnish can also be colorful and aesthetically pleasing. Choose garnishes that go with your main course. Get creative and make the garnish look aesthetically pleasing by finely slicing it or presenting it in a creative way. You can also add things like blood orange slices as another simple garnish that will enhance the flavor of the meal. Sweeter fruit like pears and apples go great with poultry while citrus fruits like oranges and lemons go great on fish."
