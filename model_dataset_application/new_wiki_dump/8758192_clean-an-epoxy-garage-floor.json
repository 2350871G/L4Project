          "description":"You can purchase a dust mop at most department stores or hardware stores. Once a week, run a dust mop over the full surface of your epoxy garage floor. This should only take a few minutes and should remove most dust and dirt from an epoxy garage floor. Aim for a dust mop that is 24 to 36 inches wide."

          "description":"Most dirt and grime should come off with a dust mop. However, if anything does not come off during your weekly mopping, use a damp rag or towel to gently rub down any set in dirt. As epoxy floors do not easily build up dirt, most grime can be wiped off with water alone. Detergent, cleaners, and soap are rarely necessary unless you're deep cleaning spills or stains. If you regularly mop with detergent, cleaners, or soap, a soapy residue may build up on your epoxy floors. To get rid of the residue, mix 4\u20135 fluid ounces (120\u2013150 mL) of ammonia with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of hot water, and mop the floors with it."

Once a month, use a vacuum cleaner to vacuum dust out of these grooves and cracks to keep them clean. While it's easiest to use a vacuum cleaner, you can sweep dust out of saw cuts using a broom if you don't have one."

Most cleaners should be diluted in water first. Check your cleaner's instructions for the precise ratios to use. Place your cleaner in spray bottles and spray it on the floor. Rub it in using your foam mop, specially targeting any areas with stuck on dirt and debris. When you're done, dip your mop in a bucket of warm water and use this to rinse cleaner residue off the floor. When done, it's safe to let your floor air dry. However, you can also wipe it dry with paper towels if you need it dry right away. If you do not want to use a commercial cleaner, you can mix half a cup of ammonia with a gallon of hot water."

Then, scrub the marks off using a stiff bristled nylon brush. For stubborn marks, you may need to add a second layer of cleaner or degreaser and then scrub again. If you find you're scrubbing very hard without any progress, stop and add another layer of your degreaser or cleaner. Scrubbing too hard can hurt your floor's finish."

Do not use detergent or kitchen cleaners on garage epoxy floors. The scrubbing pad should be all you need to remove rust. If you're having a hard time getting the rust off with the scrubbing pad alone, you can use CLR (a commercial calcium, lime, and rust remover) to remove it. Just mix equal parts CLR and warm water, and scrub the solution into the rust with a scrubbing pad."
