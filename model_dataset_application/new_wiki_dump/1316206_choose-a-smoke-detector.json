      "description":"Smoke detectors detect smoke using one or more of the kinds of sensors described below. Ionization alarms work by ionizing the air inside the smoke alarm with trace amounts of a radioactive element, americium 241. This sets up an electric current within the smoke detector. Smoke particles entering the ionization chamber disrupt the current, triggering the alarm. Ionization alarms are better at detecting the tinier smoke particles from fires that ignite quickly, such as paper and grease fires or fires caused by arsonists. Some ionization smoke alarms are integrated with carbon monoxide detectors. Photoelectric alarms use a small pulsating (strobe) light; smoke particles entering the detection chamber diffract the light onto a sensor to trigger the alarm. Photoelectric alarms are better at detecting the larger smoke particles from slow, smoldering fires, such as electrical fires or those in bedding, clothing, or upholstery. They are usually more costly than ionization alarms, but they are less susceptible to being triggered accidentally. Dual-sensor smoke alarms incorporate both ionization and photoelectric sensor components. They are the most costly but provide the best smoke detection for home use. (You can also buy both separate ionization and photoelectric smoke detectors and use them together.) Another type of smoke detector, the air-sampling smoke detector, uses a sensor in a network of pipes through which air is circulated, to determine whether smoke from a fire is present. They are similar to ionization alarms but more sensitive and geared for business and scientific environments (warehouses and laboratories) where a higher degree of smoke sensing is called for. Some manufacturers now offer \"combination\" alarms that include sensors for carbon monoxide in addition to smoke, which may be useful in homes having fuel-burning appliances or an attached garage. Note that sensitivity of CO sensors often does not last as long as smoke detectors, so combination units may need more frequent replacement."

      "description":"Many smoke detectors run on 9-volt, AA, or AAA batteries, which must be replaced periodically. (Manufacturers suggest replacing the batteries once a year, when you adjust your clocks to go on or off Daylight Savings Time.) Some smoke alarms are equipped with lithium batteries designed to last for the 10-year life of the unit, while others are designed to be wired into household current and have backup batteries that kick in when the power goes out. Some regulations now require all new homes (or remodeled homes) to have smoke alarms that are \"hard-wired\" to the household current and wired to each other, with or without battery backup. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/fe\\/Choose-a-Smoke-Detector-Step-2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Choose-a-Smoke-Detector-Step-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/fe\\/Choose-a-Smoke-Detector-Step-2.jpg\\/aid1316206-v4-728px-Choose-a-Smoke-Detector-Step-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Fair_use\\\">Fair Use<\\/a> (screenshot)<br>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"

If you have a large house, consider getting a smoke alarm system where the individual smoke detectors are wired together so that when one detects smoke, they all sound.
