Try to position the thermometer so it\u2019s halfway down the fish, and not touching the cooking surface. If the thermometer reads 135 \u00b0F (57 \u00b0C) or higher, stop cooking the fish. Even after you take the fillet off of the cooking surface, it will still continue to cook from residual heat. If the fillet or fish slice is over the designated internal temperature, there\u2019s a chance that your fish might be overcooked."

Turn the fork gently to see if the fish flakes apart under a small amount of pressure. If the fish doesn\u2019t flake or separate slightly, then it needs to be cooked for longer. Underdone fish tends to be firm on the inside. While you don\u2019t want to cook the fish for too long, you definitely want to avoid serving a fish that feels firm to the touch."

Use the flat edge of the knife to peel back the outer layer of the meat, which allows you to see how done the fish is. If the fish still looks translucent, then be sure to cook it for longer. Cooked fish should look cloudy and opaque in color."

For instance, if you\u2019re pan-searing or saut\u00e9ing a piece of fish that\u2019s 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick, be sure to flip it over between 3\u00bd and 5 minutes of cooking time."

If a quick inspection reveals that the fish pieces aren\u2019t baked enough, let them cook for 2-4 more minutes. Since fish can go from underdone to overdone very quickly, be sure to bake in small increments of time. If a baked fish flakes after you press on the surface with the back of a spoon, then it\u2019s ready to be served. This is an especially good way to test larger fish, like salmon, cod, sea bass, and halibut."

Wait for the fish to look opaque on 1 side before flipping it over again. Remember: you can always cook an underdone fish, but you can\u2019t undercook an overdone fish!
