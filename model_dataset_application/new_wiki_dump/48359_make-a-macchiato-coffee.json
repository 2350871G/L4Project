Measure the beans and transfer them to a coffee grinder. Grind the beans until they're finely ground. Finely ground coffee beans are about the size of salt grains. This is the ideal grind for espresso. You can also buy pre-ground espresso beans from grocery stores and coffee shops if you don\u2019t have a grinder."
