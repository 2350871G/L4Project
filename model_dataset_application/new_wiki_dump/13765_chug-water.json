Most water bottles feature a very narrow bottleneck, which slows the water as it pours from the container. Technically speaking, you will be able to chug the most water at once from a bottleneck that most perfectly matches the size of your mouth. Bear in mind that your throat may not be able to keep up with this volume of water. If you do use a plastic water bottle, you can try scrunching the end of the bottle as you chug. This will force the water out of the bottle more quickly than it would flow otherwise. Again, bear in mind that faster does not mean healthier."

If the water source doesn't limit the speed at which the water can pour into your throat, you will need to manually regulate the flow. Don't tip the container on its end \u2013 keep the water coming out at a manageable rate."

This way, you won't need to engage your throat muscles to physically suck the water down your gullet. You should be able to chug more quickly as a result. Don't tip your head back forward until you're done chugging water. If you shift your throat passage while the water is still draining, then that water might be slowed by the muscle contraction. This can cause you to choke. Never chug while lying down. Chugging while horizontal increases the likelihood that the water will slip into your windpipe, causing you to choke."
