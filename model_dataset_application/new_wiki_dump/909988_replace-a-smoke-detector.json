If the detector does not beep, something is wrong. You may hear all of your smoke alarms beep while only testing one of them; this is normal, and indicates the smoke detector in question is functioning properly.

Replace the batteries in the units you\u2019ve identified as malfunctioning and re-test them. Remember that  smoke detectors should be replaced every 10 years, even if replacing the batteries fixes them temporarily. To replace the batteries:\n\nRemove the detector from the mounting. Most smoke detectors simply require a quarter turn counterclockwise. The detector should now only be attached to a few wires coming out of the ceiling or wall. Replace the batteries. Most smoke detectors use 9V batteries. The battery compartment should be visible on the back side of the detector, remove the cover and replace the battery. Reattach the detector. Replace the battery cover and hold the smoke detector up against the mounting. Turning the detector clockwise should reattach it to the mount. Re-test your detector.

If you don\u2019t have a CO detector in your house, this is a good option. It is only necessary if you use gas in the house. Wireless smoke detectors are convenient, but they can only connect to other wireless alarms of the same model. If you\u2019re replacing all of the smoke detectors in your house and choose the wireless option, make sure to purchase the same make and model. Check the manufacture date. Since smoke alarms have a fairly static 10-year lifetime, buying one that has been on the shelf for two years will only give you 8 years of use."
