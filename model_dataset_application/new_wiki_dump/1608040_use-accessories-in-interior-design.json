          "description":"You can find inspiration from the current season or upcoming holiday motifs or colors. These can make great ways to freshen up your accessories every 3-4 months. Find inspiration from the weather outside or the current holiday, and choose decorations to match. For example, if springtime is soon, you can choose pastel-colored throw pillows, vases, and centerpieces. In addition, if winter is around the corner, you can decorate with blue and silver or red and green. You can choose to add a few subtle accessories or swap out all of them for seasonal ones. Either way, it will be a nice change for the room!"

          "description":"A floor rug can be a lovely statement piece, and you can match other colors or textures based on the rug you choose. If you want a rug on the smaller side, go with a 4 ft \u00d7 6 ft (1.2 m \u00d7 1.8 m) or 5 ft \u00d7 8 ft (1.5 m \u00d7 2.4 m) sized rug. For larger rugs, select 1 that is 11 ft \u00d7 13 ft (3.4 m \u00d7 4.0 m) or larger. Pick a rug with a rich color or pattern if you have neutral furniture, or go with a neutral or solid-colored rug if your furniture is loud. Make sure the rug is proportional to the furniture in the room. For instance, if you put a rug under your dining table, make sure it is large enough to accomodate the chairs when they\u2019re pulled out."

        {
          "headline":"Hang art you enjoy on your walls, to add a pop of color.",
          "description":"Pick out pieces of artwork in stores or online that fit your color preferences and design appeal. Inspect your walls to find the right spot, and choose a location based on any other decorations you have. It is best to hang artwork around eye level or higher, just be sure to leave 12 inches (30 cm) of space between the artwork and the ceiling. You can choose a framed item or go with a wall sculpture or tapestry. To install your art, hammer a nail into your wall where you wish to hang it, and place the back of the frame or canvas on the hook. You can shop in order to decorate particular rooms, or choose pieces you like and then figure out where to arrange them in your house. Choose 1 large artwork or 3-5 small- to medium-sized paintings, for example. Odd numbers of artwork makes it look like a collection. You can also hang 9-11 prints on your walls to create a gallery."

          "description":"Choose attractive lamps that you like, and put them in poorly-lit areas of your house. You can also purchase decorative lamp shades to add some texture to your lighting, if you\u2019d like. You can place a floor lamp in the corner of your living room or a desk lamp on top of an end table, for example."

          "headline":"Use plants throughout your rooms to include some natural elements.",
          "description":"Use elements from nature to incorporate beautiful and versatile accessories. Placing plants around your home makes your rooms feel fresh and alive, and they also are great accents to fill up empty spaces. Plants look great in window sills, in your living room, and as centerpieces. Use plants like elephant ears if you want a large potted plant, pick a fern if you want a plant that will grow over time, or try air plants or succulents if you want small, no-maintenance plants. If your room is particularly modern in style, you may want to skip using plants. They often look wild and chaotic, and this may not match your streamlined look."

          "headline":"Pile on throw pillows on your bed and sofa, adding a coziness and comfort.",
          "description":"Pillows are one of the easiest ways to accessorize! They quickly give your living room, bedroom, or office extra color and texture. You can choose bright color combinations, pillows with embellishments or beading, or neutral-toned throw pillows. Throw an odd number of pillows onto your couch or bed to keep design rules in mind. For example, if you have a bright red couch, choose black or grey pillows for a modern look. If you have a neutral couch in colors like white, beige, tan, or black, go with colorful or patterned pillows! You can purchase throw pillows at department stores, home decorating stores, or online. You can easily switch out the pillows based on the upcoming holiday or season."

          "headline":"Accessorize your dining table with napkin rings, napkins, and chargers.",
          "description":"If you want to elevate the look of your table setting, first place chargers at each seat on top of a placemat, and put your dinner plate on top of it. You can stack a salad or side plate on top as well, if you\u2019d like. Then, use decorative, unique napkin rings in your favorite color or theme, and place your napkin on top. This is an easy way to accessorize your dining room. For example, you can choose bright aqua, magenta, and purple chargers if you like bright colors, or go for different tones of grey or brown for a monotone look. You can also fold 2 napkins together in contrasting shades to add a splash of color. In addition, you can add centerpieces or decorative glassware for other accessory options."

Having a center point of your room helps keep things balanced. Some rooms have built-in focal points, like large windows or a fireplace. Other focal points include a rug, television, or patterned couch. You can also paint 1 wall a different color to create your own focal point."

          "description":"Examine the colors in your focal point, and choose 1 or 2 hues to accent your room. Pillows are great accessories to add a splash of color to your space, and matching colors to your focal point creates unity and cohesion. For example, if your rug in your living room is primarily blue, red, green, and purple, you can pair this with blue and purple throw pillows on your couch."

          "headline":"Get candle holders or vases in similar colors to your pillows.",
          "description":"After you choose a few throw pillows, you can pick other accessories in the similar colors. Place these items on either your coffee tables or end tables. These will help tie the look together across the entire room! If you aren\u2019t a fan of candlesticks, you could place lanterns on your floor or above your fireplace. You can use lighter or darker hues of the same color to add some interest, if you'd like. If you\u2019re using a vase, you can also place real or fake flowers in similar colors inside the vase. This adds a fresh and pleasant touch to your space!"

          "headline":"Choose shelves and frames in a lighter shade of your colors to add cohesion.",
          "description":"Add decorative touches to your wall by using items like shelves or frames for your art in your color scheme. You can pull your room together by repeating similar colors throughout. It may look best to paint these in a lighter shade of your focal colors, though, so as to not make your room too loud. You can purchase plain or solid-colored shelves or frames and paint them yourself to perfectly match your displays. Simply purchase acrylic paint, and apply it using a thin paintbrush. For a classy and sophisticated look, pick black and white frames and match the artwork or photographs inside the frames to the colors of the focal point in the room."

          "headline":"Use personal or sentimental accessories, so your room feels like home.",
          "description":"To match your items to your room, you can incorporate items important to you or your family. Ideas include photo albums, vintage baseballs, or childhood art projects. These items can add a touch of individuality and make your spaces unique. If your items are valuable or particularly old, consider placing them in a shadow box or display case."

Play around with placement, and try putting an item somewhere else if it doesn't suit your fancy. For example, if you are not in love with the throw pillows on your bed, swap them out for throw pillows on your couch instead. Maybe they look better in a different location! Additionally, you can rearrange your knick-knacks on your shelves so all similar items are together. Or, choose to spread them out if you'd prefer!"

While 3 is the universal number of accessories to use, you can also try arranging 5, 7, or 9 accessories together as well. This looks great and helps add cohesion to your rooms. For example, when you are placing decorative items on your end tables, put 1 plant, 1 coaster, and 1 candle. If you have an area of your room that looks empty, decorate it with 3 pieces of furniture. You can place a desk, floor lamp, and chair there."

It also helps keep your living room looking open and airy. If your living room is not large enough to accommodate this, try to leave around 1 ft (0.30 m) of space."

If your paintings are too low, your ceilings may look limiting and it may look strange on your wall. Generally, your art should be between 56\u201360 in (140\u2013150 cm) from the floor. If you are hanging multiple pieces of art, try to keep the center of your entire arrangement at eye level. Some can go below or above if needed. For a more dramatic look, create a gallery wall with art from floor to ceiling. Just make sure no furniture or other items block the artwork."

Measure the size of your TV using a ruler or measuring tape, and multiply your measurement by 2. Then, place your couch this distance away from your TV.

You don't have to load up your accessories on your table just because you have the space. When it comes to decorating, less is more. Choose a few select items that make a statement and avoid distracting from them."
