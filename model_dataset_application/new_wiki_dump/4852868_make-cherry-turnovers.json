  "text":" Preparing the Dough Bring out your food processor. You will need this to make the dough. Combine the salt, sugar, flour, and baking powder. Put these in your food processor and press your pulse button. Bring together the shortening, and 1/2 of your butter cubes. Incorporate these into the mixture. Press the pulse button, and blend these ingredients until the mixture is hard and resembles gravel. Prepare a quarter cup of ice water. Add this to the mixture as well, and press the pulse button, allowing the mixture to have a few more \"rounds\" of blending. Carefully take everything out of your food processor. Set on a flat surface and separate the mixture into 2 disks (these should be rolled). Bring out plastic wrap, which should be used to cover the mixture. Transfer the mixture to your fridge and give it an hour (or more) to chill.  Preparing the Filling Take out your cherries and cut them in a non-smooth manner. Then, gather a medium saucepan and place your newly chopped cherries in the saucepan. Incorporate more salt and sugar into the mixture. Set your saucepan to medium heat and allow the mixture to heat up, and mix consistently. Use a spoon to remove four teaspoons of the juice from the cherries. Place in a small bowl. Add some cornstarch and blend well. Transfer the batter back to your saucepan. Continue allowing it to cook gently below a boiling point, and be sure to mix together throughout the time. In approximately 6 to 8 minutes, the batter should have thickened very much. Carefully take your batter out of the heat, and then let cool.  Turning the Dough Into Turnovers Take the plastic wrap off your disks, working with one disk at a time. Thoroughly cover a surface that's flat (and not dirty) with very much flour. Take out a rolling pin and unroll your disks. Continue this process until your dough is still thick (an-eighth of an inch). Take out a pizza cutter. Use it to create squares from your dough through a cutting process. Place some of the cherries (1 1/2 tbsp. of them) on the  center of the square. Place your fingers in water. Rub an amount of water extending directly over  two adjoining sides of each square. Turn the dough (which has now been turned into squares) into a triangle shape. Do this through a folding process. Follow these steps again for the 2nd disk of dough.  Transfer your pastries to a baking sheet (which should be greased). Put them in the oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the pastries are completely browned. Allow them to cool before serving; use a cooling rack if necessary. Serve and enjoy! ",
