If the stone is not mounted, you can easily see these layers by immersing it in water and viewing from the side. It's more difficult to see this in a mounted stone, but you can try examining the area around the girdle for odd color changes."

          "headline":"View the emerald through a dichroscope.",
          "description":"Some gemstones appear different colors from different directions, but you'll need a cheap tool called a dichroscope to make this obvious. Hold the gemstone very close to one end of the dichroscope while you look through the viewing window. The gemstone must be illuminated by a strong, diffuse light source as white as possible, such as an overcast sky. Rotate the gemstone and the dichroscope to view it from all directions. Real emeralds are dichroic, appearing blue-green from one angle and a slightly yellow green from another. Strong dichroism (two very distinct colors) is a sign of a high quality emerald. It is possible to get unusual results due to an internal reflection off a facet, due to properties of fluorescent light, or due to light reaching the viewing window without passing through the gemstone. Use this along with other approaches, not as a single, definitive test."

If the price tag seems suspiciously low, you are probably looking at glass or crystal, not emeralds. Synthetic emeralds are much cheaper than natural emeralds, but not as cheap as most other synthetic gems. $75 USD per carat is a ballpark figure for small, synthetic emeralds.
