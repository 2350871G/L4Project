      "description":"While every type of bamboo differs, and a local garden center can give gardeners more specific guidance, most bamboo like lots of water and well-drained soil. Pay attention to the plant. If the leaves start to curl, the bamboo needs more water. Pot or root bound bamboo can develop such a dense root system within a container that the root system can actually be hydrophobic or water resistant. If these root balls are watered with a traditional garden hose the water simply bounces off. The solution to this problem is to water your new bamboo SLOWLY with a trickle for several minutes each. Micro irrigation also works particularly well for all species of bamboo, and can speed up the bamboo growth cycle by as much as 1/3."
