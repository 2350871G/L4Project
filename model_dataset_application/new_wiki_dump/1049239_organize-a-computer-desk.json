      "description":"Sort all the items you use every day into one basket, and all the items you use less frequently into the next basket. Pile any papers scattered on your desk into the third basket for later sorting. Anything you come across that you know you won't actually use--including that extra calculator you've had hanging around, or extra pencils and pens that are just clutter--goes in the fourth box. Clean out all your desk drawers and cubbies, too. Everything goes into one of the boxes. Any trash you find goes straight to the trash can, of course."

      "headline":"Designate a specific place for every item that you use on a daily basis.",
      "description":"Ideally, even day-use items should have a designated drawer, cubby or storage bin, leaving your desktop as clear as possible. Some items you might use every day and want quick access to include pens, pencils, paperclips or binder clips, a stapler, a calculator and a receipt book. Label a sticky note with the name of each daily-use item, then place the sticky note on the item's home. For example, if you decide to keep your stapler in the upper right-hand drawer, put a sticky note with the word \"STAPLER\" on the front of that drawer. Keeping your desk organized isn't just about designating a home for each item, it's also about training yourself to associate each item with its new home and leave it there at the end of the day. You can use a label maker to make more permanent labels, if you find they help, or remove the sticky notes once you're used to storing the daily-use items in their proper places."

If it can't hold your less-frequent-use items comfortably, store items you use less than once a week in a small chest, box or basket near the desk."

This is not a storage station; papers should be stored in a filing cabinet or in filing boxes, not on your desk. Incoming papers and mail go directly into the \"To Read\" part of your system.
