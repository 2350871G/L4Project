Just let it sit without its cap for a few days so it can dry out and become more tacky. Don't try this with a new glue stick that's still spreadable. The sticky tack will be too sticky, and it could glue your pictures to the wall instead of temporarily adhering them there, like sticky tack does. To quickly dry out a glue stick, remove the glue from the plastic stick and put it in an oven-safe container. Cook it in the oven at a very low temperature for an hour or so, until it's dry enough that it doesn't feel sticky to the touch. Be careful when you're handling the hot pan and glue."

This will help it dry out a little more and create the right texture for sticky tack. If it's not quite dry, sprinkle a little baby powder onto the glue ball and work it in. The powder will absorb the remaining moisture."

Add a few drops of color, then roll and stretch the glue ball to mix the color in. Keep adding more color and mixing it in until you're happy with the way it looks. If you're concerned that the sticky tack could leave marks on your pictures, you don't have to add color. Just use the sticky tack as is. It'll work just as well!"
