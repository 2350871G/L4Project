Toss in a few cloves of garlic and fry them for a few minutes. When the garlic aroma is strong and the cloves are starting to brown, toss in a heaping handful of (chopped but unblanched) nettles.

For instance, try this easy garnish recipe that's great for steaks or other pieces of meat:\nBlanch or saut\u00e9 nettles (as above) to remove the stings. Season warm nettles with butter, salt, and pepper. Toss the wilted nettles on top of a steak for a new spin on a classic dish.

Continue the recipe as normal \u2014 you can add a small amount of extra flour if the dough is too moist.

See below for an easy nettle recipe:\nPulse blanched nettles, walnuts (or pine nuts), olive oil, garlic, and parmesan cheese in food processor. Continue until you reach a smooth, even consistency. Use the pesto as a creamy, decadent sauce that's great for pastas or dipping. One great recipe is available here. You can also substitute blanched nettles for basil in WikiHow's pesto recipe. Pesto will turn brown when exposed to air, but this doesn't make it unsafe to eat as long as you store it in the fridge. To avoid this, cover the pesto with a layer of olive oil to prevent air from touching it."

Sweeten with cream and sugar or drink plain for a zero-calorie treat. This tea won't provide any caffeine, but it's great as a relaxing drink later in the day."

As the plant grows, it will reach three to six feet high within a few months. Look for the following telltale features:\nA thick covering of small, hollow needle-like stingers (careful \u2014 you don't want to touch these). Large, heart-shaped leaves with a serrated (jagged) edge. The leaves are attached to the central stem with small stalks. The narrow ends of the hearts point outward from the central stem. A \"twin\" pattern to the leaves. In other words, one leaf points to 12 o'clock and another at the same level points to 6 o'clock. The next set points to 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock.

Their small, hollow stingers are quite sharp and work by injecting painful chemicals like formic acid into the skin, so you do not want to touch them. The stingers can even penetrate light fabrics, so wear a thick pair of jeans, close-toed shoes (boots are better), and multiple layers on your upper body to protect yourself. Gloves are also a must. Thick, sturdy gardening gloves are best, but even these don't always offer perfect protection, so handle the nettles gently."

Put the severed section carefully into a sturdy canvas or plastic sack. Some experts recommend the top leaves for their more tender texture. If you grab the plant, know that the stingers point from the base of the leaves to the tip, so you're most likely to get stung if you rub against the grain. Some people use the roots for homeopathy/natural medicine, but, for the purposes of this article, we'll focus on the stem and leaves, which are eaten as food."

Don't worry \u2014 the sting causes moderate pain and sometimes itching, but it's not excruciating. While you may be comfortable simply waiting for the sting to subside on its own after a few hours, you can also apply a topical ointment or take a few over-the-counter painkillers to dull the pain. See our article on nettle stings for a variety of DIY sting remedies. If you're in the wilderness without any pain-relieving supplies, you can try making a poultice from jewelweed, which also works well for poison ivy. See this page for more info."

Keep in mind that nettles wilt and shrink when cooked (like spinach), but they tend to be quite filling. Make a clean cut and only harvest about 1/3 of each plant so that they may heal and recover. Try to harvest only about 1/20 of each nettle patch. Harvest from the \"middle\" of the patch. Leave the biggest, best plants and the smallest, weakest ones."
