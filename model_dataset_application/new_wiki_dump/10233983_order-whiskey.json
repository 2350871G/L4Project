Contrary to what some people believe, ice can actually enhance the flavor of whiskey that has an alcohol content of 45% or lower. This is because guaiacol, a molecule found in whiskey, floats to the surface the glass and improves the smell and taste. You should order a whiskey on the rocks if you want to dilute the overpowering flavor of straight whiskey without compromising taste. Too many ice cubes can water the drink down and have an adverse effect on flavor. A large ice cube or ice ball works best."
