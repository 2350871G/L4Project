If you do this on the front of the garment, the fuzzy texture will be visible. If  you work from the back, however, it won\u2019t be. Some embroidery may still have the stabilizer attached to it. Tear this stabilizer away first. Embroidery is thinner in the back of the fabric, which will make it easier for the eraser to cut through."

  "text":" Using an Embroidery Eraser Purchase an embroidery eraser or a stitch eraser. You can find this product online or in a well-stocked fabric store. It looks a little like a pair of trimmers for beards. It is ideal for professional-quality embroidery, such as logos on jackets, shirts, and caps. This product is not recommended for hand-embroidery done with a needle, thread, and an embroidery hoop. Turn the garment or fabric over to reveal the back.

Make sure that you get both the front and the back of the fabric. This process may reveal a few stuck threads or stitches. In this case, use a seam ripper to take them out. Using a Seam Ripper Turn your project over so that you can see the back of the embroidery. If this is an actual garment, you might want to turn it inside-out. Working from the back is important. If you work from the front, you might accidentally nick the fabric, which will be visible in the end. For hand-embroidered items, it is best to put them back into the embroidery hoop. If your embroidery still has the stabilizer attached to the back, you should tear it away before continuing. Cut the stitches with a seam ripper. Decide how many stitches you need to remove first, then slide a seam ripper under those stitches and lift it upwards at an angle to rip through them. The blade inside the hooked part of the seam ripper will cut through the threads. You can use a pair of embroidery or manicure scissors.

If you are working with a multi-layered piece of embroidery, continue with the running stitches and decorative stitches. Finish off with the main stitches last. Fading Stitch Marks Iron the front of the fabric using the appropriate setting. The heat setting on your iron will either be labeled by temperature or by fabric type. Select the setting that best matches your fabric. For example:\nUse a hot setting for cotton or linen, and a cool or warm setting for silk and synthetics. If you are working with cotton, and your iron is labeled by fabric type, choose the \"cotton\" setting. Rub your fingernail horizontally across the stitch marks. Find the holes created by the removed stitches, then scrape your fingernail back-and-forth across them. You only need to do this 2 to 3 times. Work on top of a hard surface, such as a table. You can also use the tip of a spoon. Be gentle if you are working with silk as it may tear easily. Scrape your fingernail vertically across the stitch marks. When you scratched the holes side-to-side, you only closed the vertical threads. Scratching them vertically (top-to-bottom) will tighten up the horizontal threads. Don't worry if the holes don't disappear right away. Press the fabric with an iron, then repeat the process, if needed. Iron the fabric using the appropriate heat setting. Scrape your fingernail horizontally then vertically across the holes. If the holes are still there, repeat the process 1 or 2 more times. Don't worry if they don't completely disappear. You will be repeating the entire process for the back of the fabric, which should take care of the remaining holes. Flip the fabric over and repeat the ironing and scraping process. Press the fabric with an iron, then scrape the holes 2 to 3 times with your fingernail. Go horizontally across the holes first, then vertically. Like with the front, you may have to repeat the steaming and scraping process a few times.",
