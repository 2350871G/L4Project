To wash and cut the fruit:\nPeel the bananas and orange. Leave the bananas whole. Chop the orange into one-inch (2.5-cm) chunks. Wash the raspberries under running water and place them in a strainer to dry off. Repeat with the blueberries, spinach, and strawberries. Cut the stems off the strawberries. Wash the peach and cut it in half to remove the pit. Cut the peach into quarters. Wash the beet and cut off the tail and the stem. Cut the beet into quarters. Peel the pineapple and mango. Cut the fruit from around the core of the pineapple and the pit of the mango. Cut the fruit into one-inch (2.5-cm) chunks."

Place the fruit bunches into separate freezer bags once it\u2019s all divided out. Purple layer: combine half a banana and the blueberries. You can also substitute mixed berries or blackberries. As you portion out the bananas for the different layers, cut them into one-inch (2.5-cm) chunks. Blue layer: one banana and \u00bd cup (82.5 g) of pineapple. You will use the food coloring to turn this blue. Red layer: half a banana, and \u00bc cup each of raspberries (31.25 g) and strawberries (50 g). Magenta layer: half a banana, the beet, and \u00bc cup each of raspberries (31.25 g) and strawberries (50 g). Green layer: one banana, the spinach, and \u00bd cup (82.5 g) of pineapple. For a more vibrant green, add \u00bc of an avocado as well. Yellow layer: one banana and \u00bd cup (82.5 g) of pineapple. Orange layer: half a banana, the peach, the orange, and the mango."

Keep these ingredients cold and in the fridge until you're ready to assemble your smoothie. You can use Greek, regular, coconut, or soy yogurt for the smoothies. Each smoothie color will require \u00bc cup (61 g) of yogurt. Good blending liquids for the smoothies include coconut milk, water, and dairy or non-dairy milk. Each smoothie color will require about 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of liquid."

In the bottom of the blender, pour in \u00bc cup (61 g) of yogurt and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of orange juice. Then add the fruit for the magenta layer, which is banana, beet, raspberries, and strawberries. Always add the liquids to the blender first, as this will prevent air bubbles from forming. When you start up the blender, start on a low speed. As the fruit chunks get smaller, increase the speed until the mixture is smooth and free of chunks. As you blend, add more orange juice if you need to loosen up the fruit. You can also turn off and unplug the blender to stir the smoothie if necessary."

You want about the same quantity of each color per smoothie, which will work out to roughly a one-inch (2.5-cm) layer of each color. To make even and flat layers, pack the smoothie layer down with the spoon. Place the glasses into the freezer until you're ready to add another layer. If you're only making one smoothie, pour the remaining magenta smoothie back into the freezer bag and save it for later. When the blender is empty, rinse it out with warm water so that you don\u2019t mix colors making your next layer."

          "description":"Make the purple layer next by adding the yogurt, juice, and fruit. Repeat using the same process as you did for the magenta layer. When you're ready to pour, remove the glasses from the freezer and spoon in a one-inch (2.5-cm) thick layer (on top of the magenta.) Pack it down and return the cup to the freezer. When you're making the blue layer, don\u2019t forget to add the food coloring, otherwise you'll have another layer of yellow. The food coloring is necessary because blue fruits, such as blueberries, actually turn purple when blended. If you don\u2019t want to use artificial food coloring, you can find natural food coloring, or skip the blue layer."

This will help keep the fruit layers frozen, which will keep the colors from blending together. For each fruit layer:\nAdd the yogurt and orange juice first. Blend the mixture until smooth, adding more liquid if necessary. Remove the glasses from the freezer and spoon in a one-inch layer of smoothie on top of the previous layer. Return the glasses to the freezer until you add the next layer. Place any unused smoothie back into the freezer. Rinse out the blender."
