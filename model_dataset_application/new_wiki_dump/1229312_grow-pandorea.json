To amend your soil, dig up the top 6 inches (15 cm) of soil and mix in a light layer of sand, compost, or dead leaves. If you\u2019re planting pandorea in a container, choose a loamy soil so it has good drainage. Pandorea does well in acidic, neutral, and alkaline soil."

Nematodes are notoriously difficult to eradicate, but you may be able to control the problem with a variety of techniques. Amend the soil by adding organic material like manure and compost to limit the damage done by the nematodes. You can also apply bionematicide on a regular basis to paralyze the nematode eggs so they don\u2019t hatch. Use solarization to treat the soil after relocating the plant.
