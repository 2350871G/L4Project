          "description":"You can use metal bottle caps from glass beer and soda bottles, or you can buy some from the craft store. If you are buying bottle caps from a craft store, note that some have holes punched into the edges. You can use these holes to turn them into jewelry. Many of the craft store bottle caps come painted or with flared edges. These can often give you a nicer finish. If you are recycling real bottle caps, there may be a rubber seal on the inside. Be sure to peel this away first."

Maps, scrapbooking paper, and initials work great for this. If you wish to seal your image later on with 3D crystal lacquer, use a laser printer. Images printed with an ink jet printer will blur."

Check the bottle or tube of glue for more precise drying times. Don't get impatient. If you move onto the next step too soon, the epoxy sticker may not adhere properly. If you are using 3D lacquer, it may not set."

You can also flood the bottle cap with 3D crystal lacquer, which you can find in the adhesive or jewelry section of an arts and crafts store. If you are using 3D crystal lacquer, watch out for air bubbles. If you see any, pop them with a pin or toothpick. If you are using 3D crystal lacquer, be careful of any punched holes that might be in the sides of the bottle cap, or the lacquer will leak out."

A silver rare earth or neodymium magnet is highly recommended for this due to its strength; you can find them online and in arts and crafts stores. If you are using 3D crystal lacquer, you will need to wait up to 24 hours for it to set first."

Glue a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) acrylic gem inside the bottle cap instead of using an image and 3D crystal lacquer. Stir a sprinkle of extra-fine glitter into the crystal lacquer before it sets.
