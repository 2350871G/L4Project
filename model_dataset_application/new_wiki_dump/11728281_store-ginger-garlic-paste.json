Sprinkle the salt and pour the oil into the paste before blending it again to be sure it\u2019s thoroughly combined.

But if you\u2019d rather keep your paste from changing color, add 1  tsp (4.9 ml) or so of white vinegar to the paste. Mix it with a spoon or food processor to be sure it\u2019s well combined. The vinegar will help preserve the taste too. You can use any type of vinegar, but white vinegar is best so it doesn't alter the taste or color too much."
