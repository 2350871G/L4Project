Mark out an even 8\u2019x8\u2019 square where you want the gazebo to go and then dig holes for the posts using a post hole digger. Level the posts in the holes such that 8\u2019 is above ground and the inside corners are 8\u2019 apart. Then, use quick cement to anchor them, making sure that they remain straight and of equal height. The quick cement should fill \u2154 of the hole around the post and the remainder can be covered with dirt after it sets."

The beams will need to be placed perpendicular to the posts, 2 to each side, 2\" from the top and bottom respectively (although the distance may need to be adjusted, read full instructions). Secure the beams with two large bolts, placed through the post and into the center of each beam. This is definitely a two or three person job. At least one person will need to hold the beam while the other attaches the bolts. You may have to pre-drill the bolt holes. The distance between the two beams will be dependent on whether or not you add windows, and what the dimensions of those windows are if you choose to add them. If adding windows, measure their height, add 1.5\u201d, and make this the distance between the bracing beams."

Then, create a frame for the window using 1x4s. The height should be the same as the window and distance between the bracing beams (accounting for the width of the frame itself). Nail the frame into position, fit the window in, and set it in place by placing nails on either side. The nails should stick up by a quarter of an inch. Fit them as close as possible to the window itself so that the window won\u2019t move. Three or four for each side of the window is probably a good enough number.

Holding the roof in place, bolt it into the corner posts at each end. Make sure your bolts aren\u2019t too long: you want them to go in but not pop through the other side of the post. Insert your windows. You can also add windows into the triangles (smaller than the windows in the walls).

You can paint the entire wood structure whatever color you want to. Paint it to match your house or paint it a bold color to make it a backyard accent piece. Make sure the paint you use is appropriate for outdoor use. Paint can additionally protect the wood, prolonging the life of your structure. Add a roof covering.
