Look at how the photo panels are laid out and choose the style that best fits with your images. Popular layouts include squares, Facebook cover photos, circles, and standard photo sizes. Many collage sites will allow you to add as many photos as you want to your collage, but they won\u2019t look as clear when you add more. If you want a simple, easy to follow collage, aim to use less than 5 photos. You can always change the size and shape later on, but it will make you lose your previous work unless you save it."

Use a neutral color, like white or black, if you don\u2019t want the background as noticeable. Otherwise, select a color similar to the color in your photos to help it blend in. Some collage editors allow you to completely remove the background so the edges of your photos are touching.
