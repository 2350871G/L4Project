  "text":" Planning Your Build Figure out what kind of lifestyle you want to live. Your needs for mobility, stability and space will determine the type of tiny house you will be seeking to develop. Consider the following:\nIf you intend to move a lot, then a trailer-based home is probably a good choice. If you think you'll maybe move once or twice, then you can use a bigger trailer base for your house a rent a truck to move it for you when the time comes. Build onto the tiny house. You also have the option of building extensions to the main house, such as a deck or rooftop patio. If you have a spot to build on, then you can do normal construction on a spot of land (this tends to be more expensive and permanent). Determine what needs your home must meet. Sit down and make a list of all the things you want in your home. Of course, this is a tiny house, so you need to focus on the necessities, as there isn't any room for a lot of stuff.

Choose a location with accessibility to water and electricity. If this is not possible find a way to come up with alternatives. For example, many people prefer to use solar power and collect rain as part of the tiny house philosophy. Creating a First Draft of the House Map out all the things you want in your house. As you do so, keep in mind the exact amount of space you have to work with. It will always be less than you expect, so don't be surprised if you have to let go of some dream ideas but see this as an opportunity to be inventive rather than giving up on everything.

This step works best by making an electronic floor plan of the house, or you can also make a actual model by hand so that you get a good sense of how it will look in your hands. Scale the design so that the dimensions of your model will be accurate when building the house. A key aspect of this step is to build the house around the appliances you want. Go online and find the appliances that you will buy and go to the specs of the product. There will be dimensions for you to include in your floor plan/model. Making a Budget Work out the budget by concentrating on the main elements involved. These are appliances, labour, building materials and tools. Usually to build the house with all the desirable (kitchen, trailer, siding, etc. ), an average cost is about $35,000 for a 24 ft trailer house. Keep in mind that the smaller the trailer, the cheaper the build. And, if you want fancier things and bigger size, the tiny house can cost up to $100,000. Work out the appliance budget. With the appliances that you have selected in your floor plans as a base, include how much you can spend immediately. Then work out how much you can spend over time (that is, how much you can deduct from your paycheck towards the build). Determine what you can do yourself. Then include the amount of labour that you can put in for things you can do yourself. Figure out the cost of labour for professionals (i.e. plumber, electrician, builders). Cost the tools you will need for your build. Renting the tools when necessary is one way to go so you don't have to put too much money into tools that you will not use again. For some basic tools it might be a better idea to just buy and own them if you don't already have them.This list provides a rundown of the tools you'll likely need:Air compressor \u2013 Drives air powered tools like framing nailers and paint sprayers.

A typical list of materials that you will need in your tiny house. The amount of each that you will need depends on your build, and the cost will therefore reflect what type of tiny house you're building. Here are standard materials needed:\nTrailer (varies in the size and length\nwood for floors, walls, ceiling, and interior structures\nInstallation for the walls, floor and ceiling (recommend Roxul - fire and water resistant)\nClass D tires for the trailer\nTypical house siding\nTypical shingles for roof\nDrywall\nDoors and windows\nCabinets and storage closets (many can be built from reclaimed wood if feasible)\nToilet (composting, RV toilet, or a actual functioning toilet)\nShower (typically small standing shower is used, a small tub can be added with creativity)\nSinks (kitchen, and bathroom)\nCounter-tops\nPlenty of screws, braces, and nails\nPipes for plumbing and propane lines for heating and water lines\nElectrical circuit wiring, outlets, switches, and breakers\nTyvek wrapping for protection (or similar suited to your area)\nHeating system\nRegular appliances as selected by you\nMetal sheeting for flashing the trailer base (galvanized for durability). Include solar power elements, as needed. If solar panels are going to be added, then you'll need the following as well: A charge controller, deep cycle batteries, and inverter to store charge and convert from DC to AC power. Constructing Your Tiny House Level the trailer using jacks for the trailer. This step is important to do properly or your house will be tilted. Build a frame on the trailer that your house will be built. Anchor the frame to the trailer so that your house does not slide off the trailer during transport keep in mind the weight distribution so that your house does not tip over. Add galvanized sheet metal to flash the bottom of the trailer. This helps protect the home from rodents, water, and other elements from the bottom. Put a floor frame on top. Add the insulation (Roxul) for more protection. Install the sub floor on top.  Build the walls as you had designed in your floor plans. Leave room for the windows and doors, as well as putting in the studs, and weight barring headers. The headers are one of the aspects that are against building code, but are necessary for a tiny house, as every wall is a weight bearing wall. You must ensure that everything is perfectly squared. Double check that the windows and door fit in the spaces you made for them. Do this before you put the walls up. At this point you might want to move anything inside the house that will not fit through the door depending on the design. Sheath the walls while they are still down. Then raise the walls (with help, for safety reasons). Make sure that the walls are perfectly squared with the floor and other walls. Secure the walls to the trailer with anchors.  Make sure that walls are perfectly parallel with each other before installing the rafters. Apply a spring brace to secure the walls and make them perfectly straight while installing the rafter\nDouble check the distance between the walls at the top for a good cut. Construct the trusses per the plans that you made. Ensure that the height is under 13.5 ft to stay street legal (this may vary between countries, so check with the road authorities first). Begin the sheathing process. Cut out the boards and glue the truss edges. Use clips to secure the sheets of wood into place and secure with nail/screws Apply the Tyvek covering for more protection on the sheathing boards.  Install the reflection barrier followed by the furring strips and shingles.  Make sure that door and window holes were cut in the walls that were put up.  Put Tyvek wrap outside the house for protection  Tuck the Tyvek wrapping into the window cut outs. Begin applying flash tape to the window sills to prevent water and heat from entering. Install the windows and secure with a couple screws along the side. Then test the functionality. Apply flashing tape to the outside of the window to insure it is sealed. Leave the bottom unsealed for water drainage, just in case. For the doors, do the same thing as windows and flash the doorway then start installing the door frame. Install the door. This can be made or purchased. Install locks and door knobs.  Begin the siding process by taping the Tyvek seams and installing the furring strips. Paint both sides of the siding before putting up, to prevent rusting. Hang the siding with a nail gun or as the product describes.  End the work on the outside by installing fascia boards and a drip edge.  Creating the Interior of the Tiny House Install a lofted platform at an optimal height for the sleeping area. This is a common practice in a tiny house. It will also need a ladder or staircase to reach the loft area. Get electrical and plumbing installed by a professional at this point. Do not do this yourself unless you are a professional in these fields. Make sure you instruct the professional on where you want your outlets, lights and sockets for your tiny house to accommodate the floor plan, such as gas lines for the propane to the stove/oven or water lines to the water heater and shower. Put in the smoke and CO alarms at the same time. Consider the power usage or your appliances and adjust accordingly. Begin insulating the home from the inside. Make sure to put foam in the edges so that it is completely sealed. Make sure that all materials are not affected by the foam, as some do react and that is not a good outcome. Install the major fixtures now. This includes the heater, shower, toilet, sink, and water heater (preferably tankless). The heater weight should be considered in conjunction with the weight of the tiny house as a whole, and a safety zone and materials placed around it. Install the desired flooring. For example, you could use hardwood in the living area and light tiles in the kitchen and bathroom areas. Splashbacks can also be used. Install drywall and/or wall panels.  Construct the cabinets and counter tops for the kitchen. It is great if you can use recycled wood for these purposes. Include hookups and openings for the oven, fridge, and sink, etc. Construct and install the bathroom vanity and storage. Install vents and the toilet. Build in the storage units as per the initial design. You may also realize other possible storage options, so remain flexible and open to relevant changes. Put in bulbs and outlet covers.  Decorate as desired. Your tiny house is complete. Now you can move in and enjoy your own space.",
