Using a tape measure, find the distance between your vent hood\u2019s cap extension and the dryer\u2019s exhaust vent. Write down the measurement to use later. Put tape around the area of hose you need to cut. Set your vent hose on a smooth surface and extend it if necessary.

Cutting and Fashioning a Rigid Vent Hose Measure the length between your dryer and vent hood. Run a tape measure between your dryer\u2019s exhaust vent and the vent hood. Measure the path as if the hose were already assembled to account for any curves or bends. Record the measurement for later reference. Set your hose on a firm surface.

Vent hoses have small seams along the edges so you can easily assemble them. To do so, simply press the seams against each other until they snap  together, then secure them by pressing down on the hose. Repeat this for the entire length of the vent piece. Connecting the Rigid Hose to the Dryer and Vent Hood Connect your hose pieces together if necessary.

If you\u2019re using elbow pieces, slide the crimped end of one elbow piece into the hose. If you\u2019re attaching multiple hose segments together, combine them using an aluminium duct connector.

When the dryer vent hose is fully attached, make sure all the seams are covered with foil tape. Then, press the dryer vent to the wall and hold it down using pipe straps and simple screws. For safety, use one pipe strap for every 6 to 8 in (15 to 20 cm) of hose. Adding a New Vent Hood if Necessary Find a good spot to install the hood. Look around the room where you keep your dryer and search for a spot as close to the dryer\u2019s exhaust port as possible. Select a spot made from material that you can cut through, like plaster, wood, vinyl, or aluminum. Remember to check both sides of the wall to make sure there are no obstructions on either end.

If you\u2019re drilling through stucco or brick veneer, make sure to use a hammer drill fitted with a masonry bit. Make a template on the wall by tracing the vent hood. Once you\u2019re set on a location, place the pipe portion of your vent hood over the center of the test hole and trace the outside using a pencil. Make sure to repeat this process on both the inside and outside of your house. Remove stucco and brick veneer coverings using a hammer and chisel.
