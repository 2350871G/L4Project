Don't grip the avocado with your fingertips. If you squeeze too hard, you can bruise the flesh. Unripe avocados will feel hard, and won't give at all. You can also pull away the stem at the top of the avocado. If it is bright green underneath, the avocado is ripe. Sometimes unripe avocados are very dark. Although color can be an indication of ripeness, test for softness to be sure."
