Be sure to use warm water when you dampen the washrag. If this doesn\u2019t seem to work, you can add a few drops of white vinegar to the damp washcloth to give it a more powerful cleaning."

You can do this outside with a garden hose, or carefully in the kitchen sink or shower. Flush the hose several times, or until the water runs clear once it filters out of the hose attachment. You should also clean out any debris that has lodged itself in the bristles of the hose."
