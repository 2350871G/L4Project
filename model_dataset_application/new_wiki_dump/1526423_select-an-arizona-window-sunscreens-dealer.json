      "description":"This might go without saying. Yet sometimes consumers go with the first company whose name they pull out of the phone book. Shop around and compare prices. Don't assume that all AZ window sunscreens retailers are the same. By the same token, make sure you understand exactly what you'll get for the price you'll pay. If one retailer is significantly cheaper than another, find out why. It's not worth saving a few dollars if the product quality is poor."

      "headline":"Ask questions.",
      "description":"Arming yourself with information will help you make the best decision. Some basic things to ask are: \nWhat are your products made of? * Do your prices include installation? How long is your product and workmanship guaranteed for? How long will it take to get my order? Do I have to pay up front or make just a down payment? The more information you have before you buy, the more intelligent a choice you'll be able to make."

      "headline":"Ask for quotes.",
      "description":"Once you've narrowed down your choices to a couple of AZ window sunscreens dealers, ask for a custom quote. Naturally your final cost will depend upon how many windows you need coverings for. Your AZ window sunscreens retailer should be eager to supply you with this information. If you get quotes from multiple companies, compare them. If one is significantly higher/lower than another, it's time to ask more questions."
