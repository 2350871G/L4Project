If you have a very lightweight wreath\u2014one made primarily of plastic or fabric, for instance\u2014any decent suction cup hook will probably do. For bigger wreaths, though, weigh them before suction cup shopping. Stand on a scale holding the wreath, and then without the wreath, and subtract the difference to get the wreath's weight."

Many of them are rated to hold 10 pounds (4.5 kg), which should be plenty strong for most wreaths. For glass storm doors, you place the plain disc on the inside of the glass and the hooked disc on the outside, and their magnetic attraction holds them in place. If you're hanging your wreath from a metal part of a door, you'll only need to use the disc with the hook. It'll stick to the door just like a really strong fridge magnet!"

To prevent this, create magnet pads out of a lightweight fabric to sandwich between the magnets and your door. To make magnet pads, trace the circular outline of the magnets on a thin fabric, like an old t-shirt. Then, simply cut out the circles. You can also stick the circles to the magnets with a small piece of double-sided tape to make things a bit easier."

Then, use your other hand to bring the other magnet into position on the other side of the glass. The magnets are strongly attracted to each other, so make sure you don't pinch your skin between them during application. Use your fingertips to grip around the circumference of the discs. Once the magnets are stuck together, you can hang your wreath right away."

Most brands of removable hooks use an adhesive strip that releases when you stretch it out. No matter the brand you choose, pick a hook with an adhesive that's intended for outdoor use, and check the weight rating to make sure it can hold up your wreath. Adhesive hooks come in a wide array of sizes and weight ratings, and there are specific versions meant for application outdoors. There are also hooks with non-removable adhesives, so make sure you choose the right type! Follow the package instructions for surface preparation. Often, you'll be advised to clean the surface (e.g., your storm door window) with a typical home cleaner, then go over the area with a clean rag dampened with rubbing alcohol. Let the glass dry after using both the cleaner and the rubbing alcohol. Mark the spot where you want to place the hook. Yes, the adhesive hook is removable, but it's easiest to stick it in the right spot the first time. If you're applying it to a glass door, stick a small piece of masking tape on the inside of the glass that corresponds to the spot where the hook will go on the outside of the glass. If you're applying it to metal, use colored chalk to make a very small dot in the desired position. Do this after cleaning the area. Stick the adhesive strip and hook to the door as directed. For instance, you may be directed as follows: peel the backing off one side of the adhesive; stick it to the plastic insert for the hook; peel off the other adhesive backing, and stick the plastic insert to the door by pressing firmly; leave the insert in place for the listed period of time; slide the plastic hook over the plastic insert.

When it comes time to remove the hook, you'll slide off the hook cover, then pull straight down on the tab attached to the adhesive strip. Once you've stretched the strip enough, it will let go of its grip to your storm door. Hanging Between the Doors Don't hang a live wreath between your main and storm doors. You might think a live wreath\u2014like a holiday wreath made from evergreen branches\u2014will last longer if it's protected from the elements by being behind your glass storm door.
