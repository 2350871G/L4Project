          "description":"Raspberries come in three different colors: red, yellow, and black. Some variants of black have more of a purplish-black hue. Each color has a different general flavor profile and level of hardiness. In most cases, you'll find that red and yellow raspberries are the sweetest colors, especially compared to black ones, which have a deeper, richer flavor. Red raspberries may want to be prioritized for beginning growers. Generally, these can be counted on to be the most hearty of the three colors. Black raspberries are the most difficult of the three colors to maintain. These are more susceptible to disease and environmental changes."

Ever-bearers, on the other hand, produce one harvest in summer and another in the fall. Popular summer-bearers:\nLatham (round, dark red fruit)\nMeeker (deep red, extremely sweet, high sugar content)\nWillamette (firm and slightly tart)\nBrandywine (large, purplish-black fruit)\nBlack Hawk (deep black, juicy berry)\n\n\nPopular ever-bearers:\nAmity (medium-sized, dark red, firm, and fragrant)\nFall Gold (golden yellow color, very sweet)\nSeptember (tart, juicy, with medium sized fruit)\nHeritage (rich in flavor, firm, large fruit size)"

By doing so, you can create an ongoing harvest so you can have fresh raspberries throughout the growing season. One possible combination could be mixing Algonquin (ever-bearing) with Autumn Bliss (midsummer-bearing).

Your hardiness zone can be looked up on the USDA website. The zones that plants are best suited for are usually listed with their care information. For the best results in your plants, only choose plants rated for your zone. In northern areas, you should use hardier, more cold-tolerant varieties of raspberry, like Boyne, Nova, and Nordic. In southern climates, choose raspberries that can withstand high heat and potential dryness, like Dorman Red, Bababerry, and Southland varieties."

For raspberries, aim to expose them to as much light as possible. Warm sunshine has a tendency to improve the quality of raspberry fruit, making it juicier and more flavorful. Fruit with poor light might turn out stunted and shriveled. You may have to move garden or yard items that block the sun to your raspberries. Prune back trees or bushes that could block the sun."

Set up a wind block for plants by stringing a sheet or tarp between posts. Provide additional support for your berries by stringing two guidelines between two row-end T-trellises or V-trellises. Each line should be separated by 3\u00bd ft (1.1 m) to create a space for the berries to grow, and should be about 3\u00bd ft high."

Black and purple varieties should be kept 3 ft (.91 m) from other same-row plants. Distance between rows should be between 6 and 24 in (15.2 and 61 cm). Spacing your plants adequately will help them receive the most sunlight possible, which will encourage the best possible harvest."

          "description":"Rich, well-draining, sandy loam soil will provide the best growing conditions for your raspberries. Improve your soil quality by using plant formulated soil and mixing in compost with it. Avoid planting in low-lying areas where water may collect after a heavy rain. Standing water can contribute to mildew, mold, root rot, and other kinds of plant disease. Although raspberries fare poorly in standing water or when overwatered, make sure water is easily available. Water supply is especially important during dry times of the season. Refrain from planting raspberries in soil previously used for bramble berries, tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, eggplants, or roses. These can leave behind diseases. Destroy any wild growing raspberries or blackberries within about 600 ft (183 m) of those you plant. Wild berries can also transmit diseases to your healthy berries."

You can purchase pH testing kits at your local nursery or home center, but you might also check out other methods as well. You should be able to find soil pH testing forms, bags, and instructions at your local agricultural extension office as well. In most cases, you can easily lower the pH level of your soil by mixing granular sulfur with it. This is available at most nurseries and home centers."

Space seeds one inch apart and then use your finger to push them about an inch (2.5 cm) into the ground. Cover seeds with a thin layer of loose soil/sand and store them in a dim, cool place indoors. Keep the seeds lightly moist with a spray bottle. Place the seeds outside in partial sunlight when temperatures reach at least 60\u00baF (15.6\u00baC).
