      "description":"Most MMORPG games are pay-to-play, meaning you have to pay a monthly fee, while some are free and cost nothing. Usually the free versions are limited, meaning you can't use all the features. So find a game you want to get into, and read on. However, if you want to try to be the best player in the game, sign up to be a beta tester, because when the game first comes out, you'll be the first to play. This means you'll be able to play longer than anyone else (besides the others that signed up for it of course). When you choose a game, try it out. You never know if you'll like it or not."
