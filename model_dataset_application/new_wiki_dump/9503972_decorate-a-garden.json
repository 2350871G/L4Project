          "headline":"Provide some functional seating.",
          "description":"Set out a stone or wrought iron bench where you can rest your legs after an afternoon of yard work or post up to enjoy some peace and quiet. Fill out open spaces with Adirondack chairs for gazing off at the horizon, or something more imaginative, like weatherproofed tree stumps configured in a ring like a campfire. Situate your seating at sensible points throughout your garden. If it\u2019s too close, it may crowd your home, whereas remote perches can seem like an afterthought. Tuck a bench into an alcove or behind a row of large flowering plants for a surprise hideaway that\u2019s just out of view."

        {
          "headline":"Design a cozy lounging area.",
          "description":"Treat your garden like another room in your home, taking cues from your interior decor. You might group together a sofa, a couple oversized chairs and ottomans, or even a chaise lounge to make a gathering place that\u2019s comfortable and cohesive. Reserve the centermost section for an all-weather coffee table to hold some light reading or a pitcher of lemonade. Invest in durable outdoor furniture that can withstand exposure to sunlight, extremes in temperature, and other harsh weather conditions. Teak, pine, cedar, and wicker are all attractive woods that are hard-wearing and naturally water resistant."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Create a transition with your porch or patio.",
          "description":"If your garden butts up against a sitting room with a view of the outdoors, bridge the gap by keeping the furniture and other accessories consistent between the two. For example, you could have matching furniture sets on either side of the screen door or carry over a decorative theme from one area to the next. Leave the outer door open when you have company so your guests can pass back and forth from inside to outside at will."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Hang a rustic tire swing.",
          "description":"This throwback to childhood is a seating solution and aesthetic aid in one. Just take an old tire, fasten it to a length of rope, and loop it over a sturdy branch. It's sure to be a beloved fixture in your garden, even if no one ever sits in it. If the black tire looks out of place, try painting it a quaint color, like powder blue or pastel yellow, so that it blends better with its environment. Make your tire swing part of the garden itself by filling the hollow rim with potting soil and converting it to an improvised planter."

          "description":"Pull up that ugly chain link or prefab slat fence and put in a new one made from whitewashed boards, molded concrete, or wrought iron. These types of rugged materials are perfect for creating a bit of pleasant contrast. The result will be a blend of bohemian and contemporary that\u2019s virtually timeless. Design and construct a fence to your own specifications yourself, or call a contractor to have it done professionally. Be prepared to pay $1,500-3,000 USD for installation, depending on your preferred materials and the amount of ground you have to cover. Fences are also useful for keeping out scavenging animals and protecting against wind and water erosion. Go with a privacy fence 6 feet (1.8 m) in height or taller to preserve the peaceful seclusion of your garden."

Draw inspiration from antique Greek sculpture or keep things uniquely with vivid modern art installations. Even a simple piece of yard art like a gazing globe or sundial can add some much-needed flair. You can find affordable premade concrete statues and other accessories at most gardening stores."

These playful setups have become increasingly popular among homeowners with limited garden space. You can find them online or make your own."

Since these pieces command so much attention, they\u2019re best saved for the central part of your garden or perhaps an outlying corner that you\u2019re particularly proud of. Putting in a self-recycling fountain may require you to modify your underground plumbing. These types of water fixtures tend to attract small animals, which could present a problem if you use your garden for growing vegetables."

          "description":"Pick out some broad, flat stones and use them to direct foot traffic through a winding garden path. You can simply collect these yourself, or purchase them to the exact size and specifications that you\u2019re looking for. Be sure to arrange the stones appropriately so they each sit at a natural walking distance. Alternating between darker and lighter colored stones can offer more visual depth. You could also lay down wooden planks in place of stones for a more enchanting woodsy feel."

        {
          "headline":"Upgrade your outdoor lighting.",
          "description":"As an alternative to conventional landscape lighting, try hanging multicolored string lights or oriental paper lanterns. Set up soft-glowing spotlights to showcase impressive sculptures or floral arrangements, or place tea lights between plants and in open area to mimic fireflies. Be careful if you\u2019re using real candles for illumination. They can become a fire hazard if you forget about them or kick one over by accident. If you have a table in the lounging area you set up, you could also make a tabletop fire bowl to set on top of it for another cozy light source."

Try walling off individual plots with stacked stones or use sawed timber to contain mounds of mulch. If you\u2019ve got a steady hand and a little patience, you could even plant low shrubs around the perimeter of your flower beds to limit the number of foreign materials you bring into your garden. Knee-high trellises or a series of connected stakes will help prevent those on foot from trampling new growth that\u2019s just beginning to spring up.

Consider hanging smaller planters to make the most of the ground space you have available. Get creative and experiment with a variety of found and modified objects.
