This way, you fill fill the space between the top of your cabinet and the ceiling without creating clutter. For example:\nIf you have a lot of space, try a few large baskets or bulky vases. If you don't have a lot of space, try decorative plates or small statues."

          "description":"The top of a cabinet is a perfect place to display collections, such as dishes, statues, or candlesticks. Make sure that they go together, however. For example, you could display all blue china dishes, wooden candlesticks, garden gnome statues, or wooden cutouts of roosters. Match the theme to your kitchen. If you have a Mexican-themed kitchen, colorful Mexican dishes would look a lot better than oriental vases."

          "description":"If your kitchen has a simple color scheme, such as white and blue, you pick out white and blue items. If your kitchen has a more complex color scheme, pick out one color, and stick with it. If your kitchen has a certain color that pops, consider using that for your items. It'll help tie everything together. If you don't have a lot of space, choose a subtle color without a lot of contrast so it doesn't make things look crowded."

          "description":"This goes against many of the established rules for cabinet decorating, but it's one that could give you a surprising result. Try placing smooth and rough textured items next to each other, such as glass vases and hand-woven baskets. Vary the sizes of your items. Try pairing curved items with angular items."

Because of how inconvenient it is to get to the top of the cabinet, it would be best to choose items you seldom use for this. You can also put decorative glass canisters up there and store things in them or fill them with lights. Keep in mind that you'll need to dust these items frequently since the area above kitchen cabinets is more prone to dust. Avoid storing anything up there that you don't want to get dusty."

If you try to crowd too much, your cabinets will look like storage space, rather than a display for a treasured collection. You want each item to shine. Putting up too many items will also make the cabinet more difficult to dust. The fewer items you use, the less work you will have to do. Remember that you don't need to fill all of the space. A couple of strategically placed items can still have a dramatic effect."

Try spacing some items further apart and others closer together for a more creative touch. This works especially well if you are going to be mixing and matching the items."

          "description":"This will help pull the gaze in and lead it around. Don't place it dead-center, as this will put too much focus on the item. Once you have the item placed, arrange your other items to either side of it. An item that's both big and bold would work great for this. For example:\nIf you collect platters, use your largest, most colorful platter as the focal point. If you have vases and they are all the same size, fill your favorite one with fake flowers or branches, and use that. If you don't have much space, group together three items to create a unique composition."

          "description":"You can arrange the items so that they get smaller the closer they get to the side edges. Alternatively, you can alternate sizes for a mix-and-match feel. Don't be afraid to place smaller items in front of larger ones, but make sure that the items in the back are still visible. Another option would be to place some items closer to the wall and others further away from it. Avoid placing anything too close to the edge, especially if it can fall."

Fill them with items you want to keep out of sight in the kitchen, then tuck them into place. Make sure that the baskets match your kitchen, however! Great items to store include linens, candles, baking molds, cookie cutters, and kitchen gadgets you rarely use. Another alternative would be to install a wine rack, then store your vintages there. Even if you don't have a wine rack, you can still put full or empty wine bottles above your kitchen cabinets for decoration and storage."

Slide it onto a tension rod, then install the rod above the cabinet, a few inches/centimeters from the ceiling. This is a great option if you want to use the space above the cabinet for storage. Make sure that the curtain matches the colors and patterns of the other items in your kitchen.

You can fill this space with a string of lights. Lights will give your kitchen a high-end feel, and you'll have more mood-lighting options. Use lights on a white wire for white cabinets, otherwise stick with silver/clear. Secure the lights to the cabinets with clear or metal hooks. You can use plug-in or battery-operated lights."

If you have more space above your cabinet, you can drape a larger, heavier garland over it instead. Secure skinny garlands to the top edge of the cabinet with hooks. Make sure that they don't interfere with the doors, however! Keep in mind that garland will collect a lot of dust, so you'll need to regularly clean it. Don't overdo it on the garland or you could make your kitchen appear outdated. Stick with a light, simple strand."

You can create your own message using individual letters, or you can buy an entire word or phrase (i.e. : Eat, Drink, Live, Laugh, Love, etc. ), and use that instead. Blank, wooden letters are a great option because you can paint or decoupage them to match your kitchen. You can also get metal letters for an industrial, rustic look. A great alternative would be to set up a wooden plaque painted with chalkboard paint. You can write your own message and change it as you see fit."
