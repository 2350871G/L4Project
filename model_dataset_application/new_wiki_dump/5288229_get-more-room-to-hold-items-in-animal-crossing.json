Just tap the letter icon, and your letters will pop up. If you do not have any letters, then you will need to buy some. If you do already have a complete set of letters (there are ten slots), feel free to skip to Step 4."

      "description":"Visit Nook\u2019s shop on Main Street. Every day, there will be some paper for sale. The packs of paper always cost 160 bells, so you should be able to afford it. Each pack contains four pieces of paper, which translate to four letters. If you\u2019re starting with no letters in your slots, then you will need to repeat this a few times. You will also passively get letters over time from villagers and your mom. So if you want to, you can also just wait for those."

It is easiest to choose to write a letter to your future self since it is the first option on the list, but it is not necessary. You will then see the keyboard, and have the opportunity to compose a message, but since you\u2019re not actually going to send these letters, you don\u2019t really need to fill out a message. Just hit \u201cDone.\u201d"

This will cause the letter to have a present icon next to it. It can be particularly nice to place all of your tools into the letters, especially those that you don\u2019t use frequently since they take up a fair amount of your inventory space. Then, if you need to access those items or tools again, simply tap on the letter, and choose \u201cPresent.\u201d The item will then move from the letter back into your main inventory."
