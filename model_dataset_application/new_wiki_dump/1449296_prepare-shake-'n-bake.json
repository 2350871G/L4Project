      "description":"To make a basic shake and bake recipe combine 2 cups of all purpose flour, 2 cups of dried bread crumbs, 1 tbsp. (15 ml) salt, 1 tbsp. (30 ml) white sugar, 1 tsp. (5 ml) granulated garlic or garlic powder, 1 tsp. (5 ml) onion powder, 2 tbsp. (30 ml) smoked paprika, 1/2 tbsp. (8 ml) salt-free poultry seasoning and 1/2 tsp. (2 ml) in a large bowl. Mix well and then drizzle in 2 tbsp. (30 ml) of olive or vegetable oil. Mix well until the crumbs and oil are all combined."

      "headline":"Shake the meat.",
      "description":"Chicken legs or thighs and pork chops are the most common meats for shake and bake. For each 1 lb. (450 g) of meat you'll need 3/4 cup (175 ml) of shake and bake. Pour the necessary amount of shake and bake into a clean plastic bag. Moisten your meat with fresh water and then working 1 at a time, place each piece of meat into the bag and while holding the bag closed, shake it until the meat is well coated with the crumb mixture. Remove the meat and place it on a cookie sheet. Continue until all the meat is coated."

    {
      "headline":"Bake the meat.",
      "description":"Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). A hot oven is needed for the mixture to become crisp. Place the cookie tray of meat into the oven. For bone-in pork chops cook for about 20 minutes, longer if they're thicker. Pork should be cooked to an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Chicken legs will take about 30 minutes to fully cook, and should reach an internal temperature of 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Chicken thighs may take longer, depending on their size."

      "headline":"Personalize the shake and bake recipe.",
      "description":"Additional spices and herbs can be added to the basic recipe to change it up. For Italian shake and bake add 1 tsp. (5 ml) dried basil and 1 tsp. (5 ml) dried oregano. For Mexican shake and bake try adding a pinch of cayenne pepper and 1 tsp. (5 ml) cumin. Or you can add whatever herbs and spices you like."
