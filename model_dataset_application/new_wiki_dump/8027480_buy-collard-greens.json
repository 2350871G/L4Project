This process takes quite awhile, some recipes state upwards of two hours, so that the collards become nice and silky and so that they take on the flavor of the pork. Before you cook the greens you will need to cut them into smaller pieces. Remove the stems from the center of the leaves. Then roll up the remaining leaf pieces and cut them into one inch wide ribbons. There is a wide variety of other ways you can use collard greens.
