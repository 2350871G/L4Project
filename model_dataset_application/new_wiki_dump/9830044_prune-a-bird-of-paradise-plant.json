Red Bird of Paradise flowers are very hardy and can handle heavy pruning two times per year if the plant is healthy."

This will give you space to clear out the foliage and allow for new growth. When using the saw, work slowly. If you hit a particularly dense area, use your pruning shears to pre-cut some of the stems to make the area a little easier to cut through. A Bird of Paradise that is trimmed in this way will normally grow back within 1-2 blooming seasons if treated with water and fertilizer."

  "text":" Deciding When to Prune Begin pruning Yellow and Mexican varieties in late winter and early spring. After cold winter weather ends, you can start assessing your Yellow and Mexican Bird of Paradise flowers to prune them. Pruning at this point will encourage new growth in the plant later in the season. Both Yellow and Mexican Bird of Paradise flowers should be pruned sparingly when flowers and stems begin to die. Prune Strelitzia variety blooms sparingly in the spring. Strelitzia Bird of Paradise flowers don\u2019t require as much pruning, but you can remove dead blooms and foliage in the springtime. Only remove the stems and leaves that have died and are brown. If the plant isn\u2019t growing well throughout the year, prune at least half of the stems to the ground to allow the plant to grow healthy blooms.

Caring for Mature Plants Trim the outer ring of growth using your pruning shears. If you have a plant that is growing out of control and is wider than you\u2019d like, you can remove the outer edges of the plant by cutting the stems and leaves to the base.
