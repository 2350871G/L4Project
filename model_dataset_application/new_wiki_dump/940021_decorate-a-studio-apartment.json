You can create the feeling of three separate rooms by using the furniture to section off areas. Couches, armchairs, or loveseats can box off a \"living room\" area. Your bed can similarly separate your sleeping area. Rugs, coffee tables, or shelves can anchor your apartment furniture and make your apartment sub-rooms feel more organized."

Folding screen or ceiling-mounted drapes can take up minimal space in your studio when they're not being used. Try to section off the room into aesthetically-pleasing ratios.
