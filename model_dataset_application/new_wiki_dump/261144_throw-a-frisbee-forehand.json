          "description":"To properly grip the disc for the forehand, you'll need to use your thumb, index finger, and middle finger while keeping the other fingers out of the way. These three fingers alone should be enough to hold the weight of the disc and to give you the power and control you need. Here's how to grip the disc:\nYou'll need to stick your thumb out, thumbs up style, and make a peace sign with your index and middle finger, making sure your palm is facing the sky. These are the three fingers you'll need. Now, hold the disc with your left (or non-dominant) hand, logo side up, and place it over your \"peace sign\" fingers, while folding your thumb over the top of the disc. Then, fold your ring and pinkie fingers into your hand as if you were making a loose fist, just touching your palm, to keep them out of the way. Fold your middle finger toward your palm, pushing it against the inside of the rim. Your index finger should stay straight, pointed toward the center of the Frisbee, supporting some of its weight. Squeeze the disc, pushing your thumb down and your middle finger tight against the rim. For a variation, instead of the \"split fingers\" grip, you can move your index and middle fingers together for the power grip, which will give you more power but less control."

The power should come from the shoulder, passing naturally through the elbow and into the wrist, allowing the disc to spin. When you throw the disc, make sure that you rotate your body, using your throwing side first, and then your shoulders. Use your non-throwing hand to balance your body after it rotates, to create balance as you move it out and behind you a bit. You may be tempted to flip your wrist because of throwing balls or playing other sports. But for throwing a disc, you should keep your palm facing up toward the sky so the disc will come off flat instead of flipping over, which is a common problem many first-time forehand throwers have. If you've ever skipped rocks, you can think of the wrist movement as being similar. In a sense, you are skipping the rocks by throwing a forehand, if this helps."
