Famous quotes, a sports team logo, iconic landmarks, or humorous quotes can all add to the decor of your bar top.

Using wacky and colorful straws would have a different effect than plain and purely functional straws. Put out straws on your bar for people to use that reflect the style or theme of your bar. For example, a Caribbean or tiki-themed bar could use ornate straws that have Easter Island heads on them."

Unless your bar has a window that allows lots of light in, you\u2019ll need to choose an indoor plant that does well in low light. A decorative vase to hold your flowers can be a great decoration as well. Use fake flowers for an easy-to-maintain option.Tip: Use herbs in pots to decorate your bar and use in drinks. For example, you could keep mint and rosemary in small pots on your bar."

Depending on the look you\u2019re going for and your budget, you have several options to choose from for your bar countertop. Granite and marble countertops are expensive, but they last forever and create a very elegant, stylish appearance. Dark, well-grained wood fits into a traditional pub motif and will give your bar a warmer look and feel. Stainless steel or glass bar countertops will give your bar a modern, experimental vibe. Tile countertops are a less expensive but attractive option. Avoid surfaces that will warp, chip, crack, or scratch easily like vinyl or wood paneling."

The space doesn\u2019t need to just be a place for people to rest their feet! For example, if you had a white marble countertop, you could use a black coral pattern backsplash as a contrast."

A classic light fixture for many bars is the pendant lighting fixture. Use lower wattage or softer light bulbs if you want to create a pub-like atmosphere.
