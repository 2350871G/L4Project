          "description":"There are two main types of tea plants. Sinensis is recommended because it is hardy and you can make black, green, and white tea from its leaves. You can buy seeds from the local nursery or order them online. You will need about 2 to 3 square feet (1 square meter) of space once the sinensis begins to grow. Assamica is another type of tea plant. It\u2019s not recommended to grow this type of tea plant unless you live in a tropical climate. Also, this is a \u201clarge tree\u201d plant, so it requires at least 5 feet (1.5 m) once it begins to grow. You can make the same type of tea from this plant as you would from the sinensis."

          "description":"It\u2019s also an option to cut the stalk from an existing plant or buy a plant from the nursery. You can choose this option if you don\u2019t want to go through the process of germinating the seeds. If you choose to start with a plant, you will need to nurture it indoors for a year before moving it outside. It is best to begin nurturing it indoors during the spring or fall so that you can move it outside during the spring or fall, which is the best time to plant tea."

          "description":"Put your seeds into a bowl or container of water. Make sure there is enough water so that the seeds are completely submerged. Let the seeds soak for 24 to 48 hours. Allowing them to soak helps the seeds absorb water, which speeds up the process of germination."

          "description":"Take the seeds out of the water, and place 2 to 3 seeds each into separate containers. Place the containers in a warm, sunny location. Spray the seeds to dampen them. Wait a few minutes for the seeds to come back to air temperature. Then, cover the seeds with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of coarse vermiculite\u2014a brown mineral that helps the seeds retain moisture. Let the seeds germinate for 6 to 8 weeks. The number of containers you use depends on how many seeds you have. You can purchase coarse vermiculite at a nursery."

          "description":"During the 6 to 8 weeks, check the vermiculite daily to see how dry or damp it is. If it\u2019s dry, water the seeds. Do not soak the seeds. The soil should stay damp at all times. It is a best to use a spray bottle to avoid overwatering the plants."

Put each seedling into a separate pot that has been filled with acidic soil\u2014a pH range of 6 to 6.5 is ideal. Move the pots to a warm and partially shaded place. Spray the soil regularly to keep it moist. You can purchase acidic soil from your local nursery. Test  your own to see if it\u2019s acidic, or make it more acidic if it\u2019s not. To test the soil, you can use a strip test. There will be a color-coded key to tell you how acidic the soil is. If the soil isn\u2019t acidic, you can make it more acidic by adding elements such as sulfur and pine needles."

Tea plants can withstand a light frost, but it does not grow well in very cold climates. It is best, however, to plant the tea during a mild time of year\u2014like spring or fall\nIf you live in a subtropical or tropical climate, the tea can be planted at any time."

If you put them in new pots, make sure the pots will be big enough for plenty of root growth. A 6-inch (15.24 cm) pot should be large enough. If you plant them outside, plant them at least 3 feet (0.9 m) apart so they have room to grow. The soil should be slightly acidic. If planting outdoors, add sand to the soil to ensure it drains well. If planting indoors, add sphagnum moss to the pot. Plant the tea plant in a partly sunny and partly shady location. This means that the tea plant should get about 6 hours of sunlight daily."

If you see that the plant isn\u2019t thriving, you can \u201cfeed\u201d the plant ericaceous food, which is a type of fertilizer that is high in acidity.

Move the plants to a sheltered location or greenhouse during low winter temperatures. Generally, it is a good idea to move the plant if the temperature drops below 32\u02daF (0\u02daC).
