          "description":"The shoelace length depends on the number of eyelet pairs on your Converse shoes. You will need two different shoelaces in separate colors for this lacing style, but the two laces should be equal in length. You should select flat shoelaces that are fairly thin. Each eyelet will need to hold two layers of shoelace, so it is important that the shoelaces you choose are thin and flat, regardless of length. This lacing technique can be used on Converse with an odd number of eyelet pairs, but it will look most symmetrical with shoes that have an even number of pairs. If using two pairs of eyelets, choose shoelace 28 inches (71 cm) long. If using three pairs of eyelets, choose shoelaces 32 inches (81 cm) in length. If using four pairs of eyelets, choose shoelaces 36 inches (92 cm) long. If using five pairs of eyelets, use shoelaces 40 inches (102 cm) in length. If using six pairs of eyelets, use shoelaces 44 inches (113 cm) long. If using seven pairs of eyelets, use shoelaces 48 inches (123 cm) in length. If using eight pairs of eyelets, choose laces 53 inches (134 cm) long."

Make the length of each end as even as possible. This is the most traditional, common lacing style for shoes of all types. It is both simple and comfortable. Thread \"Side A\" up and across. Pull \"Side A,\" presently on the left side of the shoe, through the left bottom eyelet and into the right eyelet second from the bottom. This creates a diagonal line connecting the two eyelets. The shoelace should be pulled over the left bottom hole but pushed through the second-to-bottom hole on the right from the underside of the eyelet.

Pull the lace end through the left eyelet so that it pokes through and drapes over the top once again. Cross the two sides back and forth. Continue alternating \"Side A\" and \"Side B\" back and forth, criss-crossing the two laces until you reach the top pair of eyelets. Each end should be pulled through its eyelet and laced into the eyelet on the opposite side one row up. Pull the ends together at the top pair of eyelets. Pull the two ends together as they come out and over the top eyelets of your Converse shoes. This should create another horizontal pathway, similar to the one at the bottom. Tie a normal shoelace knot when slipping the shoes on your feet. You can also tuck the laces underneath the cushion of the shoe if you don't want the laces showing. Lacing a Straight Bar Pattern Bring \"Side A up. \"Side A,\" or the shoelace presently on the left side of the shoe, should be pulled through the left eyelet second from the bottom. Remember to keep the shoelace from curling up, especially if you are using flat laces. Thread \"Side A\" across. Pull the shoelace over the front of your shoe and into the right hole lying directly opposite the hole you pulled it through. You should see a horizontal bar across the front of your shoe. The end of this side should be tucked under the side of your Converse again.

Pull the shoelace end across the front of the shoe and lace it into the left eyelet third from the bottom, directly opposite the eyelet you pulled it through. This should create another horizontal bar across the front of your shoe, and the end should remain hidden from the front. Lace alternate eyelets in this pattern. \"Side A\" should be laced through the eyelet pairs second, fourth, and sixth from the bottom. \"Side B\" should be laced through the eyelet pairs third, fifth, and seventh from the bottom. This should leave you with a column of horizontal bars without any diagonal underlying. Pull through and tie the ends together. Pull \"Side A\" through the right eyelet and \"Side B\" through the left eyelet at the top pair. Tie together with a standard shoelace bow to complete. You can also tuck the laces underneath the cushion of your shoe so you don't have laces hanging out of the top. Threading a Double-Sided Lace Pattern Choose the right shoelaces.

If using four pairs of eyelets, choose shoelaces 36 inches (92 cm) long. If using five pairs of eyelets, use shoelaces 40 inches (102 cm) in length. If using six pairs of eyelets, use shoelaces 44 inches (113 cm) long. If using seven pairs of eyelets, use shoelaces 48 inches (123 cm) in length. If using eight pairs of eyelets, choose laces 53 inches (134 cm) long. Hold the two shoelaces together. Arrange the two shoelaces so that they are evenly lined up and back-to-back.

The shoelaces should be threaded into the eyelets from the bottom so that the ends come up through the eyelets. The ends should drape over the eyelet sides once this step is completed. Cross \"Side A\" diagonally upward. Pull \"Side A\" out of the bottom left eyelet and through the second-to-bottom right eyelet. Make sure that the shoelaces are twisted so that \"Color Two\" is now on top while \"Color One\" is hidden on the bottom. A diagonal line should connect the bottom and second-to-bottom holes on opposing sides of the Converse. Pull the laces from the underside of the right second-to-bottom hole and over the top. Cross \"Side B\" diagonally upward. Pull \"Side B\" out of the bottom right eyelet and through the second-to-bottom left eyelet. The shoelaces should be twisted to match the other half of the criss-cross. \"Color Two\" should show on the top and \"Color One\" should be hidden on the bottom. The two eyelets should be connected by a diagonal line. Pull the shoelaces through the left eyelet from the underside, letting them drape over the top of the left eyelet once you pull them through. Twist the shoelaces to the other side. Then repeat the crossing procedure. Repeat the criss-crossing pattern, but twist the shoelaces so that Color One is now on top while Color Two is now hidden on the bottom. Alternate \"Side A\" and \"Side B\" back and forth, criss-crossing the eyelets so that each end is pulled through its eyelet and into the eyelet on the opposite side one row up. Twist and cross until you reach the top. Continue twisting and criss-crossing the shoelaces. Each \"x\" across your shoes should be composed of a single color, but each \"x\" should be the opposite color of the \"x\" beneath it and above it. Pull the laces through the top and tie when ready. When you pull the shoelaces through the top set of eyelets, it does not matter which side of the double-lace shows. Both sides will show when you tie your shoes. Alternatively, you can make tying the shoes easier by tucking one color shoelace into the top of your shoe and only tying the other color in the front of your shoe.
