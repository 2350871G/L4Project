Sprinkle a light dusting of flour over the sink. Use about \u00bc cup (60mL) flour for an average kitchen sink. Buff the sink in a circular motion with a soft cloth, focusing on the rim and drain where food might get stuck. Once grime is removed, brush the flour into a container and throw it in the kitchen trash. Too much flour can block the drain."

If you try it, put just two or three drops of olive oil onto a soft cloth. Wipe the dry sink evenly until the entire surface is coated very lightly.
