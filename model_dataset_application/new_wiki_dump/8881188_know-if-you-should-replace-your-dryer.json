          "description":"The best way to tell if the appliance might be on its last legs is to simply see whether it's doing its job properly. Start paying close attention to how your appliance is working. If your clothes are coming out damp, for instance, it might mean that they just need a little more drying time, or it could indicate a problem with the dryer's heating elements. Look for recurring issues that point to a specific flaw in the unit itself. Failure to start, erratic drum rotation or a tendency to shut off mid-cycle are all common (and potentially serious) dryer issues."

Similarly, a burning smell could indicate that the dryer is overheating. For the most part, your dryer should not make any noises or give off any smells other than those associated with the normal drying cycle. If left unaddressed, problems like overheating can quickly lead to safety hazards."

For instance, bad wiring can prevent a perfectly good dryer from turning on, and regular overheating could be the result of a clogged lint trap. Seemingly serious problems sometimes have simple explanations. Make sure you've exhausted every other possible option before shelling out the money for expensive repairs."

If your dryer is approaching the 10 year mark, it may be a good idea to consider replacing it even if you haven't experienced any major performance issues yet. By springing for an updated model, you'll get a better return for your investment. The longer you use an old dryer, the more common malfunctions will become. This can get quite expensive after a while. It may help to look up consumer reviews on the internet to learn what other owners have to say about the longevity of your particular dryer model."
