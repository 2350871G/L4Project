Try to avoid pouring laundry detergent directly onto the velour, especially if the detergent is blue or green colored. The detergent can stick to the fabric and leave a mark."

Depending on the size of the item, you may need to add extra time to ensure that it\u2019s completely dry. Alternatively, you can hang the item in indirect sunlight to dry. This process takes longer, but is also safe for the fabric."
