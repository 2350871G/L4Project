Write the letters in pencil because they will act as guidelines. You will erase them later! It may be easier to practice on graph paper. Following the lines printed on the graph paper can help you create nice, even lines for your letters.

Adding 3D Perspective Choose a vantage point for your letters to make them 3D.
