          "description":"When a recipe calls for milk, use fat-free skim milk, 2% milk, or 1% milk instead of whole milk. These milk varieties are specifically processed to reduce the fat content. Cream cheese, sour cream, yogurt, and cheese also come in low-fat varieties. It\u2019s worth noting that low-fat dairy products may slightly alter the taste or consistency of your dishes."

          "description":"Butter keeps baked goods moist and binds them together, but applesauce can serve the same function without the fat. Replace half of the butter with applesauce. If the recipe calls for \u00bd cup (118 ml) of butter, use \u00bc cup (60 ml) butter and \u00bc cup unsweetened applesauce. This works especially well in cakes, but can be used in most baked goods. Experiment with applesauce in your favorite baked goods and see if people who taste them can tell the difference."

Mash the fruit or use a blender or food processor to puree the fruit completely. This works best for rich baked goods like chocolate cake and spiced muffins. Experiment to see which fruit works best in the recipes you usually make. Even if you only replace \u00bc of the butter with fruit, you\u2019ll reduce the fat and make your baked goods healthier."

Use a blend or coffee grinder to grind the flaxseed before you mix it with the water. Blend the mixture to produce a fluffy, sticky substance. Then stir the flaxseed mixture into the recipe when the egg is called for. Use in baked goods that can handle the nutty taste of flaxseed. Examples are pancakes, waffles, muffins, carrot cake, and oatmeal cookies."

Most store-bought meat will have a label that says the lean percentage. The higher the lean percentage, the less fat there is. If you can\u2019t tell by looking at the label of the meat, don\u2019t be afraid to ask an employee which meats are leanest. For example, if the lean percentage is 93, the meat is only 7% fat. If it is 80% lean, it is 20% fat. Try to avoid meats, like steak, that have visible fat along the edges or marbled throughout. When cooking meat, drain any fat in the pan after cooking."

Use a sharp knife and cut off as much of the fat as you can before you cook the meat. Don\u2019t bother slicing into the red muscle part of the meat, just trim the fat that is around the edges. Remove the skin from poultry before you eat it, as this also contains extra fat. The muscle itself still contains fat, so some fat will still be in the meat."
