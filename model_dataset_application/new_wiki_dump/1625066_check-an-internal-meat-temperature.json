  "text":" Buying a Thermometer Read the label to make sure you're buying a meat thermometer and not a candy or oven thermometer. If you think you may have difficulty operating a digital thermometer, buy one with a needle gauge. However, digital thermometers do have a distinct advantage. They provide a more precise temperature reading in a matter of seconds. This will keep less heat from escaping your oven or outdoor grill while your are checking the meat's temperature. Buy an instant-read thermometer for meats such as ground beef patties, pork chops or grilled chicken. An instant read thermometer is inserted into the meat at the end of cooking time to check the internal temperature. Purchase a probe thermometer for meats such as whole birds, ham, beef or lamb roasts. A probe is designed to be inserted in the meat before the meat is placed in the oven, and allows you to monitor the temperature and know when the meat has finished cooking. Use a meat thermometer specially designed for microwave use if you cook meat in the microwave.  Inserting the Thermometer Insert a probe thermometer into the thickest part of the meat, being careful not to touch the bone, which will be hotter than the meat around it. Don't allow the thermometer to rest on the roasting pan or dish. When cooking whole birds, insert the thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh with the readout or gauge toward the wing. Be careful that the thermometer doesn't touch the bone. Test steaks, ground beef patties and other thinner cuts of meat by inserting an instant-read thermometer 1.3 cm (0.5 inches) into the meat. Be careful not insert the thermometer completely through the meat, and avoid touching the grill, pan or plate. If you're using a needle gauge, wait a few seconds for the needle to stop moving before reading the temperature. Remove the thinnest cuts of meat from the stove-top or grill and test by inserting the thermometer from the side to prevent touching the thermometer to the pan or grill.  Temperatures Grill or roast beef and lamb to different temperatures depending on the desired term. These cuts of meat will have contaminating bacteria only on the outside, so it's safe to leave the center less than thoroughly cooked. Medium rare (bright pink center): 63\u00b0C (145\u00b0F)\nMedium (light pink center): 71\u00b0C (160\u00b0F)\nWell done (no pink): 77\u00b0C (170\u00b0F) Cook ground beef, pork, chicken or turkey to a temperature of 74\u00b0C (165\u00b0F). Because the meat is ground, contaminating bacteria might be present throughout the meat. It's therefore never safe to serve ground meat that's less than well done. Roast whole birds or breasts to a temperature of 74\u00b0C (165\u00b0F). You should also cook the stuffing to 74\u00b0C (165\u00b0F), since many stuffing recipes incorporate juices or other parts of the bird. Roast, fry or grill pork to a temperature of at least 64\u00b0C (145\u00b0F). It's not safe to serve undercooked pork because the meat may contain parasites that cause trichinosis. Heat a cooked ham until the internal temperature is 60\u00b0C (140\u00b0C). An uncooked ham should be roasted until to 63\u00b0C (145\u00b0F). Cook most fish to a temperature of 60\u00b0C (140\u00b0F). Game fish such as tuna or marlin should only be cooked to an internal temperature of 52\u00b0C (125\u00b0F) or it will dry out and become unpalatable. Reheat all leftovers until they reach a temperature of 74\u00b0C (165\u00b0F).  Remove egg dishes and casseroles from the oven when the temperature reaches 71\u00b0C (160\u00b0F) and casseroles when they reach 74\u00b0C (165\u00b0F). ",
