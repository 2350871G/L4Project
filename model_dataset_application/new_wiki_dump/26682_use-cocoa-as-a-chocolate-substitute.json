If you're trying to substitute for chocolate chips, you may be fighting an uphill battle. It won't taste the same as you're envisioning, but it is technically possible. To work backwards, a 12 oz bag of chocolate chips is 2 cups. 1 oz of baking chocolate is usually 1 or 2 squares. If using butter or margarine, soften it before beginning."
