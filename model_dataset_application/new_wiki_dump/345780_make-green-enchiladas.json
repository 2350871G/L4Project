  "text":" Preparing the Chicken Wash the chicken. Rinse each chicken part thoroughly in cool water, then pat them dry with paper towels. Poach the chicken. Place the chicken pieces in a large pot. Cover with an inch of water and sprinkle in a teaspoon of salt. Turn the burner to medium low and let the chicken simmer and cook for 30 minutes. If you prefer the flavor of baked chicken, place the chicken pieces in a baking pan, coat them with a suitable cooking olive oil, and bake in an oven preheated to 350 degrees for 30 minutes. You could also slow roast the chicken over a grill, though this method takes much longer. Cook the chicken on a grill heated to medium, turning frequently. Cool the chicken. Place the chicken on a cutting board and allow it to cool for about 5 minutes. Shred the chicken. Remove the chicken skin from each piece. Use two forks to pull the chicken meat apart, creating shredded pieces. Pile them up in a bowl and finish shredding each piece of chicken. Add seasoning. Open the seasoning mix, or create your own combination or herbs and spices, and mix it in a bowl with a tablespoon of water. Pour the seasoning over the shredded chicken and toss so that each piece gets coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a lid and set it aside. Making the Sauce Prepare the tomatillos. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees or equivalent. Peel the dry husk from the tomatillos. Rinse them in cool water and shake dry. Use a paring knife to half each tomatillo. Place the tomatillos on a baking sheet and drizzle with a suitable cooking olive oil. Roast the tomatillos until they wilt and release their juices, about 5 - 7 minutes. Remove them from the oven. Prepare the chilies. Chop the tops off the chilies and slice them lengthwise. Remove the seeds. Finely chop the deseeded flesh. Avoid touching your face and eyes while you're handling chilies. You may want to wear protective gloves. If you'd prefer not to make your sauce spicy, use poblano peppers or your favourite hot chilli. Chop the remaining sauce components. Finley chop the garlic, onion, and cilantro. Cook the sauce. Heat a tablespoon of lard, butter or oil in a large skillet or frying pan. When the fat is hot, add the chilies, garlic, onion, cilantro, and tomatillos. Crush the tomatillos with the back of a wooden spoon as you fry the mixture. Continue cooking until the vegetables break down and meld into a fragrant sauce. Taste the sauce and add salt and pepper to taste. To spice things up, add more chopped jalapeno or hot chilies. Assembling the Enchiladas Mix half the enchilada sauce with the chicken. Pour it into the bowl with the chicken and use a spoon to stir the mixture thoroughly. Set the other half of the sauce aside. Soften the tortillas. Heat a cast iron skillet or frying pan with a coating of oil over medium heat. When the oil is hot, place a tortilla in the pan and let it cook for about 30 seconds. Flip it over to cook for 30 seconds on the other side, then remove it from heat and set it on a plate with paper towels. Repeat with the remaining tortillas. If your pan or skillet is large enough, soften more than one tortilla at a time. Add more oil as needed, since the tortillas will absorb it as they cook. Stuff the tortillas. Take a tortilla and fill it with a few spoonfuls of the chicken and sauce mix. Sprinkle a liberal amount of cheese over the chicken. Roll the tortilla and place it seam-side down in a greased casserole dish. Repeat the process with the remaining tortillas and chicken mixture. Finish the enchiladas. Pour the remaining sauce over the enchiladas, and top with a sprinkling of grated or shredded cheese. Bake the enchiladas. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Place the enchiladas in the oven and bake until the cheese bubbles, about 25 minutes. Remove them from the oven and serve hot with sour cream, lettuce, and tortilla chips. Finished. ",
