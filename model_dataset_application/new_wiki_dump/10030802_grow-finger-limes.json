If your local nursery doesn\u2019t carry finger lime trees, they will most likely be happy to order one for you. All you have to do is ask! If you cannot obtain a finger lime tree locally, you can order one from an online nursery."

Finger limes can grow in a wide range of soil\u2014the most important thing to is make sure it won\u2019t be sitting in stagnant water. Soil with a pH of 5-7 is recommended for finger limes. When you buy soil, the bag will indicate what the pH level is. If you are uncertain, ask someone at your local nursery for advice."

If you do opt to plant seeds, make sure to use fresh ones. Even with fresh seeds, the finger lime tree is slow to grow and seedlings have a low success rate. Plant seeds in a cell tray with drains about 2 inches (51 mm) deep in the soil. Use your finger to make the hole, then drop a seed into it. Cover it back up with soil. Keep in bright sun (or under a sun lamp) and water every 3-4 days, keeping the soil moist. Once seeds start to sprout, you can replant them in individual pots. Continue moving the seedlings to larger and larger pots as they grow."

This tree does well in partial shade to direct sunlight. Dig a hole in the ground deep enough for the roots of the tree. Place the tree in the hole and fill in the remaining area with additional soil. You want the tree to be able to stand on its own. The finger lime tree makes a good hedge and the leaves will grow flat against a wall or lattice. Avoid windy locations when planting your tree. The tree has sharp thorns which easily puncture the skin of the finger lime. This is a cosmetic concern, as the fruit should still be usable; it will just be bruised and may leak juice, which can attract pests."

Planting it in a pot will allow you to move it indoors when the weather gets cold. Use a 5 US gal (19 L) pot for your finger lime tree. This will give it room to expand and grow roots as the years pass. Make sure there is a hole in the bottom for drainage. Fill your pot with soil and then push the dirt in the middle to the sides to bury the roots of your tree. Add more soil around the base of your plant until the pot is full. The soil should fill the pot but should not be packed down. The tree should be able to stand firmly on its own without support. If it doesn\u2019t, you haven\u2019t planted it deep enough."
