At the start of the game, you are provided with a cavalry scout. Use the scout to quickly explore the area near your Town Center for food by moving him around the unexplored areas. There usually are a few sheep in the unexplored areas close to the Town Center. Send those back to the Town Center so villagers can gather food from them while easily storing it there. Also be on the lookout for cherry bushes, which are another source of food."

Use 150 Wood to construct a fishing dock and the remainder to create two fishing ships (at 75 Wood each). Command the fishing ships to fish.

A Stable costs various amounts of Wood in the different versions of Age of Empires (i.e., 175 Wood in AoE3, 175 Wood in AoE2, and 150 Wood in AoE1). Create a horseback unit from the Stable.
