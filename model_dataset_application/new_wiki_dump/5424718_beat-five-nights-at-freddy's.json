      "headline":"Know there are four main animatronics.",
      "description":"The four animatronics are Bonnie the Bunny, Chica the Chicken, Foxy the Fox Pirate, and Freddy Fazbear. These animatronics are listed in order of activeness. Bonnie is the most active, while Freddy is the least. Bonnie and Foxy come to the left door, and Chica and Freddy always comes to the right door. Sometimes another animatronic, Golden Freddy, will appear. You can get rid of him by pulling up the monitor for a few seconds, then putting it back down."

    {
      "headline":"Check the door lights and cameras only sparingly on Night 1.",
      "description":"However, this is all you'll need. The animatronics rarely attack, making this the best night to try to find Golden Freddy. Freddy is not active at all, (unless if you run out of power) Bonnie and Chica are not very active, and Foxy only has a small chance of appearing."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Check the doors rapidly on Night 2.",
      "description":"Bonnie and Chica are activated much faster than on Night one. Foxy also appears, making the player constantly check the cameras. This is the final night where Freddy only attacks you if you run out of power. Once you check both doors about 7 or 8 times, check Pirate's Cove. Then, go back to checking your doors and rotate between the two."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Check the door lights more often than on the previous two nights on Night 3.",
      "description":"Chica and Bonnie become significantly more aggressive. Foxy also peeks out of the cove much faster than on Night two, so keep an eye on that. Freddy also becomes active on this night, but only a little. He will attack if not kept a close eye on. Use the same method for Night 2, except look at the Show Stage occasionally as well. If Freddy is getting closer (i.e. East Hall or East Hall Corner), you may want to shut your Right Door whenever you check the cameras. Freddy is most likely to move when the monitor is raised."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Use the method of checking door lights more, but be more aware of Freddy's laugh on Night 4.",
      "description":"Freddy is much more active and is aware of the player's gameplay tactics. He is incredibly difficult to understand, predict, and deal with from now on. Chica and Bonnie have the ability to make the doors and door lights fail completely, indicating they have infiltrated The Office and will attack when the monitor is next lowered or up for too long. Foxy is also very active, sometimes peeking out before 1 AM."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Check Foxy and Freddy and check the doors while keeping the right door shut when viewing the monitor on Night 5.",
      "description":"Night 5 is where the game gets incredibly brutal. The animatronics are more active than ever. Just repeat this and you will (hopefully) survive the night, get a paycheck, and unlock the secret sixth night."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Use the same method for Nights 3 to 5 on Night 6, but be much quicker and more efficient.",
      "description":"In order to complete the night, it is advised to have certain amounts of power at certain times. 1 AM needs at least 80%, 2 AM needs at least 60%, 3 AM needs at least 40%, 4 AM needs at least 25%, and 5 AM needs at least 9%. Completing Night 6 will unlock Night 7 (the Custom Night)."

    {
      "headline":"Beat Night 7 (the Custom Night).",
      "description":"After you unlock Night 7, you can set any animatronics' AI (excluding Golden Freddy) from 0 to 20. Beating 20/20/20/20 mode will unlock a 3rd star. In order to beat 20/20/20/20 you need to be extremely fast and efficient. Perform and then repeat this process: Go to the east hall corner. Pull down the camera. Look at the right door light (close if needed). Look back at the camera. Pull down the camera. Look at the left hall light (close if needed). At the end of 20/20/20/20, you will get fired, and get the 3rd star. Foxy and Freddy won't kill you unless you stop looking at the east hall corner, because Freddy will sneak into the room. Foxy will not kill you because having the camera up stops him, and if you do it fast enough, he won't get a chance to move at all. You shouldn't run out of power with the strategy explained above and if you do, you wouldn't die because you're so close to 6 AM."
