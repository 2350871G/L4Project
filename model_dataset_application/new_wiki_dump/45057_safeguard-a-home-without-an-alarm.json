If you just moved into a new home, ask the landlord if the locks have been changed since the previous owner moved out. If you have a fenced backyard, you can also buy a padlock for the gate.

Adrian has over 25 years of self defense training experience. Adrian Tandez\t\t\tSelf Defense Trainer\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: To keep your home as secure as possible, always lock your doors before you go to sleep. If you feel like you're in a dangerous neighborhood, you need as much security as you can. The best thing is to install a security system, but even a security camera can work for you."

If you are going to be gone for a while, have them check in on your home every couple days or so."

If you have sliding-glass doors, or windows that slide open, insert broom handles or long pieces of wood along the track at the base of each door and window. This will make them impossible to open. Don\u2019t do this on the door that you use to enter your home. You don't want to lock yourself out."
