Water your lawn early in the morning or after the sun goes down. This will allow the grass to soak up the water before the sun dries it up. For example, you could set your sprinklers to go off first thing in the morning, or water your lawn with a hose right before you go to bed at night.

Some ways to tell if you need to aerate your lawn include:\nThe grass looks thin or patchy. The lawn is heavily used, walked on, or driven on. The soil is a heavy clay type.

A core aerator has hollow tubes or times that punch into the ground. Avoid aerators with solid tubes or spikes because these will compact the soil. Core aerators are expensive to purchase and rent, so you may want to band together with your neighbors to rent one for a weekend. An aerator is a heavy duty piece of equipment, so you will also need some help using the machine, such as someone to help you transport it to and from your property.

The lawn should not be soaking wet, but it should be moist to get the best results. If your area has been experiencing excessive or prolonged rainy weather, then you may need to wait until the soil dries to aerate it. Before you aerate, the lawn needs 1 inch (2.5 cm) of watering to ensure it is moist. Measure down into the soil to make sure that the moisture extends down by 1 inch (2.5 cm) and then wait 1 to 2 days before aerating."

Also, do not aerate the lawn in 1 direction only. Go back and forth across the lawn so that each section of your lawn is aerated from at least 2 different directions. This will help to improve the air, water, and nutrient flow of the lawn. For example, you could aerate the lawn in straight lines going from left to right, and then aerate over those lines again going from right to left."

You can also put on a pair of gardening gloves and pull weeds by hand. Pulling weeds by hand is time consuming, but you may prefer this option if you do not want to spray chemicals on your lawn due to children and pets playing on the lawn.
