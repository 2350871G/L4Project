      "headline":"Locate and turn off the water supply.",
      "description":"This can be done by switching off the water pump's breaker, turning its power off at the pump box, or closing the valve manually. Doing so will stop the supply of water to the underground pipes, making for a clean repair with lower chance of self harm. If your water pump starts running during repairs, it will create quite a mess."

      "headline":"Locate the broken head.",
      "description":"Carefully dig the patch of grass in a circular motion with a spade shovel around the sprinkler head, being careful to not sever electrical lines or water lines underground. Doing so will leave with with large chunks of sod. Remove the circular patch of grass and set it aside for when you fill in the hole. Keep digging by hand until you reveal the piping and wires for your system so you can observe what may have broken."

      "headline":"Unscrew the wire nuts connecting the head's solenoid to the leads.",
      "description":"Unscrew the head from the water supply. If head is on too tight, grab head with tongue and groove pliers and turn counterclockwise to loosen. Examine the head to identify the cause of the problem. Abrasions on the top of the head due to mower blades hitting it may be prevalent. The center part of the head may be completely clipped off by a mower as well. Your solenoid (the part with the wires coming out that opens the valve of the head) may be burnt up. You can determine if the solenoid is burnt up by examining the wires running into it for any burnt marks, examining the solenoid itself by testing the leads with a multi-meter, or seeing if there are any scorch marks on it followed by a burnt smell. Replacing just a solenoid on an automatic sprinkler head can be much cheaper than replacing the whole head."

      "headline":"Examine the underground water piping to see if any damage has occurred.",
      "description":"Often times a mower may have driven over the head and snapped the piping below it. The head may still be reusable. If no damage to piping has occurred, you can skip the repairing steps."

Fit the new elbow on the freshly glued surface and make sure it is pointing 90 degrees to the ground (so the sprinkler head is flush with the ground)."

Cut the new assembly with the head on it to the same length as the old. This will assure that your sprinkler head is the same level above ground as the old one. If the old head was too far above the ground causing it to be hit, trim down the new assembly slightly shorter to your desired height."
