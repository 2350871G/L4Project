    {
      "headline":"Visit your garden centre.",
      "description":"Pick up some bags of rich, organic soil that are multi-purpose (good for use in the veggie patch and flower beds, pots, etc.). Flowers are essential in any garden that evokes a magical quality. Green plants add a lush element. Opt for native plants. Native plants and flowers are beautiful and they survive on less water than invasive species, so they're eco-friendly and economic too!"

      "description":"Most garden centres offer lovely decorative crafts that can be nestled into flower beds. Ceramic figures of birds, mushrooms and snails look adorable peeking out from flowers and shrubs. Tree stumps and wooden bird feeders add a great natural element as well. Stepping stones will lead your guests from one end of the garden to the other."
