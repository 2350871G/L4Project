This will keep the plywood out of your way while still protecting it from warping. You can purchase a hanging storage storage rack from a hardware store for around $100 USD, or you can design and build a custom rack if you prefer. Most ceiling beams can safely support about 160 pounds (73 kg). This means you can safely store 3 sheets of \u20442 in (1.3 cm) thick plywood, or 2 sheets if they are \u20448 in (1.6 cm) thick."

Place a support beam at each end of the rack and one in the middle to hold the plywood in place. Attach a piece of scrap plywood to the bottom of the rack to protect the plywood from moisture seeping in through the floor. If you build your own storage rack, the possibilities for customizing it are endless. You can choose whether to store the plywood on its end or rest it on its side. You can also choose whether to mount the rack to the wall or attach casters to the bottom so you can easily move it.
