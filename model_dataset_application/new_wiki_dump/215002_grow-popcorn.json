Not all store-bought popcorn will be fertile because of the heating and sterilization processes popcorn goes through before being packaged and sold. You can also buy popcorn seeds from a seed company or from a farmer. To test store-bought popcorn for fertility: sow 20 seeds, water, and wait. If the corn grows in about a week, you have fertile seeds. If 2 weeks pass, and you still don't see any sprouts emerging, you have infertile seeds. The seeds must be fertile in order to grow."
