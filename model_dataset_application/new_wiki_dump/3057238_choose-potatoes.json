Getting soft is one of the first indications that a potato is going bad, so avoid potatoes that feel squishy or soft when you squeeze them. Although soft potatoes are safe to eat if you already have one at home, avoid buying them from the store unless you plan to cook them immediately."

          "description":"Cuts and blemishes can lead to decay, and they can also provide a place where bacteria or mold can get into the potato. When choosing potatoes, turn them over and inspect all sides for gouges, dents, cuts, and other open spots in the skin. Potatoes with minor surface blemishes are safe to eat, as long as you cut away the affected area. You'll get more potato for your money if you buy potatoes that are clean, smooth, and unblemished."

          "description":"Because potatoes are grown in the ground, it\u2019s normal and natural for them to smell faintly of soil. Before adding a potato to your cart, put it up to your nose and inhale. Although potatoes should smell faintly of soil, the skin should be relatively clean and free of dirt."

Don\u2019t buy sprouting potatoes unless you're going to cook them within a day or two. Before cooking, dig out any eyes that are growing from the potato with a spoon or cut them off with a knife."

          "description":"Potatoes grow underground, so if they're exposed to the sun, it means they're vulnerable to predators. To protect themselves, potatoes produce a chemical called solanine, which makes the potato taste bitter and unappealing. When eaten in large quantities, solanine can cause gastrointestinal discomfort, diarrhea, and hallucinations. Potatoes with a shallow layer of green buildup are safe to eat, as long as you cut away the affected portions. You'll get more for your money if you avoid green potatoes."

Turn the potato over in your hand and look for black spots, dark areas, and bruises that would have to be cut away. Bruising is typically a sign of rough handling, but dark spots can also be a sign of blight or fungal infection."

Once cooked, whole new potatoes are often tossed with butter, oil, and seasonings like salt, pepper, garlic, and herbs.
