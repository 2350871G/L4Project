          "description":"Spider mites thrive in dry conditions, and simply watering your plants will act as a deterrent for any intruding mites. Watering your plants will also knock any spider mites that are already on your plants. The humidity will also make your plants an unattractive place for colonies that are looking for a home. If you have a plant that isn\u2019t supposed to receive a lot of water regularly, mist it with a spray bottle in regular intervals instead of giving it a single, larger watering. Use a firm setting on your water nozzle to water your plants if you can. Don\u2019t knock off any leaves or petals though!"

          "description":"Mites will often nest underneath the debris that falls off of plants. Inspect your garden and house plants regularly to look for leaves that have fallen off. Remove them and throw them out every day to keep mites from finding a place to call home. Mites feed on plants and cause leaves and petals to fall off at a faster rate than they normally would. If you find yourself picking up pieces of your plants every day, it could be a sign that you already have mites."

If you can bundle your plants into a single section of your garden or home, the area under the leaves will remain shaded and will trap moisture for longer. Spider mites hate humidity and shade, so they\u2019ll be unlikely to hang out inside these areas."

          "description":"Use a canopy or plant your plants under a tree to keep them shaded in the afternoon. Most plants need sunlight, but they can usually handle a little shade in the afternoon. Mites prefer to feed in the afternoon, but they require sunny conditions. Covering your plants will make the mites uncomfortable and they\u2019ll likely look for a different set of plants to feed on. Move indoor plants away from the windows in the afternoon to keep them out of the sun. You can also simply set indoor plants up at east-facing windows so that they only get sun in the morning. Move outdoor potted plants to a shady area in the afternoon."

Trim and remove any leaves or petals that develop mold or mildew, and give your plants a break from the watering and shading if you notice fungal growth. Wait 2 days before resuming treatment to cut off fungal growth. You can put a fan out near your plants on days where there isn\u2019t any wind to give your plants some air. Get a humidity reader for indoor plants. Place it on the wall next to your plants. Turn humidifiers off and turn fans on if the humidity is higher than 85%."

Ladybugs are a natural predator of spider mites and will feed on any mites that wander into your garden. If you buy ladybugs, store them in your refrigerator for 20-45 minutes and release them in the afternoon to keep them calm and increase the chances that they stick around.Tip: To attract ladybugs with raisins, stick a few raisins in a large straw or bamboo stalk and leave it on your deck or window sill where bugs on the ground won\u2019t be able to get at them. The ladybugs will feed on the raisins when there are no aphids or mites around. Ladybugs are generally a good pest control solution for your garden. They feed on a lot of bugs that aren\u2019t good for garden plants without harming them."

This makes them an excellent preventative measure if you\u2019ve seen a few spider mites but otherwise don\u2019t want to modify the ecology of your garden. Buy 1,000 predator mites from a pest control service and release them in your garden. Predatory mites won\u2019t stick around for long if there isn\u2019t any food around, so you should feel a sense of relief if they disappear after a few days.

Marigolds, fennel, and alfalfa are all excellent choices that will attract pirate bugs. It can be easy to mistake pirate bugs for spider mites. The difference is that pirate bugs are black or purple while spider mites are yellow or tan. Attracting pirate bugs can take a little bit of time. This makes them a great preventative measure, but a terrible choice if you\u2019ve already seen mites in your garden."

Spray it on to your plants by using the widest nozzle setting. After using your summer oil, allow it to dry on your plants. The dried oil will act as a protective cover for your plants. Don\u2019t forget to coat the underside of your leaves. You can use dormant oil to protect your plants in the winter months, but that shouldn\u2019t be necessary if you don\u2019t have an active infestation. More than 2 applications will be overkill.

Neem oil works a lot like summer oil in the sense that it protects plants, but it will repel other predators as well. To use neem oil, pick up a bottle and spray it all over your plants. Let it dry on the leaves to coat them in the oil. Neem oil isn\u2019t a great idea if you\u2019re trying to attract ladybugs to your garden. They tend to hate neem oil as well.
