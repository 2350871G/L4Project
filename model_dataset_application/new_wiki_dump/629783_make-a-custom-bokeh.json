Your lens will be having to shoot through the cutout, so the closer to exact center that you are at, the better. Depending on the size of your lens, your finished design/shape will be about \u20442 to \u20444 inch (1.3 to 1.9 cm) in size. The size of the bokeh needs to be smaller than the aperture you are using. For example, If you use 5.6, then the bokeh shape needs to be 8 or less. UV Filter Bokeh If using a filter, measure the inside circumference of the filter. This example traces the outside of the filter which is actually too large. If you have a compass, once you know the size that it needs to be, that will simplify the matter greatly. Once you have the measurements, make a template. You will probably want one for each different size lens that you have. Keep in mind that the template for fitting inside of a filter and going onto a 'hood' for your lens will be two different sizes. Hooded Bokeh Measure the outside circumference of your lens. One way of doing this, if you don't have a tape measure is to take a string and measure around the lens and then add an inch to an inch and a half. If it is too long, you can always trim it. Cut a rectangular piece of whatever you are using, (thin plastic, poster board) with enough left over so that you can fasten it somehow.  Measure the circumference of the bokeh after assembled for the 'end cap'.  Fasten it together with some type of tape.  Put the pieces together. Note that there is a very small gap. It might indicate that your end cap needs to be slightly larger. Measure all the parts. If you are just starting out making your own bokehs, you will want to have the measurements so that you can make a collection. The lens measurements for this example were 10 and 1/2 inches x 2 and 1/4 inches. The end cap's circumference was 2 and 3/4 inches. A wingding about the size 48 is a good size for the center piece.
