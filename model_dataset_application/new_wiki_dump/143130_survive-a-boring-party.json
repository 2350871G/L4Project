Being open to conversation and other party guests will help you stay engaged and make the party seem a lot more bearable. Always try to stay open to new conversations and the possibility that the party isn't as boring as you first thought. Even if you aren't immediately interested in a conversation, try to give it a chance and see where it goes. Shutting down and deciding the party is dull will only make your time at the party even more boring."

It's a lot of fun to see what the original word ends up being. Try asking everyone to say a certain word without showing their teeth. You can play in teams and eliminate players who show their teeth when talking. You can always try playing the classic game of charades if things get dull.
