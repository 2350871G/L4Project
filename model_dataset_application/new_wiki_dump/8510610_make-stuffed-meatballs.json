Remove the meatballs to a serving plate and fry another batch of meatballs (if you couldn't fit all of them in at once). You can garnish the stuffed meatballs with 2 tablespoons of minced fresh parsley. Consider serving the meatballs with a dipping sauce or glaze them with a little honey and pomegranate molasses."
