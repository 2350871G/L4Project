  "text":" Gelatin Fill a large stockpot with all of the gelatin ingredients.  Heat the stockpot to a boil. The water will bubble once it has boiled. Once the stockpot has boiled, turn down the stove heat to a simmer and let sit for 3 hours.  Strain the liquid into a container. Store in the refrigerator for at least 1 day. Cut the solidified gelatin into cubes the size of the tip of your pinky finger.  Dumpling Mixture Mix the dumpling ingredients into a large mixing bowl.  Store in refrigerator until xiaolongbao dough wraps are finished.  Xiaolongbao Dough Wraps Put the dry ingredients for the wraps into another large mixing bowl.  Pour 2 cups of the warm water into the flour. Do not add all 4 cups. Gradually add the remaining 2 cups of water as you knead the dough.  Pull dough to see if dough is stretchy. If not, add more water. Set aside for 20 minutes.  Portion the dough into small balls with a diameter the size of a pen cap length (1 inch).  Rub some water onto the outside of the dough ball to keep it from drying.  Flatten the dough by squishing the ball down and roll into a flat circle.  Add 2 tablespoons of filling and 1 cube of gelatin to the middle of the dough circle. Adjust amounts to prevent skin from breaking. Fold one end up. About a finger space away, fold up again and overlap the first fold to form pleats. Twist the top of the pleats clockwise to seal the filling in.  Place dumplings on a lined bamboo basket steamer. Each basket steamer can hold 6-8 dumplings. Fill a steam cooker 1/3 way full with water and wait for water to boil.  Once water is boiling, place the entire basket into the steam cooker and steam for 8-10 minutes.  Serve with black vinegar and ginger slices. ",
