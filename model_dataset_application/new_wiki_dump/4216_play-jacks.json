The number of jacks you need depends on which variation of the game you're playing, though most sets will have ten jacks. Jacks sets, which include a ball, a set of jacks, and a pouch to hold them in, can be found at most toy stores. The ancient form of jacks was called knucklebones, because instead of today's modern metal jacks, the knucklebones of sheep or goats were used."
