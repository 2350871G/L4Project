The blade that your machine came with is a fine point blade, which is good for cutting paper and other thin materials, such as vinyl or iron-on sheets. If a material is easily torn with your fingers, it's likely thin enough to be cut with a fine-point blade."

This is a good supplementary blade to use for special projects in addition to the regular fine-point blade. If you are unsure if you need a deep-point blade, you can try using a fine-point blade first. If it doesn't cut all the way through your material or the cut is uneven or jagged, then you should try using a deep-point blade instead.

Be sure that the blade housing is sitting down as far as possible in the cutting assembly. If it is sitting high in the assembly, it won\u2019t cut properly. Putting in a Knife Point Blade Remove the blade housing from the cutting assembly. Just as with the other types of blades, you need to release the blade housing from the assembly by pulling the tab that has a \u201cB\u201d on it towards you.

Swapping out a Rotary Blade Take the blade housing out of the cutting assembly. The cutting assembly is a box at the front of the machine with tabs that say \"A\" and \"B\" on it. Release the clamp marked \u201cB\u201d on the housing assembly by pulling the tab gently towards you. This will release the blade housing, which you can then lift up and out of the assembly. Be careful as you are lifting it out of the machine that you keep your fingers and other body parts away from the cutting blade at the bottom. Put a protective cover over the blade. A rotary blade is very sharp and it rotates easily, so it's important to keep it covered while you change it out. Remove the protective cap from the new blade and carefully place it over the old blade that's attached to the machine. Unscrew and remove the old blade. Hold the blade assembly firmly in one hand. Use the screwdriver that came with your new rotary blade to unscrew the screw on the side of the blade housing.
