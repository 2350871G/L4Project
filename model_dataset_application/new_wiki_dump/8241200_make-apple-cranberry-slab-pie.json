          "description":"Place 3 \u00be cups (450 g) of flour and 1 teaspoon of fine sea salt in a food processor. Dice 30 tablespoons (425 g) of chilled butter and cover the food processor. Blitz the dough ingredients until the mixture becomes crumbly. Add one tablespoon of water at a time and pulse the mixture until it starts come together. You'll need about 6 to 8 tablespoons of ice water. Since there's so much butter in this pastry dough, it's recommended that you use a food processor. This will make it easier to mix together than cutting in the butter by hand."

          "headline":"Chill the pastry dough.",
          "description":"Remove the dough from the food processor and divide it into two balls of different sizes. One ball should be about 2/3 of the dough and the other ball should be the remaining 1/3 of the dough. Flatten each ball into a disk about 1-inch thick and wrap them tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough for at least 1 hour. You can chill the dough for up to 2 days before you're ready to roll out the slab pie."

Place the rolled pastry to a 9x13-inch baking dish and press the dough so it comes up the sides of the pan. Crimp the top edges of the pastry so they look decorative. Refrigerate the pastry-lined pan while you make the filling and roll out the top pastry pieces."

Use a cookie cutter in any shape to cut out the dough into shapes. You can reroll the pastry dough and cut out more shapes until you run out of dough. Place the cutouts on a baking sheet and refrigerate them. You can use apple, leaf, heart, snowflake, or pumpkin cookie cutters."

Place the apples in a large mixing bowl along with the filling ingredients and stir them till they're combined. Let the mixture sit 10 minutes. For the filling, you'll need to add:\n1 \u00bd cups (300 g) of packed brown sugar\n\u00be cup(255 g) of maple syrup\n1 cup (150 g) of dried cranberries\n6 tablespoons (75 g) of instant tapioca\n3 tablespoons of dark rum\n1 \u00bd teaspoons of finely grated lemon zest\n2 tablespoons of lemon juice\n1 tablespoon of grated fresh ginger\n1 \u00bc teaspoons of fine sea salt\n2 \u00bc teaspoons of ground cinnamon\n\u00be teaspoon of grated nutmeg"

Lay the pastry dough cutouts over the apple filling. The pieces should overlap to cover the filling. Brush the cutouts with the egg wash and sprinkle the top of the pie with 1 1/2 tablespoons (20 g) of coarse sugar. To make the egg wash, simply beat 1 egg with 1 tablespoon of heavy cream in a small bowl."

Combine 3/4 cup (60 g) of rolled oats, 3 tablespoons of flour, 7 tablespoons (87 g) of packed brown sugar and 1 big pinch of salt in a mixing bowl. Mix in 6 tablespoons (85 g) of unsalted butter, cold and cut into 1/4 inch pieces. Combine the mixture until it's coarse and crumbly like sand. Sprinkle it over the top of the slab pie. You could also add chopped toasted nuts for extra crunch. You might use chopped almonds, pecans, or walnuts."

Turn down the oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 C) and bake the pie for another 40 to 60 minutes. The pastry should become golden brown and the filling will bubble up before you remove it from the oven. Cool the pie completely before you cut and serve it. Placing the pie on the baking sheet will keep the filling from bubbling up and onto the floor of the oven, where it could burn."
