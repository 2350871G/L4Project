If you don\u2019t discover a hive or nest in an area that you frequent, and no one in your home is allergic, they likely don't need to be killed. Africanized honey bees are slightly smaller than their European counterparts. They can be distinguished by their golden-brown color, thin coating of fur on their bodies and bulbous, striped tail sections. Despite the uniformity of their appearance, it usually requires an expert eye to tell the difference between a normal honey bee and a dangerous killer bee."

You may also have a city, county, or state beekeeper association\u2014many beekeepers will remove the hive without charge.

Scott McCombe\t\t\tPest Control Specialist\t\t\t\tDid You Know? Killer bees are a hybrid of African and European species that escaped from Brazil in the 1950s. Since then, they've migrated north and since the late 1980s, they have spread across the southern U.S., including California, Arizona, Nevada, Texas, Louisiana, and Florida. Fortunately, they don't appear to be able to move further north because they can't tolerate colder temperatures."

          "description":"If you decide to tackle your bee problem on your own, you\u2019ll need to cover all exposed parts of your body to protect yourself from stings. Layer thick, long-sleeved clothing with work boots, gloves and eye and face protection to minimize your risk of being stung. Getting stung multiple times can prove fatal, so don\u2019t put yourself at unnecessary risk. Killer bee venom is no stronger than that of common varieties of honey bee, but they tend to swarm in overwhelming numbers and are much more easily provoked. Avoid wearing strong fragrances or causing a commotion when preparing to raid a killer bee nest. Unusual stimuli may draw their attention and incite them to swarm."

Adding soap will cause a higher concentration of water to stick to the bees and infiltrate their orifices, effectively drowning them. Natural pesticide mixtures like soap and water provide a welcome alternative to using chemical agents that can harm other species and damage the environment."

The soap and water solution may take longer than a chemical pesticide to show signs that it\u2019s working, but its effects should be similar. After you\u2019ve found the nest, flood any openings in its surface with soapy water to drown out bees hiding within. Using a liquid spraying system in place of a spray bottle might make it easier to reach nests that are built deep inside narrow openings."

Most Africanized honey bees make their nests in ordinary enclosed spaces, but construct fibrous networks inside known as \"combs,\" where they live, reproduce and manufacture honey. Once most of the bees around the nest have been dealt with, the comb itself can be thrown away, crushed or burnt. When handling a hive or comb, watch out for any bees that might remain inside. Thoroughly rinse the area where the nest was found with a garden hose after it\u2019s been disposed of to eliminate scents that might attract other bees."

Environmental experts recommend against using spray insecticides because of their effects on the environment, but if you need to kill a bunch of bees in a hurry, they will do the trick. Insecticides work on airborne pests like nerve agents, paralyzing the cells of the insect\u2019s body and shutting down the nervous system. Insecticides contain highly toxic chemicals. Always use them in a well-ventilated area when possible and keep your nose and mouth covered to prevent breathing in the spray yourself.

The bees will slow down and their movement will become clumsy and erratic. Continue spraying in short bursts until you\u2019ve eliminated all the bees around the nest. Don\u2019t be too heavy-handed with the insecticide spray. Use enough to neutralize swarming bees, but remember that the more poison you release, the more you\u2019ll have lingering in the air and on surfaces around your home.
