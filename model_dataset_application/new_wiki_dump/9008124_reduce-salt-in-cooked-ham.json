After 20 minutes of baking, remove the ham from the oven and carefully pour off the pan drippings, which will be very salty. To retain moisture, add more glaze or seasonings and place the ham back in the oven. For a larger sized ham, wait an additional five to ten minutes before pouring off the pan drippings."

The acidity of the vinegar will counteract the saltiness and even out the flavour. Pour the vinegar over the ham slowly to cover it evenly. Avoid adding too much vinegar to the ham, which will create a sour flavor."

          "description":"Adding a creamy sauce (e.g., hollandaise sauce) to your ham will help to mask its saltiness. The creamy component will make the dish taste milder and balance out the flavour. Pour the sauce over sliced pieces of ham before serving it."

Add enough honey to coat the ham entirely (approximately 1 cup [250 ml] for a  5 lb/0.5 kg ham). You can also drizzle honey on sliced pieces of ham before serving it."

          "description":"Adding an extra source of fat (e.g., oil or butter) to your ham will add an extra layer of flavour to \"absorb\" the saltiness of the meat. Baste your ham with a basting brush dipped in olive oil or melted butter, coating the entire ham. Be sure to use unsalted butter to avoid adding to the saltiness. For best results, baste the ham halfway through heating it."
