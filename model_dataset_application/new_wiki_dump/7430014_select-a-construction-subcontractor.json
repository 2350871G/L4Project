There are many different types of subcontractors:\nExcavators. They cut, fill, and move the earth so that you can pour a foundation. They also cut trenches for utilities. Septic system installers. They install the septic and leaching systems. Plumbers. They install the water heating and plumbing fixtures. Electricians. They install the wires which are hidden from view. They also install fixtures, devices, and electrical switches. Masons. They can build anything involving blocks or bricks, such as block foundations, retaining walls, and walkways or patios. Framers. They build the shell on top of the foundation using lumber, trusses, and other sheet materials. Roofers. Roofers prepare the roofing surface by preparing the underlay and then installing the roofing material on top. Siding contractors. They install the siding on the outside of the building and can handle exterior trim."

For example, someone in your neighborhood might have had electrical work performed or had a new roof installed. Ask for the name of the person who did the work. If you see a house being built, you can stop in and talk to the contractor. Ask who he or she has working as subcontractors. You can also ask retailers. To find a plumber, ask the retailer that provides supplies to the plumbers in the area. If you are looking for someone to lay tile (a tiler), then ask the tile supplier in your area."
