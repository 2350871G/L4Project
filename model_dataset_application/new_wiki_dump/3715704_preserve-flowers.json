Then tie a couple of long pieces of flavorless dental floss tightly around the bottom of the group of stems. Tie the ends to a hanger so that the flowers hang upside down. This will ensure that the flowers keep their shape and that the stems won\u2019t bend under their weight. If you have a lot of flowers, it\u2019s best to secure them together in groups of 6 or less. The dental floss may not be strong enough to hold the weight of more flowers than this."

Pressing Your Flowers Select a book for pressing. Get the heaviest book you can find that you don\u2019t mind potentially damaging.
