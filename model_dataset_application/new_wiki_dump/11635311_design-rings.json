Just because you\u2019re designing a ring from scratch doesn\u2019t mean that you have to go overboard! Stick with a simple, round band with a high-quality metal and go for a classic stone with a standard shape for a simple look.Tip: Most engagement and wedding rings are pretty simple. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to design a simple ring, but you shouldn\u2019t be worried if your design feels kind of ordinary."

Select your gemstone based on the color, shine, and quality of the stone. Diamonds are considered the most desirable, but amethyst, jade, sapphire, pearl, and peridot are just a few of the colorful options available to you.Tip: Think about the goal of your ring. If it\u2019s for personal use, pick a stone that you personally identify with. A casual gift to a coworker likely merits a cheaper stone, while an engagement ring should probably have a beautiful diamond on it. If your budget is limited, cubic zirconium is a great alternative to diamond. It\u2019s not nearly as expensive; you can get a cubic zirconium for $20-100, while diamonds typically cost thousands of dollars. If you aren\u2019t sure what type of stone you want, go to a jewelry store and look around. Ask the clerk about what kind of stones they have to get an in-person look at different stones. You don\u2019t have to include stones in your ring. You can simply design a unique band if you want."

However, the quality of the stone will play into this price, so balance these 2 considerations based on your personal preferences. If the stone is too big, people may think it\u2019s gaudy and over the top. If the stone is too small, people won\u2019t notice it. A quality stone will cost more, while a cloudier or imperfect gem will save you a bunch of money.Most gemstones are measured in carats or millimeters. Millimeters refer to the physical size, while carats refer to the mass of the stone. A carat is equivalent to 200 milligrams (0.0071 oz). The average carat size for a main stone is 1 carat, while engagement rings tend to measure in closer to 2 carats."

Rose gold, gold, silver, titanium, tungsten, and platinum are the most popular choices, but you can use any material available to your jeweler. Keep in mind, if you\u2019re going with gold, choose a lower carat to minimize the ring\u2019s susceptibility to scratches and damage.Platinum is the most popular choice for engagement and wedding rings; it\u2019s also an extremely durable metal for a ring.

However, bulkier prongs and head types tend to be less luxurious and desirable.Settings come in a variety of different styles. Channel settings line the interior of the ring with metal to reinforce the ring. Filigree settings add a variety of worn stones or metals to the band to make it look vintage. There are other options based on how shiny, reflective, or unique you want the band to look. The most common head type for engagement rings is a basket head, where 4-6 prongs hold the stone in place by its edges. You don\u2019t have to include a setting.
