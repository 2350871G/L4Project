          "description":"The ankle wrap method for lacing up flats is simple and only requires that the straps wrap around your ankle multiple times. To start, put your lace-up straps on both feet and tighten the straps or laces around your feet. Tighten the straps around your feet such that they\u2019ll stay on your feet, but not cut off any circulation or cause marks to be left on your feet."

          "description":"Start with your right shoe. Hold a strap in each hand and pull them towards the front of your ankle. Cross the right strap over the left and exchange the straps in your hands. Pull the straps around to the back of your ankle and cross them over one another again. Different lace-up flats will have different lace configurations. Most tend to have the straps at the back of the flat, behind your ankle."

          "description":"Continue wrapping the straps around your right ankle until there\u2019s only about 3 inches (7.6 cm) to 4 inches (10 cm) left. Tie the remaining portions of the straps into a bow. Tie the straps tight enough to keep them in place. Since the straps are around your ankle, there is nowhere for them to fall if they\u2019re too loose. Therefore, don\u2019t tie them so tight you cut off circulation or prevent your foot from being able to flex."

Make sure to tie the straps from both flats at the same location on both of your ankles (e.g., at the front or at the back). Once both of your lace-up flats are on and tied, test the tightness of the straps by walking around your room. If you find the straps too tight, un-tie and re-do the wrapping process."

For this wrap, you want the straps to go halfway up your lower legs. The straps should be tied around the thickest part of your calf.

Continue wrapping until you have about 3 inches (7.6 cm) to 4 inches (10 cm) left of the strap. Once the straps have reached the middle of your lower leg, stop angling the straps upwards. Instead, if you have enough, continue to wrap the straps around the middle of your lower leg."
