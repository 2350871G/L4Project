          "description":"Turn the oven on to the \u201cbake\u201d setting. If your cantaloupe is still a lighter yellow and doesn\u2019t have a smell, the melon is unripe and a higher temperature is ideal for cooking it. If your cantaloupe smells sweet, this means that it\u2019s ripe, so lower the temperature to 375 \u00b0F (191 \u00b0C) and cook for the same amount of time to prevent the melon from becoming too shriveled in the oven. You can begin preparing the cantaloupe as the oven heats to the right temperature."

Then, take a sharp knife and cut it through the center to expose the seeds. It doesn\u2019t matter which direction you cut through the melon, as long as you go through the center to make 2 halves."

Use the spoon and your hands to pull the seeds and the \u201cnetting\u201d out of the center cavity. The netting is made up of tough fibers that hold the seeds in place. If you\u2019re planning to also roast the seeds, place them in a bowl and put them in the refrigerator while you prepare the rest of the cantaloupe. If you aren\u2019t planning to roast the seeds, you can discard them now."

Keep in mind that the pieces will shrivel up slightly as they caramelize in the oven, so don\u2019t make them too small! It\u2019s best to keep them at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide. It\u2019s safe to keep the skin on the cantaloupe while you roast it, so don\u2019t worry about removing it.Tip: If you want the melon to have a more aesthetically pleasing appearance, try using a melon baller to make pieces that are all the same shape and size."

This will help them caramelize in the oven. If the cantaloupe is already ripe and sweet, you can skip this step since the natural sugars in the melon will be enough to make the pieces caramelize."

Make sure there are no pieces on top of each other, and try to space them out as much as possible so each piece can caramelize in the oven. If you don\u2019t have parchment paper, spray a piece of aluminum foil with canola oil or vegetable oil and place it on the baking sheet."

After 20 minutes, check on the melons to make sure they\u2019re shriveling slightly and becoming caramelized. If they aren\u2019t ready, cook them for an additional 3 minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven once they\u2019re a light brown color. If they\u2019re a darker brown color or have shriveled up a lot, they are likely overcooked, but will still be okay to eat!"

Then carefully scoop the pieces off of the parchment paper and place them in a bowl to serve them. You can store the roasted cantaloupe in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week. After a week, discard the leftover cantaloupe and roast a new batch! Eating Roasted Cantaloupe\nTop a bowl of yogurt or oatmeal with roasted cantaloupe for a healthy breakfast treat. Pair roasted cantaloupe with ice cream or custard if you want a sweet dessert. Garnish a scoop of sorbet with roasted cantaloupe for a healthy, fruity snack."
