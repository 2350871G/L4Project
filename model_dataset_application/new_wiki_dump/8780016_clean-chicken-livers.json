  "text":" Soaking Livers in Cold Water Place the livers in cold water. Fill a glass bowl with cold water \u2013 not as cold as ice water but colder than room temperature. Place the livers in the cold water. If possible, don\u2019t lay them on top of one another. Let the livers soak. You should leave the livers in the cold water for about fifteen minutes.

If you find some of the blood is stubborn, you might have to wet a paper towel and wipe the blood off. Removing Connective Tissue Lay out the livers. Lay out all of the livers you\u2019re trimming so that they are flat. This might require that you unfold the livers, as they often come out of the container balled up. Look for connective tissue. Livers have connective tissue running through them, similar to what you might find on a chicken breast. This tissue is usually white or pink and is stringy. You should also look for any greenish parts on the liver, as these will cause the liver to taste bitter. Trim the meat away from the connective tissue. Using a sharp knife or scissors, trim the meat away from the connective tissue. This might take more than one or two passes with the knife, since each liver can have multiple areas with connective tissue. Buying, Storing, and Cooking Chicken Livers Collect chicken livers from whole chickens. If you are in the habit of buying whole chickens, you'll actually be purchasing livers at the same time. Some chickens have multiple hearts and multiple livers, so you might get more than one per chicken. Don't use livers in giblet gravy - it can give the gravy a bitter taste.
