          "description":"The rim is the most fragile part of the glass, so it\u2019s important to put as little weight as possible on the delicate crystal. Carefully set the flat bottom of the glass onto the cabinet or cupboard shelf, making sure not to bump any other glasses. This also prevents any moisture from being trapped inside, such as leftover water from washing."

          "description":"It\u2019s important to make sure to give the glasses enough space so they\u2019re not touching or bumping into each other. This can lead to chipping and cracking, especially if they\u2019ve been stored bowl-down. When you place them in the cabinet, make sure to set them down about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the other glasses."

          "description":"Generally, a cabinet is your best option for storing your stemware long-term. If it isn\u2019t already, make sure that the cabinet is fastened or bolted to the wall and ensure that it has doors with latches so the glasses don\u2019t come tumbling out. If you purchase glasses in bulk, keep them in the boxes until you have enough space in the cabinets to store them."

          "headline":"Lay down some grip-textured liner or mats on the cabinet shelves.",
          "description":"The extra grip will help the glasses can stay upright more easily against shaking or rattling. Purchase a roll of no-slip shelf liner or several individual textured silicone mats, which you can find online or in home improvement stores. Lay them down in the cabinets based on the packaging instructions, making sure not to crease or bunch up the liner or mat material. No-slip shelf liner often has an adhesive side to place against the shelf and hold it in place. Mats may be textured on both sides, which allows them to grip both the cabinet and the bases of the wine glasses."

Make sure to choose and measure a space inside your cabinet for the drawer-style sliding rack, then purchase it from a home improvement store according to your specifications. Choose a material that matches your existing cabinet so it blends nicely."

This prevents dust, dirt, or bugs from collecting inside the bowls and tainting the wine. Purchase an under-the-counter rack online or from a home improvement store. You can quickly attach under-the-cabinet racks with a drill and screws, drilling up into the cabinet to keep the rack secure. However, since the glasses will be displayed in the open, they may collect a fair bit of dust on the outside of the bowl, stem, and base. If this is the case, give them a good rinse before you use them! Wood or metal are the best material options for an under-the-cabinet rack.
