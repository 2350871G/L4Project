If you've ever gone house hunting with an agent, you may have driven up to a house and said, \u201cIt doesn't fit my pictures.\u201d You've already made a decision that the house is not for you based upon its 'curb appeal' and its relationship to other houses in the neighborhood. The buyer who is looking at the pictures of your house also wants to get a sense of your neighborhood, so show them photos of what they'll see when they drive up to your house in the following sequence:\nTake the views of your street looking down it and up it with your house in the middle of the block or area. The buyer can then see exactly what surrounds your house. Take a picture of your house from the house directly across the street to it and include the houses on either side of it for proximity to yours or if your house is privately situated, show what's on either side. Take one from the front door of your house showing what the buyer would see across the street looking out from your front door. Again, include houses if there are any, including empty lots or vegetation. Some buyers need community and some need privacy. Take a closer view showing only your house from the front, then the two sides of the house and finally the back of the house and this point is most important. Buyers want to see themselves entertaining and having fun in the back so take the next picture of the back of the house from the furthest point on your property, so the buyer gets a 'feel' of how big the back side of your property is. The last picture of the outside needs to be taken from the rear of your house sharing what the buyer will see if sitting on the back deck, patio, or sun-room \u2013 regardless if that room is enclosed or open. The buyer must be able to see whatever can be seen as far as the view that can be seen. There's no use hiding a road that's in the back, if you have one there, because the buyer will see it when the house is viewed in person."

Take the pictures with the lights on in the house. Or wait for dusk or a cloudy day when the outside light matches the inside light for best results. Buyers do not like to see dark rooms\nThe kitchen and the master bath need special attention as they are key elements in the buying decision to a woman.

The name of the game is to attract one buyer who wants to buy exactly what your house has to offer them. This will prevent you and your agent from wasting time with buyers with expectations that do not match what you have to offer. Because agents do not identify each picture in text and often take shots of random rooms, thereby confusing buyers, you can easily overcome this problem. Make up large folded card placards or 'tents' of the rooms you have labeled on the blueprint that identifies each room and place them in each picture you take! Put them on tables, chairs, sofas; on prominent pieces of furniture. Remove all personal pictures from every wall and those sitting on pieces of furniture  to make the buyer to be able to see his family living in it, not your family. Put them in the closets, in the attic, out of sight. That includes all the knickknacks and curios on shelves and bookcases. You can put them back after they leave."
