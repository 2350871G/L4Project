          "description":"Design your own stamp by tracing your outline on a foam sheet and then cutting it out with scissors or a utility knife. If the sheet is very thin, place a second piece underneath the first when you cut out the design, and then glue the two together with a hot glue gun. Once you have cut out your design, cut a second or third piece of foam that is slightly larger. Make it square or rectangular, and glue it to your design-piece as backing. This will give you something to grip so you don\u2019t squeeze the design-piece by accident and ruin your stamp."

          "description":"If you want firmer material for your homemade stamp, use a raw potato and cookie cutters. Peel off the skin with a potato peeler. Then slice off a rounded side with a paring knife so you have a nice flat area to use as a stamp. Press your cookie cutter (or any other hard, suitable outline, like the rim of a tin can) into the flat flesh. Then trim away the surrounding flesh from the outline. Once you\u2019re done, place the face of the potato (the area that will be your stamp) onto a paper towel so the moisture is drawn out. Then place it on a new, dry towel to test for any remaining moisture before you begin stamping."

Of course, most lampshades are curved, so with these, use one with a smooth surface to make rounding your stamp easier.

However, if you\u2019re stamping an old one, remove any dust or dirt from the surface, since these may block your paint, create incomplete prints, and/or stick to your stamp.

But if you want to create a more structured look, figure out what pattern you want to follow beforehand. Use tape to form a neat grid or borders for an alternating pattern between rows or columns. Also tape the edgings to protect them in case the stamp overlaps them in your top or bottom row."

Or add one or more shades to the first and stir them on the plate with a plastic spoon or similar tool until they\u2019re evenly mixed. For a more varied look, consider altering the paint\u2019s shade row by row. For example, start with, say, kelly green for the top row. Then mix it with a lighter green for the row below that. As you go down, add more and more white paint to the mix for even paler shades."

Press the wet end lightly into the second plate a couple of time to remove excess paint and avoid any runs or drips on your lampshade. You don\u2019t want any extra paint on your stamp, but you don\u2019t want to remove too much, either. Take a test run first and count how many prints you make on the dry plate before the they start to look incomplete. Depending on the size of your lampshade, you may need several paper plates for this over the course of your project, especially if you are using more than one color or shade."

Use light, even pressure as you do so in order to create a more uniform stamp instead of one that is darker on one side than the other. Also be careful not to grip your stamp too tightly if you are using materials like foam or toilet paper rolls. You don\u2019t want to squeeze or crush it, since this will alter your stamp\u2019s shape. If you are using a foam or premade stamp with intricate designs, test how much pressure you should use on a paper plate before you start on the lampshade. You can also practice your rolling technique on a curved object of similar size, like a plastic bucket."

If you intend to reuse your stamp, clean it immediately with soap and warm water. Then let the stamps on your lampshade dry before handling it again. If your stamps covered the tape on your lampshade, the paint may seal it to the shade as it dries, which could make later removal less neat."
