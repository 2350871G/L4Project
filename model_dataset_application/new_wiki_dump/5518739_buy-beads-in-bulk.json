          "description":"One of the best sources for buying bulk beads is ordering them online. There are numerous online shops that sell bulk beads for cheap prices, because - let's face it - beads aren't that hard or expensive to produce; the hard part is to create masterpieces with them: jewelry, decorations, etc. Online stores and auction sellers will have tons of differently shaped, coloured and sized beads for you to browse through. As an added bonus, it will likely be easy to source related raw materials from the same seller when you're shopping online. Once you've found an an online shop that sells bulk beads, it's often a good idea to create an account. That way the store can keep a track of your last purchases, making it easier for you to remember. Make sure you fill in your personal information correctly so the package reaches you instead of someone else. Some stores may also give you the option of having items registered for delivery, so decide whether the additional expense is worth it for you."

You can recheck the bead choices you've made later, to see which one you actually want to buy in the end. Bead buying can be overwhelming when there are lots of choices!"
