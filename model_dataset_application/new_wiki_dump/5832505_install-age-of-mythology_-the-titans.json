If you don't have the Age of Mythology disc, you have a few options. The easiest is probably to buy and download the \"Extended Edition\" (which includes the base game and the expansion pack) online via Steam. See the section below for help with this. You can also try ordering the disc on online retailers like Amazon, etc. However, since the game is over a decade old, availability may be limited."

It isn't hard to find so-called \"public\" CD keys with a simple search in your preferred search engine.
