  "text":" Forming the frame Place the photograph you want to frame on a flat surface. It must be a vertical photo, as the house frame is tall, not wide. Place the side craft sticks on the lengthwise borders of the photograph. This sets the width. Place a craft stick across the base, where the photograph ends. This forms the house floor. Glue to the two lengthwise craft sticks. Create the roof. Angle two craft sticks at the top to form the gable (triangular part) of the roof. Overlap one craft stick on top of the other, to make a point. Glue in place, both where the point meets, and where the craft sticks meet the lengthwise sticks. Glue the photograph onto the house frame from behind. The glue will go on the front of the photo and on the back of the frame, then press the two together. Decorating and displaying the frame Decorate the craft sticks. Glue sequins around the entire frame. The most effective look is to mix up many colors and the sizes of the sequins. Or, you can keep to one hue if you prefer. Write the name or place of the photo using glitter glue. If the photo is of a person, write the name in; if it's a special place, such as a vacation spot, write the name of that place. Display.
