Alternately, soak the broccoli in vinegar water before cooking it, which will also drive out any insects that may be in it. Rinse the vegetables under cold tap water. You can wash produce with water alone, but using the diluted vinegar method first removes about 98% of surface bacteria. To make rinsing easier, place the broccoli in a colander inside of a clean sink basin. Use the spray setting on your faucet to rinse the vegetables."
