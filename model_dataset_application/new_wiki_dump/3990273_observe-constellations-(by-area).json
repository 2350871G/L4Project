(For example, stars that can be seen in the far northern latitudes cannot be seen in the far southern latitudes, and vice versa, because they do not rise above the horizon.) Some constellations, such as Orion, can be seen across most of the inhabited world. Sky maps look flat to us but that is so that they can fit inside a flat book. In reality, the sky is like a dome."

What you will be able to see when looking in a particular constellation not only depends on your geographic location but also on your equipment and local light pollution. Stars with a magnitude 6.5 and greater can usually be seen with the naked eye or with standard binoculars. You can also look for star clusters, nebulae, differently colored stars and galaxies. Many constellations have been known for thousands of years. In the time of ancient Greece, 48 constellations were noted by Ptolemy, a Greek astronomer."
