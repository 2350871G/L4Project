If you're using goat intestines, carefully slice down the length of the intestines with a sharp knife. Rub down the intestines and innards with lime juice and rinse the innards off with water. Avoid taking care of young children while handling the raw intestines and internal organs. These meats can carry bacteria, so wash and sanitize your hands after handling them."

Boil the internal organs for 5 full minutes. Drain the internal organs into a colander in your kitchen sink. Boiling the innards will kill any bacteria. During this time, you should clean and sanitize your kitchen, especially any equipment that came into contact with the raw internal organs."

Check the meats every 20 to 30 minutes if you're unsure how long you'll need to boil them."

Add the tenderloin and cook it until it browns on all sides. You'll need to stir it frequently so it doesn't stick and burn. Remove the browned tenderloin to a separate bowl.

Add this to your pan and cook the aromatics until they're soft and you can smell them. Stir in the pre-cooked internal organs and entrails (intestines, if you're using them).

The papaitan should be covered with water and you'll want to cook it for 2 to 3 hours. Continue to taste and season the papaitan, adding more bile for a more bitter taste. Make sure that the papaitan doesn't boil or bubble too much. If it boils, the water will cook out and burn the papaitan on the bottom of the pot."

For example, try adding 1/8 teaspoon and taste before adding another 1/8 of a teaspoon of bile. This will keep the dish from becoming too bitter."
