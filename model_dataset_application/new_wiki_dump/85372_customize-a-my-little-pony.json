If this doesn't work try thick sewing thread soaked in acetone to saw at the neck seam. Personally I would never deliberately cut the plastic around the neck area. Older My Little Ponies (G1, G2) are easier to work with, newer versions and knockoffs have stronger glue (G3, g4, Fakies) and you may *have* to cut through the vinyl to get the head off."

You can also try other dyes, even natural ones like coffee or juice. Match your shade to the original color of your pony, if your pony is yellow, blue dye will give you a green pony. Dye the head and body at the same time, or they will not match. You can also dip your pony into different color dyes, or at different levels to make more interesting looks.
