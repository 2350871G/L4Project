          "description":"Prepare for the worst by developing a fire escape plan and making sure everyone in your household knows what to do in case of a fire. Your plan should identify all available exits from each room and routes that lead from the room to a safe, open-air space. Designate a meeting space away from your house, such as a neighbor\u2019s yard or a mailbox across the street. It\u2019s important that your exit routes do not lead to a closed-in area that would prevent escape away from your home, like a gated courtyard. It\u2019s best that any gates or fences can be easily unlocked or unlatched from inside. Make sure everyone in your household knows how to unlock or unlatch any doors, windows, gates, or fences. Routinely inspect any and all of these potential obstacles to be sure they will actually provide a means of escape in the event of a fire. Practice your plan every few months, including at night, which is when fires are most deadly since it\u2019s more difficult to find a safe exit."
