In cooler areas, mangos can still be grown in containers and brought indoors during freezing weather. The Cogshall mango variety is a popular choice for growing indoors, and can be kept permanently at 8 ft (2.4 m) tall with regular pruning. Even smaller dwarf varieties exist for people with limited space."

          "description":"The best way to make sure you get a seed that will grow well in your area is to find a parent tree nearby. A nearby tree that produces good fruit will give you a seed that's the right variety for your climate. If you live in a warm climate with mild winters, you can probably find a healthy mango tree in your area. If you can't find a mango tree, you can order seeds or buy them in a shop. Make sure to choose a variety that is known to grow well where you live. You can also try to plant a seed from a store-bought mango. However, it will be a lot more difficult to make sure the seed stands a chance to survive in your climate, especially if the mango traveled to your grocery store from another state or country. Still, it's worth a try!"

Slice both cheeks off as close as possible to the seed: Place a cheek in the palm of your hand, carefully scoring the flesh side of the cheek, both ways, approximately 2cm/1 inch each way. Then turn the the cheek up, exposing cubes of delicious mango flesh. Eat as is from the skin, or scrape off with a spoon, directly into a bowl. You might want to wear gloves when handling the seed.
