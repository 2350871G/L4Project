          "description":"If you have unused cabinet space in your kitchen, remove the doors and stack books there. If you have a fireplace you don\u2019t use, it can make a unique space to store your reading materials. Alcoves that are designed for vases or paintings can be a great space to stack books vertically. This will make unique features feel consciously used and make your home feel lived-in. A good method for displaying books is to use bookshelves to store most of your books, then use architectural features to display a few smaller sets of books."

          "description":"Coffee table books refer to books that sit on top of tables in common spaces. They\u2019re the first thing that someone will pick up when they start poking around your home, so pick a book or two that represents who you are and what your home is like. If you have a sleek, modern home, a book about abstract art or design will work. If you have an older home, a book about medieval history or fine wine will match your home\u2019s vibe. Coffee table books are typically bigger. Smaller books will look like they\u2019ve just been left at the table unintentionally. Pick colors that don\u2019t clash with, or match, your table. If you have a black table, a white or red book will work. Avoid brown if you\u2019ve got a wood table."

Select books with covers that won\u2019t clash, and place your biggest book on the bottom. Stack your smaller books on top of one another to create a gradual incline. If you\u2019re short on shelf space, this is a good way to use the leftover books. Especially since you\u2019ll use up some of your bigger books creating a stable stand. You can also stack the books and leave nothing on top of them. This will turn your books into a kind of decorative touch, and it\u2019s a good way to give an area some color. Wrap your books in twine to give them a chic look."

Stack books horizontally along your window pane using the frame of the window as your bookends. This is a simple look that will easily give your room a unique look and attitude.

You can also reverse this order to start with your cooler colors for a more modern look. Stick your black books on the very bottom or use them to separate your colors. If you have floating shelves, put one color on each shelf.

Get some tall bookshelves if you\u2019re trying to fill a small wall or have a smaller space. This will keep you from taking up a ton of space with shorter bookshelves. If you have any recessed walls, consider getting bookshelves that fit into the recessed areas perfectly so that the wall becomes flush with your shelves. This will make your room feel bigger, even when you\u2019re actually taking up space. If you\u2019re trying to make a room feel bigger, get white bookshelves instead of black.

Consider enlisting a friend that\u2019s good at building things to help you if you aren\u2019t good at home repair or furniture installation.
