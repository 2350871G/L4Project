Look for raw apple cider vinegar, and make sure to choose pure maple syrup, rather than one that lists dozens of ingredients on the label. Avoid syrup that says \u201cfat free\u201d or \u201csugar free,\u201d as those certainly aren\u2019t pure. Purchase the freshest ginger available. High-quality ingredients may be a bit more expensive, but they will last you awhile. You only use a small amount for this recipe."

If you are using regular water, steeping it with strengthen the flavor, but you can serve it immediately instead if you choose."
