For traditional wreath placement, you will want to place the center of the wreath at eye level, and at the center of the door. Eye level is typically regarded as 57 inches (140 cm).

Different command hooks can support different amounts of weight. Consequently, it is important to know both the weight of your wreath and the maximum capacity of your command hook. Clean the door with rubbing alcohol. Wiping the door with rubbing alcohol and allowing it to evaporate will prepare the surface.

Using an Over the Door Wreath Hanger Open your door. You will need to slide the wreath hanger over your door, something you cannot do if your door is closed.

The more square end should fit snugly against the door frame, while the rounder side (if your over the door wreath hanger has one) will hold the wreath. Slide the wreath hanger over the door. Open your door and slide the top half of the wreath hanger over it. Over the door wreath hangers are an \"S\" shape, where the upper half of the \"S\" fits over the top of your door, and the bottom half will supports the wreath. Close your door. Closing your door will allow you to ensure that your over the door wreath hanger is in a good place and fits well against your door.
