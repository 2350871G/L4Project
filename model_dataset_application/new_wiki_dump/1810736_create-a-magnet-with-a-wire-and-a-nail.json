Now you can use the wire-wrapped part of the nail or screw to pick up things like paperclips, tacks, nails, screws, and other small metal objects. If your mini-electromagnet does not work, then check to ensure that the wires are making close contact with both ends of the battery. If they are loose or not connected, then the electromagnet will not work. Detach the copper wires from the battery when you are done using the magnet. The magnet will become hot if the wires are connected for too long."

Coil the wire around your nail or screw, then connect the wire from one end of the screw to your knife switch. Then, connect the wire from the other end of the nail or screw to the negative pole of one of the D batteries. Next, connect a piece of copper wire between the positive pole of your battery that is connected to the screw and the negative pole of the battery that is not yet connected to anything. Finish the circuit by connecting a wire between the remaining positive pole and the knife switch. Close the knife switch and you should be able to pick up some paperclips or tacks."
