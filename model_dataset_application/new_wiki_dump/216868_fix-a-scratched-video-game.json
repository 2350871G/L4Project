      "description":"There are two main data surfaces on a game disc: the surface plastic, which is the plastic layer on the bottom of the disc, and the aluminum storage, which is the reflective part. If the plastic is lightly scratched, the aluminum part may not read correctly, thus causing errors; you may be able to fix this issue by filling the scratches with a solid solution such as Vaseline. If the aluminum surface is scratched, you cannot repair the disc. This happens when the disc is deeply scratched. Deep, circular scratches cannot be fixed. You'll either have to return the game or buy a new copy."

If the disc is scratched but you haven't encountered any errors while using it, don't attempt to repair it. Disc errors can result due to anything from outdated drivers to incompatible software. Be aware that placing a disc in a console or CD drive which scratched your current disc may also result in the second disc being scratched."
