Combine the salad dressing, hot sauce, and cayenne pepper in a medium bowl. Use a spoon or whisk to thoroughly blend the ingredients together. Remove 1/2 cup of the marinade for basting. Place it in a small, covered bowl and refrigerate. Pour the remaining marinade into a large re-sealable plastic bag. Check the seal on the bag to verify that it closes. Add the chicken to the bag. Reseal the bag and turn the chicken to coat it. Allow the chicken to marinate overnight. Double-check to make sure that the bag is sealed before placing it into the refrigerator. Remove the chicken from the bag after it finishes marinating. Discard the marinade. Heat the grill to medium heat. Set the fire to one side of the grill while leaving a portion of the grill empty. If using a propane grill, turn on half the burners. If using a charcoal grill, pile the briquettes on one side of the grill. Place the wings skin-side down on the non-lit side of the grill. This will cook them using indirect heat. Cover the grill. Cook the wings for 30 minutes, turning occasionally. Add butter to the reserved sauce. Mix the two together in a small bowl using a spoon or whisk. Uncover the grill and baste the wings using a basting brush.  Flip the wings over. Baste this side, as well. Grill uncovered for an additional 10 to 20 minutes, or until juices run clear. Baste and turn several times throughout the cooking process. Place the cooked wings in a large bowl.
