While some disasters, such as fire, can happen anywhere, the hazards you might encounter vary widely from place to place. Check with your local emergency management or civil defense office, Red Cross chapter, or the National Weather Service to get an idea of what emergencies you should prepare for."

They may be able to provide you with evacuation maps and information about local warning systems and emergency plans. If you can't get all the information you need from officials, research your local hazards on your own. Figure out, for example, what preparations you should make for a tornado or hurricane and how to survive if you're caught in a disaster, and determine the best evacuation routes on your own if need be. Remember, when push comes to shove, it's your responsibility to ensure your family is well prepared."

Choose a spot that will likely be safe and that is well away from your neighborhood, as you might not be able to make it back to your home."

          "description":"Designate a friend or relative as a contact person that you, your spouse, and your children can call if you can't meet up. In order to minimize the chance that the contact person will also be affected by the disaster, choose someone who lives in a distant town or in a different state.

Here are just a few examples:\nEvery home should have smoke detectors and fire extinguishers. Test smoke detectors at least once a month, and replace their batteries yearly or as needed. Fire extinguishers should be recharged according to the manufacturer's instructions, and family members should learn how to use them. Everyone should also know how to escape the house in the event of a fire. If you live in an area prone to earthquakes, you wouldn't want a tall, heavy bookcase sitting right next to the baby's crib, as it could be knocked over in a quake. If you live near woods with the possibility of forest fires, you should clear your property of brush and high grass to create a buffer zone between your home and the fire."

Adults and older children should know how to turn off gas, electricity and water if the house is damaged, and everyone should know how to detect a gas leak. Emergency numbers should be posted near phones, and even small children should be taught how to call 9-1-1 or the corresponding emergency number in your country. Practicing how to use a fire extinguisher and checking smoke detectors are great reminder exercises to do once a year."

During a flood, you may be surrounded by water, but that water will be unsanitary and unsafe to drink. You also may not have access to drinking water. Plan on having one gallon (3.785 liters) per person per day. This includes drinking, food preparation, and sanitation water. Store your emergency water in clean, non-corrosive, tightly sealed containers. Keep the containers in a cool, dark place. Don't store them in sunlight or near gasoline, kerosene, pesticides, and other similar substances."

Plan on checking your first aid kit once a year, along with the rest of your emergency supplies. If you come across anything that has expired, replace it. Your first aid kit should include an assortment of the following:\nAbsorbent compress dressings and an instant cold compress\nAdhesive bandages, triangular bandages, roller bandages, sterile gauze pads, and adhesive cloth tape\nAntibiotic ointment packets, hydrocortisone ointment packets, antiseptic wipe packets, and a few packets of aspirin\nA pair of non-latex gloves, scissors, tweezers, and a non-glass, non-mercury oral thermometer\nPersonal and prescription medications\n\nA first aid instruction booklet and a list of emergency phone numbers, including contact information for your doctor, local emergency services, emergency road service providers, and the poison help line."

Try to find at least two ways to get out of each room. Drawing a floor plan of your house and marking the exits can help you remember exactly what to do in the event of a fire.

Smoke and heat rise, so it will always be safer and easier to breathe as close to the ground as possible. Here are some measures that you should take:\nPractice crawling to avoid getting smoke in your eyes and lungs. Practice stopping, dropping, and rolling to stomp out any fire on your clothes. Practice touching a door with the back of your hand to know if there's fire on the other side. Start from the bottom of the door and work your way to the top, as heat rises. If the door is hot during a real fire, stay away. Practice sealing yourself in your home if you cannot escape. If you have no way to get out, then you should close all doors that are between you and the fire. It will take 20 minutes for the door to burn. Never seal the doors with duct tape or towels. Practice waving a flashlight or light-colored cloth out the window to let the fire department know where you are. Memorize the phone numbers to the Emergency Services. You will need to call them during a real fire."

Learn how to work the ladders for your drill so you'll be prepared to use them in the event of an emergency.

There are three types of fire extinguishers intended for home use: Class A, Class B, and Class C. It is also possible to buy a combination fire extinguisher as well, such as Class B-C or Class A-B-C. You can get them at most home improvement stores. A Class A fire extinguisher is intended for ordinary materials like cloth, wood and paper. A Class B fire extinguisher is meant for combustible and flammable liquids like grease, gasoline, oil and oil-based paints. A Class C fire extinguisher will put out electrical fires, caused by appliances, tools, and other equipment."

This can be your neighbor's front lawn, your mailbox, or a light post. Everyone should meet at this spot once they've escaped so you know that everyone has made it safely once you do a headcount.

Practicing the drill with your children may also help them the dangers of fire, and make them less likely to play with it. Children should practice the escape routes with an adult so that they don't attempt anything dangerous, like escaping from a second-story window. Children should always be paired with an adult during the escape plan so they aren't alone."

You should also make sure that your street number is visible from the road, a minimum of 3 inches in height, and a contrasting color. This way, the firemen find your home easily, and get to it as quickly as possible. It would be even better if you had a smoke detector outside each bedroom door in the hallway as well as in each stairway. Remember to replace batteries in the smoke detector every year. It would be a good idea to test the smoke detector during this time as well, to ensure that it is functioning properly. If your doors or windows have security bars, they should have emergency release levers so they can be opened right away. Make sure that every family member sleeps with their bedroom door closed. It takes 20 to 30 minutes for a door to burn, which can provide valuable escape time."

What will you do if everyone in your family is spread out across the city? Having as many plans as possible can help you find the best methods of escape.

You should also gather your outdoor possessions, such as trash cans, grills, and lawn furniture, and tie them down securely. Lastly, you should turn off all of the utilities if it looks like you need to evacuate. Here are some other things you should do, in case you are forced to evacuate or stay:\nFill your water containers with enough drinking water to last you 10 to 30 days. Fresh water may become unavailable for long periods of time, and you may not be able to get to the store to buy some. Sanitize your sinks and tubs and then fill them with clean water so you have them on hand. This way, if you are stranded and the water is shut off, you will have fresh water on hand. Flood water is not sanitary. Fill your car's tank with gas and put your emergency kit in your car. If you don't have a car, then make arrangements for transportation. Put your important documents, such as medical records, your insurance cards, and your ID cards, in a waterproof bag. Find a shelter where you can put your pet, if you have one.

Your family should know what to do if you have to evacuate because of a flood and should be prepared to act. Here are some tips to follow before and when you evacuate:\nTake only the most important items with you. Turn off your gas, electricity, and water, if there's time. Disconnect your appliances. Follow the evacuation routes given to you by the authorities. Don't walk across highly flooded areas. Continue listening to the radio for updates. Head to a shelter or a friend's home.

You should also buy a Class A, B, or C fire extinguisher, and ensure that all of your family members know how to use it. You should also buy and install sump pumps with back-up power in case you need it. Here are some other things you should do to prepare your home:\nInstall backflow valves or plugs in your drains, toilets, and any other sewer connections to keep the flood waters out. Anchor the fuel tanks in your garage to the ground. If the tanks are torn free, they can be swept downstream and will cause damage to other houses. If they are in your basement, then you don't need to anchor them. Download your electrical panel by turning off one breaker at a time. Turn the main one off last, to avoid a large electrical arch."

It would be even better if you had a smoke detector outside each bedroom door in the hallway as well as in each stairway. Remember to replace batteries in the smoke detector every year. It would be a good idea to test the smoke detector during this time as well, to ensure that it is functioning properly. If your doors or windows have security bars, they should have emergency release levers so they can be opened right away. Make sure that every family member sleeps with their bedroom door closed. It takes 20 to 30 minutes for a door to burn, which can provide valuable escape time. Making a Family Flood Plan Contact the county planning department to learn about your community's emergency plans for floods. The department will tell you if you are in an area that is prone to flash floods or landslides; it's important to know what to expect before you begin planning. You can also find out the warning signals, evacuation routes, and locations of emergency shelters that are used in your community. This will influence your family's flood plan. Make an escape plan in the event of a flood. You and your family need to discuss what you will do to escape if there is a flood in your community. What will you do if everyone in your family is at home? What will you do if everyone in your family is spread out across the city? Having as many plans as possible can help you find the best methods of escape. Having an out-of-state relative or friend as your contact person in case your family is separated increases your chances of being reunited. Everyone in your household should know the name, address, and phone number of this person. Ensure that your family knows what to do if you are under a flood watch or warning. If you are under flood watch or warning, then your family should be prepared to gather your emergency supplies and to listen to the local radio or TV station for updates on what to do. You should also gather your outdoor possessions, such as trash cans, grills, and lawn furniture, and tie them down securely. Lastly, you should turn off all of the utilities if it looks like you need to evacuate. Here are some other things you should do, in case you are forced to evacuate or stay:\nFill your water containers with enough drinking water to last you 10 to 30 days. Fresh water may become unavailable for long periods of time, and you may not be able to get to the store to buy some. Sanitize your sinks and tubs and then fill them with clean water so you have them on hand. This way, if you are stranded and the water is shut off, you will have fresh water on hand. Flood water is not sanitary. Fill your car's tank with gas and put your emergency kit in your car. If you don't have a car, then make arrangements for transportation. Put your important documents, such as medical records, your insurance cards, and your ID cards, in a waterproof bag. Find a shelter where you can put your pet, if you have one. Make sure that you have a leash/crate/carrier, extra food, medications (if needed) and shot records. Keep an ear out for disaster sirens and signals. Know what to do if you have to evacuate. If you are given an evacuation order, then you should listen and get out of your home as soon as you can. Trust that the authorities know what they're doing and that you'll be out of harm's way once you leave. Your family should know what to do if you have to evacuate because of a flood and should be prepared to act. Here are some tips to follow before and when you evacuate:\nTake only the most important items with you. Turn off your gas, electricity, and water, if there's time. Disconnect your appliances. Follow the evacuation routes given to you by the authorities. Don't walk across highly flooded areas. Continue listening to the radio for updates. Head to a shelter or a friend's home. Make sure that this friend does not live in an area where evacuation is mandatory. Prepare your home for flood safety. Prepare to turn off any electrical power in your home before you leave. If there is standing water or fallen power lines nearby, then you should turn off your gas and water to avoid electrical shock when the power comes back on. You should also buy a Class A, B, or C fire extinguisher, and ensure that all of your family members know how to use it. You should also buy and install sump pumps with back-up power in case you need it. Here are some other things you should do to prepare your home:\nInstall backflow valves or plugs in your drains, toilets, and any other sewer connections to keep the flood waters out. Anchor the fuel tanks in your garage to the ground. If the tanks are torn free, they can be swept downstream and will cause damage to other houses. If they are in your basement, then you don't need to anchor them. Download your electrical panel by turning off one breaker at a time. Turn the main one off last, to avoid a large electrical arch. Stock your home with emergency supplies. If you really want to prepare your family for a flood, then you should be prepared with several key items that will increase your chances of safety and survival. Here are some of the items you will need to pack:\nEnough containers to hold three to five days worth of water supply\nA three to five day supply of non-perishable food and a mechanical can opener\nA first aid kit\nA battery-powered radio\nFlashlights\nSleeping bags and blankets\nBaby wipes for cleaning your hands\nChlorine or iodine tablets for purifying water\nSoap, toothpaste, and other hygienic supplies\nAn emergency kit for your car that includes maps, booster cables, and flares\nRubber boots and waterproof gloves",
