          "description":"Residents and citizens in the US need to follow a certain protocol when flying the flag. If you are displaying more than one flag outside, you need to keep the US flag at the top, or if they\u2019re in a line, it should be in the middle and raised to the highest point. Check out https://www.va.gov/opa/publications/celebrate/flagdisplay.pdf for more specifics. In addition to keeping the US flag above all others, you also need to be careful to never let it touch the ground. Never display a company or branded flag on the same pole with the US flag. You can display other country or state flags, but company flags are considered \u201cadvertising.\u201d"

It\u2019s also a little sturdier than hanging a flag from a pole attached to your house. Choose a fiberglass or standard aluminum pole for lightweight, easy to install options.
