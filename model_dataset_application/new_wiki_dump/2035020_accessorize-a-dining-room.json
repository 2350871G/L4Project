However, having too much furniture crammed into your dining room will make it hard to enjoy the space, and it will look cluttered. Take a measurement of the walls and write them down or type them into your phone. Take photos of the space to reference while you shop. Create to-scale paper or cardboard versions of the furniture and lay them out in the room so you can see how much space each piece will take up. You can also try out different layouts to see which configuration you like best."

If you pulled out inspiration photos, bring those as well. This will help you know what pieces you\u2019re interested in buying for your space. You can choose to buy a set or mix-and-match different pieces for a unique and affordable option. Look for sturdy pieces if you use your furniture a lot. For example, if you use your dining table for homework sessions and work as well as for eating all of your meals, then invest in hardy pieces.
