Having a license proves that the company has met the minimum standards required to provide their services in the region."

      "description":"Some companies strip their jobs back to the absolute minimum so they can come in at the lowest price, but the work won't last the longest possible time. Ask the company that is more expensive why their price is at that level, so you can determine if there is a difference."

      "description":"Some plumbers prefer to provide quotes only when they are in front of the job so they get it exactly and 100% right. From a plumber's and customer's perspective, there's nothing worse than saying it will cost $X to fix and get to the home, only to find that its really $Y because of some complicating factor."

This is unlike many online reviews, usually written by people who work for the company or have been paid to write fake glowing reviews."
