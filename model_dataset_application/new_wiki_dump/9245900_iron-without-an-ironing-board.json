Cover the board in heat-resistant fabric, such as linen or canvas, and staple it to the bottom. Then, simply lay it on a sturdy surface before ironing on it.

Close the bathroom door to keep the steam in. When you get out of the shower, pull the fabric tight to ensure it is wrinkle-free and ready to wear.
