      "description":"Blackcurrants feed well and need a nutritious soil. Till the soil and add blood and bone or potash and nitrogen in the early spring. The soil needs to be well-drained, light, and kept moist. Blackcurrants are more forgiving on less nutritious soil than other berries but produce the best fruit when well fed."

      "headline":"Plant the blackcurrant.",
      "description":"Fruit is borne on the length of the previous year's spring growth, by sending up shoots from under the round yearly. When planting, bury the blackcurrant stem about 5 centimeter (2.0 in) deeper than it was positioned in the container you purchased it in."

      "headline":"Harvest.",
      "description":"Don't pick the blackcurrants too soon. Once ripened, leave the berries to hang on the bush a few extra days to improve the flavour. When you see some of the upper level berries fall off unaided, the blackcurrants are ready for harvesting."

      "headline":"Prune.",
      "description":"Each bush should carry around 6 to 10 shoots. Remove the oldest canes post-harvest yearly. This will stimulate the new growth. Pruning off the oldest canes will renew the entire bush about every three years."
