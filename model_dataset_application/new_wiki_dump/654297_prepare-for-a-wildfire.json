          "headline":"Create a 30-foot safety zone around the house.",
          "description":"All vegetation is fuel for a wildfire, though some trees and shrubs are more flammable than others. To reduce the risk, you will need to modify or eliminate brush, trees and other vegetation near your home. The greater the distance is between your home and the vegetation, the greater the protection. If you live on a hill, extend the zone on the downhill side. Fire spreads rapidly uphill. The steeper the slope, the more open space you will need to protect your home. Swimming pools and patios can be a safety zone and stone walls can act as heat shields and deflect flames. In this zone, you should also do the following:\nRemove vines from the walls of the house. Move shrubs and other landscaping away from the sides of the house. Prune branches and shrubs within 15 feet (4.6 m) of chimneys and stove pipes. Remove tree limbs within 15 feet (4.6 m) of the ground. Thin a 15-foot space between tree crowns. Replace highly flammable vegetation such as pine, eucalyptus, junipers and fir trees with lower growing, less flammable species. Check with your local fire department or garden store for suggestions. Replace vegetation that has living or dead branches from the ground-level up (these act as ladder fuels for the approaching fire). Mow your lawn often. Keeping the grass at a maximum of 2 inches (5.1 cm) is ideal. Watch grass and other vegetation near the driveway, as gas and exhaust from your automobile can cause it to ignite easily. Clear the area of leaves, brush, evergreen cones, dead limbs, and fallen trees."
