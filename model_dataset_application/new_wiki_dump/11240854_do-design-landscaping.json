          "headline":"Sketch out a rough design idea with different spaces.",
          "description":"Think of the different spaces in your landscape as rooms. Each \"room\" serves a purpose, like recreation, relaxation, or decoration. In each of these areas, list some of the plants, furniture, or decor that will contribute to that purpose. As an example, you can use a pergola as an outdoor dining space or a patio for entertaining. Or, for a more simple division, use a path or garden bed to divide your yard into different spaces. Also think about how you will create transitions between these spaces. Use paths and create openings so that people can move between the different \"rooms\" in your landscape. You can use tall plants to create a tunnel that leads from one area to another, or try creating a winding path to encourage people to wander through your garden, rather than a straight path from point A to point B."

          "description":"In order to define spaces more clearly and get a little bit of privacy, add fencing around your yard or part of your yard. A fun and cheap DIY solution is to use shipping pallets. Small businesses often give shipping pallets away for free, so this could be a very low-cost option. Stand the pallets upright and line them up evenly. Then bolt them together using 3\" bolts or roofing nails.For extra stability, buy stakes to drive into the ground. Either slide the pallets over the stakes, or bolt them together. Customize your fence by painting it, adding a door, or installing planters along the top. If you need a fence to keep animals out or in of your landscape, try a high wire fence. Check where your property lines are before building a fence around your yard."

          "headline":"Create walkways between different sections of your landscape.",
          "description":"For a quick, easy solution, create a gravel walkway by digging a shallow path, installing edges, adding and compacting a crushed stone base, and then filling the rest with gravel. For a more involved project, try installing a brick or stone pathway. Walkways cut down on the amount of yard you will need to take care of, and help prevent damage to your grass. They also add visual interest to your yard and encourage people to walk through your garden."

          "description":"Raised planters help contain greenery and help keep pests out of your garden. Try stacking stone pavers to create a rustic garden wall. Or, build a simple four-sided wooden garden bed using cedar boards and a few screws. Garden beds can be as large or as small as you want. Build them based on the size of the plants you want inside, when they are fully grown."

          "headline":"Add a patio to create an outdoor room for entertaining.",
          "description":"The process of installing a patio is very similar to installing a walkway. Measure the space you would like to use for your patio, so that you know exactly how much material you will need. Then, dig a ditch a few inches deep and the size you would like your patio to be. Reinforce the edges with steel or plastic. Then, add a layer of paver sand. Finally, add a layer of pavers, brick, or concrete tiles. Set the pavers with a compactor, and seal them to keep them in like-new condition. Add furniture to your patio to bring it to life."

For example, if you live in zone 3, consider crabapple trees, bayberry and juniper shrubs, and honeysuckle vines when creating your plans. If you live in zone 10, look at more tropical plants like eucalyptus, rubber plant, and palm trees. While your plant hardiness zone can give you an idea of what kinds of plants will do well in your area, it isn't perfect.

Full sun-loving plants (6-8 hours of direct sunshine every day) include bulbine, coneflowers, pavonia, and verbena. Plants that do well in partial shade (3-6 hours of sunshine a day) include foxglove, Japanese forest grass, and pulmonaria. Ferns, grasses, and hosta do well in fully shaded areas. If you aren't sure what kinds of plants will do well in your area, look for plants native to your region. Avoid planting in deep shade, where there is no light at all.

It can take some practice to find the right balance between repeating these elements and introducing new ones. To play it safe, stick with more repetition. Too many new elements can look chaotic. Tall grass makes a pretty filler and creates a sense of cohesion in your garden if you are using a lot of different kinds of plants. Keep the purpose of your space in mind when deciding on a theme. For example, in a zen garden, use a reflecting pool and water lilies as a focal point. Choose plants and furniture that will complement that."

          "headline":"Use temporary solutions while waiting for plans to fill out.",
          "description":"If your master plan calls for large plants that are taking a while to grow or you haven't gotten around to installing a walkway, bring in some temporary annuals or ground covers in the meantime. This will look more intentional and make your yard look less bare. If you like the way your temporary plants look but think they are in the wrong place for your master plan, you can try moving them elsewhere in your yard."
