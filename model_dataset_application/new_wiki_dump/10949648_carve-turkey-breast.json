Cut through any strings holding the legs together with the tip of a sharp knife. A sharp chef\u2019s knife will be most useful for separating the turkey breast from everything else smoothly and easily.

Slice through the joints with a sharp knife and set the legs and thighs aside. You can separate the thigh from the drumstick at this point by cutting through the joint that connects them if you want to carve up the thigh later as well. The knife should be big enough to slice all the way through in 1 slice."

Use the tip of your knife to help cut it free from the meat if you can\u2019t pull it out right away. The wishbone is the \u201cY\u201d shaped collar bone at the front of the breast. Removing the wishbone will make the turkey breast much easier to carve."

Repeat this for the other wing to finish preparing the turkey breast for carving. You can leave the wings intact to be eaten whole. They are the crispiest and least meaty part of a whole turkey."
