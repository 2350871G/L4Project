The best approach is to refrigerate melons in perforated bags to keep them moist without letting them dry out. Buy perforated plastic bags or make one by poking about 20 small holes in an ordinary bag with a pen or hole punch. Buy perforated plastic bags at grocery stores, department stores, or online."
