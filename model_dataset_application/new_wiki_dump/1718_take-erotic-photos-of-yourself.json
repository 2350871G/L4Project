          "description":"Being nude isn't a requirement for an erotic photo, but if it's something you'd like to try, then go for it! If you want to take a nude photo but are nervous, try starting out with some clothes on and gradually remove them as you're taking photos to work yourself up to it. You can pose as much as you want, or simply take a selfie as you get out of the shower. No matter your size, you can take a nude photo. Be confident and take time to appreciate the beauty of your body\u2014it'll reflect in your photo."

          "headline":"Apply makeup to give yourself a more dramatic look.",
          "description":"Use a slightly heavier hand than usual to make sure your features stand out in a two-dimensional setting. For classically sexy, pinup-style makeup, try false eyelashes, black eyeliner, and bright red lipstick. Use foundation to even out your skin tone and cover any blemishes. If you prefer a more natural style, that can also be really sexy. Use light eyeliner and mascara to define your eyes, and put on some lipgloss to make your lips look a little more plump.Tip: If you don't plan on including your face in your photo, then you don't need to worry about doing your makeup."

          "headline":"Style your hair so it's voluminous and sexy.",
          "description":"Tousle your hair for a suggestive bed-head look that implies a recent roll in the hay. Tease already-dry hair with back-combing and hairspray, or you could wash and blow dry your hair, applying a root-lifter or mousse around your scalp. The tousled look is a great one to emulate for both feminine and masculine styles. If you want to take a sexy photo of yourself in the bath, try making a messy bun with your hair to keep it out of the water. If you just want to take a quick selfie to send to someone else, you definitely don't have to take tons of time to get prepared. Just try to tame any flyaway hairs, make sure there is nothing stuck in your teeth, and snap away!"

        {
          "headline":"Pluck, trim, and shave away stray hairs that you don't want in the photo.",
          "description":"This depends entirely on what kind of photo you want to take\u2014if you're focusing mainly on your face, you may not need to shave your legs or trim your bikini line. Just how plucked you want to be is completely up to you! Decide what makes you feel the best and go with that. If you love the all-natural look and don't want to shave any body hair, you don't have to. For men, having a beard or some facial stubble can be a really sexy look; just make sure you're well-groomed before snapping a photo."

          "description":"A photo can be erotic even when you're clothed (and sometimes wearing something sexy can be even more alluring than being in the nude). If you do decide to wear some sexy garments, remember that the goal is to tease, intrigue, and highlight your best qualities. Just make sure that whatever you choose fits you well and is in good shape. For men, try wearing a button-up shirt and undoing several of the top buttons to show off your chest. Or put on a tank top that highlights your arm and shoulder muscles. Lingerie like bustiers, negligees, slips, stocking, and garters are all fun options. Lace bras, push-up bras, and other styles can accentuate your cleavage in a really attractive way. Steer clear of baggy or worn-out underwear. Opt for thongs, boyshorts, or a bikini-cut style. Add a few accessories to your ensemble, like high heels, oversized button-up shirts, men's ties, long necklaces, scarves, glasses, or whatever else strikes your fancy."

          "description":"Don't feel like you have to restrict your photo location to the bedroom or bathroom (though you can get some great shots while laying in bed or coming out of the shower). Using a couch or plush chair or posing against a plain wall can produce some great pictures, especially if the lighting is right. You can even take a sexy pic while you're out in public. Just find a nice backdrop and pose while you snap a selfie."

          "description":"Make sure you're the star of the photo by removing any distractions from the area where you plan to take your shots. Remove clutter, get rid of any loud wall hangings, and clear out anything else that doesn't fit the look you want. For example, if you're taking a photo on your bed, clear off your nightstand and make sure any closets or drawers are shut. If you're in the bathroom, clear off the counter completely and remove any wet towels that might be hanging up.Tip: Take a photo of the area you're planning to use (without you in it) so you can see what the space really looks like. Examine the space and make any adjustments to the placement of furniture, clean anything that's dirty, and remove clutter from the frame."

          "description":"A lot of erotic photos utilize a mirror so that you can capture certain angles, and an otherwise beautiful photo can be made less so if the mirror is covered in spots and streaks. Take a few minutes to wipe down the mirror with glass cleaner and a lint-free towel so that your photos will be (literally) spotless. Make sure your camera lens is also clean. Whether you're using an actual camera or the camera function on your phone, a grimy lens can really affect the quality of your photos."

          "headline":"Opt for natural lighting when you can for the most alluring photos.",
          "description":"Sunlight is the best light to use to take photos of yourself because it softens you and makes you look more natural. So while it may seem counterintuitive, schedule your erotic-photo session for midday if you can. Open up the blinds to let in natural light; just be careful if there are people outside that they can't see you, especially if you're nude. If you can't use natural light, opt for lamps rather than overhead lighting for a softer glow to your photos. If the glare is too strong, throw a sheer scarf over the lamp to mute its brightness."

But regardless of whether you're using your phone or an actual camera, knowing how to set a delay and how to change the focus will make your photo-taking experience a lot simpler. Most phone cameras have filters you can apply to your photos, which can be a fun way to quickly edit a photo before you send it off to someone. If you're interested in taking photos from some unusual angles, invest in a tripod for your phone (they cost about $15).

If you're alone, you won't have to worry about being interrupted, and you'll be able to relax and enjoy yourself more. If you can't be in a totally empty home, then make sure to lock your bedroom door before you start snapping those erotic photos. Keep your pets out of the room while you're snapping your pics.

Take a look at yourself in the mirror and affirm the things you like about yourself. If you're tense or uncomfortable, that will reflect in your photos. If you do have a drink, avoid having too many before you start taking photos! You want to be relaxed, but you don't want your eyes to be glazed over from accidentally imbibing too much."

But a lot of this is just smart photography that accentuates your best features. Remember that you don't have to just focus on your chest, legs, curves, six-pack abs, or toned arms. Take a look at yourself in the mirror and think about which part of your body you love the most, is most unique, or that you're most proud of. If you're snapping a selfie, try taking a photo from up above your head so that you're looking up at the camera\u2014this will elongate your face and give you the opportunity to include a downward shot of your body, too. Take a photo over your shoulder of your backside in a mirror. Whether you want to show off your back muscles or your curves, this is a great way to highlight your posterior."

It may take a little time before you find a pose you absolutely love. Try out some of these poses and angles to get started:\nMake the S-curve. Arch your back as much as possible so that your breasts are pushed forward and your butt is pushed back. This will accentuate your curves and imitate an hourglass shape. Keep your chin up. Raise your chin a little bit more than you think you need to. It'll make your neck look longer and slimmer, and you'll avoid creating weird shadows over your collarbones. Throw your shoulders back. As with arching your back, this posture helps to push your breasts forward. Try holding your phone out to the side instead of right in front of you when you take a selfie. This will give you a sexier, more mysterious look. Get on your bed on your stomach and take a selfie from that position to include your chest, curves, legs, or whichever other part of your body you want to accentuate."

Turn your face to the side to optimize on shadows to create a more dramatic look.Tip: For a sultry look, keep your lips slightly parted so you can gently breathe through them. This will look sexier than keeping them closed."
