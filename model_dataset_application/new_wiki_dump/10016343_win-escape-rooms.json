          "description":"For instance, you should use the restroom before getting sent into the room. The only way you can leave a room is if you call for a staff to come get you, and then you usually cannot go back in. Also, do not try to take pictures or video during the game; this is usually explicitly against the rules and can get your team disqualified. Listen carefully to your guide about game rules and what can get you disqualified. For people who are uncomfortable about being physically trapped in a room, the reality is that you aren\u2019t. The doors do not actually physically lock you in, and you can leave at any time. However, to avoid getting your team disqualified, you have to call for a staff to escort you out instead of just walking out of your room."

Try to wait 10 minutes to ask for your first clue, but if you are all completely lost before then, you can ask for it sooner. When you ask for a clue, the answer you\u2019re given will help you at the specific point you are at in the game, so listen carefully. Escape rooms generally work in steps, with a first puzzle to solve that leads to a new puzzle, etc. Clues from the guide will help you solve whatever step it is that you\u2019re currently stuck on."

          "description":"A good rule of thumb is to yell out what you find as soon as you find it. This can seem chaotic at first, but as you get to know the room, knowing what everyone has found will help each of you start to make sense of what puzzles you need to solve and the clues to solve them. Listen to a teammate if they think they have started solving a puzzle. Think about what you have found, or have heard other teammates find, that can help solve that puzzle."

Stay focused on the room, the clues, and working together with your team. Remember that this is a game and the goal, besides escaping the room, is to have fun. Relax and have fun while you make observations and guesses to help your team reach the common goal."

You\u2019ll make better use of your time by going to a different puzzle or clue and focusing on solving that. Spreading out is especially helpful in the beginning of the game.

If a few different people can\u2019t figure it out, that may be a sign that you need more information to solve it, or a hint from your guide. Passing around items you can\u2019t solve ensures that puzzles don\u2019t get forgotten about; forgetting about a puzzle until the last minute can make your team think they are farther ahead than they really are."

For instance, books or pictures that seem related, keys, or other similar loose objects should be placed together in a central location of the room. It is helpful to keep a running list of objects and where they were originally located.

Keep in mind that in some rooms, objects can be used more than once, but organizing objects in this way will still help you to stay focused on what still needs to be done. Some objects may be \u201cred herrings,\u201d or objects particularly designed to make you think they are a clue, when they actually are not. Don\u2019t spend a lot of time obsessing over 1 particular object if you can\u2019t find a useful purpose for it."
