Scrub you new wok in the sink with hot water, dish detergent, and a scouring pad to remove all the factory residue. You can use a sponge with a scrubby side instead of a scouring pad if you don\u2019t have one."

Turn on the fan above your stove if you have one and open all windows and doors. If you have any small portable fans, put them in the windows facing outside and turn them on to help ventilate the kitchen."

          "description":"This will protect them from getting scorched as you tilt the wok during the seasoning process. Cover all the exposed wood in tin foil and wrap it tightly so it doesn\u2019t fall off during seasoning. You can get away with just wrapping the lower portion of the main wooden handle if you want to leave the top part exposed to hold onto. It\u2019s most important to cover the \u201chelper handle\u201d, the smaller of the 2 handles, because it will be closer to the stove\u2019s burner as you tilt the wok around. Not all woks have 2 handles and not all handles are wooden. If your wok doesn\u2019t have wooden handles, then no there is no need to wrap them!"

Your wok may turn black, brown, blue, yellow, or some combination of these colors. Every carbon steel wok has a slightly different composition that can make it change different colors. Note that a gas stovetop will work much better for seasoning a wok. You can still do it on an electric stovetop, it will just be harder to evenly heat the sides since there are no flames."

It might not change color in all areas, but just try to heat it up as evenly as you can until it stops changing color. \u201dBlack rust\u201d is a protective layer that helps prevent corrosion. It also helps fats bind to the metal, which is an important part of seasoning a new wok!"

Don\u2019t try to scrub the metal back to its original color. The metal will be discolored from the heat, but it is not anything that you can scrub off. Just give the wok a quick once over and a final rinse to remove any remaining factory residues."

If you don\u2019t have a towel to dry the wok, then heat it up on the stove over medium heat until all the water evaporates. Your wok may look black, but this is just discoloration of the metal (not residue), so don\u2019t worry about it coming off on the towel."
