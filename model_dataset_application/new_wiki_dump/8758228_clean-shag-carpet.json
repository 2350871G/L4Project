This can take up to 48 hours, or even longer depending on the size of the carpet and the thickness of the fibers.

Be careful not to pull the machine too vigorously over the shag carpet, so as not to damage the carpet fibers. You can rent steam-cleaners from most grocery stores, home improvement stores, and even some carpet cleaning stores.
