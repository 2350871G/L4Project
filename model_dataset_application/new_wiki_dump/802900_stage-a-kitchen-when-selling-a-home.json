Go from top to bottom, and then from left to right\u2014this will help you make sure you haven\u2019t missed a spot. Be sure you are using the right cleaning products for different surfaces.

          "description":"Avoid leaving personal things out on the counters, or even inside the drawers. Things like paperwork, mail, photos, and even magnets on the fridge should all be taken out of the kitchen and packed up or stored elsewhere. Potential buyers want to see a clean slate, so that they can imagine their own lives in the space, rather than feeling like they have walked into someone else\u2019s. Keeping the counters as clear as possible will help showcase the spaciousness of the kitchen to potential buyers. If you have a lot of small appliances covering the countertops, store those elsewhere when showing the home. Consider boxing and storing things you don\u2019t really need out, or that might be cluttering your countertops, like coffee mugs or spice racks.

She received her Real Estate Certification in 2018 from the California Bureau of Real Estate, and now specializes as a Buyer's Agent and Listing Agent. Hannah Park\t\t\tReal Estate Agent\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: When you're staging your kitchen, your pantries, fridge, and cupboards should be cleaned out and free of any personal belongings. You also want to make sure to minimize clutter on your counter space. It's okay to add a few things to help potential buyers envision themselves living in the home, like inviting curtains or linens, but it shouldn't be much more than that."

          "description":"If you have large furniture items in your kitchen, like hutches or unattached islands, consider getting rid of these when staging your kitchen. They can make your space feel more closed in and appear smaller. By removing these items, your kitchen will look larger to potential buyers, who will then be able to imagine putting their own imprint on what they see. If you have bar stools at the kitchen counter or chairs around the dining table, remove extras you may have added. Use as few of these items as possible to let the room feel open."

          "headline":"Stay on top of kitchen odors.",
          "description":"Since you will likely still be living in your home while trying to sell it, chances are you will still be using the kitchen to cook and have meals. When showing the home, avoid cooking meals that leave lingering odors. Air out the kitchen and take the trash out daily to keep any odors from lingering in the kitchen. Keep pet food dishes and items out of the kitchen when showing the home. These can create smells you might not notice yourself, as you are used to them. Drop a piece of citrus into your garbage disposal. A chopped lemon works well. This will defeat odors in your sink and leave a lasting, pleasant aroma in the room."

          "headline":"Clean up messes as you make them.",
          "description":"Rather than spending a large amount of time cleaning the kitchen prior to showing it each time, just do one deep clean, and then clean up smaller messes as you make them. Wipe counters, and wash and put away dishes after cooking and serving meals. Put away items that may have gathered on your countertops throughout the day. When you start to cook, fill the sink with hot water and dish soap. This way, you can drop dishes in it to soak while you eat, and cleaning up will be much easier and faster as the dishes will be easier to wash after soaking."

You don\u2019t want them to open them and find cluttered messes. Keep dishes and food items organized and neat. Consider removing some or most of your food items and storing them in a box elsewhere during showings. You can also purchase a set of storage containers that match to showcase your pantry while still utilizing it."

Try replacing or removing any artwork, as well, since taste in art can vary deeply from person to person. Small or decorative mirrors are good replacements for photos and artwork.

The room will feel cleaner and look more spacious without them. Roll up and store kitchen mats or rugs during showings, but you can put your kitchen rug or mat back down between showings to protect the floors from spills and dirt."

Stick to a neutral pallet on the walls and cabinets, like white or off-white. A metallic accent or decoration like a mirror with a metallic frame can also make the room feel a bit more modern and luxurious. Try using a shiny, new tea kettle on the stove as an accent piece.

Towels are not permanent fixtures, so a buyer won\u2019t be worried about their colors or patterns. Hang the towels over the handle of your oven, or fold them neatly on the countertop beside the sink. Make sure you use clean towels that are in good condition.

Avoid leaving any fruit in the bowl that turns brown or starts to go overripe. You can also use fresh flowers in a nice vase on the countertop. Change out the flowers if they begin to wilt or die, and keep the water in the vase clean and fresh when showing the home."

White is a great option, as it brightens things up and gives the appearance of being newer and clean. Painting the cabinets and walls white can also help the kitchen appear larger, as the cabinets will blend in with the walls and things will look a bit wider and more spread out. Adding a fresh coat of paint to the cabinets or walls is a cheap and effective way to make any room feel newer and updated when trying to sell your home. Just stick with neutral colors that are on the lighter end of the spectrum (like white) to make your kitchen feel bright and open."

Go to your local hardware store and purchase an inexpensive light fixture to update the one in your kitchen. Choose a light fixture that allows a lot of light to come through. A fixture that only produces low or dimmer light doesn\u2019t work well in a kitchen."

Potential buyers don\u2019t want to find old appliances in the kitchen and have to worry about how much longer they will work until they need to be replaced. Try a big box appliance store or warehouse. You can often get good deals on newer appliances at these places, and stay within a smaller budget for upgrading. Contact or laminate paper is also a great way to upgrade an existing dishwasher without replacing it entirely. Put a sheet of contact or laminate paper in a glossy or shiny hue over the existing front panel, and you\u2019ve got a dishwasher that looks brand new."

Try asking your real estate agent what most buyers are looking for in your area in terms of kitchen hardware, and try to stick to that. By simply replacing knobs or pulls on cabinets and drawers, you can make them look brand new, even if they are not. This is a relatively cheap way to make your kitchen look more updated and new."
