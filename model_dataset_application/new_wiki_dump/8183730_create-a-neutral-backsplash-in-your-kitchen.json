You can go for off-whites, cream colors, and ivories. White tends to work best with smaller rooms with poor lighting. White also works best when your kitchen is primarily made up of other neutral colors. If your drawers and counters are in a shade of gray, for example, a white backsplash can be an excellent touch."

Complex neutrals are made by mixing neutral colors with more complicated shades. A complex neutral may end up being a light olive shade with warm undertones. You have to create complex neutrals yourself by mixing a lot of colors, so you may have to talk to an interior designer to get the shade you want. Complex neutrals work best if you want your home to have a more modern feel."

One particular color, or type of color, may already dominate the kitchen. Try to select a backsplash that matches.

This is a simple and economical way to achieve a neutral backsplash. Another benefit of boards is that they can be painted a variety of colors, so you can go for any backsplash shade you want. One downside of boards is that they produce a bit of a busy pattern.
