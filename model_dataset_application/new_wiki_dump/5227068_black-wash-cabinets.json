A gallon of black paint will yield two gallons of black-wash, since the paint is cut with water. The water-based urethane is about $25 per quart. A typical kitchen can be black-washed for under $200 DIY compared to having a professional do it for around $1000 or more."

Unmixed paint will drip off the mixing stick in long thick \u201cglops,\u201d while the paint mixed with water will run off the mixing stick in a steady flow. The mixed paint should be thin, but definitely thicker than water. If you suspect that it is too thin, add a little more paint and mix thoroughly. A little thicker is better than too thin. Mask off any adjoining surfaces you want protected from paint. Once completed, stir the paint mixture again to ensure a thorough mix."

If the final coat makes the cabinets too dark for your taste, use a wet (but not dripping) rag to wipe off the final coat before it has a chance to dry. If you have allowed the previous coats to dry properly, the damp rag will not affect those coats. The idea is to have some of the grain or previous finish showing through for the proper effect.

Shaking creates lots of foamy bubbles that set into the finish, preventing the surface from being smooth. Dip a polyfoam brush into the urethane and apply over the black wash finish.
