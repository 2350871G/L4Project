Make sure that the plastic chute, which will guide the popcorn into your bowl, is unattached. Let the popper heat up for about a minute, and then pour your kernels into the chamber. Your container of kernels will say how to measure your kernels to get a certain amount of popcorn. Put the chute back onto the air popper, and place a large bowl under the chute.

Be aware that hot steam will be released when you open the bag, so don\u2019t open it too close to your face. Dump out all of your popcorn from the open side. You\u2019ll want to use a fairly large mixing bowl so that you can easily stir the ingredients into your popcorn without pieces falling all over your counter.

About three tablespoons of butter should coat all of the popcorn, but the amount of butter you choose to add is really a matter of personal taste. There are typically tablespoon lines on your butter wrapper, but if not, three tablespoons is a little less than half a stick. If you love your popcorn drenched in butter (and no shame if you do! ), just melt more."

For a delicious hint of garlic, add one teaspoon of powder. For some eye opening, super garlicky popcorn, add a a tablespoon. It's always better to add a little bit of garlic at a time, so that you don't over-do it. Take a small taste test until it tastes exactly how you like."
