  "text":" Draining Tofu for \"Fish\" Preheat the oven to 200\u00baF or 95\u00baC. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Place a clear tea towel over a strainer.  Line a strainer with a clean tea towel.  Put the tofu into the strainer and cover with another clean tea towel.  Place the strainer over a large bowl to allow the liquid from the tofu to drain into it.  Leave the tofu in this position for an hour.  Making the Tartar Sauce Prepare all of the ingredients.  Stir together the ingredients specified for the sauce ingredients, in a medium bowl while the tofu is draining.  Chill the sauce in the refrigerator until ready to serve.  Making the Chips Fill a large pot with cold water and soak the sliced potatoes for one hour.  Drain the potatoes in the strainer and dry them thoroughly with a clean tea towel.  Prepare the cooling tray by layering a baking sheet with 8 sheets of newspaper and placing a cooling rack on top.  Heat the oil in a large cooking pot to 275\u00baF/140\u00baC. Check the accuracy of the temperature using a candy thermometer clipped to the side of the pot. Add the potatoes in small batches to the oil and fry them until they become soft and turn a light golden color.  Drain the fries on the cooling rack.  Transfer the potatoes from the cooling rack to the other baking sheet you prepared and put them in the oven to keep them warm when you're done frying them.  Re-fry the chips in the 350\u00baF/180\u00baC oil (see below) when you're ready to serve them to keep them crispy.  Making the \"Fish\" Component Mix the cornstarch and kelp powder together on a plate. Set aside. Make the batter for the tofu by whisking together the flour, baking powder, salt, garlic powder, white pepper and cayenne pepper in a large bowl. Make sure that the batter is smooth and consistent by whisking thoroughly. Pour the beer (or substitute) slowly into the batter by adding about a 1/4 cup at a time, whisking to incorporate. Continue to do so until all the beer has been incorporated into the batter. Heat the oil to 350\u00baF/180\u00baC in preparation for the tofu.  Remove the tofu from the strainer gently and place it on a cutting board.  Cut the tofu into 1/4\" thick slices using a sharp knife.  Dredge the tofu in the cornstarch and kelp powder.  Dip the tofu in the batter after coating it in the dry mixture, evenly coating all sides.  Put the battered tofu carefully in the oil and fry until it turns a golden brown.  Remove the tofu and drain it on the cooling rack.  Place the fish and chips on a platter with some optional lemon wedges, and with the tartar sauce for a salty, crispy delight. ",
