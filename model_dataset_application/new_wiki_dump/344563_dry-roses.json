Stretch a clothes line or rope between 2 points in this room and tie it securely. Make sure it is sturdy enough to hold your roses. You want to choose a dark space. The color of your roses will darken in the drying process, but exposing them to light will increase this color change, while using a dark space will reduce the alteration in the rose color."

Set your microwave to medium heat or defrost. Cook the desiccant for 2-3 minutes or until the color has returned to signify it is ready to use. Remove the bowl from the microwave using an oven mitt. Both the bowl and desiccant will be very hot. Allow it to cool on a heat-safe surface for 24 hours.
