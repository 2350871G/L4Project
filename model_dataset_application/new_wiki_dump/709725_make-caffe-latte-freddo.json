In the Italian tradition, they are always a blend of beans that in addition to being low in acidity, are heavily bodied, and sweet. You can buy a bag of your favorite espresso roast at any coffee shop or grocery store. If you don\u2019t know a lot about different roasts, then just look for \u201cEspresso Roast\u201d on the bag. If you get whole beans then you will have to grind them properly for espresso, which is a fine grind. You can substitute the espresso for strong coffee if you need, and add just a bit of sugar to mimic the sweetness of espresso."

Unlike the lattes you usually get at a coffee shop here, this drink has you just mixing the milk into the espresso and shaking. Whole milk is the standard in Italy, but you can use whichever milk you prefer. Thinner milks will affect how thick your drink ends up being."

The portafilter is where you pack in your grounds and if it is cold then this could affect the brewing temperature.

To ensure you get a proper grind, figure out which kind of grinder you have. There are a couple types of grinders out there, Burr Grinders and a Blade Grinders. Blade Grinders are better for drip and French Press because they don\u2019t usually offer a super fine grind. A Burr Grinder uses two burrs to efficiently grind your coffee beans and will be able to offer a much finer grind. If you are using a Blade Grinder, set the grinder to the highest setting for the finest grind. To see if your grind is fine enough you can do a simple test by pinching the grounds between your fingers. If a small portion clumps and stays compact between your fingers, your beans are ground fine enough."

Most espresso machines will automatically pull a double shot, which for best results should require between 18-21 grams of grounds.

Making the Espresso Pour the water in your espresso machine. The more pure the water, the better.
