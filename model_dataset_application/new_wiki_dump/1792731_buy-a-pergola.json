Knowing the purpose of your pergola should help you figure out how much shade and privacy you\u2019ll need. Use this information to determine which structure and location will be best for you. Attached pergolas can be attached to your house and used as small porches or to your deck to provide an area to entertain guests at a barbecue. Small freestanding pergolas can be placed in a garden and used like a trellis to grow vines upon. Larger freestanding pergolas can be used like gazebos. Pick a shady location to put your pergola if you\u2019re using it to cover a dining area or hot tub."

Depending on your area, there may be restrictions on where and how you can build your pergola legally. You may find that you have to obtain a construction permit in order to install your pergola. Living in a bushfire-prone area, for example, may significantly limit your material options."

          "description":"Once you\u2019ve decided on your pergola\u2019s purpose, as well as whether or not you intend to grow climbing plants on it, you\u2019ll need to think about how close together your rafters should be. More rafters set tighter together at perpendicular angles provide more shade, but less space for vegetation to grow into. A latticed roof is the best, most cost-efficient option if you want to maximize shade and privacy under your pergola."

          "headline":"Measure the area to determine the size you should get.",
          "description":"As pergolas are rectangular structures, you need to define the length and width of the pergola you want, whether you decide to get a freestanding or attached one. Factor in the size of your yard. It might look silly or odd to have a tiny pergola in a giant yard or a huge pergola in a small space. If you\u2019re putting your pergola on an existing patio, measure the length and width of the patio\u2019s surface."

          "description":"It\u2019s very important that your pergola is secure. You can either secure the pergola posts on a concrete slab or by sticking them into the ground. When deciding this, it\u2019s best to keep in mind what you\u2019d like to use the pergola for. If you plan to secure the posts by putting them into the ground, make sure that you purchase a pergola with posts that stand slightly taller than you want."

A cedar pergola will repel insects, repel water, give off a nice aroma, and resist decay. Redwood pergolas are desirable because of their strength and attractive appearance.

Go with either wrought iron, aluminum, or steel. Wrought iron pergolas are typically both the most expensive and most ornate choice. Choose steel if you want your pergola to stand strong for a long period of time. Aluminum pergolas are popular because they\u2019re inexpensive, sturdy, and lightweight."

You would only have to spray down a vinyl pergola with a garden hose from time to time to keep it looking good, and you won\u2019t have to worry about any cracks forming.

The stone material makes this style an expensive option, so if you\u2019re working with a small budget, consider getting a Tuscan style that uses materials other than the traditional stone."
