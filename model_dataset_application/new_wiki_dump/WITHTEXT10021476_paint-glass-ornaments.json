Swirl the liquid around until it coats the whole surface, then pour out any excess liquid into the sink. Let the ornament air dry, which should take several hours, face down before painting the interior. Set the ornament top aside somewhere safe, as you'll put it back on after painting it."

Spread the second and additional colors around using the same technique for an even, swirled pattern. Limit yourself to 2-3 paints per ornament, as any more can create a muddled color."

Check the painting progress between shakes, positioning the ornament in a way that the paint coats the entire surface. Stop shaking after you've coated the surface completely if you've added 2 or more colors, as too much shaking can muddle the color."

Place the paper cup somewhere it can set undisturbed for 24 hours while it dries. The ornament has to be upside down while it dries to get rid of excess paint. If it dries right-side up, excess paint can pool in the bottom and prevent it from drying. After you've dried the ornament, reattach the top and hang it with the rest of your decorations."
