  "text":" Common Cooking Mistakes Dilute food that is too salty by adding more liquid, a small amount of sugar and some vinegar to balance out the flavors. Adding a peeled, raw potato to a stew, sauce or casserole is believed to absorb salt in a dish. Don't eat the potato! This isn't a guaranteed solution to an over salted stew dish but you've got nothing to lose, except a potato. Dilute dressings that are too acidic with a pinch of baking soda or a small amount of sugar.  Cut down foods that are too sugary with a squeeze of lemon juice or a dash of vinegar. Fats like olive oil or butter can also reduce the sugary taste. Salvage overcooked vegetables by pureeing them with a little bit of salt, olive oil and/or butter in a food processor. Serve them as a side dish. Pureed vegetables can also be turned into a soup by heating them with chicken stock and a bit of cream. Save overcooked pasta by heating a pan with olive oil and saut\u00e9ing it until it is slightly hardened, simulating the \"al dente,\" or firm, texture. Sprinkle Parmesan on the top for extra flavor that will mask any mush. Fix lumpy gravy by passing it through a sieve, or strainer. Also, you can puree it with a blender. Use dry bread by cutting it into thin slices, covering in a thin layer of butter or olive oil and baking at 325 degrees Fahrenheit (163 degrees Celsius) until it is crisp. Serve with soups or appetizers. If bread is hard, pulse it in a food processor and use as breadcrumbs. Serve overcooked chicken by cutting it into slices, then mixing olive oil and basil, thyme and tarragon with some salt and pepper. Dress chicken and salad greens with the sauce and serve as chicken salad. Make a dish out of overripe fruit by adding a touch of vanilla extract or lemon juice. Sprinkle with sugar and a little cinnamon. Mix and serve. Revive limp salad greens by soaking them for twenty minutes in acidulated water. Once drained, the greens will be crisp again. Common Baking Mistakes Fix a burned cake by carefully removing the burned top, sides or bottom, then thickly frosting the top and side sections before serving.  Use frosting to cover a crumbly cake. Glue large crumbled pieces with frosting. Rinse with warm water and dry between frostings to ensure the crumbs don't appear on the top of your frosting.
