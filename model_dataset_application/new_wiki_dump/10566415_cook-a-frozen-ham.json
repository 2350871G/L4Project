          "description":"This is the safest method of thawing ham, but also takes the most time. Put the frozen ham in a rimmed pan or on a baking sheet to catch any drips that occur during the thawing process. Place the ham in its container on the lowest shelf of your fridge. Thawing ham in the fridge takes about 4 to 6 hours per 1 pound (0.45 kg). If the ham is larger than 10 to 11 pounds (4.5 to 5.0 kg), it could take up to 7 hours per 1 pound (0.45 kg) for it to thaw. Allow 2-3 days to thaw a ham of 10 pounds (4.5 kg) in the refrigerator. After your ham has thawed in the fridge, it can remain refrigerated for 3-5 days before you cook it. You can also freeze it again if you don\u2019t cook it in that time frame."

          "description":"Wrap the ham securely in an airtight plastic bag. Plug the sink, and place the ham in it. Then fill the sink with cold water. Drain it every half hour and replace the water to make sure it stays cold enough. Allow about 30 minutes per 1 pound (0.45 kg) of ham to thaw. Make sure the water is cold, not warm or hot. If the water isn\u2019t cold, the outside of the ham could reach temperatures of 40 \u00b0F (4 \u00b0C) before the inside of the ham is thawed. Temperatures this high can cause bacterial growth and food poisoning. Cook the ham immediately after you\u2019ve thawed it in cold water. It cannot be frozen again with this method."

          "description":"Put the microwave on its defrost setting. Consult your microwave\u2019s instruction manual for the correct defrosting time based on the weight of your ham. This method is not ideal for larger pieces of meat. The meat will cook unevenly as the outside begins cooking before the inside is thawed. Some parts may become dry and overcooked. Avoid thawing meat over 2 pounds (0.91 kg) in the microwave. After thawing in the microwave, ham should be cooked immediately. Do not refreeze it."
