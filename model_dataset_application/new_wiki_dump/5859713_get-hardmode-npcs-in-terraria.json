      "headline":"Defeat a Pirate Invasion.",
      "description":"You can summon one by defeating a Goblin Invasion in Hardmode to acquire a Pirate Map. Using it will summon a pirate invasion (on PC you will have to defeat flying ships via destroying cannons to get past it). A Pirate will then move into a house if you have one unoccupied."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Make a house in a surface Mushroom Biome.",
      "description":"You need to go to the underground mushroom biome and keep breaking the tall grass that grows from it. Do this until you get Mushroom Biome seeds. Make an artificial mushroom biome by getting mud from the jungle and laying it somewhere, then plant the seed into the mud. Build a house in the biome once the glowing mushrooms grow, and then a Truffle will move into that house. This house can't be underground, it has to be on top of the grass in the artificial Mushroom biome."

    {
      "headline":"Explore the Cavern layer.",
      "description":"You can encounter a bound Wizard. Talk to him to unbind him and leave him. He will eventually move into your house."

    {
      "headline":"Defeat one of the three Mechanical Bosses.",
      "description":"We recommend the Destroyer, as it's the easiest to spawn and beat. You can spawn it by using a Mechanical Worm, which is crafted from 6 Souls of Night, 15 Vertabrae/Rotten Chunk, and 5 Iron Bars at a Mythril or Orithcalum Anvil. After one is defeated, the Steampunker will spawn in an available house."

      "headline":"After all three (just one as of the Mobile version) Mechanical Bosses are defeated, a message will appear that says; \"The Jungle grows restless...\" Once you see this message appear, it means Plantera's Bulb has spawned somewhere in the Underground Jungle.",
      "description":"Find it and destroy it. This will summon the boss Plantera. After you beat her, the Cyborg will want to live in a house."

      "headline":"Beat the Frost Legion, which is summoned by a Snow Globe.",
      "description":"After you beat it, Santa Claus is available to spawn (note: You only have from December 15 to December 31 to get Santa to spawn. After that, he no longer spawns. Once you get him, he stays all year round, though)."
