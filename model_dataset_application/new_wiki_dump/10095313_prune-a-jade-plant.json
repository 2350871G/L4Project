Pruning those branches develops thicker, stronger stems, which lets your plant grow taller and wider. Don\u2019t prune young plants (under 1 year old). They are still developing their roots and trunk during the first year, and pruning them too soon will permanently stunt their growth."

Your jade plant only needs 3-5 hours of sunlight every day. Keep it somewhere it gets sunlight but avoid placing it in direct light for long periods of time, as this could burn your plant."

Or if you are mainly looking to shape your jade plant, prune individual leaves or partial sections of branches. Cut just above the leaf node (where the leaf grows out of the branch). Avoid cutting the main branch (or trunk) of the plant. This is the main section that connects to the roots. The only time you will cut this main truck is when you are cutting down most of the plant to help it heal from infection. Give branches enough space so they aren\u2019t touching or rubbing each other. Overcrowding limits the amount of light the plant gets. A compact and full jade plant is a healthy jade plant\u2014it will regenerate and thrive when you prune it."

Cut at that intersection at a roughly 45-degree angle. This lets the plant sprout multiple new branches that are thicker and more compact. It might feel backwards to cut off entire branches of the plant, but by doing so you\u2019re making room for new growth and are giving your plant a chance to grow stronger."
