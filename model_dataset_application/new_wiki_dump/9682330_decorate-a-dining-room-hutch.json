Use plate holders to prop the plates upright, and place the setting in a prominent place in your hutch. You can also set the silverware on a napkin in front of the china, plus add a teacup on a saucer. Hang the plates on the wall above the hutch or set tea cups on a shelf in the hutch if you want to display your china in a new way."

It will make setting the table easy, and then you can keep your china in an area that won't gather as much dust. Think about putting the majority of dishes on 1 shelf near the bottom so they don't take over the whole decorative space. You may want to display dishes that are all the same color if the hutch has glass doors or panels."

Pick 1 or 2 colors, such as a neutral color and a bright color or white and a metallic color, and only use items in that color scheme. If you're not sure what colors you want, start with an object you love and use that to build your color scheme. Use the same color or theme already present in your dining room for a cohesive look."

In other words, don't overload the decorative space. Too many items in the display area will be too much to take in at once. Just pick a couple of large pieces that you love. Place them in various places on different shelves and add other smaller items in between. Leave some extra space around the items so the display won't be visually overwhelming.

Just to be sure to follow the rule of placing the largest items in the back, so you can see the shorter items up front. You may have 2 or 3 sizes of \"large\" items in the back, and several sizes of shorter items in the front. Also, balance the area. You don't want to put several large pieces next to each other on 1 shelf and then have another shelf with all tiny objects. That will look unbalanced. Instead, make sure to scatter your large and small objects throughout to make it more visually appealing."

Think about it like telling a story. Use each little area to tell its own story by balancing objects in it you love. When creating vignettes, use 3 items to create visual balance. They can be 3 different objects, 3 different styles, or 3 different colors."
