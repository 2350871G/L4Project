One way to minimize the amount of seed that falls is to attach a tray or tub to the bottom of the bird feeder to catch any seed that falls out. Just make sure to empty the tray frequently so it doesn\u2019t overflow. If possible, choose a tray with a mesh bottom so that it will catch falling seeds but not become waterlogged if it rains. You can also minimize spillage by filling each feeder with a single type of seed. That way, birds won\u2019t make a mess by picking out and discarding the seeds they don\u2019t like."

You can try treating your lawn with milky spore powder, a natural pesticide available in most home or garden supply stores, in the late summer or early autumn.Tip: Overwatering your lawn can drive grubs up to the surface, where skunks can get at them more easily. Make sure you are watering your lawn properly to avoid this problem. Another option is to mix up a solution of 1 part children\u2019s shampoo to 1 part household ammonia and spray it on your lawn. In addition to killing the grubs, this solution can also help fertilize your lawn. The odor of the ammonia may also discourage skunks!"

If you have any trees in your yard that produce fruit, berries, or nuts, pick up anything that falls out of the tree promptly. You might find it helpful to rake your yard to more easily remove any edible debris. Try to pick ripe fruit or nuts from trees promptly before they fall on their own. If you have a garden, harvest any fruits and vegetables as they become ripe. Most skunks aren\u2019t good climbers, so they\u2019re unlikely to be able to get at fruit that\u2019s still in the tree."

To keep skunks from digging or squeezing under, you\u2019ll need to make sure the chicken wire extends at least 1 foot (30 cm) under the ground. If there\u2019s already a skunk living under your deck or another structure on your property, you will need to scare it out before sealing the area off. Try encouraging the skunk to leave by setting up a bright light or an ultrasonic deterrent to frighten it away. Before setting up any deterrents, wait until you\u2019re pretty sure the skunk is away from its den."

Otherwise, skunks may come in to seek shelter or look for food. Check for holes or gaps that a skunk could get into and seal them off with wire mesh or another suitable material, such as cement or plaster."

If you suspect you have a skunk in your yard, clear away any large piles of rocks, sticks, wood, junk, or lawn waste that it could be hiding under. If you keep a firewood pile in your yard and are concerned about skunks denning under it, try putting a fence around it or spraying the area with a skunk deterrent, such as a castor oil spray or a commercial skunk repellent. You can also store cut lumber or firewood in a closed shed or other outbuilding, if you have one."

If the den is occupied, the skunk will be able to push its way out. If the material remains undisturbed for 2-3 days, you can assume the den is unoccupied and seal it off more permanently, e.g., by blocking it off with wire.Tip: If there are any baby skunks in the den, wait until they are old enough to leave the den and forage before trying to scare out the skunks. If the den is still occupied, one option is to install a 1-way door at the entrance to the den. This device will allow skunks to leave the den, but they will not be able to go back inside once they\u2019ve left. You can buy 1-way animal doors online or from many home or garden supply stores. You can also try scaring any current occupants out of the den with a natural repellent or a sound or light deterrent."

If you keep chickens or other livestock that skunks might be interested in, secure the area by putting wire fencing around the coop. Make sure the wire extends at least 8 inches (20 cm) under the ground around the coop. Ideally, it should also extend horizontally away from the enclosure another 8 inches (20 cm), so that it forms an L shape. Skunks also like to eat bees and their larvae. If you keep bees, keep the hives elevated so that skunks can\u2019t easily reach them."

Spray the mixture around a suspected skunk den or any areas where you think skunks are messing around on your property. You can also use capsaicin oil, or hot pepper spray, to deter skunks.

Look for a light-based animal deterrent and set it up in an area where skunks are active. You can also use repellents that emit loud or high-pitched noises, or even use something like a portable radio to play noise that skunks will find unpleasant. You can buy light and sound-based outdoor animal deterrents online or at most home or garden supply stores.Keep in mind: Skunks can get used to these kinds of deterrents eventually, so you may need to switch to a new tactic after a while or use them in combination with other deterrents."
