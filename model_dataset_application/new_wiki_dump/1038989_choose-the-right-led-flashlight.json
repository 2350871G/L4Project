      "description":"The types of flashlights sold at most major retailers are very limited, and are usually geared toward standard disposable batteries. Rechargeable Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries are a better choice. Most retailers sell these. For these types of batteries to work in an LED flashlight, the light must be a AA flashlight. A flashlight made for lithium batteries cannot use standard AA or NiMH batteries. The best lithium battery flashlights are usually only available at online retailers. Disposable lithium batteries are expensive, and don't last long in high-power flashlights. Rechargeable lithium batteries are much cheaper to operate. They are also only available through mail order. Conventional alkaline batteries have a long shelf life but must be replaced. Alkaline batteries are also prone to leaking if left stored for long periods. Lithium-ion batteries can be recharged with a lithium battery charger. Rechargeable lithium batteries have an extremely long shelf-life, and once charged, will hold their charge up to one year without much loss. Disposable lithium batteries, known as CR123's, can be stored up to TEN years with no possibility of leakage or degradation. Even a rechargeable battery may someday need to be replaced. Most rechargeable batteries whether they are lithium or NiMH, can usually be charged up to 500 times before they'll no longer hold a charge."
