Therefore, first follow the instructions for your favorite recipe to make the dough, making adjustments to the flour and yeast content as desired to get the results you want. You may be able to successfully freeze the dough without making any adjustments to the recipe. The only way to really know, however, is to try it out. If the dough doesn\u2019t rise and bake properly after freezing, however, you\u2019ll likely need to make some adjustments to the flour and yeast to get the taste and texture you want."

          "description":"When freezing bread dough, the cold can cause the gluten in the bread to weaken, which can result in dense, flat bread. To avoid this, use flour with a higher protein content, such as whole wheat, durum or rye. The high protein content will prevent the dough from losing too much of the gas produced during fermentation (rising). Many bread recipes call for lower protein content flours, such as all-purpose white flour or bread flour. In most cases, you can substitute the flour in the recipe for a higher protein flour without making any changes to the flour measurement."

          "description":"Freezing your bread dough may damage some of the yeast, which can prevent the dough from rising a second time after it thaws. To make sure that the dough is able to rise after being frozen, you can either double the amount of yeast called for in your favorite recipe, or use a slow rising yeast instead of the quick-rising yeast called for in many recipes. If you use a slow rise yeast instead of quick-rising yeast, use the same amount called for in the recipe."

          "description":"Set the dough out in a lightly greased bowl or on parchment paper at room temperature for about 45 minutes to allow the dough time to rise (also referred to as fermenting or proofing). This will allow you to shape the dough into a loaf or rolls, and will save you time when you thaw the bread. Some bread recipes call for bread dough to be left to rise twice. If this is the case, you\u2019ll likely need to leave the dough to rise for another 45 minutes after it\u2019s thawed."

Then, separate the dough into several small sections and shape it into balls if you want to freeze the dough into rolls. If you\u2019re freezing the dough in a loaf pan, you don\u2019t need to shape the dough after punching it down, as it\u2019ll get its shape once it\u2019s in the loaf pan."
