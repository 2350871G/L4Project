To prevent large food from undercooking and small food from overcooking, separate the food and cook it separately. Starchy vegetables like potatoes and sweet potatoes tend to need the longest cooking time, followed by meat, and then smaller vegetables need the shortest time."

Large chunks of meat, for instance, will cook faster if you cut them into strips or smaller portions first. Foods you may want to chop before cooking include potatoes (unless you're baking them), other large vegetables, and large cuts of meat."

This will ensure even cooking time, because food around the outer edges will cook faster than food closer to the center. Microwave-safe dishes will be labeled as such, but glass and ceramic are usually safe to microwave, even if they aren't labelled. Don\u2019t microwave metal containers or utensils."
