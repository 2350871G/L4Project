Because they have been cultivated in local farms over a long period of time, heirloom seeds are particularly good at dealing with the regional climate. Due to their growing conditions, these seeds are typically sold by specialty shops. Some good, large strains include:\nEarly Boy tomatoes, a Big Boy variant designed for colder weather and shorter growing seasons. Creole tomatoes, large, slow-growing tomatoes designed or warm, southern climates. Mortgage Lifter tomatoes, a heavy Beefsteak variant designed for long seasons."
