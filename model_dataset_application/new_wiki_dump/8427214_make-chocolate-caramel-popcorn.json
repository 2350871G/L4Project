Fold the top of the bags down to close them. 1 \u215b cups (253 g) of unpopped popcorn should yield approximately 18 cups (144 g) of popped popcorn. It\u2019s best not to put all of the kernels in one bag because they likely won\u2019t fit inside a single bag once they pop. If you\u2019re concerned about the popcorn coming loose when you heat it, you can seal the bags closed with tape. If you have an air popper, you can use it to pop the popcorn. You just want to be sure that the popcorn is unbuttered and unsalted when you add the caramel and chocolate."

After you\u2019ve finished popping the first bag, repeat the process with the second bag. The amount of time required to pop the popcorn depends on your microwave. It\u2019s best to start with just a minute or a minute and half and heat the bag again if there are still a large number of unpopped kernels. Keep an eye on the popcorn as it pops.

Grease the roasting pan with butter or nonstick cooking spray. When you transfer the popcorn to the pan, take the time to pick out any unpopped or burnt kernels. If you like, you can add a cup and half (200 g) of nuts to the popcorn. Toss them together so the nuts are distributed evenly throughout the popcorn."
