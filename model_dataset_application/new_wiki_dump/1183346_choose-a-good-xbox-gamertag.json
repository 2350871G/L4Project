          "description":"Having trouble thinking of a good Gamertag? Your actual name is a great place to start. Try making a play on your first or last name. If you have a nickname, you can use it as well. Another idea is to make a pun or a reference to a character with a similar name from fiction. Examples: Someone named John Smith might try XxSmithxX, JSmith95, JohnnyBoy1234, or AgentSmith4589. Don't include your full, real name in your Gamertag. Keep in mind that anyone you play on Xbox Live will be able to see your name. For security reasons, it's a wise idea to keep your real-world identity to yourself."

You might try naming yourself after a character from this game. You can also try something less on-the-nose like a place, weapon, or event. Examples: If you love the Halo series, you might try MasterChief3000, MrNeedler, CortanaLover99, CovenenantSquad01, or EliteHammer."

Draw on your wide range of skills, hobbies, and interests to think of an idea. You might reference an animal you like, a band you're a fan of, your dream car, or something else entirely. It's all up to you! Examples: If you're a musician, you might try names with music terminology like TrebleKill333, BassicInstinct, Bad2theTrombone, BFlattened, and so on."

This can be good when you're working with teammates toward a shared objective. Names that make someone laugh at first sight are always a good bet. Since you're working with a limited number of characters, quick puns are often easiest. Examples: ChrisPBacon, CubaBaddingJR, TheOtherGuy, HeyYou (so that when people talk to you in-game, it's confusing.) You may want to try using an online tool like the Pun Generator (available here) if you're having trouble thinking of ideas."

One is to translate a cool-sounding name that's already taken into another language. You can also try using the language's equivalent of your real name. You can even just find a word that you like the look of \u2014 it's up to you! Examples: If you're a fan of bears, you might try Urso (\"Urso\" is \"bear\" in Portuguese) or Ayi (\"Ayi\" is \"bear\" in Turkish)\nOnline translators like Google Translate and Freetranslation.com can help with these sorts of names."

Try combining two words that have no connection or using a random adjective to describe a word you happen to like. The more creative, the better! Examples: GrandioseFox, OceanPillar, PantHill, Seven8Six, etc. You can even use a nonsense word or phrase \u2014 something that means nothing at all."

For instance, the name \"Adolph Hitler\" would definitely be prohibited under the rule against controversial historical figures. However, a name like \"A.
