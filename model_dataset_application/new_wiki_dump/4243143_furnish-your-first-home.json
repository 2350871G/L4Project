          "description":"You won\u2019t have enough to furnish your entire home, but that\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t need to start over from scratch. Arrange all of your old furnishings in your home, thinking about which ones are worth keeping. Try to avoid hanging onto anything broken or things you never plan on using. Sort your items out before you move them to your new home. It may save you some money in moving expenses. You could also sell your old items for extra pocket change to put toward new furniture. Be cautious about throwing away anything useable. That old couch may not be what you want in your new home, but it\u2019s worth keeping if you don\u2019t have a replacement yet."

Plan out each room as much as you can to keep a running list of what you need to fill the space. Don\u2019t forget to spend time in any smaller areas you have, like foyers and hallways. Focus on small items as well as big ones. Furniture like couches, chairs, and beds are the easiest to put on your list, but get specific. Consider features like appliances, lamps, and picture frames as well."

          "description":"Aim on furnishing the most used areas of your home first. Typically, the bedroom and living room are the ones to focus on, but it depends on your home. Get the most out of these rooms by decorating them first. Break it down further by ranking the furnishings in each room by necessity. Since you\u2019re going to spend more time in some rooms compared to others, it makes sense to put more effort into decorating them. The side rooms can wait. Furnish them as much as possible for now and add to them over time."

If you need to, measure the width and height of these features so you know how much room you have left for furnishings. Use the floor plan as a guide when you\u2019re designing the room and choosing furniture for it. For example, the fixtures determine where you can put certain objects. You wouldn\u2019t put a big bookcase in front of a window or in a room with a low ceiling. Keep in mind that furniture often looks bigger when you get it home than it does at the store. Have your floor plan handy to use as a comparison before making a purchase."

In that case, move on to filling the rooms with less important items like nightstands, cabinets, and decorations. Since the essentials are so important, buy for quality over a quantity. A good mattress with quality sheets will likely last you much longer than a cheap set that gives you back pain. You don\u2019t need a set of uncomfortable chairs, just a few you don\u2019t mind relaxing on. The extra chairs help a lot for times when you have guests over. The amount you need depends on how often you have people over and how many you invite."

When you get a little extra spending money and stumble across something you like, get it for your home. Begin completing rooms with extra furniture, appliances, decorations, and anything else you might need. Taking care of the necessities first gives you more time to save and search for quality furnishings you like. Don\u2019t rush to decorate. You\u2019re better off waiting to find exactly what you need."

Also, check thrift stores, consignment stores, garage sales, estate sales, and online listings. You don\u2019t need to buy new to get something stylish and unique. These sources all sell good furniture at a fraction of the retail price. There is no need to buy furniture in a set. Get your furnishings 1 at a time as you find things you like. Even if you don\u2019t intend on keeping all of these secondhand furnishings long-term, use them to set up your home until you get a chance to replace them.

Reupholster couches and chairs with new fabric and refinish wood. Then, put the money you save toward getting what you really want. Refurbishing furniture does take a little extra time and effort, but it\u2019s often worth it if you want to hang onto something that has gotten plenty of use."

Even if you don\u2019t have much experience, you could save money by making your own table or chair, for example. You will need to get a set of tools and material for building projects, but the cost is typically much less than what you would spend on a new piece of furniture from a box store. Another option is to make your own decorations. If you\u2019re good at sewing, make your own pillows. If you\u2019re good at painting, hang up your paintings to give your home its own unique character."

Plan out your purchases according to when items are out of season. Winter items go on sale at the beginning of summer, while stores clear out summer items at the end of summer. For example, if you\u2019re looking for indoor furniture, look for sales during the spring. Appliances often go on sale before holidays. You don\u2019t have to wait to purchase items. If something is a necessity, get it as soon as you can. The sales price isn\u2019t as important as the quality."

Take advantage of your new space to clear out old junk and dispose of older items you no longer need. Make sure you can\u2019t use older items to furnish other rooms first. If you\u2019re certain you no longer have a use for something, try to get a replacement as needed before disposing of it. Sell or donate good items you no longer need.

You might wish to leave your best or most important furnishing out in the open so guests see it as soon as they enter the room. For example, if you have a stylish sofa, make it stand out.

Try painting the walls neutral colors and then spicing up the atmosphere with colorful accents. If you already have a room theme in mind, getting more adventurous is fine. Color your walls red if you like, but add dark-colored furniture to compliment it and create an autumn theme. The best time to remodel the walls and flooring is before you get most of your furnishings in the room. Start with neutral tones if you're still uncertain about what you want to do.
