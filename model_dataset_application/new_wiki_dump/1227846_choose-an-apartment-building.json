The building may provide a private lot for its residents, or may have reserved parking spaces for each individual apartment. If not, look into the availability of street parking. Parking several blocks and walking to get to your building works fine during the summer, but can become a major hassle on cold winter nights.

Or, look online at the city\u2019s public-transit map and see where the closest stop is relative to a potential apartment building that you\u2019re scoping out.

Having a short commute is nice, so finding a place that\u2019s within a 10- or 15-minute drive would be ideal. If you own your own vehicle and commute more than 30 minutes each day, you\u2019ll end up spending a large portion of your monthly budget on gas. Or, if you take the bus to your job, you could end up commuting for several hours a day if your apartment building is far from your workplace. Driving a long distance to your job or being stuck in rush-hour traffic will leave you less time to enjoy your apartment."

When you\u2019re evaluating apartment buildings, figure out which amenities you would like to have, and choose a building accordingly. For example, you may feel that an in-apartment washing machine is mandatory, but an on-site gym isn\u2019t something you need.

As a rule of thumb, you shouldn\u2019t pay more than a third of your after-tax salary on rent. So, if you make $2,000 USD a month after taxes are taken out, look for an apartment building that offers rental rates less than $670 USD a month.

Buildings on higher floors are often more expensive, but they also tend to be quieter, have better security, and to have fewer pests. On the other hand, ground-floor or garden-level rooms are more convenient to get to and may come with outdoor space. Decide what\u2019s most important to you, and choose an apartment building that offers rooms on the floor you prefer. You can also use this criteria to remove buildings from the running.

On the other hand, if you\u2019re severely allergic to cats or dogs, an animal-free building may be just what you\u2019re looking for. You could also try looking online to find this information. Most apartment complexes will post their pet policy on their website. It would also be wise to ask about a pet fee.

Walk around both outside and inside the apartment building and see if there are any prospective sources of loud noises that could keep you from resting when you\u2019re home. If 1 building in a large complex seems like it will be too loud, ask the property manager if they can offer you a room in another on-site building. For example, if the building houses the indoor pool, gym, or party room, you may experience more noise than you can tolerate. A building that\u2019s within a few dozen yards of a freeway, railroad tracks, or commercial buildings that take early deliveries, also experience a lot of noise. Elevators can be noisy, as can exit doors to stairways. If your apartment is near the entrance, you will have to listen to neighbors walking past your door at all hours."

Talk to the property manager and make sure that the gate is routinely locked nightly. The slight inconvenience of having to stop and use your key to enter the building is often worth the peace of mind you get from knowing that you won\u2019t be easy prey for criminals, door-to-door salespeople, and people who would hang take-out menus on your doorknob.

A clean, well-lit, and well-maintained interior will also help you feel safer and more at home. If the interior hallways are dimly lit and covered in cobwebs, the doors are unpainted, and the carpet is filthy, find a different building. These are signs of negligent management, and indicate that cleanliness isn\u2019t a priority to the maintenance crew. Also keep your eyes open for any signs of bug or rodent infestations, leaky ceilings, or broken windows. It also wouldn\u2019t hurt to research the age of the building online.
