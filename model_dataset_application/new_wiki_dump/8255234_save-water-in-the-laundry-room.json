Brushing too hard could cause the color in the fabric to lift. Stain remover can be found in the laundry section of most grocery stores, general retailers, and drug stores. Pre-treating will ensure your stains come out in the first wash cycle, which will save you from wasting water re-washing clothes."

The \"Extra Rinse\" cycle helps to remove detergent more thoroughly from your clothing. However, people with sensitive skin can suffer skin irritation if the Extra Rinse is skipped. If you have sensitive skin but still want to save water, consider using gentle, all-natural, chemical free detergents. These are gentler on the skin, and might not cause irritation when skipping the Extra Rinse cycle."
