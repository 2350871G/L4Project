          "description":"While sunflowers can be started indoors, they work best if they're started in the ground. Sunflower roots are sensitive to being moved, so transplanting them may kill them. They grow best at temperatures between 64 and 91\u00baF (18\u201333\u00baC), but you can plant at slightly lower temperatures, once the last frost has passed. Sunflowers usually take 80 to 120 days to mature and produce new seeds, depending on the variety. If the growing season is shorter than this in your area, plant the sunflowers two weeks before the last frost; most seeds will probably survive."

          "headline":"Select a sunflower variety.",
          "description":"There are many sunflower varieties and hybrids, but most gardeners will only need to look at a couple characteristics, usually described on the seed packet or online listing. Be sure to check the sunflower's maximum height, since this ranges from dwarf varieties under 1 foot (30 cm), to giant sunflowers 15 ft (4.6 m) or taller. Also, decide between a sunflower that produces one stalk and flower, or one that branches out into multiple stalks with several smaller blooms. It is not possible to grow plants from roasted sunflower seeds, but you can grow it from sunflowers in bird seed, as long as the outer shell is present."

          "description":"Moisten a paper towel slightly, so it is damp but not soaked or dripping. Place the sunflower seeds on one half of the towel, then fold it over to cover them. If you have a large number of sunflower seeds, and don't mind a lower success rate, you can skip straight to planting. Seeds planted directly in the soil typically take 11 days to emerge. If you have a long growing season, try germinating seeds in batches one or two weeks apart, so you'll have blooms in your garden for a longer period of time."

Typically, you'll see sprouts emerge from most of the seeds within 48 hours. Once this happens, move on to planting the seeds. Keep the paper towels at a temperature above 50\u00baF (10\u00baC) for best results."

If your soil is poor, or you want to put in the extra effort to encourage growth, mix rich, loamy soil into your planting area. There is rarely any need to adjust your soil pH, but if you already own a pH kit, you may adjust it to between 6.0 and 7.2. Rich soil is recommended for giant varieties, since they require more nutrients."
