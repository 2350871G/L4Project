Cutting the rose branch at an angle near a bud will prevent water from collecting on the top of the cut. The main tool you\u2019ll use for snipping off rose branches is a pair of pruning shears, curved on both edges. If you\u2019re pruning thick stems near the center of the rose bush, use a long pruning saw or lopping shears, depending on how far you need to reach to make the cut."

          "description":"One of the primary goals in pruning rose bushes is to remove any extraneous branches and stems from the bush that could impede the flow of air. Cut off branches until you can see through from 1 side of the bush to the other with relatively few branches in your way. A rose bush that is gnarled and choked will have a poor air supply at its center. Consequently, the branches and buds in the middle of the bush won\u2019t grow."

          "description":"Suckers are small, unwanted rose growths which graft on to the roots of large, established rose bushes. If left to grow, suckers will drain away nutrients from the rose bushes. If you notice a sucker at the base of a plant, dig down through the soil until you find the place where the sucker has grafted onto the root. In most cases, you can use your hand to tear off the small suckers from the roots of rose bushes. If the suckers are more than \u20448 inch (0.32 cm), though, you may need to use the shears to cut them off."

If you see any stems that are damaged, prune the stem. This applies whether the damaged branch is almost entirely severed already, or just slightly cracked. If damaged areas are not cut, they often lead to diseased branches."

The diseases that afflict most types of rose bushes are fungal, so you may notice patches of what looks like mildew creeping down the rose stems, or a red-mottled color on the stalk. Trim the rose stem at least \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) below diseased tissue. After trimming potentially diseased branches, it\u2019s important to sterilize your pruning shears. Do this by spraying the blades with a household cleaner like Lysol, or by dipping the blades in isopropyl alcohol. While pruning for dead and diseased branches can be done at any time of year, it\u2019s especially important to do during winter, before rose bushes \u201cwake up\u201d and begin to grow."

This will open up the rose bush, and allow air to be drawn all the way into the bush, leading to better growth during the spring.
