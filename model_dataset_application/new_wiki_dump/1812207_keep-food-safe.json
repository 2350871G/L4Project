The longer it sits in your shopping cart, the more likely it will be to go bad. Choose wrapped packages without tears, holes, or leaks. The package should be cold and feel firm when lightly squeezed. Smell the chicken. If it smells spoiled, don't buy it. Check the sell-by date. Remember that this is different than the use-by date; it's okay if it's today's date. Just plan to use the chicken within two days of its sell-by date to be safe."
