          "description":"Purchase about 6 ounces (160 g) of country ham and cut it into 1/4-inch thick slices. If you're using large center-cut pieces of ham, cut them in half so you have two medium-sized pieces. Take a small knife and cut about 1/4-inch thick slits in the fat along the edges of the ham, about every three inches. This will prevent the ham from curling as you fry it. Country ham is very salty, so you probably won't need to add extra salt to the ham or gravy. If you don't want to use ham, you could try making the gravy by frying up bacon and using the drippings."

This will also make the ham plump up. Drain the water before you're ready to fry the ham. You could also soak the ham in milk to give it additional flavor."

Pat the ham dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture. The pan is ready when the melted butter starts sizzling. It's important to use unsalted butter since the ham is so salty. This will prevent the gravy from becoming overly salty as well."

Use tongs to carefully remove the fried ham to a serving plate. If the ham is lean, you may need to add another 1/2 of a tablespoon of butter."
