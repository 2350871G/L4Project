  "text":" Buying Supplies Find or buy tea towels. Vintage designs are available at second hand shops, while hand painted versions are popular at farmer\u2019s markets. You can also find them at large box stores or hidden in your own linen closet. Buy a pillow form. You can choose a synthetic or down pillow in a lumbar or square style. Make sure it is no more than 12 inches tall and two inches thinner than the width of your tea towel. Thread your sewing machine with matching thread, or opt for the no-sew method. You can use this method, but create the seams with fabric adhesive in place of stitches. Constructing the Pillow Cover Smooth out your tea towel on your worktable. Place the right side out. You can find the right side by looking at the seams. If you can see where the seams were folded, turn it over. Iron the tea towel it if it is wrinkled. Keep the iron nearby so that you can fold and press your new seams. Set it out vertically, with the longer side going north to south. Place the pillow form on top to ensure the tea towel is wider than your pillow. Fold the bottom of the tea towel up halfway. Fold the top of the tea towel down on top of it. You want it to be the exact height of your pillow form. If your pillow form is very small, you may need to cut off part of the tea towel across the bottom or top. Otherwise, you can avoid cutting the tea towel entirely. Measure it to see if it is the exact height of your pillow form. Adjust as necessary. Allow one side to overlap the other side by at least four inches, so that it doesn\u2019t pucker when it\u2019s turned right side out and wrapped around the pillow. Measure from the center, the right and the left. This will ensure your seam is even. Press the top and bottom seams down with your iron. Pin the sides of the pillows together, letting the pins stick out perpendicular to the side edge of the pillow. Skip the pinning if you are doing the no-sew option. Sewing the Pillow Cover Apply fabric glue to the bottom inside edge on the side of the tea towel. Press the top inside edge against it. Ensure the seams are matched all the way down the side as you press them together. This is the no-sew option. Repeat on the opposite side. Leave your glue to set according to package directions. Sew the sides of the pillow sham together. Sew just inside where the top and bottom selvedge seams meet on the sides, or with approximately a one-half inch (0.6cm) seam allowance. Backstitch on the top and bottom to ensure a sturdy stitch. Clip the excess thread off your seams. Turn the pillow cover inside out through the overlapping center. Push the corners out with your hand. Insert the pillow form. Sew buttons on the bottom of the back flap and cut buttonholes on the top of the back flap if there is puckering between the overlapping layers. Insert the buttons through the buttonholes to hold the flaps flush. Wash the pillow cover along with your normal towels when dirty.",
