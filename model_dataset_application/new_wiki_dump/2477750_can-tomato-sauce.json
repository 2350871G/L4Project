In general, Roma tomatoes tend to work well for canned sauces because they contain less water and create a thicker sauce. Beefsteak, lemon boy, and better boy varieties also work well. Regardless of the type used, the tomatoes should be ripe and firm. Avoid using tomatoes that are mushy, bruised, or rotten. Boil the tomatoes whole. Set a large pot of water to a boil. Plunge each tomato into the boiling water for 30 to 45 seconds before removing it with a heat-resistant spoon or tongs. Quickly dip the tomatoes into a bowl of ice water. Immediately after the tomatoes are removed from the boiling water, they should be plunged into a bowl of ice water. This loosens the skins, making them easier to peel off for your sauce. Slide the skins off. You should be able to remove the skins by peeling them back with your fingers at this point, but if not, you can slide a smooth, sharp knife in between the skin and the meat of the tomato to begin the process. Cut the tomatoes into halves. Remove the stem and the tough parts around the stem. Also remove any bruised, soft sections of the tomato. Scoop out the seeds and squeeze out the water. Hold each tomato half over a sink or extra bowl. Gently squeeze the half to drain it of excess water and the remove a good portion of the seeds.

Removing as much moisture as possible will leave you with a much thicker sauce, and it will also reduce the amount of cooking time needed to create the sauce. Making the Sauce Heat the oil inside a large stockpot. The pot will need to be able to contain at least 4 quarts (4 liters) in order to cook the entire batch at once. Heat the oil over medium-high heat. Wait one or two minutes before continuing to allow the oil to heat up appropriately. Add the onions to the hot oil. Cook them for 5 to 10 minutes or until lightly browned. Stir frequently to promote even cooking and to reduce burning. Add the garlic, salt, and pepper. Stir the new ingredients into the onions until evenly distributed. Allow the mixture to cook for another minute or two. Add the tomatoes, sugar, and basil. Give the contents of the stockpot a good mix. Due to the large volume of tomatoes, it may take a few minutes of stirring before you see that the ingredients have mixed together evenly. Heat to a boil. Reduce heat and allow the tomato mixture to simmer. Simmering the mixture for 15 to 30 minutes should be enough to break the tomatoes down and create a chunky sauce. You may need to simmer the sauce longer if you want something a little thinner, though. For a thinner sauce, allow the contents to simmer until the volume is reduced by one-third. For a thick, smooth sauce, simmer until the contents are reduced by one-half. Remove from heat. After the sauce reaches your desired consistency, remove the pot from the heat. Canning the Sauce Place a funnel into the mouth of each jar. If you do not have enough funnels for each jar, you can use the same funnel for all of them. Simply fill one jar before removing the funnel and using it to fill the next. Pour the sauce into the jars. Use a large ladle to make the process cleaner and easier. Fill the jars, leaving only 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) of headspace or empty space at the top of each jar. Add lemon juice to each jar. Stir in 2 Tbsp (60 ml) of lemon juice into each of the three quart-size jars of tomato sauce. Lemon juice is a strong natural preservative and will keep your tomato sauce from spoiling more effectively. Screw the lids onto the jars. Make sure that the lids are tightly secured, but avoid over-tightening them since doing so may cause the lids to pop off their tracks. Wipe away any excess tomato sauce with a clean, dry towel. Place the jars inside of a boiling-water canner. Make sure that they are well positioned so that they do not slide around or strike against each other. Fill the canner with enough water to completely cover the jars with at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water. Bring the water to a boil before you start the time. Alternatively, you can use a clean stockpot to boil the jars, as well. You may need to place a rack or a dish towel into the bottom of the pot to prevent the jars from sliding around, however. Cover the canner and boil until the jars are sealed. The amount of time you need to boil the jars for will vary depending on the altitude you live at. Boil for 40 minutes if you are at an altitude of 1000 feet (304.8 m) or less. Boil for 45 minutes at an altitude between 1,000 feet (304.8 m) and 3000 feet (304.8 m and 914.4 m).

Allow them to dry and cool in a draft-free area overnight. Do not let the jars touch as they cool. Check the seal. Press the center \"button\" on each lid. If it does not move, the jars are sealed. If it moves up and down or makes a popping sound, the jars have not sealed. You will need to reheat the contents of the jar before attempting to can them again.",
