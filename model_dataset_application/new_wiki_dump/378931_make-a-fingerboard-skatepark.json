  "text":" Making a Ramp Cut a piece of cardboard into a rectangle. Cut two squares, making the sides as long as the thin side of the rectangle. Size the rectangle to match the fingerboard's proportions. Tape the squares together on one side. Tape the rectangle's short end on one of the sides of the square, opposite the other square. Tape the rectangles other end to the far square's furthermost end. Make sure the rectangle curves inward. Cut another square the same size. Tape two of its sides to the other two squares sides on one end of the rectangle. Cut the excess cardboard off. Tape the side of the end to the curved rectangle. Repeat these steps on the other side. Making a Rail Cut three squares. Cut one square in half diagonally. Tape the two remaining squares together.Tape the triangles onto the squares so you have a standing triangle thing. Cut a long strip of cardboard the width of the squares. Tape it to the square on the bottom. Fold it up so that it rests on the triangle. Then tape the two sides to the end triangle. Cut the excess off and tape the final side.  Make three small thin rolls of cardboard an inch (2.5cm) tall. Tape them upright on the long side of the triangle. Place one in the middle, and the others halfway between the middle and the edge. Make one last roll, between the width of the squares and the length of the rectangle. Then tape it to the posts. Making a Ground Rail Make a roll about 8 inches (20.3 cm) long.  Make two one-inch (2.5cm) rolls. Tape them about one inch (2.5cm) from each end of the 8 inch (20.3 cm) roll. Cut two 1\u20132 inch (2.5\u20135.1 cm) squares, and tape them to the short posts.  Making Stairs Cut four squares about 6 inches (15.2 cm). Tape two of them together. On the other two, draw a pattern that looks like stairs. Make each step about 1 inch (2.5 cm) tall. Start about one inch (2.5cm) from any corner. Cut the pattern out, and keep the two bigger pieces. Tape them as for the triangles of the grind rail.  Cut 12 6-inch (15cm) by one-inch (2.5cm) rectangles. Tape them into the places on the front of the stairs. Forming a Bowl Cut 21 squares and 4 rectangles. Make 4 ramps using the rectangles and 8 squares. Don't bother making sides. Tape the bottom of each ramp to another square in the middle.  Note that at  each empty corner, make a corner by putting three squares on the floor in the arrangement of an L. Tape the edges together, and stand up the two on the ends of the L. Tape them together to make a corner, and tape it to the ramps. Do this for each corner. Make a triangle, to put in each corner. This is tricky, because the sides have to be curved correctly, but not at a wrong angle. A good idea is to cut a big rectangle, tape one side correctly, then cut off the excess and cut the rest. Creating a Half Pipe Make 2 good, solid ramps.  Put the two bottom edges together (the places where you would start going up the ramp).  Turn both the ramps over so you see the bottom.  Tape the bottom edges together on the bottom.  Turn the ramps over, so you see the top again.  Tape the edges together again, this side on the top.  Using a Sink as the Whole Skatepark Find a sink. Any sort of sink. You can use that sink as a bowl for the fingerboard. Get some 300-400 page paperback books.  Open the books so they can be used as a mini ramp directly adjacent to each other. Make sure the covers of the books are facing each other. This creates a mini ramp. Get the handles from some drawers or cupboards. These can be the rails. If you can't get drawer or cupboard handles, squish a ruler between two books. Stack some books on top of each other to create a staircase.  Have fun in your homemade skatepark in a sink!  Buying Pre-Made Pieces Visit online stores that sell toys or miniature items or visit an auction/trading site.  Search for something like \"Tech Deck Ramps\".  Wait until the list of results comes up. Read the titles, and select the items that are what you want. Read the description. Read carefully to see exactly what it has. If a used item, look at the pictures carefully to see if it has any damage. Email the seller to ask whether there is any damage, and to see if all parts are included, etc. Good things to look for are bowls, ramps, rails, stairs, etc.",
