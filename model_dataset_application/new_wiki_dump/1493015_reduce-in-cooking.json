Other reductions like gravy will require multiple ingredients such as salt, spices, flour, and milk or water. There\u2019s no one right way to decide what ingredients you want to reduce. You can reduce any liquid you want in cooking. If you\u2019re unsure of what you want to reduce, just wait until you encounter a recipe that requires a reduction and follow the directions.

Generally, you can start your reduction with about 1.5 to 2 times your desired volume of liquid. For instance, if you want 2 cups (473 milliliters) of a particular sauce, start your reduction with 3 or 4 cups (709 to 946 milliliters) of liquid. The precise amount of liquid you\u2019ll need to reduce in order to achieve a sauce with the consistency you wish depends on the contents of the liquid you reduce, as well as the conditions under which you reduce it."

If you\u2019re reducing less than 1 cup (236 milliliters) of liquid, stand by and keep an eye on it as it reduces. The precise amount of time necessary to achieve a reduction with your desired consistency depends on the type of liquid you\u2019re reducing, the volume of liquid you begin with, and the conditions under which you cook it. Most reductions require 15-30 minutes. If you\u2019re working from a recipe, the recipe should provide estimates for how much time the reduction requires."

To easily figure out how much the liquid has reduced, subtract the current elevation of the liquid from the level it was at when you began the reduction. If your recipe tells you to reduce by 1/4, for instance, reduce the liquid until the final volume of your sauce or cooking liquid is at 3/4 the depth it was when you began. If you wish to track your reduction more accurate, pour it into a large measuring cup periodically to determine how much it has reduced, then return it to the pan if you wish to continue reducing it."

If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll end up with a more boozy flavor than you would otherwise. Reducing wine will cut down on its overall acidity. Simmer canned tomatoes from the start to concentrate flavor. Canned tomatoes have already been processed with heat, so if you\u2019re trying to reduce a sauce with canned tomatoes, there\u2019s no need to bring them to a boil beforehand.
