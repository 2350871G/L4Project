  "text":" Cooking the caramel mixture Grease the cooking pot lightly with butter.  Turn on a TV show and place in a position that is viewable while stirring.  Place a cold glass of water and vanilla next to the stove top.  Combine the sugar, brown sugar, corn syrup, evaporated milk, whipping cream, and 1 cup of butter in the pot.  Stir constantly over medium high heat with a wooden mixing spoon. Stir until the mixture is smooth and begins to bubble. Check the sides of the pot for visible sugar granules. If there are granules, use a plastic spatula to scrape them off the side of the pot. Stir for ten minutes.  Testing the caramel mixture Test whether the caramel mixture is ready. Drip one drop of mixture into a cold cup of water using a wooden spoon. Remove the mixture from the water if the sugar forms a ball that does not flatten when removed from the water. Proceed to the next step. If the sugar forms a ball that does not flatten when removed from the water, proceed to the next step. If the mixture dissolves in the water, or forms a ball that flattens in your hand, continue to stir and repeat the testing process in 5 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat.  Shaping the caramels Carefully pour the caramel mixture into the prepared pan.  Allow the mixture to cool completely while you take a break.  Apply oil to the blade of a knife. When the blade starts to starts to stick to the caramel, reapply oil to the blade each time. Cut a sheet of caramel into one inch (2.5cm) wide strips.
