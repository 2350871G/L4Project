          "description":"Whenever you view an eBay product, there is box on the right side of the screen with the seller\u2019s overall score. There are two pieces of information in this box. The first is a star with a number next to it. That number is the amount of feedback ratings the seller has. The second is a percentage of seller ratings that are positive. Together, these give you a quick glance of the overall strength of a seller. A seller with at least 10 positive feedback ratings gets a yellow star from eBay, which appears next to their name on the product page. This indicates that the seller is established on the platform. Stars change color as the seller gets more positive feedback ratings. A seller with at least a yellow star is on the right track and you can be confident in their service. Generally, look for sellers that have a higher number of feedback ratings. If you\u2019re looking at a product and the seller has 300 feedback ratings and a positive feedback score of 98%, it indicates a very reputable seller. You don\u2019t have to investigate this seller further. If, however, the seller has few or no feedback ratings, you should do more investigating before buying the item. This isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, because a seller might just be new. But scam accounts also have few ratings, so look for more information."

          "description":"If you want more information after seeing the seller\u2019s quick rating, click on their username on the product page. This brings you to their seller profile where you can read all of their past feedback and look at all the items they have on sale. Click around their seller profile for a fuller picture of their reputation."

          "headline":"Assess the seller\u2019s 4 feedback categories under their profile picture.",
          "description":"eBay sellers are graded in 4 categories: Item as Described, Communication, Shipping Time, and Shipping Charges. Each of these categories is ranked from 0 to 50. Check how this seller measures up in each category. Most good sellers on eBay rank above 40 in each of these categories. Someone below that could be an unreliable seller or be weak in that category. Some categories might mean less to you than others. For example, you might not mind paying a higher shipping fee but care a lot about the item being exactly as the seller described it. Consider what your values are when you assess the seller\u2019s ranking."

Under the \u201cRecent Feedback Ratings\u201d tab, you\u2019ll see the breakdown of positive, neutral, and negative reviews that the seller received over the past year. For a reliable seller, the majority of these reviews would be positive. If a seller has a higher amount of negative reviews than positive, avoid the seller. For more information, read some of the reviews the seller has received. This gives you a comprehensive idea of the type of seller they are."

          "description":"Even good sellers get some negative feedback, especially if they\u2019ve been selling for several years. If a seller has a few negative reviews and you\u2019d like to know more, click \u201cNegative\u201d under \u201cRecent Feedback Ratings\u201d to read all their negative reviews. Use these reviews to understand the circumstances that led to the seller receiving bad feedback. For a reputable seller, negative reviews are rare and due to uncharacteristic failures. There are some red flags to look for in a negative review. If a buyer complains that the seller described an item as new and it arrived opened and damaged, then the seller is potentially untrustworthy. A reputable seller would accurately describe the item. Some buyers may have unreasonable criticisms, so be sure to take that into account. For example, \u201cDidn\u2019t ship within an hour of me buying the item\u201d is an unreasonable criticism. If you see reviews like this, the seller is still probably reputable."

          "description":"Prices are usually cheaper online, and eBay is known for good deals, but there are some deals that should raise a red flag. Some scam sellers make new accounts to list very valuable items for enormous discounts. These items could be counterfeit, broken, or stolen, and the seller will describe them as new. Do more investigating if you see deals that seem too good to be true. For example, you might see a seller offering a new iPhone for significantly cheaper than all the other iPhones on eBay. This is a red flag, and you should question why a seller could offer a new iPhone so far below the normal market price. It is an even bigger red flag if the account has few or no reviews. Very cheap items are not necessarily a negative thing. Someone may be moving soon and just has to get rid of items fast. But it is a reason to do more investigating."

          "description":"eBay allows sellers to upload their own photos of the item they're selling. If they upload a stock photo from a website or the product manufacturer, this is a red flag because they may be trying to hide the actual condition of their item. If you see an item using a generic stock photo, look into the seller's feedback to ensure that they are reputable. This is especially important for used and collectible items when the condition is very important. If you can't see the actual item for sale, there is a chance it's damaged or not in the condition that the user is describing."

This is a good sign. Sellers that specialize in one category are usually professionals and take selling very seriously. They will work hard to deliver your items and handle any issues that arise. Having a lot of different items is, again, not necessarily a negative thing. People often use eBay to clean out their garages and homes, and naturally have many diverse items for sale. But this usually means they aren\u2019t professional sellers and might be less skilled or willing to deliver the best service possible. Having one high-value item for sale and nothing else is a bigger red flag. This could be a fake seller profile that someone is using to unload damaged products."
