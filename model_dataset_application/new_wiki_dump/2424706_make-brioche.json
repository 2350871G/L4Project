Mix slowly for at least 10 minutes or until it is smooth and elasticized. The dough will be very weak and moist. For a brioche, weak and moist is exactly how you want it. This is quite a wet dough, so a mixer makes the job easier; however if mixing by hand, mix everything in the bowl except the butter until it comes together and tip it onto a clean surface. Crumble the butter onto the dough and using the heel of the palm of your hand, gently push the dough and butter together until the dough is formed. Fold the dough like you would make a book fold in puff pastry will give a little extra strength to the dough, but it will remain a very soft dough. Refrain from adding extra flour to make it come together quickly as that will reduce the quality of the loaf - a little light dusting of the surface is ideal."

Brioche has been known to rise swiftly or very slowly, depending on the warmth of the dough and freshness and variety of the yeast. To be safe, refrigerate the dough overnight. Use a covered container -- cover with either plastic wrap, a wet cloth, or both. After this stage, you can freeze your dough if you need to use it at a later date. Just wrap it up tightly in plastic wrap and place it in the freezer. The sooner you use it, the better it'll be."
