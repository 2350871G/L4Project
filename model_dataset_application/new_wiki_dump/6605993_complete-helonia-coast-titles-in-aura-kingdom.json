The town of Helonia itself hosts four conversations within the borders while the other locations of the area hosting conversations are Bella\u2019s Orchard, Silverash Shores, Windmill Cottage and the Emeralden Mountains. Bella\u2019s Orchard, due northwest of town, has two. Silverash Shores, otherwise known as the beach south of town, has one. Windmill Cottage just north of town has one. Emeralden Mountains, in the furthest part of the map due north-east, has one right beside the portal to the next town."

For eavesdropping in all conversations, you will be awarded the \u201cHelonia Beach Bum\u201d title. This grants you +3 EVA (evasion) when you equip it. For those that like getting up close and personal in battle but dislike the ensuing pain, this boost would be small, but definitely appreciated. Achievements are merely bragging rights, but Titles carry bonuses to your stats! You can equip titles through the Character menu, symbolized by a head wearing a helmet in your menu bar.

The boss monsters are basically bigger versions of the usual monsters of their area, as well as more powerful. If you meet them head-to-head at the same level, you\u2019re bound to win! Though it will be a bit challenging, they\u2019re not as difficult as they seem. You can keep beating these boss monsters and receive the reward multiple times, but you can only get the achievement and the title once. They respawn somewhat randomly upon being beaten, but they can always be found in their respective areas. You don\u2019t actually need to prepare anything special before fighting them. Players can normally beat them, regardless of Job Class, once they reach or pass the level of the boss. It is advised though to keep up-to-date with your level\u2019s equipment restrictions and to carry Potions with you, just in case you\u2019re hit by a critical or feel somewhat wary of them."
