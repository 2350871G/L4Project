          "description":"Place an oven rack on the highest level and preheat the oven to high broil. Place the red pepper on a small baking tray and cook it under the broiler for 20 to 25 minutes. Turn the pepper every five minutes to ensure it cooks evenly. The pepper is ready when it\u2019s soft, cooked through, and blackened on the outside. You can also roast the pepper directly on the element of a gas stove instead of under the broiler. Place the pepper over a medium\u2013high flame and cook it for about 10 minutes, turning occasionally. When the pepper is done, remove it from the oven or the gas, transfer it to a heat proof bowl, and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Leave the pepper to steam and cool for about 20 minutes. When it\u2019s cool, peel away the skin with your fingers and remove the seeds. Discard the skin and seeds."

Turn the seeds often to prevent burning, and continue toasting for about three minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and pour the seeds into a spice grinder. Pulse a few times, until the seeds have been ground to a powder. You can also use a pestle and mortar to grind the seeds."

Add the onion, garlic, and chilies to the pan and cook them for about 10 minutes. You want the ingredients to take on a smoky color and start to caramelize. Any red chilies will do for this recipe, and you can regulate the spiciness of the harissa with different chilies. Mild red chilies include ancho, paprika, chipotle, and cascabel chilies. Medium-hot red chilies include cayenne, Thai, tabasco, and habanero chilies. Hot red chilies include the Bhut jolokia (ghost pepper) and the Trinidad scorpion."

Continue blending until you have a smooth paste. Add extra olive oil as necessary to keep the blender moving. Additional ingredients you can add at this stage include a few sun dried tomatoes or a couple leaves of fresh mint.
