  "text":" Estimating Shingles Find the square footage of the roof. Measure the length and width of each portion of the roof, multiply length by width for each plane, and then add the planes together for the total square footage. Determine the total number of squares. Divide the total footage by 100 to determine the number of \u201csquares\u201d in the roof. Determine the bundles of shingles needed to cover the roof. It takes three bundles to cover a square if you use 3-tab shingles, the most common type. Account for waste. Add 10 percent to the shingle estimate to account for waste. If your roof has hips and valleys, make it 15 percent because of waste in cutting shingles to fit the valleys. Estimating Felt Underlayment (Tar Paper) Find the square footage of the roof. Measure the length and width of each portion of the roof, multiply length by width for each plane, and add the planes together for the total square footage. Find the number of squares. Roofers measure surfaces in squares of 100 feet (30.75 square meters). Divide the total footage by 100 to find the number of squares in the roof. Determine the number of rolls of underlayment needed. The #15 type is most commonly used, and one roll of #15 underlayment covers 4 squares. If you\u2019re using #15 underlayment and your roof slope is greater than 4:12, use 1 layer. If the slope is between 3:12 and 4:12, double the amount and put down 2 layers. Estimating Other Materials Measure for drip edge. This metal strip, which goes beneath the underlayment, protects the edge of the roof from rot. You'll need the measurements of the rakes and eaves of the roof (side edges and bottom edge). Use a rake edge for the side of the house as well. Estimate how many roofing nails you'll need. At 4 nails per shingle, that\u2019s about 320 nails per square. For high-wind areas, use 6 nails per shingle, or 480 nails per square.

While you can order special hip and ridge cap shingles, you can make your own by cutting a 3-tab shingle into 3 pieces. A bundle of 3-tab shingles will cover 35 lineal feet (9.2 m).
