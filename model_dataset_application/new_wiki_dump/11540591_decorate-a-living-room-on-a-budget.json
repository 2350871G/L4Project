          "description":"Potted plants will always be an excellent and inexpensive choice for decorative purposes. Plants that can be grown indoors come in a huge variety of types, shapes, sizes, and even colours. You can find plants in all sorts of stores in your local area. Some plants already come in decorative pots, but if you have to get a decorative pot, you can buy inexpensive ones at the store or even use terra cotta pots from a garden centre (which can be painted). Do a little bit of research before purchasing your plants. Make sure you get plants that can thrive in your living room based on the amount of light it receives. Don\u2019t forget to water your plants based on the instructions they come with. If you think you\u2019ll forget, you can buy pots or bulbs that allow the plant to self-water itself over several weeks."

          "description":"Many items you already have in your living room can be changed or altered in such a way as to give it a whole new look at a very low cost. For example, buying or making new pillow covers; replacing door and drawer knobs, light and outlet covers, or vent covers; glueing or sewing jewels, buttons, or sequins to pillows or lamps; or installing doors on bookshelves. You could even sew fancy trim onto your throw pillows or lampshades to add flare. Don\u2019t be afraid to use stencils on the wall, floor, ceiling, or furniture to add shapes and colours with paint."

          "description":"New lighting of any kind can add new dimensions of light to your living room that can really change its look. You can purchase new light fixtures or lamps to add to your room or even fixtures and lamps that are \u2018new to you.\u2019 You can also update existing lamps and light fixtures by adding or removing elements. For example, keep the same lamp, but change or paint the lampshade, or remove your overhead light fixtures and replace it with multiple floor lamps. Even changing the type or wattage of the light bulbs you use can make a huge difference. If you want to add atmosphere, but don\u2019t need to use the light to read, use bulbs with lower wattage to provide a more subtle light."

          "description":"Hang new (or new to you) curtains or blinds in your living room to alter the whole look and feel. Use curtain rods that are wider than your window or install curtain rods much higher than a window to make the window seem bigger. Widen the trim around your window to also make the window look larger. Avoid painting your walls and window trim the same colour, or the window won\u2019t stand out. Don\u2019t be afraid to layer blinds and curtains on the same window. The curtains may end up decorative, but the blinds may be practical."

They can also be used as the \u2018anchor\u2019 to bring all the pieces of your room together. For example, use the colours found in your area rug to decorate the whole room and the carpet will tie it all together. Try to obtain a rug that is the right size for your living room. Alternatively, you could combine multiple area rugs to create one larger rug or create multiple living areas within your living room."

Purchase any kind of paint to use on the canvas, or reuse some paint you already have at home. Paint the canvas using any type of brush or sponge, or drip or splatter paint onto it. Once dry, hang your personal artwork on the wall of your living room. Canvases can be hung with a simple nail or hook on the wall or leaned against the wall from a floating shelf or fireplace mantle. Use one or more colour on the canvas that matches the various items you\u2019ve used in your living room in order to pull those multiple pieces together. For example, if you have a dark blue rug, a light green chair, and yellow throw cushions, use all three colours in your painting. You can paint one large canvas or multiple smaller-sized canvases."

Hang framed or canvas-wrapped photos of different sizes over the vast majority of that wall. Hang each photo randomly, don\u2019t worry about creating a pattern. You can also use artwork on your gallery wall, either artwork you\u2019ve created yourself or that you\u2019ve purchased. You can hang empty, yet unique, frames to your gallery wall if you\u2019d like. Or hang items other than photos or artwork within these empty frames (e.g., jewellery, stained glass, clocks, books)."
