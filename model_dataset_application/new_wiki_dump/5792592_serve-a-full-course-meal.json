          "description":"Multiple course dinners take a lot of time to cook. If you plan ahead, you will leave yourself plenty of time to cook every course. When creating your menu, choose one or two items that will be prepared fresh and cook the others in advance. Soups, pasta sauces, gravies, and bread can be cooked and stored the day before before the meal. Choose recipes that use different cooking equipment. For example, if all of your recipes are made in the oven, you may run out of time to cook everything.

VT\t\t\t\t\tVanna Tran\t\t\tExperienced Cook\t\t\t\tVanna Tran, experienced cook, advises: \"If serving each course individually, think ahead about how long it will take to prepare and plate each dish. Rather than prepare each course right before it is served, it might make more sense to begin preparing a plate one or two courses beforehand \u2014 especially if there are elements in a dish that will take a long time.\""

          "headline":"Set the table before you start cooking.",
          "description":"This will give you lots of time to prepare the food without feeling rushed when your guests arrive. The way you set your table will depend on how many courses you planned. For example:\nSet down a placemat and a charger plate at every chair. The charger plate will stay in place until the dessert course is served. Place the dessert utensils horizontally above the charger plate. Set the utensils in the order they will be used. Silverware that will be used first goes on the outside, and those that will be used last are next to the plate. Goblets and wine glasses are set near the top-right corner of the placemat. Desserts plates and coffee cups are usually brought in after the other courses are finished."

          "description":"Cold dishes such as salads or gazpachos can be covered in plastic wrap and stored in your refrigerator. Warm dishes can be covered with foil and placed in the oven to stay warm. Make sure your oven is set to the lowest temperature. Most ovens have a \u201cwarm\u201d setting. This setting will keep your food warm without burning it."

          "description":"Catering a full meal can be expensive. However, if you hire someone else to cook, clean, and serve the meal, you will be able to enjoy your evening with your guests instead of slaving in the kitchen. If you can\u2019t afford to hire full service catering, ask local catering companies if they have service-only packages. You will cook the food but waiters will come to your house and serve the meal."

If you do too many, you might not have time to prepare everything properly or spend time with your guests. Remember that each course will require its own plate or bowl and silverware. Make sure you have enough of each to serve your courses. A three-course meal usually has an appetizer, a main course, and a dessert. A four course meal might include a soup, an appetizer, a main course, and dessert. A five course meal can include a soup, an appetizer, a salad, a main course, and a dessert. A six course meal usually includes an amuse-bouche, a soup, an appetizer, a salad, a main course, and a dessert.
