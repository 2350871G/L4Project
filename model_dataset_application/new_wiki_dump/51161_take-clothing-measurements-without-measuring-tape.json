          "description":"Look for an object that you have on hand that has an even, known length to allow for easy measuring. Depending on the object, you can either use it to directly measure on your body, or to measure the length of another material like string. For instance, a standard American printer paper size is 8.5 inches wide by 11 inches long. An American dollar bill is 2.5 inches wide by 6 inches long. You can also look up the size written on the bottom of a baking pan, a box, or another object that you can easily find the exact dimensions of."

          "headline":"Mark increments on the material.",
          "description":"If you don\u2019t already know the exact length of the material you\u2019re using in place of measuring tape, use a flat ruler to mark increments on it. If you use a material that is long, you can mark off every 6 or 12 inches on it to measure longer lengths of the body, like inseam. On shorter material like a piece of paper or dollar bill, you can simply use it to measure one length at a time, or fold it in halves to measure smaller increments. If you don\u2019t have a ruler, you can measure lengths with standard objects like printer paper or a dollar bill. Or, approximate lengths using your hand and arm. The distance from your first knuckle to the end of your fingertip is about 1 inch, the distance across your palm underneath the fingers is about 4 inches, and the distance from elbow to fingertips is about 18 inches. However, these approximations vary on each body."

          "headline":"Lay the material on the body for measurement.",
          "description":"Place your material across or around the part of the body you want to measure to find its length based on your marks or understanding of the material\u2019s length. If your material is too short to span the length of the area, place your finger as precisely as possible where the material ends and begin there with another length of the material, doing this as many times as you have to to reach the full length of the area. If you want to find the length of an area of your body beforehand and then measure it afterward, place it on the area of your body you want to measure and carefully take hold of the material (or even cut it if it is a material like string) where the length of your body ends. Then use a ruler or approximate measurements from your hand to determine the length. Make sure you write down all numbers and label them with the body measurement they correspond to."

Ensure that you do not pull whatever material you\u2019re using to measure too tightly around the chest.

Find this point by observing where the torso creases when bending side to side, and note that it will fall above the bellybutton and below the ribcage. Note that there is a difference between the natural waist and where the waistband may be worn on pants, skirts, or shorts. When clothing measurements call for a waist size, it refers to the narrowest part of the torso, the natural waist. You may want to take another measurement below the natural waist where you know you will wear a garment. Be sure to exhale and relax, or have the woman you\u2019re measuring do so, before you take a waist measurement. The abdomen shouldn\u2019t be enlarged with air, sucked in smaller, or otherwise in an unnatural or unrelaxed state."
