  "text":" Creating the M Curve Start up Photoshop with a new image. This one is 500 X 500. Select the Pen tool.  At the left side of your screen, in the middle, click and drag. In the screenshot, the green arrow is the starting point, then drag it upward. Release the mouse, move over and place the mouse at the next point and drag it down.  Without releasing the mouse button, press down the ALT (Option) key and go back up. This is basically changing the direction handle. This gives you an 'inverted U curve'. Do not deselect.  Joining the Path Click on a point below everything else and approximately in the middle. You will start to see the beginnings of a heart. Locate the point where you started the shape.  Click on it. This closes the path and gives you the basic heart shape. If the path will be closing, you will see a very small circle by your cursor. To manipulate it any further, you will need to move your direction handles around.  In the Paths dialog box, locate the small circle made of dotted lines. Click it. This converts the path to a selection that you can use to create your graphics. Right click on the layer with the path in it, and select Rasterize Layer. This is what will allow you to fill your selection with color. Right click on the Bucket tool and select Gradient Tool.
