Now that you have the enchantment that you want to use, you can add it to an offensive or defensive item (e.g., a sword or an armor piece). Place the item that you want to enchant on the anvil. It should go in the box on the far-left side. Add your enchanted book. Select the book, then select the middle box in the anvil's window. Move the enchanted item into your inventory.
