Add no more than a standard portion per person if you aren't a confident cook, add as much butter or butter substitute as you like if you've made mash successfully before. Kumara is tasty with or without butter. Ordinary potatoes can be a little bland without any butter. Add salt and pepper to taste. You can add whole egg, egg yolks, milk, cream, spring onions, cooked finely chopped white onions, grated or shredded cheese to the mash if desired."
