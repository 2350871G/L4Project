          "description":"Under-watering is a far more common problem than overwatering. As a general rule, each square foot of the landscape needs about 2-3 quarts of water weekly. Or, about 20 liters (5.3 US gal) per square meter. Put another way, it needs to receive at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of rain or water each week. Most trees need about 2-3 quarts of water once per week for every foot in height (spread evenly around its root system). Thus, a 20 feet (6.1 m) tall tree should get 40-60 quarts of water once per week. Or, about 18 liters (4.8 US gal) per week for a 6-meter tree."

          "description":"You can get these at most hardware stores or garden centers. This is a small investment compared to replacing thousands of dollars in landscaping. Most people fail in maintaining their landscape because they try watering all plants by hand. This usually leads to gross under-watering because of wrongly estimating watering needs. It is also massively time-consuming. Most sprinkler systems will hook up directly to your hose, making for simple installation. More complex underground sprinkler systems will usually need to be installed by a professional."

Depending on your home's water pressure and your sprinkling system, this can take anywhere from 30 to 120 minutes."

Setting up an automatic timer will shut off the water so you don't waste it. This also saves you many hours compared to hand watering."

During this same period, trees should get 6-9 quarts of water for every foot (about 3 liters per meter) in height, spread evenly around the roots. Water your landscape on a regular schedule even if it looks like it may rain. It's unlikely you will over-water your garden even if it does rain."

Trees should get 4-6 quarts of water for every foot in height, spread evenly around the roots. For each week thereafter, water once per week so the landscape gets 1 inch (2.5 cm) per week."
