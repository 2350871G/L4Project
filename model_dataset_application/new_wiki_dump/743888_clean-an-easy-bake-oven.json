It\u2019s not like a conventional oven. Don\u2019t douse the oven with water! Instead you want to lightly apply the cleaning solution to the rag or tissue. Or take some dish soap, and mix it with window/glass cleaner. Then dab this concoction onto your rag or tissue. You could try soap and water first, but if you\u2019ve got tougher stains or old food stuck in the oven, you might want to try the other approach. Take a wet towel, adding a little amount of dishwasher gel. Or add soap suds to the cloth. Wipe the inside and outside of the oven. Repeat this several times."

Leave the wet paste on the bottom of the oven for a couple of hours, depending on how greasy and dirty it is. Spray the oven with the same mix diluted to spray or with 20 Mule Team Borax, which can also be used in place of laundry detergent. Be sure to rinse well. You could also try using Clorox wipes. Clorox wipes are great to clean with, as well as magic erasers."

Put a little vinegar in a spray bottle and spritz everywhere. Another chemical-free option is to use lemon juice to clean the oven. Lemon juice will make it smell good and, if you add a bit liquid soap to the lemon juice, it will help to remove stains."

In a small bowl, mix 1/2 cup of baking soda with a few tablespoons of water. Adjust the ratio of both as needed until you have a spreadable paste. Coat your oven.
