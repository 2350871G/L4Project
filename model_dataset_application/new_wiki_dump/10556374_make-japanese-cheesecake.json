Put it in the microwave and heat the ingredients until the butter melts and the cream cheese softens. Avoid melting the cream cheese because this will make the mixture too hot.

To determine if you've beaten the whites until they have formed stiff peaks, turn off the mixer and lift a beater out of the whites.
