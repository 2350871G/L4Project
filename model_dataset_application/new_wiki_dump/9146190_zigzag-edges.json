It is fine to keep the defaults in place for the zigzag stitch on your machine. If your machine does not automatically adjust the width and length of the stitch for you, then start with a stitch length of 1.4 and a stitch width of 5.0."

Start by using light pressure on the pedal and check the stitches to see if they are coming out how you want them to. If you are unhappy with the placement of the stitches, then stop the machine and adjust the position of the fabric.

This will help to reduce fraying when you wash and wear the garment. Trim along the edge of the zigzag stitch, but be careful not to cut into the stitching."

If you are not sure how you want your zigzags to look, then try experimenting on some scrap fabric before you begin sewing your project. Try short, medium and long lengths and widths to find a zigzag setting that you like. It may be helpful to write each setting directly onto the scrap fabric so you know what each one will look like. This will make it easier to decide on a preferred setting and serve as a helpful reference for future projects."

The zigzag edge that you sew into the hem will be decorative and functional. However, finishing raw edges with the zigzag stitch is also a good strategy. The zigzag stitching will help to prevent the edges of your finished product from fraying from normal wash and wear."
