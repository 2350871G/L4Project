Once you finish one small section, move over and work on the next one, always starting at the ridge and working down to the gutters.

Fill your pressure washer with an anti-moss/fungicide cleaning solution, mixing it as the product instructs. Use a low psi to spray the tiles with the treatment, starting on one side and slowly working your way to the opposite side of your roof. There are many products available at hardware stores to treat your tile roof. Make sure it includes a fungicide and advertises that it kills organic growth.

Direct the spray at the top of the ridge and spray downward so that the treatment runs off the roof, taking moss, lichen and dirt along with it. Spend a little extra time on the areas with the most moss and staining; the pressure of the water will loosen any stubborn remains."
