If you bought \"raw\" almonds, or uncooked almonds, then this will be necessary to get the perfect crunch. That said, some people prefer a little chew in their candied almonds, and these people can skip pre-roasting. You can place the almonds in the oven as it pre-heats, speeding up the process. If you bought already-roasted almonds, be sure to skip this step! You might be better off making stovetop candied almonds."
