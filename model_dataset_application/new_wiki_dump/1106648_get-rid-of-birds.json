          "description":"Purchase a premade one from your local craft or garden store. Or, make your own by constructing a cross out of wood and then covering it with clothes stuffed with straw. Place your scarecrow in the vicinity of the pesky birds and watch them fly away. Move your scarecrow around every few days to keep the birds from getting too comfortable with it. Changing up the clothes can help as well."

          "headline":"Place decoys throughout the property.",
          "description":"Buy a number of cheap, plastic animal decoys. Choose natural predators of birds, such as snakes, owls, swans, and even coyotes. Set one or two of these up around the perimeter of the bird-infested area. Rotate them out with fresh ones every few days to keep the birds on edge."

          "headline":"Activate water deterrents.",
          "description":"This solution is not feasible in every space, but can be a great tool to keep birds away from decks or pools. Install a motion-activated sprinkler aimed at the area of concern. Purchase one online or at your local garden store. Every time a bird tries to land, a spray of water will scare them away. Don\u2019t worry about the strength of the water stream. This is a harmless way of keeping an area bird-free."

          "headline":"Hang balloons.",
          "description":"Get a number of balloons with faces on them and hang these throughout the bird-infested space. Tie the balloons tightly to branches or posts so that they don\u2019t fly away. Add some flyaway pieces of shiny ribbon for even more effect. Rotate everything every few days to keep the birds uneasy."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use shiny or reflective materials.",
          "description":"Cut out strips of aluminum foil and hang them from the trees or shrubs. Punch holes in thin aluminum disposable pans and do the same thing. Hanging shiny CDs or reflective tape is another way to deter birds. Make sure that you leave plenty of room for these objects to spin around and move, as this will scare birds even more. There is also a product called \u201coptical fire gel\u201d that mimics the appearance of moving flames. This can be applied to the edges of buildings to deter landing or roosting. Metallic spinning propellers sold at most garden centers do an excellent job of ridding an area of birds."

          "headline":"Play bird distress calls.",
          "description":"Get a CD of these sounds and play it near to the infested area. You may need to boost up the volume to reach up into the highest trees. Although it may be a hassle, playing these noises for numerous evenings in a row will get you the best results. Starlings, grackles, and other pest birds have been known to move roosts due to harassing noises."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use a dog.",
          "description":"Border collies, sheepdogs, and other breeds enjoy chasing birds and are very good at it. Hire a trained dog handler to patrol your bird-infested space or borrow a friend\u2019s dog and do it yourself. Walk the dog in the early morning and early evening hours when birds are most active. For example, a single sheepdog walking up and down a beach line at peak hours can reduce gull numbers almost 99 percent. Keep the dog from harming any birds by only walking it with a secure harness and leash."

        {
          "headline":"Bring in a raptor.",
          "description":"Contact your local zoo or wildlife refuge and ask for the information for a falconer, a trainer who works with falcons and other birds of prey. The falconer will likely charge an hourly rate to come out to your site. They will let their falcon or hawk fly around and scare away any smaller birds. This is a great option for areas where the birds are no longer frightened by decoys or less aggressive methods. However, it can get expensive, with multiple treatments averaging around $55 an hour. There are also kites available that resemble birds of prey. Some people have been successful when flying these over bird infested areas."

Empty the water out of any bird baths and fill in any standing pools of water. To keep away the scavengers, secure your trashcan lids carefully and cover up your compost pits."

Maintain this level of upkeep after the birds leave, so that your lawn doesn\u2019t attract another flock."

        {
          "headline":"Install bird netting.",
          "description":"Look at your local garden or hardware store for nylon or plastic mesh. Use stakes or posts to create a framework for the netting around any trees that need protecting. Drape the netting on top of any vulnerable bushes. Use netting to block off potential nest sites on buildings, like rafters. Four-inch (10 cm) mesh is large enough to block out crows and other large birds. Go with a finer, smaller mesh if you are trying to dissuade tiny birds. Before you place the mesh, move the foliage aside and look into the interior of the bushes or trees to make sure that no birds will be trapped inside."

Use cinder blocks spread along the sides as line anchors. This will not stop birds from landing, but it will keep them from building large nests. Check the filament every so often to make sure that the lines are still intact."

          "headline":"Install bird spikes.",
          "description":"Buy a few strips of metal spikes, also called perch blockers, and attach them to any potential roosting or perching areas. Most people put them on ledges, around gutters, at the edges of roofs, and on top of patio covers. The strips usually attach to your structure with glue or screws."

This is a great option for the edges of signs or ledges, as they can be purchased in a number of colors and thicknesses. Some strips run off traditional electrical or battery power while others can be set up to store and use solar energy."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use a spray or paste repellant.",
          "description":"Purchase the repellant and then smear it on any problem areas, such as ledges or eaves. Go slowly and make sure to leave no spaces untreated. While there is no scientific backing that this method works, some people argue that the scent alone is enough to drive birds away. Some of these repellants can stain surfaces. If you are worried about this, put down a layer of tape and then follow it with the repellant."

Push a piece of copper mesh or steel wool into them. Cover this plug with a piece of wood, metal, or mesh. Seal up your gutters and vents as well with mesh screens. Don\u2019t just use caulk to seal up the holes, as birds can easily peck this out."

For example, certain states in the U.S. allow citizens to shoot pigeons and sparrows as a control measure. However, you\u2019ll need to check your local laws as well since some jurisdictions do not permit shooting wildlife in residential areas.
