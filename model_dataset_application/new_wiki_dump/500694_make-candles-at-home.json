As you roll, make sure to keep the edges even and keep the rolling wax tight around the wick. For the tightest roll, try placing a piece of waxed paper between your fingers and the beeswax. Keep the waxed paper moving so that it doesn\u2019t get stuck in the rolled beeswax. Using the waxed paper will also protect the beeswax from the warmth of your fingers, which can complicate the roll by softening the wax so much that it comes hard to work with."

If the wax is too hard to work with, use the \u201clow\u201d heat setting on your hair dryer to soften it up. The first candle is complete. Repeat the exact same actions with the second square of beeswax to create the second candle."

          "description":"If you aren\u2019t using pre-primed wicks, you\u2019ll need to prime yours before lighting the candles. Priming will keep the wick rigid, which means it will burn better. You do this by soaking the wick in wax, which removes any air bubbles that might exist. The easiest way to prime is to use two small pieces of wax sheet and simply press them around the wicks. An alternate method is melting paraffin wax in a double boiler over medium heat. Once it\u2019s melted, dip the ends of the wicks into the wax for 5 seconds. Allow them to cool completely before lighting them."

When lit, the flames should be about 1 to 2 inches high. The wax should pool around the wick. It should not spill over the side. If the wax is spilling over, the wick you\u2019ve used is too small for the diameter of the candle. If there is very little wax pooling around the wick and it\u2019s not burning properly, the wick is too large for the diameter of the candle."

These will hold your wicks straight up in the middle of the jar during the pouring process and while the wax is setting. Try to balance the wick as close to the center as possible to avoid a crooked wick. If a wick is crooked and the wax sets, it won\u2019t burn straight or well. Once you put the holders in place, you won\u2019t be removing them for about 24 hours to allow the wax to fully set."

You will leave it at this setting during the entire melting process. You will need to keep the wax melted, but never boiling. Stir the wax and continue stirring almost constantly as the max melts all the way down. White wax flakes will look yellowish when melted down, so don\u2019t be alarmed when you see that."

Refer to the packaging of your product, since it may have specific instructions for ratios to achieve specific shades. Otherwise you can experiment. Pour in some of the chips, stir well and then observe the shade. If you want the color to be brighter, add a little more. Stir well. You can start by using the primary colorants (red, blue, yellow) straight, or you can mix them to create secondary colors. Achieving exact colors and shades will take a bit of practice. You can add as much color as you want \u2013 the colorant won\u2019t have a negative effect on the soy wax."

The ratio of scent is usually 1 ounce of oil for every pound of wax. Since you\u2019re working with about a pound of wax, you will need to measure out 1 ounce of your fragrance oil.

The consistency you want is close to a fruit smoothie in thickness. If you pour the wax too soon, before it\u2019s cooled down sufficiently, the center of your candle may end up sagging or cracking once it has set. Pour the wax carefully into the mason jar, stopping just under the base of the lid, leaving about 1 to 2 inches of empty space at the top. Work carefully to pour around the wick. Try not to nudge it. If you do, move it immediately back into place as best as you can."

Unless you live in a very hot climate, your candle will probably be cured slightly sooner than the full 24 hours but for best results, give the wax that much time to set. After 24 hours, remove the wick holders. Trim the wick to approximately \u00bd inch. Your mason jar candle is now ready to light."

If you don\u2019t have the wire, you can use anything you have around that will allow you to drape one piece of wicking over it, with one weighted nut hanging down on each side. Each side will be dipped at the same time, so the tapers will be made in pairs.

Carefully lower your first wick into the melted wax using your rig, dipping the two sides of the string simultaneously. Make sure your motions are smooth and continuous. Dip and then pull out without pausing. Allow several minutes of cooling. Then dip again. Repeat this several more times.
