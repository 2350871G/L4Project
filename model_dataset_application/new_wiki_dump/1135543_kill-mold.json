          "description":"Both mold and the products you\u2019ll use to clean it can irritate your eyes, throat, and respiratory system. Opening your windows will allow the air to circulate around the room so you aren\u2019t exposed to the fumes for too long. If you have vents in the room where you're cleaning, turn those on, as well. Additionally, angle a fan so it blows the fumes away from you and toward the window. If it\u2019s cold outside, you still need to open at least 1 window to allow the air to circulate in the room.Tip: It\u2019s best to wait for a dry, sunny day to treat the mold. As you clean the mold, spores will likely enter the air and may land on other areas of your home, which may be wet from the rain. Since mold grows best in moist areas, it will be harder to fully eradicate the mold when it\u2019s raining."

          "headline":"Put on a facemask, gloves, and protective eyewear.",
          "description":"Mold can cause an upper respiratory if you breathe in the spores. Similarly, fumes from the cleaning products can irritate your airways, eyes, and skin. Make sure you\u2019re wearing your protective gear during the entire time you\u2019re cleaning up the mold. It\u2019s also a good idea to wear long pants, a long-sleeved shirt, and rubber boots, if you have them. This will protect your skin while you clean."

          "headline":"Read all of the instructions for using your cleaning product.",
          "description":"Some cleaning products contain harsh ingredients, and using them incorrectly can be harmful to your health. Additionally, you could accidentally damage the surface you\u2019re cleaning. It\u2019s best to read and follow the instructions carefully. Read the precautions and warnings provided by the manufacturer."

          "description":"If mixed together, bleach and ammonia create toxic fumes that can be very hazardous to your health. It\u2019s very important that you avoid combining them. Read the labels on the products you\u2019re using so you know if they contain bleach or ammonia. In general, it\u2019s best to just avoid combining cleaning products all together."

          "headline":"Throw away absorbent or porous items that are moldy.",
          "description":"These items include things like drywall, upholstered furniture, carpet, rugs, ceiling tiles, and art, which either have holes in the surface of them or absorb liquids. Unfortunately, the mold spores can get into the pores of the material and continue to grow, even after you clean the item. Since those spores also reproduce and continue to spread the mold, it\u2019s best to get them out of your home. If an item can be laundered, then you may be able to salvage it. For instance, you may be able to wash a blanket or curtains in a washing machine.Tip: If you have an item that is very important to you and you don\u2019t want to throw it away, you may be able to hire a professional to salvage it. Things like furniture, art, and rugs may be able to be restored by someone trained in killing mold on porous materials."

          "description":"Make a bleach solution by adding 1 cup (240 mL) of bleach to 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water. Put the solution in a bucket or spray bottle. Then, apply it directly onto the mold when you\u2019re ready to use it. Be very careful when cleaning with bleach. It can irritate both your lungs and your skin. Additionally, it may stain fabrics or carpet if you splash or spill it. Don\u2019t ever combine bleach with ammonia or a cleaning product that contains ammonia."

          "description":"Get a bottle of 3% concentration hydrogen peroxide, and don\u2019t dilute it. Pour the hydrogen peroxide into a spray bottle or a bucket. Then, spray or sponge the hydrogen peroxide directly onto the mold. Hydrogen peroxide is both antibacterial and antifungal. Additionally, it cleans about as effectively as bleach, and it doesn\u2019t create harsh fumes. However, it may stain fabric or carpet, so be careful not to spill or splash it."

However, it will fade away over time. As another option, you can add your favorite essential oil to the vinegar to reduce the smell.Variation: Add baking soda to the vinegar to create a foaming mold treatment. Add equal parts baking soda and vinegar, which will create a foaming reaction. Use a sponge or stiff-bristled brush to scrub the solution onto the mold."

Then, spray the baking soda onto the mold when you\u2019re ready to use it. Baking soda is a very effective natural cleaner. Plus, it\u2019s odor absorbent, so it may help you get rid of the musty mold smell."

Stir the solution to combine the ingredients, and transfer some of the solution to a spray bottle, if you have one. Then, apply the cleaner to the wall by spraying it or sponging it over the mold. You can find borax near the laundry supplies at your local department store or online."

It\u2019s best not to rinse tea tree oil after you apply it, as it\u2019s nontoxic and will prevent the mold from coming back. Tea tree oil is antifungal and antibacterial, and it may be the most effective natural cleaner for mold. Additionally, it\u2019s not harmful to people or pets. However, it can be a bit expensive, but you don\u2019t need very much to treat mold. Make sure the tea tree oil you choose is labeled as coming from Melaleuca Alternifolia, which is the technical name for tea trees."

Don\u2019t use a product that isn't labeled as \u201cclear\u201d to clean mold. Never, ever combine ammonia with bleach or a product that contains bleach.
