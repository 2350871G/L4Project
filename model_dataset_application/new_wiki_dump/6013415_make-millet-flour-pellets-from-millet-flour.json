Millet couscous is a steamed recipe, requiring smaller pellets, but boiled porridges require larger pellets because they are less likely to disintegrate during the boiling process. The process of dampening, breaking up clumps and adding dry flour to keep the formed pellets from sticking must be repeated until all the millet flour has been converted to uniformly-sized millet-flour pellets."

This process has produced in less than one hour of steady hand-working, about 5 kg of millet flour pellets suitable for a popular West African millet porridge. These millet pellets are ready to be sent to the kitchen to boil, put in the refrigerator (up to a week) or frozen for use some other day."
