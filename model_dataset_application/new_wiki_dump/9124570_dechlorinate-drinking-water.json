There are many models and brands to choose from, and most are quite effective at minimizing chlorine levels. Additionally, you can get a water filtration attachment for your tap itself that will be just as effective as a pitcher filter. Remember to replace the filter once every few months, or as indicated by the manufacturer, to maintain proper filtration function."

These systems must be professionally purchased and installed, but they are relatively inexpensive. You can have a reverse osmosis filter professionally installed under your sink to filter all of your tap water, or you can even set it up to filter all of the water that comes into your home."

Heat is used to activate the carbon in the organic materials, which allows the filter to absorb various chemicals and compounds. GAC filters can also minimize unpleasant smells and tastes in your drinking water. A professional plumber or handyman should be able to purchase and install a GAC filter for you."

This should be enough time for all of the chlorine to evaporate out of the water. Leave the lid on the pot (but slightly off-center so some steam can escape) to prevent too much of the water itself from evaporating out. Make sure you let the water cool sufficiently before drinking it."

          "description":"Placing chlorinated water outside in the sun will cause the chlorine to evaporate out of the water as gas and make it more suitable for drinking. Simply put the water outside in a sunny location and leave it there for 24 hours. Consider covering the water with a clear plastic layer (e.g., plastic wrap) while the water is outside. Poke a few small holes in the plastic to aid evaporation. This will prevent other contaminants from getting in the water, while still allowing it to be exposed to the sunlight. This method may not be quite as effective as boiling the water. But it will remove most of the chlorine in your drinking water."

However, this method can also work to dechlorinate drinking water. Just add the vitamin C tablets to the water and allow it to sit for 24 hours. It should take about 40 mg (0.0014 oz) of vitamin C tablets to dechlorinate 1 US gal (3.8 L) of water."
