          "description":"A basic vinaigrette is a mix of acid and fat. For example, one part vinegar or lemon juice, and three to four parts olive oil. To make a fruit vinaigrette, thaw some frozen fruit and puree it in a blender. Then add the mixture to your chosen acidic liquid. For pulpier fruits or ones with seeds, you may want to strain the puree before putting it into the sauce. Try raspberries, blackberries, or strawberries for a vinaigrette that pairs well with any type of lettuce."

A fruitier sauce pairs especially well with chicken or pork. Try mixing the fruit puree with olive oil, lemon or lime juice, Dijon Mustard, and an herb like basil. Blackberries and raspberries work well for a little added sweetness."

          "description":"Place a cup of frozen fruit into a small saucepan with a little bit of orange juice or water and cornstarch. Turn up the heat until the mixture begins to bubble, then turn it down to a simmer. Stir the sauce continuously until it thickens. If using water, try adding a \u00bd cup of sugar to make it sweeter. You can also wait for the sugar water to thicken before adding fruit at the end and mixing it. Blueberries are the most common for fruit syrups. However, try blackberries, cherries, and raspberries as well."

Simmer the fruit with a little bit of ketchup, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, and cumin. Once it starts to boil, reduce the heat and stir until it reaches a thicker, typical barbecue sauce texture. Try using frozen pineapple, mango, or a mix of berries."
