Use bamboo poles, tall stakes or fence posts to create a framework around your plants. Drape your netting over the stakes and anchor it to the ground using bent wire. Try to drape your netting so it forms a V-shaped tent. This will prevent birds from accessing and pulling on the plants."

          "description":"Cut the bottom off a clean, clear soda bottle. Position the bottle so it rests over the seedling, then remove the soda cap. This method allows sunlight to reach your seedling, while still keeping the plant out of reach of roaming birds. This method can also be done using upside-down berry baskets. As your seedlings grow, you may have to prop up your bottles or baskets using bricks or rocks."

Plant stakes, fence posts or bamboo poles around your garden and weave fishing line between the posts, above the plants. If you don\u2019t have fishing line, thread or wire will also work."

You can also add methyl anthranilate to your plants and seedlings to keep away the birds. This will deter not only birds, but other animals as well. These chemicals will not affect the taste of the food you are growing or cause any ill effects to humans, but they will serve as a strong deterrent to birds."

To create your scarecrow, tie two sticks together with string to create a cross. Dress your scarecrow in old clothes and stuff him with hay or straw to give him a shape. You can create a face for your scarecrow by drawing on an old burlap bag and attaching the bag to the stick using your string. Mount your scarecrow in your garden to keep the birds away. If you don\u2019t want to build a scarecrow, scary masks or owl silhouettes also work. The goal is to frighten the birds, so be creative.
