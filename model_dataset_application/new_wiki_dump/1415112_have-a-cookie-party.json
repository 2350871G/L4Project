          "description":"What is the theme of your party to be? Sure, it's cookies but what exactly about cookies? There are lots of fun possibilities here, including:\n\nA cookie exchange party: At this party, all guests are invited to bring 1 to 2 dozen of their favorite cookies to share. These can be homemade, purchased or ordered from a local bakery. A cookie decorating party: At this party, all the guests get a chance to improve on plain cookies by making them decorative and adding tasty things like sprinkles and edible glitter. You can even involve the guests in baking cookies from scratch and have them choose what shapes to cut the cookies. A Cookie Monster party: Guests all have to come dressed as a cookie monster and bring a giant cookie with them to share. Or, you could simply have guests turn up to a party at which everything is themed on the Cookie Monster, such as Cookie Monster posters and images, large cookies and a cookie cake. Games could include chasing monsters and finding hidden Cookie Monsters inside things. Cookies of a particular style or theme: Maybe you like animal crackers and all things animal? Maybe you like chocolate cookies and all things chocolate? Or perhaps you like only cookies from Germany or Sweden? There is nothing to stop you from having just one type of cookie in many variations. Around-the-world cookies: Ask guests individually to make a cookie that comes from a pre-chosen country. Also ask the guest to be prepared to talk a little about the cookie, where it comes from and what meaning it has in that country. You could either have guests bring these cookies along (suggest a recipe or let them find their own online) or you might bake the cookies at the party itself. None of the above; just lots of cookies: Tell your guests that when you mean cookies, that's all that there will be to eat, along with drinks. You could find games that feature cookies, or change standard party to games to include cookies, and award cookies as prizes. Cookie costumes are a must."

Place chairs around the table, with plenty of space for excited elbow movements. Choose decorating goodies. The most basic requirement is frosting in pots with spreaders (use a variety of colors for the frosting). Then you'll need edible decorations such as: sprinkles, chocolate chips, edible glitter, candies, nuts (if nobody has nut allergies), cracked toffee pieces, etc. Place these in containers around the table. Make it easy for everyone to grab and share things. Consider whether you'll also include the kids in making the cookies from scratch. You could make the dough in advance and set up a rolling and cookie cutter station near the oven and have a teenager or adult supervise all baking once the cookies are cut. Put out plenty of different cookie cutter shapes, and have baking sheets already prepared for adding cookies to. The supervisor needs to keep an eye on timing of each batch of cookies, as burnt cookies result in tears. Allow all creations to be eaten by the makers.
