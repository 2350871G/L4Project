(This is not the case for carbon monoxide alarms, about which, see #2, below.) Smoke fills up a room from the ceiling down, so having the detectors high should alert you early on. It is also recommended that detectors be placed at least 10 centimeter (3.9 in) / 4\" from the wall when installed on the ceiling, and 10 centimeter (3.9 in) / 4\" from the ceiling for wall installation."

Unless, of course, you want everyone to notice your lack of culinary skills! Also keep detectors one meter / 3.3 feet (1.0 m) from the doorways of steam emitting areas, such as the bathroom, laundry or kitchen."
