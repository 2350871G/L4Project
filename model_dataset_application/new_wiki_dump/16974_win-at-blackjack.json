          "description":"The game itself is simple enough to figure out. Every player knows they need to get to 21 to beat the dealer. However, many players don\u2019t understand the terms used beyond hitting to get another card or staying to end their term. Before you play, know about asking to double down, split your hand, or surrender your hand so you can incorporate these into your betting strategies and give yourself the best chance of winning. When you choose to double down, you double your bet and receive only one more card. When you have two of the same card, such as a pair of twos, you can split them and play them as two hands with two separate bets. Very few casinos allow you to surrender your hand. When you have a bad hand, you can surrender and save half your bet."

Also, once you go over 21, or bust, you lose even if the dealer busts as well. Once you understand this, you\u2019ll realize that winning  depends upon reacting to the cards you have as well as those other players and the dealer show on the table in order to predict what card the dealer has face-down."

          "description":"Because blackjack is a game of probabilities compared to other casino games, you will be a stronger player by learning how to play certain hands. For example, do you hit on your 16 when the dealer has a ten? Do you split your eights? Study a chart to determine which choice you should make depending on what cards you have and what card the dealer shows. At first you\u2019ll find it hard to remember how to act during various in-game scenarios, but the more you play, the more you\u2019ll learn how to play your hand by instinct."

          "description":"Different casinos or blackjack games feature different rules. Many games use multiple decks of cards in order to discourage card counting, throwing off your ability to track your odds of winning. Most games of blackjack require the dealer to stop at 17, even if this means the dealer loses, but the rules may allow for the dealer to hit on a soft 17, which is a 17 made with an ace (the ace can be a one or an 11). A game that makes it harder for you to win in the long term, such as one that allows the dealer to hit on a soft 17, should be avoided. Avoid continuous shuffle machines when playing in person. These machines make keeping track of possible cards you and the dealer can draw an impossibility."

          "description":"Before you start playing at a table, it\u2019s important to find out how you will be paid for a blackjack. If you get a natural blackjack, a 21 on the first two cards dealt to you, a table may pay you 3:2, which is $3 for every $2 wagered. Others will pay you less, such as 6:5, and should be avoided. 6:5 odds are worse for you than 3:2. Consider that if you bet and win twice on the first odds, you\u2019ll bet ten units to win 12 units. 12 units on the second odds makes for four bets totalling eight units bet to win 12 units."

Remember that there is no such thing as being due for a win or hot and cold decks. Any such pattern you perceive will disappear over time because the game is based on chance and probability. Instead, try betting low after a loss or deck shuffle and increase your bet a little when you perceive the odds are in your favor."

The more you play, the more you\u2019ll gain a sense of how many helpful cards remain in the deck and how to proceed with the hand you have. Once you have a grasp of your odds of winning, you can more aggressively bet on good hands."

If the dealer does have blackjack, you will win your side bet but lose your original bet. This may get you back some money in the short-term, but long-term the bet makes the casino money. Beginner players have no way of knowing if the dealer has a card worth ten points face-down under an ace. Card counters however have a better idea and can use their information to make money on this bet."

The ten card, face cards, and the aces are worth negative one point each. The idea is that you\u2019ll keep a total value of all the cards on display, and as more face cards are left in the deck you\u2019ll make more blackjacks while the dealer busts more.

The true count takes the running count and divides it by the number of decks in play. This count gives you more of an idea of how much of an advantage you have in betting. A running count of three is fine in a one-deck game, but this number means less when there are multiple decks since there are more cards to factor that reduce your chances of winning. For example, a seven running count divided by two decks leaves you with a true count of about three. But if there are six decks in play, the true count is only about one."
