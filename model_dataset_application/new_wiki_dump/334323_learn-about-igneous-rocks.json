When the magma moves to a cooler part of the earth, it loses its heat and crystallizes into an igneous rock. Magma is thick and is composed of very hot elements and compounds. Magma can cool both inside the earth and out onto the surface of the earth."

          "description":"This is formed when magma cools beneath the surface of the earth. The magma is insulated by the surrounding rock, and cools slowly. This allows the rock to form large crystals. Another name for intrusive rock is plutonic rock. You can often see the crystals of intrusive rocks with your naked eye. Examples of intrusive rock include  diorite, gabbro, granite, pegmatite, and peridotite."

          "description":"When magma erupts onto the earth's surface, it becomes lava in a volcanic eruption. Lava cools and turns to rock relatively quickly. The crystals in the rock don't have much time to form, creating fine-grained rocks with small crystals. You can hardly see the crystals at all with the naked eye. You will need a microscope or a hand lens to see the crystals. Another name for extrusive rock is volcanic rock. Examples of extrusive rock include andesite, basalt, obsidian, pumice, rhyolite, scoria, and tuff. Some extrusive rocks cool very quickly and do not form crystals at all. These rocks are considered volcanic glass. Obsidian and pumice are examples of volcanic glass."

The minerals are broken into small pieces in this type of rock by the explosive eruption. Examples of pyroclastic rock include serpentinite, diabase, spilite, greisen and skarn."
