If you are putting fish in your sushi, then you can use the same knife to slice the fish and the roll. Only very sharp knives can cut sushi rolls efficiently. Using a knife that isn\u2019t sharp means that you will need to use a sawing motion to cut through the roll, which will damage and crush the ingredients."

Sushi roll cutters can be small and gadget sized, which are ideal if you make small quantities of sushi. These devices are also available in larger catering sizes, which can slice multiple rolls at one time.
