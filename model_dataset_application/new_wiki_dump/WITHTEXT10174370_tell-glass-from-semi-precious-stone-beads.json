Stones with names like Oriental emerald, American ruby, or Australian jade could be a green sapphire, a garnet, or treated quartz respectively. If they\u2019re real, they\u2019ll just be called emeralds, rubies, or jade."

If you don\u2019t see any inclusions or blemishes in the stone using a jeweler\u2019s loupe (a special magnifying lens), it\u2019s a good indication that the stone is glass or synthetic. You should also look for scratches on the gemstone. Most gemstones are hard and durable, so scratches or other signs of external damage indicate that the stone isn\u2019t real. Jeweler\u2019s loupes come with either a single lens or with 3 lenses. A single lens loupe is generally cheaper but of lower quality. Most professional jewelers use a loupe with a 10x magnification. Keep the focal length (distance between the loupe and gem) in mind. A longer focal length means a weaker magnification, and vice versa."

You should focus in particular on the hue (color), tone (how dark or light the color is), and saturation (the intensity of the color). The hue will help you identify the general type of stone, while the tone and saturation will help you pinpoint the specific variation of that stone you possess.A high value emerald, for example, will be blueish green or pure green, with a light tone and vivid saturation (it should be almost transparent). Using a light source like a desk lamp can make your inspection of the stone easier."

To test amber, see if it floats in water. Real amber will float, fakes will sink. To test jet, rub it with sandpaper. If it is fake, it will produce brown dust. If it\u2019s real, it won\u2019t produce any dust.You can also test jet by inserting a hot needle into the stone. A fake stone will bubble and produce an acrid smell, a real stone won\u2019t be affected. To test if jade is fake, hold it up to a light source to search for inclusions. Fake jade will be flawless.You can also lightly strike the jade with glass or metal. If it\u2019s real, the jade will make a tinkling sound."
