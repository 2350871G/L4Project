The major disadvantage of this approach is that you\u2019ll have to improvise a lot.

Dungeon masters often unintentionally railroad their players when they really want them to go somewhere. Avoid doing this as often as possible, even if you really want the players to experience something. You can always move an encounter at the last minute! Player choice is essential to creating a fun world. Don\u2019t start your players off in the bottom of a pit with no way to get out.

For example, if religion is really important in your world, you\u2019ll need a detailed list of deities. You\u2019ll need to put temples in your towns, and clerics have to pray to specific gods.
