  "text":" Preparing the Salad Wash and slice the lettuce and cucumber, and add them to the salad bowl. The lettuce should be sliced about 1/2\" wide, and the cucumbers should be quartered lengthwise and then sliced. The salad bowl should be medium-large sized. If you have any extra long slices of lettuce, cut those into thirds. Add the mozzarella cheese to the salad bowl, and toss until everything's combined. Set aside. Peel the hardboiled eggs and dice them. You can dice them any size you like. For a formal look, dice the eggs into little 1/3\" squares. Add the diced eggs to a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Toss them to mix, and then add to the bowl. Preparing the Steak Place the steaks on the cutting board and begin slicing them widthwise (not lengthwise) into 1/8\" slices. Slice all the steaks and place them in a pile. You'll probably want to use a serrated knife for this. Add 2\u20133 tablespoons of olive oil to the frying pan and heat on medium-high. Wait until the oil is thoroughly hot before you add the meat. Cook the steak slices. You'll want to stir them occasionally, cooking them until there's just a bit of redness. Carefully place the sliced steak into the pan and spread it out using the metal spatula. You want as much meat as possible to have surface contact with the pan. Season the meat with salt and pepper and cook until almost done, stirring occasionally. The meat should all be cooked within 6 minutes. You may need to add a bit more olive oil to the pan if it begins to get dry. During the minute of cooking, turn the heat to high and let the meat simmer rapidly in its juices. Once the minute is up, turn off the stove and remove the meat from the heat. Let the meat sit for 6 minutes before serving. This will allow it to soak up any juices and make the meat really juicy when you serve it. Serving the Steak Salad Decide whether you'll add the steak into the salad, or dish out the steak separately. If you're adding it into the salad, add it into the salad and re-toss to combine everything. If you don't want to add it into a salad, place the steak onto a serving plate. With this choice, each person will serve himself. Serve the salad with cottage cheese, ranch dressing, and lots of sunflower kernels! This will taste amazing. Enjoy.",
