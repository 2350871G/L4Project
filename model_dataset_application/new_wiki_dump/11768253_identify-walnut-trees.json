          "description":"Walnuts don't grow in brown husks like we're used to seeing in stores. The brown husk is actually inside a larger muted lime-colored casing about the size of a small tennis ball. You'll typically see 2 or 3 green rounds growing near where the leaf-bearing twigs shoot off from thinner branches. Keep in mind that black walnut trees don't grow walnuts until they're 4 to 7 years old. Butternuts take 2 to 3 years and English walnuts can take anywhere from 4 to 10 years. The most bountiful harvests usually occur after the tree (any variety) is 10 years old. The walnuts of English and black walnut trees are round while butternuts have oblong, papaya-shaped casings. You may need to use binoculars since walnut trees can grow to be 50 to 100 feet (15 to 30 meters) tall and grow plumage high on their trunks."

          "description":"The deep-gray bark of black walnut and English walnut trees has rounded ridges and deep crevices running vertically up and down the trunk. The bark of butternut trees is light gray and relatively smooth to the touch. If you remove a little of the gray outer bark from the trunk of a black walnut or English walnut tree, you'll see a rich chocolate brown color underneath. The bark of black walnut trees can vary from dark brown to gray while butternuts have white-gray colored bark. This is a good way to identify walnut trees in the winter when they're not producing walnuts and their leaves have dropped."

          "description":"Black walnuts are allelopathic, which means they release chemicals into the ground that can poison plants up to 50 or 60 feet away. If the tree is standing along without any neighboring trees or brush, there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019s a walnut tree. Butternut and English walnut trees also release toxins but in much smaller quantities so that other nearby trees and shrubs can survive. However, there are some trees that can tolerate the black walnut's toxicity (note that this isn't an exhaustive list): Japanese maple, red maple, yellow birch, redbud, sycamore, oak (all varieties), black cherry, willow, and elm."

You may also notice small mounds of freshly piled dirt where gray squirrels may have buried the nuts. Note that you're less like to find cracked shell casings in the winter when the tree is dormant."

Walnuts from the butternut tree taste just like they sound\u2014buttery! The shell of English walnuts is thinner and much easier to crack open than the other 2 varieties. The walnuts you're most likely to find in stores are typically from English walnut trees. Walnuts from black walnut trees are so strong they're typically used to make flavorings and extracts. Be mindful breaking open the casings from a black walnut tree because the shell can stain your hands and clothing.Warning: Only taste something if you're already relatively sure that you're dealing with a walnut tree. Otherwise, you might ingest something potentially harmful."
