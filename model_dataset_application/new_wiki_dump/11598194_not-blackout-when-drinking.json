Avoid binges by limiting your intake to no more than 1 drink per day if you\u2019re a woman or 2 drinks if you\u2019re a man. 1 drink is defined as 12 fluid ounces (350 mL) of beer (5% alcohol), 5 fluid ounces (150 mL) of wine (12% alcohol), or 1.5 fluid ounces (44 mL) of 80 proof distilled spirits (40% alcohol). Binge drinking is technically defined as any level of drinking that causes you to reach a BAC of 0.08% or higher. For most people, this happens after having 4-5 drinks within a 2-hour period.
