          "description":"Java moss cannot survive for long in marine aquariums, so make sure you have a freshwater tank ready. Tanks any smaller than 5 US gal (19 L) could crowd your fish as your moss starts to grow. Java moss can survive slightly brackish water with a low salt content but prefers freshwater. Tap water should work fine, but you may need to add chemicals from an aquarium store to make it safe for plants and fish."

Java moss can tolerate temperatures up to 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C), but it will cause it to grow much slower than the lower temperatures. Check the temperature of your tank often to make sure it does not fluctuate. Many pet stores or aquarium shops will carry floating thermometers so you can easily check."

          "description":"Use a home pH test to check the acidity of your fish tank. If you find that the pH is off, you can add store-bought chemicals to raise or lower it to the desired level. Follow the instructions carefully when adding any chemicals to the tank. Test kits or strips can be purchased at aquarium specialty stores or online. Adding shells or new rocks to your tank can help raise your pH if it is too low. Wood and moss will lower a high pH level. You should test the pH of the water once per week, especially when you perform a water change."

          "description":"Not only will it help keep your water clean, but a filter will create a current in your tank. Water circulation helps spread nutrients throughout the tank, making it easier for your moss to grow quickly. A weaker current works best as the moss\u2019s roots are establishing. A strong current could break apart moss and clog the filter. Keep the moss out of direct flow from the filter."

If you want your moss dense and to grow quickly, use bright lights. For thinner moss with a darker color, use low lights. In a pinch, a desk lamp secured above your tank will work for a short amount of time. Brighter lights will cause more algae to form in your tank."
