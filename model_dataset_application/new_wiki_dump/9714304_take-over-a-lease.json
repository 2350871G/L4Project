          "description":"When you take over a car lease, the car company will check your credit. You typically need to have a pretty good credit score to qualify for a lease. Car companies usually have the same qualification requirements for lease takeovers as they do for new leases. In the United States, go to https://www.annualcreditreport.com/ to get the free credit report you are entitled to by law. You can also use online services, such as Credit Karma, to check your credit score. Many credit card companies also have credit checking and monitoring services you can use for free if you are a cardholder."

          "description":"There are a number of lease transfer companies online that make it easier to find and take over a lease. Swapalease.com and LeaseTrader.com are two of the largest. Lease transfer sites allow people who want to get out of their lease to place a listing with their car, their location, and the terms of their lease. You can search these listings to find the car and lease options that are right for you. Research the lease transfer company carefully before you use it to make sure it's legit. Look for reviews from others who've successfully transferred leases using the site."

          "description":"You may not have to pay as much to assume an existing car lease as you would if you started a new lease on your own. However, most car companies have transfer and application fees. Negotiate to determine whether you or the original lessee will pay these fees. Any agreement should be put in writing. For example, if there is an application fee, the car company typically would look to you to pay that. If you and the original lessee have agreed that you would each pay half, the car company isn't going to enforce that agreement for you."

You may be able to complete this application online. You also may need to fill out a paper application and mail it in, or visit a local dealership to complete the application process. The car company will check your credit and make sure you qualify to take over the lease."

Some lessees may be wanting to get out of their car lease because there is damage to the car that they don't want to pay for when they turn the car back in. The only way to know for sure is to get the car inspected. If you're completing the lease transfer process at a dealership, they may offer to do an inspection for you. Make note of any damages or repairs that need to be made. If these are significant, you may want to negotiate with the original lessee to take care of those repairs before the lease is transferred into your name."

Depending on your income and the results of your credit check, your lease terms may differ from those of the original lessee. Read the transfer agreement carefully and make sure you know what your payments will be, and what your responsibilities are at the end of the lease term."

If they assign their lease to you, on the other hand, you take over the remainder of their lease term on the same conditions and rent directly from the landlord.

While you may want to meet with the landlord in person, get any agreement in writing. The landlord may later change their mind, or forget that they agreed to let you take over the lease. The landlord may want to run a credit or background check on you before they consent. Typically landlords will want you to meet the same requirements as any other new tenant."

You also need to figure out how you're going to deal with utilities and other services, such as cable or internet. For example, if the original renter is assigning their lease to you, they may have already paid a security deposit. The landlord may want an additional deposit from you, or the original renter may want you to pay them a portion of the deposit since they won't be living there anymore. Another issue is lease renewal. Landlords typically offer better rental rates for tenants who renew their leases.
