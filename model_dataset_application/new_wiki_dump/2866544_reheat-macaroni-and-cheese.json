The secret to maintaining or reviving the original texture is to add a bit of milk when you reheat it. The amount needed will depend on your macaroni and cheese. Start by stirring in 1 tablespoon of milk per cup of macaroni and cheese. The milk will not fully incorporate until the macaroni is heated, so don't worry if it looks a bit wet at first. You may also substitute half and half or cream for a richer texture and flavor."

If you do not feel comfortable using plastic wrap in the microwave, you can also put an inverted plate over the dish, but be sure to use an oven mitt when removing it, as the plate can become hot. It will also release hot steam that can burn you."

Then continue to heat it in 30-60 second intervals until it reaches the desired temperature. If your microwave does not have a turning carousel, heat your macaroni and cheese in 45 second intervals, and turn the bowl in between."

A double boiler consists of a saucepan that stacks on top of another pan filled with water.

If you do not have a double boiler, it is easy to make one. Find a metal or glass (preferably pyrex) mixing bowl that fits on top of your favorite saucepan. Add water to the pan, but not so much that it touches the bottom of the bowl. Add your food to the bowl, and place the pan with the bowl on top on the burner over medium heat.
