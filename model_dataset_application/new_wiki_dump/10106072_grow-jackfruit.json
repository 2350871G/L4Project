          "description":"Before you buy jackfruit seeds, think about whether you have the room in your garden for the world\u2019s largest fruit. Jackfruit trees can grow up to 100 feet (30m) tall and thrive in humid, low-lying areas. While the jackfruit tree has adapted to a range of climates, young trees will likely be killed in temperatures below 32 \u00b0F (0 \u00b0C). Jackfruit trees are not viable at 4000 feet above sea level or higher, and they do not survive well in areas of high or sustained wind. The jackfruit tree is too large to make a suitable container plant, so must be planted outdoors."

It is possible to harvest jackfruit seeds from a fully ripe jackfruit. If your local grocery or fruit market sells jackfruit, you can remove the seeds from the pulp and then rinse the seeds in warm water to remove any stickiness. If you purchase jackfruit seeds online, try to buy them from a reputable organic gardening vendor \u2013 jackfruit seeds are only viable for around 4 weeks, so you need to be careful who and where you buy them from.
