          "description":"Farms often attract starlings, but the birds can eat your livestock feed and spread disease to your animals. Using feed and feeding methods that do not attract starlings can help keep the birds off of your farm. Provide either granular feed or large pellets (at least 0.5 inch in size) that are more difficult for starlings to eat. Do not put animal feed directly on the ground. Use bird-proof feeders. Many of these will make \u201cclanging\u201d noises periodically or have covers that birds cannot penetrate. Feed animals in a covered area, such as a barn. Feed animals in the evening or after dark."

Place wide netting or a cage around feeders. Smaller songbirds will be able to penetrate the holes, but starlings will not. Cut perches very short so that only smaller birds can perch on your feeders. Try a feeder that requires birds to feed upside down: starlings do not like to eat upside down. Do not put birdseed directly on the ground."
