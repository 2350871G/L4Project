Similarly, a small piece of a crunchy vegetable adds variety and interest to a soft dish. Two-ingredient garnishes can be laid out in alternating layers on a plate, creating a contrast between two colors. Try slices of tomatoes and cucumbers, or two different colors of gelatin cubes."

Most garnishes show up well on white tableware, but bright-colored garnishes may work well on a dark ceramic dish as well.

Citrus fruits, such as lemons and limes, are excellent for adding color and flavor to dishes containing fish and lightly flavored meat, as well as other fruits and desserts.

Only some flowers are edible, and even those should be used sparingly to avoid causing digestive issues. All that said, a flower blossom is simultaneously one of the easiest and most attractive garnishes available. The taste of a flower can change with variety, time of year, and the environment it was planted in. Taste a petal before you use it as garnish, even if you've eaten that species of flower before."

You can also use rosemary leaves, mint, or other herbs, but remember to remove inedible stems first. Sometimes, a sprinkle of ground herbs or spices is all a dish needs.

  "text":" Selecting a Garnish Use edible garnishes whenever possible. Garnishes are not only for decoration; they can add new flavors and textures to the meal as well. Using edible garnish also avoids the hassle of having to remove the garnish before eating. Make all inedible garnishes easily identifiable and removable.
