  "text":" Preparation Select suitable flowers. The flowers should be in full bloom, in good condition and without flaws. Choose a desiccant method for drying the flowers. Suitable desiccants include silica gel, sand or borax. Silica gel is probably the simplest, so it's the method used here. Purchase silica gel from the store or online. Grind the gel down before using (place in a plastic bag and roll over with a rolling pin). Clean everything thoroughly afterward. If you don't want to grind down the gel, mix it with 1 part fine sand to parts of silica gel. Choose a box for holding the flowers while they dry. A shoebox or similar box will work well. Poke holes across the base of the box. Line the box with tissue paper or newspaper. Make sure that the paper goes up the sides of the box too, as you'll be pulling it out later, while the flowers and gel are still on top of it. Fill the box with a layer of the desiccant to about 1/2 an inch/1.5 centimeter (0.6 in). Drying the Flowers Lay the chosen flowers onto the silica gel. Check that the flowers are completely dry before adding them; the less moisture, the better. Cover gently with more silica gel. Place the lid on the box (or cover firmly with brown paper and tie it down). Let sit in a dry, cool place for 5 to 10 days. Check to see how the flowers have dried. If the silica gel has changed color from bright blue to pink, this is a sign it has absorbed moisture from the flowers. If the flowers are papery, they're dry. Gently slide the paper out from under the flowers, pulling it up the side of the box. Let the silica gel fall through the holes into a container for disposal. Make the holes bigger if needed. Remove the dried Christmas roses. When most of the silica gel is out of the box, pick up the roses. They can now be used for craft, floral arrangement or whatever else you have in mind.",
