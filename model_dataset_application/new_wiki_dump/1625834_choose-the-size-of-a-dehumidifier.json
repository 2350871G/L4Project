If you don't already know how big the space is, use a measuring tape to measure the length and width of the floor.

In most buildings, the ideal relative humidity level (RHL) to keep the space comfortable and prevent bacteria and mold growth is around 30-50%. Most dehumidifiers have a built in humidistat that allows you to set the unit to the optimum humidity level. For example, if you're working with a room that is 12 feet (3.7 m) by 10 feet (3.0 m), then the area is 120 square feet (11 m)."

          "description":"If you need to dehumidify an entire house, it might be worthwhile to invest in a whole-house dehumidifier. You can get a unit designed to attach to a pre-existing central heating or air system, or opt for one that can be installed by itself. Whole-house dehumidifiers are designed to work in spaces as large as 3,000 square feet (280 m). While these units are expensive to buy initially, they can save you money and energy in the long run by helping your air conditioner work more efficiently."

While desiccant humidifiers tend to have lower capacity ratings than refrigerant models, they operate much more efficiently in lower temperatures. In general, it's best to use a desiccant dehumidifier if the temperature in your space will fall below 65 \u00b0F (18 \u00b0C).

If the temperature drops below 65 \u00b0F (18 \u00b0C) in the space where you are running your refrigerant dehumidifier, ice may form on the evaporator coils and prevent the unit from functioning properly."
