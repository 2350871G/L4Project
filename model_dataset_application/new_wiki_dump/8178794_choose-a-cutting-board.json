However, glass cutting boards have been shown to dull brand new kitchen knives in as little as 10 strokes. If you happen to have a glass cutting board, use it as a serving platter or cheese tray instead. Other hard cutting board materials\u2014like marble, granite, ceramic, and composite\u2014can do similar damage to your knives, and should be avoided."

Avoid slick or smooth plastic, as this can cause knives to slip. Acrylic plastic boards can do almost as much damage to your knives as glass.

Wood cutting boards are lovely, they last a long time, and they are great for your knives. Wood cutting boards are available in many types of wood, including oak, maple, and teak. Teak is a great option because it absorbs very little liquid, so it will take longer for the board to wear out. A good choice is the Proteak Edge Grain Teak Cutting Board for $92.59 (available on Amazon)."

Additionally, bamboo boards are a sustainable, environmentally friendly choice, since bamboo is a fast-growing, highly renewable resource. Bamboo boards are lighter in weight than wood boards. Bamboo boards don\u2019t need to be oiled as often as wood boards. A good choice is the Totally Bamboo 20-7930 3-Piece Cutting Board Set for $15 (on Amazon)."
