If you are just starting out, you may want to acquire tools slowly, as you need them. You'll spread out the expense and keep the clutter under control if you do."

    {
      "headline":"Buy a good computer program or guidebook on basic home repair.",
      "description":"The scope of the material should depend on your willingness to tackle various jobs and the kinds of jobs you wish to perform first. Start with a general guide. Then, as you need them, look up or purchase guides covering appliances, door hardware, plumbing, electrical, air conditioning, flooring, painting, exterior trim, roofing, and other specific topics. Try your local library, especially for projects that you may only have to address once or twice in the course of your home repairs."

      "description":"You can attend a two to four hour class and learn the basics for installing various products, such as ceramic tile or light fixtures. These classes are usually taught on basic levels, and give detailed lists of supplies and tools required for each one. Your local trade school, community college, or adult education program may also have home repair classes. Look around and see what you find."

If you are helpful and pass a tool to them, or hold something while they work on it, they may be inclined to share a little of their knowledge and tips with you. Take care not to get in their way; you may run up the bill if they are paid by the hour."

      "description":"A great price on a ladder or saw is no bargain if the tool fails, and can even be dangerous. Great close-out stores are everywhere, and often they offer professional grade tools at a fraction of their usual price, but make sure what you're getting is suitable. Are you buying a tool or part that needs to perform well and last a long time? If so, consider it an investment and be willing to pay for quality up front. Remember that you can also save money by using something for a long time, installing it correctly for yourself, and by not buying things you don't really need. Price does not always mean quality. A $20 faucet may serve perfectly well if you don't mind a basic appearance. A $300 faucet probably includes a markup for a brand name and designer styling. Product reviews and ratings can help you determine what's worth paying extra."

Remembering the mistakes you make the first time will help avoid them in the future, and knowing where you purchased an item, and when, may help you with warranty issues or finding parts for future repairs. Keep a file folder just for warranties and product manuals. Take digital photos. While you have the wall cut open or the trench dug, take photos of your project. They will help you remember later how things went together, where pipes, wires, or other hidden items went, and so on. Keep a notebook where you record your home repairs, and date your entries."

Routine maintenance can include lubricating door locks and hinges, cleaning drain lines in the bathroom and kitchen sink, vacuuming the refrigerator coils and air conditioning coils, fixing plumbing leaks as soon as you find them, and watching for loose or broken shingles. Broken shingles are a good example of preventive maintenance. They can be repaired or replaced easily and simply, but once water gets under them, roof decking can begin to rot, attic insulation becomes wet and moldy, and ceilings can be stained or damaged."

Simple maintenance, which the average homeowner can learn to do, will prevent the need to do major, and expensive, home repairs later."

If you can store it conveniently, it will last for years and possibly save you a trip to the hardware store if you have another plumbing problem later.
