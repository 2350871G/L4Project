This does not work in the Gameboy Advance version of the game, so you'll need to dodge his jumps instead. Bowser jumps in a steady rhythm, so it's not too hard to time it correctly. The moment after he starts an upward jump is a good time to run under him. Keep running after you're through, as Bowser changes direction quickly. Avoid the propeller of the clown car, which can damage you."

This time, Bowser will keep stomping on the ground while the mechakoopas are around. This is the toughest part of the fight, so it may take a few attempts. Bowser will destroy stunned mechakoopas if he bounces too near them. If you can, grab a mechakoopa when you're at the opposite side of the screen from browser."

Press forward on the D-pad to make Mario dive and pick up speed, then press back to use this speed to ascend higher again.
