  "text":" Part 1: Doing Annual Pruning Prune Drift roses in late winter or early spring just before they begin to grow again. Pruning during this time, while they are still dormant, is less stressful for the rose. In Zones 9 and 10, where roses stay evergreen, they should be pruned in January. Wear a pair of good gardening gloves with reinforced palms and long sleeves. This will protect you from getting pricked by any rose thorns. Use sharp hand pruners that have a scissor action. Dull pruners and anvil-type pruners will crush the rose stems. Disinfect the pruners before using them. Do this by soaking them for 5 minutes in a household disinfectant like Lysol. Make sure you rinse the disinfectant off with water and dry the pruners with a clean towel before using them. Prune the whole Drift rose down to a height of 6 inches. Cut each stem \u00bc inch above an outward-facing growth bud, which is usually found where a leaf with five leaflets is growing from the stem. Growth buds look like tiny, triangular-shaped, slightly raised patches on the stems. New stems grow from these growth buds. Make the cut on a 45-degree angle. Cutting at a steeper angle will damage the growth bud. Prune any dead, brittle stems off completely. Do this by making the cut at the base of the dead stem.

This will allow the Drift rose to grow fresh, new foliage for the coming year and reduce the possibility for diseases that can survive the winter on the leaves. Part 2: Doing Spring to Fall Pruning Prune off any dead and diseased branches as soon as you notice them. Do this throughout the growing season. Prune back any stems with cankers or small dark brown patches of tissue. This will prevent diseases like black spot and mildew, which are rare in Drift roses, from developing. Make the pruning cut into the healthy part of the stem about 1 inch beyond the diseased area. The pith or center of the stem should be white and full-looking, not brown or tan. Always disinfect the pruners between cuts when pruning a rose with any type of disease. This will lessen the risk of spreading the disease on healthy stems. Deadhead Drift roses to encourage the growth of new flowers more quickly. However, these roses do not need to be deadheaded to grow properly. When deadheading, make the cut at a 45-degree angle \u00bc inch above the first leaf with five leaflets. The first few leaves below the flower will have only one to three leaflets.

Do not worry about sucker shoots on the rootstock below the graft. Drift roses grow on their own roots, rather than being grafted onto rootstock like many hybrid roses. Part 3: Cleaning Up After You Prune Make sure you rake up any flowers, leaves, and stems from pruning and throw them away. When left on the ground around a Drift rose, these cuttings can harbor insects as well as fungi and bacteria that could be splashed onto the rose. Do not add any scrap cuttings to the compost pile. Doing this can lead to the development of disease and insect infestations. Freshen up the mulch after you clean up the scraps from pruning. However, avoid piling the mulch too deep. Use a shovel or garden fork to loosen and turn the old mulch. This keeps it from becoming compacted, which restricts air flow and moisture penetration. Rake the old mulch smooth with a dirt rake.
