          "headline":"Vacuum the flies.",
          "description":"Use a small hand vacuum, or hold the furniture-cleaning nozzle of a standard vacuum cleaner. Walk around your infested plants and suck the pests from the undersides of the leaves and foliage. This method is quick and straightforward, and it can remove whiteflies from all stages of the development cycle \u2013 from larvae to mature, plant-munching adults. Vacuuming is most effective as soon as you notice an infestation. When the vacuum bag is full of whiteflies, trade it out. Seal the vacuum bag inside an airtight plastic bag, then put it into the freezer for at least 24 hours to kill off the insects. Once all of the flies are dead, you can empty the bag into the trash."

          "headline":"Remove the severely diseased leaves and branches.",
          "description":"Use garden clippers to trim away as much as you can without killing the plant. You can also pluck infested leaves by hand. Look for white eggs and wingless \"crawlers\" on the underside of the leaves. Extremely infested leaves may be coated with a sticky or waxy fluid\u2014honeydew\u2014that is produced when the feeding nymphs ingest plant juices. Leaves may also appear pale and wilted. Only trim as much as is healthy for the plant. If a particularly delicate plant is infested, you should cut away only the most infected leaves. If the plant is hardy, consider paring all the way down to the stem in order to stop the infestation in its tracks. Make sure to properly dispose of the diseased leaves. Burn them or seal them into an airtight bag. If you don't handle the leaves carefully, the whitefly infestation may spread again."

          "headline":"Prepare for repeated applications.",
          "description":"The whitefly matures in 4 stages: from eggs, to nymphs, to pupa, to the adult fly. Each method typically only targets certain stages in the fly life cycle. Thus, if a method targets the adult fly, you will need to keep applying that treatment until all of the existing eggs have matured into adults. You will need to be quick and diligent in your treatments to make sure that the newly-formed adults do not lay new eggs. The nymph and adult flies are the only stages that cause physical damage to the host plant. Younger whiteflies will, however, mature into more damaging forms if left unchecked. For the best application timeframe, check the lifespan and stages of your particularly whitefly. Various species\u2014including the Silverleaf, Fig, Greenhouse, and Bandedwing whitefly\u2014each have a different lifespan."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Wash your plants with a soap solution.",
          "description":"Put one good squirt of dish soap into 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water and mix well. Pay special attention to the undersides of the leaves, where most of the whiteflies live. Be aware that this method only kills the adult insect. Wash every 3 or 4 days to eliminate the new whiteflies as they emerge from pupa. Depending on the type of whitefly, you may need to continue this treatment for several weeks until the infestation is gone. If you use a highly-concentrated soapy solution, try applying it at the end of the day to avoid burning the foliage."

          "headline":"Introduce a natural predator.",
          "description":"Various other species of insect love to feed upon the whitefly, and you might be able to rein in the infestation by bringing the right predator into the ecosystem. This predator will depend on the type of whitefly. Consider green lacewings, lady beetles, ladybugs, minute pirate bugs, big-eyed bugs, wasps, and damsel bugs. Be careful when intentionally introducing any new insect species to your garden. The predators may take care of your whitefly infestation \u2013 but you may soon find yourself contending with far too many of the new bug! Research before you act."

To make your own: coat a sturdy yellow surface (cardboard or wood) with a slow-drying adhesive substance. Glue, honey, motor oil, or petroleum jelly are good choices. Whiteflies are said to be attracted to the color yellow. When they flit to the yellow trap, they land and cannot free themselves from the glue. If you make your own trap, you may need to reapply the adhesive as it dries out. Glue, for instance, may dry within a matter of minutes or hours. Motor oil or petroleum jelly may be less immediately effective, but might stay sticky for longer. Make sure to remove the traps if you use a spray or a wash, or if you introduce natural predators."

Thus, they may not be well-suited to a low-level infestation unless these predators fail to keep the whiteflies in control. If the whitefly population bounces back and returns, then you can feel justified in resetting the traps."
