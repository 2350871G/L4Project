Obviously, the number of people you can have is limited by your playing space. Playing Ga Ga Start the game by having a designated person say \"Ga\". Have everyone else say \"Ga\" back, to indicate that they are ready The designated person then throws the ball against the side of the playing area or throws it up in the air. When the ball has bounced once, it is live and the game begins. Hit the ball at the other players while using your hands to block.
