      "description":"There are a number of different ways to hold knitting needles and if you have been taught only one way but you've always found it uncomfortable, liberate yourself by trying a different holding method and seeing whether your comfort level improves. The most common method for holding knitting needles is to hold the left hand needle with your left hand down about 2\" (5cm) from the needle's point, similar to the way in which you'd hold a pencil to sharpen it. Then, hold the other needle in your right hand much like holding a pen. (Switch this around if you're left handed.)"
