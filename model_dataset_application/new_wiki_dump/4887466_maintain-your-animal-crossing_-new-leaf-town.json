Citizens ask for a range of favors: they may ask you to fetch a type of fruit, insect, or fish; they may also ask you to return something that they borrowed to another citizen. The tasks are all relatively straightforward and if you forget what you are supposed to do, you can always go back and ask that citizen what they asked for."
