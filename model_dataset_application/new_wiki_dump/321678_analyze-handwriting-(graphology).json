However, since these claims have failed every scientific test, scientists consider graphology pseudoscientific and ineffective. At best these correlations are informed guesses with many exceptions.

You can see this by how dark the writing turned out, and by pressure marks on the backside of the paper. Here's what graphologists say this means:\nHigh pressure indicates high emotional energy. The writer may be intense, sensual, or vigorous. Average pressure indicates a relatively calm but anchored person. They might have good perception or memory skills. Light pressure is a sign of introversion, or someone who prefers low-energy situations."

          "description":"Writing, especially cursive writing, tends to slant to the left or right. Try analyzing it like this, paying special attention to cursive letters with upper loops (such as b, d, or h):\nA right slant shows up when the writer is eager to write, or writing quickly and energetically. If this happens often, the writer might be assertive and confident. A left slant could mean an unwillingness to write, or a desire to hide emotions. Some say these writers are less cooperative than people who slant to the right. A straight vertical slant might mean the writer keeps her emotions in check. Note \u2014This may not apply to left-handed people."

Downward writing may be a sign of discouragement or fatigue. Wavy writing that moves up and down could mean an unstable or uncertain person, or an unskilled writer."
