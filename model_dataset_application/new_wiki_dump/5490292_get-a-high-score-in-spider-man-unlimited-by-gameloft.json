          "description":"In order for the Spider-men to increase their experience, or XP, you have to level them up. The higher the levels of your Spider-men, the higher the score multipliers will be. Get your Spider-men up to their maximum levels. Common Spider-men can reach Level 30, Uncommon Spider-men can reach Level 50, Rare Spider-men can reach Level 70, and Epic Spider-men can reach Level 90. You can level up your characters by doing the following:\nPlay the Unlimited Mode. The Unlimited Mode is the classic endless runner game, where the main objective is to run as far as you can and get the highest score possible. The higher score you get, the more XP points you earn. Once a Spider-man\u2019s progress bar for its current level has reached its maximum, the Spider-man will be levelled up. Play the Events. Events are time-limited endless runner games, similar to Unlimited Mode but with different objectives and rewards. The higher score you get, the more XP points you earn. Once a Spider-man\u2019s progress bar for its current level has reached its maximum, the Spider-man will be levelled up. Play the Missions. Each mission has a defined objective, and the game ends when the objective has been reached or you\u2019ve lost. XP points are awarded for completing every mission. Once a Spider-man\u2019s progress bar for its current level has reached its maximum, the Spider-man will be levelled up. Go on Ops. The Spidey Ops contain at least four different ops with varying objectives, times, and rewards. This is a good way to use your Spider-men to earn some Vials and increase XP points while you\u2019re out or not using them. If the ops was successful, each of the Spider-men you sent on the ops will be awarded with an increase XP points. Once a Spider-man\u2019s progress bar for its current level has reached its maximum, the Spider-man will be levelled up. Level up using other Spider-men. Levelling up a Spider-man means using your other Spider-men as XP points and merging them to add to this Spider-man\u2019s current XP points or level. The Spider-men used to level up will be removed from your team roster. The XP points will increase the Spider-man\u2019s current level and if it reaches the maximum, it will be levelled up."
