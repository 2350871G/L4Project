If so, place one muffin liner in each spot of the muffin pan. If you don't want to use liners, spray both pans with nonstick baking spray so your cupcakes come out easily after baking. Consider using liners if you'll be serving the cupcakes at a party or to a group. The liners ensure that you won't be touching the sides of the cupcakes when you're frosting them."

Cream them together using your stand mixer or using a handheld mixer. Beat the butter and sugar for several minutes until the mixture is soft and fluffy. Add in 1 heaping tablespoon of red food coloring paste and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract. Beat to combine the color and flavoring. If you prefer to leave out the food coloring, your cupcakes will only have a slightly reddish hue. You may be able to find all-natural food coloring at some specialty grocery stores."

Add another 1/3 of the dry mixture and beat until it's just combined. Add the last egg and stir till it's incorporated. Add the final 1/3 of the dry mixture and stir till it's just combined. If your stand mixer has a splash guard or shield, consider placing it on the bowl. This will prevent the dry mixture from flying out. Or you can just make sure that your mixer is set to low."

Your batter is now ready to divide into your two prepared muffin pans. You may want to start by filling them all halfway and then go back and add more batter so they're equal.

If you have a stand mixer, set the bowl in the mixer with a beater attachment or you can just use a handheld mixer. Beat the ingredients on medium speed until they're completely combined and smooth. Be sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. If your ingredients aren't soft or at room temperature, the frosting will have lumps. You'll know your cream cheese and butter are soft enough if you press them and you can see an imprint of your finger."

Keep the mixer going until all the sugar is added and combined with the butter/cream cheese mixture. Your cream cheese frosting should be light, fluffy and ready to use. Powdered sugar is also called confectioners' sugar. It's important to sift it before you add it to the butter to prevent lumps from forming. If you want a firmer frosting, you can add extra powdered sugar, beating in about 1/4 cup at a time."

Spread the frosting around the top of each cupcake so that it's evenly covered. If you frost the cupcakes while they're still warm, the frosting will slide off the cupcake or melt into the cupcake. This is why it's important to let them cool first."

          "description":"You can serve the frosted cupcakes immediately or garnish them before serving. Consider sprinkling them with red sprinkles or a dusting of cocoa powder. If you plan on storing the cupcakes to serve later, store them in an airtight container and refrigerate them for up to one day. If you know you won't be serving these the same day, it's best to make the cupcakes and frosting without topping them. Refrigerate the cupcakes and frosting separately. Then you can take them out and frost them an hour or two before serving."
