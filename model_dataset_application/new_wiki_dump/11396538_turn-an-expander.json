Look for the hole in your expander on the piece of flat metal at the roof of your mouth. Stick the key down into the hole at the front of your mouth until it\u2019s firmly in place. The key has a safety bend in it which prevents you from poking your mouth, making it impossible to push too far into the expander\u2019s hole.

As you\u2019re moving the hole with the key in it backwards, a new hole will start to appear in its place. Once you can see the entire new hole, you\u2019ve done one full turn. Whether you have an upper expander or a lower one, the key will always be turned towards the back of your mouth. If you're having trouble turning the expander, make sure there isn't any food around it and that the key is properly inserted. Never do more than 1 full turn at a time."

Be very careful not to accidentally pull back on the key, turning the expander\u2019s hole back to where it started. Gently wiggle the key if you\u2019re having trouble pulling it out without reversing the turn. If you accidentally pull the hole back the wrong way, slide the key back into the hole and fix the turn. Look for the new hole once the key is removed to make sure you did the turn correctly."
