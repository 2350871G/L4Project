You can get webbing in cotton, nylon, polyester, and polypropylene materials. Cotton webbing is good for sewing handles on purses, while a synthetic fabric webbing works well for load bearing projects, such as for backpacks. Some types of webbing are 1 solid color, while others have designs printed on them. You can even find webbing with ribbon sewn onto the surface as an accent."

Rounding up to the nearest yard or half yard will help to ensure that you have enough. For example, if you need 2.75 yards (2.51 m) of webbing, then you may want to purchase 3 yards (2.7 m) of webbing."

          "description":"Most webbing is between 1 to 2.5 inches (2.5 to 6.4 cm) in width, but you may be able to find narrower or wider webbing from craft stores and online retailers. Consider what will work best for your project. For example, if you are adding straps to a backpack, you may want webbing that is 2 inches (5.1 cm) wide to provide comfort and stability. Or, if you are making a small purse, then 1 in (2.5 cm) webbing may look best."

          "description":"Webbing unravels easily, so place a piece of tape around the ends of the webbing before you trim it to the size you need for your project. Wrap the tape around the area where you plan to cut the webbing and cut along or through the tape. Do not cut down the long edges of webbing to adjust the width. Only cut across the short edges to adjust the length of a piece of webbing."

          "description":"Melting the ends of webbing can help to prevent it from unraveling. This is a good option if you do not want to leave the tape in place after sewing the webbing. Hold the ends of the webbing over an open flame, such as a lighter, for a few seconds to melt the fibers and secure the ends. If you decide to melt the ends of the webbing, make sure that you avoid sewing through this area. It may break or damage your sewing machine needle."

Make sure that the thread color matches your webbing as well. For example, if the webbing is gray, then opt for a gray thread."

A heavy-duty universal needle works best for sewing webbing. Follow your sewing machine\u2019s instructions for how to install a new needle. A size 90/14 or 100/16 needle works well for heavy fabrics, while a 110/18 or 120/19 works well for extra heavy fabrics."

Consult your sewing machine\u2019s manual for how to set your sewing machine to the zigzag stitch. You may use a different type of stitch, if desired, such as the straight stitch. The zigzag stitch is ideal because it will create a secure edge that covers a larger area."

If the sewing machine has trouble sewing through the webbing and fabric, you may continue to crank the wheel to help it along."

You may even want to backstitch across the webbing after you reach the end to ensure that it is secured. Hold down the lever on the side of your machine while still applying pressure to the pedal. This will reverse the direction of the machine so you can sew back across the area you just stitched. Repeat this process to sew the other end of your webbing."
