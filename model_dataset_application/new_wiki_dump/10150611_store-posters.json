          "description":"Depending on how many posters you have, you may need to store one roll or many dozens of rolls. If you only have a few posters, storing them all inside a single roll will be fine. A single roll can be kept just about anywhere, but if you have many rolls, then obviously you\u2019ll need a bigger storage area. Select or create an appropriate space where rolls won\u2019t be damaged by:\nMoisture. Heat or light. Pests such as ants and termites. Objects falling on them or against them."

Acid-free plastic will save your posters from any potential damage caused by chemicals commonly found in cardboard or cheaper plastic products. You can easily find this kind of \u2018archiving\u2019 acid-free plastic online, and most large stationary or packaging stores will stock the cardboard tubes with plugs at either end."

You can either write the titles of posters directly onto these labels, or, use letters to designate each individual tube (for example, 'tube A', 'tube B', and so on) and then write numbers corresponding to poster titles. Write down poster titles, which tubes they're inside, and the numbers they correspond with in a separate ledger."

You can lay more plastic between posters if you wish, but this isn\u2019t essential. Roll the posters inside the plastic, then tape the plastic so it stays rolled up.
