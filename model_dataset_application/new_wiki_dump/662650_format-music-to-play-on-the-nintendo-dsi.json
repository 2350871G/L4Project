Un-check \"Use input file directory if possible\" and browse for the folder you set up in step 2. Change the File name pattern to \"<filename>\" to be sure that no songs get overwritten when the converter runs. Click the \"Configure encoder\" button. Click the \"Bitrate per channel\" radio button and use the slider to set the quality you want. Note: In most situations, it's best to leave it at 64 kbps. The larger the bitrate, the larger the file. The smaller the bitrate, the lower the quality. Select the \"Format\" tab and select the \"MP4\" file format radio button. Click both \"OK\" buttons to close the settings windows."
