Take care not to rub the soap too hard, or the soap scum will obscure the mirror completely. You can do this exact same experiment with liquid soap or Vaseline. If you are concerned about the appearance of your mirror after rubbing soap on it, use window cleaner to clean away any excess soap. This should leave your mirror looking clear, even after being subjected to steam. If you don\u2019t want to do the whole mirror or can\u2019t reach parts, just cover the parts that you need (like the area where your face will be.)"

Use your paper towel to wipe the shampoo over whatever part of your mirror you want to keep clear. Then, take a clean paper towel and use that to wipe the mirror dry. Use twice the amount of shampoo you would normally use to wash your hair. Make sure to wipe the mirror completely dry, otherwise you will end up with a blurry looking mirror. This same trick can be done using shaving cream, toothpaste and laundry detergent. Use whichever one you have handy."

Pour the mixture into an empty spray bottle and spray the mixture directly onto your mirror. Use a paper towel to wipe the mirror down. For a little more defogging power, add a few drops of dish soap to your mixture. This method should last a couple of days, so continue to re-spray your mirror as necessary."

          "description":"Your mirror becomes foggy when the water vapors from your hot shower condense and touch a colder surface (like your mirror.) To prevent your mirror from fogging, run your shower water on cold for 30 seconds before switching over to hot. This will keep your shower and the surrounding areas cool, so that when you switch over to hot water, the fog will not form as quickly. Keep in mind that the fog will form eventually, so if you are taking an exceptionally long shower, you may still see some fog on your mirror when you emerge. Also keep in mind that the success of this strategy relies on the length of the shower and the size of your bathroom. A bigger bathroom will take longer to form fog, while a smaller bathroom will fog up faster. If you have a smaller bathroom, run the cold water for a longer period of time."

If you can\u2019t drape the towel because of the way your mirror is hung, try sticking it to the wall using putty or thumb tacks. Just watch out for holes in your wall!"

This will prevent the water vapors from forming on your mirrors, causing the fog to appear. This method is generally more unpleasant in the winter and should be reserved for warmer months so you don\u2019t get sick."

Take out a hair dryer and aim it at your mirror (keep the dryer close to the mirror, but not close enough that it touches the mirror.) Continue blasting the mirror until the fog clears up. You can set the hair dryer to either hot or cool, it should work either way."

To use it, either wipe it or spray it directly onto your mirror and then pat your mirror down to dry. This is the most successful method of keeping your mirror from fogging and can last for up to 27 days at a time. Keep a bottle under the sink in your bathroom and do a quick spray every month."

This method is both expensive and time consuming and is therefore not recommended if you are renting your home. Because the pad utilizes electricity and because you will have to remove your mirror to install it, you should hire a professional to take care of it. Depending on the size of your mirror, the pad will cost at minimum, upwards of 100 dollars."
