(Discard the beans or save the chickpeas for another purpose.) Beat the liquid on high speed for about 3-4 minutes. You have achieved the correct consistency when, upon removing the tongs from the batter, soft peaks form and then collapse quickly. Beat the vanilla extract and the cream of tartar into the bowl, and slowly add the sugar while you're beating. Add about 1/4 cup at a time, beat until consistent, then keep adding until you've added all of the sugar. Continue to beat until the batter is firm. At this point in the process, the peaks should hold their forms more solidly. It may take about 6-7 minutes to obtain this consistency. Making Cookies With The Batter Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0F (100\u00b0C). (These meringues will be baking for about 2 hours.) Line an ungreased cookie sheet with wax paper, and use a pastry bag or a spoon to dollop the meringue batter into even mounds.  Place the meringue sheet in the oven for about 2 hours, and supervise in the final 30 minutes. The cookies should be firm, but not burnt. Enjoy your meringue cookies!
