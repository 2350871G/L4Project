          "description":"Before changing any light bulb, always make sure you\u2019ve turned off the light switch. Standard incandescent and halogen bulbs get too hot to touch, so let them cool before trying to replace them. It might take at least 15 to 20 minutes for a bulb to cool to room temperature.Before touching the bulb, hold the back of your hand close to it. Without touching it, use your hand to gauge how hot it is. Fluorescent bulbs don\u2019t get too hot and might not need any time to cool. They\u2019re designed to produce light without giving off much heat."

If you can\u2019t reach the bulb with a step stool, use an A-frame ladder.For standard 8 to 9 ft (2.4 to 2.7 m) ceilings, you can most likely reach the bulb using a step stool without any help. However, if you need to climb high up on a ladder to change a bulb, it\u2019s wise to have a helper hold the ladder. Never stand on the top step of a ladder or step stool."

          "description":"Most glass dome ceiling fixtures have at least 1 screw that keeps the dome in place. If you\u2019re changing the bulb in a dome fixture, locate the screw on the side where dome meets the ceiling. For a ceiling fan, check the base of the dome where it connects to the fan body.Hold the dome in place as you turn the screw counterclockwise to loosen it. Instead of completely removing the screw, just loosen it until you can remove the dome. You\u2019ll have an easier time removing the dome without dropping it, and you won\u2019t have to deal with trying to get the screw back into the hole. If your dome doesn\u2019t have any screws, check the tip at the center of the dome. See if you can turn it counterclockwise; the tip might conceal a nut and bolt that secures the dome. Be sure to hold the dome as you loosen the bolt. If your fixture doesn\u2019t have a glass dome or cover, you can skip right to removing the light bulb."

Hold the ends of the tape and fold the middle section in half to make a handle.Don\u2019t let the ends of the tape touch each other as you fold the middle section. The result should be a T-shaped handle made by the folded middle section with 2 sticky edges on either side. Repeat the steps to make another duct tape handle. Stick the tape handles to the glass cover, then use them to turn the cover counterclockwise. You can also try spraying a lubricant, such as WD-40, around the edge of the cover where it threads into its housing.

To pry out a spring-loaded ring, insert the screwdriver between the outer ring and the retaining collar. Taking care not to strike the bulb, apply gentle inward pressure on the collar.
