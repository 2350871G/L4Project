  "text":" Preparing the Glass Fill a small saucer with melted chocolate. Measure about a tablespoon of melted chocolate and make sure it's more towards the edges. Add raw sugar to another small saucer. Depending on the quantity of martinis you are planning to make, add a tablespoon or several to the saucer. Dip the glass rim into the chocolate. As you lift up the glass, gently swirl it to make a more cleaner appearance. Dip the glass rim into the raw sugar. Gently roll the rim in it, using the melted chocolate as an adhesive. Preparing the Martini Add crushed ice to a cocktail shaker. Fill it about halfway with ice. Add the butterscotch liqueur and cognac into the cocktail shaker.  Shake the contents. Secure the lid on and vigorously shake it for a few seconds. You will know when the contents are cold when you see condensation building up on the outside of the shaker. Drizzle the caramel topping in the glasses. Dress up the insides of each glass by drawing a zig-zag pattern around. Strain the contents. Attach a strainer on the cocktail shaker (if the shaker doesn't have one) and strain it into the martini glass. Garnish the martini. Drizzle the white chocolate liqueur on top and stick a cookie straw in each martini. Finished. ",
