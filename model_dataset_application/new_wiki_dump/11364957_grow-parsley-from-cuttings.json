          "description":"Clean off any surface dirt from your garden scissors with soapy water, then rinse them with plain water. After that, soak a cotton ball or soft cloth in rubbing alcohol and wipe down the blades of the scissors. Allow them to air dry for about 1 minute. Cleaning your garden scissors regularly greatly reduces your chances of spreading any plant diseases. Always clean the scissors right before making any cuttings. Always use sharp garden scissors so you can make clean, accurate cuts with minimal tearing."

          "headline":"Identify several leafy stems about 5 in (13 cm) long.",
          "description":"Pick out 3-4 healthy-looking stems that are a vibrant green color and have at least 3 segments of leaves at the top of each stem. Avoid stems with flowers, stems or leaves with brown areas, or stems with exceptionally large leaves. The success rate for parsley cuttings is low, so make 3-4 cuttings even if you only really want 1. Likewise, if you want 2-3, make at least 6-8 cuttings."

        {
          "headline":"Cut the stems at an angle and trim any lower leaves.",
          "description":"Instead of cutting off the stems straight across, snip them at about a 45 degree angle. Cut each stem at any point above the soil line so that it\u2019s around 4\u20136 in (10\u201315 cm) long. If there are any leaves on the bottom half of the cutting, snip them off. Snipping at an angle increases the surface area and allows the cutting to soak up water more quickly. When making cuttings of other herbs like basil or mint, snip the stem off just below a node\u2014the point where a leaf shoots off from the stem. Parsley\u2019s leaf nodes are typically near the top of the stem, so this is less important."

If possible, avoid using tap water, which contains chlorine, or distilled water, which lacks nutrients. Using an activated carbon or reverse osmosis filter will remove chlorine from tap water, as will boiling it for 20 minutes. Leaving the water in a lid-free pot for 24 hours also removes most or all of the chlorine."

Aspirin contains willow bark, which acts as a growth hormone for plants. The effectiveness of this hormonal rooting solution is based more on anecdotal observation than scientific evidence. However, it is still unlikely to harm your cuttings."

Check the pot's moisture level every 1-2 days. Test the moisture level by sticking the tip of your finger into the growing medium. If it's damp to a depth of at least 1 in (2.5 cm), it doesn't need extra water. You may only need to add water once per week, especially indoors. If there\u2019s no risk of frost, you can instead place the pot outdoors in a mostly-shady location. It\u2019s more challenging to control the moisture level outdoors, though."

Look for white roots emerging from the submerged part of the cutting. If the roots reach 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm) long, consider your effort a success. You can start the process of transplanting your rooted cuttings into pots or the soil. If there\u2019s no sign of root growth after 3 weeks and the cutting is wilted and brown, it\u2019s not going to take root. Hopefully, at least one of your several cuttings will make it!"
