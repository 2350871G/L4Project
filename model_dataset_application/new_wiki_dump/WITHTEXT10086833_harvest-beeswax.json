Typically, bees leave in the morning to search for pollen and return to the hive at the end of the day. This way, you are less likely to get stung! Having fewer bees around makes it easier to access the frames and get the wax caps, as well. Bees can get in your way and make the process more difficult."

Be sure your face is completely covered by the mesh and that the suit is secured in the back. If you don\u2019t have a beekeeper\u2019s outfit, wear as thick of clothing as you can.

Then, pry the lid off of your hive using a hive tool, and blow the smoke at the entrance of the hive and into the opening. The smoke from the smoker gives the bees the impression that the hive is on fire, so they begin to feast on the honey as a way to preserve it. Eating a lot of honey makes the bees get drowsy, so they are less likely to bother you as you get the wax caps out of the hive. A hive tool resembles a crowbar."
