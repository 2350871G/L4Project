  "text":" Making the Teriyaki Sauce Over high heat, bring the mirin in a medium saucepan to a boil. Once at a boil, turn heat down to medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes. Add soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, and sugar. Stir until fully incorporated. If you desire a thicker Teriyaki sauce, add 2 teaspoons of cornstarch dissolved in a little bit of water to the sauce. Cornstarch will help thicken the Teriyaki sauce and let it bind more to the outside of the chicken. Add the seasonings to the sauce at this point. Add the garlic, ginger, pepper flakes, and pepper. Continue to simmer for 5 more minutes. Remove from the burner and let cool for 10 minutes. Preparing the Chicken Be sure that the Teriyaki sauce has sufficiently cooled before using. Too-hot sauce will also have the unpleasant side-effect of beginning to cook your chicken. Transfer all but 1/4 cup of the Teriyaki sauce to a sealable plastic bag, along with the chicken. The reserve sauce can be used either as a baste at the end of the cooking process or as a dipping sauce. Refrigerate the marinade and the chicken for at least an hour but preferably a day. Up to a day, the longer you marinade your chicken, the juicier and more flavorful it will eventually turn out. When you're ready to start cooking, remove the chicken from the sealable bag and set a burner at medium heat. Discard \u2014 do not use \u2014 the marinade that came in contact with the chicken. Cook chicken in a large pan for 6 minutes, covered, without flipping.  Flip the chicken and cook, covered, for another 6 minutes. The chicken should start to develop good color on both sides.
