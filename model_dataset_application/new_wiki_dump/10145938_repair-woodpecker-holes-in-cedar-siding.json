This will prevent your repairs from popping out of the siding. If there is anything behind the hole to hammer a nail into, you can also use a nail to achieve the same effect. Leave the head of the nail slightly exposed so that your epoxy putty will lock onto it when it expands."

Scrape away any excess with the putty knife when you\u2019re done and allow it to air dry. Epoxy putty is a commonly recommended wood filler for use in repairing woodpecker damage. Overfill the entire hole in your siding when applying the filler; it\u2019s critical that you leave no void uncovered, and excess putty is easily removed. Make sure you fill the holes in your siding on a day with good weather, so the filler has enough time to air dry."

To get rid of carpenter bees, locate the small holes they\u2019ve bored into your wood and hang traps directly over them.

Hanging ceramic animals and reflective objects on your siding will make woodpeckers think a predator is nearby. Prowler owls and hawks with reflective eyes are particularly effective at warding off woodpeckers, as these are their natural predators. Hang aluminum foil or brightly colored strips of plastic along your siding for a low-cost visual deterrent."

If your structure is in an area with neighbors living close by, consider getting their blessing first before using loud noises to deter woodpeckers, or rely solely on visual deterrents. Unless you\u2019re physically available to make jarring noises nearly every time the woodpecker shows up, this method will probably not be as effective as using visually frightening objects."

Though you can use a normal bird feeder, you\u2019ll probably have more success using suet, a high-calorie bird food. Every few days, place your feeder further and further away from your structure, until the woodpeckers stop drilling in your siding.
