      "headline":"Move Pac-Man.",
      "description":"Pac-Man starts at the bottom of the maze. Move him by swiping towards the direction you want him to turn. If you want to move him up, swipe up. If you want to turn him left, swipe left. Pac-Man will start moving. If you have the game sounds on, you can hear the classic chomping sound as Pac-Man moves through the maze."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Eat Pac-dots.",
      "description":"The maze is filled with Pac-dots for Pac-Man to eat. Your score is based on the number of dots you eat in the game before getting hit by the glitch or a ghost. Move Pac-Man across the maze and eat as many Pac-dots as possible."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Avoid ghosts.",
      "description":"Avoid the different colored ghosts in the maze. Once you hit one, it\u2019s game over. Different ghosts move and act differently in the maze, so observe their movements and plan your turns."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Eat fruits.",
      "description":"Aside from the Pac-dots, there are a few fruits scattered on the maze. These fruits will multiply your scores. When you see one, see if you can eat it without risking getting eaten by ghosts."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Eat a Power Pellet.",
      "description":"You may also see Power Pellets every so often. These are the white round items, much bigger than the Pac-dots. When you see one, try to eat it. It will give Pac-Man invincibility against the ghosts for a short time. All the ghosts will turn blue and Pac-Man can eat them, which adds to your score. When the ghosts start blinking white, it means the power is ending and you should go back to avoiding ghosts again. You don\u2019t want to be near one when it turns back to their original color."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Get Power-Ups.",
      "description":"The main difference between Free Play and 1 Credit is the use of power-ups. There are various power-ups available in the maze. If you see items not resembling Pac-dots, fruits, or pellet, most likely these are the power-ups. Get Pac-Man to them to give it some special powers for a short duration, much like when it eats a Power Pellet. Some power-ups will allow Pac-Man to shoot lasers at ghosts, while some will temporarily freeze the ghosts in their places."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Move up.",
      "description":"Whatever you do, always move up. After a few seconds from starting, the glitch will begin from the bottom and it will eat up the maze. If Pac-Man gets hit by the glitch, it\u2019s game over."

    {
      "headline":"Beat your best score.",
      "description":"Continue playing and beat your highest score. The further up the maze you go, the more Pac-dots you can eat, and the more points you get. Eating the fruits and the ghosts will also increase your score. Your score is displayed at the top part of the maze as you play."
