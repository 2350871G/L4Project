Even if you want to decorate an old diary, just make sure to place it under a heavy pile of books overnight so that it flattens the surface and gives you a perfect area to work on. For an old file, you could simply take the pages out, work on it and put the papers back when you are done decorating it. This way you could even try this DIY on an old, grungy file or diary you want to preserve."
