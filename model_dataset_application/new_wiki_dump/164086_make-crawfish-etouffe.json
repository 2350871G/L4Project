      "headline":"Make your roux.",
      "description":"This step is found in many Cajun recipes, and it involves browning the flour that is the thickening ingredient for the \"gravy\" the Crawfish are cooked in. Place equal amounts of cooking oil and all purpose flour in a large cast iron skillet over medium heat (1/2 cup is about right for this dish). Stir continuously until the flour is browned, keeping it from overcooking or scorching. The color of the roux is very important. A good Etouffee roux should be the color of shelled pecans."

      "description":"Simmer until the roux is completely dissolved and the liquid in the pot is thickened. It should be the consistency of a regular gravy, without lumps and uniform in color and texture. Add salt and pepper to taste. The best flavor is achieved by mixing red, white and black pepper in quantities to suit your own taste."
