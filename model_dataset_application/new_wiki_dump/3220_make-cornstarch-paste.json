Thoroughly mix the two ingredients together. As the cornstarch absorbs water the mixture will thicken and begin to resemble glue. For thin cornstarch paste, use 3 tablespoon (44.4 ml) of cold water and 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of cornstarch. For thick cornstarch paste, use equal parts cold water and cornstarch. Because the starch may settle, stir the simple cornstarch paste just before using it."
