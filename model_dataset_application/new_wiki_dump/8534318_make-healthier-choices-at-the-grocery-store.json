          "description":"Healthier choices at the grocery store start before you get there. You first need to make a healthy plan for your meals. Pick recipes that include lean proteins (think fish, skinless chicken, and beans), whole grains, low-fat dairy, fruits, and vegetables. Once you know what meals you want to make it, you'll find the grocery store much easier to navigate. If meal planning isn't your forte, try using a meal-planning app, which will do a lot of the work for you. Plan for some quick meals on those nights when you can't manage something elaborate. For example, you could choose something easy, like a fresh salad, or you could make more one night so you have leftovers the next night. If you have children, include them in the meal planning process. This will ensure that you pick healthy foods that your children will eat. Your children may also enjoy helping out in the kitchen as you cook these meals."

A list is important because if you don't make a list, you're more likely to take detours into less healthy sections of the grocery store. Once you've got a list, try to stick to it. Include healthy snacks on your list. It's unreasonable to think you won't want any snacks, and if you leave it to when you're in the grocery store (or worse, standing in front of a vending machine), you're not likely to make healthy choices. Pick things like frozen yogurt, air-popped popcorn, whole grain crackers, low-fat cheese, fruits, vegetables, and hummus. Many meal-planning apps will also create a grocery list for you. You can also get apps exclusively to help you create grocery lists."

That's likely to lead to you crashing and burning, and then you'll go back to your less healthy choices. Instead, make changes slowly, trying to make a single healthier choice each week. For example, try a no-sugar added canned fruit instead of one in syrup, or try picking whole-wheat bread instead of white bread."
