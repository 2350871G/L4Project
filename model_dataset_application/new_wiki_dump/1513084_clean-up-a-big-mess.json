          "description":"This is a good first step as it will give you more room to see what else needs to be cleaned. Scan the surfaces in your room, such as your desk and bed, and look for anything that should be thrown out. Pick up old bits of paper, food wrappers, and things you don\u2019t want. Check on the floor and under your bed for any other rubbish that can be taken away. Bring a trash bag into your room so that you can throw rubbish away as you find it. Place your paper and cardboard into a separate bag so you can recycle it. Take plates and cups to the kitchen rather than throwing them out."

If it is clean, place it in your drawers or hang it up in your wardrobe. If it is dirty, put it into a washing basket. Fold up your clothes before you put them into your drawers. Otherwise, you will just have messy drawers instead of a messy room. If you aren\u2019t sure if something is clean or dirty, place it into the washing basket."

This will condense the mess into one place and help it look less overwhelming. Take each item out of the basket and find a place to store it. Place all your books on your bookshelf, all your school work into a file, and all your shoes into your wardrobe. Throw out, or giveaway, any items that you don\u2019t want anymore."

Continue to push the vacuum back and forth until the carpet looks fresh and clean. It may take a while if you haven\u2019t vacuumed for a while.

If your sheets haven\u2019t been changed for a few weeks, take the opportunity to take them off your bed and replace them with clean ones.
