Place the center of the loop end of the tassel over the button at the top of the cap with the tassel toward the front of the cap. To do so, you must bend the loop in half and start passing the tassel side of the loop through the loop end. This will create a hole which the button can be placed through and when the tassel is then pulled tight, it will be securely held on the cap's button by friction and gravity. Gently tug both sides of the loop under the button edge to lock it into place. Criss cross your loop under the button, and pull until you hear it snap."

You could use a drop of glue on the end of the tassel before fastening it to the button. You could also use adhesive tape for the same purpose. Basically, you are sliding the loop at the top of the tassel onto the button at the center of the top of your mortarboard. Tug gently on the tassel to make sure it's firmly seated under the button. The glue or adhesive is just extra support."
