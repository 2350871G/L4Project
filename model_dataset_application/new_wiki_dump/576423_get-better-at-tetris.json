          "description":"Start a game of Tetris and simply rotate each block. Note how each individual piece moves and commit the number of times that you need to press the button to turn a piece a certain way to memory. Knowing the order will give you free time to look at the preview box, mound, and well since you won\u2019t need to monitor a piece while rotating it. At higher levels of play, players don\u2019t even look at the pieces as they fall. They know exactly how many times they have to turn a piece and only pay attention to moving it left or right."

This will help you plan your next move and make it easier to determine how you want to play the board.Tip: Some versions of Tetris have a \u201cbank\u201d function where you can press a button and send a piece in the preview pane to the bank for later use. Use this to save your I pieces for Tetris or to throw away pieces you can\u2019t cleanly place at the current moment. For example, if you have a tall mound and you\u2019re debating on whether you need to burn some rows or not, checking for an I piece can save you from unnecessary burning."

          "description":"Part of getting better at Tetris is adjusting to the way that pieces drop at different speeds as the levels progress. As the levels increase, you\u2019ll need to move faster, build smaller mounds, and rotate pieces more accurately. Play on marathon mode when practicing alone to get used to the way levels progress. Games of competitive Tetris usually start at level 5 or 10. If you\u2019re already pretty good with the basics, go ahead and start your marathon runs from these positions."

          "description":"While the scoring systems vary, every version of Tetris awards the highest score for clearing 4 rows of bricks at once. The only way to do this is to build up a mound that is at least 4 rows tall while leaving a single column completely open for the I piece. When you finally get an I piece, place it vertically in the column that you left open to score a \u201cTetris\u201d and get the most points possible. Scoring in Tetris refers to the number of rows that you clear at a time. A single is when you clear 1 row, a double is 2 rows, a triple is 3 rows, and a Tetris is 4 rows. You get a huge set of bonus points for scoring a Tetris. In competitive Tetris, the term \u201cTetris rate\u201d refers to the percentage of your points that come from scoring Tetrises. If your Tetris rate is over 50%, you\u2019re doing really well."

Score singles, doubles, and triples above and underneath the obscured section to clear the column out instead of trying to score a Tetris on top of it. As you level up in Tetris, the rate at which the pieces fall increases. This means that it\u2019s more advantageous to lose some points early on by clearing a well out for a Tetris than it is to build Tetrises on top of a mound.

Because of the delay before a piece settles, you can rotate a T piece into a slot at the last moment to fit it in unexpected ways. To do this, press the rotate button right before a T piece settles and it will spin into a slot that it otherwise wouldn\u2019t have fit into.Tip: You can spin any piece that can be rotated. The reason the T-spin is so important though is because the T can be rotated to fill in open cells under the S, Z, L, and J pieces while those 4 can only be oriented in one direction. For example, if there is a gap created by an overhang on your mound where a T brick could fit from the side, you wouldn\u2019t be able to drop it directly in. You could, however, lower it next to the opening and the rotate it at the last minute to settle the cell that sticks out snuggly into the opening. The T spin cannot accurately be performed if you don\u2019t have the rotations for the T piece memorized. Tucking generally refers to simply sliding a piece, while spinning it refers to rotating it into a slot. The principles behind the 2 moves are the same though\u2014you\u2019re filling in a hidden slot by moving at the last possible second."

To save time, learn to hyper-tap by tapping a button repeatedly instead of holding it down to move a piece left or right. When you get to higher levels, tapping the button will be more efficient than holding it down. Hyper-tapping can cause a lot of strain on your hands and wrists.
