          "description":"Naturally, young coconuts are smaller than older ones since they haven\u2019t yet finished growing. In fact, a mature coconut can often be as much as 25-50% bigger than one that\u2019s not ready to come down yet. By the time a coconut is ripe, it will have grown to an average of 12\u201318 inches (30\u201346 cm) in length and 6\u20138 inches (15\u201320 cm) in diameter. Coconuts can vary in size, depending on the tree. For this reason, it\u2019s usually best to go by color or texture when deciding whether a coconut is ready to harvest. Coconuts growing in bunches all tend to develop and ripen at the same rate."

          "headline":"Squeeze the coconut to ensure that it's firm.",
          "description":"The palm of a young coconut (the rubbery outer shell surrounding the brown, fibrous nut) should be dense and smooth with little give. Coconuts in the middle stages of development tend to soften a bit, and may display some light wrinkles or depressions. The once-smooth exterior will become wrinkled and woody as the fruit reaches maturity. Until the coconut is ripe enough to drop on its own, it will need to be harvested manually."

          "headline":"Look for a golden brown color.",
          "description":"Like other fruits, young coconuts start off with a pale green color. As the fruit ripens, it will begin to develop a golden yellow hue. Eventually, it will turn brown and any residual color will fade. The coconut will fall off the tree soon after reaching this point. Green coconuts (around 5-6 months old) have the highest water content, and are usually harvested for drinking purposes. When the coconut turns yellow (after 7-9 months), some of the water solidifies into \u201cjelly,\u201d or meat, which can be extracted and eaten or processed as a cooking ingredient. By the time a coconut turns brown (12-16 months old), most of the water inside will have been turned to milk. Mature coconuts are most often used to make creams and oils."

          "headline":"Make or buy a coconut harvesting pole.",
          "description":"These tools are typically made by attaching a long, curved blade to the end of a bamboo shaft. A standard harvesting pole can be anywhere from 25\u201330 feet (7.6\u20139.1 m) long, which makes it possible to cut down coconuts from the safety of the ground. Be on the lookout for a stalk of bamboo that's long enough to reach to the top of the tree where the coconuts are growing and big enough around to attach a harvesting scythe to the end. If you live in an area where coconut harvesting is a common practice, it may be possible to find special telescopic tools made from lightweight materials like carbon fiber or aluminum. They're also available online. Pole-picking is the method of choice in countries like India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and New Zealand."

          "description":"Move a safe distance away from the base of the tree and stand the pole straight up on its end. Zero in on the coconut you want to cut and slowly and carefully guide the blade towards it. Try to hook the blade directly over the palm where it connects to the bunch. Hold the harvesting pole tightly with both hands. Not only will this make it easier to control, it will also decrease your chances of losing your grip. Make sure there's no one else in the immediate vicinity that the pole could potentially injure if it happens to topple over."

          "description":"Once you've got the blade hooked over the top of the palm, pull back on the pole with a forceful slashing action. The blades attached to harvesting poles are extremely sharp, so one or two hacks should be enough to bring it down. Be patient. Since you\u2019re working from an imprecise distance, it may take a few moments to successfully sever the coconut from the bunch."

          "description":"Using a harvesting pole requires you to stand directly underneath the palms you\u2019re collecting coconuts from, so be ready to duck out of the way if you see one plummeting towards you. The best way to do this is to move continuously around the tree in a zig-zag pattern as you work. It may look silly, but it beats getting conked on the head by a ripe coconut! According to some statistics, falling coconuts kill as many as 150 people per year worldwide."

Twist the loop once in the center to make a figure-8 shape. Place a foot on each of the resulting stirrups and position yourself next to the base of the tree. For best results, try to make sure your foot strap is no wider than the tree. Shorter straps are able to support more weight, which can allow you to \u201cstand\u201d on the trunk while you loosen the coconuts by hand. Double-knot the rope or cloth to make sure it will hold.

If you've made your own foot strap, push the center of the loop into the trunk to create traction and \u201chop\u201d up little by little. Take your time and be extremely careful. If necessary, pause every few seconds to rest before you continue. There\u2019s no need to go all the way to the top\u2014you just need to get within easy grabbing distance.

After a few spins, it should come away with little effort. If the coconut is being stubborn, you may need to pull on it gently to get it to come free. Avoid yanking or wrenching the coconut.
