Do this outside. When it's done drying, enjoy your new sword! Metal Prop Sword Get your materials. You'll need a sheet of 1/4\" flat stock aluminum, a band saw or jigsaw, a metal file, a piece of plywood, a 1-1.5\" diameter dowel rod, electrical tape or ribbon, and metal glue or epoxy. Make your template. Draw a template onto paper or cardstock to get the outline of the sword blade you want. Leave a straight portion at the bottom for the handle, about 1-1.5\" wide. Roughly cut out your sword. Trace your template onto the sheet of aluminum using a Sharpie or other marker. Then, cut it out using a band or jigsaw. Be careful: you want to cut the metal, not your fingers. When making this cut, you want to get as close to your outline as possible without actually cutting along the line. File it into shape.
