Because it is straight from the oven and not yet cooled and set, using a dry dishcloth may cause the fabric to cling to the moist cake and ruin the top layer once pulled off. Preferably, do this when the cake has come straight from the oven. With high temperatures, your cake's domed layer can be remedied prior to the time it cools and begin to set its shape."

Hold down the object against the cake's surface for a minimum of thirty seconds. Be sure that you are pressing the object down evenly, with one side not being pushed on more than another. Do not press down with too much force, or it may cause the surface your cake to appear concaved, which makes it as difficult to decorate and layer as a domed surface would."

You can begin icing the surface of the cake and, if need be, stacking any layers to form the cake of your dreams. If the surface does not flatten and the cake is still hot, cover the cake with the damp dishcloth once again and repeat the pressing process. If it does not work, your cake may have cooled too much. If this is the case, you will have to level off the domed section of your cake using a serrated knife."

Holding the knife still, slowly spin the turntable all the way around against the knife to mark off the section you want to remove. Ensure that your starting and ending points meet once you've made the complete rotation; if they do not, start off the marking process again. Using that mark as a guide, begin spinning the cake slowly on the turntable once again, pressing the knife into the cake along the original marking. Keep turning the cake and pressing the knife toward the center of it until the top layer comes right off."

          "description":"An unexpectedly helpful way to steady your hand is by placing an inexpensive sewing hoop snugly around the top of your cake. Adjust the knob so that it fits at the height at which you'd like the layer cut. Rest your serrated knife on the top edge of the hoop and slowly cut across the cake with a sawing motion, moving the blade away from the direction of your body. Moving the knife level with the hoop will keep the blade from angling down and creating a sloped surface."
