      "description":"Because of their defensive capabilities, it is important to choose your weapons well before engaging a jackal, or group jackals as there usually is. Explosive weapons or long-range weapons are key to taking down jackals with energy shield, while long to medium-range weapons will be effective against marksmen/sniper jackals. Weapons such as the needler will be fairly useless against the jackal's energy shields, so remember to plan ahead."

If that doesn't work, use a long to medium-range weapon to shoot through the gap on the side of the jackal's shield (where their weapon rests) to stun them temporarily, giving you the chance for a headshot. Sniper or marksman jackals are fairly harder to kill, especially on harder levels, so locate them and remove them carefully with a few well-placed sniper or battle rifle shots."
