  "text":" Start with a square sheet of paper. a.If you do not have a square sheet of paper, take a sheet of computer paper placed so it shorter side is facing towards you. b.fold the top edge to the left edge resulting in a folded area that looks like a right triangle and a rectangular area at the bottom. c.\tCut out the rectangular area at the bottom so you are left with only the double layered right triangle. d.\tUnfold the triangular piece \u2013 this is your square shaped piece of paper. Orient your piece of paper so it looks like a diamond \u2013 two corners should be directly in front of you while one should be to your left and the other to your right.  Fold the paper in half horizontally giving you a triangle that looks like half your diamond. Then unfold. Fold the paper in half vertically giving you a triangle that looks like half your diamond. Then unfold. At this point you should have a diamond shaped piece of paper with two folds that intersect at the center of the paper. Fold each of the corners to the center. The resulting piece of paper will look like 2 squares of paper on top of each other with the top consisting of 4 triangular shaped pieces and the bottom consisting of one square piece. Fold the top and bottom sides to the middle. This should result in a rectangular shape. Fold the left and right sides into the center. This should transform your rectangular shaped piece of paper into a square. Orient the paper again so it looks like a diamond.  Fold the paper in half horizontally giving you a triangle that looks like half your diamond. Then unfold. Fold the paper in half vertically giving you a triangle that looks like half your diamond. Then unfold. On your folded piece of paper you will notice the four original corners pointing towards the center. Take one of these and pull it out to the side. It will form a flap on the side of the first two layers of paper. It will look like the fold you just made and the fold between the corner of the square and the center make a triangle. Repeat steep eleven for every side. The resulting mass should look like a square with triangles on top and bellow it. Alternatively, it looks like two trapezoids next to each other. Turn the paper over. The folded mass should look like a six sided figure with the two long sides of the square on the left and right and the four sides of the triangles on the top and bottom. Fold the left and right sides into the center. This will fold both the square and part of the triangles. Turn the paper over. At this point the left and right sides should be much longer then they were before. Take the top pieces of paper at the center and pull them out giving you a butterfly-looking shape with four triangles in the center.  Take the tip of the top and bottom triangles, push them back, and fold them flat. By doing this, you will make the section of the paper that was these triangles into a trapezoid shape. Take the left and right triangles at the center of the paper (they contain two of the original corners and are facing the long straight edge of the paper) and pull them outwards while making sure the butterfly shape of the overall structure is maintained. By doing this, you will pull a large triangular area of paper out from inside the folds of the paper. The resulting shape of the paper looks like the structure you started with along with two large triangles at its left and right side. Turn the paper over. The paper should look like two identical five sided shapes. The five sided shapes have five corners \u2013 two that face the middle of the paper and three that don\u2019t. Take the three corners that do not face the center of the paper in each of the five sided shape and fold them to the center of the five sided shape. This center should be easy to spot as not only are there lines intersecting to the center but also there are creases where you are going to fold. The resulting shape should look like two squares side by side. For the left square take the leftmost side and fold it into the center. For the right square take the rightmost side and fold it into the center. Fold the paper in half horizontally. The resulting shape should look like a small trapezoid and rectangle in the center of the paper. Pinch the paper right at the line the rectangle and paper make and pull outwards and up slightly. This will give the paper its three dimensional shape and result in your paper ship.",
