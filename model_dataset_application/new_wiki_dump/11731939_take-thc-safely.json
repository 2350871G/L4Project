This is because vaporizing heats the THC oils and releases a vapor without also releasing smoke, tars, and other irritants that result from burning marijuana plants. To vaporize your marijuana safely, use a tabletop vaporizer (such as a Volcano Vaporizer) rather than a vape pen. If you use a vape pen or handheld vaporizer, use one that allows you to heat raw cannabis if possible.

Steer clear of these forms of marijuana, especially if you\u2019re an inexperienced user.

Talk to a doctor at a marijuana clinic or a staff member at a reputable dispensary about what you might expect from the different strains.

You should feel the effects within 1-3 minutes. Unlike smoking tobacco products, smoking marijuana has not been shown to cause health problems such as cancer or COPD.

Tinctures are drops or sprays that you apply to the inside of your cheeks or under your tongue, where the THC can be quickly absorbed into your bloodstream. Use 1-2 drops or puffs of spray, then wait up to 1 hour to see if you get the results you want. If not, you can add a little more.

It can be hard to judge the dosage you\u2019re getting with some edibles, such as baked goods. To control the amount you consume more precisely, try using pills or capsules. Many pre-made edibles, such as gummies, are also labeled with the exact dosage of THC they contain (such as 5 mg per gummy).Did You Know? You can get edible THC products in the form of baked goods (like brownies, cookies, or cakes), gummies and other candies, and even beverages, such as THC-infused coffee or tea.

Secondhand smoke from marijuana can have an impact on the health of children and animals. Don\u2019t smoke or vaporize cannabis products around pets or kids, and always keep these products locked up and out of the reach of children and animals when you\u2019re not using them. If you think a child has ingested cannabis, call emergency services or your local poison control hotline immediately. If you live in the U.S., you can reach the national Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222. If you think your pet has ingested cannabis, call your vet right away. Refrain from drinking alcohol while you\u2019re using THC. THC can interact with alcohol and make its effects more powerful. Similarly, alcohol can increase the effects of THC. To reduce your risk of developing alcohol poisoning or other unwanted side effects, don\u2019t use THC and alcohol together. One of the dangers of mixing THC and alcohol is that using THC can make it harder for you to vomit. This means that if you drink too much alcohol, your body will have a harder time getting the excess alcohol out of your system. Working with Your Doctor Talk to your doctor before trying THC. While taking THC can be beneficial for many people, it can also have a variety of potential risks and side effects. Before you use THC, consult with your doctor to find out if it\u2019s likely to be safe and effective for you. Your doctor can also recommend safe products and talk to you about how to use them correctly. If they\u2019re not experienced with THC, they may be able to refer you to a doctor who is. If you\u2019re already using marijuana, be open and honest with your doctor about it. Explain to them that you want to know more about the potential risks and benefits of using THC for your health. If your doctor thinks you can benefit from using medical marijuana, they may prescribe a THC-based pharmaceutical, such as dronabinol or Sativex. These medications are typically prescribed to treat symptoms associated with chemotherapy side effects, HIV/AIDS, cancer, and multiple sclerosis. Discuss any current health conditions you have with your doctor. THC may cause problems for people with certain health conditions. Talk to your doctor about your health history and any current issues you may be having so that they can advise you on whether it\u2019s safe for you to use THC. Your doctor may recommend that you avoid using THC if you are pregnant or nursing, have any psychiatric conditions (such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder), or have heart, kidney, liver, or lung disease. Give your doctor a list of any medications you\u2019re currently taking. It\u2019s possible that THC or other cannabinoids could interact with other medications or supplements. Before you try THC, give your doctor a full list of any prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or dietary supplements you\u2019re currently using. They can let you know whether you can safely use them in combination with THC. THC may interact with medications such as barbiturates (sleep medications), antihistamines, disulfiram, theophylline, fluoxetine, and blood thinners. Follow your doctor\u2019s dosage instructions carefully. Taking too much THC can cause unwanted side effects. Using carefully-controlled doses can help reduce your risk of side effects or other complications. Work with your doctor to choose doses that are safe and effective for you. Your doctor may advise starting with an amount lower than the recommended dose, then gradually increasing the amount of THC you consume until you get the desired effect. Seek medical help if you experience serious side effects. Most side effects from THC are relatively mild, but it can sometimes cause severe symptoms. Stop using THC and get medical help immediately if you experience effects such as panic attacks, severe nausea, and vomiting, convulsions, or symptoms of psychosis (such as hallucinations, severe paranoia, or delusions). More common side effects of THC include headaches, dry mouth, dry or red eyes, coughing, dizziness, drowsiness or fatigue, increased appetite, anxiety, and feelings of disconnectedness from reality.",
