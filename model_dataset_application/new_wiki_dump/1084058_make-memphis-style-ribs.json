  "text":" Take the membrane off the backside of the ribs. This is the whitish film on the back of the ribs. It might take a little work to get off. Mix your garlic, cayenne, paprika, black pepper, salt, and brown sugar in a small mixing bowl. This will be your dry rub. Just until they all blend together. Does not need a lot of work. After your ingredients are combined rub them onto your ribs, then cover and refrigerate for at least two hours. Overnight would be best. After you have let your ribs soak in the dry rub, take them out of the refrigerator.  Pre-heat your oven to 250 degrees F (130 degrees C).  Place each of your racks on different pieces of tinfoil.  Fold the extra tinfoil up on the sides of ribs to make tents but do not close them up yet.  Take the remaining ingredients and combine them together in a saucepan. Bring the mixture to a low boil and then let cool. This will be your braising liquid. Divide the braising liquid between the two racks and pour it into the tinfoil tents.  Now seal up the tinfoil, but do not make it airtight because this can cause the foil to burst.  Place the \"tents\" on a baking sheet and put in the oven for 2-3 hours until ribs are tender.  After they are tender put under the broiler for about 10 minutes. At this point you can put on a glaze or barbecue sauce of your choice. Enjoy Your \"Memphis Style\" Ribs ",
