Throw away all obvious trash, such as wrappers and old mail, and if you have a little extra time, assess your space for usefulness.

          "description":"Having a large amount of clutter in the area can make starting more intimidating. Gather anything that\u2019s out of place, such as toys, video games, books, papers, etc., and put in a pile in the middle of the room. Once you\u2019ve gathered all the clutter, start putting each piece back where it belongs. To keep the pile contained, use a laundry basket to hold all the clutter as you collect it. Making this pile first will help you focus on that one main task and makes the room look cleaner faster--seeing visible progress can be encouraging and motivating! Completing this task daily will keep clutter from piling up and becoming overwhelming the next time you clean. If you\u2019re in a hurry to clean up for company and you run out of time, the basket can be put out of sight and organized later. However, if you have time, it is best to take a few minutes and put things back in their places right away."

This way, you can maximize your time and effort and make the room look visibly cleaner. Fluff pillows, straighten seat cushions, and fold any blankets to tidy up this area. Use a handheld vacuum or a vacuum wand extension to pick up any crumbs, hair, or lint on the upholstery."

Microfiber cloths are perfect for this step. Dust from top to bottom, as dust falls and settles. This way you won't have to go back over areas that you\u2019ve already cleaned.

When cleaning the light fixture, turn on the lights so you can see all of the cobwebs and dust more easily. For more detailed cleaning, use a long, extending duster to work your way around the fixture. Make sure to cover the chain and bulb as well as the outside of the fixture to get rid of any cobwebs hiding on the inside."

Start in the farthest corner and vacuum your way out of the room, as you would with mopping. Sprinkle carpets with a little baking soda before you start vacuuming to take care of any unpleasant odors. Don\u2019t forget to vacuum the tops of the baseboard--this area can collect a lot of dust."

First, make sure you've dusted the furniture with a slightly damp cloth or vacuum with a dusting brush attachment, then apply polish to the furniture with a soft cloth. You can either buy furniture polish or make your own as a cheaper alternative. Remember to buy or make the correct polish for the material and finish of your furniture. Try out a patch test before polishing the entire piece. For wooden furniture, mix four parts olive oil and one part white vinegar. Put the solution in a spray bottle and make sure to test it first on your wooden furniture to see if it achieves the desired effect. Spray the solution onto the furniture and work it in until the wood shines. The vinegar also acts as a cleaning agent so you can clean and polish your furniture at the same time."

If the carpet is especially soiled, a professional service is probably best, but if it just needs some spot-treating, you can easily do that yourself. Shampooing your carpet will make it last longer and keep it in good condition. If you choose to rent a machine and do it yourself, remember to vacuum the carpet extremely well beforehand. Work with the machine as you would with a vacuum. Divide the carpet into sections and clean each one slowly and carefully with a side-to-side pattern, overlapping your strokes a bit. Don't work in circles or at random, otherwise you will lose your place and end up stepping on areas you already cleaned. After the carpets are finished, lay down towels in areas that get a lot of traffic. This will help them dry faster and keep them clean longer."
