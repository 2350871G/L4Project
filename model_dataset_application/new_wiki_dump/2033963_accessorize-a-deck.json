          "description":"A good rule of thumb is to provide enough seating for your minimum expected number of regular guests. That way, you can make sure that you have plenty of perches for everyone who feels like taking a load off. If space is a concern, consider going with a foldable, stackable, or collapsible style that you can put away easily after everyone goes home. Buying your patio furniture in sets can help you save a few dollars. In many cases, a pack of identical chairs costs less than one or two individual chairs in different styles.Tip: In a pinch, you can also simply relocate a few chairs from inside your home to your deck to make sure everyone has a place to sit."

A good set of modular patio furniture will make it possible to set up your pieces in a way that allows you to make the best use of your entertaining space. Keep an eye out for tables, chairs, and benches with built-in storage compartments, which will also help you keep the clutter on your deck to a minimum.

Cheaper furniture, by contrast, tends to break down quickly, forcing you to spend money on repairs or replacements\u2014money which will add up over time. Budget furniture is also typically less attractive and comfortable than items with higher price points, since it\u2019s often thrown together in a hurry using cheap materials."

Situate your selections in areas that look a little sparse, such as in corners and in between items of furniture, to accentuate your existing decor and make the most of your available space. Plants that produce lush foliage throughout the warmer months, like bacopa, petunias, and sweet potato vine, will provide the longest-lasting beauty. If you're not sure what will look best where, start with 4-5 small plants and space them out around your deck to keep them from looking too busy. You can then add more as needed to fill in any conspicuous gaps."

Arrange these containers into clusters around the focal points of your deck. Careful grouping will maximize space and create the illusion that your plants are larger and fuller than they really are. Check for a number on the product label or the container itself to find out its specific size. A #1 pot, for example, holds 1 gallon (3.8 L). Position the biggest containers in the back, with the smaller containers up front or off to one side. That way, everything will be plainly visible and your visitors will be able to take in the entire scene with a glance."

For more of a subdued look, opt for flowers with cooler colors, such as purple petunias or towering blue salvias. Choose shades that compliment the colors of your home. Blues, greens, and violets harmonize well with homes with cool-colored paint jobs. Similarly, warmer plants will pair up perfectly with yellow, dusty orange, or deep red exteriors."
