          "description":"If you want a classic bachelor pad aesthetic, opt for chairs and couches made with either black or brown leather. Otherwise, pick fabrics that have neutral tones, such as beige, grey, or brown, to help keep your place feel open and relaxing. Make sure you get furniture that fits well in your space and looks aesthetically pleasing so your bachelor pad doesn\u2019t feel too cramped. Try to keep at least 1 couch and 1\u20132 chairs in the main living area of your bachelor pad so you have room for multiple guests. Look for matching furniture sets if you\u2019re able to so your room feels more cohesive. Check local online markets, like Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace, to look for furniture if you\u2019re on a budget. Many people post and sell their older furniture when they buy something new. Avoid using outdoor furniture or seating that has bright and annoying patterns since it could make your place seem less refined.Tip: Bachelor pads tend to have a minimalistic feel, so avoid getting ornate pieces of furniture. Instead, get items that have long straight lines and single colors."

Make sure the tables are within reach of your furniture so you\u2019re able to use them when you need to. Side tables also make great places to put lamps and other small decorations to make your bachelor pad feel homier. Some coffee tables also have hidden storage options where you can keep blankets, movies, or games so they\u2019re out of sight."

Otherwise, opt for smaller rugs that you can fit underneath a table or accent piece. Rugs look great underneath large pieces of furniture or right inside your entryway. You may also get bath mats for your bathroom so you\u2019re able to dry off your feet when you get out of the shower. Don\u2019t use regular rugs since they may not be able to handle water as well. Keep live plants throughout your home to give it a fresh touch. Opt for low-maintenance plants, such as succulents, ficus, pothos, and rubber plants so you don\u2019t have to worry about them as much as more demanding species. Keep the plants in decorative pots or planters and use them as centerpieces on tables or as window dressing. Make sure to water the plants when the growing medium feels dry so they continue to grow and stay healthy. Try growing rabbit\u2019s ear, spider plant, peace lilies, and bamboo for more low-maintenance plants. You may also try growing herbs or vegetables in your kitchen window so you have fresh plants to use while you\u2019re cooking. Avoid buying plants that require constant trimming or pruning since they require a lot of upkeep. Get game tables or board games if you plan on entertaining others. If you have the space, try to find a ping pong or pool table that you can keep in your space so you can play with your guests. If you don\u2019t have the room or budget for a large game table, try buying board games that you can keep on a shelf or in a closet so you have more options for fun things to do at home. Try using a dartboard if you want a game that doesn\u2019t take a lot of space. Make sure the darts don\u2019t damage the wall where you hang it.",
