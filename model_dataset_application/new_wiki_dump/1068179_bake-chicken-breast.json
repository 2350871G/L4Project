If you're using any seasoning, sprinkle it on both sides of the chicken now. For example, you could add something like garlic and dried basil or a cajun seasoning mix.

          "description":"Lining with foil will make for easy cleanup. Place the chicken in a baking dish. If you're cooking more than one chicken breast, keep them slightly apart. You do not want them to touch. You can also add something like lemon slices or wedges to add extra flavoring to your chicken. If using skinless chicken, cover the baking dish with parchment paper. Take one sheet of parchment paper and cover one side with butter. Lay it on top of the chicken. Then, tuck the edges of the parchment paper underneath the breast to keep the chicken fully covered. The parchment will act almost like the chicken skin helping it to remain moist and keeping it from drying out.

Alex Hong\t\t\tExecutive Chef & Restaurant Owner\t\t\t\tWhat Our Expert Does: \"I like to cook the chicken in a cast-iron skillet for a few minutes before baking it in a dish in the oven. Using a cast-iron skillet gets the skin really crispy, and the meat soaks up all the flavors of the skillet! After that's done, I'll put it in the oven to bake with butter and herbs. It's a perfect dish every time.\""
