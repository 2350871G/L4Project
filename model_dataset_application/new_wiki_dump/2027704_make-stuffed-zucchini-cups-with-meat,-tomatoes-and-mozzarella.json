  "text":" Preparing the Meat Filling Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F/180\u00b0C. Spray the baking sheet with cooking oil spray, or line with aluminum foil/parchment paper. Saut\u00e9 the onion and green pepper in 2 teaspoons of olive oil in a non-stick skillet. Saut\u00e9 for about 4 minutes, or until the ingredients begin to soften. Add the minced garlic. Saut\u00e9 the ingredients for another minute. Transfer the onions, peppers and garlic to a bowl.  Pour the remaining 2 teaspoons of olive oil in the pan. Reposition it on the heat. Crumble the ground beef or pork and the ground turkey into the pan.  Stir the meat over medium heat until the meat is well browned.  Drain any excess fat from the pan by transferring the meat into a colander set in your sink. Put some newspaper or paper towels under the colander to catch the oil, then dispose of it in the garbage (do not pour oil into your sink drain, it's bad for septic tanks an sewer systems). Once the fat has drained off, return the meat to the pan.  Add the sauteed onions, peppers, garlic and the tomato sauce to the meat.  Stir all the ingredients together until well combined.  Simmer for 10 minutes on low heat.  Remove the pan from the burner. Allow the meat mixture to cool to room temperature. Stuffing the Zucchini Cups Cut each zucchini into 2 inch/5cm columns, discarding the ends.  Use a melon baller to spoon out the zucchini flesh from each slice. Leave about 1/4\"/6.35mm of the zucchini flesh in the bottom and on the sides of each \u201ccup.\u201d Arrange each zucchini cup on the baking sheet. Face the open end up. Mix 1 1/2 cups of the shredded mozzarella cheese into the cooled meat and vegetable mixture.  Spoon the meat and cheese mixture into the zucchini cups.  Baking the Zucchini Cups Bake the zucchini cups for 20 minutes.  Remove the baking sheet from your oven after 20 minutes and top each of the zucchini cups with the remaining shredded cheese.  Return the baking sheet to the oven. Bake for another 15 minutes. Test for doneness by piercing one of the zucchini cups with a fork or the tip of a sharp knife. If the flesh gives a little and feels soft, and the cheese is lightly browned, the zucchini cups are finished baking. Serving the Zucchini Cups Transfer the zucchini cups to a platter.
