Any items that have major damage like tears and holes probably won\u2019t sell at the garage sale. Consider donating them or placing them in a box labeled \u201cFree\u201d at your garage sale.

Don\u2019t put the shirt or blouse on the hanger by sticking it through the neck hole because that can stretch it out. People are less likely to purchase a shirt or blouse from your garage sale if it\u2019s stretched or warped."

          "description":"Oxfords, polos, and other dress shirts with buttons need to have the button below the top button secured. This will keep the shirt from sliding or falling off of the hanger. When people sift through the clothes hanging up, you\u2019ll want the button-up shirts to stay secure on the hangers."

          "description":"Use hangers with clips for shorts and pants so they\u2019re easily visible when you hang them at your garage sale. Secure them to the hanger by clipping them along the waistband. If the skirt, shorts, or pants have a larger waistband than the length of the hanger, fold them in half and clip the waistband. Place a piece of a napkin or tissue paper between the clips and the item to protect embellishments like embroidery or beading.Tip: If you don\u2019t have hangers with clips on them, fold the skirt, pants, or shorts over the central bar of the hanger."

          "description":"You don\u2019t need to use special baby-sized hangers that hold baby outfits together. Instead, use clothespins to attach pants, shorts, and skirts to their corresponding onesies or shirts on the hangers. You can pin the pants to the bottom of the shirt or to the hanger itself so they hang just below the shirt."

          "headline":"Price each item appropriately.",
          "description":"Your clothing needs to be priced well enough for people to want to buy the used items. You can label each item with a price or you can price sections of clothes. Clothes made by a well-known and quality name brand should still be priced reasonably so people are more likely to buy them. For example, you could say that all pants are $4. Baby clothes in good condition should be priced between $1 and $3, while adult clothes with little wear and tear should be priced between $3 and $5. If the clothes are really out of style, reduce the price so people are more likely to buy them and take them off your hands. Sell clothes that are older and worn but don\u2019t have any damage for $1 to encourage people to purchase them."

You can find clothing racks at department stores and online.Tip: If you don\u2019t have a clothing rack, try making one yourself! String a clothesline across a dresser that you can hang the clothes from. Try standing up 2 ladders and run a PVC pipe or a rod across the rungs of both ladders to create a rack.

Hang similar items near each other for people who want to search for specific types of clothes. Similarly,  keeping whole outfits or a set of clothing together can make it easier for people to take home the whole set. Place them together on a hanger or keep them nearby so they\u2019re visible. Arrange sections of similar clothing types by alternating colors to break them up visually. For example, hang a pair of blue shorts next to a pair of white shorts rather than another pair of blue.
