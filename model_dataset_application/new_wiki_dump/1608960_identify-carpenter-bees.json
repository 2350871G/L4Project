Female carpenter bees do have a stinger but have a docile temperament. Unless directly handled, female bees will not often sting. Because female carpenter bees burrow into the wood, you will mostly come in contact with male bees."

While a bumblebee's will be covered in small hairs, carpenter bee abdomens are hairless. Carpenter bee abdomens are black, but a bumblebee's abdomen will usually have yellow markings.

Scott McCombe\t\t\tPest Control Specialist\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: Carpenter bees are robust bees with a shiny black thorax, and they resemble large bumblebees. Males of the species will hover in front of nest sites to protect their mate, and they will quickly fly at and chase insects and competing carpenter bees to chase them off. They may even fly at and bump into people who get too close."
