  "text":" Prepare the Dough Pour the egg and the milk into a bowl and whisk them together until they are well combined.  Add the currants to the egg and milk mixture.  Combine the flour, sugar, nutmeg, baking powder, baking soda and kosher salt in a large bowl. Stir these dry ingredients a few times with a wooden spoon to combine them. Position a sifter or sieve over another clean bowl. Scoop 1 cup of the dry mixture into the sifter or sieve. Turn the handle of the sifter or tap the sieve until the dry ingredients pass through the mesh and into the bowl. Continue sifting the dry ingredients 1 cup at a time until all of them have been sifted together. Grate the frozen sticks of butter using the largest holes on a box grater. Make sure to place a plate beneath the grater to catch the frozen butter pieces. Add the grated butter to the bowl with the sifted dry ingredients. Using clean hands, mix the butter pieces into the flour mixture until the dry ingredients begin to resemble coarse crumbs. Pour the egg, milk and currant mixture over the flour and butter mixture. Mix the ingredients well using a wooden spoon. Shape the dough into a flat disc. Wrap the disc in plastic wrap and chill it for 1 hour in the refrigerator. Prepare the Dough for Cooking Roll the chilled cookie dough into a layer that is about 3/8\" (10 millimeters) thick. Make sure that the dough is neither too thick nor too thin so that the cookies are cooked throughout without burning their surfaces. Place a thin layer of flour in the bottom of a shallow bowl.  Dip a round cookie cutter in the flour and press the cookie cutter into the dough.  Place the cut cookies on a cutting board.  Add a piece of wax paper on top of the first layer of cookies before adding a second layer of cookies.  Continue layering the cookies until you have cut out as many cookies as you can.  Group the leftover dough into a ball and roll it out again.  Cut out more cookies, using as much of the leftover dough as possible, and place the cookies onto the wax paper.  Cook the Cookies on the Griddle Heat a griddle to approximately 325\u00b0F (160\u00b0C). Spray the griddle with nonstick cooking spray. Place some of the cookies on the hot griddle, leaving 2\" (5 centimeters) of space around each cookie.  Flip the cookies with a spatula when they become shiny. Cook the cookies for less time on the second side, being very careful not to burn them. Fill a shallow bowl with a thin layer of granulated sugar.  When you remove each cookie from the griddle, use tongs to hold each one as you dredge each cookie in the sugar.  Place the dredged cookie on a wire rack to cool and repeat the dredging process with the remaining cookies.  Finished. ",
