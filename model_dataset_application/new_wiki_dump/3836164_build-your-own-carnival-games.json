      "description":"Most carnivals have a giant wheel with numbers. People tend to place a quarter on a number and spin a wheel, if the wheel lands on their number, they get all the quarters placed on the numbers. To make money on this game, ask for people to pay $1 and give them a quarter to place on a number. Start by taking a piece of paper and divide it up with the amount of numbers on the wheel, Keep it simple! Just use the wheel from the game of life or make a flat wheel and spin a pencil in the middle."
