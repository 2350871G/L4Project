You can plant the seed potatoes whole or cut them into pieces so each piece has a shoot. Plant each potato or shoot about 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.5 cm) deep with the shoot facing up. They should be spaced 12 to 18 inches (30.5 to 45 cm) apart. If you'd like to space the potatoes out in your garden to cover a large space, you should cut the seed potatoes into pieces. This will maximize your coverage."
