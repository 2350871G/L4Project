          "description":"Go with plain butter if you want to eat your crumpet the most popular way. Choose either salted or unsalted butter and apply it to the top of a warm crumpet so it melts into the dough. Sprinkle sea salt on top of the butter if you\u2019d like to add texture and crunch.Tip: For a tasty twist, use a flavored butter, like garlic butter or herb butter."

          "description":"Opt to eat your crumpets with cheese, which is packed with calcium and protein, if you want a healthier snack. Pick any cheese you\u2019d like, such as cheddar, Swiss, or Gouda. If you want the cheese to melt, put it on top of the crumpets, then place the whole thing in a toaster oven or microwave for a few seconds. You can also use a soft cheese, like goat cheese, which is easily spread on the crumpet."

          "description":"If you like the taste of yeast extract, which is a very salty, brown paste that\u2019s a byproduct of brewing beer, eat it on your crumpets. Spread it in a thin layer since it\u2019s highly concentrated and has an intense flavor, so a little goes a long way. If you\u2019ve never had yeast extract, think of its taste as similar to soy sauce. Two popular brands of yeast extract are Marmite and Vegemite."

Leave the yolk runny so that when you cut or bite into it, the crumpet will soak up the egg. If you want more protein or flavor, sprinkle bacon bits on top or serve the crumpets with baked beans. You can also use additional toppings with the eggs, like fresh herbs, shredded cheese, or Hollandaise sauce."

Use the crumpet as the base, then smear tomato or white sauce on top and sprinkle with your favorite cheese. Place the pizza in the microwave or oven just until the cheese melts. If you\u2019re using the oven, start with 10 minutes at 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C). If you use the microwave, try 30 seconds to 1 minute. Use any toppings or sauces you like on a traditional pizza. For example, you can add pepperoni, chopped onions or green peppers, ham, or oregano."

You can buy clotted cream from a grocery store or make it yourself by straining cream through a coffee filter in the refrigerator."

Pour on as much or as little as you\u2019d like. If you don\u2019t have golden syrup, you can also use maple syrup. It doesn\u2019t have the exact same flavor but it\u2019s similar and does have the same texture.Tip: You may want to eat your crumpets with a fork and knife if you use a lot of syrup or honey since the crumpets will get messy and soggy!"

Then, top it with assorted berries and fruits, such as blueberries, strawberries, or sliced bananas. For added protein, choose Greek yogurt, which can have up to twice as much protein as regular yogurt. If you want to cut down on sugar, opt for a plain, unsweetened yogurt."

If you want to put toppings between a crumpet, like if you want to make a breakfast sandwich with eggs and cheese, use 2 crumpets rather than split one."

Steep a single cup if it\u2019s just for you or make a whole pot if you\u2019re feeding a group. You can brew tea using store-bought tea bags or loose tea leaves. Choose any type you\u2019d like, such as Earl Grey or green tea.Tip: Look on the tea bag to find the steeping time for your specific type and quantity.
