Most people use butter or oil to keep the mushrooms from sticking, but mushrooms do release oil when cooked. If you want, you can do what's called a dry saut\u00e9. In a dry saut\u00e9, you would just add your mushrooms to the skillet without any oil. Saut\u00e9ing mushrooms dry can produce a more roasted flavor. It also lowers the fat and calorie content.

Vanna Tran, an experienced cook, says: \"Mushrooms have a lot of flavor by themselves, but a little bit of salt can help bring out more of their natural flavor. For more of an Asian flare, though, add soy sauce, mirin, and white pepper. For a savory dish, grab some thyme!\""
