          "headline":"Opt for a vase with an hourglass shape for single bouquets of flowers.",
          "description":"This kind of vase should be round at the bottom and narrower at the neck, with a flared opening at the top. The narrowness of the neck is important because it helps keep the flowers together, making the arrangement look coherent and complete. If you have more than one bouquet of flowers, an hourglass vase might not be the best option\u2013 you'll have a hard time fitting a larger quantity of flowers through the vase's narrow neck."

        {
          "headline":"Choose a large, wide-mouth vase if you have multiple bouquets.",
          "description":"If you have a lot of flowers, then you may have enough to fill a wide-mouth vase. In that case, it's the best option, since you don't want to crowd your flowers in a smaller vase. Alternatively, split a group of bouquets up into smaller bunches and place them in multiple vases."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Pick a tall cylinder vase for tulips and other drooping flowers.",
          "description":"Tulips need some support, so opt for a vase that will support at least 2/3 of the height of the tulips after you cut them to the size you want. Then, the blooms can hang over the edge at the top of the vase, creating an artistic, draped look. If you need a bit of structure, group some in the middle together with a rubber band. The rest of the blooms can droop gently over the vase's edge. Other flowers that work well in tall cylinder vases include irises and hyacinths."

        {
          "headline":"Try a low cube for flowers that have stiff stems.",
          "description":"Roses and other similar flowers with stiff stems, such as sunflowers, do well in small, low, cube-shaped vases. Because the stem supports the flower well, it's easy to create a cohesive arrangement without a lot of support from the vase. Criss-crossing the stems across the middle of the cube will create a pretty, dome-shaped arrangement."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Go for a small bud vase if you only have a few flowers.",
          "description":"These diminutive vases work well for smaller buds. They are also a great way to show off flowers that are unique and striking\u2013 they can stand alone without additional accent flowers. For instance, a delphinium is an unusual flower that stands well on its own. You could also try small roses or daffodils. For small flowers with short stems, like rosebuds, lavender, and wildflowers, try using a teacup!"

If you pull the rubber band down so that it sits at the water line, you won't be able to see it at all. If you don't have a clear hair tie, pick something green to hold your flowers together, such as a rubber band or twist tie."

Then, place another few strips of tape perpendicular to the first set, forming a grid with small squares where you'll place the stems. This grid will keep your flowers from falling over, helping you create an attractive, dome-shaped arrangement. Try waterproof floral tape or thin office tape. You can even cut office tape in half to make it thinner."

          "headline":"Use tree branches to support your flowers.",
          "description":"You can use tree branches as backing for your arrangement if you plan to place the arrangement against a wall or on a shelf. If your flower arrangement will be visible from all sides, tie a few branches together with a clear tie and place them in the middle of your vase to create a central support for your bouquet. This way, the branches will offer structure to your floral display, but they won't be as visually distracting as a wall of branches arranged at the back of your vase. Lean the flowers against the branches, which will help hold them up. You can even use floral tape or clear rubber bands to attach your blooms to the branches."

The main purpose of these packets is to keep bacteria out of the water, and bleach will serve a similar function. Make sure to only add a couple of drops. If you add too much, you could kill the flowers, too. Another option is to add a few drops of vodka to kill off bacteria, as well as a sprinkling of white sugar to feed the flowers."

Hold the stems up to the vase and snip off the leaves that would be submerged underwater; if you don't cut these leaves off, they could rot and cause your flowers to prematurely die. Divide the fillers by size so you can begin with the biggest ones. The showy flowers can be any size, color, or variety, as long as they're the ones you want to display most prominently. Check for any rotten flowers and dead leaves, and be sure to remove them before placing your flowers in the vase."

          "description":"When cutting each stem, decide what height you want it to be by holding it up to the vase. Then, cut the stem at a 45-degree angle. Doing so provides more surface area for the flower to absorb water. Using sharp knives or clippers instead of scissors will give you a cleaner cut, making it easier for the flower to absorb water. Scissors may crush your flower stems, so avoid using them whenever possible. You don't need to cut all the flowers at once. In fact, you may want to cut as you go along so you can see the height you want for each stem as you arrange your flowers."

Place the first stem in the vase so the bottom of the stem sits on the opposite side of the vase from where the bloom emerges at the top. When you add the next flower, place it next to the first one, crossing the second stem diagonally over the first.Turn the vase as you add more flowers, laying each stem diagonally over the previous one. If your flowers are clustered together on stems, cut off the smaller flowers on the smaller stems.
