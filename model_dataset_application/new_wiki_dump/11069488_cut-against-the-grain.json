          "description":"The grain refers to the direction that the muscle fibers are aligned and is easier to identify in some of the tougher cuts of meat like flank and hanger steaks, and more difficult in lean cuts like filet and tenderloins. Look for the small striations of muscle fibers that run parallel to each other down the length of the meat to identify the direction of the grain. Chicken muscles fibers are tightly bound, but you can still see the striations of the fibers if you look closely."

To keep the meat fresh, tender, and juicy, cook it and slice it just before you serve it. Cook the meat however you prefer, but make sure it\u2019s fully cooked before you cut it. You can cut raw meat against the grain as well. For example, tougher cuts like brisket or large pieces of flank steak can be cut in half to make it easier to cook. If you\u2019re making beef jerky, cut the meat into thin slices while it\u2019s raw."

Depending on the type and cut of meat and how it was cooked, the time you need to allow the meat to rest can vary. Resting the meat also allows it to cool down a bit, making it easier to handle when you cut it.Tip: Larger cuts of meat, like a roast, needs to rest for 20 minutes. Chicken, steaks, or chops should rest for at least 5 minutes. A good rule of thumb is 1 minute of resting time for every 100 grams of meat."

Take a honing rod, place one side of the knife blade against the rod at an angle, and pull the blade towards you in a gentle and fluid motion. Repeat the motion 4-5 times, then do it again on the other side of the knife blade. Use a normal or straight back blade, not a serrated knife. Serrated knives will tear the muscle fibers apart and won\u2019t slice through the meat cleanly. You can use a larger chef\u2019s knife or a smaller paring knife, whatever feels more comfortable for you to use. The blade of the knife needs to be long enough to cut through the meat.
