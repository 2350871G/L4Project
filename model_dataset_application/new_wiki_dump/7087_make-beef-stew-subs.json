Have the flour in a shaker bag (a brown lunch bag will work) or have an area set up to roll the stew meat in the flour. If you are using black ground pepper, it can be added in with the flour and the garlic powder. Have all the cans opened and set aside and prep the eggs so that they're ready to be dipped in the meat.
