  "text":" Making the Friend Grab a washable marker or tattoo pen. If you have neither, you could use a Sharpie or permanent marker or the like, but it is not advised. Think about how you'd like your friend to look. Will it be a male or a female? What color will its eyes and mouth be? Which hand will you use? Fold your selected hand into the correct position. Make a fist, then slide your thumb below the folded fingers. Draw the face onto your hand, keeping it in the fist-like form. Usually the eyes go on the pointer and pinky fingers, and the mouth is between the thumb and folded fingers. What to Do With Your Friend Name your friend. It can be named anything you'd like. Make your friend speak. Simply stretch your fingers and thumb apart (keeping the fingers folded, of course) and be its voice. Its vocabulary can be as limited as just its name or it can have a vocabulary equal to yours. Introduce your hand friend to your human friends. They might think it's a little silly at first, but with some time, they'll probably accept your hand friend. Make a chair for your friend. It can be as simple as a paper chair. Make other furniture for your friend. Make sure it's big enough!",
