          "description":"Whether you are painting a room or just decorating it, the amount of light in the room may affect what color looks best in it. Lighting may be affected by the size of the windows, the amount of artificial light, and the direction that the room is facing. Lavender, yellow, powder blue, orange, and bright pink are good for rooms with low lighting. Darker shades such as charcoal, dark blue, and brown work nicely in a room with plenty of lighting. North-facing rooms should have bright colors and jewel tones. East-facing rooms should feature oranges, reds, and yellows. West-facing rooms do best with neutrals. South-facing rooms do well with both dark and light colors. Cooler shades, such as blues and greens, may be better in bedrooms and offices whereas warm colors, like reds and yellows, may be better for living rooms and kitchens."

          "description":"Bold colors will appear more vibrant against a neutral backdrop. When adding color to your house, establish neutral base tones to emphasize and brighten your bold palette. Keep about 80% of the room in neutral colors with the other 20% being your bold colors. Some neutral colors include:\nWhite\nGray\nCream\nPale yellow\nTan\nBeige\nChocolate brown"

Some complementary colors schemes you may choose include:\nTurquoise and red\nRed and yellow\nGreen and pink\nOrange and pink\nTeal and copper\nLavender and yellow"

This will create depth without oversaturating the room with one particular hue. For example, if you want to add red to your room, find accents in scarlet, crimson, burgundy, maroon, and sienna."

          "headline":"Decide on a palette for each room.",
          "description":"When choosing colors, you may want to have different palettes for each room in the house. This will give you some variety when choosing colors, and it will allow you to pick colors for the individual function and design of each room. For example, you may decide to have a black, white, and red palette for your kitchen but a seafoam green, sandy brown, and yellow palette for your living room and a purple and gold color scheme for your bedroom. Consider which rooms can be seen from other rooms. Choose similar or complementary color palettes for rooms that open up into each other."

They are perfect for living rooms, bedrooms, and other sitting areas. If you decide to change the color later, you can easily switch them out. Try layering pillows with different patterns or shades of color. These will add a dynamic effect to your sofa or bed. For example, your bed might feature a beaded purple throw pillow, a lavender neck bolster, and two sham pillows with a floral violet pattern. A blanket can be draped over a chair, the back of a couch, or tucked away in a basket. You can match the blanket and the pillow as well. For example, you might have two dark red throw pillows on your coach with a crimson blanket folded on the back of the cushions."

Once the primer has dried, use a mini-foam roller to paint the back of the shelf. Wait six hours, and add another coat. Once it has dried, you can add gloss on top. You can paint each shelf a different shade of the same color to create a varied effect. Instead of painting, you can also wallpaper the inside shelves. Find a wallpaper in a unique print that suits your color choice. Measure the back of each shelf, and cut the wallpaper to size. Paste it on using wallpaper paste.
