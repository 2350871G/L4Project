Note the dimensions that the pattern provides for the completed size. The right size for you will likely differ from the typical size you would buy in a store. It is useful to use a highlighter to mark the corresponding numbers for the size you choose to knit throughout the entire pattern before you begin. This makes it much easier to follow the instructions according to your size. The size of the finished item is sometimes stated as the size \"after blocking.\" Blocking is a technique of shaping fabric, usually after washing. For instance, many sweaters are blocked by laying them out and patting them into place while they are still damp, then leaving them to dry."

Understanding Knitting Pattern Charts Choose a pattern with a chart if you\u2019re advanced. Avoid a knitting pattern that provides only charts without written instructions if you are just beginning to read patterns, as it takes some practice to read charts. You may choose a knitting pattern chart over written instructions if you are more of a visual person and prefer reading instructions from symbols rather than words. Follow the key for the chart. Read the key provided for a knitting pattern chart, which will tell you what each symbol in a square means. In general, the following symbols mean:\nBlank square: Knit a stitch (right side) / purl a stitch (wrong side)\nHorizontal line: Purl a stitch (right side) / knit a stitch (wrong side)\nDiagonal line: Knit two stitches together (a decrease)\nCircle: Yarn over Follow the chart to knit one row at a time. Read the chart from bottom to top. A right side (RS) row will be read from right to left, while a wrong side (WS) row will be read from left to right. If the bottom row of a chart has two blank squares, followed by two horizontal lines: Start row 1 (RS) by reading the row right to left, which would mean purl two stitches (p2) then knit two stitches (k2). If the row is wrong side (WS), it will be read left to write, meaning knit two stitches (k2) then purl two stitches (p2). The pattern will specify how to read each row based on the key and whether the row is right side or wrong side.",
