          "description":"Almost all spiders are harmless, but there are a few species with bites that require medical attention. If possible, check the egg sacs and any nearby spiders for characteristics of venomous species. Consider calling in a professional to deal with poisonous spiders. The various black widow species are distinguished by the red markings, usually in the shape of an hourglass, on their abdomen\u2019s underside. They spin funnel-shaped cobwebs, and their egg sacs are beige to yellow, smooth, round, and 1 to 1.25 centimetres (0.39 to 0.49 in) in diameter. Brown widows are venomous, but not as aggressive as black widows. The hourglass-shaped markings under their abdomen can be yellow or orange, and they have dark bands on their legs. Their egg sacs are also beige to yellow, but are covered with little silk spikes. Brown recluse spiders have long bodies and slender legs. They are distinguished by a dark, violin-shaped mark on their back, and unlike most spiders, they only have 6 eyes. Their webs are flat, patternless, and sheet-like, and their egg sacs are silky, somewhat rough and irregularly shaped, and average 1.5 centimetres (0.59 in) in diameter."

Among the poisonous species, brown recluse spiders are particularly difficult to control. Brown recluse spiders can go months without food or water. Since they\u2019re hunting spiders, they wander, hide, and are fast. Spiders that wait in their webs for prey are easier to control."
