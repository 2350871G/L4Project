You can use as many colors as you like, but choose at least 3. Bright colors will create a vibrant mandala, but you can also go with more subdued colors, such as pastels or neutral shades. For example, if you want a bright and colorful mandala, you could alternate between red, yellow, and orange yarn, or you could alternate between pink, blue, purple, green, red, and yellow yarn. If you want something more subdued, then you could try pastel shades, such as light pink, light blue, light yellow, and lavender, or alternate between tan, brown, and aqua."

For example, you could start with a 2-round circle of yellow, then do a 4-round circle of blue, then a 2-round circle of red. Creating the Mandala Foundation Crochet a magic ring. A magic ring is a standard way to start crocheting in the round. Begin with a slipknot and then loop the working yarn around your middle and index finger twice. Work a slipstitch into and around the edge of the looped yarn to secure the circle. Chain 3 and double crochet 11 times around the ring. Next, crochet a chain of 3. This will count as your first double crochet stitch. Then, double crochet into the circle 11 times for a total of 12 stitches in your first round. If desired, you may also single crochet the first round. This will just result in a slightly narrower first round. Chain 2 to start the round if you are using the single crochet stitch. You will add more stitches in every round and you can expand the circle as much as you like, so there is no need to start with a higher number than 12 stitches. That may result in a ruffled circle. Slipstitch to close the circle. When you reach the end of the round, work a slipstitch into the top of your chain of 3 (or 2 for single crochet). Insert the crochet hook into this chain and yarn over. Then, pull the yarn through the stitch. This will complete the first round. Double crochet into each stitch in the round 2 times. For the second round, you will need to work 2 double (or single) crochet stitches into each stitch in the round. Keep working stitches this way to the end of the round, and then slipstitch to end the round. If desired, you may also single crochet the second round for a slightly narrower round. Working Additional Rounds Switch colors and start a new round. Cut the working yarn of your last round about 6 inches (15 cm) from the last stitch. Then, tie the new yarn to the base of the yarn you just cut, so that it is close to the last stitch you worked. Use the desired stitch to crochet into the first stitch and start the new round. You can use either a decorative stitch or a simple stitch to work the new round. Determine when to work increases. Working increases will help to keep the mandala lying flat. To figure out how many times you need to work an increase per round, multiply the round number you are on by the number of stitches you worked in the first round. For example, if your first row had 12 stitches, then you would multiply 12 by 4 to get the number of stitches for the fourth round, which would be 48. That means that if your third round had 36 stitches total, then you would need to work 12 increases in the fourth round. Make sure to space out the increases instead of doing them all at once. For example, if you have 36 stitches and need to work 12 increases, then you would crochet twice into 1 stitch on every third stitch in the round. Continue working rounds and changing colors to complete your mandala. You may make your mandala as large or as small as you like. Smaller mandalas are great for coasters, while larger mandalas can be used as potholders or even decorative tablecloths. Keep working rounds until your mandala is the size you want it to be. Weave in the ends as you go. After you complete a round in a new color, weave in the tail of that yarn before switching to a new color. Use a yarn or tapestry needle to weave in the end. You can simply sew the end of the yarn into the last row of stitches you worked. Use the same technique to weave in the tail for the last round you work when you are ready to complete your mandala.
