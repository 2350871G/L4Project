          "description":"In a perfect world, your dog wouldn't touch, let alone consume, any of your garden plants. In the event that they do experiment with some of your backyard flora, though, you want to make sure that this accidental consumption is non-toxic. Opt for flowers that are wholly and safely edible for peace of mind. In contrast, avoid flowers such as foxgloves, rhododendron, azaleas, lily of the valley, and everything from the buttercup family.

          "description":"Growing delicious fruits and veggies in your garden is a great way to augment your diet with fresh produce. Make sure your healthy lifestyle change is safe for your dog by using only those plants which are safe for canine consumption. Among others, broccoli, celery, blueberries, pears, peaches, and apples are all safe options. Avoid allium vegetables, such as garlic onion, and shallots, as well as grapes, mushrooms, asparagus, and cherries, as these are toxic to dogs."

          "description":"Culinary herbs, such as oregano, thyme, rosemary, and parsley, are safe for your dog to consume. They also emit strong tastes and smells, so your dog is unlikely to find them appealing in any case. The same goes for aromatics, such as lavender and bee balm, so feel free to fill your garden with as much fragrant flora as you like."

          "headline":"Use nightshade vegetables with caution.",
          "description":"Potatoes, tomatoes, and eggplants are all safe for dog consumption, but, as members of the nightshade family, their foliage contains potentially harmful chemicals, such as solanine and tomatine. While it\u2019s unlikely your dog will sample these leafy parts, you should take special care when including these fruits and veggies in your garden. You can take special safety measures with these plants by erecting a pet-proof fence or planting them in elevated containers."

          "description":"Though particularly effective at exterminating unwanted garden pests, chemical pesticides such as metaldehyde are dangerous for dogs. Rather than using these harmful solutions, opt for natural, oil-based solutions that will help repel and control pesticide populations without presenting a hazard to your dog\u2019s health. You can also make a non-toxic, homemade pest repellent by mixing \u00bd cup liquid dishwashing soap, two tablespoons ammonia, and five to seven cups of water."

          "description":"While fertilizers and mulches can provide essential boosts to your garden\u2019s growth, they often contain toxic chemicals and additives. Read the labels of all products you purchase to make sure they\u2019re pet-safe and all-natural. No matter what, though, keep your dog away from fertilizer while it\u2019s fresh, as organic blends contain appealing ingredients, such as fish byproducts and blood meal. Ingesting small quantities won\u2019t harm your dog, but overdoing it can cause stomach upset. Cocoa mulch is lethal to dogs when ingested, so avoid it at all costs. Instead, opt for root mulch or pine bark mulch."

Pour distilled white or apple cider vinegar from your kitchen into a spray bottle and give your plants a good dousing every couple of weeks. As an added bonus, the vinegar will also dissuade aphids, squash bugs, and other insects. If you live in an area with lots of other wildlife, be sure not to use deer or rabbit repellents which contain coyote urine. This will attract your dog rather than repelling it."

Some gardeners also recommend using orange peels as a natural dog deterrent."

You can use a wooden or metal garden fence from a home improvement supply store, or you can plant a row of prickly plants, such as rose bushes or holly branches, to keep curious canine snouts and paws away. Even a relatively low fence can be sufficient to dissuade dogs, as it creates a visual barrier between them and the off-limits flora. If your dog seems to get through any fence or thorny shrub, plant your sensitive items in raised beds or elevated containers."

This way, you\u2019re showing your dog what positive behaviors and activities he can do while in the garden, rather than just showing him what he can\u2019t do and where he can\u2019t go. Tennis balls, Kong cones filled with peanut butter, and hard rubber bones are all good options.

You can minimize this damage by creating a prescribed area in the garden where your dog can relieve itself. Use a driftwood stump or artificial post you\u2019ve purchased from a pet supply retailer.

If your dog loves to dig, give him a good place to indulge in this activity rather than simply discouraging him from digging everywhere in the garden. In order to protect your dog from heat stress, make sure the sandbox is out of direct sunlight, and periodically sprinkle the sand with water in order to cool it down."
