      "headline":"Capture a Riolu around Route 8.",
      "description":"Route 8 is a stretch of road between Lagoona Lake and Rosecove City. Walk in tall grassy patches to encounter Riolu. It's a low 3% encounter rate, so it might take you a bit to find one. Use a Luxury Ball to capture Riolu. These Pok\u00e9 balls are much more comfortable to the Pok\u00e9mon and will increase its happiness as well as increase future happiness-gaining activities. You can purchase a Luxury Pok\u00e9 Ball from the Pok\u00e9 Ball Emporium in the Shopping District of Anthian City."

      "headline":"Build your Riolu's happiness.",
      "description":"Riolu will only evolve into Lucario when its happiness meter is maxed. To check your Riolu's happiness meter, you'll have to go to the NPC in the small house where the second gym leader is (Brimber City). When he says, \u201cIt's extremely friendly toward you. It couldn't possibly love you more,\u201d then your Riolu's happiness meter is maxed, and your Riolu is ready to evolve. Walk with Riolu in your party. Give your Riolu a Soothe Bell to hold in battles, which has similar effects to the Luxury Ball. The Soothe Bell increases the number of happiness results from any happiness-increasing activity, like battling. You can get a Soothe Bell from Kevin Cat in the Skitty Lodge on Route 16. Winning Pok\u00e9mon battles will increase your Riolu's happiness level. As long as your Riolu doesn't faint, the win will increase its happiness."

      "headline":"Battle with your Riolu to level it during the daytime.",
      "description":"Once your Riolu's happiness is maxed, you need to level it once during the daytime before it can evolve. Try to seek out what is weak against your Riolu for battles. Riolu is a fighting-type Pok\u00e9mon and is strongest against normal-, ice-, steel-, and rock-types, like Rattata, Dewgong, Aron, and Golem. Fighting ice-type Pok\u00e9mon means your Riolu has a higher success rate, meaning you will gain experience faster. Avoid fighting Pok\u00e9mon that are strong against your Riolu. Riolu has a weakness against poison-, flying-, psychic-, bug-, and fairy Pok\u00e9mon like Arbok, Zubat, Natu, Ledyba, and Marill."

      "description":"Once Riolu has a full happiness meter and levels in the daytime, it will evolve automatically into Lucario."
