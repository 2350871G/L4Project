      "description":"Mark out a grid lightly in pencil to ensure you form well-aligned stars. The grid will have 9 rows and 11 columns. Then you can draw stars in alternate boxes. The sequence with the stars is 6 in the first row, 5 on the second, then 6, then 5, and so on. For the rows, measure the length of the canton and divide it by 9. The result of this will be the width or the thickness of each row. Likewise, measure the breadth of the canton and divide it by 11, so you can make equidistant columns in the grid. Make the guidelines on all four sides and draw the grid. Since this grid will need to be erased later, draw it very lightly."

    {
      "headline":"Draw the stars.",
      "description":"Draw five-pointed stars in alternate boxes of the grid. The sequence of the stars alternates between 6 and 5, beginning with 6 in the top row. To get the stars right, start with the pointed shape of the letter 'A' and make a smaller 'A' inside it so both the 'As' together form a partially triangular shape (you don't have to add the horizontal line inside either 'A'). Then make a straight horizontal line through the star towards the the top third of the shape. Bring a line down on each side to join the end of the horizontal line to the bottom point of the A on the opposite side. For other pointers that may help, check out How to Draw a Star. If you prefer, you can use stickers or a star-shaped stencil, or make a stencil with any thick paper like cardboard paper. Draw the star on it and cut the shape out. Use this cut-out to help you draw all the stars on the flag. Erase the grid once you make all the stars."

The background color of the canton is blue. Color the stars white, or leave them blank if your background was white. The color of the stripes alternate between red and white, beginning with red at the top and bottom of the flag."
