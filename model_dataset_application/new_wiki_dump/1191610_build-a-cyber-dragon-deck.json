      "headline":"Add supports.",
      "description":"Galaxy Soldier should be run at 3 to make Rank 5s, and so should Instant Fusion, which summons in Panzer Dragon. You can also run cards like Chronomaly Golden Jet and Solar Wind Jammer as Rank 5 material. If you run fusions, add 1 copy of Electromagnetic Turtle, since Rampage can send it from the Deck. A Kaiju engine is great to use with this deck, since Kaijus are good against the meta, and Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju gets bonus synergy points with the deck. Being a Light Machine, it can be searched with Repair Plant, and you can give it to your opponent then use it for Fortress Dragon. This would be 2 Interrupted Kaiju Slumber, 2 Jizukiru, and 1-2 other Kaijus, usually Gameciel. Brilliant Fusion also synergizes well, since Seraphinite is Level 5. The Brilliant Fusion engine is 3 Brilliant Fusion and 1 Gem-Knight Garnet. Optionally, you can run 1 Trick Clown or Electromagnetic Turtle as the Light monster to send to the Graveyard."
    },
    {
      "headline":"If you're running the Fusion variant, add Fusion Spells.",
      "description":"Cyber Dragon is perfectly capable of being run as a pure Xyz deck, relying on the powerful Cyber Dragon Infinity, since the Fusion Spells can be dead draws. If you want to OTK, however, Chimeratech Rampage Dragon is a lot of fun. The two best Fusion cards are Power Bond and Overload Fusion. With a bit of field clearing, Rampage should be able to OTK even without Power Bond."

Cyber Twin Dragon and Pair Cycroid are decent with Power Bond. Run Panzer Dragon for Instant Fusion and Gem-Knight Seraphinite with Brilliant Fusion. Sea Monster of Theseus can also be used with Instant Fusion, and it can make Vermilion Dragon Mech, Leo, Keeper of the Sacred Tree, and Ultimaya Tzolkin."

Get 2 each of Cyber Dragon Nova and Cyber Dragon Infinity, since Infinity is one of the best cards Cybers have access to and Nova is needed to summon it. Also add Constellar Pleiades, Artifact Durendal, and Volcasaurus. Magnaliger and Zemaioh are good Machine monsters to get past Drei's restriction. You can add Rank 4s if you have enough Level 4s, and Gaia Dragon, the Thunder Charger, and even Synchros with Theseus or the Ghost Girl handtraps."
