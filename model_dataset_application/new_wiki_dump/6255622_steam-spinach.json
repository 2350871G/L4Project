Place the spinach in a colander and run it under tap water until it's slightly damp. If you don't have a colander, you can simply add the spinach to a bowl and swish it around as you run water over it. Afterwards, you can pat the spinach dry with a clean paper towel. You don't need to get the spinach completely dry, but you should make sure it's not dripping wet."

You should not have to cram the spinach into the saucepan. A saucepan that's too small will cause your spinach to not cook evenly throughout. Set the saucepan over medium heat to cook your spinach.
