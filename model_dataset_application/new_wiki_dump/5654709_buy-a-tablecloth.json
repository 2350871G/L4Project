If so, you won't be wanting a delicate, hand-embroidered cloth but a strong, sturdy and colorfast tablecloth instead. If you are looking for a regular use tablecloth for the family dining table, then polyester is a great choice. It is normally stain-treated and washes easily. Is it just for special occasions? If so, it's okay to want the delicate, lacy and hand-embroidered tablecloth, provided you're aware that it may get stained and require special washing. For something fancier, maybe look for a Damask fabric\u2013\u2013these have beautiful patterns woven into the cloth."

However, some stains might be small enough that you can live with them. Tears or fraying: Look for small tears, fraying and loose threads. Consider whether they mar the overall appearance of the tablecloth or whether they're just part of its character. Missing embroidery: Unraveled or unfinished embroidery may cause the tablecloth to look incomplete or shabby. On the other hand, this may simply form part of its charm. Smells bad: Let the seller know it smells bad and see if you can get a price reduction as you're going to have to wash the item. If you can't get it for a good price or it really stinks, leave it be. However, even if you find any of these flaws, don't be too precious about it, as all old things have some wear and tear and if the stain or tear is small, barely noticeable or simply part of the nature of the item in a good way, then it may still be fine to use it. Also, you may be able to disguise some flaws, especially if the embroidery is worth salvaging. Ultimately, antique or vintage tablecloths are about adding charm and character to your home, so a few flaws are to be expected."
