Use 1 C (8 oz) of dishwasher detergent, \u00be C (6 oz) washing soda, and \u00bd C (4 oz) of vinegar for every 3 tablespoon (44.4 ml) of regular laundry detergent you use.

If the color is the only issue, and the pillow does not smell of mildew, mold, or sweat, you can simply place it in a pillowcase to hide its unsightly color.
