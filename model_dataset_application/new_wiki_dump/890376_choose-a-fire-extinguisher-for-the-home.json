      "description":"Is it going to be used in a garage, kitchen, vehicle, fireworks, brush piles, picnic, or just a general location in or around the house? This will help you determine the type and size of extinguishers required. Even in homes or other buildings with automatic fire-suppression systems, portable fire extinguishers add a layer of fire protection to be used when people are present. They are required in all types of buildings other than one- or two-family dwellings, under NFPA 1 (National Fire Code). State or local codes may adopt different or amended fire codes, and you may want to check whether there are specific requirements in your area. For example, a short-term rental unit might be considered a \"commercial use\" in your municipality, requiring extinguishers, among other safety provisions."

C - Electrical fires which includes any energized electrical objects. D - Combustible metals such as magnesium wheels or lithium batteries. K - Deep oils and greases found in a kitchen fire.

      "headline":"Choose extinguishers that are approved types for use on the classes of fires you are likely to encounter.",
      "description":"Some types of extinguishers may be used on multiple classes of fires; others may actually be dangerous to use on more than one particular class. All extinguishers act to cool or smother a fire, or to otherwise break the chemical chain-reaction that we call \"burning\". Extinguishers typically contain one or more solid or liquid chemicals to extinguish and another chemical gas as a propellant, or, in some cases, the gas propellant is also a gaseous extinguishing agent, such as CO2. Extinguisher types include: water (with or without anti-freeze), aqueous foam, dry chemical (as well as dry powder), wet chemical, carbon dioxide (CO2), and \"clean agents\", such as Halon\u00ae and similar chemicals that cool and smother a fire and then quickly evaporate. Regardless of the contents, national standards determine the required labeling of extinguishers for the classes of fires on which they may be safely used. A water-type extinguisher, for example, should only be  labeled for use on class A fires and not on B, C, D or K fires, which can be made worse with water. If you actually need a dry powder extinguisher for class D risks of burning metals, be sure to get professional advice to avoid selecting a type that may be ineffective for your particular purpose. Many extinguishers types can be used on multiple classes of fires, the most common being ABC. This shows a rating for use on class A, B, or C fires. Though they may have wide applicability, they can make quite a powdery mess, meaning another type may be more appropriate. For example, a CO2 extinguisher or \"clean agents\" may be a better choice for a fire involving expensive electronics or machinery. When an extinguisher has more than minimal capacity, the label will have a number indicating the rating for each classification, such as 2-A, 10-B. The higher the number, the more fire it will extinguish, at least under perfect conditions. For example, a 10B rating signifies the ability to put out a 10 square-foot puddle of flaming liquid. This is good to know, if you only have a 10B extinguisher and a 30B fire. Types C, D and K are not required to have any additional numbers."

      "description":"Some types of extinguishers may be hazardous to your health if misused or abused. A CO2 extinguisher puts out a jet of gas at over 100 degrees below zero. In the wrong hands, this could cause serious and instantaneous injuries. CO2 and many \"clean agents\" are also asphyxiants that can push the air (and its oxygen) out of a closed space, making it impossible for people and animals to breathe. A multi-purpose ABC extinguisher should not be placed near oxidizers such as pool chemicals. Only type A water extinguishers should be used there. Where a type K extinguisher is installed, occupants should know that it is intended for the deep fryer fire and not for the waste basket fire. A CO2 extinguisher may be used outdoors, but you should be aware that its effects can literally blow away and the fire may quickly rekindle once you run out of CO2."

      "headline":"Choose appropriately sized extinguishers.",

For example you may want a larger extinguisher in a garage which contains a large volume of flammable substances, whereas a smaller one may be appropriate for use in a small cooking fire. Remember that children may have difficulty using a heavier extinguisher. Rather than having one large extinguisher, consider having multiple smaller ones. That way, not only can you have a broader selection of types (if you choose), you may have a better chance that one of them will actually work, when pressed into service during an emergency."

Many are designed to be disposable, when they have lost their pressure through leakage, let alone actual usage."

You might also want to put up a sign or label to show visitors where the fire extinguishers are located, in case you're not present when they  are needed. It is also important to read and understand the necessary inspection, testing and maintenance steps for your extinguisher. Failure to maintain the extinguisher may result in it being inoperable when you most need it. According to the model code, a portable extinguisher that weighs more than 40 pounds (18.14 kg) should not be hung with its top more than 40 inches (1.08 m) above the floor."
