Most centrifugal juices can juice spinach or other greens, but they are not very efficient at doing so. Additionally, most centrifugal juicers cannot juice wheatgrass. If you plan use primarily juicy fruits and veggies, then a centrifugal juicer may be a great choice for you."

          "description":"Centrifugal juicers are very reasonably priced. This is the primary benefit of a centrifugal juicer (over the more high-end masticating juicers). Centrifugal juicers start for as little as $20, but they may run as expensive as $200. Higher end models can typically handle whole pieces of produce, and yield more juice. Look for a model that fits your budget."

          "headline":"Think about juicing speed.",
          "description":"Centrifugal juicers work fast. These speedy machines are excellent for preparing yourself a quick glass of fresh juice each morning. If juicing is something you plan to do often, and if you are short on time, a fast-moving centrifugal model may be right for you."

          "headline":"Look for easy cleaning.",
          "description":"The worst part about making juice is cleaning the juicer. Fortunately, with a centrifugal juicer (unlike with most masticating models), the cleaning can be easy! Look for a model that easily snaps apart and rinses clean with minimal effort. A good choice is the Hamilton Beach Big Mouth Juicer. Any of the Breville models are also notable easy to clean."

The noise produced by the average centrifugal juicer is on par with a typical blender, food processor, or coffee grinder. Fortunately, centrifugal juicers are much faster than other models, so your juicing time, noisy though it may be, will fly right by."

Sometimes called \u201ccold press\u201d or \u201cslow\u201d juicers, masticating juicers use a low rpm motor which best retains the nutritional value of your fruits, veggies, and greens."

However, something else to keep in mind when considering the price is the fact that a masticating juicer will give you more bang for your buck (or more juice for your carrot). If you use your juicer often enough, you will recuperate your money over time."

          "headline":"Store your juice longer.",
          "description":"Because of the low rpm process used by masticating juicers, very little heat is introduced into the juice. As a result, you can store your fresh juices for up to 48 hours, without losing any of the nutritional value. (Unlike juice produced by centrifugal models, which begins losing nutritional value right away.) This can be a huge perk, and in some ways makes up for the time lost on the slower juicing process."
