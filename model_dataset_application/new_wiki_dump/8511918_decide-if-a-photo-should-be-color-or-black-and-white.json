          "headline":"Use black and white for pictures with a strong subject.",
          "description":"The subject of any photo is the main object or the focus of interest. When the subject is clearly defined in a shot or isolated, black and white coloring can make it stand out. Images with simple backgrounds are ideal candidates for black and white shots. Subjects that are in the foreground can also benefit from black and white coloring, especially when the subject has sharp contrast. Backgrounds that appear miniature in scale due to distance will be minimized by black and white coloring, which naturally draws the eye to more dominant aspects of the composition. An empty sky surrounding a subject usually results in sharp contrast between the two. This can be ideal for black and white photography."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Capture landscape photos or those with a weak subject in color.",
          "description":"Color creates more gradient in photos, allowing you to distinguish subjects and points of interest in a shot more clearly. With landscape photos, photos with multiple points of interest, and photos with a weak or unclearly defined subject, color photography will add nuance and depth. Landscape shots often use a natural feature, like a tree or forest, a rock, a mountain, and so on, as the subject. These can lose clarity in black and white."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Utilize high contrast for black and white development.",
          "description":"Contrast is the difference between light and dark colors in a photo. Pictures that have colors that are thick and bold, with bright highlighted areas and dark shadows, are a good example of high contrast. High contrast photos usually work great in black and white. Pictures that include bright sunlight oftentimes also have high contrast. Consider pictures with strong, clear lighting for black and white development. Portraits with a face that is distinct from clothing also tend to have high contrast. Try these in black and white as well. Low contrast images can become flat when developed in black and white. These photos generally work best in color."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Highlight leading lines with black and white.",
          "description":"Leading lines naturally direct your eyes to a point in a photograph. This might be a person, object, or the vanishing point in the distance. When distinct and crisp, leading lines can take on a geometric appearance in black and white. Black and white images sometimes turn out flat. Leading lines add a sense of motion to the viewing of a shot, effectively combating flatness. Some common leading lines include: sidewalk crossing lines, lines formed by architecture (like the those formed by an archway), roads/paths, rows in crops, and more."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Display the shades of various hues in the sky with color.",
          "description":"Differences in the shades of blue of an open sky shot will be lost in black and white. The rich interplay of light on clouds or the portrayal of similar shades of the same color, common in sky shots, is most suited to color photography. Clouds that are poorly defined are also good candidates for color shots. The hazy quality of these can be too indistinct for black and white coloring."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Intensify contrast in cloud shots with black and white.",
          "description":"The pure white of clouds, especially those with a clearly defined shape, can look stunning in black and white. The contrast between the white of the clouds and surrounding features can add an element of drama. Shots that include different kinds of clouds, like tall, fluffy ones alongside flat, feathery ones, can add texture to black and white sky shots, creating a sense of depth."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Accentuate the darkness of shadows with black and white.",
          "description":"Although not always the case, shadows can sometimes be an obstacle for color photography. These same shadows, however, are an asset in black and white. Photos taken early or late in the day will yield long shadows, which can be used to frame a subject, adding interest to the shot. Too many shadows can overload color photography, distracting attention from the subject. In these kinds of shots, try black and white. The interplay of light on dust in a shadowed scene can have a dramatic or whimsical effect on your shots."

          "description":"If the goal of your photography is to candidly catch character or essence, black and white can help bring out these features. Because of this, many travel and street photographers choose to develop their shots in black and white. The crisp effect black and white coloring has on lines is great for highlighting striking facial features."

          "headline":"Reduce confusion in the composition.",
          "description":"Shots that are cluttered with distractions can lack focus. Color can make this even worse. Color can distract just as much as it can accentuate, so in busy pictures, black and white often simplifies the composition of a shot, clarifying the subject. With distractions minimized by black and white color, the eyes of those viewing your picture will be more readily drawn to the subject. Some items that might steal attention from the subject of your shot include things like colorful containers, draperies, art, articles of clothing, and so on. Remove these distractions with black and white coloring."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Create a dramatic, antique, or dark atmosphere.",
          "description":"The stark nature of black and white coloring can evoke an emotional, moving quality to shots. Black and white photos also often remind people of bygone days. These can be powerful influences on the atmosphere of your shot. Because of its association with antique photos, even ordinary items can take on an antique cast when shot in black and white. In some cases, black and white shots can evoke a brooding, moody, or dramatic quality. This works well for shots of old buildings."

When the color scheme is part of the essence of a place, use color. Some cities are characterized by certain colors. Red, for example, is a lucky color in Chinese culture and is frequently used in cities. Without color, this aspect would be lost."

          "description":"Color photography really shines when there is striking light. Oftentimes the most stunning lighting can be found an hour before sunset or soon after sunrise. The warm, golden rays shed by the sun at these times of day will enrich color shots. Scenes that seem cold and impersonal might benefit from better lighting. Visit a photo location shortly after sunrise or before sunset to make the most of this lighting. Storms or partly cloudy days can block or reveal the sun in interesting and evocative ways. You might want to keep your camera handy in these weather conditions."

          "description":"During dusk and early evening there will be a lot of natural color contrast between various light sources. The silver light of the moon and stars will interact with blue ambient lights and orange tungsten lights. These nuances will be lost in black and white. Shadows cast by ambient light can create interesting changes in natural color. For example, a shaded white uniform in the foreground of a shot might appear blue. The same white uniform under tungsten lights in the background would be warmer and have orange tones. Capturing the differences or alternations in lighting temperature can create interesting \u201chot and cold\u201d compositions. Generally, warm light has an orange or red quality to it. Cool light is comprised of blue and cyan tones."
