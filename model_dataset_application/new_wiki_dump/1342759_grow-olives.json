          "description":"Olive crops thrives best in climates with mild winters and long, dry summers. Suitable geographic areas, for example, include Europe's Mediterranean region and coastal valleys in the state of California. It is difficult, if not impossible, to grow olives in tropical climates. Frost will kill many olive trees if care is not taken. Temperatures that hit 22 \u00b0F (\u22126 \u00b0C) can harm small branches, while large branches and even whole trees can be killed if the temperature dips below 15 \u00b0F (\u22129 \u00b0C).Even if branches and trees survive the cold, the flavor of the olives and the resultant oil can be compromised by cold streaks. Avoid growing olives if you live in an area prone to these temperature dips. Olive trees do need a certain amount of cold, however. Proper flower development depends on the climate dipping to 45 \u00b0F (7 \u00b0C) or below, although this number alternates with olive tree varieties. This is why cultivation is extremely difficult in the tropics or very warm areas. Make sure that bloom season is fairly dry and moderate. Bloom season (April to June) should be fairly dry and not excessively warm. Olives are wind-pollinated, so wet conditions can hamper a tree's fruit set."

          "headline":"Check the pH of your soil and adjust it if necessary.",
          "description":"The soil should be moderately acidic or moderately basic, with a pH greater than 5 and less than 8.5. Many farmers believe 6.5 to be ideal. Get your soil tested at the Department of Agriculture or use a home testing kit from a department store. If the pH isn't in the right range, adjust it as necessary. Limestone is used to raise a soil's pH level, while sulfur is used to lower it. You can buy sulfur and limestone powder or pellet form, online or at a local greenhouse or hardware store. You adjust pH by spreading sulfur or limestone over your soil. The precise amount varies based on how much you need to adjust. You can read the instructions on your package. It may take a few days for limestone or sulfur to be adequately absorbed. For a more natural way of altering the soil's pH level, use sphagnum moss to raise pH and pine needles to lower it. Once your pH level is at the right level, keep monitoring it throughout the growing process, especially after using fertilizers which can affect pH level. You may have to adjust pH levels periodically as you grow your olive trees."

Do not plant in an area where the soil stands above ground during rainy periods. Also, dig a hole that's two feet deep and add water. If water steeps, opt for a different area. Planting your olive trees on a gentle slope can solve a lot of drainage problems. There tends to be better drainage on inclines."

The following year, they should be moved 24 inches away from the trunks. A second emitter should be added, also 24 inches away from the trunk. Installing dip emitter is complicated. While you can purchase them at a hardware store, installation is tricky unless you have extensive gardening experience. It is best to hire professionals to install your emitters. Usually, emitters are hooked up to a water source such as an outside faucet. You then run the tubing across your garden or yard until it gets to the base of your trees.

As a farmer, you want to strike a fine balance between letting your trees grow organically and protecting them from infestation and disease. In some cases, an insecticide is required to treat pest issues. Talk this over with a professional for the best results. Black scales are small black scales on the surface of the bark which can get out of hand fast as they produce eggs quickly. Although black scales primarily infest already diseased olive trees, healthy trees are not immune from attack. If discovered, treat black scale with the appropriate insecticide. Verticillium wilt may also affect olive trees, causing leaves and branches to unexpectedly wilt. Although certain cultivars of olives come equipped with resistance, there is yet no treatment for this fungal disease. If afflicted branches aren't cut off, wilt can affect the whole tree. In this case, you may have to prune branches even from very young trees. If you've had a problem with wilt in your soil before, avoid planting in that area."

The fertilizer's package should indicate appropriate amounts and where/how to apply the fertilizer, which is often sprinkles over the top soil. Err towards the lowest amounts possible. Fertilizer containers have ratios written on them, indicating the amount of things like nitrogen. Olive trees thrive with fertilizers with a 10-10-10 ratio or 13-13-13 ratio."

Many oils are a mix between green and ripe olives, harvested right when they are turning color. Decide on the type of olive you want and wait until your olives turn that color to harvest.
