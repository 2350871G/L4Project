Make sure that the foil goes all the way up the sides the pans so it can serve as handles to lift the cheesecake out when it's done baking. Crush some Oreos in a food processor. For the Oreo cheesecake bites, you'll need a 14.3 ounce (405 g) package of Oreos. Place 24 of the cookies in a food processor and grind them up into fine crumbs. If you don't have a food processor, you can place the cookies in a plastic bag and crush them with a rolling pin or other heavy object. Combine the butter and Oreo crumbs. When the Oreos are crumbled, add them to a large bowl. Mix in 5 tablespoons (71 g) of melted butter, and stir until they are fully combined. The easiest way to melt the butter is in the microwave. Place it in the microwave-safe bowl, and heat it in the 10 second intervals, stirring well after each. Continue heating the butter until is fully melted. Press the Oreo mixture into the baking dish. Once the Oreo crumbs and butter are combined, use clean hands to press it into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Make sure to press hard so the crust is firmly compacted. Bake the crust until set. When the crust is in the pan, place it in the preheated oven. Let the crust bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until it is just set. Be careful not to overbake the crust because it will bake further with the filling. Allow the crust to cool. When the crust is finished baking, remove the baking dish from the oven. Let the crust cool for about 15 minutes while you prepare the filling. Adding the Filling Lower the oven temperature. The filling doesn't need as high a temperature to bake as the crust does, so it's important to adjust the oven temperature. Lower it to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (165 degrees Celsius) so it can cool off while you prepare the filling. Cream the cream cheese and sugar until fluffy.

You can prepare the cheesecake the day before and freeze it overnight if you prefer. Coating the Bites with Chocolate Remove the cheesecake from the pan and cut it into squares. When the cheesecake is completely firm, remove it from the freezer. Lift it out of the baking dish using the foil on the sides, and use a sharp knife to cut the cheesecake into 36 bite-size squares. It helps to run the knife under hot water before you cut the cold cheesecake. Freeze the bites to firm them up. After you've cut the cheesecake into squares, place them on a platter. Cover it with plastic wrap, and return them to the freezer for 10 minutes to chill. Melt the chocolate in the microwave. To coat the cheesecake bites, you'll need 16 ounces (480 g) of chocolate. Place it in a microwave-safe bowl, and heat it at medium power for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir the mixture every 30 seconds, though, until the chocolate is completely melted and smooth. You can use any type of chocolate that you like to coat the bites, including milk, semisweet, or white chocolate. Line a cookie sheet. After you dip the bites, you'll need a spot to place them until they set. Use parchment paper to line a large cookie sheet so the bites won't stick even as the chocolate hardens. You can substitute a silicone baking mat for the parchment paper. Dip the squares into the chocolate one a time. When the chocolate is completely melted, use a fork to lower the squares into it one at a time. Move them around to ensure that they are coated on all sides, and lift out, allowing any excess to drip back into the bowl. Repeat until all of the squares are coated. When the bites are coated, set them down on the lined cookie sheet. Chill the bites until the chocolate is set. Once you've covered all of the Oreo cheesecake bites, place the cookie sheet in the refrigerator. Allow them to chill for 20 to 30 minutes or until the chocolate is fully set. Place the bites on a platter, and serve. Store any leftover cheesecake bites in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Finished. ",
