          "description":"If you\u2019re going for a classic look with a collared shirt, unfold the collar and drape the tie around its base. The wide end of the tie should drape down about 12 in (30 cm) below the thin end to begin with. The \u201cshow\u201d side of the tie should be facing out, and the side with the center seam should be against your chest. The wide side of the tie should be on the same side as your dominant hand. So, if you\u2019re right-handed, the wide side should be on the right side of your chest."

          "headline":"Loop the wide end over and around the narrow end.",
          "description":"Hold the wide side of the tie with your dominant hand and the thin side with your off hand. Lift the wide end away from your chest, then carry it across the front of the narrow end. Then, bring the wide end around and behind the narrow end. When you\u2019re done, the wide end should once again be on your dominant side, but the seam should be facing outward. This maneuver will create what\u2019s called a \u201cneck loop\u201d\u2014a V-shaped opening created by the tie just below the base of your neck."

          "description":"Start by lifting the wide end away from your chest again, then flip the tip of the wide end up towards your chin and insert it into the neck loop. Feed the rest of the wide side into the neck loop and apply gentle pressure to tighten the knot you just created at the bottom of the neck loop. After feeding the wide side through the neck loop, you\u2019ll once again end up with its seam facing outward on the dominant-hand side of your chest."

          "headline":"Feed the wide end up through the neck loop from behind.",
          "description":"Bring the tip of the wide end straight up behind the narrow end and through the neck loop. Once you\u2019ve pulled the entire wide end through the neck loop, let it drape down over the center of your chest. The \u201cshow\u201d side of the wide end of the tie should now be facing outward. To help form the pocket inside the knot for the next step of the process, you can extend the thumb of your off hand (which is holding the thin side of the tie) up into the knot at the base of the neck loop."

          "headline":"Tighten the tie around your collar and make final adjustments.",
          "description":"To tighten the tie, pull down on the narrow side with your off hand while pushing upward on the knot with your dominant hand. When the tie is as tight as you prefer, the wide side should completely conceal the narrow side of the tie. There\u2019s a good chance that you\u2019ll get the length wrong the first time\u2014or even the first few times!\u2014you try this knot. If the wide side of the tie is too short, undo the entire knot and start over, this time starting with the wide side longer and the thin side shorter. If the wide side ends up too long, start again and do the opposite. If your tie has a carrier loop on the seam side of its wide end, you can slide the narrow side through that loop to prevent it from \"peeking\" out from behind the wide side of the tie."
