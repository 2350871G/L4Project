          "description":"Glazes come in a variety of colors and consistencies. They can come in liquid or powder form and can be specially formulated for specific application methods. In other words, a dipping glaze is different from a glaze designed to be brushed or sponged onto your pot. You can buy pre-mixed glazes at your local pottery supplies store. If you are just starting out as a potter, you will probably want to begin by buying pre-mixed glazes. As you become more experienced with glazes, you might want to develop your own recipe based on how you want your pots to look and your favorite application method."

Wear gloves while working with your pot to prevent contaminating it with any lotions or soaps that might be on your hands. Be sure to work outside or in a well-ventilated area, and consider wearing a surgical mask as inhaling clay dust can be very bad for your lungs."

If you use a cloth or sponge, be sure to let it dry before moving on in the glazing process."

You can buy wax resist products at your local pottery store that can be brushed onto the bottom of your pot, or you can dip the item into a pan of wax. Allow 15 to 20 minutes for the wax to dry. If you don't want to use wax, you can wipe off any glaze that gets onto the bottom of your pot with a sponge or a metal scraper. Be sure to remove glaze from the foot of the pot, about one-quarter of an inch from the bottom, in case the glaze runs during firing."

The glaze will look slightly different dry than wet. Glazing the Inside of Your Pot Pour glaze into your pot. Slowly pour glaze into your pot, and swirl the item around to ensure complete coverage. Pour out excess glaze. You will probably have poured more into your pot than you need to coat the inside, so you can remove the rest. Touch up the interior of the pot. If there are any spots that the glaze did not reach in the pouring process, fill them in using a brush. You can remove excess glaze using a damp sponge or a paint scraper. Glazing the Outside of Your Pot Dip your pot into the glaze. If your item is small enough, pick it up with a pair of tongs and dip it straight into the bucket or vat of glaze until it is completely covered, remove it, and then clear excess glaze with a damp sponge, a brush, or a paint scraper. You can buy specialized glazing tongs at a pottery supply store. If your tongs leave marks on the pot, touch them up by brushing them with glaze once you remove your item. Pour on glaze. If your item is too large to dip into the glaze but small enough to hold over the bucket or vat, you can pour it over the outside of your pot.

You can add as many layers of glaze as you want, and mix up your colors as well as your brushing and sponging techniques to create unique designs. Finishing Up Remove any unwanted glaze. If you did not wax your pot, be sure to wipe any glaze off of the bottom with a sponge. If you did wax your pot, remove any glaze that has gotten onto the dried wax. Allow the pot to dry. No matter how many layers of glaze you've added, you have to wait for the final layer to dry thoroughly before firing your pottery. Fire your pot. Though you already fired it in the creation stage before you began the glazing process, you should fire it again once you are done.",
