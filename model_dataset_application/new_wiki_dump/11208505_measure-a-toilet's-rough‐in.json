Take it to your bathroom and find the flange on the floor by looking for a flat plastic or metal rim around the opening of a pipe on the ground. A flange covers the rim of your drainage pipe and is used to keep an airtight connection between the toilet and the drain."

If there is a baseboard or trim at the bottom of the wall, raise the hook until it is on the drywall. Hold the hook steady with your nondominant hand.Tip: If the flange is in the corner of a room, you may be confused by which wall is technically behind it. Look for the supply line for the water. It is a small knob sticking out of the wall 2\u201310 inches (5.1\u201325.4 cm) about the ground. The wall with this knob on it will be the back wall. If the wall is unfinished, stick the hook against the joist at the bottom of the wall."

Keep the hook still while you do this. Don\u2019t worry if it isn\u2019t perfectly straight.

The measurement should be 10, 12, or 14 inches (25.4, 30.5, or 35.6 cm) from the wall to the center of the flange. If your rough in isn\u2019t 10, 12, or 14 inches, you\u2019ll need to replace the current flange with an offset flange before you install your toilet. An offset flange can move the opening of the pipe from 11 inches to 10 or 12 inches, for example. Toilets that are designed for 10 or 14 inch rough ins tend to cost a little more. You typically find 10 and 14 inch clearances in older buildings."

  "text":" Measuring Clearance Behind the Toilet Get a measuring tape and find your drainpipe\u2019s flange. Get a retractable measuring tape with a flat metal hook at the end.
