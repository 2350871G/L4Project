          "description":"Lots of grout lines of smaller tiles can make small bathrooms look closed-in and cluttered. Larger tiles will have fewer grout lines that divide surface into boxes. Grout lines are the mortar-like mixture that's put between tiles to make the surface resistant to water."

          "headline":"Use different sized tiles in each part of the room to expand certain areas.",
          "description":"If you have a small space, layer most of the bathroom in larger tiles (like the floor and walls) and use smaller tiles for the shower area and/or backsplash. Choose the same colored tiles with similar sheen and texture. When it comes to size and textures for floors and backsplashes, smooth, large or medium-sized tiles are easier to wipe down."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Choose small tiles for slip-protection.",
          "description":"Smaller tiles are ideal for surfaces that are inevitably going to get wet like showers (and areas just outside of showers). The grout lines provide traction under your feet as opposed to large marble or shiny tiles with no surface variation. Large marble tiles provide the least traction and are best avoided in bathrooms that will be used by elderly persons."

          "headline":"Blend odd geometric shapes together to add artistic flare.",
          "description":"Combining a few different shapes together (like triangles, rhombuses, hexagons, octagons, and trapezoids) can look thoughtful and unique. Choose subtle hues or bold, contrasting colors to exacerbate the effect. Select a grout color that isn't too subtle or too shocking to highlight the shapes in a graceful way. You may want to have a professional contractor lay the tiles for you, as tiles cut or painted for geometric patterns can be difficult to lay correctly."

          "description":"Hexagonal tiles aren't very common, so putting them on a single accent wall will draw the eye to it. You can use all hexagonal tiles, but it won't have the same unique appeal as just using it on one wall. Choose a color and finish for the accent wall that are the same as the other tiles. For instance, if the floor and shower are lined in square, tan-colored granite, use the same color and type of granite for the hexagon-tiled area."

This shape looks great in alternating colors (like green or blue and black) or laid into a mosaic design. Place the peacock tiles inside of a simple border of square tiles to draw attention to the curved edges."

          "description":"Vinyl is extremely durable and easy to install. It's also one of the most cost-effective tiles. It's comfortable to walk on and provides some traction against slipping. You can cut vinyl into various shapes using a utility knife (and some cutting skills). If you want a stone look (without the hefty price), some manufacturers make stone-vinyl. You can also add a shiny and/or water-resistant finish to vinyl flooring."

Ceramic tiles can be easily customized with different colors and designs using a variety of glazes. Plus, it's easy to keep clean! If you live in a cold climate, it will be chilly on your feet! Ceramic tiles don't stand up to moisture as well, so avoid putting them in showers and bathtubs. Glossy finishing will keep the ceramic looking shiny and new. Ceramic tiles are a great option for a DIY project as you can easily cut the tiles using a tile cutter."

          "headline":"Use porcelain tiles for long-term durability.",
          "description":"Porcelain is extremely hard and, if it chips, the color will stay the same (as opposed to ceramic tiles that are a different color under the surface). It can also stand up to areas of high-moisture like showers and bathtubs because it won't absorb water. Durability comes at a price, as porcelain is more expensive than ceramic. Porcelain tiles are harder to cut and typically require professional installation."

        {
          "headline":"Choose natural stone tiles as an eco-friendly option.",
          "description":"Natural stone tiles add warmth to the room and can match any decor. They're also more slip-friendly, making stone a great option for homes with children or elderly people. Natural stones include marble, slate, granite, limestone, sandstone, and travertine. Stone tiles aren't as budget-friendly as other tile materials and can chip easily. Stone is naturally porous, so you'll have to regularly treat the tiles with a sealing agent to protect from stains or water damage."

          "headline":"Opt for glass tiles for a relaxing, spa-like environment.",
          "description":"Glass tiles look sleek and polished. Choose aquatic tones (light blues and greens) for a beachy feel and neutral hues for an elegant look. Glass is great for smaller bathrooms because it will help light bounce around the room. As a drawback, glass tiles show watermarks, streaks, smudges, and smears more than any other material. So be prepared to clean it often! Or, you can use smaller glass tiles to camouflage these minor imperfections. Glass tiles can be pricey\u2014but if you still want to have some glass elements, use them for accent designs on the backsplash or shower wall."

          "description":"Matte and/or mossy colored tiles typically come in a single color with varying splotches of lighter and darker hues. Opt for a neutral color that goes well with the color of your cabinets and fixtures. For instance, a dark green mossy-matte backsplash pairs well with dark cherrywood cabinets, a black countertop, and a silver or gold faucet. Matte finishes are easy to maintain and will disguise watermarks better than glossy tiles."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Keep your tiles looking new and shiny with a glossy finish.",
          "description":"Shiny tiles reflect light and can make your bathroom look larger (especially if there isn't a lot of natural light). A glossy finish is easy to wipe clean, but it will show water marks, footprints, soap smears, and dirt. A gloss finish provides little to no traction underfoot, so it can be a slip-hazard. Mimic the look of marble by adding a glossy finish to travertine stone."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Go for a trendy and/or edgy look with metallic tiles.",
          "description":"Metallic tiles will shine and reflect lots of light. Choose bright colors for a more playful look and darker hues for a romantic, bold esthetic. Smaller metallic tiles can add texture while medium-sized or larger tiles will exaggerate the reflective sheen. Select metallic colors that complement the decor and non-metallic aspects of the room. For instance, if your cabinets are dark brown wood, choose a burgundy-brown metallic tile for a cohesive look. You can also select a wild, clashing color to add some spunk (like hot pink or electric blue)."

          "description":"Crisp white, ivory, eggshell, or off-white hues reflect light, making the space look larger than it is. If you're tiling parts of the walls as well, light colors will reflect light and widen the space. Use bright white tiles for a contemporary look. In addition to making a space look larger, a bright, white bathroom looks refreshing and relaxing, especially with bathrooms that get lots of natural light. Complement the white color scheme with pops of neutral colors like blacks or grays. Add a few pops of blue, pink, red, green, or yellow for a little spunk. Add earth-toned accent tiles (like dandelion gold, burnt sienna, or sky blue) to mostly white bathrooms for a cottage-like feel."

          "headline":"Choose small tiles in up to 4 similar colors to create an eye-catching mosaic.",
          "description":"Working with smaller tiles allows you to play around with colors a little more. Select 1 to 4 shades of a single color to keep the eye moving and create a sense of depth. If you like blue, try using royal blue as your main color and adding details of navy and light or medium blue. Use a mix of caramel, chocolate, and/or walnut brown tiles for a romantic, lush look. Add some baby blue or tan accents to lighten it up a bit. If you want to create a unique, ultra-modern look, choose 2 or 3 similar colors and 1 accent color to add a playful spark (e.g., use mostly a forest green, a little true green, and accent certain areas with a few pops of bright orange or lilac). Avoid overly busy designs, as these can look cluttered. Instead, focus on creating patterns of light and dark by fading the colors into one another (like an ombre effect)."

          "description":"If you like to redecorate a lot, choose neutral colors that will work well with various wall colors, fixtures, and decor. For instance, off-white or black tiles will fit into any new color scheme much better than teals, blues, or yellows. Consider making a statement with white grout and black floors or vice-versa for a playful touch."

          "description":"Aquatic colors (light ocean blues, sea-foam greens, and light sandy browns) are calming and will make you feel like you're right on the beach! These soft hues pair well with silver fixtures and light or dark wooden cabinets. Avoid adding too many pastels into the mix, as this can look kitschy. Keep it simple and focus on only 2 or 3 pastels. Increase the beach-appeal by combining pastel tiles with a tan colored stone (like marble, granite, or travertine)."

          "description":"Earthy tones look great with natural stone tiles and will make your bathroom feel like a cozy haven. Some other earthy tones include raw sienna, burnt umber, dandelion gold, mossy green and ochre rocky gray, and olive green. A combination of raw sienna, burnt umber, and mossy green will give off a nature lodge vibe. Earthy gold, olive green, and rocky gray mixed together will look like a mountain hideaway. Opt for matte finish with earth tones to keep the natural appeal."

          "headline":"Feel refreshed by using bright greens and whites.",
          "description":"Fresh, minty greens pair well with shades of white and will make your bathroom feel like a place for re-energizing yourself. Choose an electric lime green for a more playful, modern approach or a soft, natural mint for an understated (yet zesty) feel. For a zen-like atmosphere, opt for soft whites with jade green, adding wooden or gray-stone accents."

This pattern is great for small bathrooms because the arrowhead design (formed by the conjoining shapes and lines) will trick the eye into thinking the space is larger than it is. Use black and white tiles for a clean, classic look or pair white with any color of your choice\u2014ideally one that complements the wall color, cabinets, and decor."

If you're using white tiles, try a stripe of gray. If you're using colored tiles for most or all of the bathroom, choose a similar or complementary color (like a lighter or darker hue of that same color). Make your stripe color the same as any accent colors you have around the room as decor (e.g., if you have a bright orange shelf, make the stripe match that same orange)."

Choose black and white patterns for an elegant look or colored marbles (greens, maroons, blues) for a more playful, extravagant vibe. If genuine marble is too pricey, opt for synthetic marble. Marble tiles contain natural minerals that can turn rust-colored from exposure to heat and moisture. Before installation, do a quick test by placing one of the tiles in a bucket of water for 2 days, taking it out, and letting it sit for 2 more days. Take pictures before and after to help you spot any changes.

Aquatic colors (light ocean blues, sea-foam greens, and light sandy browns) are calming and will make you feel like you're right on the beach! These soft hues pair well with silver fixtures and light or dark wooden cabinets. Avoid adding too many pastels into the mix, as this can look kitschy. Keep it simple and focus on only 2 or 3 pastels. Increase the beach-appeal by combining pastel tiles with a tan colored stone (like marble, granite, or travertine). Blend earth-toned browns, greens, reds, and yellows for a natural look. Earthy tones look great with natural stone tiles and will make your bathroom feel like a cozy haven. Some other earthy tones include raw sienna, burnt umber, dandelion gold, mossy green and ochre rocky gray, and olive green.

Choose an electric lime green for a more playful, modern approach or a soft, natural mint for an understated (yet zesty) feel. For a zen-like atmosphere, opt for soft whites with jade green, adding wooden or gray-stone accents. Creating Patterns with Tiles Lay square tiles diagonally for a clean, classic look. Diagonal squares make the room look ordered and clean. Choose the exact opposite color for the grout lines to enhance the geometric look or select grout lines in a similar or neutral color for a more subtle esthetic. Keep grout lines clean by using a toothbrush to scrub away any dirt or residue. Make chevron patterns to elongate a room. Chevron tiles can be rectangles, rhombuses, or small stripes that form a zig-zag pattern when layered all together. This pattern is great for small bathrooms because the arrowhead design (formed by the conjoining shapes and lines) will trick the eye into thinking the space is larger than it is.
