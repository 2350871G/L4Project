          "description":"In most cases, a recipe will suggest one of two ways to do it. It may ask you to bring the liquid of a dish to a simmer, which means to slowly bring the liquid to just below boiling point over low heat. The other common direction is to bring the liquid of a dish to the boiling point first, and then reduce it to a simmer. The two techniques yield different results, so it\u2019s important to practice them properly. To simmer means to bring a liquid to a temperature that is just below the boiling point \u2013 somewhere between 185\u00b0F (85\u00b0C) and 205\u00b0F (96\u00b0C)."

          "description":"Place the dish you're cooking on the burner and start off at a medium to low heat. Stay near the stovetop, since you will probably need to adjust the heat up or down as the liquid is brought up to a simmer. It\u2019s a good rule of thumb to never turn your back on a simmer in progress until you\u2019re sure you\u2019ve reached a point of constant simmering. Experiment with a pot of water if you want to practice first. Try out different heat settings to get a feel for how the cooking liquid appears at different temperatures."

          "description":"You know something is simmering when there are pockets of tiny, continuous bubbles breaking the surface with irregular wisps of steam. Simmering is most commonly used to allow the flavors of a dish to infuse and to slow-cook meats until they are tender. A \u201cslow simmer\u201d is when a couple of tiny bubbles erupt every 1 or 2 seconds. A slow simmer is most often used to slow-cook stocks. A \u201crapid simmer\u201d happens when larger pockets of small, continuous bubbles erupt at the surface, displaying wisps of steam, with larger bubbles beginning to show. A rapid simmer is sometimes referred to as a gentle boil; it's mostly used to thicken liquid into sauce."

Most people don\u2019t use a thermometer \u2013 they gauge by observation. You'll get more experienced at this as you go along. Temperatures between 185\u00b0F (85\u00b0C) and 205\u00b0F (96\u00b0C) are considered simmering.

Slightly adjust the heat up or down as needed. Once you\u2019ve achieved a steady simmer, you will still need to stir the liquid occasionally. Whenever you introduce new ingredients to simmering liquid, the heat will definitely need to be adjusted. Some liquids and sauces require more frequent stirring than others. Check your recipe for details. Stay at your stove to supervise during this initial stage until you get a feel for how often it needs to be stirred."

The longer you simmer the sauce, the thicker it will become and the more it will \u201creduce.\u201d\nThe most commonly reduced sauces are tomato sauce, B\u00e9chamel sauce, balsamic reduction sauce, red wine reduction sauce and most sauces that begin with meat drippings.

Regulating the heat properly and frequent stirring helps to prevent a sauce form getting burned. Keep a close eye on this. If it does burn and you don't notice, you'll end up stirring charred bits from the bottom of the pan into your sauce. Avoid scraping anything against the bottom of the pan if you've burned the sauce.
