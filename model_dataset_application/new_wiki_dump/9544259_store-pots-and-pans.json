          "description":"If you have open cabinet space, line your shelves with drawer or shelf liner. Store your pots and pans on the shelves, being careful to only stack them on top of one another when necessary. If you do stack your pots and pans, line each one with a paper towel, cloth, or other soft material to prevent them from being damaged. Lingering moisture isn\u2019t great for most pots and pans and can create rust. Using a paper towel or other absorbent material will help get rid of extra water while also protecting the cookware from getting scratched."

Make sure the hooks are strong enough to hold each piece of cookware \u2014 the box that the hooks come in will say how much weight they can hold. For this method, make sure each pot or pan fits in the cabinet while hanging vertically."

The Lazy Susan makes reaching your cookware easy, and the door on the cabinet keeps your pots and pans out of sight. If you\u2019re stacking your cookware on a Lazy Susan, make sure to line each pot and pan with a paper towel to protect them."

Choose a sliding system that fits in your cabinet and follow the installation instructions that come with the specific organizer. These sliding systems make it easy to pull out a rack from your cabinet and reach all of your pots and pans. These sliding organizers can cost anywhere from $20 to $200, depending on the size and quality."

Many of them are a simple rack where you stash your cookware on its side. Tower racks are also an option, allowing you to lay your pots and pans down flat as you would to stack them, but the rack keeps them from touching. Racks will cost between $10 and $50, with most simple ones averaging around $15. Your lids should slide right up against the wall with the handle holding the lid up on the bar."

One hook will be placed at the bottom of the lid, and two other hooks should be installed on each side, holding the lid in place. If you're screwing the hooks into the cabinet, make sure you don't screw them all the way through to the front of the cabinet door. You can also use adhesive hooks to hold lids on a wall or side of a counter. Make sure you place the hooks evenly and strategically so that you can remove the lid easily from the hooks. You can do this by holding the lid up to the cabinet and marking where the hooks should go. Read the weight limit on the package of hooks to make sure they'll be able to hold your lids."

Purchase a hanging rack online or at a kitchen appliance store. It\u2019s also possible to make a hanging rack yourself using copper pipes, an old window, ladder, or wire shelving.

Use S-hooks to hang your pots and pans from the wall rack, giving you fast and easy access to your cookware. If you don\u2019t have a large wall, or you have lots of pots and pans, double up on the linear wall racks. By installing one wall rack above the other, you\u2019ll create tiered storage. Just be sure to leave enough room so that the pots and pans can hang without hitting the rack below them. A simple linear wall rack will cost under $20, but many high-end linear racks cost a little under $100."

This method will obscure most of the view from your window, so make sure you\u2019re ok with this look before installing the rod. You can buy a curtain rod for $10-$50, and a pack of S-hooks costs under $10."

To store many different pots and pans, place them on a wire shelf set up against the wall. The shelf doesn\u2019t have to be made of wire, but wire shelving is sturdier and won\u2019t be as easily damaged by wet cookware.
