  "text":" Wash your hands.  Prepare your work space. Make sure your counters are clean and that you've got enough room to move around, and have all of your utensils out and clean. Pre-heat the oven to 400 degrees.  Prepare your rice and get it started (it'll probably take about 20 minutes to cook, whether you cook it in a rice-cooker or a pot of water).  Open the ground turkey and the spicy turkey sausage. Slice the casings of the sausages and mix it up with the ground turkey. It may feel pretty gross, squishing when you mix it together, but it'll be worth it. Brown the meat in a deep pot, stirring often so the meat cooks all the way through. Add some salt and some pepper, if you like, maybe a little garlic or onion powder, if you're feeling spicy. Gather up all of your bell peppers while the meat is cooking.  Chop off the tops and set the tops aside, then pull out the insides so you've got a bunch of nice, little bowls.  Adjust the heat to low and pour in most of the spaghetti sauce once the turkey is cooked. Pop a lid on that bad boy, but don't forget about it! You'll have to stir it every couple of minutes or it'll start to splatter, because the bottom's going to heat up a lot faster than the sauce on top. Dump the cooked rice, carefully, right into the pot with the meat and the sauce and turn off the burner. Stir it up, put that lid back on, and set it aside. Pour that sauce you saved along the bottom of your baking dish, and then take your peppers and stand them right in the sauce.  Stir in a handful or two of that shredded cheese into your meat-sauce-rice mixture and then scoop it into the peppers. Sprinkle a little bit of cheese over them and then go find the pepper tops. Put the tops back on the peppers and slide that baking dish right into the oven. Let it bake for 20-30 minutes. Wash up all your dishes.
