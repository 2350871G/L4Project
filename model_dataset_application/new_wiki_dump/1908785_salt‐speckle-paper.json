If you want to keep the effect to a smaller part of the page, just cover that area with water. You don't need to use any special stroke for this. You can go back and forth with your brush or cover the area with small circles. You can use whatever kind of paintbrush you prefer, such as a flat sable brush or a round-tipped brush.

You can add more than one color if you want colors to fade into one another. If you're using more than one color, try adding the first color in long lines across the page. When you add the next color, blend it into the previous color by lightly going over part of the same area. You can create a similar blending effect by working in circular motions. After adding the first color in circular motions, work around the edges with a second color so it fades into the first one. To be able to see the effect better, use darker colors."

Alternatively, use a paintbrush to get it off the paper so you don't get salt all over your hand. Try to be gentle, as you could scratch your painting with the salt if you're not. You may need to rub at some of the salt with your fingers to get it off."

Instead of spreading like it would with just water, you'll get sunbursts or spikes of color going out from each dot. You could also try combining this technique with speckling to see what happens!"
