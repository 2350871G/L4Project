Then, pour 2 shots of moonshine and 12 oz (335 mL) of cola over the ice for a cool drink. Some moonshines have a cola taste to them due to the flavor of distilled corn, so this can make for an even sweeter drink."

Taste the drink to see if it\u2019s acceptable, and add more ginger ale until you reach a suitable taste. You should always use non-alcoholic ginger ale, rather than a ginger beer, if you want to make a weaker drink. The alcohol in ginger beer can actually make the moonshine taste stronger."

Keep a glass of pickle juice nearby to counteract the burning by taking a drink of the juice after each drink of moonshine. This can be especially helpful if you never drink whiskey since the saltiness of the pickle juice neutralizes the burn of the alcohol. You can use any kind of pickle juice or brine that you have available."

Even in small quantities, they can cause terrible headaches and discomfort. To prevent this, make \u201chalf shots\u201d of moonshine, or only take small sips from your glass to pace yourself. Keep in mind that illegally-distilled moonshine can contain very large amounts of methanol, which can cause blindness or even death if ingested."
