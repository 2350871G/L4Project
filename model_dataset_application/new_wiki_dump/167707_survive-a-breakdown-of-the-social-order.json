Venture out to procure your needed supplies. Be aware: in the immediate aftermath of a disastrous breakdown of the social order, if you are in an urban area, there will likely be many, many people looking for the same thing. Looting will be rampant and widespread, and in the chaos, you may not be able to reach your ideal supply centers. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/4b\\/Survive-a-Breakdown-of-the-Social-Order-Step-6Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Survive-a-Breakdown-of-the-Social-Order-Step-6Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/4b\\/Survive-a-Breakdown-of-the-Social-Order-Step-6Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-760px-Survive-a-Breakdown-of-the-Social-Order-Step-6Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nHave contingencies in mind: cast your net wide, but locally. Do not venture too far from your base of operations in search of needed supplies, and if other people are willing to fight or kill you for it, back away. The key is to be adaptable and to survive. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/2d\\/Survive-a-Breakdown-of-the-Social-Order-Step-6Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Survive-a-Breakdown-of-the-Social-Order-Step-6Bullet2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/2d\\/Survive-a-Breakdown-of-the-Social-Order-Step-6Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Survive-a-Breakdown-of-the-Social-Order-Step-6Bullet2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Having secured your supplies, it will be time to consolidate things back at home. This will call for you to become an effective leader: oftentimes even a well-prepared group can break down due to internal tensions. Keep a level head and try to be fair and impartial in dealing with difficult or stressful situations between people. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/2e\\/Survive-a-Breakdown-of-the-Social-Order-Step-7Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Survive-a-Breakdown-of-the-Social-Order-Step-7Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/2e\\/Survive-a-Breakdown-of-the-Social-Order-Step-7Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-760px-Survive-a-Breakdown-of-the-Social-Order-Step-7Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nYou will all be under a great deal of stress: try to encourage stress-relieving activities, such as plenty of exercise, board games and puzzles, reading, and investing time in learning useful practical skills. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/08\\/Survive-a-Breakdown-of-the-Social-Order-Step-7Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Survive-a-Breakdown-of-the-Social-Order-Step-7Bullet2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/08\\/Survive-a-Breakdown-of-the-Social-Order-Step-7Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Survive-a-Breakdown-of-the-Social-Order-Step-7Bullet2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nDelegate resources efficiently and according to need. Although some will obviously want special treatment, remember to keep in mind that your resources are limited. If necessary, use triage. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/49\\/Survive-a-Breakdown-of-the-Social-Order-Step-7Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Survive-a-Breakdown-of-the-Social-Order-Step-7Bullet3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/49\\/Survive-a-Breakdown-of-the-Social-Order-Step-7Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Survive-a-Breakdown-of-the-Social-Order-Step-7Bullet3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nGive everyone a useful task.

If you sense tension or anxiety growing between two people, try to get the issue out into the open before it can turn into a potentially deadly confrontation. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/1\\/1a\\/Survive-a-Breakdown-of-the-Social-Order-Step-7Bullet5.jpg\\/v4-460px-Survive-a-Breakdown-of-the-Social-Order-Step-7Bullet5.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/1\\/1a\\/Survive-a-Breakdown-of-the-Social-Order-Step-7Bullet5.jpg\\/v4-760px-Survive-a-Breakdown-of-the-Social-Order-Step-7Bullet5.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nIf conflicts are unavoidable, try first negotiating a compromise: speak to each person involved on a personal basis -- don't try to be a dictator. Calm spirits by speaking in a firm, but soothing tone. If the situation continues to degenerate, get friendly, neutral parties to restrain the combatants. Having created your small community, secured a supply of resources, and taken charge of its leadership, you will be well prepared to wait out the social breakdown until the rule of law is restored.  If it is truly catastrophic, resulting in national destruction and a regression of civilization, you will need to take further steps to ensure that your community becomes the nucleus for the rebirth of society.
