Try to pull away from them, then run as fast as you can in the direction of the nearest people or building that you can see. Especially avoid getting into a vehicle, since it will be much harder for authorities to find you if your attacker drives you a long distance. If you're taken hostage, the situation may unfold very quickly, and you might not have the opportunity to run."

Even if the attackers manage to subdue you, keep yelling to try to get someone's attention. If someone hears a shout and they see what's happening, they may be able to help you before you're taken. Try yelling something like, \"Help!\" or \"Call the police!\" At the very least, an onlooker can contact the authorities and let them know that an abduction has taken place. They may also to provide critical details like the kidnapper's physical appearance or the type of vehicle they're driving.

Fight in any way you're able, whether that's hitting, kicking, biting, or scratching. As you do that, try to target your kidnapper's eyes, nose, throat, or groin, as these are especially sensitive targets. As long as there's still a chance you could break free and run, it's worth fighting for. This is your best chance to escape, because the moment will be hectic, and there's a chance someone will see what's happening and intervene."

If there's nothing that you can use as an offensive weapon, check for anything you can use as a barrier between you and your attacker, like a chair or a table. For instance, even if your attacker knocks you down, you might spot a loose chunk of sidewalk that you can grab to hit them with. In your home, you might be able to grab a heavy vase or lamp, a fireplace poker, or even a large book."

Once you're abducted or taken hostage, it's best to take a measured approach to escaping, rather than an impulsive one, so start evaluating your surroundings rather than fighting to get away.

Wear nondescript clothing and avoid wearing jewelry or flashy shoes. Also, depending on where you're going, you may not want to carry high-value electronics like a smartphone, tablet, or nice camera. If you're traveling by foot, walk confidently and with purpose. Avoid stopping on the street to check a map, and take care whom you ask for directions since you want to avoid giving the appearance of being a lost tourist. Change up your routine every few days. Kidnappers often study a person's daily habits before attempting to take them. You can make yourself a more difficult target by making your movements unpredictable. For instance, you might plan out several paths to work or school, and change which one you take every 2-3 days. You can also eat lunch at a different restaurant each day, visit different bars or meet your friends at different times, or leave for work at a different time. If you do believe you're being followed in your vehicle, immediately drive to a police station or somewhere you feel safe. If you're walking, go into the nearest crowded, public space. If you're working for a government agency overseas, consider driving a nondescript vehicle without any obvious markings so you're less likely to be identified on the road. Take self-defense classes to feel more confident. A self-defense class can give you the tools you need to stay calm during a high-pressure situation like an attempted kidnapping. In addition, you'll learn effective ways to fight back if someone grabs you. Look online to find self-defense classes in your area. Talk to your doctor if your anxiety about kidnapping is interfering with your life. If you've taken steps to keep yourself safe, yet you're unable to stop thinking about or worrying about being kidnapped, it may help to talk to your primary care provider. They can help you evaluate whether your concerns are valid or if you may be struggling with an undiagnosed anxiety disorder. Your doctor may refer you to a counselor or therapist who specializes in anxiety.",
