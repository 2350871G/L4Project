          "description":"Although you need to take both bottles of SUPREP, you should not take them close together. Instead, you\u2019ll take one the night before your exam, and the other the morning of your exam. Taking them at the same time increases the risk of vomiting. Ask your doctor for a recommended time frame for taking the medication. It\u2019s best to take it well before bedtime, as you\u2019ll need to use the restroom often for the next several hours. However, everyone\u2019s experience is different. If your colonoscopy is scheduled before 11:00 a.m., then you\u2019ll likely take your first dose between 4:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. If your appointment is after 11:00 a.m., then you\u2019ll likely take the first dose between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. Then, finish your morning dose and accompanying water at least 4 hours before your appointment."

          "headline":"Mix your SUPREP with water according to your label\u2019s instructions.",
          "description":"SUPREP must be diluted with water. Do not simply sip from the bottle, which increases the likelihood you\u2019ll experience nausea or vomiting. The medicine must be diluted before you consume it. Your packaging will give you the proper ratio of water to SUPEP. In most cases, you\u2019ll add 10 fluid ounces (300 mL) of water to 6 fluid ounces (180 mL) of SUPREP. Your SUPREP kit should come with a mixing bottle that has a line at the 16  fl oz (470 mL) point. This allows you to pour your SUPREP into the bottle, then add water up to the mark. It's best to use bottled water to dilute your SUPREP."

          "description":"You might experience nausea and vomiting because you\u2019re intaking too much SUPREP at one time. Your body may start to reject the medicine, causing you to vomit. You can avoid this by slowing your pace. Sip rather than taking big gulps. If you feel a little nauseous, take a break before drinking more."

          "description":"It\u2019s best to rinse out your SUPREP mixing container and use it to measure out two 16  fl oz (470 mL) glasses of water. Although this is a lot of water to drink at one time, it\u2019s essential for ensuring the medication doesn\u2019t make you become dehydrated. You might become dehydrated because the SUPREP causes you to have diarrhea so your colon will be empty for your test. When you have diarrhea, your body loses fluids. You need to drink more fluids to replace what's being lost. Drinking cold water after the SUPREP can also help you avoid nausea and vomiting. It washes away the flavor of the medicine and helps soothe you."

It\u2019s also a good idea to use cold water to dilute your SUPREP. Even if the medication is at room temperature, cold water can make the mixture more palatable. Only add flavoring to your SUPREP if your doctor provided it in your kit or approved it. Some flavor packets may be okay, but it's possible to mess up your test results. For example, don't use anything with red coloring, as it might look like blood on your test."

You can place the candy in your mouth before each sip if this helps you keep the medicine down. Choose candies that don\u2019t have red dyes or soft centers in them.

Not only will eating interfere with your test results, it will also likely cause you to throw up. Stick to clear liquids only. To check if a liquid is clear, see if you can read through it. For example, apple juice has a slight color to it, but you can still read or see through it. However, orange juice is completely opaque. You can drink apple juice, but not orange juice. In addition to water, good options for clear liquids include Sprite, lemonade, and broth."

If you've experienced nausea in the past, you can discuss anti-nausea medicine with your doctor before your start SUPREP. Common anti-nausea medications include prochlorperazine (Compazine), ondansetron (Zofran), promethazine (Phenergan), metoclopramide (Reglan). If you take an anti-nausea medication, only take one.
