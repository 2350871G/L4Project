You may do it if you don't have a nice weapon but if you do have one try to master it. Know its RANGE, RECOIL, POWER and how to use it efficiently. It's all up to you on how well you know your weapon."

Enhance your skills by playing fair and not under the table. Sometimes the X-Trap GameGuard cannot always detect cheat programs, but other players could save the game and can easily REPORT you in forums and if you were proven guilty, may result to a ban."

      "description":"Cooperation gives a higher possibility of winning a match; going it alone always has a high chance of causing a team loss. Learning how to use radio messages is a very big help for your team, like when you spotted the C4, just press \"Z+4\". It notifies the them to guard the dropped C4 that should be planted by BlackList Team before time runs out. Don't always blame your teammates because you always die without getting help from them. Remember, not all players can act just like what you expect them to act. When you die, try to reflect on it and think on some ways to prevent dying again. Don't always rely on your team, sometimes you are still responsible on your own. Every player is important in every match just like in the game of chess."
