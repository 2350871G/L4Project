Flash is best suited for simple games, so focus on creating a game that has only a few mechanics for the player to worry about. Try to have a basic genre and some mechanics in mind before you start prototyping. See this guide for more details on the planning phases of video game development. Common Flash games include: \nEndless runners: These games automatically move the character, and the player is responsible for jumping over obstacles or otherwise interacting with the game. The player typically only has one or two options when it comes to controls. Brawlers: These are typically sidescrolling and task the player with defeating enemies to progress. The player character often has several moves that they can perform to defeat enemies. Puzzles: These games ask the player to solve puzzles to beat each level. These can range from Match-3 style such as Bejeweled to more complex puzzle solving typically found in Adventure games. RPGs: These games focus on character development and progression, and have the player moving through multiple environments with a variety of enemy types. Combat mechanics vary wildly from RPG to RPG, but many are turn-based. RPGs can be significantly more difficult to code than a simple action game."

Variables are defined by the code var and must be one word. var playerHealth:Number = 100;\n\n// \"var\" designates that you are defining a variable. // \"playerHealth\" is the variable name. // \"Number\" is the type of data. // \"100\" is the value assigned to the variable. // All actionscript lines end with \";\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tEvent Handlers - Event handlers look for specific things to occur, and then tells the rest of the program. This is essential for player input and repeating code. Event handlers typically call upon functions. addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, swingSword);\n\n// \"addEventListener()\" defines the event handler. // \"MouseEvent\" is the category of input that is being listened for. // \".CLICK\" is the specific event in the MouseEvent category. // \"swingSword\" is the function that is called when the event occurs. Function - Sections of code assigned to a keyword that can be called upon later. Functions handle the bulk of your game's programming, and complex games can have hundreds of functions while simpler games may only have a few. They can be in any order since they only work when they are called upon. function swingSword (e:MouseEvent):void;\n{\n\t//Your code goes here\n}\n\n// \"function\" is the keyword that appears at the start of every function. // \"swingSword\" is the name of the function. // \"e:MouseEvent\" is an added parameter, showing that the function \n// is called from the event listener. // \":void\" is the value that is returned by the function.

You can copy the already created instance multiple times by clicking the Library tab and dragging the instance onto the scene.

Flash is best-suited for 2D games. It is possible to create 3D games in Flash, but it is very advanced and requires significant knowledge of the language. Almost every successful Flash game has been 2D. Flash games are also best suited for quick sessions. This is because most Flash game players play when they have a little free time, such as on breaks, meaning gaming sessions are typically 15 minutes or less. Familiarize yourself with the ActionScript3 (AS3) language. Flash games are programmed in AS3, and you will need to have some basic understanding of how it works in order to successfully create a game. You can create a simple game with a rudimentary understanding of how to code in AS3. There are several books about ActionScript available on Amazon and other stores, along with a large number of tutorials and examples online. Download Flash Professional. This program costs money, but is the best way to create Flash programs quickly. There are other options available, including open-source options, but they often lack compatibility or take longer to accomplish the same tasks. Flash Professional is the only program you will need to start creating games. Writing a Basic Game Understand the basic building blocks of AS3 code.

If no value\n// is returned, use :void. Create an object. ActionScript is used to affect objects in Flash. In order to make a game, you will need to create objects that the player will interact with. Depending on the guides you are reading, objects may be referred to as sprites, actors, or movie clips. For this simple game, you will be creating a rectangle. Open Flash Professional if you haven't already. Create a new ActionScript 3 project. Click the Rectangle drawing tool from the Tools panel. This panel may be in different locations depending on the configuration of Flash Professional. Draw a rectangle in your Scene window. Select the rectangle using the Selection tool. Assign properties to the object. With your newly-created rectangle selected, open the Modify menu and select \"Convert to Symbol\". You can also press F8 as a shortcut. In the \"Convert to Symbol\" window, give the object an easily recognizable name, such as \"enemy\". Find the Properties window. At the top of the window, there will be a blank text field labeled \"Instance name\" when you hover over it. Name it the same as you did when you converted it to a symbol (\"enemy\"). This creates a unique name that can be interacted with through AS3 code. Each \"instance\" is a separate object that can be affected by code.

Each time you add one, the name will be changed to designate that it's a separate object (\"enemy\", \"enemy1\", \"enemy2\", etc.). When you refer to the objects in the code, you simply need to use the instance name, in this case \"enemy\". Learn how you can change the properties of an instance. Once you have an instance made, you can adjust the properties through AS3. This can let you move the object around the screen, resize it, and so on. You can adjust properties by typing the instance, followed by a period \". \", followed by the property, followed by the value: \n\t\t\nenemy.x = 150; This affects the position of the enemy object on the X-axis. enemy.y = 150; This affects the position of the enemy object on the Y-axis. The Y-axis is calculated from the top of the scene. enemy.rotation = 45; Rotates the enemy object 45\u00b0 clockwise. enemy.scaleX = 3; Stretches the width of the enemy object by a factor of 3. A (-) number will flip the object. enemy.scaleY = 0.5; Squishes the object to half its height. Examine the trace() command. This command will return the current values for specific objects, and is useful for determining if everything is running as it should. You may not want to include the Trace command in your final code, but it is useful for debugging. Build a basic game using the above information. Now that you have a basic understanding of the core functions, you can create a game where the enemy changes size every time you click on it, until it runs out of health. var enemyHP:Number = 100; \n// sets the enemy's HP (health) to 100 at the start. var playerAttack:Number = 10; \n// sets the players attack power when they click. enemy.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, attackEnemy); \n// By adding this function directly to the enemy object, \n// the function only happens when the object itself is \n// clicked, as opposed to clicking anywhere on the screen. setEnemyLocation(); \n// This calls the following function to place the enemy\n// on the screen.

Once you've created the code, you can test your new game. Click the Control menu and select Test Movie. Your game will begin, and you can click the enemy object to change its size. Your Trace outputs will be displayed in the Output window. Learning Advanced Techniques Learn how packages work. ActionScript is based off Java, and uses a very similar package system. Packages allow you to store variables, constants, functions, and other information in separate files, and then import these files into your program. These are especially useful if you want to use a package that someone else has developed that will make your game easier to create. See this guide for more details on how packages work in Java. Build your project folders. If you're creating a game with multiple images and sound clips, you'll want to create a folder structure for your game.
