Cut the strawberries into halves, if they're small, or quarters, if they're large. You should end up with about 1 cup of chopped strawberries. If you like more strawberries in the filling, adjust the ratio. For example, you could use 3 cups of strawberries and reduce the rhubarb to 4 cups."

Take a large chef's knife and carefully cut off and discard the ends of the stalks. Cut the stalks into 3/4-inch thick pieces. You should end up with about 6 cups of chopped rhubarb."

The strawberries and rhubarb should be completely coated in the sugary mixture. Let the filling sit for about 30 minutes while you prepare the rest of the pie. You'll notice the mixture becomes syrupy the longer it sits. You can now bake the strawberry rhubarb filling in a pie or tart or use it in another dessert recipe."

Pinch or crimp the edges of the dough to seal the top and bottom layers of pie crust. Cut a few slits in the top of the crust. Dip a pastry brush in one beaten egg and spread it over the top crust. Sprinkle the top of the pie with 1 tablespoon of coarse sugar. If you want a lighter crust, use an egg-white wash instead of using one whole beaten egg."

          "description":"Cover the edges of the pie with a pie guard or wrap foil around the edges. Put the pie in the preheated oven and bake it for 15 minutes. Then turn down the heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and bake it for another 45 to 50 minutes. The crust should turn golden brown and the filling may bubble up through the top of the crust. If you live at high altitude, you may need to bake the pie at 450 degrees F (232 C) and 400 degrees F (204 C). Let the pie cool a little before you serve it. This will help it set up and thicken a little."
