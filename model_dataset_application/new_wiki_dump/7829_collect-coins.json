Though it may seem daunting at first, picking a style of coin to search for will keep you focused and make the hunt far more enjoyable. Remember, there\u2019s no right way to collect, so pick a type of coin that speaks to you. Some ideas include:\nA penny from each year you\u2019ve been alive. One of every coin available in the US since World War II. One of every country\u2019s lowest-valued coin from the year you were born."

          "description":"Old, rare, misprinted, and uncirculated coins are cool, but they are also incredibly expensive. Cheaper alternatives include generally circulated coins, which can be found by digging through pocket change and bank rolls, or special currencies released in the recent past, like the US State Quarters line. Many foreign coins sell for far less than their US counterparts. For budget collecting, look for 5 cent pieces from the Netherlands (1913-40), Canada (1922-36), and France (1898-1921) or coins from small countries like Luxembourg."

Look for coins that have retained most of their reflective properties, meaning they have not changed hands often. Even if a coin is 500 years old, collectors should expect it to be in reasonably good condition."

These stores offer a wide range of coins at competitive price-points, making them a great place for new collectors. Most shop owners are collectors at heart and can help you assess the value of individual coins, connect with other sellers, and find valuable, updated collecting resources. Some coin shops will purchase coins directly from consumers while others buy only from trusted retailers. Expect dealers to charge up to 20% more than individual sellers."

Websites like AuctionZip can help you find upcoming auctions, while the American Numismatic Association keeps a list of upcoming coin and money expos on their website. Though eBay and other major marketplaces can yield good results, it is nearly impossible to check or ensure the quality of a coin before purchase. Instead, try specialty sites like Great Collections or Heritage Auctions."

In the long term, club members who decide to sell their coins often give priority and lower prices to friends made through the organization. Organizations like the American Numismatic Association offer online directories that can connect you with local and regional clubs."

Consult current pricing guides, like the printed Handbook of United States Coins or the web-based Professional Coin Grading Service, before committing to any purchases. These will allow you to find and compare the current market price of different coins and grades. For foreign coins, look at nation-specific guides and databases like Numista.

If you found it at a garage sale, flea market, or similar establishment, the seller may not know the actual value of their merchandise, but specialty sellers and collectors certainly do."

Here, coins are ranked on a scale from 0 to 70, with extra points being given to uncirculated coins. Letters are added to denote quality, like MS for Mint State or VG for Very Good. In this system, the highest quality coin is listed as MS-70. In general, US appraisers are more lenient than UK ones, so be aware that a perfect coin in one country may be considered flawed in another. Some people overgrade their own coins to make them more market friendly. To avoid being conned, make sure to double-check all coins using an official \u201cby the book\u201d standard. Remember that grading, even by a professional service, is subjective and that grading standards change over time."

Pay close attention to shiny coins, as details may have been buffed away to appear glossier."

Additionally, weighing a coin can help you figure out its melt value, or how much it would go for if melted down into its raw materials."

This will protect your investment from floods, fires, and burglars, something especially important when dealing with expensive items. If you are collecting particularly rare or expensive coins, upgrade to a safe-deposit box at your local post office or bank for extra security.
