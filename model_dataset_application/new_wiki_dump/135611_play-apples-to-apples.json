One judge might choose the strongest direct match, such as a red card reading \u201cScissors\u201d for a green card reading \u201cSharp,\u201d while another will favor ironic or humorous associations.

You will replenish your red cards after every round, meaning that each player should always have seven red cards at the start of a new round. When each player has seven red cards in their hand, the game is ready to begin. Keep an eye on your red cards to make sure you have seven at at all times.
