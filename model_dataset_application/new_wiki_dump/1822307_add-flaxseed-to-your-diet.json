It is found in more than one form and each has different properties. Flaxseed comes in red to golden varieties. The color of the seed doesn\u2019t mean the nutritional content is different, but the seeds may have a slightly different flavor. You can try the different varieties and determine which one has the most pleasing flavor. Some natural food stores may let you sample them in store so you do not have to purchase several types."

The negative aspect to whole flaxseed is that the body may not fully digest the seed and the nutritional components may pass through the body unabsorbed. You can purchase whole flax seeds and grind them in your blender or coffee mill."

Ground flaxseed can be purchased or it can be made at home. Ground flaxseed also allows for complete absorption of the nutritional components by the body. The drawback to purchasing ground flaxseed is the short shelf life. It doesn\u2019t last for more than a few weeks once it has been opened and should be stored in a cool, dark place for best quality. Unless stored in special mylar packaging, ground flaxseed loses much of its nutritional potency, or active compounds, within 24 hours. If you wish to store it long-term, make sure you are keeping the flaxseed in a resealable mylar bag."

Some popular baked uses of flaxseed are in breads or muffins. It has a good heat stability so all the nutrients are available after the baking process and is a good way to get extra fiber in a baked item without affecting texture and taste dramatically. Because of its high oil content, flaxseed can replace oil in baking recipes. Use one cup of milled flaxseed to replace 1/3 cup of oil (3:1 substitution ratio)."

This mixture can replace one egg in baking recipes. \"Flax eggs\" do not work equally well in all recipes, but it is good for fluffy baked goods such as pancakes, quick breads, brownies, muffins, and cookies.
