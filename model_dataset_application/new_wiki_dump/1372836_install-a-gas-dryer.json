Some older homes only offer 110 volt service, while most modern homes are equipped to support 240 volt service. Check your circuit breaker to make sure you have two columns of 120 volt circuits. If you\u2019re not sure what to look for, ask a qualified electrician to look at your circuit breaker and make sure that your home can handle a 120 volt dryer."

The gas valve can be turned off at the supply valve for the dryer\u2019s gas pipe, or at the main gas service shutoff valve. The location of the main shut off valve varies from home to home. In many homes, the gas valve can be turned off by using a 12 to 15 inch (30.5 to 38.1 cm) adjustable wrench.

You may need an adapter to attach the 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) end of the pipe connector to the 3/8 inch (1 cm) pipe end on the dryer. Make sure your connector is long enough to connect your dryer to the pipe in your wall. Do not attempt to reuse an old pipe connector!
