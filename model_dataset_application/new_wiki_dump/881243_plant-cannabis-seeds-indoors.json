Any seeds that have not opened and grown roots within a few days should be discarded, as they are not viable. Planting the Seeds Fill small, 2 inches (5.1 cm) garden pots with potting soil. Get plastic garden pots that are small enough to house the seeds. Look for garden pots at your local garden supply store or online. Use potting soil that is loose and airy. The potting soil should be moist to the touch. Fill the pots \u00be of the way with the soil. As an alternative to soil, you can use starter cubes from your local nursery or online.
