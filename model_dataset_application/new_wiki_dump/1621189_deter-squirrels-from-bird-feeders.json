Give a clearance of about 8-10 feet from these things. The baffle will go on the bottom half of the post, to keep squirrels from accessing the feeders from the ground. So, making sure they don\u2019t have access from the top is important if you want the baffle to work. Bowl-shaped baffles can go on top of the feeder pole to keep out squirrels, but these baffles don\u2019t do so well keeping out other critters, like raccoons. If raccoons aren\u2019t a problem where you live, then a bowl-shaped baffle will probably work fine."

Simply drill a hole big enough for the feeder pole in the stovepipe end cap, screw the end cap into the stovepipe to secure it, slide the stovepipe onto the pole and clip the hose clamp below it. Let the stovepipe rest on the clamp. You\u2019ll need a drill to make your own baffle, so if you don\u2019t have any power tools, your best option is to buy a pre-made baffle."
