  "text":" Cut the butter into small, even squares. Place the chopped butter, sugar, water, and corn syrup in a large heavy saucepan over medium heat. Stir the mixture constantly until the sugar is dissolved and the butter is melted. Insert a candy thermometer and bring the candy to a boil. Periodically brush down the sides of the pan with a wet pastry brush to prevent sugar crystals from forming on the sides and turning your candy unpleasantly gritty. Cook the candy, stirring frequently, until it reaches 300 degrees on the candy thermometer. If the candy appears to separate (with a layer of melted butter on top) carefully stir it vigorously to make it come back together again. Watch the candy as it approaches 300 \u00b0F (149 \u00b0C), since it cooks quickly and can easily scorch at high temperatures. As it reaches the proper temperature it will turn a dark, golden amber color. Remove the pan from the heat once the candy reaches 300 \u00b0F (149 \u00b0C). Carefully remove the pan from heat and pour the toffee onto the prepared baking sheet. Immediately after the toffee is poured onto the baking sheet, use a spatula to spread the candy to an even thickness.  Allow the toffee to begin to set for a minute or two, then spray a knife with nonstick cooking spray and score the toffee into small squares or rectangles, firmly cutting through to the bottom of the pan. Allow the toffee to cool completely. Break the candy apart on the scored lines into small squares once it has begun to cool. At this point, the toffee is finished and can be served plain. If you wish to dip it in chocolate, proceed to the next step. Dip the toffee in chocolate, begin by melting the chocolate. Place it in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave it in one-minute increments, stirring after every minute to prevent overheating. Dip each piece of toffee in the chocolate. You can dip it halfway in, or if you prefer, you can use a fork or dipping tools to submerge the toffee pieces entirely in chocolate. Remove the toffee from the chocolate and drag the bottom of the fork across the lip of the bowl to remove excess chocolate. Place dipped toffee pieces on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil.
