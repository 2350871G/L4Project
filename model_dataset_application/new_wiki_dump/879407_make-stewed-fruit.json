As fruits vary greatly in sweetness, there is no precise amount to add. Taste small pieces of your fruit as you go along and add extra sugar as needed. Start by mixing in a small amount of sugar, like one to two teaspoons. After the sugar is equally dispersed in the fruit, taste your fruit. If the fruit does not feel sweet enough, add an additional teaspoon at a time until your fruit reaches your desired level of sweetness."
