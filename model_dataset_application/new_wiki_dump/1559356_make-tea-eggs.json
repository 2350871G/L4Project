  "text":" Cooking the Eggs Cover eggs with cold water. Place six large eggs in a saucepan. Pour water over them until they are covered to a depth of 1 inch (2.5 cm). Bring to a boil, then remove from heat. Turn the heat to high. As soon as the water reaches a rolling boil, remove the pan from the heat and cover it. Let stand about 10 minutes. Leave the eggs covered in the hot water for about ten minutes to finish hard cooking. Continue on to the next step while you wait. This method of making hard boiled eggs helps prevent tough egg whites. Large eggs typically take 12 minutes to finish hard boiling, but these eggs are going to get a little more cooking later. Small eggs require less cooking time. Infusing the Eggs with Tea Bring more water to a boil. Bring about 2 cups (about 0.5 L) water to a boil in a second saucepan, then turn off the heat. Add the tea. For the strongest flavor, choose a smoky black tea such as Lapsang Souchong, or another strong black tea such as Assam. Put in 2 tbsp (30 mL) of loose leaf tea, or two tea bags. A tea that brews to a deep red color is best for a beautifully marbled egg. Steep tea with other marinade ingredients. Tea eggs get their flavor and color from soy sauce and Chinese spices.
