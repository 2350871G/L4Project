If the \u201cBest By\u201d or \u201cUse By\u201d date hasn\u2019t passed yet, it\u2019s likely that your oat milk is still safe to drink. If the date has passed, check other characteristics of the milk to ensure it\u2019s still good. If your oat milk has been open for more than 10 days but the expiration date hasn't passed, it's best to still check whether it's spoiled or not before drinking it."
