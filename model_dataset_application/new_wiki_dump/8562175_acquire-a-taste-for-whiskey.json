Most whiskeys are made out of fermented grain mash (barley, corn, wheat, or rye) and aged in oak casks for a number of years\n\nScotch is whiskey made in Scotland, usually from malted barley. Bourbon is whiskey made in the United States, usually from corn. Rye whiskey is made from at least 51% rye. Single malt whiskey is whiskey created at a single distillery, though the distiller may combine whiskeys from many different casks to achieve the desired taste. Blended malt whiskey is whiskey made from the products of multiple distilleries. Single cask whiskey is whiskey is produced from one individual cask at a single distillery location."

Try to pick up what scents you\u2019re smelling. Perhaps it\u2019s a floral bouquet, or maybe something a bit sweeter. Maybe you notice a woody, earthy tone. Put your nose actually inside the glass to get the best angle for smelling. This will help you fully appreciate the range of the bouquet."

Once you have tried the whiskey unaltered, try cutting it with a dropper full of water. The water will bring out different flavors and aromas that complicate the tasting."

Some of the most important terms include:\n\nCask: A cask is an oak barrel that the whiskey is stored in while it ages in the distillery. Most whiskeys are aged for at least three years in a cask, while others age for longer periods of time (even as much as 25 years). Proof: This basically indicates the amount of alcohol in a particular whiskey, or how strong the drink is. The number corresponds to twice the amount of alcohol content by volume. For example, a whiskey that is 60% alcohol would be 120-proof. The larger the number, the stronger the drink will be. Maturation: This is the amount of time that the whiskey is left in the wooden cask to age (or mature)."

Compare them side by side and consider the different smells, flavors, and aromas that you sense in each. In general, it\u2019s probably true that older whiskeys taste better (and are more expensive) than younger whiskeys because of the greater length of time that was spent aging the liquor. However, this isn\u2019t true across the board. Many people say that 8-9 years is the best age for most whiskeys. If the whiskey is aged too long, it can take on too much flavor from the wood and become bitter."
