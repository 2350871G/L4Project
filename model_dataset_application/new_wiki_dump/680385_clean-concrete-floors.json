For oil or oil-based stains, wet the area with water and cover the stain with dish soap. Dip a brush in warm water and scrub the area to work up a lather. Blot the suds with a rag or towel and rinse it down with clean water. To remove mildew, mix one ounce (28.3 grams) each of laundry detergent and trisodium phosphate with one quart (946.4 ml) laundry bleach and three quarts (2.8 liters) of water. Scrub the area with a soft brush and rinse with clean water. To remove tire marks (in a garage), spray the area with water and apply a degreaser. Let sit for three to four hours, scrub with a brush, and rinse. To remove grease, spread kitty litter or cornstarch over the area and let it sit for about three days. After you\u2019ve let it sit, vacuum or sweep up the kitty litter and dispose of it in accordance with the type of grease it was (such as in the garbage or through a proper recycling facility)."

Dilute one part cleaner in three parts water and spray on the affected area. Let it sit for about 20 minutes, and then scrub with a brush. Rinse the area with clean water. Always wear gloves and proper protective gear when using harsh cleaners, and make sure the room is well-ventilated."
