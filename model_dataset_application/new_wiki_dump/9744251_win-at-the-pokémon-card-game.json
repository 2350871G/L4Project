How you build your deck will influence whether you win or not more than your decisions in battle will be. You simply won't win with a bad deck. In order to make a good deck, you will need 60 or more cards to work with, for a deck can only have up to 60 cards. If you slightly don\u2019t have enough, buy some booster packs; those will give you up to 10 cards each. If you really don\u2019t have enough, then it is recommended that you buy a theme deck, which will give you a deck of 60 cards. You can always buy more cards online, and change your theme deck if you want."

Decks mostly have up to two different types of Pok\u00e9mon, although some decks use more than two, or simply use only one. If you are using more than one type of Pok\u00e9mon, try to pick some that compliment each other. Electric and Water are good examples. Take advantage of your types. Put in types that help boost each other. For example: If you choose to have an Electric deck, and most of your Electric Pok\u00e9mon have Weakness to Fighting types, add is some Psychic Pok\u00e9mon cards, for Fighting Pok\u00e9mon mostly have Weakness for Psychic.

How you want to win influences the types and amount of specific cards you will need in your deck. Just ask yourself:\nHow do I want to win? What cards do I need to complete that goal?

How you build your deck will influence whether you win or not more than your decisions in battle will be. You simply won't win with a bad deck. In order to make a good deck, you will need 60 or more cards to work with, for a deck can only have up to 60 cards. If you slightly don\u2019t have enough, buy some booster packs; those will give you up to 10 cards each. If you really don\u2019t have enough, then it is recommended that you buy a theme deck, which will give you a deck of 60 cards. You can always buy more cards online, and change your theme deck if you want. Decide what type of deck you want. There are many types of Pok\u00e9mon to play with. Like playing with Electric, Fighting, Psychic, Grass, or Water types? Decks mostly have up to two different types of Pok\u00e9mon, although some decks use more than two, or simply use only one. If you are using more than one type of Pok\u00e9mon, try to pick some that compliment each other. Electric and Water are good examples. Take advantage of your types. Put in types that help boost each other. For example: If you choose to have an Electric deck, and most of your Electric Pok\u00e9mon have Weakness to Fighting types, add is some Psychic Pok\u00e9mon cards, for Fighting Pok\u00e9mon mostly have Weakness for Psychic. This helps make your typed stronger. Decide on how you want to win. There are many ways to win a game. You can either knock out all of your opponent\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon until they have none in their field, take all six of your prize cards, or make your opponent run out of cards in there deck.

That Pok\u00e9mon has high HP, has very strong, effective moves, but at the same time is a basic Pok\u00e9mon. Not all strong Pok\u00e9mon have to be evolutions, GXs, EXs, or Break cards. Keep that in mind when planning your deck. Include draw support. Draw support is the mark of a competitive deck. Include lots of powerful Trainers that help you draw more cards (Ultra Ball is a good example). Some Pok\u00e9mon have abilities,that can help you draw cards. The abilities of the Pok\u00e9mon Tapu Lele GX, Oranguru, and Octillery are great examples. Use your Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s abilities to help you draw cards in a match. (You usually don't put these Pok\u00e9mon in the active position). Supporter cards are special types of trainer cards that allow you to do extra things in a game that can really benift you. Most of the time, they allow you to draw cards. Include lots of supporters that help you draw cards. Include trainers to set up or boost your main Pok\u00e9mon. Trainers and supporters should help you get your main Pok\u00e9mon out of your deck, into your hand and into the action. Stage 2 Pok\u00e9mon especially need support to evolve quickly. Use trainers/supporters to supply energy quickly. Some Pok\u00e9mon become almost unstoppable with the right tool card. Others thrive when the right stadium card is in play. Put in Trainer cards that benefit your types the best. Balance your deck. A good, balanced deck usually has much more trainer cards and much less energy and Pok\u00e9mon cards than the theme decks do. This isn\u2019t always the case, though. Some very good decks have 20 of each type or card; it all depends on what you want your deck to do. Just be aware that you don't need the majority of your deck to be Pok\u00e9mon cards. Include cards that cover your deck's weaknesses and augment its strengths. Ideally, your deck will only use one energy type, but sometimes this may be too risky. Rainbow energy or similar cards can sometimes be used instead of including energy cards that your main Pok\u00e9mon can't use. Be aware that Pok\u00e9mon with colorless attack costs, which has a * symbol for the cost, can be used in any deck since they can use any type of energy. Colorless Pok\u00e9mon are normal or flying types can use any type of energy. Because of this, they can be used in any deck to fill up spaces and gaps. Be aware, though, that no Pok\u00e9mon has Weakness to Coloroless Pok\u00e9mon. Be sure to have enough Basic Pok\u00e9mon. Leaving your bench empty is the quickest way to loose the game. Add in some evolutions. Evolution Pok\u00e9mon include Stage Ones Stages Twos, and Break cards. These cards can help boost up your basic Pok\u00e9mon, for they give them higher HP, and stronger attacks. They can also have very useful abilities, Pok\u00e9-Powers, Pok\u00e9-Bodies, or any other useful effects that can help you out in battle. Don't have more evolution cards than basic Pok\u00e9mon; remember: a lot of basic Pok\u00e9mon is the key to success. Evolving Pok\u00e9mon can also get rid of Special conditions, and nay others effects to that\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon. Use that to your advantage. Review your deck. Consider each card and consider why it is in your deck. If you can not explain how it helps your main strategy, consider replacing it with something better. Find what is missing from your deck. Is your deck too slow or vulnerable to common threats? Search the internet for cards that you don't own. Sometimes, you need to buy more cards to perfect your deck. Remember that your deck has to have exactly 60 cards. If you don\u2019t have enough cards, remember that you can either:\nBuy a theme deck, which while provide you with a deck of 60 cards. Buy booster packs. Test your deck. Start by drawing cards a few times as you would if you were battling someone. Try this a few times. This helps you know what to expect from your deck. You\u2019ll know if your deck is battle-worthy if it usually gives you a decent starting Pok\u00e9mon and some draw support on your first turn. Play it against yourself (using another deck) to get a feel for its play style. You don't have to play an entire game with yourself. Testing your deck is the best way to spot overlooked weaknesses in your deck\nBe sure to shuffle your deck each time you do this to get a different result of cards, as this will happen when you\u2019re actually playing. Edit your deck. Adjust your deck based on your testing. Add more copies of vital cards and remove cards that you found were not as helpful as you thought. Your deck is now ready for battle! Your deck is not set in stone, however. Consider what you can improve after each battle. Always keep an open mind and watch out for new cards in the latest set. If your deck is based on a theme deck, and you have extra cards in hand, try changing it up a little. Add is some cards and take out some. If you don\u2019t have any extra cards, then buy some booster packs, which will provide with 10 additional cards. Winning During Battle Stay calm. Being calm relaxes your mind. It makes it easier to think. It is hard to strategize with a stressed mind. Breathe in and out. This is a very effective way to calm your mind. It is also quick, for you need to be quick on what your opponent is doing. Study your opponent\u2019s cards. See what their disadvantages and advantages are. Guess what strategy they are using. Ask yourself: \nHow can I defeat those Pok\u00e9mon? How will they be able to defeat mine? Look at the weaknesses and resistance of the Pok\u00e9mon in play. See if any of your opponent\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon have any weakness or advantages to yours or vice versa (the other way around). Weaknesses can make or break the game, and so can resistance. Try your best to use that information and make it to your advantage. The Weakness and Resistance of a Pok\u00e9mon can be found at the bottom-left corner of the Pok\u00e9mon card. Play the right energy on the right Pok\u00e9mon. Planning ahead is key. Don\u2019t rush to attach energy to just any Pok\u00e9mon. Keep track of how many energies you have used and how many you have left in your deck or prize cards. Guess what the playing field will look like in a few turns. What will you need? Focus on setting up Pok\u00e9mon you will need in the near future. Don't put energy on your dying active Pok\u00e9mon. It might be better to let it be knocked out so you can set up it's replacement. You don't have to play an energy just because you have it. It\u2019s also a good idea to put in a specific type of energy in the right type of Pok\u00e9mon. For example: fighting energy should go with fighting Pok\u00e9mon, and electric energy should go with electric Pok\u00e9mon. Evolve your Pok\u00e9mon. If you know that your Pok\u00e9mon is really weak, but you have the Evolution for that Pok\u00e9mon in your hand, then evolve it. That make sit stronger and have more HP. You can evolve multiple Pok\u00e9mon of you can. Use strategy on when to evolve it on the right time, though. You can\u2019t evolve a Pok\u00e9mon more than twice. You also cannot evolve a Pok\u00e9mon if it was just put in play, or of it is your very first turn. If your basic Pok\u00e9mon has a Special Condition, that\u2019s a perfect time to Evolve that Pok\u00e9mon. Retreat your Pok\u00e9mon. This is an option that is frequently underused. Retreating is a great way to save an EX or GX with low HP. Just be sure to have something ready to switch in. A well placed retreat can also serve as a devastating surprise attack. Quickly set up or evolve a Pok\u00e9mon your opponent didn't account for and switch it in on the same turn to really ruin their day. Be aware that it\u2019ll cost you some energy cards to retreat. Strong Pok\u00e9mon with no retreat cost are very valuable. If you can\u2019t retreat, then try to use the cards you have in your hand, like potions, to heal and revive your Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s health. Some Pok\u00e9mon cards have abilities, or attacks, that can heal other Pok\u00e9mon. Chaney is a great example. Use those specific Pok\u00e9mon cards to your advantage. Think before you attack. Many amateur trainers attack right away on their turn. Be sure consider what trainers/supporters are available. Before you at attack, ask yourself:\nDid I draw a card from my deck yet? How have things changed since last turn? Have I played an energy yet? Can I activate an ability or stadium card effect? Will my Pok\u00e9mon get knocked out on my opponent\u2019s turn after I attack? Do I have any cards in my hand to make the effect of the attack stronger? Use the cards in your hand. See if you have any Trainer, Stadium, Energy, or Pok\u00e9mon that you can use in the game. Your hand can provide you lots of assistance while playing. Be sure to really think about what you want to do with the cards in your hand first, before putting them in play. Sometimes it is better to save some cards for a rainy day. Remember to:\nEvolve your Pok\u00e9mon in play. You can\u2019t evolve a Pok\u00e9mon if it was just put in play on your field. Plus, if you evolved a Pok\u00e9mon, you can\u2019t evolve that Pok\u00e9mon again for that turn, for it counts as a new Pok\u00e9mon in play. You can evolve many different types of your Pok\u00e9mon per turn, though. Evolving a Pok\u00e9mon also gets rid of Special conditions, if your Pok\u00e9mon happens to have one. It also gets rid of other effects. Attach tools to your Pok\u00e9mon. You can do this as many times as you want. Be aware, though, that a Pok\u00e9mon can only have one tool attached to it, so be wise on which tool you put on a Pok\u00e9mon. Attach energy cards to your Pok\u00e9mon. You can only do this once per turn. Mostly all Pok\u00e9mon need energy to attack. The energy cost of an attack can be found at the left side of the attack move. If it has a grey spot, then the attack is free, and you can use it any time; you don\u2019t need attach energy in order to use that attack. Use any potions or other Trainer cards that can help revive your Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s health. You can do this as many times as you want for your Pok\u00e9mon. Once you use a your trainer card that heals, discard it. Play Stadium cards. They can give you power-ups or abilities that can favor your Pok\u00e9mon. Be aware that only one stadium card can be in play; once a different stadium card is put in play, discard the other one. Improvise. Sometimes, you don\u2019t always get the cards you need. If this is the case, try your best to see what you can work with. Sometimes, your very opponent can play a move that can benefit you. For example: your opponent may happen to play a stadium card that, yes, benefits him/her, but can also benefit you. Some things to do, or look out for, when no good come from your deck is:\nTo seeing if your Pok\u00e9mon can attack or not. To analyzing you Pok\u00e9mon if they have any special abilities that can benefit you and your Pok\u00e9mon. To spend the time planning in your head on how to defeat your opponent\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon. Predict your opponent\u2019s next move. Although this is pretty tricky, it is important to anticipate what is coming next. Does your opponent feel threatened or confident? Will he bide his time or strike fast and hard? Adjust to your opponent's play style and watch as he adjusts to yours. Try not to be too obvious when doing this. Example: bending over constantly to look at your opponent\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon card information. Also, think to yourself when doing this, for you don\u2019t what your opponent knowing what you\u2019re doing. Take your time. Don\u2019t rush what you\u2019re doing. Be calm and steady. Once you\u2019re sure that you want to attack, make the move. Be aware, though, that you cannot attack on your first turn in a game. Be sure to remember your strategy on winning. Using a Battle You\u2019ve Lost to You\u2019re Advantage Be a good sport. The first step in loosing a battle is not getting angry. Tell the person that they have a good deck, and that next time, when you and your opponent battle, you\u2019ll be stronger. Tell th person that, next time he/she is going down (in the most nicest and friendliest way possible). This builds up relationships when two people battle. If you get mad and loose it, your opponent will look at you as a sore looser, and won\u2019t want to battle you again. Try to remember what critically advantages your opponent\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon had on yours. Your opponent could have had some Pok\u00e9mon types that the majority of your Pok\u00e9mon have a Weakness to. For example: Lugia EX has a weakness to lightning types. The other most likely thing is that your opponent had resistance to your types of Pok\u00e9mon. For example: Raichu GX has resistance to metal types. Once you figure out the disadvantages that your Pok\u00e9mon have with your opponent\u2019s, add in different Pok\u00e9mon types that back each other\u2019s weaknesses, or effect your opponent\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s weaknesses. For example: Grass has a weakness to fire, but fire has a weakness to water, so have a Grass and Water deck! Or, add in types that have resistance to your opponent\u2019s types. The Weakness and Resistance of a Pok\u00e9mon can be found at the bottom-right side of the card. Recall all of the Trainer cards your opponent put down during the battle. Trainers can be essential in a game, and some can even make some Pok\u00e9mon invincible. Stadium cards are good examples. Knowing what Trainer cards your opponent has can really help you a lot, for you can decide what extra cards you can add into your deck that can counter those Trainer\u2019s effects. For example: Luxio from Sun and Moon\u2019s attack stops you\u2019re opponent from playing Item cards, which is a type of Trainer card. That prevents lots of effectived, which can help you a lot! Look through your deck again. Make a thorough sweep of the cards you have. This can help you to see what cards were in your deck while you were battling with your opponent. See if your deck is missing any critical cards, like a specific Trainer or Pok\u00e9mon. Your deck could be overwhelmed by some cards that throws off your deck, or just doesn\u2019t seem to fit in. Be sure to see if your energy cards, Pok\u00e9mon cards, and Trainer cards are balanced. In other words, see if the numbers of all of them correspond with each other, and that one number is way bigger or smaller than the other. Remember that you should roughly have about 20 of each. Refresh your deck. Once you\u2019ve figured out what you need to do with your deck, edit and revive it. Think about the steps above and what you\u2019ve chose to take out and what to add in. Be sure that, once you\u2019re done with editing, you recheck it; even one wrong card can mess up the whole entire deck. Be sure that your cards are balanced, and that you have what you think is necessary to beat your opponent. Remember that your deck must have 60 cards, unless you\u2019re both using a trainer deck, which has half that amount. If you don\u2019t have the cards you need, trade with your friends for card. Be aware, though, that you made need to give up so things in your deck. If they\u2019re nice enough, they may even give them away for free! Test your new and improved deck. If your deck provides you with the cards you need (one Basic Pok\u00e9mon, a few energies, and some Trainer cards) then, it\u2019s all set. If it doesn\u2019t, look through your deck again, edit what you think you left out, and try again. Prepare for a rematch. If you can, find your opponent and ask to battle. See how the match turns out, for your new deck may chance the results of the game, or make the game process change. If you loose, do not get upset. Do the steps above over again, expect try even more to narrow down what you want your deck to do, and make sure it has the cards needed to do so.",
