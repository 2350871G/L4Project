It\u2019s fairly common for the lock function to get stuck if the self-cleaning cycle was interrupted for any reason, like a power outage. If the outlet is hard to reach, you could also turn off the circuit breaker that powers your kitchen. Leave it off for 5 minutes before flipping it back on. This will also cut the power to your oven and hopefully reset the computer."

This should hopefully engage the lock function (even though it is already engaged) and then release it after you press the \u201cClear/Off\u201d button. Make sure to wait long enough after pressing \u201cSelf-Clean\u201d for the process to start. You can usually hear your oven\u2019s system start the cycle."

Give it several hours after the cleaning cycle to cool down, which should prompt the internal temperature gauge to release the lock function. The internal temperature needs to get back to around 200 \u00b0F (93 \u00b0C) or lower, and that may take anywhere from 30-90 minutes after the cleaning cycle is finished.Tip: If the oven still isn\u2019t unlocking at this stage, it could be that there is a problem with the temperature sensor. It may be registering that the oven is still at a high heat when, in actuality, it isn\u2019t."

Some companies may offer a free estimate, especially if you\u2019re a new customer, so spend some time looking at companies, reviews, and rates to find a provider you\u2019re comfortable with. Doing a DIY repair or finding a way to force the door open can result in more expensive damage than if you were to just call a repair person to come to take a look at the oven. Even if you manage to get the oven door open on your own, you still don\u2019t know the underlying cause that is making the lock function engage when it shouldn\u2019t be."

It may be something like pressing the \u201cClock\u201d button and the \u201cClear/Off\u201d button at the same time for 10 seconds, or holding down on the \u201cChild Lock\u201d button for 30 seconds.
