          "description":"A top discharge, 1/6 HP, dirty-water sump pump with a \u20444 inch (1.9 cm) diameter garden hose connection is recommended. You can use a side-discharge pump, but these often need priming. Clean-water pumps, designed for use in fountains, aren't appropriate for dirty bathwater, but could be used with clean water. Less powerful pumps tend to fill toilet tank slowly, or not at all. More powerful pumps tend to splash and perhaps overflow the toilet tank. You can use a connection to other sizes of hose, provided you have a hose of that size or an adapter to the size you do have. Note that larger diameters allow for faster flow. You won't need a float switch, and you can skip getting a check valve (backflow preventer), too. Test the sump pump by plugging it in, dry. If you don't hear any sound, it's not working. Unplug immediately and look for a reset switch, then try again. Unplug once testing is complete."

However, with a powerful pump, it could be useful in reducing the flow rate to a manageable level. The hose should reach floor, so its weight won't pull end out of tank when filled with water. You only need the connection to the pump. You can cut the other end off. If you've got a damaged hose, feel free to reuse that for this project. A longer hose is not necessarily better. It will take longer for the water to start flowing, the flow rate will be reduced, and the hose will take up more space and weigh more; once used, it will remain full of water, requiring more effort to move into the bucket or to drain."

It will take longer for the water to start flowing, the flow rate will be reduced, and the hose will take up more space and weigh more; once used, it will remain full of water, requiring more effort to move into the bucket or to drain. Get a large bucket to hold the dripping pump and hose when not in use. It should hold the volume of water from the hose, for when it drains back out the pump. Should have handle strong enough to lift bucket with sump pump, water, and hose inside. Get an extension cord if you need one to reach a plug. A power strip with an on/off switch is helpful, too. Without an on/off switch, it will be necessary to plug and unplug the pump each time it's used. Buy some wide tape to secure cords to floor to prevent tripping.

Use the setup for installation (below), but discharge into the toilet bowl instead of tank. Run until water comes out clean. Restart pump again to ensure water is still clear.

Don't plug into outlet unless you have a power strip between the two, turned off. Most sump pumps lack on/off switches, so expect it to come on as soon as it has electricity. Using the Sump Pump Ideally two people should be present. One monitors discharge to catch hose if it flips out, while the other operates the power switch. Turn the sump pump on. (Either by flipping the switch on the power strip, or by plugging it in, if you lack a switch.) Check if you need to prime the pump. If pump is on, but water does not flow, you may need to prime the pump. This is especially a problem with side-discharge pumps. Turn the pump off, then turn it upside down, entirely underwater, to let air bubbles out. Shake vigorously, until air bubbles stop. You may need to repeat this process several times, until water flows normally. When air gets back into pump, the process needs to be repeated, so turn the water on in tub if the water level drops near the intake. Fill toilet tank to fill line. Flush normally. Refill toilet tank, then turn off pump.  Lift end of hose above waterline in toilet tank to allow air in. This prevents suction from causing backflow back into the tub. Leave end of hose in toilet tank for next use, or remove the sump pump and hose, according to the next steps. Do not allow hose to fall onto floor, as the water inside it will pour out, even with the sump pump off. Removing the Sump Pump Remove the pump when you don't want it in the tub. When not in use, you can place the sump pump and hose in a bucket. Some dripping and backflow out of the hose is to be expected, unless equipped with a check valve. There's no need to drain and dry the pump between uses, as they are designed to sit wet. Leave it be if you prefer. If the tub is not needed for bathing, this setup can be left in place.",
