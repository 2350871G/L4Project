  "text":" Preparing the Sauce Place the avocado, garlic, lime juice, cilantro, salt, and pepper into a food processor or blender.  Process the ingredients until smooth and creamy.  Scrape the sauce out of the blender or food processor with a spatula. Put it into a medium-sized bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap to prevent the avocado from turning brown too quickly. Set it aside while you prepare your pasta. Preparing the Pasta Bring 5 cups of water to a boil in a medium-sized saucepan or cooking pot.  Add the pasta and reduce the heat to medium.  Give the pasta a stir to make sure that it doesn\u2019t all clump together at the bottom of the pot.  Cook the pasta for about 10 minutes, or until al dente. Read the instructions on the pasta package if you\u2019re unsure how long this will be. Note that if you\u2019re using fresh pasta, this takes less time to cook. Adding the Sauce Place a colander in the sink. Drain the water from the pasta. Uncover the bowl containing the avocado sauce while the pasta is draining.  Add the pasta to the avocado sauce and mix it together thoroughly.  Serve the dish immediately. Serve with fresh rolls and a salad, if desired.
