  "text":" Defrosting Your Refrigerator Empty out your refrigerator. Take this as an opportunity to get rid of all the junk or expired food you\u2019ve collected over time! To stop the rest of your food from spoiling when you remove it from the fridge, store it in coolers or on ice. Remove the shelves and drawers from your refrigerator. Though you don\u2019t necessarily need to clean them all, this would be a great time to do so. Be careful at this point, since cold plastic is more likely to be brittle and break.

If you\u2019re not in a rush, this is your best option to thoroughly defrost the fridge, though you will need to find a more stable and cool place to store food for this period of time. Speeding Up the Process Place a pot of hot or boiling water in the refrigerator. The heat will help to more quickly melt the ice and frost, but be careful! Make sure to put a towel, blanket, or pot holder underneath to protect your floors. Use a hair dryer to loosen and melt small bits of frost. For larger chunks of ice, loosen them first with the dryer, then use a soft, plastic spatula to chip away or pick it up out of the fridge.
