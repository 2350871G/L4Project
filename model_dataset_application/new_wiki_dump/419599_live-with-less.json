There are usually several spots to be picked up. The schedules are fairly regular. And in some locations, there are even employee commute plans and discounts. Jump on the train. Trains are a safe form of transportation that helps you avoid airport crowds, and you don\u2019t have to do any driving. On top of that, the scenery is great, the boarding times are flexible, and there are often discounted tickets for children. Ride the subway. Subway rides are incredibly affordable, flexible, and have diverse route combinations. You can travel all over a large city with very minimal effort or strain on the wallet."

It\u2019s not uncommon for live music to crank out of restaurant doors and windows until the wee hours. Find a comfortable location, order an hors d'oeuvre if you\u2019d like, and you can listen all night long. You might even dance along! Use free kids workshops. At many large-scale hardware stores, there are free weekend workshops. Great family entertainment! No tools or hard-hats required. Join local clubs. Look around your area and there are sure to be a variety of clubs. From book clubs to salsa clubs, you\u2019ll meet great people, have wonderful conversation, and share memorable experiences. You may even pick up a great skill."

BOGO, Buy One Get One, is something that happens at stores all the time. Especially large grocery stores. If you see something nonperishable that your family definitely is going to use in the future (e.g. toilet paper, soap, razors, batteries) and there is a BOGO, it may be time to stock up. The bill might hurt at first, but it will pay off eventually. Prep your meals before work. Avoid the temptations of going out to eat. You\u2019ll save big money not going out, some approximate it at about $500 per month.
