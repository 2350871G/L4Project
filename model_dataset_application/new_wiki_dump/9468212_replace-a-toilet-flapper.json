          "description":"Before you can replace a faulty flush valve seal, you\u2019ll need to stop the flow of water to the tank. Locate the shutoff valve on the lower part of the wall behind or beside the toilet. Turn the dial clockwise until it stops moving. If the valve does not turn by hand, spray it with a lubricant like WD-40 and let it sit for 5 minutes. Twist the valve back and forth to loosen it. Avoid using a pair of pliers since this could damage the valve and cause a water leak. You may still hear a trickling sound after shutting off the water. This is the stored water escaping from the tank, not fresh water being pumped in. If you\u2019re unable to find a shutoff valve in your bathroom, you may have to disable the water to the house."

Unclip the chain first, then pull the edges of the flapper free from the pegs to remove it. Be careful when taking out the flapper. Prolonged exposure to hard water can make the submerged components brittle, which could cause them to break into pieces if you handle them too roughly.
