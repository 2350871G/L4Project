To save time, you can chop the bell pepper first, then finish the other vegetables while you're waiting for the ground beef to finish browning in the next step."

          "headline":"Brown ground beef with the bell pepper on the stove.",
          "description":"Heat a frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the beef with a little cooking oil and use your spoon or spatula to break it into small chunks. After a few minutes, add the chopped bell pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until brown all over and no pinkness remains. This should take about five to seven minutes. When you're done cooking, there will be a little excess grease in the pan. Carefully drain this into a container that won't melt from the heat and toss in the garbage. Don't pour it down the sink \u2014 this can clog the drain. In a pinch, you can also microwave ground beef for five to seven minutes, breaking it up and stirring at the three minute mark."

        {
          "headline":"Simmer until thick.",
          "description":"When you notice boiling, reduce the heat to medium or low. The boiling should decrease to a light simmer. Cover loosely (with a gap in the lid to allow steam to escape). Simmer at this heat for 10-12 minutes or until the mixture is pleasantly thick. Stir every few minutes. Keep an eye on the texture and thickness of your mixture to prevent burning. The cooking time here will vary greatly depending on the starting thickness of your salsa. Very liquid salsas may take the full 12 minutes to thicken, but chunkier salsas will be ready much sooner. When it's done, your mixture should be thick enough to hold together in a spoon without running over the edges."

The recipe starts basically the same way: chop your lettuce, bell pepper, and tomatoes into small pieces so they'll cook quickly. For this recipe, you'll also want to chop about two medium onions and slice a handful of olives. If you are including the optional green onions and cilantro, chop these up at this point as well."

If you are using the optional cilantro and green onions, add these as well. Mix well to combine. Don't worry if the tomatoes make the mixture a little watery. Set aside when combined. If you have a lime handy, squeezing half of it over the mixture can lend it a bit of a tangy flavor. You can also try using a squirt of bottled lime juice. This isn't required, however."

Cook until well-browned and no pinkness remains (about five to ten minutes), stirring and breaking up the meat with your spoon or spatula. As noted above, when the meat is finished cooking, some grease will remain in the pan. Drain this carefully and dispose in the garbage."

Simmer until the water evaporates. If you don't have taco seasoning, it's not hard to make your own. Most commercial seasonings are just chili powder, cumin, paprika, and coriander, with a little salt, onion powder, and/or cayenne added for flavor.

Again, the exact arrangement here is up to you. One idea is to try laying chips in a circle around the edge of the plate, for instance.

If you're not sure whether your guests like these ingredients, putting them on the side is probably safest. To get a clean presentation, try using a melon baller or a tablespoon to get round, even scoops of each ingredient."
