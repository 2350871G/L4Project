          "description":"Portable generators make for good backup power sources in a pinch. Dual-fueled generators run on both gas and propane, making them versatile machines. Keep in mind that propane is less expensive than gas and easier to store, so avoid buying a generator that only runs on gas. These models need a fuel stabilizer if you want to store them with gas in the tank for a longer than a week.Tip: Since portable generators are also used on job sites, they tend to use a lot of power. Make sure to buy a machine that has more than 6,000 watts of power."

List items such as your fridge, microwave, oven, and air conditioner. Once you have your list, add the wattages together and multiply that number by 1.5 to account for the extra power your appliances need to start up. Some labels are on the door of the appliance, while others are on the back. If the label is on the back of the machine, you\u2019ll have to remove it from the wall. Wattage requirements for household items:\nRefrigerator: 700 \u2013 1,200 wattsFreezer: 500 \u2013 1,000 wattsMicrowave: 600 \u2013 1,200 watts\nIf you want to run these 3 appliances during an outage and their wattage adds up to 2,800, multiply that number by 1.5 to get 4,200. This means you\u2019ll need a generator with at least 4,200 watts to properly power these items."

A good-sized portable generator should be between 45\u201350 pounds (20\u201323 kg), but this is still fairly heavy. Even though these generators are lighter and smaller than other kinds of generators, they will still cost a few thousand dollars.
