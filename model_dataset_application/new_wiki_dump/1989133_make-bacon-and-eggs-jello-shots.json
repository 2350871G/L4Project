  "text":" Making the Bacon Bourbon Cook your bacon until it's crispy. Place your bacon in a cold ungreased skillet, preferably cast iron, and heat it over medium heat. As you'll be crumbling the bacon later, add a splash of water to the skillet to help the bacon get extra crispy. Bacon generally takes between 8 and 11 minutes to cook, turning it on occasion. Break your bacon into chunks. Remove your bacon from the heat and let it sit out for 10 to 20 minutes to cool. Then, use your fingers to break the bacon into tiny chunks roughly the size of bacon bits. Place the bacon and bourbon in an airtight container. A mason jar or similar container works well. Pour the bourbon into the container and then add the bacon. Seal the container tightly. It's not necessary to stir. Remove the bacon after three hours. Let your container sit somewhere in the kitchen for three hours. After three hours have passed, use a spoon or fork to pick the bacon out of the bourbon. Discard the bacon chunks. Refrigerate for two hours. After removing the bacon, set your bourbon in the fridge. Make sure to reseal the airtight container first. Leave the bourbon in the fridge for two hours. Strain the bourbon. Pour the bourbon through a mesh strainer into another mason jar. This should get out any lingering pieces of bacon you did not remove earlier. Seal the new container and set the bourbon aside for now. Making the Gelatin Mixture Combine the gelatin and water. Sprinkle the gelation on the bottom of a medium mixing bowl. Pour the cold water over the gelatin. Set the mixture aside until the gelatin has absorbed the water. When absorbed, the water will be mostly gone. Times vary, but this usually takes only a few minutes. Consult your gelatin's label for a specific timeframe. Boil your water. Boil your water in a saucepan over high heat. Let it come to a full boil before removing it from the heat. Mix the boiling water and brown sugar with the gelatin mixture. Immediately after boiling the water, pour it into the gelatin mixture. Use a wire whisk to mix everything into an even texture. Then, add the brown sugar and continue to whisk the ingredients until the sugar dissolves. Add the bourbon and apple juice. Pour your bourbon and apple juice into your gelatin mixture. Use a spoon to stir everything together into an even, uniform texture. Fill your shot glasses with the gelatin mixture. Place 12 shot-sized plastic cups on a baking tray. Fill each cup almost to the brim with your gelatin mixture. Refrigerate the shots for six hours. Place the baking tray somewhere in the fridge where it will not be disturbed. Give the gelatin six hours to set. Making the Candied Bacon Line a baking sheet with foil. Place foil over a baking sheet. Make sure to cover the sheet completely in foil. Combine the brown sugar and cayenne. In a small mixing bowl, measure out your brown sugar and cayenne. Use a fork or spoon to mix them until they make a uniform mixture. Coat the bacon in the sugar/cayenne mixture. Lay your bacon out on the baking sheet. Sprinkle the sugar/cayenne mixture over the bacon until it's fully coated. Flip it over and coat the other side. Cook your bacon at 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C). Cook the bacon for seven minutes. Then, flip the bacon over and cook it for an additional five minutes. When done, bacon should be dark and crispy. Cool your bacon. Remove your bacon from the oven and use a spatula to move it to a plate. Let the bacon cool for about 10 to 20 minutes or until it's cold to the touch. Crumble your bacon. Use your fingers to crumble the bacon into tiny pieces. Strive to get the bacon pieces as small as possible, so they look similar to bacon bits. Assembling Your Shots Add the bacon to your shots. Remove your shots from the fridge. Evenly distribute the bacon between the shots, sprinkling a small amount of bacon on top of each shot. Top each shot with a gummy egg. Place a gummy egg on top of the bacon. You can buy gummy eggs at most candy stores or online. Store the shots until you're ready to serve. Place a plastic lid on your shots and  then place the shots in the refrigerator. Leave them refrigerated until you're ready to serve them. Try to serve the shots within a few hours or the next day. While gelatin and alcohol last a long time, bacon only lasts for a week in the fridge. Make sure to use the shots within a week.",
