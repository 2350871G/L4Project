  "text":" Making a Simple Syrup and Filling Start with the simple syrup. Place equal amounts of both water and white sugar (1.5 cup) in stainless steel bowl. You may replace the simple syrup with honey. Heat up the mixture and wait for the sugar to melt completely. Avoid rapid stirring because it may form sugar crystals in your syrup. Sugar crystals are disfavored because they can harden your syrup once it is cold. Add 1 tablespoon  of concentrated lemon juice and 1 teaspoon of ground green cardamom. Let it boil for 10 minutes, and then set it aside and save it for later. Do not add the green cardamom and the lemon juice before sugar melts completely, because it may burn them and the flavor will be lost. You may also add vanilla or cinnamon. Make the filling. Blend together the following items until you have a grain-like mixture. Then set aside:\n\u00bd lb. green peanuts\n1 tbsp. sugar\n1 tbsp. ground green cardamom\n\u00bd cup of melted butter\n2 tablespoons rose water Making the Dough Mix together 2 cups of flour, 3 tablespoons of olive oil, and \u00bd a cup of water.
