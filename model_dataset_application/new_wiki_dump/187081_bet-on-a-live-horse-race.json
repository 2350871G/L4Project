Check out the horses' race records for a better indication of their winning ability. For instance, good odds for a horse might be 3-1 while long odds could be closer to 15-1. That means that the first horse has a 25% chance of winning, while the other horse only has a 6.25% chance. If you bet $2 USD on a horse with 3-1 odds, you will win $8 USD. If you bet the same amount of a horse with 15-1 odds, you will win $32 USD."
