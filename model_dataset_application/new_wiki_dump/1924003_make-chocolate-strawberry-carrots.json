The more the strawberry looks like a very fat, well endowed carrot, the better! But don't worry too much, the coating will create a lot of the visual effect. Larger strawberries provide the best effect because there is more room to imprint the carrot lines and to establish the carrot visual effect."

Carefully draw a line around the strawberry in three evenly spaced places. To do this, lay the strawberry on parchment paper and do one side, then allow to set. Once set, turn over the strawberry and do the other side, meeting at the same line ends."
