          "description":"Because hard water stains are alkaline, it\u2019s best to remove them with a powerful acid. Look for a cleaning product that contains either phosphoric, sulfuric, or hydrochloric acid, as these acids should be able to effectively break down the stains. Read the directions on the product\u2019s label and apply the acid cleaner to the stained areas as instructed. Acidic cleaning products are toxic, so be sure to take safety precautions when handling them, such as wearing eye protection and gloves, and don\u2019t use them on surfaces that come in contact with food, such as kitchen countertops. Acidic cleaning products work well on enamel and acrylic surfaces but can damage many others, including natural marble, stone, terrazzo, anodized or polished aluminum, and colored grout. To prevent damage, test the product in an inconspicuous area before using it on the entire stained area."

          "description":"Combine salt and water and use the mixture to remove the mineral buildup. The salt acts as a scouring powder and can cut through the stain. Apply the mixture to the area and use a clean cloth to rub the stain in a circular motion. Rinse the glass thoroughly when finished to remove all saltwater residue."

          "headline":"Use white vinegar.",
          "description":"Vinegar is an acid, which helps to loosen mineral deposits, and white vinegar is clear/colorless enough to not cause any staining. It\u2019s also a natural liquid cleaner that isn\u2019t toxic and won't potentially burn your eyes or lungs like other chemical cleaners. Mix some lemon juice into the vinegar to increase the effectiveness and add a fresh lemon scent. Lemon juice (another an acid) has the same effect on minerals as vinegar. Put your vinegar and lemon juice in a spray bottle and slightly warm them in the microwave, for 20-40 seconds depending on your microwave. A warmed cleaner can be more effective at lifting stains than cold or room temperature cleaner. Just be sure to remove the spray bottle top so that it doesn\u2019t explode in the microwave. Spray the vinegar solution on the glass and let it stand for about 2-3 minutes before wiping it clean with a dry, lint-free cloth or a paper towel. To remove hard water stains from drinking glasses and other small glass items, fill a basin with a 50/50 solution of vinegar and water, and allow the items to soak in the solution for several hours before rinsing thoroughly."
