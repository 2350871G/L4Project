Starting at the edge of your pancakes, pierce the layers of pancakes with your fork and hold the stack in place.

Hold the forkful over your plate for a moment to allow excess syrup or toppings to fall back onto your plate. Once you've got the pancakes in your mouth and the fork's out of the way, be sure to chew thoroughly before swallowing. Chew soft foods about 10 times before swallowing, and harder foods (like nuts) up to 30 times. To keep your pancakes in their stacked form, only cut off one bite at a time.

Thin out the batter by adding an extra quarter-cup to half-cup of water so the batter runs easily. Pour one-third to one-half cup of batter (per pancake) into the hot frying pan. Cook as before.
