      "description":"Resolution is a major factor. Projectors for viewing videos in a large room or auditorium, for example, will require a higher resolution than projectors used for PowerPoint presentations in an office. You need to choose a projector with a high enough resolution for its most frequent use. A resolution of 800 x 600 DPI (dots per square inch) is generally adequate for basic PowerPoint presentations in an office or conference room. 1024 x 768 or higher allows for more detail and 1280 x 1024 for an even higher quality image. Brightness and contrast are important elements of image quality. Projector brightness is measured in lumens. Lumens range from 500 to 1,000 for small, dark rooms to more than 2,000 lumens for large, brightly lit rooms. Purchase a projector that is rated for the most brightly-lit uses you anticipate. Additionally, the larger your screen size, the more brightness you will need."
