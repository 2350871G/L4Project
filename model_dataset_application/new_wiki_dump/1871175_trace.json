Put your tracing paper over the top of it; you can secure the corners of the paper if you would like, or leave it free so that you can adjust it as you draw. Outline your image.

To trace an image using transfer paper, you will need three pieces of paper: your image, your transfer paper, and your drawing paper. Place them on your table, and tape them down in order.
