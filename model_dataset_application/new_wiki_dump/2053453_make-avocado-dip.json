Make sure you choose avocados that give just a little when you press the skin with your finger. The skin should be deep green in color, with no black spots. If only underripe avocados are available, set them on the counter to ripen for a few days before making dip."

Press it in until you reach the pit, and slice all around the pit to divide the avocado into two length-wise halves. Separate the halves, remove the pit, and use a spoon to scoop the avocado meat into a bowl. Repeat with the remaining avocados. If the avocados are ripe, this process should be easy. The skin and pit will fall away from the meat, so you can make quick work of scooping it into the bowl. For less ripe avocados, you may need to use a knife to cut the avocado meat away from the pit."
