To add even more flair, purchase color flakes to throw in as you're painting the floor. Epoxy paint prevents oil stains and grease from sticking to the floor and is very easy to clean."

          "headline":"Use concrete paint if your floor contains too much moisture.",
          "description":"If, after leaving a plastic bag on the floor for 24 hours, moisture accumulates under the bag, regular concrete paint is a better option than epoxy. Choose either oil based or latex based paint from a local home improvement store. Use painters tape and a roll of paper to cover the bottom 12 in (30 cm) of the walls. Rinse the floor starting from the back and moving foward. When the floor is dry, use a 9 in (230 mm) paint roller to roll on the paint and let it dry according to the manufacturer's directions. Oil based paint will last longer but requires a primer before painting. Latex paint does not require a primer but is not as durable."

Sweep the floor and do a quick rinse. Snap the tiles together according to the manufacturer's instructions. Choose rigid floor tiles if you live in a climate where the temperature can change dramatically throughout the day. While floor tiles are a quick and easy way to make your floor look finished, they can be more expensive than paint and concrete sealers."

Trim the mat with a utility knife or scissors so that it fits evenly. While roll-out mats are easy to install, they also have drawbacks like getting slippery when wet and contracting and expanding due to temperature.
