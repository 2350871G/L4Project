Smaller varieties include Thumbelina, Romeo, Oxheart, Little Finger, Short 'n' Sweet, or Parisienne. You can also try Parmex, Danvers Half Long, Chantenay Red Core, and Shin Kuroda."

          "description":"Deeper is even better. Carrots develop underground, and the root system needs a lot of space to grow. Similarly, the wider the pot is, the more carrots you can grow. The container should also have adequate drainage holes to prevent excess water from causing the carrots to rot. The type of container does not matter much as long as it has enough depth. Clay, plastic, or stone is fine, whether circular or rectangular. If your pot doesn't have drainage holes, you can drill your own."

It can make up 30%-50% of your soil. Alternatively, you can add horticultural sand to the mix, and it can make up 30% of your soil. Try a mixture of red soil, decomposed compost, and sand mixed in equal portions for a soil-based media you make yourself. Consider coco peat mixed with a small amount of perlite for a soil-less media. Find all of these components at your local garden store. Ask a sales associate for a recommendation, if necessary."

You can also mix a slow-releasing fertilizer into the soil, but pick one that has less nitrogen, such as a 5-10-10 mix. Nitrogen will encourage leaf growth instead of carrot growth."
