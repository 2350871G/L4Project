Now, flip on the light switch, which is typically located on the bottom of the microscope. After flipping the switch, the light should come out of the illuminator, which is the light source. If your microscope uses a mirror instead of an illuminator to focus natural light onto your slide, skip this step."

Press down on the back end of each stage clip to raise them and slip the slide underneath the clips. Center the slide so that each clip rests on its left and right end and the sample is directly in the middle. Manually adjust the metal clips until your slide is even. If your microscope has a mechanical stage, move the curved metal slide holder to the side. Now, insert your specimen flush against the straight, stationary slide holder and release the curved piece so it moves back into place."
