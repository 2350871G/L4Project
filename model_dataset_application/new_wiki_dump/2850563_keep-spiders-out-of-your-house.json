          "description":"Fill a spray bottle with half white vinegar and half water. Then, apply the spray to any cracks or crevices in the floors, walls, or windows of your home, as well as on the window sills. Do this once a day to repel spiders. Vinegar may kill spiders if they come into direct contact with them, but even if you don't spray the spider directly, it can help ward them off. Do not apply the spray to any varnished surfaces, as the vinegar may damage them.

Chris Parker\t\t\tFounder, Parker Eco Pest Control\t\t\t\tConsider the benefits of spiders before you kill them. Certified pest management professional Chris Parker says: \"Spiders are really beneficial around your home because they eat insects, so if you can stand to leave them alone, you should. If you can't deal with them in your house, though, you can place sticky traps under your cabinets and in corners to catch and kill them.\""

Put 15-20 drops of essential oil in a spray bottle with 3 to 5 cups (710 to 1,180 ml) of water and spray your home once a day for a natural spider repellent. Swap out different essential oils in the spray so the spiders do not get used to the scent of 1 particular oil."
