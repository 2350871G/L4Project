Prepare the batter. Mix 3 cups of flour, 3 tablespoons of semolina wheat, 2 teaspoons of baking powder, 2 teaspoons of sugar, 2 cups of water, and 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil. Let it sit for 10 minutes. Baking the Pancakes Prepare a tray with nonstick cooking spray.  Pour about 1/4 cup of batter into a skillet on medium heat. Only cook one side until golden; leave the other side raw. Make sure to keep the size of the pancake about the same shown in the picture so that there are no complications in the stuffing and frying steps. Transfer it onto the tray. Line the pancakes up beside each other instead of letting them overlap, so they do not stick to each other. Repeat the past 2 steps until batter is finished.  Filling the Pancakes Put about 1 tablespoon of filling into each pancake.  Fold over and close each of them using the raw edges. Be sure to close them tightly so that they do not fall apart while frying them. Heat up the deep fryer. Then fry each of the Qatayef for about 2 to 3 minutes on medium heat. Once they are golden, transfer them from the fryer right into the cold syrup. Have them set in the syrup for one minute. Remove from the syrup. Then serve either warm or cold.",
