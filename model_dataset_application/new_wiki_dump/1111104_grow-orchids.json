Cattleya, Phalaenopsis and Paphiopedilum orchids are amongst the easiest to grow and are recommended for most beginner gardeners and orchid growers. There are, however, believed to be over 40,000 species of orchid species \u2014 that's two times the amount of existing bird species and four times the amount of existing mammalian species. There's almost literally an orchid for any type of person. Perhaps the most common genera of orchids found for sale include Phalaenopsis, Dendrobium and Oncidium. Phalaenopsis is known as the \"moth orchid\" and is extremely popular among beginning growers; the genus Dendrobium contains about 1,200 species of orchids and is the classic epiphyte of orchids; Oncidiums are characterized by column wings and a callus at the lip of the flower. Different genera of orchids have different ideal humidities, growing temperatures, watering schedules, and light requirements. Talk with your local nursery or visit the local chapter of your orchid society to find out what makes your genus of orchid grow best."

          "description":"Some first-time orchid growers make the mistake of assuming that orchids need to be potted in soil like other blooming flowers, choosing potting soil as a conduit. That would likely kill your orchid. Most orchid roots need far more air than potting soil would give them, but they still need something to anchor their roots, and so they benefit from a looser, more porous mix. Many people use bark chips, sphagnum moss, coconut husks, charcoal, perlite, and even styrofoam pellets as potting mix, often in combination. Experiment with porous, breathable mixes that you have on hand, or ask an expert for his or her special recipe."

Make sure to add water to your mix and strain it before using for best results. Make a fine potting mix, suitable for slipper orchids, most oncidiums, miltonias, and orchids with small roots that enjoy moisture more than most:4 parts fine (grain) fir bark or fine (grain) coco husk\n1 part fine (grain) charcoal\n1 part perlite\n\nMake a medium potting mix, suitable for cattleyas, phalaenopsis, and other mature orchids. If you're unsure of which mix to use, try the medium-grade potting mix before the fine-grade mix:4 parts medium (grain) fir bark or medium (grain) coco husk\n1 part medium (grain) charcoal\n1 part perlite"

Make sure to avoid decorative pots as well because the glaze is harmful to orchids. Remember, the enemy of orchids is often over-watering. Some orchids, such as cymbidiums, will require longer pots to accommodate very long root systems. The following types of pots offer a break from the traditional clay pot (which is perfectly acceptable and preferred by most orchid growers):\nNet pots, which have wire mesh and allow for a breathable environment. These can be hung in advantageous locations for better sunlight. Clear plastic pots, which get better sunlight to the roots. These allow the grower to inspect the root systems without disturbing the orchid. Wooden pots, which are constructed of rot-resistant wood.

Place your orchid near a south or east facing window. A west facing window may provide too much sunlight and a north facing window may not provide enough. Check your orchid's leaves if you want to diagnose whether it's getting too much light or not enough. Orchid leaves should be a light green with yellowish tones. If the leaves are dark green, it means that the orchid isn't getting enough light. If the leaves are yellow, brown, or reddish, it means they're getting too much. Low-light orchids ( Paphiopedilum, Phalaenopsis, and Oncidium) do best if they get northerly or easterly light. Moderate to high-light orchids (Cattleya, Dendrobium, and Vanda) prefer getting westerly or southerly light. Orchids love being behind curtains or window blinds.
