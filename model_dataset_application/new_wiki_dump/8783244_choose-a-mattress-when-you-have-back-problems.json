Your ideal mattress firmness should be somewhere in the middle of this scale. Mattress firmness scales aren't uniform across all manufacturers, so ask a store salesperson if their mattresses typically run softer or firmer. When you ask, don't immediately indicate whether you prefer one option over the other. That way, you'll have a better shot at getting a more objective answer."

The thickness of the individual coils determines the mattress firmness. Medium-firm to firm innerspring mattresses contain coils that are 2.2 to 2.4 millimeters in diameter. Some inner springs also contain a top foam or memory foam layer. Coil thickness has more to do with the mattress firmness than the top layer, so pay more attention to coil thickness than to the top layer."

If you sleep with a partner, the biggest pro to an adjustable air is the option to adjust individual halves to suit your preferences.

Keep in mind alternating sleeping positions helps ease back problems. Memory foam can also retain body heat, so you might want to avoid it if you get hot at night.
