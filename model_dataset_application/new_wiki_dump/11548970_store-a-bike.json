A garage is more secure than storing your bike outside and you don't have to worry about bringing a wet bike into your home. To make it easier to get your bike in and out of the garage, designate a bike-only space so it doesn't get blocked by storage containers, vehicles, or clutter."

If you can't, ensure that it's tucked back on your property so the shed is not visible from main roads. If you don't have space in your yard, consider placing a bike shed on an unused parking space."

Consider using a floor or gravity stand if you don't want to lift the entire bike. For example, if you use a horizontal wall mount, you'll lift the bike up so both ends are suspended by the mount. If you're using a hook, you'll probably need to hang just 1 of the tires by the hook so the bike dangles."
