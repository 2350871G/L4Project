  "text":" Making the firefly wings Draw a heart shape onto the blue construction paper. The heart size should correspond to what will be a suitable wing size when attached to the bottle, so make the heart larger for a large bottle or smaller for a small bottle. Cut around the heart shape.  Fold the heart in half. Cut down the fold line to form two separate wings for the firefly. Hot glue the wings to the bottle. Do this at what you deem is the \"back\" of the bottle, in a position where they wings can be seen easily when looking at it from the front. Take care to keep them aligned at the same level on the bottle. Making the firefly Glue googly eyes on the top of the cap of the bottle. Check that the cap faces frontwards before gluing. Allow to dry in place. Draw a smile under the eyes.  If wished, decorate the outer bottle with glitter glue for a sparkly look. Allow to dry before putting on display. Adding the glow Add a glow stick to the bottle. Open the lid, pop in the glow stick, then close the lid. Place the firefly in your room.
