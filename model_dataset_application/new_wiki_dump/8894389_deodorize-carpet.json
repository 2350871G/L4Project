Fill a measuring cup with baking soda and pour it into a colander while you walk on your carpet to provide an even dusting. Let the baking soda sit for 30 minutes to an hour and then vacuum it up. You can boost the cleaning power of baking soda by adding Borax. Combine 1 cup (220 g) of baking soda with 1 cup (409 g) of Borax. If you wish, you can add 1 tsp (~ 2.6 g) of a pleasant-smelling spice, like cinnamon, to the mix. Only do this on a dark-colored carpet, however, since spices can stain lighter carpets."

Let the carpet air dry. Be careful not to saturate the carpet too much, or mold and mildew may be encouraged to return. Don\u2019t worry about getting stuck with a lingering vinegar smell. Once the carpet dries out completely, the scent of the vinegar will disappear."

Put a little vodka in a spray bottle and spritz it on stubborn stains or odors. Let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes, then blot the area with a clean, dry towel. You can absorb any remaining moisture with a sprinkling of baking soda after blotting up the vodka with a towel."

Dispose of the onion in the morning and repeat this process each night until the musty smell subsides."
