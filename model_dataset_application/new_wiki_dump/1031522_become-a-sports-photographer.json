          "description":"Your smartphone probably isn\u2019t going to cut it for capturing professional sports shots. A DSLR digital camera is a good choice for beginners because it takes good quality shots, you can swap out lenses quickly, and it\u2019s affordable. You don\u2019t need to worry about how many frames per second it can shoot, or how many megapixels it has. What\u2019s more important is the quality of the lenses you use. DSLR cameras can cost anywhere from $400 for an entry-level model to $3000 for a model with a full-frame sensor. Review ConsumerReports or other online sources with camera reviews to see which brands and models people are having success with."

          "headline":"Purchase a lens with a wide aperture.",
          "description":"The lens kits that come with most cameras will not have a wide enough aperture to take sports shots at night. You\u2019ll need a lens that takes in as much light as possible, so look for a low \u201cf\u201d number associated with the aperture. For example, an f/2.8 is faster than an f/5.6. And be sure that the aperture stays low when the lens zooms."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Invest in a good telephoto lens.",
          "description":"You\u2019ll need a long telephoto lens to shoot games like football, where the action is far away from where you\u2019ll be. Look for a lens that\u2019s 200 or 300mm. If you need more depth later on you can add a teleconverter."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Buy several memory cards.",
          "description":"It's always a good idea to have a main memory card and a backup card in each camera bag you own, just in case you forget one or run out of storage during a game. Look for cards with a minimum of 32GB of storage and a speed that's labelled either Class 10 or UHS-1."

          "description":"Most of the lenses you\u2019ll be using are too heavy to hold in your hand and take stable shots at the same time. A tripod is too bulky to have with you on the field, so opt for a monopod with a good ball head to get a good combination of stability and flexibility."

To make yours stand out, try getting down on the ground and shooting the players from there, or going to a different side of the field from everyone else. They might have the best vantage point from where they are, but you could catch a great moment from an angle that no one else will have."

        {
          "headline":"Increase your shutter speed.",
          "description":"Take a few test shots at a shutter speed of 1/500 of a second. If the photos still look blurry, increase the speed. You can go as high as 1/1000 of a second to properly capture sports like motor racing. You may need to open your aperture as wide as it will go or increase your camera\u2019s ISO (its sensitivity to light) to reach these high shutter speeds."

          "headline":"Use burst mode.",
          "description":"Things can happen so quickly during a sporting event that it\u2019s easy to miss the perfect shot. Using your camera\u2019s burst mode, or continuous mode, will let you take 4 or 5 photos at once. Just be sure your memory card has tons of capacity, since this mode will fill it up faster."
