          "description":"Crown of thorns plants come in a range of sizes based on age, variety, and other factors, so select a pot that looks to be appropriately sized for your plant. Pick a sturdy pot material, such as terra cotta, especially if you plan to keep the plant outdoors part- or full-time. Most importantly, choose a pot with lots of holes in the bottom so that it drains quickly. A smaller pot should have at least 4 holes in the bottom, while larger pots should have 6 or more. Place a 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm) layer of gravel or broken terra cotta in the bottom of the pot to prevent the drainage holes from getting clogged up with soil. If you plan to keep the plant indoors, place a tray underneath the pot to collect the water that drains through the holes."

Create a \u201cwell\u201d in the soil mixture, place the plant\u2019s root ball into the well, and cover the root ball completely with the soil mixture. Look for cactus soil mix at any garden center. A crown of thorns plant can be grown directly in the ground if the soil is sandy and well-drained, and the climate is sunny and stays above 55 \u00b0F (13 \u00b0C) year-round.

Even if this isn\u2019t possible in your case, aim to give the plant as much sunlight as possible. Ample direct sunlight can, however, heat up a windowsill beyond the plant\u2019s preferred temperature range of 60\u201396 \u00b0F (16\u201336 \u00b0C).

If, however, the temperature in full sunshine often rises above 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) where you live, choose a spot that gets only partial sunlight\u20144 hours or less per day.

Choose a spot in your home that meets the recommended indoor growing conditions and keep it there until the temperature consistently warms up again. As a temporary measure on a chilly night, move the pot into a garage or cover it with a towel or sheet.

Grasp the plant near the base of the stem and pull the entire root ball up and out of the old pot.

If, for example, the instructions say to use 4  fl oz (120 ml) of water for the mixture, use 8  fl oz (240 ml) instead. As a desert plant, the crown of thorns thrives in poor soil."

Contact a poison control center or doctor if you suspect a child has eaten crown of thorns leaves or flowers, and call your pet\u2019s veterinarian in the same scenario.

Put on thick gardening gloves and, as an extra safety measure, wear eye protection. Clean your tools thoroughly when you\u2019re finished as well. The viscous, milky ooze inside of the leaves and stems contains the plant\u2019s poison.
