By July, they're so close to the beaches and piers you should be able to catch them standing from the shore. In the summer and until the early fall, you can catch them on the flats and near the top of big bays."

If you see diving birds, chances are there will be a school of Spanish mackerel underneath. Look for diving birds around bays and inland waters in the summer months especially \u2013 although it\u2019s also common in spring and early autumn."

Trolling is a method of fishing where one or more fishing lines, baited with lures or bait, are drawn through the water. Stay on the outside of the school of fish, do not troll directly through it."

A metal lure will help you reach schools from most spots, including boats, bridges or piers. Metal lures are also able to better withstand the strong teeth of Spanish mackerel over time. If using natural bait, minnows and live shrimp are good options."

          "headline":"Cast your line far, and fast.",
          "description":"Although not large, Spanish mackerel are very swift, so you need to be fast to catch them. Cast your line far and quickly, and be prepared to set your hook fast when you locate your catch. Use high gear ratio tackle for fast retrieval. The faster retrieval will also come in handy when you need to get the lure in for another cast quickly before the school moves off again. Use conventional tackle if fishing from beaches and piers. Conventional tackle gives you a farther cast, and will help you reach schools that may otherwise seem just out of reach."
