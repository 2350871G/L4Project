All purpose dish soap works best. Squirt a small amount into your water bottle and then fill it with water. Use a sponge or towel to gently wipe the insides of the water bottle. You can also shake the bottle to help disperse the soap evenly inside your water bottle."

In this case, you can use a scrub brush with a long handle to scrub down the insides and remove an unwanted new smell. If there were any stickers or embellishments inside your water bottle at purchase, a scrub brush can be used to remove these items."

Mix one teaspoon of bleach with one gallon of water bottle with this solution. Let it sit for five to 15 minutes depending on the severity of the smell. Rinse the bottle thoroughly after letting it soak. It's very important to rinse it several times, as bleach is toxic. Allow the bottle to air dry before using it."
