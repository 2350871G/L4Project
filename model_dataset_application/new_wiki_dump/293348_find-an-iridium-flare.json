      "description":"An Iridium flare looks like a star that moves slowly and quickly brightens, then slowly fades away. If it looks elongated, leaves a visible trail, fades away in less than a second from becoming visible, or lasts more than a minute, it is most likely either a meteor, a fireball, or the ISS (International Space Station, which can also be found with similar methods). Azimuth - Measured clockwise around the observer's horizon from north; north has an azimuth of 0\u00b0, east 90\u00b0, south 180\u00b0 and west 270\u00b0. Altitude - Overhead is 90\u00b0, directly in front of you is 0\u00b0. Determining the correct altitude to watch is a bit more difficult than the azimuth, especially in the twilight before stars begin to appear, which is the usual time satellites are seen. A handy gauge is your fist held at arm's length - it is approximately 10\u00b0 'tall'. I prefer to also extend my index (pointer) and pinky fingers straight out (not 'splayed') to provide a better 0\u00b0 and 10\u00b0 gauging point. Place your extended pinky on the horizon in front of you, look up to your index finger & note where it is against the sky -- count \"10\". Keep your eyes on that spot, and shift your fist upwards until the pinky is where the index was - then up to the index's new position & count \"20\", & so on. Repeat until you've determined the correct angle - and of course, a 5\u00b0 (eg, 45\u00b0 etc.) position falls in the middle between the extended fingers. This 'gauge' is pretty accurate. You can continue up to 90\u00b0 & if that point is directly overhead, you're doing it correctly."
