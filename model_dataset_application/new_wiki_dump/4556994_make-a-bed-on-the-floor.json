Even if you only plan on having one person sleep on it, the twin is still quite small and may not offer enough room to spread out comfortably. Make sure to buy one that has an electric air pump. Many come with this built right into the mattress. Blowing up an air mattress yourself is arduous and time consuming. More expensive doesn\u2019t always mean better when it comes to an air mattress. Much of the comfort will come from how you set it up, so don\u2019t feel like you need to spend an arm and a leg. A decent full sized air mattress can be purchased for anywhere from $45 to $75 dollars."

This will act in place of a headboard and keep your pillows from falling back behind the bed in the night. You can also put the mattress up against some furniture like a couch or a regular bed. Keep the mattress away from drafty windows. Don\u2019t place it too close to a radiator.

By sewing some pillowcases together and stuffing them with pillows you should have a cushion long enough to accommodate your whole body. You\u2019ll need at least five pillowcases for this project, but depending on how tall you are and how big the pillowcases are, you may need to add more. Lay them out end to end on the floor and measure them to be sure you are making a pillowcase bed that is big enough. You can use pillowcases you have around the house or buy new ones from the store. They should be standard size and relatively sturdy. Consider going to a thrift store if you don\u2019t want to use the pillowcases in your house or buy brand new ones. Ask family and friends if they have any old pillowcases they would like to get rid of. You can also use a twin sized bed sheet. This will require a little extra sewing."

Repeat this process until all five pillow cases are connected edge to edge. Make sure all the open sides are facing the same way. Make sure you are always sewing on the same side. The side with the stitching will be the bottom, leaving the top looking clean. Always unfold the pillowcase bed after attaching each case.

Since you\u2019ll be putting more pressure on your pillow bed than a normal pillowcase, it will help to have something extra in place to keep the pillows from sliding out. If you are a little craftier you could also sew large buttons at the openings. Including a zipper would make it even more secure."
