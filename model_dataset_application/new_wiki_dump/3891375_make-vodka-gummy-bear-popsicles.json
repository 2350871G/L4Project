However, you can still enjoy the vodka soaked bears even if they don\u2019t make it into the popsicle mold. Keep soaking the bears in a cool, dry spot in the kitchen, preferably covered with plastic wrap. If you have curious pets who can jump on the counter, be on the safe side and keep these puppies well covered and away from interested cats, dogs or even kids."
