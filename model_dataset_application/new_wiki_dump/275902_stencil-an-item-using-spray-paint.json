Do not mix and match faux crackle paints with regular because they are not made to mix with other paints. They may refuse to dry and ruin your work when sprayed over or put under other paints. You will have enough variety without them, just using the stencils and your creative hand."

      "headline":"Hold the stencil as close as you can to the item.",
      "description":"Have a light touch with the spray paint. Spritz in short blasts till you know how your paint adheres. Some paints go on wet and sloppy and need lots of level drying time. But don't worry if they run or bleed into a mess. Just go right over it with another color and call it your own special design. This is where you might need cheap gloves to prevent your stencil-holding hand from being sprayed. Multiple stencils can be used on an item. If sprayed wet (before first coat has dried), do less spraying with the second color. Spraying when still wet creates a different effect as the colors swirl and affect each other. Of course, items sprayed can be left to totally dry between coats. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/85\\/IMG_3615_3.JPG\\/460px-IMG_3615_3.JPG\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/85\\/IMG_3615_3.JPG\\/760px-IMG_3615_3.JPG\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":378,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":624.0469208211143,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>Taken by kdweeb 0108,  Photo of Tin next to of the stencils used to spray paint it.\\n<\\/p><p>Image by: Uploader<br>\\nLicense: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"
