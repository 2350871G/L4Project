  "text":" Simple Butterfly Gather the materials you will need for this project, listed below.  Put a craft cloth or some newspaper down on your working surface.  Cut the top portion of the four spoons off (leaving about half an inch of the handle left.) The top portion is the flat spoon part. Using the cut-off handle of one of the spoons, make that the \"body\" of the butterfly.  Glue all four of the tops of the spoons to the back. Make sure you are careful when using the hot glue. Slant the top two wings about 45\u00b0 up and the bottom two 45\u00b0 down. Let dry. Decorate the wings. Glue fake jewels or add glitter to the \"spoon\" wings, or make pretty designs with the markers. Bigger Butterfly Repeat Steps 1 to 2 in the first method (the simple butterfly), but instead of using four spoons, do this to 12 spoons. You can also do it to more, just make sure the number of spoons is divisible by four. Use the handle of one of the spoons as the body again.  For the wings, glue three of the spoon tops together to create a wing shape. Do this with the other groups of three spoons. Let the glue dry, then attach the wing shaped spoon tops to the body. You can also use more spoon tops on the top or bottom of the butterfly to create different sized wings. For example, to have bigger top wings than bottom ones, you would have three spoons for each wing on the top and two spoons for each wing on the bottom. Decorate your butterfly with jewels, glitter, or sharpies as desired. You may also paint the spoons (make sure the paint can adhere to the plastic.) If you're going to paint the spoons, you will need a couple coats of paint so the butterfly will look bright \u2014 so there won't be any streaky bits of plastic showing.",
