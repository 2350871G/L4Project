          "description":"A messy house will look smaller than a clean house because clutter reduces visible floor and wall space. Ideally, each shelf, table, desk, or other furniture item should have some empty space on it. For example, you could place a single book on a coffee table in your living room, or a single vase on a dresser, or a single clay sculpture on a bookshelf. To declutter a room, try setting up 3 boxes: 1 for items to keep, 1 for items to donate, and 1 for items to throw away."

          "description":"If your furniture is taking up most of the floor space in a room, moving it around can make a big difference. Move each of the pieces so that there will be more visible floor space around them. Some options for arranging your furniture include:\nMoving your furniture to the center of a room if you only have a few small or medium sized items. For example, you could move a few chairs to the center of the room so that they are gathered around a coffee table. This will open up the space around the backs of the chairs. Placing larger furniture pieces at angles if you can\u2019t arrange them another way. For example, you could turn your bed or sofa so it is at an angle to a wall. Moving furniture to the sides of the room if you want more space to walk through. For example, you could push your sofa and chairs in the living room to the perimeters of the room. Taking 1 or more pieces of furniture out of a room if there is very little floor or wall space. For example, you could take 1 seldom used chair out of the living room, or remove the nightstands from your bedroom."

Typically, small rooms should be painted a neutral or bright color to appear larger, as this will help reflect light around the space.
