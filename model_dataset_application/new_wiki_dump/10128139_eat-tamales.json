          "description":"Simply peel back one end of the wrapper (typically a corn husk or plantain leaf) and start munching. Once you\u2019re done, toss the wrapper in the trash and continue going about your day. Tamales were originally meant to be eaten as a handheld food, the way you might nibble a sandwich or bagel wrapped in deli paper. Look for tamales being sold as street fare in places with a strong Mexican heritage, or anywhere that food trucks tend to be spotted. Their size and portability makes them perfect for scarfing down on the go. Never eat the wrapper itself."

          "description":"Unwrap the tamale and discard the wrapper. Then, throw it on a plate and cut it into bite-sized pieces. That way, you won\u2019t have to hold it the whole time you\u2019re eating or worry about getting your hands dirty. Be sure to remove the wrapper entirely from tamales steamed in corn husks. While plantain leaves are edible (though they\u2019re not usually consumed with the tamales), corn husks aren\u2019t, and could cause choking or an upset stomach if swallowed. Cutting up tamales makes them easier to feed to children, who might make a mess if trusted with the entire portion."

          "description":"Top savory tamales with tangy tomato salsa or salsa verde. Mole, a Mexican sauce made from chocolate, chile peppers, and spices, can also be used to spice up an otherwise plain tamale. Pour your condiment of choice directly onto the unwrapped tamale or dip it to control how much you get with each bite. Feel free to substitute your own favorite salsa recipes, such as black bean and corn, mango-habanero, or chunky pico de gallo. If you don\u2019t have any salsa handy, ordinary hot sauce can make an acceptable substitute."

It's not uncommon to find sweet tamales on the dessert menu at restaurants that specialize in tamales. Sweet tamales are often flavored with potent spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and cardamom, and may be finished with a spritz of whipped cream or a drizzle of honey."

          "headline":"Reheat leftover tamales before enjoying them.",
          "description":"If you have a few extra tamales sitting in the refrigerator, there are a number of ways to warm them up without losing that soft, tender texture. Try steaming them in a pot of boiling water using a steamer basket, or throw them into the oven or a hot pan with a little bit of cooking oil for a slightly crispy finish. You can also microwave tamales as a last resort if you have no other options available. Sticking a small glass of water in with them will help keep them from drying out and becoming crumbly. It's not strictly necessary to reheat your tamales before chowing down. While they're most often eaten hot and fresh from the pot, there's no rule that says you can't enjoy them cold!"

It is often sipped alongside tamales, making it a perfect addition to your meal. Freshly-brewed atole is often available at restaurants and food stands that sell tamales.

It is prepared by boiling long-grain white rice with milk and cinnamon sticks until it takes on a custard-like consistency. Refrigerate the pudding to help it thicken and serve it chilled.

A Mother-in-Law may be served in a bun, but when fully-loaded, it\u2019s anything but a finger food. Be sure to have plenty of napkins nearby!"
