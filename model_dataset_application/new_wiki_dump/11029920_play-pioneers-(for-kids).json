Depending on your age and preference, the length of your dress will vary. For this game, pick a dress you already have, but keep it plain."

Options include:\nUnderdrawers, similar to underwear these days. They are a bit different, but you can use your actual underwear for this game. Corsets, if you are older than 13, probably. If you are not comfortable using a corset, or are typical to being light-headed and fainting, you may skip no matter your age. Petticoats or hoops, which were worn under skirts to make them look more poofy. If you have a tutu you like, use that; it has mostly the same effect."

In these places, they wore sunbonnets, which are similar to our modern day caps. These blocked the sun with their stiff, sticking out part. For this game, just wear a plain hat that might look like a real bonnet or wear a cap to model a sunbonnet."
