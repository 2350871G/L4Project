      "description":"To make your spiral wire bead ring, you'll need sterling silver filled or non-tarnish silver wire (which won't turn your finger green). Purchase a 16 or 14 gauge roll of wire, and make sure it's half hard. For this ring, start with about 12 inches (30.5 cm) of wire. If you want to practice on cheaper wire, buy copper or nickel. You'll also need a bead with a hole in the center, wire cutters and needle-nose pliers."

If you see the spiral start to puff up, use a small block of wood and press gently but firmly on the spiral to push it against the bead as you turn the wires. Continue spiraling until the desired size is achieved. Be sure to leave a tail of at least 2\" (5 cm) on each wire to complete. Remove the ring from the mandrel or dowel."
