There is also less risk of fungal infections at this time of the year because the bark is more easily damaged while the trees are growing."

          "description":"The tools used for pruning conifers should always be sharp, as this is safer and more effective. You can determine which type of tool to use based on the size of the branches being pruned. If the branches are less than \u00bd-inch thick, use hand or bypass pruners that cut with a scissor action. If the branches are larger than \u00bd-inch thick but less than 1 \u20442 inches (3.8 cm) in diameter, use loppers or lopping shears. When the branches are more than 1 \u20442 inches (3.8 cm) in diameter, use a pruning saw. Hedge clippers or shears can be used to shape conifers that are grown as a hedge or maintained in a particular shape."

You can also trim the branches back to neaten the conifer up, if necessary. Remove entire branches to thin out overly-thick growth, if necessary, and open the interior of the conifer up for better sun exposure and air circulation. Branches that are growing at angles will also need to be removed. Choose the branches carefully, though. Once an entire branch is removed from either a tree or shrub conifer, it will not grow back."

For instance, pine trees have a leader, or main stem, that can be reduced to a 10 inch (25.4 cm) stub in order to produce a stockier, more compact tree. The side branches at top should be trimmed until they are about 5 inches (12.7 cm) shorter than the top branch. The downward limbs can be pruned in decreasing increments to form a pyramid-like overall shape. Branches on Douglas fir trees that are over 5 inches (12.7 cm) around should not be pruned, because this puts the plants at a great risk for fungal infections."

Gardeners should wait for a period of dry weather to trim ailing trees because this will reduce the spread of pathogens. It's also important to clean and sterilize the pruners with a household disinfectant before and after each use to help reduce the spread of disease. Use a rag to wipe the disinfectant off the pruners before using them again, as disinfectant can cause damage to the tree.
