You should plan the size of your ship so you can calculate the amount of material you need, for the ship in the illustrations, 2 inch (5.1 cm) thick foam was used, and a piece of scrap 16 inches (40.6 cm) wide and 6 feet (1.8 m) long was used. Draw the basic shape of your pirate ship on a sheet of paper, noting the length, height, and width so you can transfer these dimensions to the foam sheet. Add whatever details that need to be sculpted from the foam so they can be cut out, such as the prow, forecastle, main deck and aftercastle, if you want.
