      "description":"Door sweeps work fairly well but tiny mice can squeeze in at the ends of the door sweep. Strengthen the ends of your door sweep by putting an additional wood screw at the end. Additionally, strengthen the door sweep by using rubber cement, or even paper glue, to bond the lower part, usually made of rubber or felt, to the metal upper part. If possible, mount the door sweep at the exterior of the door, because if it is mounted on the interior, a space is created under the door that a big roach will naturally hide under. Sometimes a door sweep may fit better mounted on the interior side of the door and that hiding space is created. If you live in an older home and the flooring is uneven, the door sweep might get pinched between the door and the floor, and break. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/76\\/Make-an-Uneven-Door-Threshold-out-of-Cardboard-to-Keep-Critters-Out-Step-1Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Make-an-Uneven-Door-Threshold-out-of-Cardboard-to-Keep-Critters-Out-Step-1Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/76\\/Make-an-Uneven-Door-Threshold-out-of-Cardboard-to-Keep-Critters-Out-Step-1Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-760px-Make-an-Uneven-Door-Threshold-out-of-Cardboard-to-Keep-Critters-Out-Step-1Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nDoor thresholds decreases the gaps under doors, but not perfectly, and they work well with a door sweep.
