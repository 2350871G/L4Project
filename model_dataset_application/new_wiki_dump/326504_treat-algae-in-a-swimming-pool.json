Collect some water from the pool and test the pH levels with a test kit. To lower the pH, add some muriatic acid or sodium bisulphate. To increase the pH, add sodium carbonate. The ideal pH for pool water is between 7.2 and 7.6."

The intensity of the shock will depend on how much algae there is:\nFor light green algae, double shock the pool by adding 2 pounds (907 g) of shock per 10,000 gallons (37,854 L) of water\nFor dark green algae, triple shock the pool by adding 3 pounds (1.36 kg) of shock per 10,000 gallons (37,854 L) of water\nFor black-green algae, quadruple shock the pool by adding 4 pounds (1.81 kg) of shock per 10,000 gallons (37,854 L) of water"

Follow the manufacturer's directions to determine how much to add based on the size of your pool. After adding the algaecide, let it sit for about 24 hours. An ammonia-based algaecide will be cheaper and should work with a basic green algae bloom. Copper-based algaecides are more expensive, but they're also more effective, especially if you have other types of algae in your pool as well. Copper based algaecides do tend to cause staining in some pools and are the main cause of \u201cgreen hair\u201d when using a pool."
