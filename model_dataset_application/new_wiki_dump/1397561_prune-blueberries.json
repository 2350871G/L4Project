Pruning an Older Blueberry Bush Know when to prune. Prune over the winter. You can prune as early as November or as late as March. However, the best time to prune is late February to the beginning of March. This time of year is best because you can see which new buds will produce fruit (fat buds) and which ones will produce leaves (flat buds). Use a pair of sharp shears, loppers, a pair of gloves, and disinfectant in a bucket. When cutting, always use a pair of sharp shears. Dull shears can cause you to use too much pressure, which can lead to injury. It will also make cutting more difficult and may damage your plant. Wear the gloves while pruning to protect your hands. Begin with diseased branches. Cut any canes that have diseases on them first. Look for shriveled branches or discolored branches. Dip the shears in disinfectant. Between bushes, dip the shears into the disinfectant to stop the spread of disease. Shake off the disinfectant before moving on to the next bush. You can also use a rag or towel that has been soaked in rubbing alcohol. Wipe down the shears to disinfect them. Prune out damaged canes.
