          "description":"WD-40 will break down most general types of adhesive and clean them off of nearly all surfaces. For example, spray WD-40 on jars to remove the adhesive remnants of the labels or masking tape, or use it to remove the adhesive from stickers on glass or plastic surfaces. WD-40 can also loosen and remove gum and rubber cement from surfaces they have been stuck to. Spray WD-40 directly onto the unwanted adhesive, and use a rag or old toothbrush to remove the substance. WD-40 will even work to clean gum, oil, or dog poop off of the soles of your shoes. In any of these cases, spray WD-40 directly onto the adhesive substance, and then scrub vigorously with an old, unused toothbrush."

          "description":"New or unused leather shoes that have not been worn recently are often inflexible and can be uncomfortable to slide your foot into or wear for a day. You can use WD-40 to soften the leather and make the shoes comfortable to wear. To soften the leather, spray WD-40 generously over the leather material, and rub the material into the shoe with a clean, dry cloth. An application of WD-40 will also soften any other leather items, from dog collars to baseball gloves. WD-40 can also be used to clean scuff marks off of the tops and sides of shoes. Black scuff marks build up from normal use and wear (including from the shoes bumping together as you walk). To remove scuffs, spray the marked area with WD-40 and buff with a dry cloth."

          "description":"As WD-40 is grease-resistant and can break down stubborn adhesives in general, it can even be used to remove grease stains from clothing. To remove the stain, hold the plastic extension tube only about \u00bd inch away from the stain, and spray liberally to saturate the area. Then wash the piece of clothing in a regular cycle. Before drying the clothing, make sure that the stain has been removed. Drying\u2014especially on medium or high heat\u2014can set the stain and make it impossible to get out. If the stain has not been removed after an initial application of WD-40, repeat the application and wash again."

If this is the case, spray WD-40 directly onto the joint between the two blades of the shears. Slowly work the handles back and forth to allow the WD-40 to soak in. If your garden shears continue to not open\u2014or to open only with difficulty\u2014loosen the screw or bolt at the intersection of the blades, and spray some WD-40 between the sections of metal that rub together to lubricate.

If you\u2019re worried about unused tools or metal appliances developing rust, spray with WD-40 to prevent the rust from building up. Hold the tip of the plastic extension tube 2\u20133 inches from the metal surface you\u2019d like to keep from rusting, and coat the metal with a thin layer of fluid. This is useful for a number of outdoor gardening and lawn supplies. Apply WD-40 to your shovel, rake, hoe, saws and saw blades, as well as any outdoor appliances that are exposed to wet or humid weather."

WD-40 makes several bicycle-specific products for use on various parts of your bike. These include a general de-greaser, chain lubricant, and frame protectant. When possible, use bicycle-specific WD-40 products on your equipment. These products should be available at your local bike-supply shop, a hardware store, or from various online bicycle-focused retailers."

Hold the tip of the plastic extension tube about 1 inch away from the tiles or sections of grout that you wish to clean, and spray liberally.

Other stains build up on these bathroom amenities as well, including some that may be left behind by other cleaning supplies. You can remove these by spraying WD-40 directly onto the stain, and then and then scrub vigorously with your toilet brush (or a sponge). You should not use WD-40 to replace regular toilet cleaner, as WD-40 cannot kill germs and bacteria. Rather, only use WD-40 to remove specific stains that general toilet cleaner can\u2019t remove.
