          "description":"The two best ways to cook chicken for chili are by either simmering in a pan or by boiling. These methods will help retain their moisture so they're not too tough when you later add them to the rest of the ingredients. To simmer chicken, put about 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of extra-virgin olive oil in a 12-inch frying pan and heat on medium. As it warms up, lightly salt and pepper each side of the chicken breasts, place them top down in the pan and cook for 5 minutes until they are golden brown on the top. Flip the breasts, add \u20444 cup (180 ml) water, cover and simmer over medium-high for 7-10 minutes. Make a small slice in the middle of each to check for any pink. If not, they\u2019re done! To boil chicken, fill a medium-to-large pot about halfway with water and add the chicken breasts. Turn the burner to medium-high heat until the water starts boiling. Reduce the heat until the water is simmering and cover with a tight lid. Cook for about 15-20 minutes. Again, check to make sure they are fully cooked by slicing into them to ensure there is no pink in the center."

          "description":"Dicing onions isn\u2019t the most pleasant task. In fact, it often reduces one to tears, but here are the basic steps. First peel off the outer, papery skin, and then place the onion on its side on a cutting board. Cut off the top of the onion (where the stem is), and then turn it so it\u2019s sitting on the flat surface created from cutting off its top. Now cut it in half. Take one of the halves, lay it flat-side down and cut \u20444 inch (6.4 mm) slices lengthwise toward but not all the way through the end, or root, so the onion doesn\u2019t fall apart. Turn the onion and cut \u20444 inch (6.4 mm) slices perpendicular to the ones before, and the pieces will start to break away. Do the same for the other half of the onion."

          "description":"After about 6-8 hours, or when you get home from work, for instance, open the crock pot, remove a chicken breast and slice into the middle to make sure it\u2019s not pink. The chicken should also be very tender. Aside from the time convenience of cooking with a crockpot, there\u2019s also a nutritional advantage as well. Because a crockpot cooks at a low heat level, it doesn\u2019t suck out all the vitamins and minerals in food. As for chili, crockpots are a great solution because the longer you let chili cook, the more flavorful it will become. It also takes the heat out of cooking chili in the summer since you\u2019re not standing over a hot pot, stirring for a couple of hours. You don\u2019t even have to be at home while your food essentially cooks itself."

The quickest way to do this is by putting them in a pan of cool water for a few minutes. Once they\u2019ve cooled down, you\u2019re ready to proceed. There are a couple of ways you can go about shredding. You can pull the chicken apart with your hands and place the shredded pieces on a plate. You can hold a breast with either one hand or with a fork and use another fork to tear the chicken into pieces and place the pieces on a plate."

Also wash, dry and prepare your cilantro.You can either top your chili with whole leaves, or you can top it with chopped cilantro. To chop cilantro, simply gather the bunch in your hand and begin chopping from the flowering tops toward the roots. Only chop off as much as you think you will use.

Turn the cutting board and cut straight strips about 1 inch (25 mm) apart across the width of the breast. Lightly salt and pepper the cubed chicken."

          "description":"These three ingredients will take some time to prepare as they require mincing, dicing and de-seeding, but the kick they\u2019ll give your chili will be well worth the effort. Dice the onion as you did for the crockpot chicken chili recipe. To mince garlic, you must first pick off a clove from the bulb and peel it. Start by laying the flat side of the clove on a cutting board. Take a wide-blade knife, hold the handle with one hand and lay either of the flat sides of the knife on top of the clove. Push down hard with the heel of your hand to smash the clove, which will allow you to easily take off the peeling. Now lay the clove on one of its flat sides on a chopping board, cut off both ends and cut the clove in thin strips lengthwise, or from root to tip. Turn it 90 degrees and cut strips in the opposite direction, which will form a pile of garlic. Put the tip of the knife on the cutting board and, using a rocking motion, move the heel of the knife in different directions as you cut into the pile. And Voil\u00e0! Minced garlic. To de-seed and mince jalapeno peppers, first consider wearing a pair of gloves! Next, cut the stem off the pepper, slice it in half lengthwise, take a spoon and scoop out the seeds. Now, cut very thin, or roughly \u204416 inch (1.6 mm) lengthwise slices. Take the slices, turn them crossways and make very small cuts across."

          "description":"While the chili is cooking, you will want to get the bacon prepared. There are three ways to do this: pan fry it, cook it in the oven or microwave it. To pan fry bacon, lay out the slices so that they don\u2019t overlap but still fill up the pan. You want enough slices in the pan to produce plenty of grease. Otherwise, they\u2019re likely to burn. If you overlap them, they won\u2019t cook evenly. Turn the burner to medium heat and let them cook for several minutes before flipping. Once they are crispy enough for you, use a fork or spatula to remove them from the pan and put them on a paper towel-covered plate to soak up the grease. To cook bacon in the oven, pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees. Lay out the slices in the pan horizontally and don\u2019t overlap them. Cook them for about 10-15 minutes, flipping once. To cook bacon in the microwave, put 3 layers of paper towels on a plate and lay the slices side-by-side across the plate. Cover them with another paper towel. The total cook time depends upon microwave wattage and whether or not there\u2019s a rotating tray, so you will just have to go slow and watch it."

Heat a saucepan deep enough for soup over medium or medium-high heat for a few minutes, or until the pan is quite hot.
