      "headline":"Turn your microphone off.",
      "description":"Most gaming servers have rules against shouting or cursing over voice communication channels. If you're having issues maintaining your composure, it's best to mute your microphone so that you may shout and tell everyone how bad of a job they're doing without actually letting them hear it!"
    },
    {
      "headline":"Don't take other players seriously.",
      "description":"Occasionally, in some games, you may find yourself playing against (or with) someone who is getting on your nerves. Whether it's because they are gloating after a win against you or because they are simply trying to annoy everyone (trolling), don't take what they say seriously. Some people are more competitive than others, others have thicker skins and are not particularly sensitive to name-calling. Relax, take a deep breath, and let what they say roll off of your back. Remember that most people would act in an entirely different way if you had encountered them face-to-face rather than on the Internet. If you find yourself tempted to take what other players are saying seriously, mute them. Sometimes, the best way to walk away from an unproductive conversation is to simply ignore the other person. If you find yourself frequently letting others' words bring out the worst in you, perhaps you should consider disabling voice chat altogether."

    {
      "headline":"Switch servers.",
      "description":"If you find yourself losing a lot on one server, it may be best to try your luck on another server and play there. You could also try switching to the winning team, although most servers have rules against this (called \"team stacking\") and may switch you back to the losing team."

      "headline":"Play with a friend.",

      "headline":"Rage quit.",

    },
    {
      "headline":"Remember that it's just a game.",
      "description":"Yeah, everyone says this, but it's absolutely vital to remember that playing a video game is for fun and entertainment. The number of kills you have, the number of wins you have, and your kill-death ratio will not contribute to anything else in your life except for bragging rights."
