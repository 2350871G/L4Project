      "description":"This will help you know what you need to trade for before attempting to get one. A founders' hat is worth 2 good long collars, either 2 blue, 2 purple, 2 red, or a mix, depending on the Jammer. Founders' hats, more accurately however, are worth 2 purple longs, though some people would like to get rid of their founders' hat fast or they want the most value for it possible, hence you may see some Jammers asking for blue longs or red longs. However, demand is low, which decreases an item's rarity slightly. So it's best if you avoid trading two red longs since technically it's an overtrade, and instead, go for two purple longs or a purple and a red long."

      "description":"If you don't already have the worth of a Founders' Hat, begin by getting a few small rares such as clothing betas, rare nature items, etc. Trade these items for den betas or rarer items if you're lucky such as spiked collars. You can obtain these small items through a number of ways - if you're non member, play the hard modes of adventures such as Return of the Phantoms and The Phantom Portal and grind these adventures to get as many clothing betas as you can. If you're member, try doing the Forgotten Desert over and over again to try to get small rares or even rarer items such as long collars. If you're non member and you want to get rares faster from land adventures, try creating 3 other backup accounts to use with your main so that if you get a good item from one chest, you can get it again from each of your backup accounts. If you get a bad item from a chest, you can still use your other accounts to test the other two clothing chests, so you can get 2 to 4 good items from these adventures at once. Plus, if you have a member account or friend to help you, you can open the animal passages within the adventure and have more chances at getting rare items with your backups. In total, you have 8 chances at getting good items if you're using your main and 3 backups. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/e4\\/Screen-Shot-2020-01-19-at-8.11.29-PM.png\\/460px-Screen-Shot-2020-01-19-at-8.11.29-PM.png\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/e4\\/Screen-Shot-2020-01-19-at-8.11.29-PM.png\\/759px-Screen-Shot-2020-01-19-at-8.11.29-PM.png\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":281,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":463.5164835164835,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Fair_use\\\">Fair Use<\\/a> (screenshot)<br>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nGrinding the Forgotten Desert is a great way to begin if you're member.

      "description":"A Founders' Hat is worth 2 good longs, usually 2 purple longs or a purple and a red long, depending on the Jammer. Try to avoid trading 2 red longs because this is considered over since a Founders' Hat has low demand. However, if you're having trouble finding a Jammer who wants otherwise, you can trade for 2 red longs and then trade those for the Founders' Hat if you want. Avoid aiming for blue longs - people rarely want the lowest good long for items as they are hard to trade away unless you add a large over to the blue long, which will eat away at your rarity instead of helping you work up to your goals or getting profit. Trade your den betas directly for red or purple longs. Don't trade your den betas for small spikes and then trade those spikes for longs. This is why it is recommended to save up 40 den betas, unless you can trade other shorts, neon bows, or other good items for these longs already, and you can add den betas as needed. The reason why you should not trade for smaller spikes first is because you'll be trading more den betas or items than you need to. A red long is worth 23 to 25 den betas. If you trade 16 den betas for 2 pink longs, this will add up to 32 den betas. Trading those pink longs for a red long means you'll have traded an extra 12 den betas for the long for nothing. This is just the way to rarity system is built in the game, so make smart choices when you're trading small base items like den betas and clothing betas. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/b0\\/Screen-Shot-2020-01-19-at-8.20.01-PM.png\\/460px-Screen-Shot-2020-01-19-at-8.20.01-PM.png\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/b0\\/Screen-Shot-2020-01-19-at-8.20.01-PM.png\\/760px-Screen-Shot-2020-01-19-at-8.20.01-PM.png\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":273,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":450.989010989011,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Fair_use\\\">Fair Use<\\/a> (screenshot)<br>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nUse other items, if you have any, directly for purple or red longs as well.

If you can find someone who wants two blue longs for their Founders' Hat, that's even better. Make the trade once you negotiate, if necessary. People usually want over trades. If someone wants two purple longs and wants you to add a few den betas, that's okay since you are trading for something with a higher rarity than two good longs. Try to avoid overtrading by anymore than a decent short collar for this item however, since this item is in low demand and shouldn't be worth anymore than its established rarity. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/08\\/Screen-Shot-2020-01-19-at-8.24.09-PM.png\\/460px-Screen-Shot-2020-01-19-at-8.24.09-PM.png\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/08\\/Screen-Shot-2020-01-19-at-8.24.09-PM.png\\/759px-Screen-Shot-2020-01-19-at-8.24.09-PM.png\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":271,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":447.85714285714283,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Fair_use\\\">Fair Use<\\/a> (screenshot)<br>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}",
