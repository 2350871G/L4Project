If there is no battery box on the back of the clock, a small rectangular hole in an indented rectangle is a good sign of a battery pack. If there is no battery inside your clock, most battery packs have embossed letters inside the battery spaces telling you what size batteries to get."

          "description":"You can figure out how the dials work by experimenting. Turn the dials, and then see what happens on the face of the clock. You should choose a dial and put your fingers on it firmly. Then turn the clock around so that you can see the hands moving, and turn the dial to figure out which hand it is connected to. There are a number of variables that can affect the function of the dials, so try to experiment: turn them both directions, and lift them or pull them out to see if this changes which hand engages. Some clocks will use one dial for each hand. Other clocks will have one dial that moves both hands. There may also be a dial to set an alarm, which is usually a smaller hand that is a different color than the other ones."

You can find watch batteries at Radio Shack or Walmart, or you may want to take your watch back to the place that you bought it for a professional fix. You can potentially scratch your watch if you try to replace your battery yourself. However, if you do want to pry off the back of your watch, you can do so with a small flat-head jeweler\u2019s screwdriver. Insert the tip of the screwdriver into the indentation or tab that separates the front and back of your watch. Tap it with a hammer or rubber mallet until the back comes off. You should then be able to replace the battery (use a non-metal object to remove and replace the battery) and the back of the watch. If your watch is solar powered or movement powered, you may need to charge it in the sun, or wear it for a day or two before it is ready to set."
