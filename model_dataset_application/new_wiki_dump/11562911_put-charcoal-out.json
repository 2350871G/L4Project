          "description":"Wear heat-proof gloves while handling your grill to protect your hands from getting burned. Close the lid and any vents your grill has to prevent any air from getting to the coals. For a fire pit, place the lid over the opening. This will cause the fire to burn itself out. Shut your grill down right away after cooking. Charcoal takes a long time to cool down and it can be dangerous to leave it open. Do not pour water on your grill to cool it down faster. The dramatic change in temperature can cause your grill to crack, and the water will mix with the ashes and harden, making it much more difficult to clean out."

          "description":"Use a pair of tongs to take out the briquettes or large chunks of charcoal. Then use an ash removal bucket to scoop out most of the ashes. Some grills will cool down within 24-36 hours. However, since it can be hard to tell if the coals are still burning, it's safest to wait a full 48 hours. All-wood charcoal typically takes longer to cool down. Charcoal briquettes can cool down in 24 hours. Coals aren't fully out until they are cool to the touch."

Clean out the inside of the grill or fire pit thoroughly by scrubbing it with a wire brush. Spend extra time cleaning the area around the vents of a grill, since ash can build up there. To keep your grill in good working condition, use a silicone spray to lubricate the vents."

Leave it on a non-flammable surface in the sun, such as pavement, until it is cool and dry to the touch. This is most effective for wood charcoal rather than briquettes. Briquettes are usually spent after cooking with them once. The charcoal may take slightly longer or shorter to dry out. Check that it is completely dry before putting it away.
