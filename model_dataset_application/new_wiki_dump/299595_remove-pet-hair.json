The rubber will collect the hair on the couch, making it easy to pick up. Run a vacuum over it when you're done with the squeegee for easy cleanup. This will also work on carpet."

Rub the glove lightly over the fabric, and it will easily pick up pet hair. If the glove gets clogged with hair, run it under water to clean it and begin again. You can also use a spray bottle to lightly spritz the glove."

Wipe down the furniture with a clean dryer sheet from your laundry room, which will make picking up pet hair a breeze. The dryer sheet has enough fabric softener in it that it will grab the hair.
