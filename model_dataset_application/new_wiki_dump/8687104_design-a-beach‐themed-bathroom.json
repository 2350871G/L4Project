          "description":"Cool tones, such as blue, green, and teal are perfect for a beach themed bathroom. These colours create the feel of water and can help to complement some beach themed trinkets and decor. You can use the colours on the walls or in the floor and shower tiles. Try pairing green or blue walls with white trim. Alternatively, you could pair the wall colour with beige or sandy coloured countertops."

For instance, try painting the walls navy blue and then complimenting that with white trim, white countertops, and white fixtures. You could also achieve a nautical look with navy blue and white striped wallpaper. Or, use shiplap on the walls for a beachy feel. You could also whitewash your cabinets for a natural beach wood look."

For example, you could paint the walls white or grey and then create a tropical feel by selecting bright pink and yellow towels. Alternatively, you could gain a tropical feel by using patterned wall paper or shower curtains that contain palm trees or tropical flowers. Or, choose a bright, solid-colored wallpaper or paint for the walls and add subtle accents and accessories for a modern look."

For example, perhaps you have a favourite picture of the ocean or sunset. Frame the picture and then build your decor around that piece. Alternatively, you may have an old bathing suit that you love. Place the suit in a frame and create a fun powder room around your old beachwear!

For instance, fill a glass jar with small shells and pebbles from the beach. Alternatively, you could place a larger artifact, such as a piece of driftwood or coral on a shelf with towels or other bathroom essentials.
