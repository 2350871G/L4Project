  "text":" Splitting the chilli pod Wear kitchen gloves. Split the chilli pod lengthwise with a knife. Using the same knife, discard all the seeds and veins from the pod. Remember to remove the part where the seed attaches to the pepper through a white thread like structure, as it is the hottest. Use the colourful chilli pod whole. It can be added diced or in julienne pieces, as required for the recipe. Using whole chilli pods For recipes that require boiling, tempering or stir frying, wash the chillies thoroughly with warm water.  Throw the washed chillies in whole in your dish.  Once the boiling, tempering or stir frying is completed, pick the chillies out of your dish with the help of a fork. This method ensures that you get a hint of chilli flavour in your dish but not the heat of the actual chilli pods. For mild to moderate pepper flavour When you want mild to moderate pepper flavour in your dish, poke holes in the chilli pods using a toothpick and add them to a half cooked dish.  Remove the chillies from your dish with the help of a fork, once you finish cooking. ",
