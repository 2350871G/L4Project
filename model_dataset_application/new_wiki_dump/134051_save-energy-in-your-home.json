          "headline":"Replace incandescent bulbs.",
          "description":"Incandescent light bulbs create lots of heat as well as light, and this makes them very inefficient. Replacing old incandescent bulbs in your house with compact fluorescent or LED ones will reduce the amount of energy you use on lighting by up to 75 percent. Lighting needs account for roughly 10 percent of your energy use. A single CFL bulb could save you about $30 in energy costs over the course of its life compared to an incandescent bulb."

          "headline":"Turn down your water heater.",
          "description":"Older tank-style water heaters use a lot of energy keeping the water in the tank hot. In fact, your water heater may account for up to a quarter of your energy use. To reduce the amount of energy your water heater uses, set the temperature of the water to 120 F (49 C). Don\u2019t set your water heater any lower than 120 F (49 C), as this can allow dangerous pathogens to thrive in your water tank. You'll save energy by turning down the water heater regardless of whether you have a gas or electric appliance, because it requires a lot of energy to produce the gas you use in your house. You can also make your water heater more efficient by covering it with an insulating blanket, and by adding insulating sleeves to the pipes."

          "headline":"Seal leaks and drafts.",
          "description":"Keeping your house at a comfortable temperature requires a great deal of energy. Leaks and drafts around the house that let outside air in and climate controlled air out further increase the amount of energy it takes to heat or cool your house. Therefore, you can save energy by sealing your home properly:\nInstall weather stripping on doors, windows, and attic or crawl space access holes. Seal up mail slots that don\u2019t get used. Seal openings and cracks in the roof, walls, around electrical outlets, and around pipes and wires with expanding caulk or foam. Plug large holes, such as by using a foam product. Install plastic sheeting on drafty windows, or use thick curtains to block drafts."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Increase insulation around the house.",
          "description":"Insulation will also help keep your house at a comfortable temperature without your furnace or air conditioner having to work too hard. Go around your house and check the insulation thickness, especially in the basement and attic. In areas where the insulation is less than 12 inches (30 cm) thick, add extra batt insulation to reduce drafts and leaks. You can also blow in the insulation to get a better layer. This option is also more reasonably priced. A common standard for insulation is an R-value of 30. For air conditioners a higher BTU unit will require more energy to run. Be aware that \"peak hours\" can increase your energy usage, therefore costing more."

          "headline":"Upgrade to energy-efficient appliances.",
          "description":"Older appliances tend to use a lot more energy than modern ones, and energy-efficient appliances will use the least energy possible. When it comes time to replace old appliances, look for the Energy Star rating or another energy-efficiency seal of approval. Energy Star appliances use up to 50 percent less energy and water than their traditional counterparts. Front-loading washing machines are more energy-efficient than top-loading ones\nRefrigerators with the freezer on top or the bottom are more energy-efficient than side-by-side refrigerator-freezers\nStoves with ceramic induction cooktops are more energy-efficient than traditional range cooktops\nTankless on-demand water heaters are much more energy-efficient than tank-style water heaters"

          "headline":"Install energy-efficient windows.",
          "description":"A large percentage of your energy may be lost through bad windows and doors. Older windows are often very drafty, and this means your furnace and air conditioner have to work harder to heat or cool your house, and this means using more energy. When it\u2019s time to update your windows, look into more energy-efficient double- or triple-paned ones that will help reduce your energy use. In many places, there are tax credits available for homeowners who upgrade to energy-efficient windows, so look into government programs where you live."

          "description":"Using your oven is great if you're cooking an entire meal. But if you're just roasting a few vegetables, making toast, or making another small meal, use food-specific appliances that use less energy. For instance:\nUse a toaster to make toast\nUse a toaster oven to cook, roast or bake small portions\nUse a steamer or rice cooker to steam rice and vegetables\nUse a frying pan to saut\u00e9 or stir fry instead of baking or roasting\nUse a microwave to bake, steam, and boil all sorts of foods"

You can save energy by turning off lights when you leave a room, turning off the television and radio when you're done watching or listening, and putting your computer into sleep or hibernate mode when you leave the room. When you go away for overnight or longer, unplug all appliances and electronics, because many of them use energy even when they're not on. To make your job easier, use power strips for appliances that are often used together, such as the TV, stereo, and DVD player. Unplug phone chargers and other devices when you're not using them too, because they draw power as long as they're plugged in. Cut down on the Phantom Loads. Some appliances and electronic devices continue to consume energy even when they are not in use. This is commonly referred to as the Phantom Load. It is usually caused when electronics are still plugged in or are not turned off. You can ensure that you stop wasting energy and your money by unplugging your electronics or by turning off the power strip where the devices are plugged in."

Finding ways to save water at home, therefore, can help you conserve energy. Some quick ways to save water include:\nTaking shorter showers\nTurning off taps when you're lathering up\nFilling the sink with water to wash dishes rather than letting it run\nSaving kitchen water for the garden\nReusing cooking water\nFlushing less\nInvesting in water-smart fixtures and faucets\nCapturing condensation from your air conditioning unit and using it to water plants."

To save even more water with the washing machine, always choose the appropriate load size so the machine will adjust the water level.

Heating the water accounts for about 90 percent of the energy a washing machine uses when you run a load on hot. Reserve hot water cycles for extremely soiled loads of laundry, but set the rinse cycle so it uses cold water."

To take advantage of this, plant deciduous trees on the south side of your home or install an awning. The trees or awning will shade your house. In winter, the leaves will fall off the trees and allow warming sunlight into your home. Instead of planting deciduous trees, you can also install thick curtains that will block the sun, sun screens, or a UV-protective film on the windows to tint them."

It requires a lot more energy to produce a new battery than it does to recharge one that\u2019s already made, so when your current batteries die, replace them with rechargeable ones. Rechargeable batteries are also cheaper in the long run, because you don\u2019t have to keep buying them.

Better yet, try to reuse items around the house, such as washing glass jars and keeping them for food storage. Depending on your municipality, items you may be able to recycle include glass, aluminum cans, bottles, plastic, cardboard, paper, and more.
