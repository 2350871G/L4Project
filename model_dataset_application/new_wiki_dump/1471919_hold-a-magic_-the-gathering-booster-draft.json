  "text":" Preparation Assemble a total of at least four players  Obtain three booster packs for each player. The boosters can be of any set, and in any mixture, but staying within a single block is usually best - for instance Mirage, Visions, Weatherlight or Tempest, Exodus, Stronghold. No more than three sets should be used, as you will need one of each booster for each player for each round. Randomly seat your players at the table. Drafts should be eight players or fewer - so if you have 16 players, you'll need two separate tables of 8. Pass out the first booster to each player. The boosters should be of the same set for each round of the draft. If playing a single block, boosters should be passed out in the order of the block - i.e. Tempest then Stronghold then Weatherlight. Pre-draft Instructions The judge should begin the instructions to the players before the drafting begins  Instruct the players that each round they will have 30 seconds to view the cards in the pack and make a single card selection. You may choose to lower the time limit to 15 seconds if the players are all familiar with the set. Tell the players that once they have made their selection, they need to pass the pack face-down to the player to their left in rounds one and three and to the right in round two.  The judge will announce \"pass\" once the time limit is reached - the players may then view the next pack and the judge should start the timer. Players are not permitted to preview the next deck while awaiting the judge's declaration. The Draft The judge shall set the countdown timer, instruct the players to open the first pack, and start the timer.  Each player should sort through the cards in their pack, select a single card that is placed on the table in front of them, and set the remainder aside for the next player.  Once the judge has called \"pass\" the player should pick up the pack passed to them from the adjacent player, sort and select as in the prior step.  The pick-and-pass process continues for 15 rounds until the first round packs are exhausted.  After each round of the draft, players may review their drafted cards for a predetermined amount of time (30-60 seconds is usually enough) before the next round begins.  The judge should pass out the boosters for round two while the players review their cards.  After the review period has passed, the judge should remind the players to pass right in the second round. Instruct the players to open their second pack. The second round proceeds as the first round, each player picks-and-passes until the packs are empty.  The judge should now instruct the players to review their cards for the predetermined time while passing out the final booster.  Remind the players to pass to the left in round three.  Instruct the players to open the final booster pack. The final round proceeds as the prior two, each player selecting a card and passing the remains until the packs are once again empty. Tournament The tournament can be organized in any manner the judge determines. Bracketed - The players are organized on a bracket chart, and are matched up randomly against an opponent. Bracketed can be played as single or double elimination. Round robin - Players play one round against each other opponent, after the final round, the players with the two best overall records play for the championship\nSwiss Pairing - In the first round players are selected at random to play against each other. The following rounds they are paired via comparable win/loss records. Everyone plays each round (usually 3 or more rounds). The Players are ranked at the end via their win loss records. This keeps everyone involved in the game during the whole tournament. Each round is best two of three games. Generally, there is a one hour time limit each round.",
