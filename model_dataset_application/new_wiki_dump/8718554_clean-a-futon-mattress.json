Do not use too much water, as too much moisture can cause mildew. Most stains will lift with simple detergent and water. Make sure to test your cleaning solution on a small portion of the futon first to make sure your detergent does not cause damage like discoloration."

Metal frames, however, should only be wiped down with a damp cloth. Test any solution you use on a small portion of the frame first to make sure it doesn't damage the futon."

If you notice, say, pet urine or something spilled on the futon, immediately lay paper towels or a sponge over the spot. Press down on them to remove as much of the stain as possible. Take care to use a blotting (pressing and lifting) motion rather than rubbing the stain. If you rub on it, the stain could spread and become more set into the fabric."
