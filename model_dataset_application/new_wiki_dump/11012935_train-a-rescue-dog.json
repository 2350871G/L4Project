Keep this in mind and don\u2019t try to have a lot of physical contact with your dog right from the start. Instead, give it some space and focus on attending to its basic needs, such as giving it food and proper shelter. Your dog is likely to be skittish and stressed out for about a week.

This will make your dog associate both good feelings and good smells with you.Tip: If your dog is so skittish that it won\u2019t eat out of your hand, continue to offer it from your hand at first but then give your dog a bowl of food."

You can encourage your dog to come to you by saying its name or offering it a treat but don\u2019t force affection right off the bat. Going in for a pet or hug can be seen as an aggressive act to a dog that doesn\u2019t trust you yet. One good way to get your dog to interact with you on its own terms is by offering to play fetch with it. A lot of the activity is away from your body but your dog will need to get close to you occasionally to keep the game going."

Do this every day and every time you see your dog sit, so that it learns to associate the word you are saying with the action it is doing. After several weeks of saying the word \u201csit\u201d when your dog naturally sits, start saying the word when you want it to sit. If your dog sits when you ask it to, give it a treat. This will reinforce the action. Some people also have great success by using a training clicker to let their dog know when they should complete a command.
