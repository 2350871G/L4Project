If you need to figure out the number of gallons (liters), you\u2019ll multiply the volume by a multiplier based on the shape of the pool. Use a measuring tape. For a rectangular pool, the formula is length X width X average depth X 7.5. If your pool has a deep end and a shallow end, measure the depth of each, add them, and divide by two to figure out the average depth. For a round pool, the formula is diameter X diameter X average depth X 5.9. If part of the pool is deeper, take the shallow depth plus the deeper depth and divide the number by two. For abnormally shaped pools, adjust these formulas to figure the gallons (liters) in each section, or ask a pool expert for an estimate on how many gallons (liters) your pool holds."
