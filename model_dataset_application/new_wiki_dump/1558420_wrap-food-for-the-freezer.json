  "text":" Choosing Suitable Wrapping for Freezing Select appropriate wrapping. Look for wrapping that has properties of preventing moisture from seeping in or out and that prevents the passing of odors. Examples of suitable wrappings include: Freezer-grade butcher paper, freezer wrap and extra heavy-duty aluminum foil. Check the label of the packaging on possible wrapping materials to ensure that they are appropriate for storing frozen food. If the wrapping is sold in labeled boxes, the following information should be clear:\nThe wrapper is made of moisture-proof material. The wrapper is designed to preserve food (food proof, food safe). The wrapper is strong and is resistant to leaks. Select a wrapper that you can mark on. Writing the date of wrapping, as well as the contents of the items contained in the wrapper is a sensible option to help you to find what you are looking for in the freezer. Adding the date will allow you to quickly determine how long the food has been in the freezer; foods kept too long tend to taste bad, suffer from freezer burn or go off. Wrapping with Butcher's Wrap Use a butcher wrap style for freezing large food items. It is a good option for large or oddly shaped food items because it is large and folds with ease. Measure the wrap. Cut enough wrapping material to roll 2 times around the food. Position the food. Set the food on a corner of the wrapping material. Roll the food in the wrapping material so the wrapping material covers the food twice. Move in the direction of the opposite corner of the wrapping material while rolling the food. Tuck in the sides of the paper. Tuck the sides of the paper into the roll as you move toward the opposite corner. Tucking in the sides of the paper should leave you with a neat cylinder, instead of leaving the edges around the food hanging over the side of the wrap. Press out any air in the roll as you wrap the food.  Continue to roll the food and tuck in the sides of the paper. Roll and tuck until you have reached the opposite corner of the wrapping material. Secure the wrap. Pull the unrolled corner of the wrapping material taut. Use a piece of tape or freezer cord to attach the loose corner to the wrapped roll of food. Label the wrapped food. Write the type of food and the date you wrapped it on the outside of the wrapping material. Wrapping with Aluminum or Kitchen Foil Wrap the food in heavy-duty aluminum foil for foods that contain some moisture or that do not have a uniform shape. Use a bundle wrap when working with kitchen foil. Cut the foil. Cut a piece of aluminum foil into a square shape. Use enough foil to enclose all of the food comfortably in a bundle. Position the food on the foil. Set the food on the center of the square of foil. Begin to fold the foil. Bring the four corners of foil together above the food. The tips of the corners should form the top of a pyramid over the food. Fold the bottom edges of the foil. Fold each of the four open edges on the bottom of the pyramid up around the body of the pyramid. The folded edges should conform to the shape of the body of the pyramid. Press air out of the pyramid as you fold the edges up. There should be no gaps or possibility for food to escape from the body of the pyramid. Tuck in the top of the foil. Fold the top of the pyramid flat against the top of the wrapped food. Secure the wrap. Use a piece of tape or freezer cord to seal the wrap. Place the tape or freezer cord over the top of the wrap. Label the wrapped food. Mark the date and type of food you are freezing on the outside of the wrapping material. Freezing Food in a Container Use freezer-suitable containers when you would like to avoid wrapping or you have sufficient space for stacking containers. Glass or plastic containers designated by the manufacturer as suitable for freezing will consist of a base and a lid (glass containers usually have a plastic lid). Food can be placed straight into the container either already cooled or hot but left to cool completely before freezing. Add the food or liquid to the container. Do not fill to the top; remember that freezing will cause displacement of the liquid when it freezes, taking up more space in the container than the thawed food. If needed, let stand until completely cold. Label as relevant. Some containers have label spaces for either adding a plastic label or writing on. If not, write the date and contents on a piece of paper and affix around the container with a rubber band or string. Place the lid on firmly. Pop into the freezer for freezing. Freezing Food in a Plastic Bag Use a plastic bag in a container as a workaround when containers or space are short in supply. Food frozen in plastic bags or wrapping may not keep its shape. In his case, containers are the best option. However, if you have limited containers or you are not keen on stacking containers in a small freezer space, this hack is great on freezing in shape without requiring long-term use of the container or taking up space. Choose a freezer-suitable container. The container will only be used to freeze the food initially, then it will be removed from the freezer and can be used for other purposes. Both the container and the freezer bag should be of a sufficient size for the contents. Line the container with a plastic freezer bag. Choose high quality freezer bags, to ensure that the covering is strong and moisture-proof. Ladle in cooled food or pour in cooled liquid. Add with care, ensuring that contents fit well into the bag and container. Seal the freezer bag and label the bag. Ensure that the food or liquid is completely cold before placing in the freezer. Place the container with its bagged contents into the freezer. Leave until the contents freeze, forming a block shape.
