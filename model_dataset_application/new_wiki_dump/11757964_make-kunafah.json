  "text":" Preparing the Sugar Syrup Start by boiling 1 cup of water in a pot. Boil water on medium heat for 2-3 minutes until bubbles appear. Stir. When it starts boiling, stir it a little to avoid evaporation of the water. After stirring, add 1 cup of sugar. Let this mix in the water for a minute until the sugar is dissolved. Add a tablespoon of rosewater and a squeeze of lemon juice from the lemon. Stir through. Leave the sugar syrup boiling for another 2 minutes. Then turn off the stove and set it aside to cool. Preparing the Semolina Dough Grab a pie plate to knead the dough in. The point is to stick this dough onto the surface of your dish to make it look like a shape of a pie crust. Prepare the mixture. Combine 2 cups of semolina flour, 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of sugar, \u00be cup of melted butter, and \u00be cup of milk in a large bowl. When it is mixed, it will have thick consistency similar to dough but should be a bit crumbly. Press the dough on the surface of the plate. Spread it evenly to cover the plate completely. Put the dough in the pre-heated oven. Leave it in there for 25-30 minutes until golden brown. This is the part where it bakes like \u201cpound cake\u201d or forms a type of bread. Once baked, leave the oven on but remove the cake. Making the Kunafah Break pieces of the \u201ccake.\u201d Cut or break the cake into parts and place them in a blender. You want this to be very fine or crumbly. Sift the fine blended mixture with a sieve. This helps to create a smooth surface for the kunafah. If you skipped this step, it will appear bumpy, so take your time with it. Cut one medium size slice of butter and spread this across the pie plate. This prevents the mixture from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Along with the butter, add orange food color and spread it all around. The red top the kunafah has comes from this dye on the bottom of the plate. Transfer the cake mixture into the pie plate. You will need to press onto the surface of the plate where the butter and food coloring combine together. This is just like a pie crust, so press it into that form. Make sure the base is smooth by pressing your fingers onto it firmly. Add the mozzarella cheese right on top. It must be cut or shredded before adding, to make the cheese spread easily across the top. Place the dish into the oven for 20-25 minutes on 450\u00b0F.  Check that the cheese has melted and not burned. Turn off the oven. The mozzarella cheese should be melted and it will appear just like a pizza without toppings. Check for a golden-brown crust before removing from the oven. Serving the Kunafah Grab a new plate. Flip the kunafah plate onto the other plate. Grab another plate and put it upside down (the bottom facing up) on the kunafah dish. Now, hold the plate and kunafeh dish and flip it upside down one more time ad the kunafah dish will be on top now. Use oven mitts to hold the hot plate. Add the syrup. Once flipped over, you will see a red-orange top. This is the part where you will pour your sugar syrup that you made earlier. Make sure to pour it so that it reaches every part of the kunafah. Garnish your kunafah with chopped up pistachios. Finally, you are done making this delicious dessert and it is ready to serve.",
