  "text":" Stovetop Sugar Bark Prepare a baking sheet before starting. Line with parchment paper\u2013\u2013this baking sheet is where you will spread the sugar mixture to create the sugar bark once it's melted. Set aside in readiness for use shortly. Put the saucepan on the stovetop, over a medium heat. Place the cup of sugar into the small saucepan. Stir frequently as the sugar heats. Keep stirring until the sugar dissolves; the mixture will come to the boil. Dip a pastry brush into water. Brush the saucepan around the sides, above the line of the sugar. This prevents the mixture from crystallizing. Let the sugar simmer for the next 8 to 10 minutes. Keep an eye on it but don't stir. When a rich, caramel color forms, remove the sugar mixture from the heat. Set down until the bubbles can no longer be seen before proceeding. Pour the sugar mixture onto the prepared baking sheet.

Silicone Sheet Sugar Bark Place a silicone mat onto a baking sheet. The firm base is important for keeping the sheet flat and easily handled. Preheat the oven to 180\u00baC/350\u00baF.
