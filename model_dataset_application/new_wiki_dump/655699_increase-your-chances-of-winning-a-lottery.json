Picking those \u201clucky\u201d numbers limits your ability to win since many lotteries include higher numbers other players tend to ignore. There are only 12 months and 31 days to pick from! You\u2019re better off picking a mixed bag of low and high numbers instead of a few that are close together. For example, a Mega Millions ticket starts with 5 numbers between 1 and 70. You might play 1, 15, 36, 48, and 63. It is a unique ticket that not a lot of people are likely to pick. Think of the odds as well. Many people go for numbers that seem meaningful. Even if you win, you might end up having to share the prize with them."

          "description":"If you\u2019re working hard to come up with a clever number pattern, you\u2019re playing yourself out of a potential winner. Since lotteries pull from a range of numbers, those patterns aren\u2019t likely to show up on the winning ticket. Instead, come up with a range of numbers you like. If they look random on paper, then you\u2019re on the right track. A winning ticket is unlikely to consist of a pattern like 3, 13, 23, 33, 43. It also isn\u2019t likely to be a short range of numbers like 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25. Mix up your ticket with both odd and even numbers. Although the winning numbers could be all odd, for instance, it is unlikely."

The next time you go back to buy a ticket, you may feel tempted to switch to \u201cluckier\u201d numbers, but don\u2019t do it! The odds of you predicting the winning numbers in a game is very low. Instead, stick to the same numbers in case they show up. In theory, your numbers will eventually get picked. Number combinations that were picked in the past are unlikely to come up again. There are too many possible combinations to make this a guarantee, however. You can\u2019t predict the winning numbers, so don\u2019t stress yourself out by trying to. Each drawing is its own random event. Don\u2019t even bother looking at past winners for \u201clucky\u201d numbers."

With a quick pick, the lottery machine selects numbers for you. Many people win this way, although the odds aren\u2019t any different than when you pick your own numbers. Quick picks are random, so you know you will end up with a unique set of numbers no one else is likely to have. It has as much of a chance of winning a single drawing as a ticket you picked yourself. Quick picks save you time, but keep in mind that it\u2019s all chance. Randomly picking numbers that match randomly-picked winning numbers is extra unlikely. These numbers are also harder to remember than ones you play all the time."

Since your chance of winning is so low on the most popular games, you don\u2019t need to go out of your way to spend lots of money playing. You\u2019re better off setting aside a part of your budget for tickets when you have some money to spare. Some people buy hundreds of tickets and lose.

If someone wins, they split the money evenly with everyone else in the pool. Depending on how many people join the pool, you could accumulate a bunch of tickets without shelling out a lot of your own money. Keep in mind that the odds of a big jackpot are still very remote and, if you do win, you will have to share the payout with everyone in the pool. Make sure someone trustworthy handles the money and tickets. Keep a photocopy of your ticket and receipt to ensure you have proof in case you win."

The extra tickets bump up your chances of winning very slightly. The odds of winning are still low no matter how many tickets you get, but this strategy could be fun for you if you\u2019re only in it for the big payout. Many lotteries, including big ones like Powerball, have a cumulative jackpot that gets bigger when no one wins. For the best chance of winning money, do this for a smaller game such as a state pick-3. With bigger games like EuroMillions, your odds will still be very low."

Most lottery commissions have a number of different games to play. You could get cheap cards or play pricier games with bigger prizes.
