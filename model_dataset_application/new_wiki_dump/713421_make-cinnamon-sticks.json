  "text":" Bread Cinnamon Sticks Remove the crusts from the bread. Prepare a baking sheet/tray with baking/parchment paper. Preheat the oven to 350\u00baF/180\u00baC. Cut into sticks 1/2\" / 1.5cm wide.  Melt the butter in a saucepan over low heat. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly. On a small flat plate, mix the cinnamon and sugar together. Be sure to mix right through. Dip the bread sticks into the butter to coat.  Roll or dab each stick in the cinnamon sugar mix.  Place each completed cinnamon stick on the baking tray. Place the tray in the oven and bake for a few minutes, until crisp. Remove from oven and allow to cool before serving. Sprinkle with icing sugar if wished (optional). Enjoy the cinnamon sticks.  Cookie Cinnamon Sticks Preheat the oven to 350\u00baF/180\u00baC. Place parchment paper or a silicone pad across the baking sheet to prevent sticking. Beat the egg whites in a small bowl. Beat until soft peaks form. Add the sugar gradually to the beaten egg whites. Continue beating until the egg white peaks turn stiff. Mix the flour and cinnamon together. Fold into the egg whites. Stir the oil of cinnamon into the melted butter. Mix to combine. Fold into the egg white mixture. Use a teaspoon to transfer the batter to the prepared baking sheet. For each cookie, you'll need two level teaspoonfuls of batter. Use a spatula to spread the batter evenly across the sheet. Leave room between each of the cookies to allow for slight spreading. Place in the preheated oven. Bake for 6 to 7 minutes or until the edges appear golden. While the cookies are baking, oil the handle of a wooden spoon; this will be used to roll the cookies up into sticks. Remove from the oven. Let cool on the cookie sheet for 2 to 3 seconds. Working quickly and with care, wrap the cooling cookies around the oiled spoon handle. Slide each rolled cookie off and onto a wire cooling rack. Keep making the rolled cookies. If they cool too quickly to be rolled as you're working through them, simply place the sheet back into the warm oven (no longer switched on) for up to a minute to just warm. Then remove and repeat until all cookies have been rolled into sticks. Finish up. If wished, tie a small gold or silver cord around each cinnamon stick and tie in a bow. This is optional but very pretty, especially for gift-giving or a seasonal party.",
