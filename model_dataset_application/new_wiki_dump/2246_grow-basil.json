Lemon basil actually contains citral, an aromatic compound found in citrus fruit, and smells very lemony. Purple basil is often grown for decoration, as well as its scent and flowers. There are perennial basils which come back year after year, like African Blue Basil (which has pretty blue veins on its leaves) and Thai Basil, while most other varieties are annuals, which you'll have to plant year after year. Globe and Greek basil are much more difficult to grow, but form pretty little bushes which stay well-contained."

It's best to put basil somewhere where it will get a good deal of sunshine and have well-drained soil. To plant the basil in the garden, dig holes spaced at least 1 foot (0.3 m) apart. Place the roots in the holes and place soil around the stems. Pat down soil around the plants to eliminate air pockets. If you want to plant the basil in a container, make sure it's large enough to accommodate the number of plants you're growing; they need to be planted 1 foot (0.3 m) apart, since they grow quite large."
