Once you\u2019ve boiled the water, set it aside so that it can cool off to room temperature. While the water is cooling, work on harvesting the yeast from the fermenter. This will help you save some time. The exact temperature of the water doesn't matter as long as it's roughly the same as the temperature of the room that you're working in. Use this method if you want to remove solids and yeast from the previous beer batch."
