Boil toor dal with water and cooking oil in a pressure cooker. Allow to cook for 5 to 6 whistles. The dal should be in a mashed state once cooked. If you find any partially mashed dal, mash it manually with a round spoon. Squeeze tamarind juice out of the soaked tamarind. Add it to the mashed dal. Be careful not to burn your hands because the dal is still hot! Saut\u00e9ing Heat pan and pour in some oil. Set flame to medium. Once oil is heated, add mustard. Let all the mustard crack. Pinch off the stem and saut\u00e9 the red chili in hot oil. (In Tamil, molaga means 'red chili' and killi means 'pinch'. Hence the name molagakilli sambar! ) Added thinly sliced onion and saut\u00e9 well until it develops a very mild golden color.  Add roughly chopped tomato and let it cook completely.
