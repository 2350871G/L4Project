As you level up, you will also begin to encounter rarer, more powerful Pok\u00e9mon in the world and have access to better items at Pok\u00e9Stops. You gain different levels of experience for completing different tasks, and the amount of experience you gain increases once you become a more powerful trainer. Here are some things you can do to level up your trainer and the XP rewards you get from them at the beginning of the game:\n100 XP \u2013 Pok\u00e9mon Caught\n500 XP \u2013 New Pok\u00e9mon\n10 XP \u2013 Curve Ball\n10 XP \u2013 Nice Throw\n50 XP \u2013 Great Throw\n100 XP \u2013 Excellent Throw\n50 XP \u2013 Checking in at a Pok\u00e9Stop\n100 XP \u2013 Battling a Pok\u00e9mon Trainer at a Gym\n150 XP \u2013 Beating a Pok\u00e9mon Trainer at a Gym\n50 XP \u2013 Beat a Pok\u00e9mon in training at a Gym\n200 XP \u2013 Hatch a Pok\u00e9mon\n500 XP \u2013 Evolve a Pok\u00e9mon Use special attacks during gym battles. When you're battling another trainer, you can charge up a special attack by holding a long tap on the screen and letting it go when the bar is full. These attacks are more powerful than your Pok\u00e9mon's regular combat moves. This takes a long time to charge up, so it may not be possible during all gym battles. Battle Pok\u00e9mon according to their types. All Pok\u00e9mon have types that are strong against certain other types and weak against others. When battling, try to match your Pok\u00e9mon up against a Pok\u00e9mon that will give yours an advantage. This chart shows you which Pok\u00e9mon are stronger and weaker against others (the arrow points to the strongest types). Save your battery life. Pok\u00e9mon Go will devour your battery if you don't take measures to save it. To do this, tap the Pok\u00e9ball icon at the bottom of your screen and then the \"Settings\" icon at the top-right. Tap on the \"Battery Saver\" option for a greatly-improved battery life.",
