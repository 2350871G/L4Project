Some good options include:\nBridesmaid Trade (No listing fee, but $15 charge added to sales price). Wedding Bee Classified (no fee or commission). Smart Bride Boutique (no fee or commission).

Try posting a picture of the dress and some info about it, such as the size, color, brand, and how much you would like to get for it. Share the post on your Facebook feed and invite friends to share to help you sell the dress. For example, you could post a picture with a caption that says something like, \u201cSelling this bridesmaid dress that I only wore one time! It is a size 14, forest green, floor length, strapless dress. The brand is Calvin Klein. I\u2019d like to get $50 dollars for it. It cost me $125 new.

          "description":"Finding similar used dresses is the best way to ensure that you get a good price for your dress. Check the website where you are considering listing your dress to see if anyone else is selling your dress. If not, check the website for any dresses in a similar style or by the same designer. Note the price on any dresses you find and use this price to help you price your dress. For example, if you find the exact same dress for sale on a website for $80, then you may also want to price your dress at $80. If you find dresses by the same designer as your dress tend to go between $150 and $200, then you could list your dress at $175. However, if you want to sell your dress faster, then price it lower than the other dresses you find."

          "description":"When purchasing items online, people like to see pictures of what they will be getting. Take some clear photos of your dress from multiple angles. Some helpful ways to get the best image include:\nHaving someone model the dress. If the dress fits you well, then you can model the dress in the photos, or you can ask a friend to be your model if the dress no longer fits you. You can also use a mannequin if you have one. Using natural light. Take photos outside during the daytime and do not use a flash. Position your model or mannequin in a partially shaded area. If it is too dark, then you can use aluminum reflectors to ensure that the clothing is well lit. Not altering the photos. For example, avoid using filters that will affect the way the color looks, adjusting the contrast, or doing anything else to the photos that might be misleading."

Choose a day (or a couple of days) to have your sale and set up a little shop in your front yard or garage. You could even band together with your neighbors and plan to have yard sales on the same days to increase the number of people who stop by. Post large, easy to read signs directing people to the sale as well. Mention the dress in ads or signs that you use to promote your yard sale. Display your bridesmaid dress where people will see it. Hang it on the front of a rack or put it on a dress form if you have one. Be prepared to haggle. You may want to put a slightly higher price on the dress than you want. For example, if you would like to get $75 for the dress, then put $95 on it. Then, if someone asks if you\u2019d be willing to take less, you can let them know you\u2019d be willing to go as low as $75."
