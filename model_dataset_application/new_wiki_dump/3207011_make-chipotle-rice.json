          "description":"Add the oil to a room temperature skillet and place on the stove. Heat the oil over medium-high heat for a minute or two. The oil should be glossy and smooth, but it should not smoke at any point during the cooking process. If the oil begins to smoke, it means that the fat has begun to break down, which, in turn, means that the flavor will be thrown off."

        {
          "headline":"Cook the onion and garlic.",
          "description":"Add the chopped onion to the oil and cook, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1 minute. Both the onion and garlic should be tender and fragrant when ready. Do not add the garlic simultaneously with the onion. Wait until after the onion has already gotten somewhat tender before adding the garlic; otherwise, the garlic may burn."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Add the chili powder.",
          "description":"Sprinkle the chili powder over the onion and garlic, stirring it in and cooking the contents of the pan for another 1 minute. The onion and garlic should be evenly coated by the chili powder. After cooking the contents with the chili powder, the fragrance of the chili powder should be drawn out, as well."

          "description":"Add the rice, water, undrained tomatoes, chipotle peppers, peas, salt, and black pepper, as well as 1 Tbsp (15 ml) or more of the reserved adobo sauce. The adobo sauce provides the \"kick\" associated with chipotle flavor. If you prefer a milder rice, stick with 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of sauce. If you like it hot, though, go ahead and add a little more. Bring the contents of the skillet to a boil, stirring occasionally."

If juices flow into the empty space it leaves behind, cook the rice for a little longer. If the empty space stays clean and clear of juices, the rice is ready."

Place the coriander seeds into a mortar and break the seeds into a fine, ground powder by smashing them against the side of the little dish using the pestle. If you do not have a mortar and pestle, you could improvise by placing the seeds into a small but durable ceramic bowl and grinding them using the handle end of an ice cream scoop or meat tenderizer.

Stir the seasonings together for a minute or two using a spoon. You will not be able to verify whether or not all the seasonings are truly and evenly dispersed, but in general, if the speckling seems consistent throughout the mixture, the seasonings are probably sufficiently blended."
