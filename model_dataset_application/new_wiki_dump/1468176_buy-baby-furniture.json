          "description":"Use a tape measure or a laser measurer and measure the size of your nursery. Pay specific attention to wall space, as most of your furniture will go along the wall. Think about where you will place:\nYour crib. A standard crib is about 4 to 5 feet (1 to 2 m) (1.2 to 1.5 m) long. A changing table. Changing tables can be between 3 and 5 feet (0.9 and 1.5 m) long. A rocking chair. You\u2019ll probably need 3 to 4 feet (.9 to 1.2 m) of wall space for a rocking chair."

This is important, as you\u2019ll want all the furniture to fit together into your plan for the room. Look on websites like Pinterest and Parenting.com for ideas about how to decorate your baby's room. Some themes include animals, outdoors, and fairytales. If you decide on a certain color, like white, pink, or baby blue, you\u2019ll likely want to purchase all your furniture in that color. You may want to consider purchasing a set so everything matches."

By waiting, you\u2019ll be able to confirm the sex of the baby and make sure that your pregnancy is normal and healthy."

Since the crib is the centerpiece of the entire nursery, you\u2019ll want to match everything to it. Ultimately, your crib style will help you decide on many other items you\u2019ll need for the nursery. Some types of cribs include: standard cribs, portable cribs, and multipurpose cribs (that include a changing table). You could also choose a crib that converts to a toddler bed or full-size bed so your child can use it for years to come. The major styles of cribs are traditional (these usually have intricate woodwork) and modern (these are often very angular)."

This is important, as old furniture may put your baby at risk of injury or even death. Check each piece of furniture for recalls to ensure your baby\u2019s safety. In the U.S., you can see a list of recalled items at https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls. Slats on cribs shouldn\u2019t be spaced more than 2 and 3/8 inches (60 mm) apart. Use a changing table that has cabinets or drawers so potentially hazardous products will be out of reach of your baby. Focus on furniture with round edges or purchase caps that cover sharp edges. While you can consider certain older pieces of furniture, like rocking chairs, make sure you verify that they are sturdy."

To meet current safety standards, your crib should have nothing in it but a mattress and a tight sheet. Don't use crib bumpers. The American Academy of Pediatrics warns that crib bumpers may cause sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Do not allow your baby to sleep with a blanket or a pillow. Avoid leaving toys in a baby's crib while they sleep."

This is important, as sharp edges and other features on furniture could pose safety hazards to your child. Be sure to use the anchors included with the furniture to anchor each piece to the wall so it doesn\u2019t fall over and cause injuries or damage."
