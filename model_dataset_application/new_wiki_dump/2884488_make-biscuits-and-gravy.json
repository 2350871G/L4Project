For best results, spoon the flour into your measuring cup and level it off with the back of a kitchen knife. Avoid scooping the flour directly into the cup, since doing so will pack the flour down and cause you to gather too much flour."

Cut the shortening and butter with the knife, tossing the pieces about in the flour mixture as you work. Work quickly so that the butter does not melt."

Only stir long enough to moisten the dough. It should be neither sticky nor dry; instead, it should be fairly tacky. If the dough seems too dry, add 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of additional buttermilk to moisten it."

Lightly flour your hands before handling the dough to prevent it from sticking to your skin. If you decide to use a rolling pin, lightly flour the rolling pin before bringing it into contact with the dough."

Arrange these rounds on your prepared baking sheet, placing them 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) apart. You could use the rim of a glass in the absence of a biscuit cutter or cookie cutter. Dip the biscuit cutter in flour in between cuttings to prevent the dough from sticking. Press straight down with the biscuit cutter. Do not twist the cutter as you form the biscuits. Leaving space in between the biscuits will give them crunchy sides. For soft sides, place them together so that they just barely touch."
