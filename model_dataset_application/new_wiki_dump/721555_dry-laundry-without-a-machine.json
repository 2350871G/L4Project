Only wring out one garment at a time so that you can get the most excess water out of each garment. Once your towel has become very damp, switch towels. Your towel must be relatively dry to absorb the most amount of water. If you're drying small items, such as socks, spread them out on your towel so that you can wring them at the same time. As long as these small items aren't touching, it will be like wringing out one large piece of clothing."

Hang your line high enough off the ground so that if you hang something heavy, like a blanket or something denim or made from other heavy fabrics, it will not touch the ground and get dirty.
