This should result in a much thinner triangle. Repeat the same fold to your thin triangle. Once you have your third fold, cut the wide end off with scissors. This will cut all the degrees of the circumference at once. Once you have accomplished this, unfold the plastic to reveal your circle. Alternatively, you can cut the corners off the square to make an octagon shape. Any additional amount of angles is good; what's important is that it starts to resemble a circle."

If the nail you're using is large, don't push it through all the way. The parachute holes should be just big enough for the strings to fit through."

Stringing Up the Parachute Make six equal pieces of string. String will allow you to tie a weight to the plastic bag, transforming it into a parachute. Cut out six equal pieces of string.

Making a Quick Square Parachute Cut a 60 centimeter (23.6 in) string and cut into 15 centimeter (5.9 in) strips (4).  Cut the plastic bag into a square. Each side should measure 20 centimeter (7.9 in). Cut 4 holes on each tip of string. Tie a piece of string on each corner of the square plastic bag.  Tie the string's bottom ends as one and knot. Open the peg/clothes pin and put it on the end. It's now ready for flight.",
