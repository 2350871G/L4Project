  "text":" Starting to Fold Take a square piece of paper. Fold it in half. Try to make the fold as neat as possible so that it\u2019ll allow you to get the most precise outcome. Use a ruler to draw a line from the top left of the paper where the fold is down to the bottom right of the rectangle where the folded paper opens. This is where you\u2019ll use your scissors to cut the paper in half. One half of the paper will be used in later steps. Cut along the lines. Put the spare triangles to one side. Cut as precisely as possible. Use the ruler as a guide if it helps. Open the folded triangle to reveal a \u201cbigger triangle.\u201d This bigger triangle is going to be turned into the leaf. Starting from the bottom, fold a 0.5 cm concertina until you get to the very top. Try to make the folds even as you go up making the concertina. Fold the concertina in half. The long flat edges should meet, with the tip being on the outside. This completes the basic design of the leaf. Press down on the concertina so that it bends easily. This will make it easier to glue it. Adding the Stem Roll the stem. To do this, take one of the discarded triangles, rolling it into a tube. This can be as long as you want it to be. Make sure the tube is as skinny as possible. Then press down on it, flattening it. It should look be flat enough where it can be glued to the leaf. Bend the top of the stem into a curve. Wrap it on the tip of the leaf and glue it. Make sure it is proportional to the leaf so it does not look misaligned when glued. Apply glue to either side of the concertina and glue it together. Make sure enough glue is added to hold it together. Press down on the concertina where the glue is applied for it to stick properly. Wait for a few minutes to let the glue dry. Extend the concertina from both sides to show the leaf design.",
