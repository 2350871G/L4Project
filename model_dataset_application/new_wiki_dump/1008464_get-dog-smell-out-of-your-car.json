Immediately place a few layers of absorbent paper towel over the urine. Allow the paper towel to soak up some of the stain. Cover the towels with a few large layers of newspaper. After soaking up most of the urine, rinse the area with cold water. Then, use towels or a wet/dry vacuum to soak up the water."

Mix 7 tablespoons (100 ml) of brown sugar, one and a half cups of orange peels, and a liter of water together in a large bottle. Give the bottle a good shake, open the lid slightly, and let it sit for about 3 months. You can simply place the bottle in your car. It should absorb dog odors and leave your car smelling like oranges."
