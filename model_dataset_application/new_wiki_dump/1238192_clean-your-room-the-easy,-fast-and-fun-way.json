  "text":" Piling the mess Put all the things that make your room a mess onto the floor. Be sure to pull out all of the junk from underneath your bed and in your closet. Divide the mess into separate piles of trash, clothes, and toys or other belongings. You can also have an \"undecided\" pile for possible donations or trash (but not sure). Clean up the trash pile first. Throw out all garbage, things that you will never use again, and rotten food. You may need to make another pile for things that you will give away or donate. Tidying the rest of the room Make your bed to give yourself a nice laundry folding space.  Separate your clean clothes from your dirty clothes. Put the clean clothes onto the bed and the dirty clothes into a hamper or laundry basket. To save on laundry time, put away things that you only tried on briefly. Smell it if you aren't sure. Now, you only have toys and other belongings on the floor. Briskly straighten that stuff up by putting things in their appropriate places on shelves, in drawers, or boxes in the closet. Finally, fold up all the clean clothes on your bed and (neatly) put them away in your dresser. Hang all closet items neatly in the closet. Move furniture as necessary to facilitate vacuuming, sweeping or mopping.  Next, tidy up all your dresser, shelf, and countertops by arranging objects, wiping away dust, and putting stray objects away. ",
