The Picture card box contains 365 large cards so is impractical to be passing around each turn, so open the box and find a central position on the table for it to sit for the entire game. The game comes with 20 different tokens featuring a wide variety of historical figures. Each player needs to select their preferred historical figure and place it on a token base. All tokens start the game in the Stone Age square."
