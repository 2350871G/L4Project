      "description":"Studies have shown that organic milk is much healthier than regular milk. Organic milk comes from cows that haven't been given growth hormones, it is wholesome, produced without harmful pesticides, etc. Organic milk isn't produced with antibiotics. Overuse of antibiotics is a serious health problem. Organic milk comes from cows that were not given antibiotics, so it doesn't contribute to the growing problem of bacterial resistance. Organic milk is very high in conjugated linoleic acids (CLA). CLAs are important healthy fats that have been proven to have been linked to reduced heart disease and diabetes. As a matter of fact, in the Archives of Internal Medicine, researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital and the Harvard School of Public Health reported that dairy products that are low in fat, including milk, is shown to lower the risk of type 2 diabetes (in men). Another big advantage of organic milk over regular milk is its ability to go for a long time without turning sour: organic milk is heated to around 280 \u00b0F (138 \u00b0C), so it would take up to two months for it to turn sour. Because of the fact that regular, pasteurized milk is heated to 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C), it doesn't have the same life. So if you are worried about milk turning sour fairly quickly, then organic milk may actually allow you to save money. Understand that it's the right thing to do. Organic cows must be able to access open air, unlike factory cows. Cows that produce organic milk or organic cows from many dairy farms are allowed to graze freely in the organic pasture. This type of farming is considerate to animals, and isn't cruel, is very supportive of wildlife, is good for many rural communities, is respectful of air, water, and soil, and is healthy for people."
