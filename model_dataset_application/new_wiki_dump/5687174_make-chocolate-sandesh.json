  "text":" Making the dough Crumble the chenna as you add it to a blender, grinder or a food processor. You can also mix this by hand. Add the sugar and chocolate/cocoa powder.  Blend together to combine fully. If mixing by hand, use a wooden spoon to mix thoroughly. Transfer the blended mixture to a frying pan. Cook over a low flame, stirring continuously. Continue cooking until the mixture gains a smooth and velvety texture. There should still be some moisture left to avoid the mixture turning rubbery but the dough should be well formed by this stage. This will take around 5 minutes or so. Remove from the heat. Transfer the dough to a wide, shallow dish (such as a thali or a low bowl) and allow it to cool enough to be handled safely. Knead the dough. When it is cool enough to handle, knead the dough gently. Knead until a smooth ball forms. Making the sweets Take about a teaspoon of mixture and form into a ball. Place the ball on a baking sheet covered in parchment paper, then slightly flatten with your thumb, pushing an indentation into the middle of the sweet. This indentation will hold any garnish you may wish to add. Repeat for the remaining dough until you have used up the whole mixture.  If using a garnish, add now. The garnish can be any of the following or a combination of them: chopped pistachios, chopped almonds, chopped cashews, chopped raisins or sultanas, grated chocolate, etc. Serve immediately. The chocolate sandesh is best served once made, while it remains room temperature soft. If you are not able to serve it straight away, refrigerate it until serving time.
