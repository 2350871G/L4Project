Try combining a picture with a witty caption, or just go graphic with a symbol like a star or an emoji. Don't upload any logo that may be trademarked, including sports teams or brand logos. However, if the website has them available as a template, they're fine to use. Depending on the style of hoodie you choose, you may be limited where you can place your designs.

Just turn your sweatshirt inside-out and draw a line where you want your new neckline to be, then cut along the line. Cut across the collar at 2 sharp angles to create a V-neck. Cut a wide line across the collar to create a boat-neck. Cut slightly into the top of one sleeve to create an off-the-shoulder look."

Wash it thoroughly and enjoy the new look! Make sure to protect your work area with towels and wear gloves so you don\u2019t dye your hands! If your sweatshirt is a dark color, you can use dye remover or bleach to lighten it. To tie-dye your sweatshirt, twist the garment into knots and secure it with rubber bands. Then, dip the sweatshirt into the dye just as you normally would."
