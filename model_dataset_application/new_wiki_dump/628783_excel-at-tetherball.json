      "description":"If it goes high, make the return strike higher. If it goes in the middle return in in the middle, but hit harder than your opponent. This will surprise your opponent and gain you a point! Be sure to focus on the ball, not your opponent. While it's good strategy to watch your opponent for a second to see if you can guess his plan, try not to take your eye off the ball for too long."

      "headline":"Let it wrap.",
      "description":"Sometimes you can trick an inexperienced player by letting him wrap once or twice and then standing by the side of the pole high and over his head (or slow and in front of him to unwrap and counter-strike). Be sure to return the strike with lots of power!"
