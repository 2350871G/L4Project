If you are going to mix your concrete on-site, purchase bags of concrete from your local home improvement store. You buy bags ranging from 60-80 lbs. Pour your concrete into a wheelbarrow, bucket, or plastic tub. Pour a small quantity of water into the concrete powder. Use a hoe to start blending the water and powder. When all of the water has been absorbed, add a little more water. Continue to add small amounts of water until your concrete is thick and smooth. If your concrete is clumpy, it needs more water. If you concrete is runny, then it has too much water and will not be strong enough. You will need to add more dry concrete to the mixture. Use a bucket to add the water, not your garden hose. It's too hard to control the amount of water that comes out of a garden hose. You can also use a small mixer to stir the concrete. If you don't have one, they are available for rent at many home improvement and hardware stores. Use water to wash off any concrete that gets on your skin. Wash your tools immediately after finishing to avoid having the concrete dry on them. If your job will require more than 30 bags of concrete, it's best to order a delivery of pre-mixed concrete from a truck."
