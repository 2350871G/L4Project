          "description":"Before you start any sort of cleaning, be sure to disconnect your Philips Airfryer from its power source. Then, wait for about 30 minutes to allow the components to cool down before you start washing them out. If you can\u2019t wait for the Airfryer to cool down completely, make sure you wear heat-resistant gloves before handling the hot appliance. If you wear oven gloves, avoid getting water on them as they\u2019ll fail to protect your hands once they get wet."

          "description":"Once everything has had some time to cool off, grab the handle on the pan and slide it out horizontally from the body of the appliance. Next, lift out the frying basket and set this aside for a moment. You\u2019ll probably want to set the basket in your sink or on a few pieces of paper towel to catch any drips of grease."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Discard the grease from the bottom of the pan.",
          "description":"If you notice that the bottom of the pan is lined in grease, get rid of this before washing the pan with soapy water. Hold the pan over a lidded disposable container, such as a glass jar or plastic tub, and carefully tip out the grease into it. Once you\u2019ve gotten all of the grease out, seal up the container and discard it. While liquid fats will easily drip out, you might need to scoop out solid fats. Use a plastic utensil to do this. Don\u2019t use a metal tool as it might scratch the nonstick coating on the pan. Refrain from tipping the grease down your sink; this will only clog up your pipes."

          "headline":"Soak the pan and basket in hot, soapy water to remove sticky residue.",
          "description":"Reinsert the basket, then fill up the pan with hot water and mild dish soap. With the basket nested inside the sudsy pan, leave both pieces to soak for about 10 minutes. If your air fryer isn\u2019t too dirty and you don\u2019t notice any gunky grease spots, feel free to skip this step."

          "headline":"Scrub out the pan and basket with a sponge or soft-bristled brush.",
          "description":"After soaking the pan and basket, lift out the basket and scrub off the food and grease residue. Use hot, soapy water and a sponge or soft-bristled brush to scrub around both sides of the mesh. Rinse this piece off and set it aside. Next, gently scrub the pan in a similar way. Finally, rinse off any remaining suds from the inside and outside of the pan and basket. Refrain from using stiff-bristled brushes or steel wire sponges to clean your air fryer. These may quickly scratch up the nonstick coating. Especially tough grease stains can be removed using a more powerful liquid degreaser, but you\u2019ll want to check the manual for your Philips Airfryer to confirm what types of products will work best without damaging the nonstick coating."

          "description":"While hand-washing is the recommended cleaning method, the pan and basket in a Philips Airfryer are dishwasher safe. First, tip out the grease. Then, give each piece a quick rinse and scrub to get rid of as much food residue and grease as possible. Finally, set the pan and basket face-down into your dishwasher and run a normal cycle with mild dish detergent. If these pieces aren\u2019t particularly dirty, the dishwasher can be a faster and lower-maintenance alternative to hand-washing. However, you\u2019ll want to soak, scrub, and hand-wash them if you notice a lot of grease or build-up. Keep in mind that the appliance itself isn\u2019t dishwasher safe; you\u2019ll need to remove the pan and basket to wash them."

Once they\u2019re dry, go ahead and place the basket back into the pan, then slide the pan into the body of the appliance."

Before you start cleaning your Philips Airfryer, unplug it from its power source and allow it to cool down completely. Wait about 30 minutes for your appliance to reach room temperature. Refrain from cleaning the inside or heating element while the appliance is still hot. Wipe down the outside using a moist, damp cloth. To eliminate fingerprints and food bits from the outside of your Philips Airfryer, get a lint-free cloth moist with hot water. Use this to wipe down all of the outside surfaces, including the handle and buttons. If necessary, spray a small amount of degreasing solution onto your cloth and use this to rub away any stubborn spots. Take out the pan and basket, then turn the Aifryer appliance upside-down. In order to easily reach the heating element, which sits above the pan and basket, you\u2019ll have to flip the whole appliance upside-down. First, slide out the pan and basket and set these pieces aside. Then, use 2 hands to rotate your appliance. Set the flat top part of the appliance down onto a flat work surface. The heating element looks like the coils on an electric stovetop. Avoid trying to clean the element while the appliance is right-side up. You\u2019ll have a hard time seeing the coils and probably won\u2019t be able to thoroughly clean them. Scrub out the inner chamber and heating element using a soapy sponge. Dampen a sponge or soft-bristled brush with hot water and mild dish soap. With the appliance turned upside-down, you\u2019ll be able to see the heating element very clearly. Start by scrubbing the surface of the coil to release the greasy residue. Rinse off your sponge or brush as needed, and continue to wipe down the rest of the inner chamber. Allow the inner chamber to air-dry for 30 to 60 minutes before sliding the pan back into the appliance. You\u2019ll probably need to discard the sponge as it will collect a lot of grease. Refrain from cleaning out the inside of your Philips Airfryer with a steel wire sponge or a stiff bristle brush. Use a flexible cleaning brush to reach behind the heating element, or try an old toothbrush for a more detailed clean. Deep-Cleaning the Heating Element Spray a baking soda solution onto the heating element. Mix up a solution using 3 g (0.11 oz) of baking powder and 100 millilitres (0.42  c) of water. Use a spray bottle to spritz this solution onto the heating element while the appliance is turned upside-down. Let the solution settle for 1 or 2 minutes, then flip the appliance right-side up and leave it to soak for 30 more minutes. Repeat this process once more to get rid of especially stubborn residue. Make sure the appliance is unplugged and completely cool. You\u2019ll also need to take out the pan and basket before applying the solution. Pour about 400 millilitres (1.7  c) of water into the pan and reinsert it. Start with a clean pan so you don\u2019t allow any more grease or food residue to circulate around the air fryer. Line the bottom of the pan with about 400 millilitres (1.7  c) of water. With the appliance right-side-up, slide the pan and basket back into the appliance. Run the Airfryer for 20 minutes to dislodge any remaining residue. Plug your Philips Airfryer back into a power source, then the temperature to 200 \u00b0C (392 \u00b0F).
