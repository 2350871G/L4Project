          "headline":"Face the dartboard sideways with your dominant foot forward.",
          "description":"Your feet should be facing towards the side of the room, rather than towards the throw line. If you are right-handed, your right foot will be forward, with your big toe just behind the throw line. Your left foot will be on the floor just behind your right foot. If you're left-handed, your left foot will be forward and your right foot will be behind your left foot. Your dominant hand should be forward, loose next to your dominant foot. So if you are right-handed, your right hand will be forward. If you are left-handed, your left hand will be forward. It's okay if your back heel raises a bit off the floor in this stance. Do not lift your back foot up though. Make sure you are still putting weight on it. Avoid standing with your body facing the dartboard head on, as this is not a very stable stance. Facing to the side of the dartboard will help you develop a more accurate throw."

This will help to keep your dart throws straight and accurate. Keep your other foot turned to the side. Your body should remain turned slightly to the side, even though your front foot is angled forward. You can mark the spot on the floor with your shoe so you know where to line up your front foot every time you throw."

          "headline":"Maintain straight shoulders and hips.",
          "description":"Do not slouch over or roll your hips back. Keep your shoulders and hips stacked on top of each other. You want to keep your shoulders, hips, and legs straight at all times when you are throwing darts. Some dart players will lean their upper body slightly forward over the throw line to feel more comfortable in their stance and get closer to the board. You can do this as long as your legs or feet do not cross the throw line. However, leaning too far forward can compromise your stance and your throw."

You can then also hold it at the end of the barrel with your ring finger if you want a more stable grip. Do not hold the dart at the tip of the dart or at the flight, which is at the very back of the dart. Do not curl your fingers as you grip the dart. Instead, keep them long and open. Keep in mind a dart with a shorter barrel will usually require fewer fingers for gripping. A dart with a longer barrel may require more fingers to maintain a good grip."
