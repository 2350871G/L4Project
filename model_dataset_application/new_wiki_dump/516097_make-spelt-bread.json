          "description":"In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, yeast, and sugar. Then add the water and stir the ingredients to barely combine everything. It\u2019s important to be precise about the amount of water when you're working with spelt flour. Adding too much water will make the dough sticky and weak, while too little will make the dough dry and dense. You can replace the sugar with an equal amount of honey if you prefer."

          "headline":"Add the oil.",
          "description":"When the flour and water just come together but don\u2019t quite make a proper dough, add the oil. Stir in the oil with a dough whisk or wooden spoon. When the ingredients are mostly combined, knead the dough in the bowl until it comes together to make a smooth but wet dough. The entire mixing process, starting when you add the water, should take about four minutes. Any less and the protein won\u2019t develop properly, but any more and the proteins will start to break down. The consistency of spelt dough isn't the same as with regular flour. Don\u2019t be surprised if the dough has a stickier and pastier consistency than what you're used to."

Let it rise for about an hour, or until it doubles in size. A good place for rising bread is in an oven that\u2019s turned off, but with the oven light on."

Shape the dough into a loaf or a flattened ball and transfer it to a greased baking sheet or loaf pan. For a heartier bread, you can knead in nuts and seeds at this point. You can add up to 1 cup (about 140 g) of nuts or seeds, such as walnuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, and pine nuts."

When the dough is ready, bake it for 35 to 40 minutes, until the crust is a light golden brown. Before baking, you can brush the top of the dough with oil and sprinkle it with more nuts."

After two hours, you can use the dough immediately or transfer it to the fridge for up to five days before using it. The dough will be easier to work with if you chill it first.

This recipe makes about a 1.5-pound (454 g) loaf, so use a loaf pan that\u2019s around 8.5 by 4.5 inches (21.6 by 11.4 cm).
