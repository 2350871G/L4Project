  "text":" Preparation Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly and clean the undersides of your nails. Prepare a clean, flat dumpling preparation surface. Combine all ingredients for dumpling skins in a large bowl.  Making the Dough Dust hands with all-purpose flour.  Mix the dough in a bowl with your hands until all ingredients are evenly distributed.  Sprinkle kitchen surface with all-purpose flour.  Place dough mixture on the flour sprinkled surface.  Mix dough by kneading. Knead until dough is round in shape. Place a damp paper towel on the round dough ball to lock in moisture.  Let the dough rest while the filling is prepared.  Making the Pork Filling Place all chives into large mixing bowl.  Add vegetable oil and mix well with the chives.  Beat eggs in small bowl.  Add egg mixture into the large mixing bowl. Mix well. Add ground pork, salt, sugar, soy sauce, white pepper powder, and onion powder to mixture. Mix well. Dust hands with all-purpose flour.  Shape dough ball into long rope with an approximately 1\u201d diameter using hands.  Use a knife to cut off half inch cross sections of the dough rope. Rotate the rope 90 degrees with each cut. Flatten each dough piece with flour dusted palms.  Flatten each dough piece into a thin flat, round circle with a rolling pin. The skin should be as close to paper thin as possible without becoming transparent or breaking. Place approximately one tablespoon of the pork filling into a dumpling skin.  Fold the ends of the skins of the skin together and begin pinching the skin closed in small sections starting from one end of the dumpling. The pinching motion should create dumpling skin folds. Make sure to pinch the skin until it is tightly closed, or else the dumpling will fall apart when cooked. Traditionally, dumplings are crescent shaped. However, if you are a beginner, do not worry about the shape. Just make sure the dumpling filling is securely enclosed by tightly pinching the skin together. Repeat this process until all materials are used up.  Cooking the Dumplings Boil the water in a large pan until there are large bubbles on the surface.  Gently place as many dumplings as you can to cover the surface area of the bottom of the pan since uncooked dumplings will sink to the bottom of the pan. Do not overcrowd the pan during the boiling process, because the dumplings will begin to stick to each other. The dumplings will take approximately 5 minutes to cook. During this time, gently move them around with a spatula to keep them from sticking to each other and the pan. The dumplings should be floating on the surface of the boiling water when they are done.
