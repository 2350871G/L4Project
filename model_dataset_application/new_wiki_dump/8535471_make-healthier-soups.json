          "description":"Ultimately, the quality of a soup is determined by the quality of ingredients you use to make it. Thus, you should use fresh ingredients whenever you can. By using fresh ingredients, you\u2019ll make sure that your soup tastes good and is free of additives that could harm your health. If you can\u2019t find fresh vegetables or other ingredients, use frozen ingredients. While canned products may be okay, they often contain added sodium and preservatives. In addition, some canned food may be contaminated with the carcinogen, BPA. Beans and lentils are a great way to make a more filling soup. Used dried beans instead of canned. Soak them overnight before adding them to your soup."

          "headline":"Make your own broth.",
          "description":"By making ingredients from scratch, you\u2019ll make sure that you know what will be in your soup and that it is healthy. Avoid store-bought broth. Store-bought broth is often high in sodium, has preservatives, and other additives that could be harmful to your health. To make your own vegetable broth, simply cook a mixture of vegetables for 5 minutes, add water and simmer them for 45 minutes. Strain your broth at the end. To make a basic beef broth, cover four pounds of beef marrow and knuckle bones with twelve cups of water. Add onions, celery, and herbs if desired. Bring to a boil before reducing the heat. Simmer for up to twenty four hours. Strain at the end. To make chicken broth, put four pounds of chicken in a large pot with about four quarts of water. Simmer it for up to two hours before straining."

          "description":"While it may be tempting to buy the most common and cheapest products to use in your soup, you should instead buy the healthiest products possible. Focus on natural, healthy, or green product lines for anything you use in your soup. You may have to visit specialty health stores, or grocery stores like Whole Foods, Earth Fare, or Fresh Market for a larger diversity of healthy products. Review the ingredient list of any product your purchase. For example, if you\u2019re buying vegetable broth to put in your soup, look at the ingredients to see what sort of preservatives and additives are present. The more names you don\u2019t recognize or can\u2019t understand, the more you should stay away from the item. Look at the nutritional information of a product. Buy products that are low in saturated fat, trans fat, and sodium."

          "headline":"Avoid putting too much salt.",
          "description":"Using too much salt is a common mistake that many people make when making soups. Although you might think that you\u2019re improving the soup, you\u2019re substantially increasing the sodium content and negatively impacting your health. Read the label of any pre-made ingredients, like broth, before you add them to a soup. Calculate the sodium content of any item you use in your soup into the overall amount of sodium in the soup. Over consumption of sodium could create high blood pressure. If you have heart disease, it could worsen your condition. The American Heart Association suggests that adults consume no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium every day. In addition, some doctors recommend that adults limit their consumption to 1,500 milligrams a day. To give you an idea, 1 teaspoon of salt has 2,300 milligrams of sodium. Sodium is present in almost all foods, especially processed foods such as canned soup and pre-made broth. Be aware of this when making your own soups."

          "headline":"Use oil sparingly.",
          "description":"When people make soup, they often use oil liberally. However, depending on the oil you use and the amount you use, this could turn a healthy soup into an unhealthy soup as cooking oil often contain high levels of fat. Use as little oil as possible. Some decent cooking oils you can use include: canola, corn, olive, peanut, safflower, soybean, and sunflower. Avoid oils that have more than 4 grams (0.14 oz) of saturated fat in each tablespoon. Stay away from oils that have partially hydrogenated oil or trans-fat."

          "headline":"Limit dairy products when you can.",
          "description":"While dairy products can enrich a soup and add a creamy quality, you should limit the amount you put into a soup. Ultimately, by limiting the amount of dairy in your soup you\u2019ll also decrease the amount of fat and cholesterol in it. Reduce or cut the amount of dairy in your recipe, if possible. For instance, if your recipe calls for 4 tablespoons of butter, only use 2 or 3. For creamy soups, consider substituting dairy products for soymilk, cashew milk, or even pureed cauliflower or other vegetables. Avoid using recipes that call for a lot of dairy products. Instead, focus on recipes that have minimum amounts of dairy."

Veggie-rich soups will often be low in fat and cholesterol but high in nutritional value. Many veggie-rich soups may have a simpler ingredient list than other soups. For instance, you\u2019ll see a wide variety of vegetables such as celery, peas, and carrots as ingredients. Try Asian-oriented soups like vegetable hot and sour soup or vegetable Thai noodle soup. Think about vegetable soups that are season appropriate. For instance, buy or prepare a squash soup or bean and mushroom soup in the autumn or winter. In summer or spring, make gazpacho."

Stay away from cream of broccoli, cream of mushroom, and cream of corn. Although it might be tasty, don\u2019t eat New England Clam Chowder if you are counting calories. Look for vegan \u201ccream of\u201d soups. You\u2019ll be surprised to find a decent selection of vegan alternatives that use cauliflower, peas, broccoli, or other ingredients to create creamy soups. Focus on tomato-based chowders like Manhattan Clam Chowder."

By eliminating meat broth, you\u2019ll decrease the cholesterol and maybe even the saturated fat content of the soup. In the end, you\u2019ll be able to make your favorite recipe just a bit healthier. Make your own vegetable broth using your favorite vegetables. Use store-vegetable broth to substitute for meat both. For instance, use vegetable broth instead of chicken or beef broth. If you must use meat-based broth, focus on chicken broth. It will likely have less saturated fat and lower cholesterol."
