          "description":"In essence, batch cooking means preparing food ahead of time in large batches. Decide whether or not you want to freeze any of the food you cook, and whether you\u2019d like to create finished meals or simply prep ingredients. Decide how many meals you\u2019d like to make overall, and set aside some time for shopping and cooking. Often batch cooking refers to dinners, but you can use this method to prep breakfasts, lunches, or snacks. If this is your first time doing any kind of batch cooking, you may want to start with just a week\u2019s worth of meals, or less. If you are preparing meals for one week, you can probably knock it out in 1-3 hours, plus shopping time. If you are preparing meals for an entire month, it can take anywhere from 3-6 hours. You may want to split your work up over the course of two days."
