          "headline":"Store foods with less than 10% moisture and low oil for up to 30 years.",
          "description":"Oil and moisture can cause food to go rancid and make you sick. Foods that you can reliably store for decades include dried or dehydrated foods sealed in airtight containers. Examples of the longest-lasting foods include wheat, corn, beans, rice, sugar, oats, flour, pasta, and powdered milk."

          "headline":"Stock canned foods for 2-5 years.",
          "description":"Canned tuna and meats can provide essential protein in an emergency situation and last several years. Canned fruits and vegetables will also last up to 5 years and are rich in vitamins and minerals. Good choices for canned fruits and vegetables include canned tomatoes, pumpkin, whole preserved fruits, and pickles. Canned fruits will be most flavorful if eaten within a year, but can last for 2 years. Check for discoloration or a rancid smell before eating them."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Replace high-fat foods once a year.",
          "description":"Storing oils and fats is important to help make foods more flavorful and provide more energy. They can also help you cook other stored foods. However, fats and oils usually go rancid in around a year. Oil, nuts, dried eggs and nut butters are all high-fat foods that can last for up to a year before they need to be replaced. Coconut oil has a longer shelf life and lasts around 2 years."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Freeze meats for up to one year.",
          "description":"Wrap any meats you intend to save for more than 2 months in heavy-duty foil or plastic wrap. Steaks and roasts last the longest, with a recommended maximum freezing time of 12 months. Fresh poultry lasts around 9 months, while cooked poultry lasts around 6 months. Fish, chops, and organ meats last around 3-4 months. Freeze meats you want to save before the expiration date on the package. Freezing meats will keep them safe indefinitely, but for the best flavor eat them within the recommended window."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Salt and smoke meat for flavorful and long-lasting preservation.",
          "description":"Dry cure hams, bacon, and small cuts of meat using a pre-mixed curing salt, available from specialty grocers and online. Use a brine of sugar, kosher salt, pickling spice, and pink salt to cure other meats. Season meat and place it in a smoker for 6-8 hours to smoke it. Eat cured and smoked meats within 1 year. Cook your cured meats before eating them."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Pickle vegetables to store them for up to 6 months.",
          "description":"Add vegetables such as cucumber, tomatoes, green beans, carrots, and radishes into cans with a 50% water, 50% white vinegar solution. Add in salt, pepper, and dried or fresh herbs to your taste. If there are air bubbles in your pickling brine, throw out the pickles. This means that air and bacteria got into the can."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Dehydrate fruits and vegetables for long-lasting nutrition.",
          "description":"Fruits and vegetables provide essential vitamins and minerals, but in their natural state they don't last long. Use a dehydrator to take all of the moisture out of fruits and vegetables and they can last up to 1 year. Raisins and dried dates can last even longer, but check on them periodically to make sure they aren't going bad. Dried vegetables have about half of the shelf-life as dried fruits. You can also dehydrate nuts and herbs."

          "headline":"Store condiments such as salt, sugar, honey, and stock for 10 years.",
          "description":"Condiments can considerably improve the flavor of food that's been stored away for a long time. Salt and sugar are two basics that last up to 10 years in a sealed container. Instant coffee can also last up to a decade and can provide a caffeine fix in an emergency. Honey can last for hundreds of years. Spices are most flavorful within 6-12 months, but are safe to eat for up to 4 years."

          "description":"Having a few freeze-dried meals on hand can help in the case of a short-term emergency that lasts for a few days. However, its usually a more efficient use of money and space to store ingredients for a long-term emergency. You can buy freeze-dried meals from camping and army supply stores. Some freeze-dried meals can last as long as 20 years. A freeze dried meal can cost anywhere from $3-8 per serving. These meals often need water to rehydrate them and make them edible, so consider storing bottled water alongside them."

          "headline":"Check your stored food for spoilage at least once a year.",
          "description":"Take stock of your storage around once a year so that you know exactly what you have available and what you could replenish. Throw out any cans that are bulging, as this can be a sign that air and bacteria have gotten in. Toss any food that is moldy or smells rancid. Eat any foods that are close to expiring and replace them. This will help ensure that you always have fresh food on hand in case of emergency."

Once you have a 3-day supply of food for each member of your household stored up, you can start to build up your pantry even more. It can be expensive to build up an emergency pantry. Starting with a 72-hour supply and working up to a larger supply is a good way to diffuse the cost over time."

You can buy oxygen absorbers for food storage at big box stores and online. Mason jars are a good choice for long-term storage. You can tape oxygen absorbers to the lid before sealing your food inside. These absorb any oxygen left in an airtight container, which kills pests and bacteria that could cause your food to go bad."

Air can't penetrate the mylar, keeping your food sealed up without any oxygen that could cause it to go bad. Rodents can chew through mylar, so it's best to place the bags into another container, such as a large plastic bin. Vacuum pumps can be an expensive investment."

Label bins with what they contain and when you packaged the foods so that you will know when to check the food for freshness. Foods that you store in soft containers, such as mylar bags or plastic bags should be a high priority for bin storage since rodents can chew through them."

          "description":"Exposure to light over time can cause your food to go bad more quickly. A storage closet that is kept closed or completely opaque storage container will keep your food fresher. Choose opaque, rather than clear, containers for your food. That way, if the room is regularly exposed to light, your food will be less affected. Most basements are cool, dark, and have an out-of-the-way closet you can dedicate to your emergency pantry. If you have a basement, this would be an ideal space."

While there's no need to freeze your foods, storing them at cooler temperatures can help prolong their shelf life. You can extend the shelf life of foods with a low moisture content by almost double by keeping them cool."
