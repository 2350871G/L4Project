Wrap the ends around the rail to hold the bamboo in place. You can purchase packs of chain link wire ties or get 1 ft (0.30 m) galvanized wire from a home improvement center.

Bushes typically range from $15 to $60 apiece. Bushes, trees, and shrubs are a natural \u201cprivacy screen\u201d but they require weekly maintenance and can take a few years to grow to full size.

Also consider if you need a plant that survives well in sunlight, dryer soil, or keeps its color year-round. For example, you can choose an Arborvitae. These hedges are evergreens that can grow tall in front of high fences. Deciduous bushes like North privet and Rose of Sharon lose their leaves in the winter, so you don\u2019t get year-round coverage."

If you leave enough space, your plants will obscure the fence once they reach full size. For instance, expect to leave 6 to 8 in (15 to 20 cm) between trees and 3 to 4 in (7.6 to 10.2 cm) between each shrub. You can also run a string from stake to stake to ensure you plant in a straight line."

Then, widen the hole appropriately so the plant has plenty of room to spread its roots. Avoid planting containers in the ground. Trees and shrubs need to be taken out of the container before planting so the roots can spread. If you are placing a bunch of plants with bare roots, you can dig a trench along the fence to make this easier."

Then, gently press down on the soil with your foot to eliminate air pockets. You do not need to put any compost or other additives into the soil at this time. Compost can be spread over the soil after the first year."

Spray the ground instead of the plant to avoid root rot. To water trees and bushes regularly, place a garden hose nearby and let water drip into the soil for 30 minutes. You can check the soil\u2019s moistness by sticking a pole into the ground. It should slide into the soil without resistance."

Trim the plant evenly along the top and sides, keeping the top wider than the base so light filters down to the lower branches. Trimming shrubs and bushes forces them to grow upwards and keeps them looking neat. For trees like juniper and cedar, you are better off letting the branches grow naturally.
