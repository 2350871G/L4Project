Consider installing a dead bolt on your bedroom door and/or the safe room for extra security. You should also make sure that you have an audible and silent panic alarm in your room that is monitored.

Stock your safe room with things you can use as a weapon in case the intruder makes it in and you are forced to defend yourself, such as a bat. We'll have more to say in later steps about keeping more dangerous weapons such as knives and guns in your safe room. You may also want to consider having food, water, and first aid supplies in your safe room."
