Furthermore, these types of decks don't do as well after you've lost a tower since the enemy can just place troops right on top of your X-Bow/Mortar. You can have a hybrid deck that is half siege/spell-bait but have another win condition as well, such as Miner. Cycle decks rely on out cycling your opponent's defenses to get your win condition to the tower when they don't have it in hand. However, during 2v2, you'll have to out-cycle two players' defenses, which is nearly impossible."

Graveyard is difficult to use because you will have to place it off center of the tower (or you might activate the kings). Hog Rider isn't as good in this game mode since there will be more buildings and troops to counter him. If you want to use hog, use it as a secondary win condition or a punish card for when your opponents over commit on elixir.

Both help you make positive elixir trades, as they can counter something expensive for a small amount of elixir. Skeletons and Ice Spirit are cycle cards. 2 elixir cards like Bats, Spear Goblins, and Fire Spirits are mostly a midpoint between cycle and versatile response.

Overcommitting is when you put too much elixir in one lane (usually for rushing the bridge) and get punished by your opponent's attack since you are not able to defend. This is something that usually comes with more experience in the game; as you play more, you'll get the hang of spending elixir and knowing when to attack and when to defend. If you want to get some damage on the tower at the beginning, play only a small cheap troop to get chip damage. Don't commit to a high-elixir cost card unless you have an elixir advantage or are at 10 elixir."

This is a great example of why looking at your teammate's cards are important. Remember, you can tap and hold their name so you can see their hand. Many people who do this end up never playing their win condition. While in some situations, you might realize that your deck isn't suited to the matchup, but if that isn't the case, how will you win if you never play your main tower-attacking unit?"

In Clash Royale, there is a triangle where swarms beat a single target troop, splash units beat swarms (when placed with some distance), and single target troops beat splash (when placed right on top). This isn't always true, but it works in a lot of situations. You shouldn\u2019t place a Mini P.E.K.K.A. in the middle of a Skeleton Army and you shouldn\u2019t place a Wizard on top of a Mini P.E.K.K.A. The Wizard will also kill the Skeleton Army unless it gets surrounded by the skeletons. So, don't play Skeleton Army around a Valkyrie since it will lose every single time.

If your teammate plays a card behind the king tower, avoid playing another card on the same side, or your opponents could play a Rocket, hitting your tower and both troops. You might be focusing only on spreading troops on your side of the arena, but don't allow the bridge to get your opponents some value either.

If they play a Golem in the back, don't go and play your Giant at the bridge in the opposite lane. Most likely, both pushes will fail since they won't have enough support behind them. Effects such as Rage, Clone, and Heal will work on both of your troops. Do not support their pushes if they are half-baked.

This type of uncoordinated effort never turns out well. If your opponents have already or nearly taken a tower, you know that it will be a 2 tower game. You can then push both lanes as long as you and your teammate are still supporting each other. What you can do is send in a large push (say, Mega Knight, Executioner, Battle Ram, and Royal Ghost) on one lane, and once that's taken your opponents' focus, sneak in a small push on the other tower (say Miner and Minions). It should be strong enough to take the tower to at least half-health, but include cheap and fast troops."

Even troops with a sliver of health can deal a lot of damage when hiding behind a tank. For example, you may defend a Giant Balloon push with Mega Minion, Inferno Dragon, and Tornado. Your troops will still be alive, so why not put a Giant of your own down and make your remaining defensive troops turn into a big threat."

This is something that usually comes with more experience in the game; as you play more, you'll get the hang of spending elixir and knowing when to attack and when to defend. If you want to get some damage on the tower at the beginning, play only a small cheap troop to get chip damage. Don't commit to a high-elixir cost card unless you have an elixir advantage or are at 10 elixir. Don't respond to everything, especially if you don't have the best counter in hand. Remember, you have another person on your side and chances are, they will have a card that can counter your opponents' units. If they have a better counter, then let them play it, but if they are low on elixir/saving up to play an expensive unit you should pick up the slack on defense. This is a great example of why looking at your teammate's cards are important. Remember, you can tap and hold their name so you can see their hand. Many people who do this end up never playing their win condition. While in some situations, you might realize that your deck isn't suited to the matchup, but if that isn't the case, how will you win if you never play your main tower-attacking unit? Know the strengths and weaknesses of each card. This is something you must know to win any match, but it's surprising how many people don't have a grip on this. In Clash Royale, there is a triangle where swarms beat a single target troop, splash units beat swarms (when placed with some distance), and single target troops beat splash (when placed right on top). This isn't always true, but it works in a lot of situations. You shouldn\u2019t place a Mini P.E.K.K.A. in the middle of a Skeleton Army and you shouldn\u2019t place a Wizard on top of a Mini P.E.K.K.A. The Wizard will also kill the Skeleton Army unless it gets surrounded by the skeletons. So, don't play Skeleton Army around a Valkyrie since it will lose every single time. Don't place P.E.K.K.A. under a Minion Horde because it will always die. Hover your cards before playing. Especially in the case of spells, you should hover your card where you\u2019re going to place it so your teammate can support your attack or knows not to place their card too. If a Goblin Barrel is coming, get your Log ready ahead of time, so that you and your teammate don\u2019t waste elixir (and not have a counter) by both playing a spell. This also applies to Miner pushes (hover your Miner), Rockets, buildings, tanks played in the back, and more. Basically, if you have time to hover a card, you should do it. Space your cards out. There will be twice as many cards on the same size arena, so you will need to avoid bunching your troops together. A spell can get very good value if you don\u2019t. If your teammate plays a card behind the king tower, avoid playing another card on the same side, or your opponents could play a Rocket, hitting your tower and both troops. You might be focusing only on spreading troops on your side of the arena, but don't allow the bridge to get your opponents some value either. A spell can be placed anywhere so you should always space your cards out. Support your teammate\u2019s attacks and defense. This is a 2 player game mode and pushing separately will lead to your 1 person push being easily countered by a 2 player defense. Attack together and support each other with spells when needed. Check whenever you can on the amount of elixir your teammate has and the cards in their hand. If they play a Golem in the back, don't go and play your Giant at the bridge in the opposite lane. Most likely, both pushes will fail since they won't have enough support behind them. Effects such as Rage, Clone, and Heal will work on both of your troops. Do not support their pushes if they are half-baked. If they place a knight at the bridge and you are only at half elixir, don\u2019t play anything to support it. Save your elixir to defend the remaining troops from the incoming defense. Know when to split your damage into two lanes. Most of the time this is discouraged as it turns into you pushing one lane while your teammate tries to push the other. This type of uncoordinated effort never turns out well. If your opponents have already or nearly taken a tower, you know that it will be a 2 tower game. You can then push both lanes as long as you and your teammate are still supporting each other. What you can do is send in a large push (say, Mega Knight, Executioner, Battle Ram, and Royal Ghost) on one lane, and once that's taken your opponents' focus, sneak in a small push on the other tower (say Miner and Minions). It should be strong enough to take the tower to at least half-health, but include cheap and fast troops. Counter push after defending. This is when you support your leftover troops from a defense and turn them into a threatening push by adding a tank or win condition at the front. Even troops with a sliver of health can deal a lot of damage when hiding behind a tank. For example, you may defend a Giant Balloon push with Mega Minion, Inferno Dragon, and Tornado. Your troops will still be alive, so why not put a Giant of your own down and make your remaining defensive troops turn into a big threat. Don't repeat the same move if it didn't work out before. If you played Musketeer in the back and it was rocketed, don't do it again. If you played Hog Rider at the bridge twice and don't get a swing on the tower, please don't repeat it. Instead, wait for full elixir and build up a large push with your teammate's support. Once you realize your opponents have a Rocket (or even Lightning, Fireball, and Poison), play your squishy troops where you'd normally place a building, or play them in front of the crown towers. Don't place them in the back unless you are sure their spell is out of cycle.",
