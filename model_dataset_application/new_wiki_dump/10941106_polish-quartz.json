          "description":"Add a few drops of dish soap to a glass of water. Dip a rag or a small brush (such as an old toothbrush) into the water. Scrub the rock with the soap solution until you remove all the dirt and grime left from digging them out of the ground. Rinse them well when you're done and let them air dry."

          "headline":"Scrub off any iron deposits with an abrasive powder and brush.",
          "description":"If your crystals are \"stained\" red with iron, you may need to scrub them a little harder than if they just have dirt on them. Try an aluminum or steel scrubbing brush, and scrub these areas thoroughly with a scouring powder, such as pumice. Identify stained quartz by finding the red and brown patches on the crystals. Quartz is a very strong stone, and it will hold up to scouring while you scrub the red away."

        {
          "headline":"Grind away the roughest edges with a small rotary tool after the stone is clean.",
          "description":"If your quartz has large pieces you want to remove, cut off them off by sawing through them with a cutting wheel. Place the edge of the wheel against the part you want to cut away, then apply gentle pressure to grind through it. Don't press too hard, as you could harm yourself or the tool. For sharp edges in areas you don't want, use a grinding tool to wear away at the edge. Also, take the time to \"shape\" the stone into roughly what you want the final stone to look like; grind off any areas you don't want. Use diamond-crusted or edged tools for this project, as quartz is very hard. Put on goggles and protective gloves to protect yourself."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Sand the stone down to begin polishing it, starting with very coarse sandpaper.",
          "description":"Pick a very coarse, hard sandpaper for the first round, such as a 50 grit. Work on sanding down the stone's rough edges. As they get smoother, use finer sandpaper, such as 150-grit, and sand it again. Keep moving down to progressively finer paper until the stone is fairly smooth. At the end, use very fine grit sandpaper."

          "headline":"Polish the stones with a rough fabric.",
          "description":"Rub the stone thoroughly with the fabric, working on it until you start to see it shine. Quartz has a natural luster, so it should pick up a shine fairly quickly. Denim, corduroy, or upholstery fabric work well for this."

Keep in mind that each stone will lose about 30% of its mass. For home use, you have the options of a toy rock tumbler with a plastic barrel or a hobby tumbler. For quartz, a hobby tumbler is better as it is a tough rock to tumble."
