      "description":"In mundane, non-piratey MMORPG language, an ocean would be called a \"server\". The oceans are distinct and separate. Subscriber Ocean: A subscriber ocean is an ocean in which a user has to pay for a subscription regularly to enjoy the game completely. Subscription has to be bought using real money and not the virtual game money (PoE). Subscription can be bought on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. The Cerulean Ocean is the only subscriber ocean open for players. It was formed through a merger of the former Midnight and Cobalt Oceans on January 31st, 2012. Doubloon Oceans: Doubloon oceans do not require a subscription. But players playing on doubloon oceans use two types of in-game currency: PoE and doubloons. PoE can be earnt by doing various activities in the game. Doubloons can either be exchanged for PoE or bought using real money. Many users who decide not to spend real money on this game choose doubloon oceans. The Emerald Ocean is a doubloon ocean that was formed through a merger of the former Sage and Hunter Oceans on January 31st, 2012. The emerald is currently the most populated ocean in the game. The Meridian Ocean is a doubloon ocean that was formed through a merger of the former Malachite and Viridian Oceans on January 31st, 2012. Meridian is the oldest, and the second most populated ocean in the game. The Opal Ocean was the fourth doubloon ocean and opened on December 8th 2006. Opal is a German language ocean. Being a German language ocean, Opal ocean is scarcely populated. The Jade Ocean was the sixth doubloon ocean and opened on July 1, 2009. Jade is a Spanish language ocean. The population of the Jade ocean is similar to the one of Opal ocean. Most players prefer to play on Doubloon Oceans as almost everything can be played for free. Even doubloons can be bought in exchange for PoE, the basic monetary unit. PoE can be earnt by playing different puzzles, winning tournaments, events, blockades, pillages, stalls, etc."
