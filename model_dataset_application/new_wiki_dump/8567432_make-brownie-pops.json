Make the most of your time while your oven heats by moving on in this recipe and preparing other parts of it. If your kitchen is especially hot, or if it is a particularly hot day, this can increase the temperature of your oven. In instances like these, use an oven thermometer to verify the temperature before baking."

Beat the mix thoroughly until it is smooth and consistent throughout. If you don\u2019t have a whisk, you can use a fork in place of this kitchen implement, or you can improvise a whisk with chopsticks."

When the edges are firm and the middle of the baked batter is set, your brownies are done baking. Remove them from the oven and allow them to cool for one hour. A hot pan can cause heat damage to your counters and tabletops. Be sure you use potholders to prevent heat damage to your home."
