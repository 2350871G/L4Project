          "description":"Instead of opening a can of cranberry sauce, simmer a 12 oz (340 g) bag of fresh cranberries with 2/3 to 1 cup (150 to 200 g) of sugar and 1 cup (240 ml) of water or orange juice. Stir and heat the mixture for about 15 minutes over medium heat. Then, let the sauce cool before you serve it.Variation: To make cranberry jam, keep cooking the sauce for an extra 5 minutes or until it's very thick. Then, strain the jam through a fine-mesh strainer to remove the seeds. If you like smoother cranberry sauce, let it cool completely and then blend it until it's as smooth as you like. You can also mix in 1/4 teaspoon (0.5 g) of ground cinnamon and the zest of an orange for additional flavor."
