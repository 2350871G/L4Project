  "text":" Making the Edible Ornaments Get a large sized bowl. Add the butter and sugar into the bowl before creaming them together until the mixture is smooth. T Beat in the eggs and vanilla.  Stir in the flour, baking soda, and salt.  Cover the bowl with the mixed ingredients, then chill it for at least an hour or overnight. This will be your dough. Preheat your oven to 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C) after the bowl's contents are chilled for a considerable amount of time.  Roll out the chilled dough on a floured surface. The dough needs to be a little bit thick. Cut out the dough with a Christmas cookie-cutter(s).  Layer it with one more cookie.  Bake the cookies for 6-8 minutes in the oven.  Set the cookies on a wire rack to cool once they have finished baking. Do not remove them until they are completely cooled. Icing For the Edible Ornaments Add 1/2 cup of powdered sugar into a bowl.  Pour in 1 tsp of vanilla carefully.  Pour 1/4 cup of milk with the sugar and vanilla. Mix it all together, then add a little more milk, but not too much! Mix in food coloring of any color you desire. Note that the color you choose will be the icing's color. Hanging the Ornaments Take a knife and carefully cut a small hole into each cookie. Try not to make the hole too near the edge, or your cookie may crumble. Try to go for the center or near the top. If your cookies are not properly baked, they could easily crumble. Slip a string through the hole in each cookie. You could have an individual string for each cookie, or string a whole bunch of them together - this is all up to you.
