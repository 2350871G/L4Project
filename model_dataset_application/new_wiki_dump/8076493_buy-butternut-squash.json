          "description":"Butternut squash should be a uniform tan color on the outside and bright orange on the inside. Since most butternut squash is sold whole, you'll need to look at the skin when choosing your squash. The skin should be hard and dull. You should also see at least 1-inch of stem on the squash. If the butternut squash is shiny, it may have been coated with wax to make it last longer or it may not be ripe yet."

          "description":"You'll probably notice that butternut squash come in a variety of sizes. Because of this, there's no exact weight that the squash should weigh. Instead, the squash should feel heavy for its size. For example, a small or skinny butternut squash that's ripe might only weigh a pound while a large, rounder squash might weigh more like 3 or 4 pounds."

          "description":"Look over the entire squash to make sure there are no cracks or soft spots. Soft spots means that the squash is overly ripe and may start to mold. You should also make sure there is no visible mold on the outside of the butternut squash. The butternut squash should be perfectly smooth, although you might find a slight rough spot where the butternut squash rested on the ground as it grew."

Try to find a storage place like a basement or closet where it won't be exposed to sunlight or high humidity. You can store a whole butternut squash for 2 to 3 months. Avoid storing your butternut squash on the cellar floor or stacked. Doing so can introduce moisture and prevent air movement. These can cause your squash to rot."

Use a vegetable peeler or paring knife to peel each section of the butternut squash. If you're roasting a butternut squash, you won't need to peel it."

If so, put the leftover cut (but uncooked) butternut squash into an air-tight container or sealable plastic bag. You can refrigerate the cut squash for up to 4 days. Try to use the cut butternut squash as soon as you can since it begins to lose freshness and nutrients after you cut it."

Place the cubed pieces of squash on a large rimmed baking sheet and place the sheet in the freezer. Let the pieces of squash freeze completely (about 2 hours). Transfer the frozen squash to a large freezer bag and store it in the freezer for 6 to 12 months. Remember to label the bag so you know what's inside it and when you originally froze it."
