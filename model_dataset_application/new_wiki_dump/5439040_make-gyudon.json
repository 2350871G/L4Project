          "description":"Use a sharp knife to shave the beef into very thin slices. Cut the onion and shiitake mushrooms into moderately thin slices, as well. To save yourself time and effort, ask the butcher to slice the beef very thinly before packaging it. If the butcher does not slice the beef, freeze it for 1 hour before slicing it yourself. Partially frozen meat is easier to cut than fully thawed meat. The slices of beef should be just a little thicker than cold cut lunchmeat is. This thinness is key. Beef that is too thick will not cook quickly enough. The slices of onion and mushroom should both be approximately 1/3 inch (1 cm) thick."

Use cooking chopsticks or tongs to carefully separate the beef slices as they cook. Doing so can help prevent the beef from sticking together. This may seem like an abnormally short cooking time, but if the beef has been sliced to an adequately thin size, it should be plenty. Do not overcook the beef since it can easily become dry."

          "description":"Top each serving of gyudon with an organic raw egg. Crack the egg directly over the beef, allowing the yolk to remain intact in the center of the bowl when you serve the dish. Please exercise caution when consuming raw eggs. Organic eggs from a clean, reliable source might be safe to eat, but the USDA discourages the consumption of raw eggs altogether due to the risk of salmonella. If you feel squeamish about consuming raw eggs, you may skip this step. If you do opt to include the raw egg, mix it into the beef and rice as you eat the gyudon. Doing so can give the taste of the dish a rich, creamy undertone."

          "description":"Gyudon is frequently topped with a bit of shichimi togarashi and beni shoga. Pair it with sides like miso soup and steamed vegetables. A combination of broccoli, cauliflower, and sliced carrots will pair especially well with this dish, but you can serve it with any vegetables you prefer. Consider steaming the vegetables for a few minutes, allowing them to become tender-crisp without turning into mush."

The strips should also be about 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) long. Cut them on a diagonal for the best texture and appearance. Note that these strips of beef are slightly thicker than the slices called for in traditional gyudon, so they will need to be cooked for a slightly longer period of time.
