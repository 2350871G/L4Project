          "description":"Cutting the tip off, or \u201cpointing\u201d the cheese, is considered to be a faux pas. The tastiest part of the brie is the tip. When you cut that part off for yourself, you\u2019re basically telling everyone else, \u201call mine!\u201d Keep the brie triangular-shaped, cutting along its edge. If the rind doesn\u2019t appeal to you, cut the cheese at more of an angle to maximize the amount of \u201cinside\u201d you get. No one will notice as long as you preserve the triangular shape of the brie. Go on and take part of the rind! If you\u2019re cutting brie the right way, each slice will have some on it. If you cut across the brie to remove the tip, you inevitably leave behind a slice that is all rind."

        {
          "headline":"Eat the rind along with the rest of the cheese.",
          "description":"Everyone wonders what they are supposed to do with that hard shell on cheese, but a brie rind is safe to eat. Don\u2019t try scraping out the inside to avoid the rind. That would be like taking the meat out of a sandwich and throwing away the bread. Brie rind is crumbly and has a slightly bitter taste, but it isn\u2019t too distracting from the cheese\u2019s gooey goodness. If you haven\u2019t tried the rind before, go for it! The rind isn\u2019t for everyone. Keep in mind it tastes worse as the brie goes bad, so be sure to try it on a fresh slice."

        {
          "headline":"Peel the rind off a slice of cheese if you don\u2019t want it.",
          "description":"Some people don\u2019t like the rind and that\u2019s okay, but wait until you have the slice of cheese on your plate before removing it. Do your best to peel it off by hand. Brie is soft and sticky, so separating the rind isn\u2019t the easiest thing in the world. Try cutting the top off to make the rest easier to remove or eat around it if you have to. When you\u2019re serving brie at home, you can cut off the rind ahead of time. Freeze the cheese for about 30 minutes, then slice off the rind with a sharp knife. Don\u2019t remove the rind if you\u2019re serving the cheese to guests, since some of them may want it."

          "headline":"Throw away the cheese if it smells like ammonia.",
          "description":"Brie generally keeps for a couple of weeks until it is opened, and after that, it lasts a week or less. The rind turns gray and flaky as the cheese spoils. Green and pink mold spots are things you don\u2019t want anywhere near your mouth. The inside of the cheese turns gooey and has a nasty chemical smell as it goes bad. Underripe brie feels hard to the touch. It has a hard outer rind with a springy inside. Overripe brie turns soft and runny. Brie stops aging after you slice it, so eat is as soon as possible to avoid having it spoil on you. If you have to store it, wrap it up in parchment or wax paper and keep it in a refrigerator drawer away from moisture. Freezing generally isn\u2019t recommended unless you\u2019re going to use it in dishes where the texture doesn\u2019t matter, such as in soups and casseroles. It will last up to 6 months in a freezer-safe container. Thaw it in the refrigerator, cold water, or the microwave until it softens."

          "description":"Take it out of your refrigerator and let it settle. It turns nice and creamy so you get the most out of its flavor. Warming it a little reduces any of the ammonia taste you might get from a slice you have had in the refrigerator for a few days. You could also heat it to make it gooey on the inside. Heat it for about 1 minute in a microwave on a high setting until it\u2019s soft in the center. In an oven, heat it at 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) for about 5 minutes or until it reaches the consistency you desire."

          "description":"If you bought a wedge, it is simple enough to serve by plopping it on a tray with a knife. A lot of brie is sold as a wheel, so cut out a wedge to get the party started. Slice from the rind to the center of the brie with a narrow cheese knife. Keep the slice relatively small, about 1 in (2.5 cm) or less depending on the serving size you desire. Cutting brie is a lot like cutting apple pie, but making the first cut into a beautiful wheel can be intimidating when you\u2019re a guest. Cut a slice to give guests a sample to go by. When you\u2019re cutting down a wedge of cheese, always cut along the sides from the center to the rind. Don\u2019t cut off the pointed tip, the tastiest part of brie."

          "headline":"Place the cheese on plain bread or crackers to enjoy its basic taste.",
          "description":"Rip off a piece of a baguette or another crusty bread and put the brie on top of it. The French traditionally eat brie this way since plain bread doesn\u2019t compete with the delicious flavors of the cheese. Throw the cheese on top of the bread and pop it in your mouth. You don\u2019t need to spread the cheese at all. Brie is soft and creamy as is, so put it on something of a similar size and enjoy it."

          "headline":"Pair the cheese with sweet fruit or nuts to complement its flavors.",
          "description":"If you can resist shoving an entire slice into your mouth as soon as you cut it, combine it with other delicious things. The most traditional pairing is a slightly acidic fruit like apples, grapes, and pears. Both fresh and dried fruit goes well with brie. You could also try unsalted pecans, candied walnuts, and a little honey. Preserves are always great to spread on brie. Any type of preserve or jam works, but the best kinds are sweet and acidic, such as cherries, mixed berries, and figs. If you\u2019re looking for more party options, arrange your own charcuterie board. Create a tasting tour out of meats like salami and prosciutto. Add a variety of cheeses, such as a nutty manchego and a crumbly blue cheese."

          "headline":"Select a fruity or acidic drink to pair with brie.",
          "description":"You\u2019re eating a French cheese, so you can\u2019t go wrong with a nice French champagne. Sweet, tart wines like pinot noir go well with brie, but you could also grab a hearty beer. If you\u2019re not drinking alcohol, consider pouring a fruit juice like grape or apple to complement the cheese\u2019s soft flavor. Soft cheeses like brie tend to pair well with dry, fruity wines like riesling, marsannnay, or viognier. A lighter red wine like a pinot noir works well too on account of its delicate yet rich flavor that contrasts the mellow cheese. If you\u2019re more of a white wine kind of person, look for something dry and acidic. The herby taste of a nice sauvignon blanc goes well with a slice of brie. For beers, strong but inoffensive brews like scotch ales, stouts, and porters are good choices. You could also go for something lighter and fruitier, such as a pilsner."

Wait for it to soften and bubble a little. If you leave it in for too long, it could liquefy into a mess, so check on it often. Add toppings before or after you heat the brie in the oven. Some toppings to try include fruit preserves, honey, fresh herbs, and crumbled nuts. You could make a dippable brie by cutting the top rind off the cheese.
