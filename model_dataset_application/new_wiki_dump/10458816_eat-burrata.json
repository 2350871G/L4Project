This will ensure that the creamy center of the burrata is not too solid. You can also put your cheese in a bowl of warm water for 10 minutes to warm it up.

Drizzle a small amount of high-quality olive oil onto the burrata and sprinkle a bit of salt on top to enhance the burrata\u2019s flavor. Wait to cut into the burrata until you serve it so everyone can immediately dig in to the fresh curd. Adjust the amount of salt you add based on your own preferences. Burrata doesn\u2019t have a strong flavor to begin with, but if you\u2019re only getting a mild milk flavor and not much else, a small amount of salt can help the flavor stand out more."

Use toasted bread, or one with a tougher crust, to get a nice contrast in textures with the creamy burrata. The cheese\u2019s mild flavor also pairs excellently with the saltiness of cured meats like prosciutto. To toast bread, slice a baguette into \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) slices and bake for 5 minutes at 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C). Flip over each slice, bake another 5 minutes, and brush with olive oil once it\u2019s done. You can also brush slices of bread with olive oil and heat them in a griddle pan or skillet until they\u2019re lightly browned."
