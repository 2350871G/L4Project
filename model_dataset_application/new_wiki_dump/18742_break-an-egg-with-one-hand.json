If some shell dropped in after you cracked the egg, you can remove it with a fork after discarding the rest of your shells."

That way, you can break eggs two-handed! Professional cooks often break eggs two at a time to cut preparation time from recipes, but you can do it to impress family members when you are making scrambled eggs."
