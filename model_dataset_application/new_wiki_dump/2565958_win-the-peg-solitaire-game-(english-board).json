This arrow covers the whole center area. The trick is, we can clear each of the four sides the same way, so we only have to memorize the steps once.  First move is going from right to the left into the middle hole. The full board is shown here. Now we are going to clear a side area. This way is always the same. We are clearing the right side. We take the peg from the top down: This is an important move. It is the first move of starting the right side area. Now we go from the corner towards the middle:  And we move from the bottom right corner to the upper right corner:  Now we want to go and rescue the lonely peg in the corner.

Now you see, we need to clear the right area again  and we do it in the same steps. So you can compare the steps above and below now. So we take it down from the top. Remember, this our first step in the process. Going out of the corner to the left.  Move in the corner again from below.  Rescue the lonesome peg in the corner.  And take it back towards the center again. Wow! Let's consider this area cleared. Let's turn it again 90\u00b0 to the right!  Same procedure again. From top down (1st step) : From the corner to the inside.  From the bottom upward to the corner.  Go and get the corner peg.  And back in the middle. Consider the area cleared. Let's rotate again 90\u00b0 to the right. OK, one side left to clear.  Down from the top (1st).  To the center.  From bottom right corner up in the corner.  Now we go and get our friend in the corner again.  And get the poor peg towards the center.  We turn 90\u00b0.  Now we have the famous arrow pointing left.  We go with the peg one behind the arrow's head one circle around the arrow: Up, Right, Down twice, Left and Up again.  This is the position after doing the circle around the arrow: a lying T-figure.  From there, you take the center peg up, the left peg to the center, then the bottom two pegs up and then the two remaining pegs down.  We solved our game with one peg in center remaining. Please note that the remaining peg is the peg that made the very first move in the game. Congratulations!
