Examples of three-element monsters you can choose are the Congle, the Bowgart, the Spunge, and the Thumpies. For the best chance of creating the Grumpyre, pair the Deedge with the Congle. Breed the Deedge by pairing monsters that provide equal parts of the elements Air, Plant, Water, and Cold. Examples of successful monster pairings that can breed the Deedge are Spunge + Mammott, Thumpies + Toe Jammer, and Congle + Potbelly. Breed the Congle by pairing monsters that provide equal parts of the elements Air, Water, and Cold. Examples of successful monster pairings that can breed the Congle are Tweedle + Maw, Toe Jammer + Pango, and Mammott + Quibble."
