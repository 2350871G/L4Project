The Gregg shorthand method is phonetic, so it follows the sound of words, rather than the spelling of words. It uses hooks and circles as symbols for words. Like the Pitman method, it has a separate set of symbols for consonants and vowels. You can find the Gregg shorthand alphabet here: http://www.omniglot.com/writing/shorthand.htm. Use the correct shape and length for the consonant symbols. Each consonant is represented by a hook that is a different shape and length. Some consonants, like \u201cn\u201d or \u201cm,\u201d are straight vertical lines. Other consonants, like \u201cf\u201d or \u201cv,\u201d are more horizontal and curved. Study each consonant to ensure you are writing it correctly. In some cases, multiple consonants are represented with one symbol based on the sound of the word, such as the sound \u201cn-d\u201d in \u201cand\u201d or \u201cm-n\u201d in \u201cmen.\u201d Represent vowels with circles. The Gregg method uses circles of different sizes to notate the vowel sounds in words. Common vowels like \u201ca\u201d are represented by a large circle, while vowels like \u201ce\u201d are represented by a smaller circle. Make sure you notate vowel sounds correctly with circles, rather than just how the vowel appears written in the word. For example, the vowel sound \u201coo\u201d is represented by an open circle at the bottom. The vowel sound \u201cea\u201d is represented by a circle with a dot in the center. Use the proper punctuation marks in Gregg shorthand. Punctuation marks like a period, a question mark, and a hyphen are represented by different symbols in Gregg shorthand. The symbol for the punctuation mark should appear above the bottom line of the page. For example, a period is represented by a small dash and a question mark is represented by a small \u201cx.\u201d\nA complete list of shorthand for punctuation marks can be found here: http://www.omniglot.com/writing/shorthand.htm. Improving Your Shorthand Use an ink pen or a sharp pencil. Shorthand is easier to write if you have a writing utensil that glides smoothly across the page. Avoid pens that leak a lot of ink or a pencil with a dull point. Take a course in shorthand writing. Improve your shorthand by taking a class taught by a veteran shorthand writer. Look for a shorthand writing class at your local community college, writing center, or online. The course can teach you how to speed up your shorthand and make it more legible on the page. If you do better with one on one instruction, look for a shorthand tutor at your local writing center or online. Schedule regular tutoring sessions so your shorthand can improve. Practice your shorthand regularly. Try practicing shorthand at least once a day. Get in the habit of using shorthand in class or during an interview so you can get better at it. Write each letter of the shorthand on flashcards and use the cards to help you practice. Have a copy of the shorthand alphabet handy so you can refer to it as needed.",
