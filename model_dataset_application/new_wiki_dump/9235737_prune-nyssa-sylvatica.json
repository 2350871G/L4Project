This model will provide better stability on uneven ground than other types of ladder, making it a safer choice. Buy a taller model of ladder, as three-legged aluminum ladders generally range from six to sixteen feet tall (approximately two to five meters tall). Orchard ladders may be purchased a local hardware store. For added security, have someone on the ground below to brace the ladder while you are pruning."

This cut should reduce the length of the stub as much as possible without harming the stem collar. Avoid leaving any stubs on your trees, as they can cause decay over time and damage the rest of the tree. They are also unsightly, especially in winter when your tree loses its leaves."

To create more space directly under trees, however, you can trim lower branches. Remove lower branches until the remaining branches create the kind of canopy effect you are aiming for. For instance, if you wish to place a picnic table under a Nyssa Sylvatica tree, remove lower branches until the lowest branches of the tree are approximately  seven or eight feet above the ground."
