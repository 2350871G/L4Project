To keep your spray painted object in good shape, apply a urethane-based finish coating after you're satisfied with its color. Typically, finishes are applied with a spray can as well. If you're using matte spray paint, you may want to use a similarly matte finish (and vice versa for gloss spray paints and finishes)."

If you're looking to spray paint your item multiple colors, white and gold is a classic option. You might, for example, spray paint the exterior of a decorative pot gold and the interior white. Add splash of vibrancy to white and gold objects by decorating them with a bright colored item like red, orange, teal, violet, or pink."

If you want your spray painting job to look as realistic as possible, take time to do several coats of spray paint. After each coat, check the color and decide whether it's strong enough for your tastes or could use an extra layer. Allow each coat to dry completely before adding another coat. This should take 12-24 hours, depending on the brand. Check the spray paint's instructions for a specific time."

Pick 1 or 2 objects at most to spray paint gold so your decorations stay tasteful. If you already spray painted your coffee table gold, for example, you may not want to spray paint your chairs or picture frames gold as well."
