The steps below will find a rough estimate of kWh from this number, but your actual kWh usage is usually lower. Some devices show a range of watts, such as \"200\u2013300W.\" It may be more accurate to choose the middle of this range, or 250W in this example."

Calculating Kilowatt Hours from Amps and Voltage Find the amps rating on your appliance. Some appliance labels do not list watts. In this situation, look for an amp or \"A\" measurement instead. Laptop and phone chargers may list two amp values. Use the one labeled input. Find the voltage in your region. In the United States and a few other countries, the standard household voltage is 120V.

Multiply the wattage by the number of hours the device runs during an average day.

Example: 390 watt hours / day \u00f7 1000 watts / kilowatt = 0.39 kilowatt hours per day. Multiply to find the kilowatt hours for a larger time period.

Example: 0.39 kilowatt hours / day x 31 days = 12.09 kilowatt hours. Using a Power Meter Purchase a power meter online. Also called a watt meter or kilowatt meter, this device measures the actual power your appliance uses. This is typically more accurate than using the appliance's label info. If you're familiar with electrician's tools, you may be able to use a multimeter instead. This requires access to the appliance's wiring while it is plugged in. Needless to say, don't disassemble anything unless you know what you're doing. Plug the meter between the outlet and the appliance. Plug the power meter into the wall. Plug the appliance into the power meter. Measure the kilowatt hours. Set your power meter to display kilowatt hours. As long as you keep the power meter connected, it should calculate the total kilowatt hours of the attached appliance. If your power meter only measures watts, you can use the method above to calculate kilowatt hours from that measurement. Refer to the power meter instructions if you're not sure how to change its settings. Use the appliance as you would normally. The longer you leave the power meter plugged in, the more accurate its calculation will be. Find your monthly or annual kilowatt hours. The kilowatt hours displayed on the meter is a running total from the time the device was plugged in. You can multiply this number to estimate your kWh over a longer time period. For example, let's say the meter has been running for 5 days, and you want to find the 30-day estimate. 30 divided by 5 is 6, so multiply the kWh displayed by 6.",
