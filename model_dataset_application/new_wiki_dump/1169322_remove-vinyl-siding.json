If you are going to throw it away, or recycle it, park a truck nearby, so you can throw the siding directly into it for removal from your property. However you decide to pile the siding up, pieces are often 10-12 feet long, so make sure you have a large enough space.

          "description":"Find a stable piece of ground to set up a ladder on. Make sure it reaches to the highest piece of vinyl siding that you need to remove. If the ladder is the type that leans against the house, make sure to place it at a 45-degree angle for the most stable setup. When working on a ladder, it\u2019s always good to have a partner standing by to help you balance. If you are only removing one piece of siding and you can reach it from the ground, a ladder is not necessary. If you are removing an entire wall, it\u2019s best to start removing the siding from the top because of how the pieces are connected."
