If you don't have any hydrogen peroxide at home, you can use club soda instead. White vinegar will also work in a pinch. Light can turn hydrogen peroxide into water. If it is very bright in your room, cover the treated area with plastic wrap, then drape a dark towel over it. The towel will hide the area from light, and the plastic wrap will prevent the towel from soaking up the hydrogen peroxide."
