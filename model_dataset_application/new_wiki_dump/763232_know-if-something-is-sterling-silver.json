If your item contains a sterling silver quality mark, it must also contain the maker's hallmark.

The United Kingdom, France, and the United States of America each have a distinct marking system. American sterling silver is marked with one of the following hallmarks: \u201c925,\u201d \u201c.925,\u201d or \u201cS925.\u201d the 925 indicates that the piece contains 92.5% silver and 7.5% other metals. Sterling silver items made in the UK contain a stamp of a lion. In addition to this stamp, UK made items will also contain a town mark, a duty mark, a date letter, and a sponsor's mark. These marks will vary from item to item. France currently marks its sterling silver items with the head of Minerva (92.5% and below) or a vase (99.9% pure silver)."
