It gives your drink a tropical edge, much like your favorite coconut-chocolate bar. You can also add a dash of cream or half-n-half for more richness."

          "description":"This advice may sound a bit crazy, but if you're making a large pot of hot chocolate, try adding a banana peel to it while you cook it. The banana peel will give your hot chocolate a banana flavor. Just toss it out at the end. You can also use orange peel for a similar effect."

Make sure to keep stirring until it's well blended. This addition will also make your hot chocolate extra rich. If you don't like peanut butter, you can try any other nut butter. You can even use chocolate hazelnut spread."

Either way, make sure to stir them in well. You may need to let the chocolate sit in the hot beverage for a minute or two before stirring."

Whichever way you choose, just dollop on as much as you want. To make your own whipped cream, add heavy whipping cream, a touch of sugar, and a touch of vanilla extract to a bowl.
