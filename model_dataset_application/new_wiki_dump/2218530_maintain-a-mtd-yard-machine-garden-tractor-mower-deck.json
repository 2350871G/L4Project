NOTE: The part names (typically capitalized) specified in this wikiHow are the proper names used by the OEM directly from their parts manual to assist the owner should components require replacement. Lower the mower deck assembly down to its bottom setting. Insure that the weight of the deck is now fully resting on the deck wheels. NOTE: A method of support under the lip of the deck maybe necessary to insure that the Deck's full weight has been taken off the tractor's frame. Remove the rear support pins, with a pair of pliers. Pull the (2)-3/8\" cotter pins out of the rear deck bracket followed by the (2)-1/2\" flat washers.

Disconnect the brake cable located on the right-hand side of the mowing deck by removing the 1/4\" hex nut with a 7/16\" wrench. Move the cable out of the way to prevent it from snagging on the deck as it is being removed. Un-mount the rear of the mowing deck from the tractor by disconnecting the two(2)-deck links from the rear deck bracket. CAUTION! If the deck is not properly supported when the links are disconnected, the deck will drop down causing possible personal injury or damage to the deck assembly. Un-mount the front of the mowing deck from the tractor by disconnecting the two(2)-Deck Links from the two front deck brackets. CAUTION! If the deck is not properly supported when the links are disconnected, the deck will drop down causing possible personal injury or damage to the deck assembly. Remove the mowing deck, while lifting the deck stabilizer out of its mounting tray on the front of the mowing deck, slowly slide the deck itself out from underneath the tractor. Once the assembly has cleared, allow the stabilizer to drop back down. The mowing deck is now available for servicing. Reinstallation of Mowing Deck Assembly Perform any periodic maintenance needed to keep your mower in tip-top working shape. Prior to reassembly, perform any necessary periodic maintenance to the deck assembly such as replacement of blades, belts, or bearings. Clean any debris or entangled material from the spindles and blades. Perform any necessary lubrication to linkages, brackets, and insure that all springs used on the deck are in good operating condition. Re-assemble and remount the mowing deck onto the tractor. Reassembly of the mowing deck and re-mounting onto the tractor is opposite of the above procedures. Insure that all components designated by the OEM have been either reinstalled or replaced as necessary. Maintenance of Idler Spring Assembly Replace the idler spring. The idler spring (aka simply the \"extension spring\" by the OEM) is a 6.17\" extension spring connecting the idler bracket assembly to a stationary 1/4\" x 1-3/4\" hex bolt mounted onto the mowing deck assembly. This spring, because of its location is typically exposed to the elements and will periodically require replacement. Remove the idler spring. Due to the orientation of how the idler spring is mounted onto the idler bracket (the Spring is attached to the Bracket from the underside) turn the bracket assembly counter-clockwise until the spring clears the deck surface and then can be removed. NOTE: When turning the bracket assembly there was noticeable friction between the bracket and the deck indicating something amiss. Take note of the following optional steps that deviate from the standard OEM assembly. Un-mount the V-belt. : After turning the bracket Assembly, unmount the V-belt from between the idler and #2-Pulley. OPTIONAL STEP:  See SHORTCUT #02 in the \"Tips\" section below for details. Remove the idler assembly. Using a 9/16\" wrench remove the 3/8\" hex nut that secures the idler bracket assembly to the deck assembly. This is followed by removing the 3/8\" flat washer, the Shield Spacer, and finally the 3/8\" x 1\" hex bolt. OPTIONAL STEP:  See SHORTCUT #02 in the \"Tips\" section below for details. Inspect for damage incurred. When the idler assembly is removed, check the mowing deck surface for scoring or damage caused by the Bracket coming into contact. Damage or scoring indicates either a misaligned or damaged bracket. It is also possible that this is an indication of an \"erroneous\" assembly by the factory. Refer to SHORTCUT #02 in the \"Tips\" section below for details. Insert the 3/8\" x 1\" idler assembly mounting bolt through the mowing deck from underneath. Insure that the bolt-head is flush against the metal surface of the mower deck and that there is no debris underneath. Mount the idler assembly down onto its mounting bolt. Make sure that its orientation is correct with the idler pulley being towards the front of the deck. Slip the spacer down onto the mounting bolt and seat it down and onto the face of the idler bracket, With the wider portion of the shield spacer on top. Then, using a 9/16\" wrench, place and secure the 3/8\" hex nut that mounts the idler bracket assembly to the deck assembly. NOTE: Another wrench of the same size may be required to hold the mounting bolt-head as the assembly is being tightened down. Attach the replacement idler spring to the idler bracket assembly by inserting the spring up through the bottom of the bracket (see image). Then, aligning the bracket assembly with its mounting hole in the deck assembly insert the 3/8\" x 1\" hex bolt up through the bottom. This is followed by removing the 3/8\" flat washer, the shield spacer, and finally the 3/8\" x 1\" hex bolt. Begin re-installation. To begin re-installation of the idler assembly, flip the shield spacer with its wide-face down and align it over the 3/8\" mounting hole in the deck. (Optional) Seat the idler assembly. Lubricate the seat of the shield spacer with a small amount of general-purpose grease and then seat the idler assembly down onto the spacer. (Optional) Complete idler installation. Re-insert the 3/8\" x 1\" hex bolt from the underside of the deck assembly up through the idler bracket assembly. Replace the 3/8\" flat washer followed by the 3/8\" hex nut and tighten using the 9/16\" wrench. An additional 9/16\" wrench may be required to secure the bolt-head while tightening down the hex nut. (Optional) Seat the idler assembly. Lubricate the seat of the shield spacer with a small amount of general-purpose grease and then seat the idler assembly down onto the spacer. (Optional)",
