      "description":"These are used on hanging curtains and draperies, usually to hold them to a side of the window, but can also tie a panel in the middle of an expanse of glass. Some tiebacks are attached to a hook on the wall behind the curtain; others are simply tied around the curtain. Like the hold back, a tieback can be invisible when not in use. Hold backs are U-shaped pieces of metal that anchor to your wall. The open top of the \u201cU\u201d faces away from the drapery, which can then be nestled into the body of the U. When not in use the hold back is hidden behind the curtain."

A valance can be made of the same fabric as your window covering, or you can choose a coordinating color. How about a contrasting color to liven things up?"
