  "text":" Repeating Lines in a Single Stroke Have a clear idea of what you wish to draw in mind and focus on a single, significant line. If you are copying the image from another work, you may want to have the original piece at hand. It does not matter whether or not the line is straight, curved, etc. Simply by estimation, imagine a \"Point A\" and a \"Point B\" of the line. This does not have to be perfect. Do not stress over the accuracy in location. Draw from \"Point A\" to \"Point B\" back and forth repeatedly. Always draw softly the first time. There will always be an opportunity at the end to go over your drawing in a darker color. There is no need to erase the mess around the straightest of the lines. It will only make the line look awkward and broken. It is okay if your lines make random turns or are rough. They are only guides for when you will draw over them with a darker color. Repeat with the rest of the lines.  Trace over every line slowly with darker color from a pen. Simply follow the most centered line that appears best. Erase the pencil. Your lines will most likely be quite close. In this case, allow your pen to take the path that seems the most correct. The penciled lines are most commonly used to keep from going off the path. Add color.  Drawing Multiple, Short Lines Once again, have an idea of what you will be drawing and focus on one piece. Imagine \"Point A\" and \"Point B\". Using brief, quick strokes, draw a series of centimeter-long lines connected to each other. Short lines are only a constant. You may wish to include a few longer lines, especially if the distance from \"Point A\" to \"Point B\" is significantly larger. Repeat with the rest of the lines.  Since this method is much neater, you do not necessarily have to trace over the lines with pen. However, you may want to because of the forked appearance surrounding the ends of two short lines. If you do trace over with another writing utensil, erase the lines to make the drawing appear even neater. Add color.  Creating Your Own Style Briefly attempt some of these methods.  Think to yourself. Which one seems easier? Do you think you could improve it? How? Try some of these new methods you have thought of. Remember that all artists have different techniques and styles. There is no conventional way to draw.",
