It\u2019s easy to get stuck in a rut of only eating a handful of meals over and over.

Input different ingredients, and browse until you find a good-looking recipe that you\u2019ve never tried before. If you often cook pasta and other Italian dishes, try searching for a recipe that includes no pasta and no meat. You could discover, for example, a vegetarian tofu salad that you enjoy."

Unless you\u2019re prepared to travel for a delicious meal, you and your group can decide together to stick to a nearby eatery.
