Sifting does NOT do this well, even after sifting multiple times!

No frosting where it shouldn't be; you have a good clean plate. Put a thin coating of frosting on cakes called a \"crumb coat\", then put on the normal frosting. This keeps crumbs out of the decorative \"topcoat\". This works well when using light frosting on a dark cake. Clean the edges of the cake plate with a damp cloth. Just pick up any crumbs and wipe off any frosting smudges."
