Night 3 Get through Funtime Auditorium to reach Parts & Service. There, you will be provided with a flash beacon to help you. You will need to walk intermittently, and flash the beacon to avoid being attacked. Listen for footsteps going to either side, and walk the opposite way. Flashing the beacon too much or too little will result in a game over. Follow HandUnit's instructions at Parts & Services. It will guide you in how to remove Funtime Freddy's power module. You are in no danger here. Keep following the instructions. After doing this, you are instructed to remove Bon-Bon's power module via clicking his black button. He will gradually rise up from either of Freddy's shoulders, and disappear when looked at. It is best to keep Bon-Bon in the edge of the light beam as he rises up, then quickly move and click his button. Taking too long will result in his jumpscare. After doing this, there is no more danger, and you may complete the night. Return back through Funtime Auditorium. You no longer need to walk carefully, as Funtime Foxy will unavoidably jumpscare you and send you directly to Night 4. Night 4 Notice that you're in a springlock suit when the night starts. You will listen to Baby talk for a bit, and watch Ballora getting scooped. The real challenge of the night starts when Baby opens the faceplates on the suit. Watch for the faceplates to open. Once it does, set a three-minute timer to judge your proximity to the end of the night. The spring locks  will then begin unwinding, and the Minireenas will start climbing up the suit. Click and hold to wind springlocks, and shake left and right to get the Minireenas off the suit.

However, if only one Minireena is on the suit, and it's getting too far, shake anyway to avoid its jumpscare. Prepare for Minireenas to begin climbing in the front of the suit. Don't worry about these, as they won't kill you, but they will cause springlocks to unwind faster. After the three minutes is up, the night is over, and you may progress to Night 5. Night 5: Real Ending Look out for the passcode. Night 5 is not very challenging, compared to earlier nights. When you are told by Baby to enter the random passcode, enter the numbers quickly and correctly; otherwise you will be jumpscared. Follow Baby's directions when you are crossing Funtime Auditorium. Avoid flashing the beacon. You will then proceed to be \"scooped\" and the game will end. Night 5: Fake Ending Ignore Baby's instructions if you want to go for the fake ending. If you have completed the Baby \"death minigame\", you are now able to access the Private Room. When you reach Funtime Auditorium, completely ignore Baby's instructions and go forward and right until you reach the Private Room to face off against the hybrid animatronic, Ennard. Enter the Private Room. You will have a short amount of time to get used to the game's mechanics, before the challenge starts. During this time, avoid using the monitor or the doors, as this will waste your extremely limited power supply. Listen out for scraping metal. The real challenge begins once this sound is first heard. This will happen reasonably close to 1 AM. Listen carefully to where the sound is coming from. It will either be in the left, right, or center, signifying that he is on that side of the cameras. Listen to the side on which the audio cue is heard. Close the corresponding door, and check the camera, on that side, closest to the room. If Ennard isn't there, close the monitor and open the door. If it is there, but not right up close, open the door and close it when you next hear movement, then double check to see that he's there. If Ennard is right up close, or right at the door, keep it closed until you hear movement, therefore it has moved away. Keep an ear out for more rapid sounds. At one point around 4-5 AM, it is likely that audio cues can be heard rapidly, going from side to side. While this happens, Ennard is not immediately ready to attack, but he will likely end up right at the door when he stops moving. Watch the power. It is advised to use no more than 16-17% of power per hour. Unlike the first game, running out of power will result in an almost immediate death, as there is no stalling. If you find you've used more than the recommended power limit, it's best to restart the night.",
