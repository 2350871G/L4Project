  "text":" Start with a square sheet of paper.  Fold the sheet in half, into a rectangle. Be sure to crisply crease your folds. Unfold, and fold in half the other way.  Unfold your rectangle. Turn the paper over and fold in half into a triangle. You should see the back of your paper. You should see the diagonal creases create \"valleys\" and the perpendicular creases create \"mountains\". Align the square by bringing the corners together. Allow the valley creases to come together in the middle. By flattening two opposite sides, you should find yourself with a square that is open on the bottom. Make sure your square is rotated so that the opening is on the bottom, as shown in the video. Bring the right corner of the top flap to the middle crease, so that the lower right edge lines up with the crease. Then, repeat this action on the left, so that the top looks like a kite. Fold down the top corner to make the crease lie along the horizontal line created in the previous two steps.  Unfold. In doing so, you return to having a square with an opening facing down. Take the bottom corner of the square and start to fold it up along the horizontal crease you made in the previous two steps. Bring the outer edges to the middle and flatten, so that you have a diamond. As you fold, notice the four diagonal creases on the inside that you made earlier. You will need to reverse the two creases on the upper flap. To reverse a crease, fold it in the opposite direction that it naturally folds. Turn your paper over, and repeat the previous five steps.
