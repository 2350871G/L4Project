It helps to draw it on paper and match the decorative elements to the drawing, checking that you have enough pieces to complete the design. This will make it easy to follow when putting the jar together. A simple but very effective design is to arrange a gemstone at even intervals around the center of the jar. Then, use a marker suitable for writing on glass to create a border around the gemstones. This is the design that will be used to explain the process for the remainder of the article. If using for a wedding, party or other special occasion, try matching the colors to the theme of the event."
