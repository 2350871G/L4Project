After that, discard or freeze them; store frozen mushrooms for 8 to 12 months. Be sure to refrigerate all leftovers within 2 hours to prevent mold and bacterial growth. Cooked leftovers should be reheated to a temperature of 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C) to prevent foodborne illness. Keep in mind 3 to 4 days concerns food safety, not quality. Cooked broccoli and asparagus, for instance, can become soggy and wilted within 1 to 2 days. The mushrooms in your stir-fry should be fine in 3 or 4 days, but the veggies might be pretty mushy by then."
