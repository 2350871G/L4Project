If you have any leftovers, put them into an airtight container, and store them in a cool, dry place. Making Slow-Cooker Cinnamon Almonds Coat the inside of your slow cooker with non-stick cooking spray. This will prevent the almonds from sticking to the inside of your cooker. Make sure that that cooker is on a heat-safe surface. Mix together the white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Pour both sugars into a medium-sized mixing bowl, then add the cinnamon and salt. Stir everything together until combined, then set the bowl aside. Beat the egg white and the vanilla extract together in a separate bowl until the egg white turns white and frothy. Separate an egg white from the yolk by passing the yolk between the two shell halves. Put the egg white into a separate mixing bowl, then add the vanilla extract. Beat the two together until the egg white turns white and frothy. Save the egg yolk for another recipe. Add the almonds into the egg white mixture, and toss them to coat. Keep tossing the almonds until they are evenly coated. The egg white mixture will help the sugar mixture stick to the almonds. Add the sugar mixture to the almonds, and toss to coat. Once again, keep tossing the almonds until they are all coated with the sugar mixture. Transfer the almonds to the slow cooker, and cook on high for 2 hours. Every 20 minutes, open the slow cooker and give the almonds a stir. Pour \u00bc cup (60 milliliters) of water into the slower cooker and stir to break up any clumps. The water will allow the sugar to caramelize and help give the almonds that crunchy, candied coating. Cook the almonds on low for 1 more hour, stirring them every 20 minutes. During this time, you can cover a baking sheet with parchment paper. You won't be baking these, but you will need something to dry them out on! Transfer the almonds to the baking sheet, separate any clumps, then allow them to harden. Be careful when handling the almonds, as they will be very hot. It might be a good idea to use a spoon or spatula to break them apart. Let the almonds cool, then serve them.
