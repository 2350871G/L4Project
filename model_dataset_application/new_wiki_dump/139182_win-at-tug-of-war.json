Make sure they're strong enough to continually pull the team back while maintaining a tight grip on the rope. In general, the anchor normally wraps the rope around their back and keeps the team moving backward. Normally, the anchor will set the pace for the tugging by taking a step back every 3-4 seconds. If the rest of the team can't keep up, it's up to the anchor to keep their grip and slow down so the rest of the team can reposition themselves.Tip: Try putting your heaviest teammate at the back of the rope as the anchor. They can help pull the rest of the team backward when they lean back."

This works well for some people, but you can still win without it!Warning: Avoid wrapping the rope around your hands to grip it.

When the game starts, carefully lift and plant your left heel about 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) behind where it began. Then, repeat this with the right heel to slowly move backward, moving the other team. If you can, try taking larger steps as the opposing team begins to get tired. You shouldn't be pulling or tugging on the rope. Instead, just hold it tightly and keep it close to your body as you move back. You can talk to the player in front of you and listen to the player behind you throughout the game. However, avoid saying things like \u201cpull\u201d or \u201cmove back\u201d during the game, as the other team might hear you and have time to get into a better position."

Shuffle your feet back 1 inch (2.5 cm) at a time as you push yourself backward. If you can't pull back, just try to stay in place until the other team gets too tired to keep pulling. Then, it might be easier to start moving again."
