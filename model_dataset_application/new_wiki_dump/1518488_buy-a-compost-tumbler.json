          "description":"For individuals or households with 2-3 people, a barrel with a capacity of 30\u201340 gallons (110\u2013150 L) should be sufficient to compost your daily kitchen and household throw outs. These \u201cback porch\u201d models are small, unobtrusive and a good option if you accumulate less than 2 trash bags of compostable material per month. Smaller models are also helpful if you have shoulder, back, or strength issues, as they are much easier to turn than larger tumblers, especially when full. If you also have some occasional grass clippings (from mowing a small lawn) or plant trimmings, this smaller model may still be a sufficient size; however, if you have any deciduous trees in your yard, it likely will not be large enough to accommodate the fallen leaves."

          "description":"If you generate 2-3 trash bags of material per month, you\u2019ll want to purchase a medium-sized tumbler. These models can be great for 3-4 person households with average food waste in addition to a moderately sized yard. If your gardening activities involve mowing the grass, trimming a couple garden plots, and raking up leaves from 1-2 smaller trees, a medium-sized tumbler should probably be sufficient."

          "description":"Larger models are a great option if you have a large lawn, many deciduous trees, frequently trimmed hedges, and/or a vegetable garden. They may also be helpful for households with more than 4 people, especially if you consume a lot of fruits and vegetables. Larger composters need to be turned more frequently than smaller models in order to ensure proper oxygen supply to feed decomposition. Try turning these larger models 1-2 times per day to begin. If your yard has several large deciduous trees, you\u2019ll probably get more leaves than any single tumbler can hold, even if it\u2019s a particularly large one. Consider purchasing a second tumbler or coordinating with neighbors who compost."

          "description":"The most common type of compost tumbler features a plastic barrel mounted horizontally. The barrel typically has an access hatch on the side that allows you to add and remove materials. Some are held higher off the ground by wooden or metal legs with a center post running through the length of the barrel. Others sit closer to the ground, resting on a specialized base that allows for turning. If you make a large amount of compost or have trouble crouching over, you may want to opt for a tumbler mounted on legs. These models allow you to roll a wheelbarrow directly under the drum and dump finished compost directly in. When purchasing a tumbler, inspect the supporting legs (if your model has them) and central axis connection by giving them shake. They should be strong and stable to hold up to heavy compost loads and years of use. The longest-lasting models will have a corrosion-resistant steel frame."

          "description":"Similar to horizontally-mounted options, vertically-mounted tumblers are also barrel-shaped. However, these barrels are mounted on a stand that holds them vertically, with a central axle running through the sides. Generally, these tumblers have hatches for adding and removing compost materials on either end of the barrel. Vertically-mounted tumblers tend to break up compost more easily since it tumbles end-over-end, dropping the materials from a greater height. Vertically-mounted tumblers can be harder to turn than horizontal options, especially when they\u2019re full. Before purchasing a vertically-mounted tumbler, be sure to check the legs and central axle by manually applying pressure and giving the frame a god shake. The frame should be stable and should not wobble or fall over in order to support heavy loads and frequent use."

If you have back, shoulder, or strength issues, you may want to look for horizontally-mounted models that feature a crank. This handle will make it easier to turn the barrel. Crank-operated models are nearly always situated higher off the ground, making them easier to empty as well. Simply roll a wheelbarrow under the drum and open the hatch to unload finished compost."

Once it\u2019s full, you\u2019ll need to stop adding materials and allow 4-8 weeks for the compost to break down. A dual-chambered tumbler contains 2 interior spaces, which means that you can continue to fill one chamber while the other breaks down your waste. This way, you can use your composter continually, without pausing between batches. Generally, the 2 chambers of these tumblers have less capacity than a large, single-chambered model, meaning you\u2019ll get multiple smaller batches of compost more frequently."

Since you can roll the composter directly to your garden bed, it can be easier to fill than other models and doesn\u2019t require the use of a wheelbarrow. To tumble your compost, simply roll the sphere around your yard. Most spherical tumblers are sold with specially made stands to keep them from rolling around when not in use."
