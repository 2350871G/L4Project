          "description":"The ring of lights around your Power button can indicate what kind of problem you are experiencing. This can help determine how to go about fixing it:\nGreen lights - The system is operating normally. One red light - This indicates a general hardware failure, and is usually accompanied by a code on your TV screen (e.g. \"E74\"). See the next sections for some tips on getting this fixed. Two red lights - This indicates that the console is currently overheating. Turn the Xbox 360 off for a couple of hours and make sure that it is ventilated on all sides. Three red lights - This is the Red Ring of Death, and indicates a major hardware failure. This usually occurs because the motherboard has overheated and become warped, causing the chips to lose contact. You'll need to either open up your system and repair it yourself or send it in for professional repair. Four red lights - This indicates a faulty or unsupported A/V cable."
