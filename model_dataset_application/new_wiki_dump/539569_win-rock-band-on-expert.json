Other instruments, however, can only be mastered if you have good timing tapped deep into your soul. Although they are harder, they're usually more fun. Choose either the microphone, the drums, the guitar or the bass before continuing."

Try to get at least 95% on each song. Make sure that you don't slack though, the next difficulty will be too hard if you do. Just play through each song on your chosen instrument until you've got it.

This may take a little bit longer than the last step but every minute you play will ready you for the higher difficulties. Practice mode can be a huge help here as you can slow down the song to play it at a comfortable speed. You probably won't need to practice if you're just singing though."

Because you're still trying to get 95% or more on each song, this step may take quite some time. It's best to try a song until you get 95% or more rather than completing the game and coming back to it later.

If you mastered the other three difficulties, you should know what to expect. You should also be taking it quite well. You may have noticed that you can complete songs that you couldn't complete before. This is because you practiced skills like speed, precision, patience and timing.
