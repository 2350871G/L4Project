Boiling water kills off harmful bacteria and other microscopic organisms that may be looking to cause you to have illness. Alternatively, water purification tablets or filters can be used to remove pathogens. In order to cleanse stagnant and sludgy water, chemical purifiers or a solar still should be used to remove solid pathogens. Some water should not be considered fit for drinking under any circumstances. Examples of this water include swamp water or water that has deceased animals in or around it."
