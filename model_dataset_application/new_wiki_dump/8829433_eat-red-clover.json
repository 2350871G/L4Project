Red clover flour is very popular for desserts, due to its sweet aftertaste. Like other flowering plants, the process is somewhat simple. Place the flowers on an elevated rack and place them in a cool and dry location for several days. If you want them dry quicker, you can place them in a dehydrator. They are dry when they are crisp and crumble to the touch. Ground the flowers with a mortar and pestle or similar device. Make sure that you turn the flowers into a very fine powder. Once you have a fine powder, incorporate the flour into an existing recipe of your choice. Feel free to substitute an equivalent amount of red clover flour for all-purpose flower."
