  "text":" Paper Room Divider Prepare the work-space first. Lay down clean sheets or similar to protect the work surface and to provide a nice area to work on. Form three frames that create the divider. To do this, start with the first frame. Saw the corners of the wood pieces at a 45 degree angle. This is necessary to allow the wood pieces to fit together snugly. Lay the first frame out on the floor, on your work-space. Place a short piece (one of the pieces measuring 4 x 4 x 75cm (1 /12\" x 1 1/2\" x 29 1/2\")) on the work surface. Then place a long piece on each side of this. Finish by placing the other short piece at the base. This forms a large rectangle, namely the frame. Join the four pieces of wood together. Using the glue suitable for wood, glue the angled corners together, to attach each piece of wood permanently to form the frame. Push the join together for a bit using your hands or a clamp, to help ensure a tight affixing and to ensure that the glue works as it should. Allow to fully dry. Strengthen the joint areas. Where the angled parts have been glued together, use the L-shaped plates. Screw these onto the reverse side of the corner joins. Don't worry, these will get painted over along with the wood. Repeat to make the remaining two frames.  Set up the paint and painting equipment. Put down a painting drop-cloth to protect the work surface. Paint the frames on all sides. You can rest the frames on upturned yogurt pots or ice cream containers, or just wait for each wider side to dry before turning the frame over and doing the other side. Repeat two to three times. The paintwork should appear smooth, glossy and well coated. Keep in mind how it'll look in your home. Allow to dry between each layer added. Read the instructions accompanying the paint to help you to determine the right amount of layers. If it doesn't clarify this, try two, then go for three layers if you're not satisfied with two. Attach the hinges to the sides of what will be the center frame. Place three hinges on each side, placing the top one approximately 30xm (12\") from the top and the base one 30xm (12\") from the base of the center frame. The center hinge goes in the middle between these two hinges. Attach the frames together to form the divider. Attach the two side frames to the center frames at the hinges. Place the divider down on the floor, completely folded out flat. Have it facing reverse-side upward, as this is the side that you'll be attaching the paper pieces to. Place the paper sheets over each frame. There needs to be an overlay section toward the middle of each frame, as the paper won't cover the whole frame length. Adjust to ensure that the paper is covering each frame sufficiently. Trim the paper to fit the frames neatly. Ensure that there is sufficient paper to glue onto the wood frame part, to hold it in place. All trimming must be very straight and neat, so use a ruler if needed and/or get a helper with this stage. Attach the paper. Paint glue around the wood parts and gently stretch the paper over the glue. Also gently hammer in some panel pins in each corner and center of each length the paper is attached to. Be careful when stretching the paper, to avoid tearing it. Allow to dry completely.  Screw the corner covers onto each corner joint of the frames. This covers the joints and neatens the whole project. Stand the divider up. Check that it opens and closes with ease. You may need to make adjustments if it's getting stuck. Take to the room where it will be used. Set it up and enjoy your new paper room divider. Foam Room Divider Cut each 20x30 foam board into four (4) equal sized pieces with an Exacto knife. Each piece should be 10x15 inches. Create slits. Make slits in each 10x15 piece of foam that are 0.5 cm wide (the approximate thickness of a foamcore board). Make one slit in the center, 5 inches deep. The remaining four slits will be 2.5 inches deep. Arrange the foam pieces into an X shape. Do this by combining two pieces at the middle slit. Take breaks. Cutting for this project takes many hours. Round the sides of each piece. Use a large plate or something round to cut around. The end result will look much more modern and attractive. Stack the X shapes by interlocking them to create a wall. Make sure to go layer-by-layer from the ground up, since you cannot add more pieces once you establish the overall width of the divider, without completely rearranging the wall. If any pieces are left white, add Christmas or rope lights inside the vertical empty space. It will make it that much more impressive. To stabilize the wall from falling you can use something heavy inside or outside the wall to keep it from tipping over.",
