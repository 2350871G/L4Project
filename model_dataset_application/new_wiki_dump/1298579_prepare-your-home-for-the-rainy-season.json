Look for cracks along the ridge of your roof and where your shingles fold over to form the cap. Inspect the valleys of your roof (the area of your roof with a downward slope). Make sure that the sheet metal flashing does not have any holes or rusty spots. Make sure that you do not have any missing, loose or curled shingles. Replace any in that condition that you find as soon as possible so as to avoid moisture leaks inside your home that can weaken your wall and/or ceilings."
