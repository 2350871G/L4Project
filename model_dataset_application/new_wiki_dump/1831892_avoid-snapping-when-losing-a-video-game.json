Chances are, you got worked up over the course of back-to-back-to-back headshots right as your character spawned. Who wouldn\u2019t snap!? Watch out for signs that you\u2019re about to snap and try to chill before it happens. Before each new mission, level, or respawn, take a moment to gauge your heartrate. Gaming is fun, so your love muscle is probably pumping like mad. That said, if it\u2019s going a little too fast, and your cheeks are flushed, take a breather. If you start spewing words your grandmother wouldn\u2019t like, put your controller down immediately. You\u2019re nearing meltdown."

You don\u2019t have to give up on beating the game tonight \u2013 you totally still can. You\u2019re more likely to do so with your mood intact if you take quick breaks from time to time.

For instance, set that magazine you\u2019ve been meaning to read next to you. Even better, get your running shoes out or pump up your bike tires. When you feel your blood begin to boil, blow some steam by working out. You can always return to your game if you so desire. Working a healthy activity into your day may even help you execute in the virtual realm. Game for shorter periods of time. This may sound like a terrible idea, but it\u2019s an important step if you want to do a better job of keeping your cool. Your patience will begin to run thin during marathon gaming sessions.

Though you should work on controlling your temper regardless of environment, it\u2019s easier to do so when you\u2019re comfortable. If it feels like the furnace of Mordor or the ice plains of Hoth, adjust that thermostat. Keep an apple beside your console.

In order to avoid snapping, recognize that it is you and you alone that allows yourself to behave this way. You must accept this responsibility in order to start changing your behavior.

Next, ask yourself, \u201cDid that contribute anything positive to my day?\u201d  It\u2019s a loaded question \u2013 but be honest with yourself. By forcing your mind to acknowledge your behavior, you may be able to keep your emotions in check next time you lose in a video game. Adjust the wording of questions like this however you wish.
