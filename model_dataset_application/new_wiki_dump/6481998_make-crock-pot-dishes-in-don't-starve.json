Don\u2019t put in too many Monster Meat, Monster Jerky, or Durian in one recipe, since it would yield a Monster Lasagna, which actually damages instead of heals and also inflicts a large penalty on your sanity.

The only way to tell is by keeping an eye on your gauges, which you can do by hovering your mouse over the brain, the stomach or the heart icon in the PC, or by pressing R2 on the console. It might take a while, but you can calculate bonuses for each and every dish by first eating the completed meal, then eating individual units of your ingredients and taking note of how much health, hunger, and/or sanity they give you individually. Once you figure the individual benefits, you can then calculate the bonuses by adding the benefits of the individual recipes up, then subtracting the total sum from the benefits of the complete dish. Most of the time, you\u2019ll fumble and accidentally make a meal that\u2019s less filling than the individual dishes itself, but don\u2019t worry! Most Crock Pot dishes don\u2019t call for specific ingredients unless specified, so experimentation is the key! Twigs and Mushrooms (especially Red Cap Mushrooms most commonly found during the day) are the most efficient fillers, since Mushrooms are poisonous and actually carry penalties when consumed, but when used as an ingredient it will carry none of the risk for Monster Lasagna, and Twigs are completely inedible but can be used as an ingredient. Berries are also an acceptable filler, but only because it\u2019s one of the most readily available food in the world."
