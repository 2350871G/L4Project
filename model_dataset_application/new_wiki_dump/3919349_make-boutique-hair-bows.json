  "text":" Preparing Ribbons Cut a 22 to 28 inch (56 to 71 cm) length of non-wired grosgrain ribbon. Choose a 1.5-inch (3.8 cm) width for your first bow. Cut the end of the ribbon straight with a pair of fabric scissors. A 22-inch length will make approximately a 3.5-inch (9 cm) bow. A 28-inch length will make a 4-inch (10 cm) bow. Cut 2 lengths of 3/8-inch (1 cm) thick grosgrain ribbon. They should each be 4 inches (10 cm) long. Thread your needle with embroidery floss. This thicker form of thread will make a sturdier stitch. Double knot the floss at the end of a 6-inch (15 cm) length of thread. Plug in your hot glue gun. Keep the rest of the materials close at hand. Heat seal your ribbons. Take a lighter and hold the flame against the very edge of the ribbon where you cut it off the spool. Move the lighter along the edge so it will not fray. Twisting the Ribbon Fold your thick ribbon in half. Crease the folded middle with your fingers so that you can see it when you straighten the ribbon again. Lay the ribbon in a long line on your workspace. You should see the center crease in the middle. Place 1 finger on the crease to hold the ribbon on the table as you make your bow.  Start a butterfly fold. Place your index finger on one end of the ribbon. Slide it in a semi-circle until it is perpendicular to the center crease. Lift it and align it with the bottom edge of the center crease. Hold it on the center crease with your index finger. The ribbon should loop into an awareness bow, like the top of the breast cancer awareness symbol. Repeat on the opposite side. Bring the inside edge around on the opposite side and lay it flat on top of the other ribbon end. It should be facing the opposite direction. You will have a figure 8. Hold both ends to the center with your finger. Bring the center of the loop on one side of the figure 8 onto the center stack/crease. Bring the center of the other loop of the figure 8 into the center stack. This will give your center bow two more layers that you must hold in place. Pick up the bow, while holding the center in place to see if your loops are even. Flip the entire bow over while you hold it. The opposite side will be the front of your boutique bow. Sewing the Bow Pinch and fold the center of the bow 2 times. You want to make small accordion fold that will hold the center of the bow in place on your barrette. Pinch the center horizontally, gather the fold and repeat. These are extremely small folds. Pierce all three folds with your embroidery needle and floss. Make sure you insert the needle through all the material in your center section. Pull the thread through until the double knot catches at the end. Wrap the excess string around the center section twice. Tie the string off near the double knot. Your bow should now be secure and you won\u2019t have to hold it. Cut off the excess string. Fluff the bow out so that it looks like you want it to appear on your barrette.  Decorating the Bow Place the bow right side up. Grab a 4-inch (10 cm) section of thin grosgrain ribbon. You will wrap this ribbon around the center of the bow to hide your embroidery floss. Pour a dab of hot glue on the center point of your bow. Make sure it covers the embroidery floss. Press the thin ribbon onto the dab of glue. Be careful not to burn your fingers. Allow it to dry for 1 minute. Wrap each end of the thin ribbon around to the back of the bow. They should meet at the back. Snip off any excess with your fabric scissors. You only need the ribbons to connect in the back. Heat seal the ends of the thin ribbon with your lighter.  Place a dot of hot glue where the two ends will meet. Fold one end down and press it as hard as you can without burning yourself. Place another drop of hot glue on top of one end. Fold the opposite end on top of the first end and press it down. Assembling the Barrette Choose either an alligator clip or a clasp barrette. Find a metal clip that is smaller than your bow. Line the barrette if you choose. Cut a small section of thin ribbon, heat seal the ends and hot glue it securely to the top of the clip. Pour a thin strip of hot glue over the top of the clip. Press the underside of the bow onto the hot glue strip. Press down until you feel it is securely attached. Allow the bow to dry for 30 minutes before using it. ",
