This oil is a blend of virgin olive oil and refined olive oil (heat and/or chemicals are used to extract oil and flaws from the olive for a more commercial taste). This version of olive oil is an all-purpose cooking oil and is great for frying vegetables or meats. Use this oil to saut\u00e9 instead of EVOO to avoid a smoke filled kitchen. In comparison to EVOO, pure olive oil is lighter in color, more neutral in flavor, and has more oleic acid (3-4%). It is lower quality oil."
