Try rolling the lemon on a hard surface with some pressure before cutting it open. This will make the lemon easier to juice. Squeeze the juice out of a lemon and place in a spray bottle with water or use a towel to apply the lemon juice to the glass. Alternatively, you can use the lemon itself on the surface of the glass.

This has an added benefit as well: the oil tends to serve as a water repellant and may prevent future spot buildups. Place several drops of the oil in water, and use a sponge or a towel to apply the solution to the glass. Allow to soak, then scrub lightly with the towel or sponge.
