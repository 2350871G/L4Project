With an oral preventative, you don\u2019t have to worry about a drying period where the pesticide can transfer to children or other pets. Once the pet swallows the medication, you are finished. Some oral preventatives only kill the eggs or adult fleas, but not both. You may need an additional preventative if your oral tablet only focuses on one threat. Be aware that your pet may refuse to swallow the oral medication or may spit it out after you place it in their mouth. Even if you place it in their food, they may eat around it. Some brands of oral preventatives come in flavored chewable tablets, like beef flavored."

With collars, you have to make sure no one touches the collar, especially children, since it contains the chemical preventative. Collars may be less effective for fleas because fleas generally live close to the bottom of the body, around the rear area, instead of near the head where the collar will be. Collars may have a strong, unpleasant odor. They may also irritate your pet\u2019s neck or skin."

Sprays, powders, and shampoos work immediately to kill fleas, but they do not protect your pet from reinfestation and do not repel fleas. Powders generally last for about a week and shampoos last for a day. Sprays generally last for up to a month, but your pet cannot get wet. This includes swimming, baths, or rain. If you want ongoing protection from fleas, consider something stronger than these products."
