Instead, reach the gaff over the tuna\u2019s head and body, and point the hook back towards yourself to impale the fish. This will also benefit you by decreasing the chance that you\u2019ll cut the fishing line. If you reach in front of the fish\u2019s head and over the fishing line, you risk slicing the line with the sharp point of the gaff."

Gaffs do not have a barb at the tip of the hook, so you should be able to slide the gaff out of the fish\u2019s body with ease. Do not gaff a fish\u2014tuna or otherwise\u2014if you\u2019re not planning to bring it back to the dock. You cannot release a gaffed fish back to the ocean, as the gaff wound will prove fatal in nearly all cases."
