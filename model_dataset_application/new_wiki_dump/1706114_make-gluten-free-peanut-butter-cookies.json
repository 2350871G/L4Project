  "text":" Prepare the Dough While you preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180\u00b0C), line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. You will need to place baking weights or some other weights on the corner of the cookie sheet to keep the parchment paper from curling while you bake.

Since this recipe makes 3 dozen cookies, you will have to reuse the same cookie sheet three times unless you have more than one, and all of them fit comfortably in your oven. Combine the egg, sugar and baking soda in a mixing bowl until the ingredients are well-combined. Use either a stand mixer with a paddle attachment or a handheld mixer. Beat in the peanut butter and the vanilla extract. When all of the ingredients are well-combined, turn off the mixer. Make sure to turn off the mixer while the blades are still in the dough.
