          "description":"Rinse about 5 pounds (2.25 kg) of russet potatoes and then use a peeler to remove the skins. Then, place the potatoes on a cutting board and cut them into approximately one-inch (2.5 cm) chunks. The potato chunks do not need to be exactly one-inch in size. However, making them smaller will help the potatoes cook more evenly."

          "headline":"Cook the potatoes with water, butter, salt, and pepper.",
          "description":"In a large mixing bowl or 6-quart (5.5 L) slow cooker pot, add the potato chunks, 12 tablespoons (170 g) of butter, 1 tablespoon of salt (17 g), and a \u00bd tablespoon (8 g) of ground black pepper. Stir the mixture until the potato chunks are completely covered in salt and pepper. Add 1 cup of water (240 mL) and cook the mixture on high for 4 hours or on low for 7 to 8 hours. You can melt the butter before you add it to the potatoes. However, it will melt while they cook anyway. The potatoes may brown a little while they cook. However, this should not affect the flavor."

          "headline":"Mash the potatoes and stir in sour cream and milk.",
          "description":"Once the potatoes are soft, add 1 \u00bd cups (360 mL) of warm milk to the mixture. Then, take a potato masher or an electric mixer and smash the potatoes. If the potatoes are still too clumpy, add another \u00bd cup (120 mL) of warm milk to the potatoes and continue mashing. It may work best to use the masher to break down the potatoes and then use the mixer to whip them into a nice fluffy texture. Add salt and pepper to taste."

You can make gravy to accompany your potatoes or add toppings like sour cream, bacon, or chives. You could even use your slow cooker mashed potatoes to make a delicious shepherd\u2019s pie."
