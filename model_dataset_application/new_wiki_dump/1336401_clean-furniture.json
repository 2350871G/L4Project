Make an effort to clean the cracks and crevices of your furniture between cushions, like the areas where the arms of a sofa meet the back. Take the cushions off, too, and vacuum all sides of them. The fiber density of microfiber furniture makes them stain-resistant, and lets the majority of dirt and debris be easily brushed loose. Give it a brushing before you vacuum."

If you no longer have the tag, consult a professional. W means: Use water-based detergent. S means: Clean with a water-free product, like dry cleaning solvent. WS means: Either a water-based cleaner or a water-free cleaner is appropriate. X means: Professionally cleaning only, though feel free to vacuum it. Keep this is in mind when purchasing furniture."
