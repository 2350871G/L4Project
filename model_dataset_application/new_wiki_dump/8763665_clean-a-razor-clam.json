Before you get started, give your clam shells a nice scrub so that you won\u2019t transfer any sand onto your clam meat during the unshelling. You don\u2019t need to use any soap or cleaning product to wash off the sand. All you need is water and friction. Put your clams into a colander or steamer basket that fits into a pot.

Grab a few towels or oven mitts to help you safely handle your clams. If you don\u2019t have a pot that\u2019s large enough, then you can use a heat proof bowl. Boil a pot of water. Bring your water to a rolling boil. You can leave it in the pot for the next step, or you can pour it into your heat proof bowl if you\u2019re using one. While the amount of water doesn\u2019t have to be exact, it\u2019s best to use about 1 quart (1 liter) for every 15 clams. Dip the colander or steamer basket into the pot. Completely submerge your clams to get them to open their shells. While they\u2019re in the water, gently shift the colander back and forth to encourage the clams to open. Wait 10 seconds, then remove the clams. The clams will have opened their shells with the meat exposed, but you need to cool them down quickly so that the meat doesn\u2019t cook.

If the clam is not completely detached, cut its four abductor muscles with a sharp knife. Splitting the Clam Meat Remove the tip of the neck (the siphon). This is the tough part of the clam, so most people choose to slice it off. You will want to remove it as close to the tip as possible to preserve the meat. Cut a slit from the foot of the clam up to the tip of the neck. One side of the clam should have a sharp tooth-like texture that resembles a razor-blade or zipper.

Rinse the area until all you see is clean, white clam meat. Preparing Your Clams for Cooking Hold each clam under running water. Once you\u2019ve cut away all of the innards, you\u2019ll want to give your clams a final rinse. For best results, rinse them individually under your tap. Allow each clam a few seconds under the water. Place the clams into a clean dish. As you finish washing each clam, transfer it into your preparation dish. Continue until all of the clams are clean. Drain away any excess water. After you\u2019re done washing the clams, drain off any water that has accumulated in your dish. Cook or store your clams. Proceed with your recipe or freeze your clams for later. You can always prepare part of the batch and save the rest. If you want to freeze your clams, place them in a storage bag or container.
