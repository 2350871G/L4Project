  "text":" Storing Biltong in a Paper Bag Put the biltong in a brown paper bag and store it in a dry cool, place. The paper bag is better than a plastic one, because it will keep your biltong more dry. You can leave the bag out on the counter or in a cabinet. Use a clean, new paper bag, not one that's wet. Stir the biltong every day to ensure air flow. If your biltong is very wet, shuffle it several times a day. Stirring the biltong is a good excuse to snack on it too! Eat the biltong within a few days. If you leave it for longer, mold may grow on the meat. Keeping Biltong in a Jar or Bowl Clean and dry your receptacle and make sure the biltong is dry. Any excess moisture will speed up the meat\u2019s decay, so you can dry the biltong with a kitchen towel. Add the biltong to the container. Don\u2019t pack the biltong in too tightly. You want to leave room for air to circulate. Cover the top with a paper towel or piece of cloth. Don\u2019t use the lid of the jar or a sealed lid for the bowl, because you want air to be able to flow around the biltong and keep it dry. If you are using a jar, you can seal the paper towel around the top with a rubber band. Putting Biltong in the Fridge Keep vacuum-sealed biltong in the fridge to make it last longer. Check the best-by date to make sure you don\u2019t wait too long before starting to eat it. If you are going to wait to open the package for more than a week, put it in the freezer instead. Move the biltong to a paper bag or an open bowl once the package has been opened. Don\u2019t leave it in plastic packaging, or else it will go rancid much more quickly. You can also keep the biltong on an open plate in the fridge. Check that\u2019s it\u2019s still good before eating. It will last longer in the fridge than outside, but it will probably not last more than a week. Freezing Your Biltong Vacuum pack the biltong. Put the meat in a plastic bag and remove all the air. You can vacuum pack with an automatic machine or a manual pump. If you bought it from the store in a sealed package, it is probably already vacuum-sealed. Vacuum-packing and freezing may change the texture of the biltong, but it's the best way to keep it safe. Mark the bag with the date you sealed it and place it in the freezer. This will help you keep track of how long your meat has been in the freezer. It can last up to a year. Defrost a bag when you want to eat it. As you defrost it, keep mixing it and drying it with a kitchen towel to remove moisture. You can then use the other storage methods to store it for shorter periods of time.
