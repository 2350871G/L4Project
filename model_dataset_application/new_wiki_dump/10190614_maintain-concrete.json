Use protective footwear, hearing protection and gloves when cleaning your concrete with a pressure washer. Make sure you are familiar with the safety warnings of the pressure washer before using it. Hold the washer 2 feet (0.6 m) away from the surface at a 45-degree angle. Use a finer nozzle on the pressure washer to clean stains and small spots on your concrete. The higher the level of the nozzle the wider the spray, but be sure not to use a 0 -degree nozzle which can be dangerous due to its high pressure of water. Move the nozzle back and forth over the surface of your concrete covering the whole area, and focusing on the stained areas."

          "description":"Over time, cracks can appear in the concrete, it\u2019s best to fill them and seal the concrete to prevent water intrusion. Also, removing any large trees from the driveway can prevent the roots of the trees surfacing beneath the concrete and create an uneven-cracked surface. If you have a crack in your concrete, you can take a few steps to repair it:\nFirst, clean the surface of concrete you are going to repair, remove any grime and scrub away any dirt to have a clean surface to work with to ensure the filler will stick to the surface. Use a chisel to create an area for filling, this means making the base as wide as the surface of the crack. Remove any debris from the area with a broom or vacuum. Use the concrete mix to fill the hole and make sure you cover the whole cracked area. You can find a concrete mix at your local hardware store. Smooth off the repair and leave to dry, overnight if needed. Read the instruction manual to see how long it takes to set. Apply a sealer to your concrete, if it is in an area of a lot of traffic a few coats  may be needed."
