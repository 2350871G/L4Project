The breaker panel will look like a large, rectangular box mounted on the wall with thick wires heading into it. Breaker panels are often painted grey with a black latch on the lid. You can often find the breaker panel on the opposite side of the exterior wall that the power line runs into."

          "description":"Wipe your hands on your pants, shirt, or a towel to make sure they aren\u2019t wet at all. Breaker panels manage and distribute a great deal of electricity. Touching them with wet hands increases your chances of being shocked. You can wear rubber gloves to ensure there\u2019s no moisture on your hands, but it isn\u2019t considered necessary. Err on the side of caution and dry your hands if you think they are even slightly damp."

          "description":"If anything were to go wrong with the breaker panel, standing off to one side could prevent your body from taking the brunt of any sparks or electrical charge it releases. Most panels open from left to right, so standing to the left of the panel will often give you the best visibility with the lid open. While breakers are rather safe, small precautions like this could save your life if anything were to go wrong. You don\u2019t need to be far off to the side, just aligned so your body isn\u2019t directly in front of the panel."

          "description":"Never touch the breaker panel with two hands at once, or you could create a circuit with your body that allows current to pass through. Instead, reach out with just your dominant hand and release the latch on the breaker panel lid. Most panel latches can be released by pressing them up slightly and then pulling the lid out toward yourself. The lid is on hinges and will swing open."

If any of the switches are even slightly misaligned with the rest (moved slightly toward the center), then they are no longer allowing electricity to flow through them. A barely flipped switch and a completely flipped switch will both have the same effect on the flow of electricity through your house. Look closely at the switches and how they align with one another. There may be more than one that\u2019s been thrown."

The electrician that installed the breaker panel should have written which switches power different rooms or portions of the house. Read the diagram to find the portion of the house that has lost power and use that to find the switch associated with it. If there is no diagram, you will have to rely on finding the flipped switch visually."

If the breaker panel starts making any loud noises, you should also call an electrician. Never, under any circumstances, open a breaker panel up to try to diagnose issues yourself.
