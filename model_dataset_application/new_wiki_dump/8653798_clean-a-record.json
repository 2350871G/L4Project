You can find canned at big boxed stores near the electronics. It can help to blow off the record ahead of cleaning, anyway, so you don't scratch the record when you rub against the dust."

You should be able to stick your hand in it easily. How much you warm up depends on how many records you have to clean. Start with a cup. Distilled water is better because it doesn't have the minerals and other additions that your tap water has. It can remove much of the grime on your records."
