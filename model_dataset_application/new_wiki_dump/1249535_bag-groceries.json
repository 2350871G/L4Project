Many stores are discontinuing the use of disposable bags, and cities around the world are banning plastic bags to reduce the number in landfills. Polypropylene and polyethylene are forms of recyclable plastic that are cheap to produce, durable, can be made from recyclable materials, and are chemical resistant. Other reusable bags are made from hemp, jute, cotton, calico, and upcycled scraps of cloth. All of these are strong materials that will last a long time. Clean your reusable bags, because they can become contaminated with bacteria from meats and fruit. You can put them in the washing machine or rinse them in the sink."
