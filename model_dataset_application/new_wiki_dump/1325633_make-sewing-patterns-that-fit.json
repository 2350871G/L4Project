The system is also known as The Golden Rule pattern drafting system. Today the Lutterloh System is the most successful pattern making system for hobby seamstresses worldwide. You need only two measurements (bust and hip) to make your own made to measure clothing patterns. The system works for women's, men's and children's clothes. The most important tool is the special sizing scale which is attached to an ordinary centimeter measure-tape. On this sizing scale there are numbers from 50 to 140. These numbers represent the bust and hip measurements in centimeters.  The smallest number 50 is about 18 inches (45.7 cm) and the highest number 140 is about 55 inches (139.7 cm). A pin is inserted into the hole corresponding to the number of the bust measurement and then placed in the center of the cross of the pattern design. The scale is then guided around the pattern until it touches one of the lines with a number on it. This number stands for centimeters and means that a dot should be placed next to the tape measure at the respected number.
