Look for a small or medium-sized jicama with brown skin. It should be slightly shiny, rather than dull. Choose a root without any blemishes or soft spots. The smaller jicama are younger and sweeter. If you want a starchier taste, choose a larger jicama, though it might be a bit woody in texture. The jicama should be heavy for its size. If it feels light, it has probably been sitting there for a long time, and the moisture has started to evaporate. Jicama are not seasonal, so you should be able to find a good selection all year round."
