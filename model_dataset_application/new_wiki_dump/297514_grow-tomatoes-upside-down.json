          "description":"Use the end of a pencil or your finger to poke two shallow holes in the soil in the seed cell. Each hole will be for two or three tomato seeds. The holes should be about a quarter-inch (6 mm) deep. Planting two seeds will increase your chances of success, because there's always the possibility that one won\u2019t germinate."

          "headline":"Cover the seeds with a small amount of soil.",
          "description":"When there's two or three seeds in each hole, cover the holes with a quarter-inch (6 mm) of soil. Gently press down on the soil again with your fingers to pack it down and ensure the seed is in complete contact with the soil. However, do not overpack the soil. This will encourage germination. Smaller tomato varieties, such as cherry or grape, are better for upside-down growing. Tomatoes are categorized as indeterminate and determinate. Indeterminate tomatoes are better for upside-down planters because they're more flexible and won\u2019t produce all their fruit at once, which can weigh down the planter."

          "headline":"Add a few drops of water.",
          "description":"The goal is to moisten the new soil surrounding the seeds. You can use an eyedropper to apply a small amount of water, or wet your fingers and let a few drops of water drip off. Don\u2019t add too much water, as the soil was already pre-moistened before planting. Keep the soil moist, but not soggy, as the sprouts grow. When the top of the soil becomes dry, add more water."

Remove the weaker sprout by trimming it at the soil level. You can either clip it off with scissors, or pinch it off with your fingers. Removing the weaker sprout will ensure the healthier plant doesn\u2019t have to compete for nutrients and light."

The plant should be about 6 inches (15 cm) before you transplant it to the upside-down planter. This will ensure the plant and the root system are established enough to take root in the new location. Don\u2019t let the tomato grow any bigger, otherwise the roots may get damaged when it\u2019s transplanted."
