If you're looking for a traditional ice wine, select a wine from one of these two countries. Canadian and German wines primarily use Riesling grapes in their ice wines. Canadian wines do not age well and are best consumed when they are younger. German wines should be allowed to age a little longer."

          "description":"The United States is not a major producer of ice wines, but it does have several very successful vineyards. If you're buying ice wine from the US, look for wines manufactured in very cold regions, like Michigan or the Finger Lake region of New York. If you're an ice wine super-fan or if you're local to New York, visit the NY State Ice Wine Festival, which is held every February in Fairport, New York. Wineries across the region bring samples for vendors and new fans to sample and enjoy. There are also other festivals scattered across New York, as well as across the country. Try Googling Ice Wine festivals to find an option near you."

Australian ice wine is created using artificial freezing techniques, instead of natural freezing techniques. Tasters are unable to tell the difference between wines frozen artificially and wines frozen naturally, but if you're looking for a more traditional ice wine experience, avoid Australian ice wine."

Good affordable ice wines include the 2009 Equifera Riesling Ice Wine, which retails for $70 and the 2012 Inniskillin Riesling Ice Wine, which retails for $80. For even more affordable options, try the 2012 Reif Estate Vidal Ice Wine, at $50 a pop or the 2010 Megalomaniac Coldhearted Riesling Ice Wine for $30."

If you are looking to get slightly buzzed, choose an ice wine with a higher volume of alcohol. Most ice wines fall in the 8-9% alcohol content range."

To avoid inferior ice wines, select vintages from years that have been especially cold. 2013 was an especially good vintage for Canadian ice wines, so be on the lookout for ice wines from this year."

For an excellent sparkling ice wine, try the 2012 Inniskillin Sparkling Cabernet Franc ice wine or the 2014 Inniskillin Sparkling Vidal ice wine. If you're a fan of Rose, try the 2011 Sparkling Rose Ice Wine from Johnson Estate Winery. The best ice wines are generally found in Ontario's Niagara region, where sparkling ice wine was first produced."
