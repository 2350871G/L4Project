Equipment includes things like spare batteries, cameras, lenses and memory cards. Put everything in photo bags so it's ready to go in the morning. Other accessories include a flash, tripod, diffuser, and lights."

          "description":"Have a conversation with the couple getting married so you can get a better sense of the wedding location and what they are looking for. Talk to them about your thoughts on the best locations at the wedding venue to take photos and come up with backup plans. For instance, if the bride and groom want family photos taken outdoors but the weather turns out to be bad, plan a backup location indoors that the bride and groom would be happy with."

          "headline":"Survey the location of the wedding beforehand.",
          "description":"Going to the site of the wedding beforehand will give you insight into the best places to take photos. You can also test different camera angles and take note of how the light looks during different times of the day. Look for spaces that enhance the beauty of winter and make use of interesting architecture or beautiful, natural landscapes."

          "headline":"Dress warmly.",
          "description":"The winter can be cold, and you'll need steady hands to take good photos. Make sure that you dress appropriately for the weather. It's always good to overdress rather than underdress because you can remove garments of clothing if you get too hot. Remember to wear a hat, gloves, a scarf, and heavy winter jacket if it's going to be cold outside. Choose your outfit the night before to save time on the day of the wedding."

        {
          "headline":"Arrive at the wedding location early.",
          "description":"Sunlight is limited during the winter, so if you want to get group or portrait photos outside, it's important that you show up early. This will also allow you the additional time to unpack your gear and get prepared and set up for the day. Do one last survey of the wedding location so you can nail down any final details of the photo shoot."

          "headline":"Increase your exposure to +0.3 or +0.7 to combat underexposure.",
          "description":"Taking photographs outside when there's snow on the ground exposes your camera to extra light because it reflects off the whiteness of the snow. For this reason, it's likely that your camera will underexpose photos. Increasing the exposure can help combat this. In some cases, you won't have to change the exposure on your camera. It depends on how much light there is in the frame and what your subject is."

          "headline":"Don't delete images in the field.",
          "description":"If you're using a digital camera, it will be tempting to delete images when looking at the LCD screen. Because there's a lot of light and the screen has a low resolution and size, it's important that you save your evaluations for editing. Wait until you can look at the images on a computer under good lighting."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use artificial light when it gets dark.",
          "description":"During the winter, the days are shorter, and it gets dark outside sooner. To manage this, make sure that you bring artificial lights to take photos for when it gets dark outside. You can use a dedicated, through-the-lens (TTL) flash, spotlights, or clamp lights to achieve more light for your shoot. Using umbrellas and reflectors will help you control the level of light in your photos. Popular flashgun brands include Canon, Nikon, Pentax, Metz, Bower, and Vivitar. Popular professional lighting systems include Broncolor, ProFoto, Hensel and Lumedyne."

          "headline":"Keep your camera at a steady temperature.",
          "description":"When you are shooting photos in cold weather it's important that you gradually heat your camera. A sudden change in temperature could fog your lens or create condensation inside of the camera which could damage important electrical parts. Refrain from things like keeping your camera under your coat then quickly exposing it to the cold air. Store your camera in a car or on a porch to allow it to gradually adjust to the temperature outside. Keep an extra pair of camera batteries because cold drains them."

        {
          "headline":"Change the shutter speed and aperture when it's snowing.",
          "description":"If you use a tripod and set your camera to a longer shutter speed, falling snow will appear like streaks down your photo which can give it a powerful feeling. A shorter shutter speed will freeze the flakes in place which may make for a romantic and memorable photograph. Use a wide aperture if you want to vary how the snowflakes look. Test this with your camera before the wedding date to see which settings you want to use."

        {
          "headline":"Consider the photographs' winter composition.",
          "description":"When setting up a scene, use the winter weather to your advantage. Use the rule of thirds and do not center every picture if you want dynamic, interesting, and appealing wedding photos. Try to include the snowy background and beautiful scenery. Capturing snowflakes or snowy trees can also add to the whimsical feeling of your photography. Taking candid photos when people are not paying attention may help you capture genuine moments."
