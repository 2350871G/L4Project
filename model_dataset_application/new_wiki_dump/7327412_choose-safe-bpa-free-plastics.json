Older products are less likely to have identifying labeling as well. Many people are particularly concerned about BPA exposure in babies. BPA was banned in baby bottles and kids\u2019 sippy cups by the FDA in the U.S. in 2012, and earlier in Europe. If you have older plastic baby bottles, assume they have BPA and discard them. Scratches, general wear and tear, and repeated heat exposure cause the release of greater amounts of BPA from plastic products. This is another reason to consider discarding older, well-used products that may contain BPA."

As concerns over BPA and other chemicals in plastics has grown, so too has the market for food and beverage products made from these alternate containers, which do not leach potentially harmful materials. If even BPA-free baby bottles concern you, for instance, there are newer glass options that include a silicone sleeve on the outside to limit the chance of shattering. Be aware, however, that many metal cans used for foods and beverages (like beans and beer) contain a lining resin that contains BPA. Regular consumption of food from such containers does appear to at least temporarily increase blood BPA levels. Cans usually have no markings indicating the use (or absence) of BPA linings, but you can find lists of manufacturers that at least claim not to use BPA.
