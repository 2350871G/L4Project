Press into the spot with a screwdriver or sharp tool. If the wood feels soft, the mold has spread below the surface and into the wood. This will require more than surface cleaning.

Set a large fan (or two) in the room with the mold, and direct the blowing air towards the moldy floor or wall. Let the fans blow for several hours. Drying the moldy area will protect the floors and prevent future mold growth. Make sure your floors are totally dry. Ingrained mold needs to be dry before you remove it."

If the mold has penetrated deeply into the wooden floor, you\u2019ll need to use a more heavy-duty scraping tool. Use a metal utensil, such as a spackle blade, to scrape away the mold. Sand in a circular motion, and only sand the affected area. Once you\u2019ve removed the mold, polish the affected area with 200 or 250 grit sandpaper until smooth."
