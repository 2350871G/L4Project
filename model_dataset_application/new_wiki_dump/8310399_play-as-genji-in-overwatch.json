      "headline":"Master the throwing Shuriken: This plays a major role to his character.",
      "description":"Genji can throw two types of shurikens; each throw deals three shurikens. By pressing down on the left trigger/Left mouse, you can throw them in a straight line, accurately hitting other players. This should be used when one character is in front and getting closer to the defense or on low health (usually three straight hits can finish off a regular 200-250 health player). Press the right trigger/Right mouse for his second throw method. This time, when Genji throws the shurikens, they arc in a cone shape. It is good for lowering health of crowded players, or just attacking for normal use. This is very effective and faster than the first method (it throws out three per second)."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Deflect.",
      "description":"This is the best way to counter defense opponents (such as Bastion, Widowmaker, or even Tracer's ultimate). This is well-known for its powerful deflection, even deflecting many ultimates by different characters. This can be used in situations when you are on low health, or players are on low health and attacking you, or deflecting bullets for your healers or your team."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Swift Strike.",
      "description":"This is very effective for low health players. You can dash towards a character and finish them off quickly with your katana, or just escape from a bad situation and travel around the map faster."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Activate your Dragonblade.",
      "description":"Dragonblade combines Swift Strike with his blade Ryu-ichimonji, delivering instant killing blows. This is a very powerful ultimate when used correctly in the right situations. You can use this when your team is losing, or use it to kill players that are hard to kill in most situations. Press \"Y/Triangle/Q\" to activate the Dragonblade."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Double jump and wall climb.",
      "description":"The Shimada brothers both can wall climb; however, Genji can double jump, which means he can go to areas of the map where most heroes can't. Remember, you're the only hero that can double jump, and there is no cool down! So use it as much as you can, for example, while throwing shurikens or deflecting, it will make you a harder target to kill, or when Reinhardt is pushing you into a wall. This ability is very useful in flanking as well as swift strike."
