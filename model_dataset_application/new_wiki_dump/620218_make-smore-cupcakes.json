Press down to cover the bottom of the lining. Set them on the side. Beat the 1/2 cup of butter on high speed until soft or for about 30 seconds. Add in the brown sugar. Beat on medium-high until light and fluffy for about 3 minutes. Add eggs one at a time. Beat for 30 seconds after each. Set aside. Mix the graham cracker crumbs, flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.  Measure out the milk and vanilla in a separate bowl.  Add the flour and milk mixture to the butter and sugar mixture. Beat to combine. Fill cupcake cups with cake batter; about 2/3 to 3/4 full.  Place muffin tins on the middle rack of a preheated 350\u00baF/180\u00baC degree oven. Bake for 20 to 22 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through. Cupcakes are done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Careful not to let bottoms burn. Remove the cupcakes and let it cool down for 20 to 30 minutes.  Use a knife and cut a hole into the cupcakes. Fill each hole with chocolate fudge. You can put the top back on to prevent the marshmallow frosting from seeping in.
