Draw straight lines for the hands and legs, with circles for joints, and rectangles for the hands and feet. Make a taller body for the right head than for the left head, since this is the older sister/friend of the pair."

If you want your girls to be sisters or very close friends, you can actually give them more similar hair/facial expressions--it's all about the choices you make for your drawing."
