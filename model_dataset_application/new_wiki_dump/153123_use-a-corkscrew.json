You will see a long, metal spiral, called the \u201cworm\u201d and a flatter portion that serves as a lever when opening a bottle of wine. Depending on the model, your wine key may also have a short blade with you can use to cut through foil if a cork is covered in it. The spiral and lever parts will be folded into the wine key handle.

Remember to unscrew the cork from the worm, then fold your wine key closed and put it away when you are done. Using a Winged Corkscrew Lower the corkscrew\u2019s levers. This type of corkscrew will have two long levers (the \u201cwings\u201d) positioned on the sides of a center ring. Inside the ring there will be a long metal spiral (the \u201cworm\u201d), controlled by a tab at the top that can be twisted. Start by lowering the wings toward the center ring. The worm should rise simultaneously. Place the center ring over the cork. The center ring will be just a little wider than the opening of a standard wine bottle, so it should fit easily. The wings should stay down. If the opening of your wine bottle is covered in foil, remove this first. Turn the center tab clockwise. The sharp tip of the worm will pierce the cork. As you turn the tab, the worm will continue to wind its way into the cork. Keep turning gently until the wings are raised all the way up toward the tab. Fold the levers back down.

Using a Simple Corkscrew Open the corkscrew, if necessary. The simplest corkscrews are \u201ct\u201d shaped, just a spiral metal \u201cworm\u201d with a handle attached at the top.

The handles of some simple corkscrews will fold down against the worm. If yours is like this, just raise them upwards until the tool resembles a \u201ct\u201d shape. Slip the sheath into the handle if you are using a travel corkscrew. The plastic handle at the top of the worm should have a hole it it that is about the diameter of the handle. Slide the narrow end of the sheath into this hole, stopping when it no longer slides easily. The corkscrew should now be a \u201ct\u201d shape. Screw the worm into the cork.
