          "description":"Tactics refer to move sequences that are designed to achieve specific advantage and capture or defend pieces. Tactics are different than strategy in that the latter refers to longer-term piece development with an endgame in mind. Learn how to identify opportunities to utilize tactics and how to execute them. Forks, also known as double attacks, involve positioning a piece so that two different opposing pieces are under attack at once and unable to counter-attack your piece. Any piece can fork but the knight is particularly useful for forking because it is the only piece that can attack while wedged between horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lanes. Discovered attacks involve using one offensive piece to cover another. For example, if a queen has a diagonal line on a rook but is covered by your knight, you can move the knight out of the way and create an attack opportunity for your queen. Your opponent may not pay attention to a covered piece and thus put their key pieces at risk. Pinning involves placing one piece on a line of attack against the king with another opposing piece in the way. The opposing piece cannot move without exposing the king and must be sacrificed. For example, by placing a bishop diagonal to a king with a knight in the way, your opponent will be forced to sacrifice the knight."

          "headline":"Develop your knowledge of strategies.",
          "description":"Once you reach advanced-level play, you will need to start each match with a core strategy in mind. Core strategies concern general attempts to control portions of the board that will set you up for effective endgame tactics later on. You should also learn about more specific strategies like the Nimzo Defense and the Sicilian Defense which will provide more precise directions for how to move early on in the match. Even if you don\u2019t use these precise strategies, you should learn about them so you can recognize their use by your opponents. Spacing strategies refer to attempts to obtain the largest amount of board coverage to limit your opponents maneuvering options. Spacing is not about pushing individual pieces as far forward as possible but about slowly moving several offensive pieces into your opponent\u2019s territory advancing pawns for defense and support. A lot of core strategies focus on controlling the center. The center refers to the four spaces in the middle of the board (D4, E4, D5, and E5). Specifically, these strategies focus on moving pawns toward the center spaces with offensive pieces supporting them. If you find yourself in a defensive position, exchange pieces to open up more space. Exchanging refers to sacrificing and then trading pieces of equal value."

          "headline":"Execute endgame situations.",
          "description":"The endgame is the final stage of the match when there are very few pieces on the board. Endgame situations are distinct from the strategies you would use early on or in the middle because there is so much more space to move. A strong game-long strategy that gives you an advantage can be undone if you don\u2019t know how to protect yourself from clever endgame flanking maneuvers. Pawns become particularly important in the endgame stage as they can be promoted by reaching the backline. It\u2019s often advantageous to maintain stalemates with your offensive pieces until you can promote your pawns. While it\u2019s best to reserve your king near the backline during most of the game, as the board opens up, you\u2019ll want to move it closer toward the middle to give it more maneuverability to get out of checks and support other pieces. The king\u2019s ability to move in all 8 directions makes it much more valuable as an offensive piece as board opens up."
