You will need to acquire a refrigerator that is an appropriate size for the bar you have planned. You could also create space in a refrigerator you already own. Opened white wine bottles need to be kept cold to prevent flavor from altering. However, don\u2019t refrigerate red wine as this will alter the flavor. Most beers taste better cold, so keep beer chilled by storing it in the fridge. Some liqueurs should be refrigerated, but many are fine to store at room temperature. Champagne is nearly always kept chilled. Any older stock you have that is lower in alcohol content should be refrigerated to preserve flavor. Most highly alcoholic liquors do not require refrigeration."

Some liquors are used mainly in mixed drinks, so their flavor isn't as critical as other liquors that are enjoyed alone, without mixing. Lower cost can mean lower quality ingredients, different taste, and different distillation techniques than more expensive brands. Higher cost does not always entail a better taste!

When starting your bar, don't go overboard. Purchase only what you will actually use. Start out with ingredients for your favorite cocktails. You can always add more ingredients to your bar later on."
