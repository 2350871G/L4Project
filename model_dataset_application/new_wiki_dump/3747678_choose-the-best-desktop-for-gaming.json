      "description":"The processor in your desktop is going to have a significant impact on your computer's performance. If you're looking for a processor that has a lot of bang for the buck and won't completely empty your savings account keep your eye open for Intel's i7 six-core line. If you really want to pull out all of the stops you can take a step up and go with an AMD processor that touts as many as eight cores, but be aware that you're looking to spend quite a bit more if you take this route."

The top quality graphics cards on the market right now sit with AMD and Nvidia. For a mid-line graphics card you should be okay with 1 to 2GB such as a card from the AMD Radeon or Nvidia GeForce Gt series."

Mechanical keyboard are going to give you the best response rate and come with a really tactile feel that gives you assurance that you're hitting your mark. Noise cancelling headphones can also be a great thing to keep in mind to get the most out of all those water ripples, gun shot re-verbs and background ambiance."
