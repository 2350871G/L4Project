          "description":"Mead is the oldest alcoholic drink in the world, and is made from fermented honey and diluted water. It often has fruits, vegetables, grains, or spices added. You can either make your own mead at home, purchase it from a local meadery or liquor store, or go to a tasting session. Traditional mead is made just from honey, water, and yeast. Bochet mead is made by the honey being caramelized separately before the water is added. This mead has a rich marshmallow or toffee flavor! Melomel mead is made using fruit or fruit juices, and sometimes has spices added too. Metheglin mead is a mead made with lots of spices. These are usually ginger, orange peel, cinnamon, coriander, nutmeg, tea, or cloves."
