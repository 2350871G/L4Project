Making Bacon Stuffed Pancakes Separate the yolks from the whites. Beat the egg whites until they turn stiff, then set them aside. You will eventually be folding them into the batter. You can also make pancake batter from a mix instead. If you choose to make your pancake batter from a box instead, use less water and/or milk than required.

Beat together the yolks, sugar, and salt first until everything is smooth and consistent and not streaks remain. Stir in the baking powder until just combined.

Gently fold them in, scraping the bottom and sides of the bowl often. Keep folding until the color is consistent and no streaks remain. Let the batter rest for 15 to 30 minutes. During this time, you can start preparing the bacon. By the time the bacon is ready and cooled, the batter should be ready too. Fry the bacon in a griddle over medium-high heat. Wipe the excess grease from the pan when you are done. This way, you won't have to re-grease the pan for the pancakes. If you don't have a griddle, you can use a skillet instead. Keep in mind that you will have to make the pancakes in smaller batches later on. Set the bacon aside on some paper towels. This will help soak up the excess grease and make the bacon even crispier.
