Keep water simmering and reduce the temperature if the water starts to boil. Halve an onion, remove the skin then chop half of the onion into small cubes.  Add vegetable oil to a frying pan on a low heat and wait for the oil to sizzle. When you hear a sizzling noise, add the chopped onion to the frying pan. Wait for the onion to turn very slightly brown, then add to the saucepan. Lightly fry some minced beef in the frying pan which was used to fry the onions (leave the residue from the onions in pan). This is to add the flavour from the onion to the beef and to seal the meat. Add the beef mince and a cup of beef or lamb stock to the saucepan. Chop a very small amount of celery, and add to the saucepan to add a slightly different texture and flavour. (optional) Add 1 tsp tomato puree to the soup mixture.  Mince 1 clove of garlic and mix with the soup.  Chop the stalk end off of two red bird's eye chilis. Cut through the middle of each chilly and remove all seeds.
