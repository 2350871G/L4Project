If the cheese comes in a block, use a grater to make 2 cups of shredded cheese. You can substitute cheddar cheese with other cheeses such as Gouda, or Swiss cheese. To spice up the basic sauce, add salsa, hot sauce, beer, or wine for a little extra flavor."

This means that when it is added to cheese sauce, it reduces the cheese\u2019s acidity, makes the proteins in the cheese more soluble, and prevents it from separating. Instead, it helps to create a smooth, creamy texture to your cheese sauce. Look in speciality food stores and online for sodium citrate. It looks like salt and tastes salty and slightly sour. You will only need a very small amount of sodium citrate in the sauce for it to do it\u2019s job, so it is not upping the sodium level of your cheese sauce. If you can't find sodium citrate, you can use 2 teaspoons of citric acid (or sour salt) and 2.5 teaspoons of baking sodium as a substitute. Citric acid, or sour salt, can be found in the kosher section of most grocery stores. You should also use high-quality cheese for your fancy cheese sauce, such as Pepper Jack, Gouda, or Gruy\u00e8re. These cheeses will likely come in blocks. Use a grater to make 1 cup of your chosen fancy cheese."

While nothing really replicates the cheesy goodness of the perfect cheese sauce, a vegan cheese-style sauce may help you kick the craving. The key to making good vegan cheese sauce is using starchy vegetables like zucchini and potatoes to give the sauce a creamy texture and keep it from separating. You will need access to a high powered blender, food processor, or Vitamix to create a creamy texture for this sauce. Nutritional yeast can be found in health food stores in the form of flakes or powder. It has a strong, savory flavor that is nutty and tangy. The deactivated yeast is a popular vegan substitute for cheese in recipes. If you are allergic to soy sauce, you can substitute it for vegan worcestershire sauce, sold at most health food and speciality food stores. It will give the sauce a similar flavor, but you will need to add more salt to make up for the saltiness that soy sauce provides."
