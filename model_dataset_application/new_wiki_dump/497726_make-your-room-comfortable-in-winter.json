      "headline":"Change your duvet to a higher tog rating.",
      "description":"A good winter tog rating is usually 12 and upwards. For medium warmth, get a 9-11 one. If you sleep with someone else who doesn't feel the cold the way you do, look for a duvet with a warm and a cold side. These clever marriage savers, (well, argument avoiders any way) have a different tog on each side so one person can be warm and toasty and the other is pleasantly cool. An alternative to this is to have the bed made up with two single duvets of a tog that suits either person, in matching single duvets covers. To feel more like you are in bed together, put a double sheet under the duvets."

      "headline":"Change your other bedding.",
      "description":"Thin cotton isn't great for winter, try brushed cotton which is warmer, or try jersey knit. Cotton flannel is good for a winter comforter too. Choose warm rich colors like red, plum, maroon, and brown which will give a cozier feeling. White also looks good in winter. Buy some chunky knit blankets for extra warmth at night. Quilted throws, Micro-fleece blankets and faux-fur throws are all good to snuggling up with too."

      "headline":"Purchase an electric blanket for instant warmth.",
      "description":"Make hot water bottles at night, but only use them before you get into bed - never use a hot water bottle at the same time as using an electric blanket. Make sure you know how to operate your electric blanket safely. Ones with timers and dual controls for either side of the bed are strongly recommended. Switching it on 20 minutes before you go to bed so you hop into bed and it's all warm is lovely."

      "headline":"Open your window.",
      "description":"Even in winter rooms need airing, so open your window for 10-20 minutes each day. Don't leave it open for as long as is needed in summer, and don't forget to close it. If you don't want to open the window, get a fan and leave it circulating for a while."

Make sure the lights in your bedroom are adequate and if possible, adjustable so they don't make you feel too awake at bed too, or to drowsy in the morning. Remote control multi-colored, programmable LED light bulbs are available that you can set to come on when you wake up and fade off when you go to sleep.
