          "description":"Steamed edamame is a perfect vegetable appetizer to enjoy before any Japanese meal. The edamame will help fill your stomach a bit so that you don\u2019t overeat your main course. Additionally, edamame, or soybeans, are an excellent source of protein and virtually fat-free. You can ask your server for pickled vegetables if you don\u2019t want the edamame."

          "headline":"Try the miso soup or a seaweed salad.",
          "description":"Miso soup is prepared with a stock to which a variety of vegetables (and occasionally tofu) are added. Which vegetables are added depends on which region your chef\u2019s recipe is from and which recipe they\u2019re using. No two miso soups are alike. What is consistent, though, is that this is a virtually fat-free soup full of vitamins and antioxidants. Seaweed salad is also chock-full of minerals and vitamins, and like miso soup, takes the edge off your hunger in a healthy way. Seaweed is used throughout Japanese cuisine, from tofu to salad. Most Japanese restaurants will have other salad options as well, such as a traditional dinner salad or cucumber salad. If you\u2019re watching your sodium consumption, skip the miso soup, which can contain half the sodium that you need in one day."

          "description":"What constitutes a healthy meal to you may vary from what someone else views as healthy. You might feel that a low-carbohydrate diet equates to a healthy way of eating, whereas your friend might believe that low-fat diets or paleo diets are the way to go. Knowing how you define healthy eating is helpful when eating out, as this will inform your food selections. If you\u2019re on a low-carbohydrate diet or concerned about a low Glycemic Index number, skip rice with your meal and ask for extra vegetables instead. Japanese food is beautiful and delicious, but many of the sauces are prepared with sugar or large quantities of salt. Ask for sauce on the side so that you can regulate how much you consume. If you want to stick with low-fat options, avoid tempura foods and opt for grilled meats instead. If you\u2019d like a paleo or Whole30 meal, look to the sushi menu. Ask the sushi chef to prepare your meal without rice, or consider ordering sashimi instead. Also, make sure to bring your own bottle of coconut aminos with you to use instead of soy sauce."

          "description":"No matter what sort of cuisine you\u2019re eating, it\u2019s important to practice portion control. Japanese cuisine can be very healthy, but portion sizes are still a necessary consideration. The best way to practice portion control is to be mindful of every bite that you take. Chew it, savor it, experience it, consider it, and wait before taking that next bite. Eating this way will not only increase your enjoyment of your meal, it will help you hear your body when it signals that it\u2019s no longer hungry. Try to order so that half of your plate is made up of vegetables, a quarter of your plate is protein, and a quarter of your plate is of starch (starchy vegetables, rice, etc. )."

          "description":"Salad dressing in any restaurant is typically a less healthy choice, and Japanese restaurants are no exception. Your food may come with a dinner salad, or you might order salad as an appetizer. Either way, inquire about the dressing. If it\u2019s described as creamy or oily, ask for an alternative, such as vinegar, or skip the dressing altogether."

          "description":"Tempura is a method of cooking that is largely similar to deep-fried food. Tempura means that a meat, vegetable, or even cake is battered and then lightly fried. Tempura batter tends to be much lighter than other types of batters, like beer batter or traditional flour batter, but is still not the healthiest option. Instead of choosing anything prepared tempura, look for grilled or steamed options."

If you are opting for a low-fat diet, you\u2019ll want to stay away from katsu-style foods. Just like with tempura, ask your server if they have any grilled, broiled, or steamed versions of the food that you\u2019re interested in."

          "headline":"Limit your sodium.",
          "description":"You might be watching your sodium intake, and as you know, any restaurant is going to have an elevated sodium content. Because salt enhances the flavors in foods, you\u2019re likely to find it in just about everything that you order. Ask for your food to be steamed and for any sauce to be put on the side. This will ensure that you get the least amount of sodium possible in your meal. Also, use soy sauce sparingly or ask for a reduced sodium version of soy sauce."

If you\u2019re trying to watch your carbohydrate intake, though, white rice isn\u2019t a healthy option for you. Ask your server if they can swap your white rice for steamed brown rice, which is full of more nutrients compared to white rice \u2014 like fiber, B vitamins, and vitamins E and K.\nIf the restaurant doesn\u2019t offer brown rice, ask them to skip the rice altogether or ask if they\u2019ll substitute steamed vegetables in place of the white rice. You can also ask if the restaurant will swap brown for white rice in your sushi."

Fish that is prepared healthily, such as steamed or broiled, can be an excellent, healthy choice when eating out. If you\u2019re watching your fat intake, though, you\u2019ll do well to stay away from fattier fish. Examples of fattier fish are mackerel, eel, whitefish, salmon, and sardines. Examples of leaner fish are bass, cod, flounder, mahi mahi, and tuna. Some fatty fish, like salmon, are high in Omega-3 acids, which promote heart health."

You\u2019ll see the term rolls also, which isn\u2019t another name for sushi or sashimi. Instead, rolls are a combination of sashimi and sushi wrapped in dried seaweed.

Be careful, though, and eat your wasabi sparingly. A small amount packs a big punch. You might also be offered pickled ginger with your sushi, which is another excellent flavor enhancer that is chock-full of vitamins and minerals such as Manganese, Niacin, Potassium, Zinc, Pyridoxine, and Iron.

Fancier, more modern sushi, on the other hand, might have high-fat or high-calorie ingredients, such as duck, cream cheese, and even sugar. Classic sushi is usually rolled on the inside and typically contains one ingredient. Fancy, modern, or fusion sushi usually has multiple ingredients and the rice typically faces outward. Some classic sushi examples are tuna rolls, cucumber rolls, eel and cucumber rolls, and pickle rolls. Some fusion or fancy sushi examples are California rolls, spicy scallop rolls, tempura rolls, or crunchy tuna avocado rolls. If everyone at the table orders a different type of roll, you can all share and sample one of each kind. This is a great way to try a variety of rolls without over-indulging in any one type."
