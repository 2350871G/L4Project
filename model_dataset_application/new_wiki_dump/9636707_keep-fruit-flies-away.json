Fruit flies often get into your home by coming in on fruit that you buy. Wash any fruit that you\u2019ve purchased \u2013 especially fruit that will sit out in a fruit bowl like bananas \u2013 as soon as you bring it home. Store fruit in a new container.

An uncovered fruit bowl can be a breeding ground for fruit flies. Use a clear cake dome to cover the bowl. It lets you see what fruit is in the bowl, but prevents fruit flies from getting to your fruit and multiplying. Getting Rid of Fruit Flies Use unfiltered apple cider vinegar. You don\u2019t have to buy a brand-new bottle of apple cider vinegar if you already have a half-used bottle. Take the lid off the bottle, place plastic wrap over the opening, and secure it with a rubber band around the neck of the bottle.

You can find these odorless strips in most home improvement stores or online. Simply hang the strips from cabinets near where you notice the fruit flies.
