Serve the ingredients together on plates. Cooked chicken will last in the refrigerator up to four days. Harvesting and Using Wild Garlic Harvest wild garlic in spring. Wild garlic can be found throughout all of spring. However, in early spring, the flowers have not yet bloomed. Once the flowers bloom in the middle of spring, they start losing flavor. Wash the leaves in water before use. Cut off any parts of the plant you wish to use, including the flowers and seeds. The bulbs are usually too small to use and taking them means the plant won\u2019t grow back. Run the cuttings under cold water, then pat them dry with a cloth. Use wild garlic bulbs as a substitute for store-bought garlic. The bulbs serve the same function as standard garlic bulbs. Peel them and chop them up to use as seasoning in any dish that calls for garlic flavoring. Use the flowers as seasoning. The flowers and their seed pods can be eaten raw. Add them to savory dishes, such as salads, where they\u2019ll be an edible garnish. They will give you the same flavor as the garlic plant\u2019s leaves.",
