Put the frozen banana slices in a blender. Add 2 tablespoons (if wished, you can vary this amount based on how thick you want the ice cream) skim milk, soy milk, or any milk of your choice. (If you want a little more flavor, add peanut butter, or cocoa powder\u2013\u2013just remember you are adding on the calories.) Blend until it turns to ice-cream consistency. Serve immediately."
