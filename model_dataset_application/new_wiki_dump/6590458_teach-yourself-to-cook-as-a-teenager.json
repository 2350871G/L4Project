It can also be really helpful to have a food scale, but a lot of home cooks get by just fine without one! When using measuring cups and spoons, unless otherwise directed, keep the amount level with the rim of the vessel. For dry goods, you can use the flat edge of a butter knife to smooth over the top of the measuring cup. For wet (liquid) ingredients, use a liquid-specific measuring cup made of glass or plastic. Set it on the counter so the bottom is flat and carefully measure out how much you need."

When dicing something up, use the tip-fulcrum method: leave the tip of your knife in place on the cutting board and move your hand up and down as you dice and chop. Use an all-purpose kitchen knife for chopping, slicing, and pretty much anything else you might need to do in the kitchen. Use a paring knife to peel fruits and vegetables. Use a bread knife to slice breads. A bread knife is serrated, which means it\u2019ll cut through soft breads without crushing them.

If it\u2019s electric, you\u2019ll just turn the knob to the setting you need. You\u2019ll use the stovetop to heat things up, like boiling water or making soups, and to cook things in a skillet or pan. When recipes call for the burner to be set to \u201clow,\u201d \u201cmedium-low,\u201d \u201chigh,\u201d or other heat variations, they\u2019re referring to the different levels on the burner knobs, which control how high the flames go (or, how hot the burner gets if you are using an electric stove).

Check out all the buttons on your stove to find out how to preheat the oven, how to turn on the broiler, and how to use the kitchen timer. When baking or roasting something in the oven, you will need to preheat it first before putting your recipe inside. Most ovens will beep several times once they are preheated.
