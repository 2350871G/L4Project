          "description":"The wet zone is where the floor may get wet, such as by the tub or just outside the shower. The dry zone is where the floor will stay dry, such as by the door or the towel rack. Keep a good amount of space between the wet zone and the dry zone so you do not have to walk in wet spots when you use the bathroom. For example, you may have a wet zone where the toilet is next to the shower and the sink. Then, you may put the towel rack by the door to have a separate dry zone. Keep in mind you can use a bath mat to help control the water so it does not get in the dry zone."

          "description":"One popular option is to have a water closet that is next to the bathroom that contains the toilet. This makes the toilet more private and allows someone to use the shower while someone else uses the toilet. Go for this option if you have a busy household with lots of people using the same bathroom. Doing this can also allow you to have a larger shower or tub and a bigger sink in the bathroom, as you do not have to make room for a toilet. If you can\u2019t create a separate water closet, put a half wall next to the toilet to section it off and create more privacy."

          "description":"A bathtub with rounded sides looks more sleek and be more space conscious. A square shaped bathtub will take up more space but may fit your design aesthetic more. Keep in mind that you\u2019ll need to have hardware for a shower head as well as a shower curtain if you want to take showers as well as baths. Some bathtubs are freestanding and aren\u2019t meant to be used as showers."

Stand-up showers can be quite luxurious, and you can make them look sleek and modern by using spa-like tiles. They can also incorporate features that a shower/tub combo may not support."

          "headline":"Place the sink close to the toilet.",
          "description":"This will make it easier for someone using the bathroom to get up off the toilet and wash their hands. The sink should be a few feet in front of the toilet or adjacent to it against the wall. Do not put the sink above the toilet or too far away from the toilet, as this will make it very awkward to use."

          "headline":"Use dividing walls between the tub and the toilet.",
          "description":"If you have the room, keep the different areas in the bathroom separate with high dividing walls. Put a dividing wall between the bathtub and the toilet to keep them separate. Or use a stand-up shower with a dividing wall to keep it separate from the toilet. Using dividing walls that do not reach the ceiling can keep the room separate but still open. They may be a good option if you do not want the bathroom to feel crowded or too small."

If you include a small window in the shower, make sure it is frosted or can be obscured. Alternatively, you could install a skylight, which is a beautiful and functional choice. Plus, you won\u2019t have to worry about privacy.

Leave between 2\u20133 feet (0.61\u20130.91 m) of space between the door and any bathroom items, such as a sink or toilet.

Get glass doors that fit the shower properly and slide easily open and closed. A sliding glass door can be more expensive than a shower curtain, so you may opt for the curtain if you are budget-conscious. In some cases, you do not need to put up a full door on the shower. Instead, having a long pane of glass on the front of the shower, with space for you to get in and out, is enough. You could also choose a seamless glass door that swings open on hinges for a sleek look."

A trough style sink that floats is a good option for a narrow space. A rounded sink on a skinny pedestal is a good option for a space that is wide, rather than narrow.

Have a towel rack for your larger towels and a smaller rack for a hand towel. Position the towel racks at shoulder height so you can hang towels on them easily. Put the towel rack on the back of the bathroom door if you do not have space on the walls in the bathroom. There should also be a towel rack close to the shower or tub so you don\u2019t drip water on the floor. Some glass shower doors have hooks or rods to hang towels."
