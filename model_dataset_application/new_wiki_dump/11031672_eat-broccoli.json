          "description":"Broccoli contains a compound called sulforaphane, which has been shown to help prevent cancer and promotes detoxification in the body. Your body absorbs more sulforaphane from raw broccoli than from cooked broccoli because cooking it locks some of the compound in. Tip: If you're going to cook broccoli, steam it for about 4-5 minutes to cook it in a way that provides the most nutrients. Broccoli is also high in fiber, potassium, iron, vitamin C, vitamin K, vitamin B-6, and vitamin A. It contains more protein than other vegetables as well."
