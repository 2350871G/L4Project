          "description":"The basic paring knife grip uses 3 or 4 fingers on the knife handle and leaves your thumb free to rest on the item you\u2019re cutting. Bring your index finger just below the base of the blade and grab the knife at this point. Keep the sharp part of the blade pointed towards you. For added control, some chefs actually touch the blade with their index finger. Doing this without cutting yourself takes a lot of skill, so only try it if you\u2019re experienced. Don\u2019t squeeze tightly when gripping the knife. Use a firm grip but leave it loose enough so you can maneuver the knife. Grip the knife with your dominant hand for the most control."

          "description":"Grab the food with your non-dominant hand and press it against the blade. Keep the blade at a slight angle against the food so when you start cutting, the knife only takes off the skin. Rest the thumb from your knife hand on the food. This keeps the food stable while you cut it."

        {
          "headline":"Push the blade towards your body to peel the skin.",
          "description":"Plant your thumb firmly onto the food and apply gentle pressure with the blade. Once the blade breaks the skin, it\u2019s easy to work forward. Bring the knife towards your body, using your thumb to work it along. Stop and move your thumb back when the blade gets close to it, then cut more. Keep your fingers out of the blade\u2019s path. Hold the food by its sides so your fingers aren\u2019t in the way. Keep your thumb a safe distance from the blade and move it backwards before cutting more. Spin the food slightly with your non-dominant hand to work it against the blade. Work slowly in the beginning. It takes time to master this technique."

          "headline":"Work around the fruit or vegetable in rings.",
          "description":"When you get the knife moving, work around the item you're cutting until you reach the spot where you started cutting. Remove that layer of skin and then move to a different spot. Continue working down the fruit or vegetable until you've removed all the skin. If you can't make it all the way around the fruit or vegetable at first, that's okay. Just cut off smaller pieces. Skilled chefs can peel off all the skin without pulling the knife away. This takes a lot of practice, so don't worry if you can't do it right away."

        {
          "headline":"Readjust the knife if the blade takes off more than the skin.",
          "description":"Keep an eye on the knife and monitor how deep the cuts are. If the meat from the fruit or vegetable starts coming off, then you\u2019re cutting too deep. Take the blade off and readjust. Align it just below where the skin hits the meat so you only peel the skin. If you accidentally take off too much meat under the skin, you can cut away the additional meat later on so it doesn\u2019t go to waste. This technique also works if you don\u2019t want to remove all the skin from something. You might just want a lemon peel, for example."
