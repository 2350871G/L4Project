For example, to make a turtle, cut out 4 legs and a head from a piece of construction paper. Flip the paper plate over and decorate the back with glitter glue to make the turtle\u2019s shell. Glue the legs and head to the paper plate to finish your craft. Add eyes and a smile to the face with the marker if you want to.
