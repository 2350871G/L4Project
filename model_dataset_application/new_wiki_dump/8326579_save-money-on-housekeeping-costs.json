If you are running a hotel, you may encourage guests to reuse their towels to cut back on cleaning costs and water usage. Have a small sign in the hotel room that notes you are trying to encourage guests to be eco-friendly by asking them to reuse their towels for at least two nights. If you are a homeowner, you may try reusing your towels for a week and hanging them to dry so they are still clean enough to use throughout the week. You may then encourage others in your household to use the same towels for a week to cut down on costs and be more eco-friendly."

Provide a limited amount of paper items in each guest room so guests are less likely to use them up or throw them away. You can also reduce the amount of newspapers you throw away by offering them at the front desk rather than in each guest\u2019s room. You can also encourage guests to look at the news online. Always use reusable drinking cups that are made of glass instead of paper. Avoid providing items that are one use only, such as plastic shower cups or liners for an ice bucket."

Keep refillable shampoo and conditioner bottles in the bathroom. This will cut down on the amount of waste in your home or your hotel and ensure you do not need to keep buying new single use only items for guests.

You can also try to recycle any cardboard boxes that are no longer being used in your home as well as the packaging that items come in.
