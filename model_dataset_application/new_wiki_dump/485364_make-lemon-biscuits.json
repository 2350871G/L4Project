Lemon zest is easiest to make using a microplane or zester. Simply run the tool over the skin of a freshly-washed lemon. Try not to press so hard that you pick up the bitter white pith underneath the skin. The flavor lies in the yellow surface skin. If you don't have a microplane or zester, try a cheese grater or a sharp paring knife. Place the larger strips of lemon zest in a food processor to chop them into tiny shreds."
