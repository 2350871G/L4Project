Create a layout that incorporates the details of the project such as slope, headroom and exterior appearance.  Purchase your materials, including wood, windows and any other specialty items. Arrange for delivery of the materials as well as an industrial trash receptacle for the scraps. Acquire a heavy-duty tarp that is large enough to entirely cover the roof. Stretch the tarp out until it overlaps the roof ridge. Affix the tarp to the roof, screwing a 2 by 4 (5.08 by 10.16 cm) over it. Roll the tarp up so you will be prepared in the event of rain. Remove the shingles and the sheathing board from the area of the roof where the dormer will constructed.  Mark the inside edges of the dormer's sidewalls in chalk. Saw from the bottom up on both sides. Do not cut the overhang. Remove the sheathing boards.  Mark the layout of the dormer walls on the floor of the attic. and verify that the walls will be square with the home's exterior walls. Trace the layout on the underside of the roof using a plumb bob and install nails through the corners.  Remove the shingles from this area and mark cut lines between the nails.  Open the roof by sawing through these lines.  Indicate the cut lines on the old rafters using the layout you've drawn on the floor as a guide.  Reinforce the opening by adding rafters to both sides of the roof. Be sure to fasten the rafters in appropriately. Verify that the new rafters align with the sheathing of the roof.  Install a 2 by 6 (5.08 by 15.24 cm) header across the opening.  Frame the front wall to fit between the new rafters, assuring that its top is level and that the sides are perfectly plumb. Continuously verify that the walls are squared. Finish framing the walls by installing the side walls.  Frame the rafters. To establish the ridge point, stretch a string from the peaks of the new trusses, following that line back into the existing roof. Measure and cut a post to temporarily support the ridge.  Measure and cut the valley rafters, assuring that they have the proper angles for the slope.  Install the valley rafters using a straightedge to assure that they are properly aligned with the tops of the common rafters.  Cut the valley jack rafters so that the angles are equal to the common rafters and create a 45-degree bevel on the bottom.  Hang the valley jack rafters, nailing them every 24 inches (0.61 M) on center.  Use a 2 by 4 (5.08 by 10.16 cm) to temporarily support the 2 by 8 (5.08 by 20.32 cm) ridge board. Make sure you cut the length of the 2 by 4 (5.08 by 10.16 cm) equally to the ridge board's proper height. Create a header from a 2 by 8 (5.08 by 20.32 cm).  Cut it to the length of the opening and then use metal joist hangers to attach it to the new rafters.  Attach the rafters to the ridge by driving 16d nails through the ridge and into the rafters.  Hang the opposite rafter to the rafter using 8d nails and drive 3 nails into each side.  Attach the rafter to the wall plate, using 3 8d toenails.
