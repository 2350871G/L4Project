          "description":"Finding a daybed frame with a back will help make the piece feel more like a sofa during your waking hours. Having a daybed you can style as a sofa can be a great space-saver in places like studio apartments or small guest rooms. You can style a daybed like a sofa and still use it for sleeping if you want it to serve both purposes. The back simply provides some extra support for those moments when you\u2019re sitting on the bed, rather than lying down."

          "description":"If you\u2019re adding a daybed to your home as an accent or additional seating, consider a backless option. This opens up the piece to fit more people for when you\u2019re hosting parties or get-togethers. It can also be styled as a bench, chaise, or loveseat as you see fit. Daybeds with backs are designed to sit against walls, but a backless option gives you more options for potential placement. These are especially useful for breaking up different spaces in large rooms or open floor plans."

          "description":"A daybed with an additional trundle bed underneath can add even more sleeping area to a compact space. This is a great choice if you frequently host guests, but don\u2019t have a large guest room. A trundle bed is a second mattress on a low platform that pulls out from the base of your bed. When it\u2019s tucked away, it seamlessly blends into the larger daybed. If your daybed has drawers or a trundle space under the mattress, you can also use this to store additional blankets, pillows, and other bedding."

          "description":"Daybeds can give you a comfortable spot to lounge and relax outside. Pick one with a metal or sealed, weather-resistant wood frame to help it last through different kinds of weather conditions. You will also need a weather-resistant mattress or cushions. You may be able to find outdoor daybed mattresses online or from stores that specialize in outdoor furniture. Otherwise, you can use weather-resistant seating cushions meant for outdoor sofas and chairs."

          "headline":"Position your daybed in an area that compliments the flow of your room.",
          "description":"Where your daybed goes in your room depends partially on the daybed style, and partially on the room, itself. Daybeds with backs typically work better against walls, while those without backs work well as benches in the middle of larger rooms. If your daybed is going in a smaller room, it should sit against a wall so that you can keep pathways open across the space. Backless daybeds placed in corners or against windows can also make cozy reading nooks. If your daybed is functioning as the primary furniture piece in your room, it should be closer to the center."

        {
          "headline":"Choose large, thick backing cushions.",
          "description":"Adding some big, firm cushions to the back of your daybed will give it some much-needed comfort and support while you\u2019re sitting. Look for cushions that are about the same height as the back of the bed, and get enough to comfortably cover the whole back. Opt for firmer, sturdier cushions as your backing. Cushions that are too soft may lose shape sooner, and may not be enough to pad the hard back of the bed. You can always add additional throw pillows to soften them up if that\u2019s your preference. For a clean, modern look, try getting cushions that line up end-to-end to fit the back of your daybed. For a cozier or more eclectic vibe, overlap your backing cushions."

          "headline":"Use bolsters on backless daybeds for additional support.",
          "description":"Bolsters are long cylindrical-shaped pillows that fit well between the mattress and arms of a backless daybed. These offer additional lower back support for when you\u2019re sitting on the daybed, and can also make supportive neck pillows should you choose to lay down. Some daybeds may already have a single bolster attached. If that\u2019s the case, check with the manufacturer to see if you can order a second one for symmetry. You can also look for a cover for the existing bolster to help it match any additional bolster you get. Otherwise, choose one in a different fabric and color to compliment the scheme of your room. Don\u2019t try too hard to match the styles if you can\u2019t find something close. Intentionally mismatched generally looks better than close but not quite matching."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Add throw pillows to match the color palette of the room.",
          "description":"Throw pillows are your go-to resource for bringing some life to a sofa-style daybed. Look for pillows in colors that compliment the greater scheme of your room. Accent colors, those used for trim, and shades from other pieces of furniture all work well for throw pillows. If, for example, your walls are sage green, earth-toned pillows like those in rich browns or mustards, emerald and sapphire jewel tones, and creamy neutrals will all work. Experiment with the number of pillows to fit your style. Two larger pillows, one on either side of the daybed, will add a subtle and modest accent. But you could also have two pillows in two different colors on each side, or create a full line of pillows across the back fo the bed. If your daybed has a particularly hard back, additional throw pillows can also add some extra comfort."

          "headline":"Drape a throw over the daybed to add warmth.",
          "description":"Just like with a sofa, draping a throw over the side of your daybed will add some extra warmth and a welcome feel to your daybed. A lighter linen or cotton throw is nice for warmer months, while a microfiber or sherpa-style throw can make for a snuggly winter addition. Throws are another way to add some color to your daybed, too. Look for ones with color schemes or patterns that match your throw pillows or other accent colors in your room."

          "description":"The construction of daybeds can make it difficult to tuck in heavier bedding like comforters. Instead, look for bedding appropriately fitted to your daybed. Often, blankets for twin mattresses will work, or you can look for specialty daybed bedding. Find one with a color or pattern that matches the color scheme for the room. Then, simply drape the blankets so that they hang over the edge of your mattress. The blanket should be long enough to cover the length of your bed. It should be wide enough to overhang the sides of the mattress, but not so wide that it hangs down to the floor. Try folding down the top third of larger comforters and duvets. This can give a more structured look to the bed, making it look more like a traditional sleeping space. Lighter blankets and throws may be a better choice for nooks and areas where you plan on napping but not sleeping overnight."

Adding a few throw pillows is great, but try not to add too many. More than about 2 rows of pillows at the head of the daybed can make the space look small and cluttered.
