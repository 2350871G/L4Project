          "description":"Correctly identifying the ants roaming around your kitchen is an extremely important first step in rectifying your ant problem. That is because there are many different ant species that all have different habits and behaviors which can affect the treatment needed to get rid of them. Look at the ants in your kitchen and note their characteristics. Some characteristics to look for are their size and color. Ants in your kitchen are most likely either pharaoh ants or pavement ants, but it is possible they are a different species. Once you know some identifying characteristics about the ants, do some online research to correctly determine the species of ants in your kitchen, and some of the best methods recommended for eliminating that species."

That is because ants leave trails behind wherever they travel that other ants can smell, and follow. If you just mop or sweep your floor, that\u2019s not enough to eliminate the ant trail. The trail is a pheromone trail, it can\u2019t just be swept away; it needs to be cleared away with some disinfecting cleanser. Instead, mix \u00bd  vinegar and \u00bd water in a spray bottle, and cover all of your kitchen surfaces with the spray mixture. Make sure to target the areas where you have witnessed ants crawling around before. Keep in mind that this spray mixture will not kill the ants that are already in your house. This simply erases the trail from those ants, so new, outside ants can\u2019t follow their pheromone trail inside. You can also substitute bleach for vinegar for the spray solution.

Then spray the mixture on ants whenever you see them in your kitchen. Wait about 5 minutes to wipe up, because ants are a lot easier to clean off your counters once they stop moving. You can also use bar soap for your soap additive: Shave off a few ounces of the bar soap, and add it to about a litre of water. Then microwave the water and soap flakes to melt the soap, and add it to a spray bottle. This method is safe for children and pets since it doesn\u2019t contain insecticides, and can be used in your garden to repel bugs from your plants."

You want to make sure there isn\u2019t any food residue that could attract the ants during the nighttime. Consider pouring a little bit of bleach down the drain to wipe out the smell of left over food particles. EXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKevin Carrillo\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMMPC, Pest Control Specialist\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKevin Carrillo is a Pest Control Specialist and the Senior Project Manager for MMPC, a pest control service and certified Minority-owned Business Enterprise (MBE) based in the New York City area.

Most people always have a little residual moisture in the sink, which is just enough to provide a water source for ants. That's why it's important to keep everything bone dry. Sweep and mop your floor frequently. Ants only need a little crumb of food to begin calling in for backup, so be sure to clean up any bits and pieces of food that could be strewed on the floor and hidden underneath kitchen appliances. Sweep the floor to eliminate food sources for the ants. Mop your floor with a \u00bd bleach \u00bd water solution. Again, this mopping solution can also be a solution of \u00bd vinegar and \u00bd water. The only thing that matters is the sterile cleaning agent to eliminate ant trails. You can spray the mixture of vinegar and water around pet food bowls to prevent ants from gathering there.

MMPC's work has been featured in CNN, NPR, and ABC News. Kevin Carrillo\t\t\tMMPC, Pest Control Specialist\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: It's important to remove any food sources that you have out for the ants. Keep in mind that what might be a negligible food amount for you is still a week-long feast for an ant. Check the trap on your toaster and lift the range on your stove. If you can safely move your stove to make sure no food has fallen under it, you might wan tto do that as well. Vacuum spaces that come in contact with food. Just like sweeping and mopping, vacuuming helps clean up any bits of food that could attract ants to come into your house. This is especially important for homes with carpeting, as food bits are harder to see against carpet. Remove your trash regularly. Use sturdy, durable garbage bags, and remove your trash as often as you can to reduce the possibility of ants feeding on food near and in your garbage can. Often, a puncture hole in a garbage bag allows for juices to spill and therefore, can attract ants. Consider sprinkling baking soda at the bottom of your garbage can to freshen the can, and repel ants from the food smells.",
