          "description":"These are great to use on location when you know you\u2019ll be taking flash shots. On-camera diffusers simply attach to your camera, covering the flash with some kind of material to soften the light. There are many different models and types, each providing a slightly different approach to diffusing the light. For example, some work by bouncing light off the ceiling and directing the rest straight toward the subject through the fabric. Others reflect the flash off a panel in the on-camera diffuser before directing it through the fabric at the subject."

          "headline":"Try a variety of softboxes for different effects.",
          "description":"Softboxes, also called lightbanks, are rectangular enclosures that you place over the light source (usually your flash) to soften it. These versatile tools create diffused, directional light, such as the kind that would stream in through a window. Soft boxes come in many different sizes. In general, the larger the softbox, the softer and more diffused the light will be. Most softboxes work by using a reflective material lining that bounces the light through the sheer fabric. If you use a softbox, make sure that it can handle the wattage of light you\u2019re using. Using the wrong softbox can create a fire hazard."

          "description":"Photography umbrellas are easy-to-use tools that diffuse light two different ways \u2013 by bouncing the light off its surface or by diffusing the light through it. Similar to a softbox, an umbrella is attached to the light source. They are typically made of white cloth or a metallic silver material. Both types diffuse light effectively and are very affordable (some cost less than twelve dollars). To diffuse light by bouncing it, aim the light source at a silver or white umbrella, which should target the light away from the subject. To diffuse the light through an umbrella, use one made from sheer material. Aim the light source toward the subject, placing the umbrella in front of the light source."

These papers create an even field of soft light and they are best used to slightly soften up the overall look of a shot. They are sold with different finishes to create different lighting effects and look a lot like tracing paper. These light diffusing materials are quite affordable, but if you\u2019re forced to improvise, try using wax paper instead. A similar effect can be achieved. Wax paper should only be used to diffuse LED lighting. Avoid using wax paper with tungsten lights, since the paper could possibly catch on fire."

When placed between the light source and your subject, a silk can very effectively diffuse light. If you\u2019re on a budget, a similar effect can be achieved by using a sheer piece of fabric you already have around, like a white bed sheet or clear shower curtain liner. Though this approach won\u2019t give you the same results that a more professional diffuser will, it does serve to soften the light and to reduce harsh transitions and shadows. You can use any type of light-colored sheer fabric as a diffuser. In a pinch, you can even use a tissue as a diffuser."

They are able to diffuse light in almost every direction simultaneously, making them very versatile. Chinese lanterns come in many different sizes and colors. The all-white ones are best for diffusing light in a typical way. Experiment with colored lanterns if you are trying to create unusual lighting effects. You can buy China balls online, at most home d\u00e9cor shops and at Asian markets. To get an idea of how China balls can be used \u2013 you could hang several of them from the ceiling to softly brighten up a scene, or you could use a single lantern to light a more intimate shot, such as a dinner conversation in a restaurant."

Attach it to the flash with Velcro, gaffer\u2019s tape or a rubber band. After wrapping the bubble material around the flash, be sure to leave plenty of room over the top.
