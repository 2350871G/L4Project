A mint mark is a small letter on a coin, which identifies where the coin was minted, though not all coins have one. The mint mark is pretty inconspicuous, so if you\u2019re having trouble finding it, you might want to ask a coin dealer for help. Coins made in the US from 1965-1967 don\u2019t have mint marks. For example, coins made in Philadelphia will often have a \u201cP,\u201d while coins minted in Mexico under the Spanish will have an \u201cM.\u201d\nAvoid touching your coins to keep the value high. If your coin isn\u2019t in a holder, only hold it by the edges to avoid getting your finger oils on it. Use white gloves or coin tweezers when working with the coin.
