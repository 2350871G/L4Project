          "description":"Typically, 8 is the perfect number of dinner party events, but you can invite more or less people depending on your plans. Invite your guests no more than 3 weeks ahead of time, or they may forget about the event. To make your guests comfortable, it is helpful to invite guests that know each other already. If your guests don\u2019t know each other, be sure to help introduce them at your dinner party so everyone feels included."

It\u2019s okay if all of your guests do not eat gluten-free all the time, as long as they know what to expect and honor the food restrictions by not bringing food with gluten. This way, the dinner party can easily cater to gluten-free guests."

Some guests may also maintain a vegan, vegetarian, or ketogenic diet. Knowing the food preferences of all of your guests ahead of time helps you prepare an all-inclusive menu. If a few of your guests are vegetarian or vegan, you can still serve meat. Just put it on a separate plate, for instance. If any of your guests have serious food allergies, avoid picking menu items including that ingredient. For example, if someone is allergic to nuts and they eat a salad with almonds, they can have an allergic reaction."

To do this, ask each of your guests to prepare 1 dish large enough to share with the group. It is helpful to mention other dietary restrictions as well. Then, everyone can share what they brought for an easy dinner party option. This is a great option if you are on a budget or are unsure of what dishes to prepare.
