Understand the difference between the two so that you know what kind of problem you are facing. Moles are about six to eight inches long with slim snouts and small eyes and ears. They have gray or black fur and flat feet that look a bit like human hands. Gophers have gray, brown, or white fur, tiny eyes, ears, and whiskers. They do not have the same flat feet that characterize moles."

They are known to destroy utility cables and water lines in addition to your plants. Moles create tunnels often along the edge of a concrete road or a house. The tunnels can sometimes be seen from above ground, but are often invisible and beneath the surface. Tunnel exits show dirt piles that are circular and look like small volcanoes. Gopher tunnels are flatter than mole tunnels and do not run along the edge of man-made surfaces. The dirt mounds are shaped like semi-circles and often appear with a small hole in the center."

These are all smells that drive gophers away. Additionally, consider using a noise-maker like wind chimes or radios to scare off gophers.

Traps kill the rodent and are recommended for gardens or farms. Traps are reusable, and, unlike baits, they do not present the risk of poisoning other living beings or harming your crops. Try pincher traps, box traps, and black hole traps for gophers. These traps will either choke or smash the gopher causing it to die. Try cinch traps, scissor traps, and choker loop traps for moles. These traps will either smash, choke, or impale the gopher as it passes through. Avoid live traps. Live traps are not recommended because rodents often urinate and carry lice or ticks. This may later spread disease throughout your area. Gophers have an acute sense of smell. Wear gloves to cover up your human scent when setting a trap. Wash the trap with dish soap right before placing it in the hole. Afterward, cover the trap with leaves.
