Set your iron to warm or medium and iron over the paper. Do not use steam while ironing. The heat from the iron will cause the remaining wax to melt off of the tablecloth and soak into the paper. Repeat the ironing process if necessary using fresh paper towels or brown paper bags. Keep changing the paper and repeating the ironing until all wax is removed. Launder the tablecloth as usual once all the wax is gone."
