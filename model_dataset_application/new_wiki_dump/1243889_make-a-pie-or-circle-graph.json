Mark each sector with a pen or pencil as you measure out each sector until the entire circle contains all the values.

Put nominal data or ordinal data in a pie chart. Nominal data is data that can be categorized by descriptive or qualitative information. It is data that can be named, or made nominal. For example, a country of birth or a type of pet would be nominal data. Ordinal data is data that is set in a specific order. It can also be named and easily categorized but it is ranked, from lowest to highest, or from biggest to smallest, etc. For example, the hottest time of the year or the most popular movie genre would be ordinal data.
