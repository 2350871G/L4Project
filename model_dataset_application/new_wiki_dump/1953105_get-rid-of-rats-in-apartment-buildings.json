          "description":"Trapping rats is the safest way to get rid of them, and you can reuse traps as many times as you need to, so they're cost-efficient. You can use wooden rat-size snap traps, but the plastic versions are easier to set up, are less likely to misfire, and have a higher kill rate, so they're more humane. You can also try a wooden snap box trap, which is better for outside. It is similar to a snap trap but has built up walls around it. These traps prevent other larger animals from getting killed by the trap.

Avoid placing them in hallways, inside apartments where pets or children live, or in the walking areas of basements. Try a box trap to avoid trapping larger pets, like cats or dogs. Notify residents that you will be setting rat traps. Tell them where they will be located so that they can monitor their children and pets.

Place traps near these areas because the rats will frequent them. If you want to set a trap in the ceiling, it\u2019s okay to set them on top of panels. If there are no panels, you\u2019ll have to go into the attic. Listen for scurrying and scratching, then place the traps nearby. Most traps should be near a wall or the side of a large appliance.

You\u2019ll need to read the label on your poison carefully in case there are any specific instructions that you need to follow.

This can help protect larger animals and children from ingesting the poison, although you should never place rat poison near areas where children might play. Some commercial poisons come already contained in bait boxes. If the one you choose doesn\u2019t, you\u2019ll need to buy the box separately. You can find these wherever pest control products are sold. Tip: Even when you use a bait box, poison can be an environmental hazard.

Other good places include behind or under appliances, walls, and pipes, or inside a rat hole, if you\u2019ve found one.
