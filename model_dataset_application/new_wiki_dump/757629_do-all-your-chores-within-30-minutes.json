Return everything you moved back to your sink, toilet, and tub. Grab any dirty linens and throw them directly in the washing machine or laundry hamper. Scrubbing Bubbles is a great all-purpose product for bathroom cleaning. Allocate ten minutes to clean your bathroom. If you have time, wipe down the bathroom mirrors as well."

If you have dirty dishes lying around, return those to the kitchen. Allocate five minutes to clean your bedroom.

If not, pile all the dishes into the sink and let the hot water run. While the water runs, wipe down all the surfaces in the kitchen using a rag and some disinfectant. When your surfaces are wiped, wash the dishes and load them into the drying rack. Allocate ten minutes to clean your kitchen. Empty the trash you\u2019ve been carrying around from the living room into your kitchen trash can. If your pots and pans are scorched through, fill the pans with water and a cup of vinegar, then allow them to simmer on the stove. Remove the pan from the stove, add two tablespoons of baking soda, then scrub the pans till they\u2019re clean. If your backsplash is covered in oil from cooking, use a damp paper towel with some soap to cut through the grease."

If you have six chores to do in that time, find six songs lasting five minutes each and make a playlist. Play the playlist while you work and as soon as the song changes, switch tasks. Make sure you\u2019ve completed each task to the best of your ability before moving onto the next one. If you have fewer chores, choose longer songs or set a timer for the amount of time it takes to do each chore. Use fun as motivation. If your favorite TV show comes on at a certain time, start your chores thirty minutes before that time. That way, you\u2019ll be motivated to finish your chores within those thirty minutes in order to catch your show."

Ask your sibling if you can trade chores for the week; if they usually empty the dishwasher, ask if you can swap your laundry chore for that task. However you want to mix it up, switching chores will make the work more challenging and interesting. If you\u2019re going to trade chores, make sure you both hold up your end of the bargain. The work still needs to get done. If you\u2019re spending time cleaning their room, be respectful of their property. If you betray their trust, they may not want to trade chores again."

Turn your chores into a race with your siblings or parents to see who can get their work done the fastest. Turn on some music and have a dance party while you work. Whatever it takes to make your chores more enjoyable, do that. You can\u2019t win the game if your work is done sloppily, so make sure to be thorough. Ask your parents to help you find a phone app that tracks and rewards chore performance. Check out Chore Wars, which gives you experience points for completing household tasks."
