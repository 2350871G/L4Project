  "text":" Preparing the Fabric Pre-wash the fabric. This prevents shrinkage after sewing and also takes care of any dye runs that might occur. Follow the washing instructions for the fabric you're using. Dry and press before using. Cut the fabric into 45 x 5 inch strips.  Fold the strips in half lengthwise. Face the patterned side out to form a 45 x 2.5 inch strip. Press with a hot iron. Sewing the Neck Coolers Stitch down the length of the strip \u20444 inch (0.6 cm) from the open edge back stitching. Do this at both ends to make a tube. Stitch one end of the tube closed. Stitch it at a 45 degree angle to enhance its appearance. Turn the tube inside out. Using an unsharpened pencil, knitting needle or chopstick, turn the tube right-side-out. Fold the tube in half. Then mark the half-way point. Measure and mark points 4 inches (10.2 cm) and 8 inches (20.3 cm) on both sides of the half-way point to make 5 even marks down the length of the tube. Sew a line. At the mark closest to the closed end of the tube, stitch across the width of the tube. Adding the Cooling Crystals Pour in 1/4 teaspoon of the absorbent polymer crystals. Make sure they all fall down to the line you've just stitched across the fabric. Stitch another line. Stitch across the width of the tube at the next mark. Repeat stitching lines and adding crystals until you have stitched across the tube at each of the 5 marks. There will now be 4 closed pockets in the center of the tube, each filled with absorbent polymer crystals. Fold in the open end of the tube. Stitch it closed. Again, stitch it closed at a 45 degree angle for a neat appearance. Trim the thread ends. The neck cooler is now finished. Using the Neck Cooler To use your neck cooler, soak in cool water for 5 to 15 minutes. Pat dry with a towel. Tie around your neck or forehead and you will stay cool for hours. Rinse with cold water before drying. This removes your sweat and anything else that has attached to it during wear. Hang to dry (it will take a couple of days to dry out). Rehydrate by soaking in water again.",
