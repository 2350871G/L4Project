      "description":"Cut each ball into 4 equal pieces. Roll these pieces into large, flat ovals. For standard-sized wontons, cut 3 1/2 inch (8.9 cm) squares from these ovals. Use these small squares of dough as your wrappers in your wonton recipe. You may want to dust each square lightly with flour so that they'll become adhesive with the addition of water and/or cool the squares in the refrigerator for firmness. Use these homemade wrappers the same way as you'd use pre-made wrappers - see How to Wrap Wontons for more information."
