Be sure to measure the weight of your turkey, along with the length and width, ahead of time so you can pick out a large enough platter. If your turkey is big, you might want to avoid platters that are made of thin plastics that might buckle under the weight. Keep in mind that stuffing will add extra weight to your turkey. Try and look for sturdy ceramic or glass platters that will be able to withstand the weight of your display."

Not all plastic platters are heat-resistant and might wind up melting or cracking. Look for platters that have a slight well in them to hold the warm juices and garnishes. You can purchase a platter at your local grocery store or the kitchen section of a local department store. You will most likely find a wider variety of platters during the fall and winter holiday seasons, but simple colors and designs will be offered year-round.

If you plan to add a lot of fruits or vegetables around the turkey, you probably don't want to pick a platter with a bold design. The display may look busy, or you may not be able to see the beautiful platter if it's covered with garnish! Find a platter with a simple design if you\u2019re using colorful garnishes. It can be a simple white or neutral color with a minimal inlet design. This is also a great option if the place setting you are using is neutrally colored as well. Pick a bold design to complement a plain turkey. If you want to minimally decorate the platter, opt for a sturdy platter that has a festive inlet or color design on it. This will add to your overall presentation without you having to pile on extra edibles to dress up the turkey."

This is also a good way to present a turkey that is too heavy to carry to the table. Simply carve the turkey into even slices that are about \u20444 inch (1.9 cm) thick, so each slice is large enough to retain its juices. Then arrange breast meat so the slices are slightly resting on top of each other like fallen dominos. Then place additional legs or dark meat at the ends of the platter.

Opt for herb flavors that will complement the turkey meat and not take away from it. Herbs like rosemary, thyme, and sage are common flavors already found within traditional turkey seasonings, and will accent the turkey meat nicely. If you do not want the flavor from the herbs to taint your turkey, opt for using lettuce or kale leaves instead. The lettuce or kale leaves will create a neutral base for the turkey to rest on, and add a hearty texture to your platter design. You can also line the platter with a clean terry-towel instead of edible greens to keep the turkey from slipping. This method is good if you want to use minimal greens on your platter."

A quick remedy is to fill these empty spaces with a variety of fruits that are left whole and sliced. Along with filling out the platter, the fruit will also add contrasting colors to the dish. Opt for sweet or tart apples, and citrusy oranges and lemons to fill the larger pockets. Then to fill the small pockets, add plucked grapes or fresh cranberries. These vibrant colors set on a bed of leafy greens is a refreshing color design for meals served early on in the day. If you have access to an apple, orange, or lemon tree, consider leaving part of the stem and leaves on the fruit. Once you wash the leaves and fruit thoroughly, they can be sporadically placed around the platter. The leaves will provide a pop of earthy green and contrast beautifully with your golden, brown turkey."

          "description":"For a less sweet or vibrantly colored display, incorporate the earthy tones of vegetables into your platter. The vegetables can be roughly chopped to fill in empty spaces or can be cut into smaller pieces and steamed for a softer texture. Some excellent vegetable options include, squash, potatoes, carrots, parsnips, onions, and garlic. To add warmth to the design, layer cooked vegetables and fruits with the turkey. The fruits and vegetables will become tender and marinate in the turkey juices, and provide an extra sweet flavor to the turkey meat as well. Peel some carrots, and slice some onions, mushrooms, and apples into large chunks, and scatter them into the bottom of the pan you are baking the turkey in. These flavors will match the flavors within the turkey seasoning. For extra flavor, add some sprigs of thyme as well. Just make sure to leave the sprigs of thyme large enough to be picked off by people, so they do not choke on the stems."

          "description":"This will simply add an earthy texture and crunch to your platter. Before doing this, make sure that no one you are serving has a nut allergy. Some good nuts to accent the turkey flavors are almonds, chestnuts, walnuts, pecans, and hazelnuts. If you want to add a zing of color and flavor, add some shelled pistachio nuts. The green color will pop against the golden-brown turkey."
