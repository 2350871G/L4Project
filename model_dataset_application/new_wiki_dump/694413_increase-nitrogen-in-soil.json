If you're in the middle of a growth season and your plants are suffering from nutritional deficiency, consider using chemical fertilizer to revive them. You can buy a wide range of chemical fertilizers at any home improvement center or nursery. Keep in mind that chemical fertilizers are not a long-term solution.

          "description":"When it comes to chemical fertilizers, the formulas make a big difference. If you're trying to boost nitrogen in your vegetable garden, buy fertilizer made specifically for vegetables. If your lawn needs a nitrogen boost, get a fertilizer formulated for grass. Specific formulas will release nutrients in a targeted way that is ideal for that plant type."

          "description":"All fertilizers are categorized by a 3 number rating system. The first number is nitrogen (N), the second number is phosphorous (P), and the third is potassium (K). These numbers represent the percentage of each nutrient found in the fertilizer. Always check the N-P-K before purchasing a product."

A 21-0-0 fertilizer will deliver only nitrogen to your soil. You can use a balanced blend like 10-10-10 or 15-15-15 if your soil needs all 3 nutrients replenished."

          "headline":"Go with a quality, slow release fertilizer.",
          "description":"Slow release or controlled release fertilizers may cost a little more, but in the long run they are the best choice. With slow release formulas, you will be fertilizing your soil less frequently because they are longer lasting. They're also more effective because they release nutrients slowly and steadily. Cheaper products can sometimes shock and burn plants, causing a horde of new problems. Since chemical fertilizers can negatively affect the soil over time, less frequent applications can help preserve the health of your soil. Slow release fertilizers often come in the form of pellets."

It will take several months for your compost to \u201cripen\u201d enough for use. Start the composting process in early summer so it will be ready by the following spring planting season. Some other ingredients to use include tea bags, old condiments, rotting bread, corn cobs, leftover nut shells, fruit rinds, and much more. In the case of shells (from shellfish, nuts, or eggs) and fruit pits, it\u2019s best to smash them up with a hammer or another heavy tool before putting them in compost.
