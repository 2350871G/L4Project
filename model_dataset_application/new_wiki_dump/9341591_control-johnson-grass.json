If you till less frequently than this, it will break up the Johnson grass rhizomes, but not completely destroy them. That means that the broken-up rhizomes can eventually spread to other areas."

A week or so before you\u2019re going to harvest your crops, spray them with Roundup. Spraying Roundup near harvest should break up the rhizomes enough that they come up when you harvest.
