Use your clean forefinger to level the grounds in the portafilter once it\u2019s filled. Use a tamper, which is a flat metal disk with a rubber handle, to compact the coffee grounds into the portafilter. Apply about 30 pounds (14 kg) of pressure. You can practice this by pressing on your bathroom scale until it reaches  30 pounds (14 kg) to get a feel for how much pressure to apply. Portafilters are small metal dishes with long handles that can be attached to the grouphead. The filter screen in the portafilter is called the basket."
