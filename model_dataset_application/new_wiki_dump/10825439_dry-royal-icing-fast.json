Place the dehumidifier in the same room as your baked goods, turn it on, and place it on the highest setting. Leave it turned on until the icing is completely dry. If you don\u2019t have a dehumidifier, turn on the cool air-conditioning instead. This also helps to prevent the icing from losing its shape."

If a light doesn\u2019t come on automatically, select the light icon on your oven or turn the dial to the correct setting. If you don't want to use an oven, use a heat lamp instead. Place the tray into the middle of the oven to allow for maximum airflow."

          "headline":"Place a fan near the baked goods to increase the airflow that it receives.",
          "description":"Position the fan on the middle setting and place it at least 1 metre (3.3 ft) away from the baked goods so that the airflow doesn\u2019t cause the icing to bleed or change shape. If you notice the icing losing its shape, simply move the fan further away or turn down the wind speed. This works best on cakes or cookies with a single layer of icing, as multiple levels of icing are more fragile and tend to be affected by the strong wind from a fan."

          "description":"A heat gun is a rather specialist piece of equipment, but it is incredibly effective and may be a useful purchase if you do a lot of baking. Hold the heat gun about 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from the icing and wait for it to dry. This normally only takes a few minutes. Purchase a heat gun online or from a speciality baking store."

If your kitchen is particularly humid, place your baking in another room where the air is cooler and drier. However, make sure to choose a spot where the baking won\u2019t be knocked over or eaten by pets or children."

The cold and damp air in the fridge doesn\u2019t allow the icing to dry and can make your baking go soft. Similarly, avoid putting your baked goods in the freezer to dry, as the condensation can ruin the icing."

Unfortunately, this often causes condensation and humidity, which slows the drying process. If you don\u2019t have much room in your kitchen, consider placing your baked goods on a desk or table instead."
