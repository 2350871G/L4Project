  "text":" Choosing a Style Decorate with raised panel wainscoting to add elegance to a room. Raised panel wainscoting features a raised rectangular frame on each panel. Use a raised panel style if you want the room you\u2019re decorating to have a classic, upscale look. Choose beadboard wainscoting for informal rooms. You can decorate a stairway or bathroom with beadboard to give it dimension while still keeping things simple. Beadboard wainscoting has thin, vertical strips that run up and down the paneling. Use flat panel wainscoting for a simple, contemporary feel in a room. Flat panel wainscoting is similar to raised panel, but it\u2019s simpler. Flat panel wainscoting is a good choice if you want a space to have a clean, finished appearance. Use board and batten for wainscoting that extends high up on the wall. Board and batten wainscoting is generally taller than other types of wainscoting.

The unfinished wood could rot if it gets wet. Instead, use a water-resistant wainscoting like PVC or seal off wooden wainscoting with a protective finish. Adding Color and Stain to Wainscoting Do any painting or staining before you install the wainscoting. It\u2019s much easier to paint or stain wainscoting before it\u2019s up on the wall. If you want the wainscoting to be a specific color, the first thing you should do is set up a work station in a well-ventilated area and get all of the panels painted or stained. Install colorful wainscoting to make a space more bright and modern. Paint the wainscoting a bold accent color and install it over a white or neutral-colored wall so it really stands out. For example, you could install teal raised panel wainscoting over the gray walls in the living room for an elegant and modern finish. Stain wainscoting with polyurethane to give it an antique look. Put it up in a space that has antique furniture or a wooden fireplace mantel to tie the room together. Install white wainscoting over a brightly-colored accent wall. The stark contrast between the white wainscoting and the accent wall will make the accent color pop even more. For example, if you have tangerine walls in your dining room, you could install white flat panel wainscoting along the bottom perimeter of the walls to make them pop. Getting Creative with the Installation Install beadboard wainscoting in bathrooms for an easy upgrade. Use the wainscoting to give a bathroom more dimension, especially if the walls are white or neutral. Go with a color that pairs well with the bathroom walls and tiling. Create wainscoting headboards in the bedrooms. Choose a wainscoting style and install the panels along the base of all the walls in the bedroom. When you get to where the head of the bed is positioned against the wall, extend the wainscoting up to the ceiling. The wainscoting will look like a headboard that\u2019s built right into the wall. Add a shelf to the top of the wainscoting. This is commonly seen with the board and batten style.
