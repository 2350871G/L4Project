  "text":" Lay the T-shirt out on a flat surface, front side facing up. Cut off any tags inside and outside of the shirt. Cut off the hem of the shirt from one side to the other. Then start at one armpit of the shirt and cut across to the other side. You are now left with the middle of the shirt. Put the hem and top of the shirt off to the side.  With the body of the shirt, cut \u00be\u201d to 1\u201d wide strips from one folded end all the way through to the other. This will leave you with multiple loops. Stretch each loop as far as you can. You will want them to be as long as possible so that your scarf will hang lower. You will see that the loops start to curl and become thinner. Do this to each loop, and put three of them off to the side. Cut each loop at one end to make them long strips. Stretch them a little more so they will be as long as possible. Also, do the same to the three strips that you left to the side. Gather all of the strips and make them even. Carefully lay them down so none of them fall out of place. Grab one of the strips that you left to the side and tie it around the end of the strips that you gathered. Divide the strips into three equal parts and begin to braid. Make sure that you pull the braid tight as you go along. You want to leave about half of scarf unraveled. Grab one of your other strips that you left to the side and tie it around the bottom of your braid making a double knot. Don't worry about the extra fabric from the ties, you can cut them off at the end. Run your fingers through the rest of the strips to make sure they are untangled and even.  Grab your third strip that you left to the side, and tie the top of the braid to the bottom of the strips together. You now have a complete circle with some extra fabric from your ties hanging from it. Cut off the rest of the fabric from all of your ties as low as you can.  Congratulations, you now have your very own braided t-shirt scarf! Place the scarf over your head and move it around to where you like it.",
