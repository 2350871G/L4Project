      "description":"Use wire tools to bend the thicker wire into a horse shoe shape. Avoid overworking the wire. It will become hard and brittle if you bend it too much. Use smooth, minimal movements. The shape should fit comfortably around the finger. Form a small loop at one end. Try on the ring and mark the other loop position. Both loops should not be above the top of the finger."

      "headline":"Attach the 1st stringing wire.",
      "description":"Tie the middle of a long strand of thin wire around one loop. Lay the pearls out in a dish or towel so you can see them and decide which one will be in the center. A large center bead surrounded by smaller ones looks the best."

    {
      "headline":"Add your beads.",
      "description":"Begin stringing different pearls and pull the wire through the other loop to create the base string. Try the ring on for size. It should fit comfortably over the knuckle. Adjust if necessary. Make additional strings of pearls no tighter than the base string."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Attach the 2nd wire.",
      "description":"With the next wire, position the large pearl in the middle. Be careful not to make this wire too tight. Keep the strands together by pulling a wire around the strands. You should have at least three strands (an uneven number) going across to keep the large pearl in the middle."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Create your style.",
      "description":"String as many pearls as you want and occasionally tie the strands together. You may like the look of silver wires criss-crossing around the pearls as they hold the pearls in place. Tie off the two wire ends with knots to secure them. Tuck the wire ends into the cluster out of sight. Trim with scissors or wire cutters. One option would be to string the pearls together and rolling it out to form a cluster. Place it in position, then weave another wire mesh around the cluster and attach the loose end of the mesh wire to the ring loops on your finger."

      "headline":"Attach no hole beads.",
      "description":"If the beads do not have any holes, you can still cluster them by gluing the pieces together with a hot glue gun. Make sure that the hot glue does not react with the materials you are using. Now weave a wire mesh around the glued and dried cluster. Make sure the ends of the wire mesh are long enough to be looped around the thicker finger wire."
