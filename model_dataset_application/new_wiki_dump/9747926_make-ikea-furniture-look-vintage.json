          "description":"Hold the paint can several inches away from the object's surface and spray it in sweeping layers. Make the first coat any color of your choice and the second a faux-rusty brown. Once you've reached the desired aged look, let your spray paint dry. To make the furniture look even more weathered, sand the furniture's edges down after spray painting it. You can purchase spray paint at most craft or home improvement stores. Gold spray paint in particular can add an older, regal feel to furniture. You can spray paint the entire piece gold or use it to embellish specific parts of the furniture (like the knobs, siding, or crown molding). To spray specific sections of the furniture gold, cover any areas you don't want to paint with kraft paper and masking tape."

Cut a strip of felt to the size of your handle, using the old handle as an approximate guide. Make two holes on either side of the strip and fasten it onto the furniture with nails or screws. You could also make leather handles as an alternative if you want to use a sturdier material."

Rust your metal gradually to avoid over-aging your furniture and accidentally damaging its functionality. If you decide that you don't like the look of rusty metal, restore it with a chemical rust remover, acidic solution, or electrolysis. These methods can repair the object but may not return it to its original state, so think carefully before you rust your furniture."
