  "text":" Cleaning and Storing your Cherry Tomatoes Clean your cherry tomatoes. First of all you should quickly rinse the tomatoes in cool water to make sure they are clean and ready to eat. Before you prepare food and cook always remember to wash your hands too. Place them in a bowl. Do not rub or pat the tomatoes dry, but place them in a bowl with paper towels at the bottom.

You don\u2019t want water and dampness to be trapped in the bowl. The resulting condensation can turn your tomatoes bad, even moldy, relatively quickly. You can leave them in the fridge until you are ready to roast them. Preparing to Roast Grab an aluminum pan to roast in.
