This is the simplest way to set about harvesting rainwater, as all it requires you to do is set out a few containers to catch what drains off of the roof. Standard 5\u201d gutters with 3\u201d downspouts will be large enough for most average-sized homes. For roofs with significantly more surface area, you may need to replace smaller gutters with slightly larger 6\u201d gutters with 4\u201d downspouts to control the flow of water. In general, sheet metal roofing make the best surfaces for collecting rainwater.

You can configure the pipes as needed to create a makeshift irrigation system and carry the water where it will be most useful. Durable materials like copper or aluminum pipes or PVC tubing make for long-lasting channels that won't introduce any other harmful compounds to the runoff water.
