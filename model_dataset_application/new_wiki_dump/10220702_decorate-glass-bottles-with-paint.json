          "headline":"Create designs for the inside of the bottle.",
          "description":"If you want simple designs to appear imprinted on the bottle, use foam stickers to cut the designs. Simple shapes or letters work best. If you are using letters in your design, remember to cut them in reverse. To complete the process:\nInsert the foam stickers into the bottle. If the neck of the bottle is narrow, use a utility knife to carefully feed the sticker into the jar. Once your sticker is in the jar, use a pencil or any other long, narrow object to press the sticker against the side of the jar. Wrap your bottle in a plastic bag. Tape the bag to the neck of the jar to keep it in place. Set the wrapped bottle in a tarped area or in a box. Put on some gloves, while you\u2019re at it. These measures will help you avoid getting paint anywhere you don\u2019t want it. Insert the spray paint nozzle into the jar. Spray a layer of paint into the jar or bottle. Wait a few minutes and spray another layer. Rotate the glass bottle so that the paint covers the entire inside. After the bottles are completely dry, remove the foam stickers from the inside of the bottles with a utility knife. If you notice that a little paint dripped into one of your covered areas, you might be able to scrape this off with your utility knife.This can happen if the sticker did not fully adhere."

Make sure that you have enough space in the area that you\u2019re working in, and that you don\u2019t get too close to the bottles when you spray paint. This could cause dripping and uneven areas on your finished bottles. Add a second coat if needed."

          "description":"Always follow the recommendations on the label for dry times, which can vary depending on the brand and type of paint. Leaving them to dry overnight also works well, as this will allow the paint to fully set before you touch or move the bottles."

          "headline":"Add your own decorative touches.",
          "description":"For simple bottles, adding a flower or candle to the bottle creates an elegant look that\u2019s great for holidays or special occasions. If you want something a little fancier, you can use ribbons, lace, decals or beads. A craft box full of scraps and leftovers is a great place to look for finishing touches and extra decorations for the outside of the bottle."

Acrylic enamel paints or acrylic glass paints are generally the easiest to use for glass-painting projects. Solvent-based paints are not a good idea for any glassware you intend to wash on a regular basis. Always read the labels thoroughly before selecting a paint. Choose a type of brush. There is no specific type of brush required, but some paint manufacturers may recommend a particular type of brush for their paints.
