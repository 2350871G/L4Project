You'll have more fun and create a more meaningful scrapbook if you choose a theme that's important to you. Some popular themes for scrapbooks include: family vacations, holidays, graduations, births, weddings, friends, or school."

If you're looking for an older specific date, it may take you longer to find photographs or materials to use. While you can easily find material online, try looking for personal materials. Ask family members for photographs, family trees, or souvenirs that they've collected over time."

If you think of something pithy or engaging, you may be able to use it as part of the text in your final product. Talk to family members or friends involved in the memory to gather their memories or thoughts. You can also use these for the scrapbook."

Gluing sheets of construction paper on top of one another will create a three-dimensional impression. Make the layers progressively smaller as you stack them to create an image that really stands out.

Colors can make you feel an immediate emotional response so decide what tone you want to convey for each page. For example, warm colors (like reds, yellows, and oranges) are energizing. You may want to use these colors for a sports or athletic scrapbook page. Cool colors (like blues, greens, and purples) are calming. These would be good colors to use for baby scrapbooks or relaxing vacations. Neutral colors (like browns and grays) are considered safe to use in most any situation."

With this in mind, every bit of planning you do for a scrap page should keep the amount of space in mind. Discard less important ideas in favor of better ones and give the central ideas more space. Placement on the page is also important to consider. In general, the center of a page will be the most eye-catching. You can put less important concepts on the borders or edges."

This will let color pop out where there may not have been any otherwise. Marker and watercolor paints are perfect for adding color between the cracks. If you use paint, allow the page time to dry before gluing on your images. You can also use patterned paper as a foundation for your scrap page. For example, use a patterned paper for your border or use cut-out shapes to add meaning to the page."

Because you'll have space for a limited number of photos, it is best to give the most space to the best photo, downsizing less important images for use on the sides of your page. Depending on your smartphone, you may even be able to resize photos using a photo editing application."

Choose an acid-free adhesive or use photo tabs to stick the photo onto your cardstock. Mark the page with a ruler so that you center the image correctly. If you don't want to use cardstock, you can stick the photo directly onto the scrapbook page or onto another piece of scrapbook paper. Just be sure to use paper that's larger than your image so you end up with a border."

Regardless of if it's a picture of a vacation, party or family reunion, saying a bit about where it is and why you were there will bring the memories rushing back. You should write up your text as a draft on another sheet of paper before writing it on the final copy. This will allow you to focus on the aesthetic of the text itself and figure out exactly what it is you would like to say before writing it permanently."

Poetry and song lyrics are perfect in this sense, as they often communicate feelings better than regular prose would. You can also include favorite inspiration quotes or quote people who were involved in the activity that the scrapbook page describes."

Buy a few sheets of stickers from the dollar store and tack them around certain images as a border. It helps the effect if the stickers are somehow applicable to the theme of the scrapbook. For example, for a scrapbook page about a trip to the beach, you could use seashell stickers. Or, for a baby shower scrapbook page, stick on baby rattle and pacifier stickers."

Then, be sure to store it in a book or folder where it won't be damaged. You can use a purchased scrapbook by filling in the pages. Or, you can make single scrapbook pages and have them professionally bound. This may preserve the scrapbook best."
