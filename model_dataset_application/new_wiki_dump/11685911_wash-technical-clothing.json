Most technical clothing can be washed in the washing machine as long as you don\u2019t use regular detergent or fabric softeners\u2014a specialty outerwear detergent is best.For dark-colored clothing, check the tag to see if you should wash it inside out to keep the color from fading. You shouldn\u2019t wash down jackets in a top-loading machine because the garment could snag and tear on the center agitator during the spin cycle. Note any icons on the tag: an image of a hand reaching into a bucket of water means hand-washing is recommended. Two dots mean warm water while 3 mean hot water.
