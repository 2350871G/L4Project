In the video game Banjo-Kazooie the final boss' music was very catchy and a remix of the hub world theme, but rather Grant Kirkhope (the game's music composer) used just about every instrument but organ and opera. However, feel free to do what you want so long as it ain't copyright infringement."

If it's pretty easy with these collectibles then by all means omit them to make the final boss all the more challenging. A save point and a few treasure chests is a must, especially in the RPG genre."

If you can't do that then take bits and pieces from many other memorable final boss fights and meld them together until it's virtually recognizable of the other elements. If you can't do that, then remix it off of a regular boss but make it much tougher."
