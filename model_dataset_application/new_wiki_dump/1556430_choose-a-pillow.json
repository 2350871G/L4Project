          "description":"Although you may already have a pretty good idea about your preferred position, it is good to take a few nights to confirm it. When you are getting ready to fall asleep, spend a few minutes on your back, on your side, and on your stomach. See which one feels the most comfortable for you. If you spend half an hour on your stomach and you haven\u2019t fallen asleep, it\u2019s probably not your preferred position. Try to be aware of the position you are in when you wake up in the morning. Write down the position you woke up in so you can compare over a few days."

          "description":"Now that you have spent time thinking about and discovering your preferred sleeping position, it\u2019s time to decide. This is an important decision, as it will guide you to your perfect pillow. If you are a stomach sleeper, you will need a soft, fairly flat pillow, or you may not need any pillow at all. Having a soft pillow will allow your neck to stay more in line with your spine. If you are a back sleeper, look for a medium thick pillow. You don\u2019t want it to be too thick, or it will push your head too far forward. You also don\u2019t want it to be too soft, or your head will simply sink down to the mattress. In this case, you may want a pillow which is thicker and firmer on the bottom, to provide a bit of neck support. Side sleepers will need a thicker, firmer pillow to help support the neck. If you find that you are a mixed sleeper and you find many positions comfortable throughout the night, look for a pillow that is of medium thickness, and a bit softer so that it can be used comfortably in different positions"

More firmness, or loft, suits side sleepers while less loft is better for back or stomach sleepers. They can last up to 10 years and are resilient and breathable because they are made of a natural material. Be aware that there is a difference between a down pillow and a feather pillow. Down is very light and soft, and is usually located underneath the harder, stronger feathers, which protect the bird from the elements. A feather pillow will likely be harder, and there is a chance that some of the feather quills could poke through the fabric, particularly in cheaper feather pillows. Although there is no scientific evidence that down or feather pillows exacerbate allergies or asthma, some people prefer to avoid them. You might wish to avoid down/feather pillows for ethical reasons, or due to asthma or allergies. In this case, there are synthetic versions available."

Be aware that these pillows tend to be quite firm, so they may not be the most suitable for stomach sleepers.

The pillow also claims to help reduce tossing and turning throughout the night. Cervical pillows provide extra firmness in the lower part of the pillow in order to provide support for the neck. The claim is that these pillows will help reduce neck tension and headaches, however, there has not been sufficient research to back up this claim. Anti-snore pillows claim to help position the head so that the airways remain open by lifting the chin away from the chest. Cool pillows are designed to include fillings that absorb head heat in order to keep you feeling cool. Although they can be used by anyone who wishes to keep cool at night, they may be particularly suitable for someone suffering from hot flashes. Oxygen pillows are designed to promote the circulation of air, which is meant to help you breathe more freely and deeply while you sleep.
