You really only need to machine wash jeans once ever 4 to 6 weeks. If you notice any stains during this time frame, you can spot clean with household cleaners rather than throwing the jeans in the wash. If you're up to it, washing jeans by hand can be more gentle on them than machine washing."

You can also opt not to use detergent at all. Vinegar can be used as  replacement and may better preserve the color of your jeans. Detergent is meant to eliminate stains but often does not differentiate between stains and dye. Vinegar, on the other hand, will make for a milder wash, cleaning your jeans without removing dye. Vinegar has a strong smell, however. If you have a sensitive nose, using vinegar may be a bad idea."
