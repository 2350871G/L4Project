You should notice at this point you will have four \u201cT-shaped\u201d patterns surrounding the White face. Turn the cube around so the white face is facing away from you. Pick a color around the yellow center that is not yellow, and turn the cube so that color is on the side of the cube with the center that it matches. This will make a larger \u201cT-shape\u201d. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/4\\/45\\/Large-t-shape.PNG\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/4\\/45\\/Large-t-shape.PNG\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":473,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":780.9,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\nYou will notice that the Green/Red edge pair needs to be moved to the front face in the picture above. In order to do this, follow this algorithm:  F' D' R' T D R. After putting this in place, you will need to go back and resolve part of the White face using the strategies in the 3x3x3 approach. After repeating this about four times, you will have solved the top three layers of the cube. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/6\\/62\\/3-layers.PNG\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/6\\/62\\/3-layers.PNG\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":493,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":814.2857142857143,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Solve for a Yellow cross-shape. At this point when you turn your cube to the Yellow face you will see one of three possible patterns: an \u201cL-shape\u201d, a \u201cBar\u201d shape (yellow blocks in a straight line), or just the yellow center.For the L-shape, use this algorithm: F U R U' R' F'\nFor the Bar shape, use this algorithm: F R U R' U' F'\nIf you have just the yellow center, then choose either of the processes and do it twice. Solve for the Yellow corners. You will now have a Yellow cross on the face of the cube and you may have one or more Yellow corners as well. This step is to solve for the rest. Find one yellow corner not on the yellow face cube and turn it toward you. Follow this algorithm: R U R' U R U2 R'. Repeat this until the Yellow face is complete. Solve for the last layer. If you have any two corners on the same side matching, turn them to their matching side, and turn that face of the cube away from you for this next part. If you had no matching corners, repeat this step twice.Follow this algorithm: R' F R' B2 R F' R' B2 R2\n\n{\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/9\\/98\\/Final-step.PNG\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/9\\/98\\/Final-step.PNG\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":488,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":805.6,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Now, sometimes every side will be solved. However, once in a while, you may get a seemingly unsolvable case, called a parity. Now there are two cases you might run into. First, if the two sides are opposite each other, perform this algorithm: (Rr)2 B2 U2 (Ll) U2 (Rr)' U2 (Rr) U2 F2 (Rr) F2 (Ll)' B2 (Rr)2. If the two sides are adjacent to each other, first perform this algorithm: R U R'U', then perform the above algorithm, and finally, perform this algorithm: U R U' R' Your 4x4x4 Rubik's Cube is now solved!",
