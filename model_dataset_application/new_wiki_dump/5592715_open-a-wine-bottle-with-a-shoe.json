          "description":"Simple physics provides an explanation of how this method works. For this method, you put the bottle of wine into the shoe and bang the shoe sole on a wall. The force from the banging will help to loosen the cork and it will start to come out. The force travels through the liquid and transfers to the cork. Since the liquid isn't free flowing inside the wine bottle, it acts like a solid and allows the force to transmit to the cork."

          "description":"Don't use just any type of shoes, as anything with a soft sole or high heel won't work. The shoes you choose should have solid, hard soles. The opening in the shoe should fit a wine bottle nicely. Make sure the shoes are a good sturdy pair. Shoes that are old and flimsy won't allow the force from the banging to transmit to the wine bottle well. Men's dress shoes tend to work very well for this method."

          "description":"These shoes won't work well for a number of reasons. Athletic shoes have cushioned rubber soles that absorb force. The soles of athletic shoes are often too padded to transmit force into the wine bottle. High heels don't have enough surface area on the sole to transmit enough force. They may also snap when you bang the heel against the wall."
