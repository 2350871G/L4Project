There are a few exceptions to these: Base set cards, which were one of the first three sets released in America, do not have a symbol on the card. They are the only ones like this; and Promos, which only have one number denoting what number the card is (Ivy Pikachu, for example, is number 1 out of the first released series of Black Star Promos)."

After you've put them in sleeves, it's a good idea to put them either in \"top loaders\" (hard plastic cases to prevent bending) or in 9-pocket card sleeves that are held in binders.you can also use Ultra Pro deck Protector Sleeves which come in red, blue, green, etc. And both are fairly Cheap. Use plastic Binders and page Sleeves for easy storage. All of these things can be purchased at a Walmart store or a card collecting store, and the best brands to get are Ultra-Pro or Dragon Shield."

Then you see the trainers, and the cycle repeats, and if there are any Secret Rares, there will be a Pok\u00e9mon at the end of your set with stars. If not, that's fine too. Stars mean a Pok\u00e9mon is Rare, diamonds mean it is Uncommon, and circles mean Common. Rare cards sell, of course, for much more than the others. Note: If your cards are Japanese, and the star/diamond/circle symbol is white instead of black, it denotes an ultra rare card. Also, with Japanese cards, if the symbol is that of three stars, it is an ultra rare premium card\u2014the hardest cards to find!"
