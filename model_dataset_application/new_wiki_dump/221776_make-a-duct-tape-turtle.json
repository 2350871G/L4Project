  "text":" 2-D Duct Tape Turtle Make a square of duct tape cloth.  Scribe a circle on one side, using either a compass or by tracing a round object that's the size you would like your turtle's shell to be.  Fold a length of tape from end to end, leaving a flap of sticky area at one end.  Cut the folded tape in half lengthwise.  Round the folded ends with scissors to make \"feet\". Stick the feet to the bottom of your duct tape circle. Repeat for \"hind legs\".  Make another folded piece of tape but this time, cut it lengthwise with one piece twice as wide as the other. Round the big piece to form a head and cut the narrower piece to form the tail. Stick in place. Attach googly eyes to the head of the turtle if desired.  3-D Duct Tape Turtle Obtain a round lid or container such as a Mint tin.  Cover the container in duct tape, trimming excess from bottom edges.  Create a head by covering a small ball of tape in a strip, leaving a sticky tab.  Stick the head to the underside of the body.  Create feet and tail pieces by folding tape as shown, leaving an inch of sticky showing.  Cut out feet and tail.  Stick feet and tail to the underside of the lid/turtle.
