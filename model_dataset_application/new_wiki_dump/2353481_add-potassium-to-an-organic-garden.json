Muriate of potash tends to be cheaper, but the chlorine it contains can hurt the helpful microbes living in your garden's soil. Sulfate of potash is safer, but it\u2019s a bit more expensive.

If you use wood ash to supply the garden with potassium, it\u2019s best to regularly test the pH to make sure that the soil is balanced. Don\u2019t use wood ash around acid-loving plants, like azaleas or blueberries."

Greensand releases potassium at a slow rate, so it\u2019s better for long-term soil maintenance than quick adjustments. It also works as a conditioner and helps soil retain water.

If you\u2019re a serious gardener and want to maximize your crop, test your soil every season before you plant.

Keep a close eye on your plants if you know leaching could be an issue. If possible, test your soil more frequently. Amending your sandy soil with manure and well-rotted compost can help prevent leaching."

Potassium competes with magnesium most directly, so look for yellowing between leaves\u2019 veins. The veins themselves stay green, but the the spaces between them turn yellow. If you add potassium but notice yellowing occurs or worsens, just purchase an organic calcium-magnesium supplement or magnesium sulfate. Depending on your product, you\u2019ll either mix it into the soil or spray it onto your plant\u2019s bottom leaves."
