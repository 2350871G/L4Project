Adding the lime juice helps keep the avocado from browning because the acid in the juice helps lower the avocado's pH."

Use the fork to toss all of the ingredients together so they're lightly coated with the avocado mixture. If there are other vegetables that you'd like to add to the salad, such as chopped celery, mix them in with onion and tomatoes."
