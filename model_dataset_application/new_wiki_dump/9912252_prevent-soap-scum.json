          "description":"Choose a store-bought degreasing agent to remove existing soap scum. If your cleaning product has a spray bottle, you can pull the trigger to squirt it directly onto your shower walls. If your product has a pour cap instead, you can squeeze 2-5 dollops onto your rag or sponge, and wipe it across all your surfaces. You want an even, thin layer to cover each surface with soap scum. Purchase chemical cleaning products safe for bathrooms at most home supply or janitorial supply stores."

          "headline":"Use a non-acidic cleaner if you are cleaning natural stone tile.",
          "description":"If you have tiles made out of marble, slate, granite, or Travertine, it is best to use a cleaner that is gentle on these surfaces. You should also avoid using rough, abrasive scouring pads. Apply the gentle cleaner to the scummy areas with a soft kitchen sponge. Using harsh chemicals can damage your tile or result in discoloration. You can purchase this at most home supply or janitorial supply stores."

          "headline":"Mix baking soda and vinegar if you want to use a natural cleaner.",
          "description":"Measure 1 cup (236.60 g) of baking soda and pour it into a small bowl. Slowly add vinegar about 1/2 cup (118.30 g) at a time until you have a paste-like substance. Apply the mixture to your surfaces once it stops fizzing using a rag or sponge. The amount of vinegar you use will vary based on the consistency of your mix, though it should be about 1\u20132 cups (240\u2013470 mL). If you don't have baking soda, you can also combine equal amounts of vinegar and water in a spray bottle, and squeeze in 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of dish detergent. Spray the mixture on your soap scum when you are ready to clean."

Do this over the entirety of your surfaces, starting at the top. It may take several minutes for your soap scum to lift up, so have some patience and flex your muscles! It is helpful to start at the top so you don\u2019t have to clean your surfaces again after you wipe them down. Avoid using an abrasive scouring pad to prevent scratching the surface."
