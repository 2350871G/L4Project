Close the BBQ lid and let sit for a minute so that any smoke being generated by the BBQ may flavour the beans and potatoes and allow the thyme flavours to penetrate. Thyme and pepper burns rather easily so its best to add it after the BBQ has been turned off, so the remaining heat will keep the vegetables crispy, but not burn them. The optional extra olives or capers should be added with the thyme to allow them to warm through and the flavours mingle."
