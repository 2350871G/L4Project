The truth is, keeping a clear mind and sitting quietly is difficult for most of us. Here are some tips to get started:\nStart with short 3- to 5-minute sessions. If even that seems too long for you, try just a minute or two to start. Setting a timer on your phone can be helpful. Know what to expect from yourself. Don't expect your mind to be completely clear while meditating. It\u2019s more useful to work on catching yourself when your mind drifts. With time, you\u2019ll become quicker at catching your mind and setting it back on track. Meditate in your own way. If you struggle with sitting and doing nothing, try a walking meditation, where you focus your attention on the act of walking and the sensations that accompany it. You can also try a guided meditation, of which there are many videos and audio clips online."

Know that what people think of you may be more of a reflection of their own issues and insecurities than an accurate reflection of you. It\u2019s important to consider people\u2019s feelings, and respond to any concerns that they express about your behaviour. Ultimately, though, what matters most is how you view yourself. If you think people are judging your or talking about you, try to ignore them and focus on something else, like a fun conversation. People who do that at a party have so little to talk about, they focus on other people. How dull! This is easier said than done, but it will work wonders for your self-confidence and your ability to relax."

Telling yourself you\u2019ll only have fun when the conditions are perfect isn\u2019t very fun. In fact, it sets you up for never having fun, because life rarely goes the way we expect or want it to. Instead of being afraid of making a mistake, accept that you\u2019re afraid and tell yourself that you\u2019re going to make the most of the night, in spite of your fear. Instead of worrying about what might happen, make a goal to be positive and meet the night\u2019s challenges as they come.

Taking care of yourself, both mentally and physically, is the most important thing you can do to build your self-confidence. Ways to take care yourself physically (these effect your mental health as well): get enough sleep, drink enough water, eat healthfully, exercise regularly. Ways to take care of yourself mentally: meditate, think positively, and combat negative self talk (that voice in your head that calls you dumb, useless etc.) with positive statements about yourself. You might ask your friends or family to help you come up with a list of your good qualities. Feeling like you look good will help you feel more confident and enjoy the party.

Try not to force your body into this position, otherwise you\u2019ll look stiff. Avoid slouching, crossing your arms over your chest, or otherwise looking worried or unapproachable. When talking to people, keep your chin down and stand at a slight angle to them so that you\u2019re not facing them head on. This will make you seem more positive and non-judgemental."

If the person you\u2019re talking to begins talking about something you\u2019re also excited about, resist the urge to interrupt.

Here are a few ways that you can join a conversation:\nWalk up to a group but stay on the outskirts. Listen to what they\u2019re saying and then after a few minutes, contribute if you think it makes sense to do so. Only do this if you have something relevant to say. If you don\u2019t, move on to another group and try your luck there! Walk up and when there\u2019s a break in the conversation, introduce yourself to the group. Say a brief \u201cHello\u201d and your name, and then apologize for interrupting and ask them to go on with their conversation: \u201cHi I\u2019m John. I just wanted to introduce myself. Please go on with your conversation!\u201d\nTalk to a person on the outskirts of the group, and then turn your attention towards the whole group if appropriate. If the group wants to include you in their conversation, they\u2019ll smile and make room for you. If the group politely says hello but then returns to their conversation without making space for you, just move to another group or person. Try not to take it personally. They could be having a private conversation."

Even if you\u2019re working on stepping outside of your comfort zone, you can be honest about your basic likes, dislikes, and values. Example: If you don\u2019t like drinking or doing drugs, don\u2019t do them just to fit in. The same goes for anything else that you don\u2019t feel comfortable doing. Stepping outside your comfort zone is important, but you can do that with things that don\u2019t go against your personal values. Example: You\u2019re all dancing and a song you don\u2019t like comes on. Everyone is cheering and starts dancing harder. You can look at a friend or the person next to you and say while smiling, \u201cI actually kind of hate this song,\u201d then shrug and say \u201cbut I gotta dance\u201d and keep dancing."

You can also suggest an alternative game. Common games that make people feel uncomfortable include spin the bottle and seven minutes in heaven, which involve making out with others who you may not want to make out with. If you feel weird sitting on the sidelines and watching, go into the kitchen and clean up, or excuse yourself and go to another room until they\u2019re done. The same goes for drinking/drugs.

At some point the camera will go off, ideally when someone is holding it out in front of them.

Each person reads their card and guesses who it belongs to. Others are allowed to put in their guesses too. Do this until everyone has read their card.

Two statements should be true, and one should be a lie. Going around the room, each person says their three statements, then the group votes on which one is a lie, and the person who made up the statements reveals which was a lie.

You can really get into it by discussing your costumes and characters, including your back stories, with your friends. You can even make up fake names. You might even put on a fake accent and pretend to be from somewhere else. Avoid doing this at work-related parties or other parties where you might meet someone who you\u2019ll have to work with in real life.

Say a brief \u201cHello\u201d and your name, and then apologize for interrupting and ask them to go on with their conversation: \u201cHi I\u2019m John. I just wanted to introduce myself. Please go on with your conversation!\u201d\nTalk to a person on the outskirts of the group, and then turn your attention towards the whole group if appropriate. If the group wants to include you in their conversation, they\u2019ll smile and make room for you. If the group politely says hello but then returns to their conversation without making space for you, just move to another group or person. Try not to take it personally. They could be having a private conversation. Be yourself. It\u2019s important to always stay true to yourself in social situations. Even if you\u2019re working on stepping outside of your comfort zone, you can be honest about your basic likes, dislikes, and values. Example: If you don\u2019t like drinking or doing drugs, don\u2019t do them just to fit in. The same goes for anything else that you don\u2019t feel comfortable doing. Stepping outside your comfort zone is important, but you can do that with things that don\u2019t go against your personal values. Example: You\u2019re all dancing and a song you don\u2019t like comes on. Everyone is cheering and starts dancing harder. You can look at a friend or the person next to you and say while smiling, \u201cI actually kind of hate this song,\u201d then shrug and say \u201cbut I gotta dance\u201d and keep dancing. Help out the host. If you feel like you need a break from the festivities, ask the host if there\u2019s anything you can do to help out. The host will appreciate your help. The host may insist that you just have fun, but you can say it\u2019s okay you feel like you need a bit of a breather anyway, and would be happy to do dishes or set up a plate, or whatever else they may need done. Playing Party Games Bring some game ideas to the party. If things get slow, you can suggest some games to play. Make sure they\u2019re simple and quick to learn. If they\u2019re too complicated people will likely lose interest pretty quickly. Know that you don\u2019t have to play every game. If the party-goers decide on a game that you\u2019re uncomfortable with, it\u2019s okay to politely decline and do something else while they play the game. You can also suggest an alternative game. Common games that make people feel uncomfortable include spin the bottle and seven minutes in heaven, which involve making out with others who you may not want to make out with. If you feel weird sitting on the sidelines and watching, go into the kitchen and clean up, or excuse yourself and go to another room until they\u2019re done. The same goes for drinking/drugs. If you\u2019re not interested, just politely decline. Play sticker stalker. Bring a bunch of stickers to the party and ensure that everyone gets 1 sheet of stickers. The goal is to stick the stickers to other guests without them noticing. If someone notices you putting a sticker on them, you have to take it back, and they get to put one of their stickers on you. Whoever gets rid of all their stickers first wins. Play camera hot potato. For this game you\u2019ll need a point-and-shoot camera with a flash and self-timer. The instructions are as follows:\nSit on the floor in a circle. Set the self-timer on the camera and pass it around. Each player must quickly hold the camera out in front of them as if taking a selfie before passing it on to the next player. At some point the camera will go off, ideally when someone is holding it out in front of them. If you don\u2019t have a self-timing camera, you can also just have someone control the stereo, randomly stopping songs without looking at the group. Whenever the song stops, the person stuck with the camera must snap their selfie. Play likes and dislikes. This one is a great icebreaker that helps you get to know everyone at the party. How to play:\nPass out index cards and pens. Have everyone write out 5 likes on one side of the card, and 5 dislikes on the other side. Put the cards in a box and shake them up. Walk around the room and have everyone draw a card. Each person reads their card and guesses who it belongs to. Others are allowed to put in their guesses too. Do this until everyone has read their card. To make it a bit harder, don\u2019t reveal whose card is whose until everyone has finished guessing. Play the laughing game. Sit around a table or in an otherwise circular position where you can easily see and hear each other. Going around the circle, each player must say \u201cHa\u201d, \u201cHo\u201d, or \u201cHee\u201d without laughing. Whoever laughs is out of the game. Keep going around the circle until there\u2019s only one person left. You can make it even harder by setting the rule that everyone must keep a straight face \u2014 they can\u2019t even smile. Play two truths and a lie. This is another great way to get to know people. Here\u2019s how to play:\nSit in a circle. Tell each person to think of 3 things they will say about themselves. Two statements should be true, and one should be a lie. Going around the room, each person says their three statements, then the group votes on which one is a lie, and the person who made up the statements reveals which was a lie. Try to keep your truths and lies lighthearted, especially if you don't know anyone at the party very well. Make them interesting or funny, not too sad or serious. Play freeze dance. Everyone dances and one person controls the stereo. When the music stops, everyone has to freeze. Whoever is still moving the moment the music stops is out. Take turns controlling the stereo for this one, and be sure that whoever controlling the stereo isn\u2019t watching the group. Give yourself a goal that you must accomplish by the end of the night. This will help you break out of your shell, and even if you don\u2019t manage to do anything else that night, if you achieve that one goal, you can feel proud of yourself. For example, make a goal to ask at least 5 people you don't know how they know the host. Pretend to be someone else. You can play this game along, but it\u2019s more fun to play with friends. This game works best when a few of you are going to a party where no one knows you. You can really get into it by discussing your costumes and characters, including your back stories, with your friends. You can even make up fake names. You might even put on a fake accent and pretend to be from somewhere else. Avoid doing this at work-related parties or other parties where you might meet someone who you\u2019ll have to work with in real life. They might be weirded out or feel resentful toward you if they know you fooled them.",
