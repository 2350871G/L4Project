You can write \"No Other Tenants Besides [Your Name]\" on a sticky note in your mailbox or on your door.

          "description":"Sometimes writing \"Not at this address\" does not get the job done because of the automated system the postal service uses. The United States Postal Service prints a barcode on every piece of mail that corresponds to the address it is being delivered to. USPS uses these barcodes to sort the mail. Even if you have written a note on the envelope, the barcode will still allow the mail to come to your address. Mark through the barcode at the bottom of the envelope and write \"Not at this address\" on the mail. Marking out the barcode will cause the system to register the mail as \"undeliverable.\" Mail carriers receive mail in bundles for each individual address. The previous resident's mail could be in between pieces of mail that are actually for you."

Give your mail carrier some of the mail you have written \"Not at this address\" on. This may be more effective then simply writing a note on the piece of mail. Speaking with your mail carrier in person may encourage them to look into the matter and check and see if a change of address has been filed. When you go to the post office, ask to speak to the station manager and tell them your problem."
