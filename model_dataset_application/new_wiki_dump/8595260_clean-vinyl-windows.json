Use fresh, clean water to rinse off any loose particles and dirt from the surface by gently pouring water from a pitcher or wringing it out of a clean wet rag. Avoid wiping debris-covered windows without rinsing them first. To avoid scratching, you should also remove any rings, bracelets and watches you\u2019re wearing before you begin. These can puncture the vinyl. Avoid cleaning the glass in direct sunlight."
