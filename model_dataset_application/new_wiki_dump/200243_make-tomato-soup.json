  "text":" Peeling the Tomatoes Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Fill the pot about halfway with water, then place it on a burner over high heat and allow it to come to a full boil. Cut an \"x\" shape into the tomatoes. Use a sharp knife to cut an \"x\" on the tops or bottoms of the tomatoes. It's not necessary to cut too deep - just pierce the skin. This will make it easy to peel off the skin after the tomatoes have been blanched. Blanch the tomatoes. Drop a few tomatoes into the boiling water. Let them blanch for about 30 seconds.

Blanching loosens their skins, but leaving them in the pot for more than 30 seconds will cause them to actually start cooking, which will make them lose their flavor.

Take a cooled tomato and insert your finger under the skin where you cut the \"x.\" Pull on the skin to peel it away in large strips. Continue until all the skin has been removed. Repeat with the remaining tomatoes, and discard the skin. Roasting the Vegetables Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Cut the vegetables into large slices. Cut up the peeled tomatoes, the bell pepper, and the onion. There's no need to make the slices even or bite-sized, since they will be pureed at a later stage. If you wish to seed your tomatoes as well, now is the time. Toss the vegetables with oil. Place the cut vegetables into a large bowl. Add the garlic and the sprigs of thyme. Pour the oil over the vegetables and use two large spoons to toss the ingredients together until all of the vegetables are coated in a thin layer of oil. Place the vegetables on a baking sheet. Spread them evenly so that each piece is touching the baking sheet, which will ensure that they each caramelize a bit. Arrange the thyme sprigs evenly around the vegetables. Roast the vegetables for 30 minutes. Place the baking sheet in the oven and let the vegetables cook. The tomatoes will release a fair amount of juice, which you might hear boiling over the rim of the baking sheet and sizzling in the oven. Let the vegetables keep cooking until the onions are slightly brown on top. Combining the Vegetables and Stock Transfer the roasted vegetables into a large stockpot. Use a spatula to help you scoop the tomatoes, peppers, onions, garlic and thyme into the pot. Transfer all the juices, too. Add the stock. Pour the quart of chicken or vegetable stock over the vegetables. If you like thicker tomato soup, you can scale back the stock by 1/2 cup. For thinner soup, add 1/2 cup water to the stock. Season the soup and let it simmer. Taste the soup and add a pinch of salt and pepper. Place the pot on a burner and turn the heat to medium. Let the flavors simmer together for 30 minutes. Taste the soup again and adjust the seasonings if necessary. Finishing the Soup Puree the soup. Working in small batches, transfer the soup to a blender. Puree it until it's smooth in consistency.
