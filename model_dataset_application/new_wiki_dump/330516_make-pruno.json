But at home, you can also make your own version of pruno using all the convenient equipment and ingredients available in a modern kitchen. To make artisan pruno at home, you'll need:\nImmersion blender\nWooden spoon\nLarge saucepan\nSmall bowl\nOne-gallon (3.8-L) sealable plastic bag\nClean bath towel\nHeating pad\nStrainer\nCheesecloth\nLarge bowl\nFunnel\nLarge sterile bottle or jar with lid"

Use the immersion blender to puree the fruit until it\u2019s juicy and pulpy, but still has some bite-sized chunks in it. Make sure to move the immersion blender around in the bowl as you blend, to ensure the fruit is pureed evenly."

        {
          "headline":"Boil the fruit, sugar, and water.",
          "description":"When the fruit is ready, add the 1 cup (225 g) of sugar and 2 cups (474 ml) of the water and stir to combine. Put on the lid, transfer the fruit mixture to the stove, and bring it to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently to prevent burning. Once the fruit comes to a boil, let it simmer for 30 minutes to kill any bacteria that may be present. Continue stirring the mixture regularly."

          "headline":"Cool the fruit.",
          "description":"After the fruit boils for 30 minutes, remove it from the heat and let it cool. You don\u2019t want it completely cold, but slightly above room temperature to help the yeast flourish. As the fruit cools, continue stirring from time to time so it cools evenly. The cooling process will take about 30 minutes to an hour."

          "headline":"Activate the yeast.",
          "description":"Combine the yeast, the 1 cup of warm water, and the 3 teaspoons of sugar in a bowl. Set the bowl aside for five to 10 minutes to let it activate. As the yeast comes to life, it will begin to froth and bubble in the bowl."

Transfer the fruit, towel, and heating pad to a dark place, such as a closet. If you don\u2019t have an electric heating pad, fill a hot water bottle with warm water. Be sure to check on the water ever six to 12 hours, and add fresh warm water as necessary when the bottle starts to get cold. The reason you have to keep the fruit mixture warm is so the yeast will stay alive to ferment the fruit and turn it to alcohol."

          "headline":"Burp the bag daily.",
          "description":"As the yeast converts the sugars in the bag to alcohol and carbon dioxide, the bag will slowly fill up with gas. To prevent it from bursting, remove the bag from the towel once or twice a day and open the bag to release the gas and pressure. Reseal the bag, wrap it back in the towel, and return it to its dark spot on the heating pad. When the mixture stops bloating, it means the yeast has converted all the sugar to alcohol and carbon dioxide, meaning the pruno is ready. This will take about five days."

          "headline":"Strain the pruno.",
          "description":"When the mixture has stopped bloating, it\u2019s ready to strain. Place a cheesecloth-lined strainer over a bowl. Pour the fruit mixture into the strainer and let the juice drain down into the bowl. To get the most juice out, wring out the cheesecloth with the fruit still inside."

          "description":"Place the funnel inside the neck of a sterile glass jar or bottle. Pour the pruno into the bottle. Transfer the bottle to the fridge and allow it to chill for several hours or overnight. A large mason jar will work to store your pruno, or a large two-liter pop bottle."
