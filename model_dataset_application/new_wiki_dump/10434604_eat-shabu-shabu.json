Hard vegetables like carrots, bok choy, broccoli, mushrooms, and peas will take around 3-5 minutes to cook, while leafy vegetables will cook faster.

After swishing the piece of meat through the broth for 10 seconds, lift it out of the pot and let the excess broth drip off. You may be a little worried about your meat cooking all the way through if it\u2019s your first time eating shabu shabu. That\u2019s normal, but still try to avoid leaving it in the broth for too long or dumping all of it in the broth at the beginning of your meal.

Depending on your preference, you may want to cook your dumplings for longer than 5 minutes (you may be able to cook them for as long as 9 minutes).
