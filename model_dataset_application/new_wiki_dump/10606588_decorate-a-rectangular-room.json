If you block out unsightly angular corners you can create a better sense of depth to the room.

Instead, opt for smaller single sofas placed in corners or directly in the middle of the room. Having smaller pieces of furniture rather than long, large ones will keep the floor space clear and make the room feel less narrow."

Plan out where you want people to walk ahead of time, and place furniture and accessories with that path in mind. Placing couches in the corners is perfect for a diagonal walkway, for example, while having sofas arranged in the middle of the room works well for a walkway on the edge of the room."

Each space should be about half of the room's length and be able to comfortably fit the essentials of each room. When the room has been split in two, design each area as if it were its own room while allowing for some blending. For example, a dining area and a living room combination will need to have a separate dining table and TV area, but wall decorations and cabinets are suited for both types of room. Try not to make the rooms clash in terms of walking flow. Keep in mind walkways for your guests, and make it as easy as possible to get from one area to the other without obstacles."
