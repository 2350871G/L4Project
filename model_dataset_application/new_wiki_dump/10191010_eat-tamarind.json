Holding the tamarind pod in both hands, bend it until it snaps, splitting to reveal the pulp and seeds inside. If the pods are tough, you can soak them in hot water to soften them before you peel them. You can find tamarind pods at some Asian supermarkets, or you can buy them dried online. Store tamarind pods in a cool, dark place, like the back of a cabinet, where they\u2019ll keep indefinitely."

          "description":"The flesh of the tamarind is tart. It\u2019s more sour when the fruit is slightly unripe and becomes sweeter as the pod ages. Nibble the flesh from around the seeds, much like when you\u2019re eating a cherry or a grape with seeds that you don\u2019t want to chew. Keep damp paper towels nearby, since eating tamarind this way can be sticky."

          "description":"Use your fingers to break the pulp into large pieces. You can either use tamarind concentrate or the pulp from raw tamarind pods. There is no need to de-seed the tamarind pods first, nor to remove any seeds that might be contained in the tamarind concentrate. The pulp fibers are attached tightly to the seeds, so it's easier to remove the seeds after you mix hot water into the pulp later in the process. Although most seeds are removed from tamarind concentrate, it\u2019s common to find a few, especially in rustic preparations."

The boiling water will help dissolve the tamarind pulp, allowing the baking soda, salt, and tamarind to combine. As you stir, the water will be absorbed. Once it's fully absorbed, the tamarind mixture should resemble a thick paste."

Take your time removing the seeds to make sure no one bites down on one while enjoying your tamarind candy. Either wait until the tamarind has cooled, or use a fork or other utensil so you don\u2019t burn yourself."

Add the sugar, then stir the mixture until the sugar is completely blended into the rest of the ingredients. If you want a sweet and spicy treat, add in 1/2 tsp (2.6 g) of hot chili powder, such as habanero. However, this is optional. Once you stir in the sugar, the tamarind mixture should be somewhat grainy but still sticky."

If you need to add more sugar, add it in 1/8 cup (25 g) increments until you reach the desired texture."
