      "headline":"Be hygienic.",
      "description":"Take a shower, even if it's a quick three-minute navy shower. Wash and dry off your hands and face well, dry and comb your hair, and wear comfortable clothing! It makes a big difference. Another good tip to get your reflexes nice and jittery is to wash with some sort of mint body wash. Mint leaves a nice cooling sensation on the body, which generally leads to good comfort. Avoid having greasy hands by any and all means. This may become difficult if your hands are moisturized; in that case, go and do something else until they feel wet without actually looking wet. Dry off with a hand towel, and see if they are still greasy. If they are, just wait it off-maybe go to GameFAQs [1] to get/give some help! {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/3\\/31\\/Become-a-More-Focused-Gamer-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Become-a-More-Focused-Gamer-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/3\\/31\\/Become-a-More-Focused-Gamer-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\\/aid297256-v4-728px-Become-a-More-Focused-Gamer-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"
