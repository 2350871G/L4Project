      "description":"First, do a smell test. Smell along the indentations of the durian where the durian seeds are nearest. If the smell is strong, it's ripe. If it smells raw, that means it\u2019s unripe. Some unscrupulous dealers will try to unload unripe ones to you. It happens when winds or heavy rain are so strong that it causes the durians to fall even when they are not yet ripe. There is no point in buying an unripe durian because it does not have any taste at all."

      "description":"You may want to wear gloves or hold two pieces of cloths to protect your hands for this one. Give the durian a sudden jerk. There should be a slight knock if it\u2019s just right. If there is no knock, then it\u2019s probably overripe and if it\u2019s very shaky, then it\u2019s not ripe at all."

      "description":"It could mean that the durian is ripe but has been attacked by parasites or eaten by squirrels. If you do not want to share your durian with parasites, or buy it half eaten, check for holes on the shell. One thing to note is that if a durian is attacked by parasites, it would also mean that the plantation does not use any pesticides which could be better for health."
