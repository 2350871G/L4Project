Other flavors and spices provide a more subtle taste. Know the general strengths of ingredients to build the right flavor profile. Things like meat, mushrooms, and beans provide what are known as low notes. They are the subtle flavors lingering under other tastes in a dish. Mid notes are very subtle flavors. While they help inform the taste of a dish, they are not immediately noticeable. Things like raw vegetables and chicken provide mid notes. High notes define the flavor of a dish.

Vegetables, meats, and soups can all be cooked with a savory profile. Ingredients that round out savory profiles are things like salt, hard cheeses, and fish pastes. High notes are things like soy sauce, miso, seaweed, fish sauce, and pickled vegetables. Low notes are things like cured meats, such as bacon, tomatoes, and mushrooms."

Opt for the right mix of flavors to create a sweet profile. Honey, jam, sugar, and maple syrup are used to round out a sweet flavor profile. Low and mid-notes for a sweet profile include mostly vegetables. Things like sweet potatoes, corn, carrots, and squash work here. Most fruit can also be used to provide low or mid notes for a sweet profile. For your high notes, molasses, ketchup, and barbecue sauce can be used.

For example, sweet and sour chicken helps blend the sweet sauce with the savory chicken. Round out a sour flavor profile with ingredients like lemon, lime, or orange juice. You can also use vinegars such as sherry, red, rice, balsamic, and apple cider vinegar. Tomatoes can provide mid or high notes for a sour profile. For high notes, try ingredients like tomato paste, yogurt, sour cream, and pickled vegetables."

Bitter flavors may also be used in desserts, dips, or side dishes. Bitter flavors generally do not have a mix of high or low notes and are only tossed in to balance out other flavors. Things like coffee, cocoa powder, grapefruit juice, or beer create a bitter flavor. Green vegetables, like kale, spinach, and broccoli also provide a touch of bitterness."
