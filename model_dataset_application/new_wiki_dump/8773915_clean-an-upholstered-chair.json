Raymond Chiu\t\t\tCleaning Guru & Director of Operations, Maid Sailors\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: White vinegar is an excellent option for cleaning most types of upholstery. Add two parts warm water and one part white vinegar to a spray bottle, then shake the bottle well to make sure everything's mixed. Then, spray the mixture onto the upholstery and use a soft rag or brush to scrub the area gently in a circular motion. If the upholstery is leather, mix the vinegar with olive oil instead of water, then spray the surface and buff it with a soft cloth."

To speed up the process and ensure everything is dry, keep all cushions separate while they dry. Also keep any non-upholstered parts of the chair dry while you clean with any liquid. This will prevent rusting, corrosion, or warping of metal or wood parts."
