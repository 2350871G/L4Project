Apply honing oil to your sharpening stone with your finger or a soft toothbrush in small, circular motions. Continue rubbing until you see metal flecks rise up from the pores of the stone. Honing oil can also be used to provide lubrication during the sharpening process. Purchase honing oil in hardware stores or online.
