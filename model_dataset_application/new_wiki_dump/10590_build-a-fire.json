Having ready-to-use firewood will spare you the time, effort, and uncertainty of searching for usable firewood in the woods. Pre-cut wood logs can be purchased at hardware stores, or from merchants near campsites.

  "text":" Gathering What You Need Buy pre-cut firewood to play it safe, if possible. Pre-cut firewood is the ideal option for making a fire at home, and it is also a wise bet for starting a fire outdoors.

Pre-cut wood logs can be purchased at hardware stores, or from merchants near campsites.

These logs have the benefit of lighting without any starting material and leaving little mess, but they do not create the same heat as a regular, wood-burning fire would. To make an easy fire when you are not in need of warmth, purchase manufactured logs at hardware stores. Find small, dry materials to use as tinder for a natural fire. Tinder is easy-to-light materials that help to start your fire. Find small, dry items such as grass, leaves, shredded tree bark or newspaper are ideal choices. In a pinch, tortilla chips make great tinder if you are willing to spare the snack. Tip: Some stores sell pre-made tinder. you can also make your own tinder ahead of time.
