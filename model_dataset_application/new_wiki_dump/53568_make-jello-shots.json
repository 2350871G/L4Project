Even though they'll set in a few hours, the extra time chilling helps them firm up even more so that they don't fall apart when you cut them. Cut orange halves into thirds.

Before pouring the Jello into the cups, add green and/or blue food coloring to make the Jello green. You can make multiple batches with varying shades of green if you want! Serve.
