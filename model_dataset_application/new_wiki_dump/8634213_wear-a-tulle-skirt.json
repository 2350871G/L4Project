          "description":"Pink and white are common colors for tulle skirts, so you can always go for one of these colors if you want to create a soft, classic tulle skirt look. However, choosing a bold color can set your tulle skirt look apart from the rest. It can add interest and change your whole look. For example, you can try wearing a black, purple, red, or dark blue tulle skirt for something more dramatic. Or, go for a fun take on the tulle skirt look with a neon colored tulle skirt, such as lime green, hot pink, or tangerine."

          "headline":"Consider the length.",
          "description":"You can find tulle skirts in a variety of different lengths, and the length can change your whole look. For a casual look, go for a shorter length like just above the knee or mid-calf length. For a more formal look, go for a floor length maxi skirt. Keep in mind that no matter what length you choose, you can dress it up or down depending on your needs."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Experiment with fullness.",
          "description":"Tulle skirts vary in fullness as well. You can find an extra full tulle skirt, or find one that is more subdued. Try out a few different levels of fullness to see which one looks best on you. Tulle skirts are flattering on just about anyone because they flare out at the hip. Therefore, they make the waist seem smaller and produce an attractive A-line effect. However, a skirt with less fullness may not give the same effect as one that is full."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Try out different styles.",
          "description":"Some tulle skirts are layered and simple, while other tulle skirts may have other details, such as tiers, pleating, a ruffled hem, or a cloth underlay. Try out different styles to see what you like and what works best for your body type. Pay attention to the waistband as well. Some tulle skirts have wide waistbands, while others have very slim or even nonexistent waistbands. A thicker waistband may define your waist more, while a slim waistband provides a more subtle definition. If you'd like to maximize your options, you can also make your own tulle skirt and choose the exact color, length, and style you want."

          "description":"Tulle skirts are the height of feminine fashion, so why not go all the way with it? By choosing a top that is fitted, you will be balancing out the look and enhancing your feminine curves. Try pairing your tulle skirt with a soft, form-fitting scoop neck sweater or a delicate fitted blouse. Look for tops with feminine cuts as well. For example, you could choose a top that reveals a bit of your chest, shoulders, or back."

For example, you can look for a tank top with lace around the neckline, a long sleeved top made entirely of lace material, or a blouse that has a wide strip of lace down the front."

Try wearing your tulle skirt with a plaid flannel shirt or a plain white button down shirt to get this contrasting effect. Other ways to add a masculine touch to your tulle skirt look is to wear a denim shirt or a band t-shirt. Both of these tops will contrast with the feminine, fluffy skirt in a fun way."

          "headline":"Keep it simple.",
          "description":"Pairing your tulle shirt with a simple top can tone down a tulle skirt for casual daytime activities, and make it easier to transition your look from day to night. Try wearing your tulle skirt with a plain white t-shirt, band t-shirt, or a solid tank top for a toned down daytime look. Carry a cardigan, shrug, or shawl that you can slip on later in the day to transition your tulle skirt look from day to night. Make your look more glamorous with some decadent jewelry, like a pearl necklace, so diamond (faux or real) studs, or some gold bangles."

Try pairing your tulle skirt with a sweater in cold weather for a glamorous winter outfit. Different length coats and jackets pair well with tulle skirts as well.

For example, you could try wearing a pearl necklace or a pair of pearl earrings. Other great feminine jewelry options include statement necklaces, bow shaped earrings, and anything pink.

To build more contrast into your look, try wearing a pair of sneakers or combat boots with your tulle skirt. If you want to bring out your inner ballerina even more, then wear a pair of ballet flats.
