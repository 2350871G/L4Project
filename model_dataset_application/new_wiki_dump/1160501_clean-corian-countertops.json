Since Corian countertops are nonporous, the spill won't soak in, making it a breeze to just wipe it up with a clean, damp cloth. Always dry the surface immediately after cleaning. If you don't dry the surface, film will build up over time."

Make sure to rinse it with clean water, and don't forget to dry it so you don't leave streaks. Don't use window cleaners on this type of counter, as these can leave a waxy buildup. Before using any cleaner, read the directions on the bottle. Always test the cleaner first on an out-of-way corner, so you can rest assured it won't create a different problem. Although glass cleaner does have ammonia in it, you should skip it for this purpose. It can leave a film on the countertop. Pick a household cleaner instead."

Spray the cleaner on the counter, and use a clean, wet rag to rub the cleaner in. You can leave the cleaner on for a minute or two to help remove the stain.

The best tools are the abrasive pads put out by DuPont, which get progressively finer. However, you can also try something like Comet powder cleaner and a Scotch-Brite white pad. Fine-grit sandpaper may also work. It will need to be 400-grit wet-dry sandpaper. With the DuPont abrasive pads or sandpaper, clean the counter to remove any film, and leave it wet. Starting with the peach pad (or sandpaper), rub lightly in one direction over the scratch. Every once and a while, switch the direction you're rubbing perpendicularly. Run the pad under water to remove residue as you go. Keep scrubbing until the scratch is removed. You may need to work over a large surface area or use finer abrasive pads to help it blend. With a Scotch-Brite pad, start with a clean, wet counter. Sprinkle on some Comet, and rub the scratch in circles. Next, move on to rubbing it the direction the scratch is going. Once again, you may need to work in a large area to blend in what you're sanding. For deeper scratches, you're going to need professional help."
