You can construct homemade containers using fence posts and either wire mesh siding or lattice. The container should be square or round and have an open bottom. Professional compost containers come in two forms:\nCompost bins, large containers that look similar to trash cans. These are small and cheap, but open at the bottom, making it difficult to turn compost. Compost tumblers, rotating cylinders that, though expensive, are easy to turn and incredibly effective."

Examples of proper materials include:\nGreen items like fruit peels and pulp, vegetable peels and pulp, tea leaves and bags, coffee grounds, and carrot tops.
