          "description":"Leather stretches out naturally when it\u2019s being used, so by simply wearing your leather pants, jacket, or skirt around the house, it will begin to stretch.

          "description":"If you have a wallet, coin purse, bag, or other accessory that needs stretching, try stuffing it. Use a material such as paper or cloth, making sure the material won\u2019t damage the leather by being too rough. Fill your leather accessory with the material so that it\u2019s as full as you would like. How long you let the item stretch will depend on its size and your personal preference. This method will work even better if you get the material slightly wet before stuffing the leather. Apply a leather stretching spray before stuffing the leather for it to stretch out even faster. These sprays can be found at a shoe or big-box store, as well as online."
