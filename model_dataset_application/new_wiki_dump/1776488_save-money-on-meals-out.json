          "description":"These days, many restaurants use social media platforms to advertise discounts and special offers to entice more customers to frequent their establishments. It could be a set menu or an offer for certain days of the week, but you might end up paying a whole lot less for your meal, or you might get an extra course or drinks thrown in. Try social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Scoutmob, etc. Many people use Yelp to read reviews of businesses, but you can also find deals on there as well. The restaurant may offer a deal if you \"check in\" on Yelp or similar app. When checking out the social media platforms, make sure you sign up for updates from your favorite restaurants (or any categories of restaurants you\u2019re interested in). Once you sign up for several of these platform notifications, you should have a steady stream of deals coming in on a regular basis. You may also find online deals on a restaurant\u2019s individual webpage. You can also try online discount sites like Groupon or Livingsocial."

You can find offers like \u201cbuy one get one free\u201d or a percentage off of your meal. All of these offers will help you save a few bucks when dining out. Usually local newspapers are the best for finding usable coupons for eating out, rather than national newspapers. You might consider buying several of the newspapers to stock up on coupons since newspapers are relatively inexpensive. The extra cost for the papers could be countered by the amount you\u2019ll save with the coupons. You could also ask your friends and neighbors to give you their newspapers after they finish reading them. Then you could get the coupons for free."

Lunch can often be a slower time for restaurants so they\u2019re happy to drop their prices to fill the tables.

Lots of restaurants let you bring your own these days, so take them up on their offer. You usually have to pay a few dollars\u2019 corkage fee but this will be a fraction of the price of a bottle of wine in a restaurant. Bring your own also means you get to choose a wine that you know you\u2019ll like, rather than picking from a menu of wines that you have never tried. Make sure you approve this with the restaurant ahead of time because not all restaurants allow you to bring your own. It could be embarrassing if you bring your own wine to a place that doesn\u2019t have a BYOB policy in place."

When you opt to forego eating in the restaurant, this leaves the tables open for other paying customers, so the restaurant can make more money. This also means that you can save even more money by buying drinks at home instead of at the restaurant. You can try calling around to see what restaurants offer these kinds of discounts. This also means you save on a tip, since you won't have a server (you may still want to leave a small tip to be passed on to those in the kitchen, however)."

It could be a two-course set meal or a limited choice from the a la carte menu, but if you like what you see then you can duck inside and save a fortune. Some of these daily deals include a glass of wine or even a half bottle of wine with each meal ordered so you really can grab a bargain. This can be a great way of discovering a new restaurant or trying out a place that is usually too pricey for your modest budget."
