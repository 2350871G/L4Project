The symbol can be the Arabic word for halal, or the halal logo. If you\u2019re not sure whether or not the meat is halal, ask the butcher or a store associate.

Refrain from purchasing pork or products made from pork, like ham, bacon, or lard if you're planning to make a halal meal. If a butcher or sales associate claims that a pork product is halal, do not purchase from them. This can be a sign that they don\u2019t fully know the guidelines for preparing and storing halal meat, which can lead to contamination."

Once you have those gloves on, touch only foods that are considered halal. If you do touch a non-halal food item, simply change your gloves again before you touch halal food."

Remember to keep the cutting board and knife clean by washing them with hot, soapy water after each use. If you\u2019re not sure if the cutting board or knife have been used for preparing non-halal meat, thoroughly wash the board and knife with hot, soapy water."

Once you cook the halal meat, use the same pan or fryer to cook non-halal meat without contamination. This is one of the simplest methods for preventing contamination in the kitchen, and it doesn\u2019t require you to wash the pan or change the oil of the fryer after cooking."

If you have to prepare a lot of halal meat at once, clean the grill thoroughly using hot, soapy water, and utilize the entire grill for halal meat. Once the halal meat is cooked and removed from the grill, you can cook the non-halal meat on the grill without cleaning it."

For a white wine substitute, use sweet white grape juice instead. For a red wine substitute, use grape juice or vegetable stock. To substitute beer in a recipe, use ginger ale."
