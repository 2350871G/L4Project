          "description":"Some power outages are planned well in advance, but others are the result of an emergency situation, such as flood or tornado. Before you lose power, sit down with your family and write down what each family member will do in case of an outage. Give each person specific responsibilities, such as gathering flashlights, and discuss how you all will communicate in case the internet or landlines go down. Give these documents to extended family members and friends as well. This will help them to know where to find you and how to contact you in the event of an emergency. Go through as many different scenarios as possible when creating this document. For example, talk about what you will do if it is unsafe to drive due to downed power lines in your area. Some organizations, like the Red Cross, have downloadable templates available online that you can use to start the process of creating your own customized plan."

This list should include numbers for the power company, the local fire department, hospital, personal doctor, and other emergency agencies."

          "description":"Go online to the website for your local government disaster agency, like FEMA branches, and see if they offer text or email alerts for power outages or other emergencies. This is a great, free way to give yourself a few extra minutes of preparation time prior to an actual outage. Also, go ahead and sign up for any notifications offered by your power company. Then you will know if they have any planned outages coming up for your area."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Talk with your power company about what to expect.",
          "description":"Before an outage occurs, call your power company and discuss with them what their protocol is in the event of a residential power loss. Ask them how they will contact you and how they go about determining which areas to service first. This may seem like a hassle, but it will be great information to have in the event of an outage. Power companies recognize that some people rely on electricity to keep critical medical devices up and running. If this is the case for you, alert your company and they will put you on a priority service list."

          "description":"If your outage is weather-related, then you will want to keep a close eye on developing conditions. Cell service may be unreliable during these situations, so a battery or hand-crank radio is your best option. This may seem an antiquated way of getting information, but it actually works really well in storm situations. Many emergency agencies, such as the Red Cross, sell weather radios online."

When your phone is charged, keep your phone calls short to further conserve the battery and not tie up networks."

A car charger, for example, can help keep your cell phone powered up. Additional batteries can help keep your flashlights going. If you use a wheelchair or other assistance device, talk to the manufacturer about what non-electric charging options are available."

Keeping copies of these items on a portable drive or Cloud location makes it possible to access them anywhere. These extra copies can also keep your information safe in the event that a power surge does damage your laptop or other devices."

Some generators tie directly into the home power source, whereas others are portable, but provide less overall power. Operating a generator safely is extremely important, as they can put off toxic fumes if not properly ventilated or installed. If you plan to use a generator, go ahead and install carbon monoxide alarms in all rooms and gathering spaces of your home."

It may look like a plastic handle attached at the end of a rope towards the back of your garage or a metal slide-lever to the side of the doors. Practice lifting this release lever to manually raise your garage door without using electricity. If there are downed power lines in the street, it is generally not safe to drive and it may be better to keep your car in the garage protected."

Refrigerators will generally keep their contents cool for up to four hours and a freezer will keep food safe to consume for up to 48 hours if fully stocked, 24 hours if only half-full. Filling your freezer up with ice is a great way to keep the temp down and preserve food longer. Either purchase ice bags or store plastic water-filled containers until they freeze.
