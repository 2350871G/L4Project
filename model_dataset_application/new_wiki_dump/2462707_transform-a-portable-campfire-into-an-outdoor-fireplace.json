  "text":" Preparing the Campfire Container (Burner) Measure your portable propane campfire before shopping for a suitable garden container. The campfire will need to fit inside the container. Consider purchasing a set of roller wheels for the container so that you can move it around your backyard or patio. The garden container must be non-flammable and wide enough for containing the campfire and flames. A large terracotta pot is ideal, glazed or unglazed. Do not use anything plastic. Drill a hole in the chosen container for the propane hose to run through. Before drilling, pour some water in the bottom of the container in the location you will be drilling. The water will provide lubrication when drilling. Note: tap water is good enough, imported or bottled water is not necessary. Drill the hole through the side of the pot, about 1\u201d (2.5cm) up from the bottom. Note: Hold the drill with both hands when starting to drill, as the drill bit will have a tendency to move around until the hole has been started. Making the Burner Support Measure the burner support. To determine the height of the burner support, measure the depth of the garden container and subtract in inches (centimeters) the height of the portable propane campfire bowl. This will give you the height of the burner support needed. Measure the flat portion of the bottom of your garden container. Note: A 2x4 is 3 1\u20442\u2019\u2019x 1 1\u20442\u2019\u2019. You can also use 1x4 for smaller height adjustments, which are also not 1\u2019\u2019x 4\u2019\u2019. Measure and cut as many part (A) pieces of 2x4 as you will require to raise your campfire to its desired height.  Place one piece of (A) 2x4 on top of another piece of (A) and measure the distance from inside edge of top piece to end of bottom piece. Divide this number by 2 that will give you the proper length for part (B). Measure and cut as many part (B) pieces of 2x4 as you will require to raise the campfire to the proper height. You will require 2 part (B) pieces for every layer. Stack the (A) and (B) parts. Repeat as required to build the support up to the proper level. Your campfire support is now done! Pulling it All Together Remove and reconnect the propane hose to the burner base. Note: Use a wrench to remove and connect the hose at the burner base. Disconnect the propane hose from the burner base.  Insert the hose through the hole extending it far enough that you can reattach it to the burner base outside the container.  Turn the gas on and check for leaks.  Reassemble the burner base support in the bottom of the container.  Lower the burner base onto the burner support while pulling the extra propane hose back out of the container.  Sit back and relax. Enjoy your new backyard fireplace!",
