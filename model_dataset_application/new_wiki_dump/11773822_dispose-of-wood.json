You could contact local waste disposal services to see if they will accept larger branches. Most yard waste, including twigs, branches, and firewood, can be disposed of through these services. The rules for disposing of yard waste vary from place to place. Contact your local waste management service for more information. Your local government\u2019s waste management office can also help. If you have a long piece of wood that would be too long for regular disposal, try cutting it down to size."
