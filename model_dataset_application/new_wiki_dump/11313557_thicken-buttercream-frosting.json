This is especially important if you\u2019re working in a warm kitchen. Check the frosting after 30 minutes to see if it has thickened by sticking a spoon in it and stirring it around.

Add the cornstarch 0.5  tsp (2.5 ml) at a time, mixing it in thoroughly with a mixer or whisk until the frosting starts to thicken. Avoid adding more than 1 US tbsp (15 ml) of cornstarch to the buttercream frosting, or the frosting will have a starchy flavor."

Use a mixer or spoon to combine the added butter to the frosting until it starts to thicken. Melting the butter too much before pouring it into the frosting will mess up the frosting\u2019s consistency. If your butter has turned into a liquid, it's too melted. Press down on the stick of butter using a spoon. If the spoon moves through the butter easily, it's ready to go into the frosting."
