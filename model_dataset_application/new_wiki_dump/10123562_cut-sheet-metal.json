          "description":"Metal is difficult for saws to cut, and rubbing wax along the blade helps prolong its sharpness. Apply a thin layer of paraffin or saw wax to the blade, just enough to cover the surface, before making any cuts in the metal. Put on a pair of work gloves before you wax the saw to protect your hands. Choose a saw with a tooth number of at least 24tip (teeth per inch) to ensure even cuts in the metal."

          "headline":"Tape the sheet metal and secure it in place.",
          "description":"Apply masking tape to both sides of the sheet metal directly over the line you want to make. This ensures a cleaner cut and prevents metal chips from scratching the sheet while you cut. Clamp the sheet metal against your desk to hold it in place while you work. Electric saws are best for making straight cuts only. If you need to make a curved cut, try tin snips, a dremel, or a metal nibbler instead."

          "description":"Position the saw blade against the metal's edge so the teeth point forward. If you're not sure where the teeth are pointed, run your finger carefully against the blade. The teeth should lightly touch or \"grip\" your finger if they point in the right direction. If the teeth are dull and you can't feel them no matter how you touch the blade, replace the blade first. Before making the first cut, put on a pair of safety goggles, a respirator, and earplugs for protection."

          "description":"Grip the saw with both hands and push the blade forward with your dominant hand. Push slowly, especially if you're unfamiliar with electric saws, to prevent injuries or an uneven cut. Do not use your non-dominant hand to push. It should only be used to steady the blade and guide its direction."

          "description":"Push your saw through the blade until you reach the end of the line. After finishing the first stroke, pull the saw back with your dominant hand and remove it from the metal sheet. One stroke should be enough to cut through the metal. If not, repeat the process by following the first cut you made with your saw. Don't put any pressure on the saw during the return stroke, as this can wear out the blade."
