Generally, leafy herbs will spoil more quickly, compared to heartier herbs, which can be stored more easily. Leafy herbs include basil, cilantro, parsley, and mint, and should be stored in water in the fridge. Hearty herbs include sage, rosemary, thyme, and dill. These herbs should be bundled loosely and stored in the fridge, wrapped loosely in paper towel, but not in water.

Chef Alex Hong, who's worked in the restaurant industry for over 10 years, says: \"It's nice to have some sort of fresh herb so you can add something green and vibrant into whatever you're making. I recommend keeping rosemary, thyme, and sage on hand. Parsley and tarragon are great, too.\""

          "description":"Whether you've bought your herbs in a bunch at the market, or purchased them fresh in a plastic container, it's a good idea to remove the binding and examine them. Remove any wilting, spotted, or slimy stalks, and trim the end of all of the stems. Dry them thoroughly. Leafy herbs will spoil much more quickly if they're wet. You don't have to trim much, just the very end of the stems. No more than a centimeter or two. Do not remove the leaves from the stems. If you want to dry or freeze your herbs, skip to the next section."

Put about 1-2 inches of clean filtered water at the bottom of a drinking glass and let your herbs sit with the cut stems submerged. Keep them unbridled and loose. Don't submerge the leaves in water. Just the ends of the stems. Think flowers."

          "description":"Use a loose, open paper towel wrapped around the top of the leaves, and tucked into the glass. This helps to keep the moisture around the herbs, without trapping it against the leaves. It also helps keep the herbs from taking on the smells of your refrigerator. If you don't have a paper towel, a plastic bag can work just as well. These tend to trap moisture against the leaves, making them spoil more quickly, but they can work just fine."

Change out the water every couple of days, and make sure they're not wilting or spoiling. Remove individual leaves as you use the herbs, or remove whole bunches you plan to use and discard the stems. Remove spoiled leaves you find, to keep the rest of the bunch from following suit."

          "description":"When you get your herbs home from the store, dry them as if you were going to store them freshly. Rinse them, if necessary, dry them thoroughly, and trim the stem ends of the herbs. Gather them in bunches and let dry for at least a week. Different herbs will dry at different rates. Gather the herbs in loose bundles, tying the stems together with rubber bands, twine, or old twist-ties. Hang the herbs upside down in a cool dry place in your house, so the air circulates around them thoroughly. You can also store your bunches in dry paper bags, which helps to collect falling dried leaves and seeds that can fall. Some people like the way it looks to have herb bunches hanging around the house, though. Herbs are done when they're crunchy and dry and no longer have any moisture in the leaves."

          "headline":"Dry herbs in the oven at very low temperature.",
          "description":"The fastest way to dry herbs is in the oven. Generally, you'll get more flavor and life out of herbs if you dry them more slowly or freeze them, but this is a method to use quickly if need be. For broad-leaf herbs, like basil, arrange picked leaves across a baking sheet and bake at extremely low temperature, the lowest that your oven will go. For herbs with tiny leaves, like rosemary, you can typically leave them on the stem. Turn the leaves frequently to make sure they don't burn, and the herbs should be thoroughly dried in an hour or so. Depending on the herbs and the temperature of your oven, the herbs can burn very quickly, or dry very slowly over a period of several hours. Leave the door open a crack and watch them closely, turning often, to keep them from burning."

It's also fine to leave the leaves whole and break them up when you choose to use them."

Depending on what herbs you're freezing, you can chop them according to your taste, or what you plan on using them for in the future. Remove leafy herbs from their stems and roll them on the board in loose little \"cigar\" shapes, then chop them into thin strips, then chop them across the mince. Roughly chop hearty herbs like sage and dill before freezing them. Pull heartier small-leaf herbs like thyme or tarragon from their stems and freeze them directly without chopping."

You don't need to soak them, just pour a little on to get them to form solid cubes. For an added treat, consider using a liquid other than water. You can make lemonade-basil cubes, or rosemary-simple-syrup cubes if you want. Get creative. Sometimes, you won't need to do this at all, and herbs will freeze normally without any added water.
