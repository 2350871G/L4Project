          "description":"Spend some time thinking about how your room looks and feels now, and what you want to change or keep. Are there features in the room you want to play down or emphasize? Do you want your room to feel airier or cozier? The color you use can help you achieve the look and feel you have in mind. High contrast either in color or intensity can create a visual focal point of some feature in your room that you really love. Avoid sharp contrasts between color or intensity if you want to downplay areas or features in your room. Light or neutral colors can open up a small space. Deep, rich colors in warm tones will create a cozy, inviting space. Check to see if you can see other rooms from the room you plan to paint. If so, you'll want to make sure the colors of both rooms look good together. You don't have to paint the rooms the same color, but they should be coordinated.

You don't have to do bright white though! Light blue, pale green, even grey will open up the space.\""

Avoid sharp contrasts between colors in small rooms. Try cooler tones in neutral shades to help the room feel larger. If you have a small room but have your heart set on a dark color, you could open up the space by painting a lighter accent wall or using the dark color as part of a pattern or stripes. Large rooms can feel more cozy with medium to deep colors in warm tones."

          "description":"How large or small the room feels or appears to be can be affected by the ceiling. For instance, a large room can feel smaller if the ceiling is low, and a smaller room can feel bigger if the ceiling is very high. With a large room and a high ceiling, or a small room with a low ceiling, a contrast in color tone or intensity can visually separate the walls and ceiling. This will make a larger space feel more intimate and a small space feel more expansive. If your room is small and has a high ceiling, or is large with a low ceiling, keep the color tones the same. Make sure that the contrast between the walls and ceilings is moderate or low."

          "description":"Room color appearance can change depending on how much light the room gets. Also, the kind of light in the room is a factor in how the color looks. Natural light will change during the day, so how it affects wall color will change too. Try out your color options first. Paint sections of the walls and check to see how it looks throughout the day. Lighting fixtures also impact how colors will look. Paint a few sections in your color options, and then turn on the lights you will use most often to see how they affect the color. Lighting can also affect the way a color looks depending on the underlying tone of the shade. Paint comes in three tones, which are warm, cool, and neutral. Warm colors have a red undertone, while cool colors have a blue undertone. Lighting can bring out these undertones."

If there are multiple doors and windows throughout, your room will have a lot of color contrast between trim and door colors, and the wall color. If you want to downplay the contrast, paint all of the trim, doors, and window encasements the same color. Choose a color that compliments the wall color. If you want to play up the contrast, you may want to choose a glossy white for your trim, which will give the room a clean look."

A 2\u2019 x 2\u2019 square at eye level should be adequate. Paint a thick stripe near the flooring to be sure it works with your floor color and texture.

          "description":"Different color families affect how people feel; some colors are warmer, and others cooler, and these qualities are important for conveying a mood. Reds are hot or warm colors typically. Red is also a very hot color in terms of creating a feeling in a room. Red can feel romantic and dramatic, or lively and exciting. Blue is a cool color, and conveys a sense of calm and peace. Like the perfect clear light blue of a summer sky or the deep blue of the ocean, the soothing quality of blues won\u2019t vary much with intensity. Try green colors for a good balance between warm and cool. Because green is the result of a warm color (yellow) and a cool color (blue), it is an excellent choice for rooms with a neutral feel. Yellow is an energy color as well as a comforting hue. Yellow is a great choice for rooms that could use some brightening up while still feeling soft and tranquil. Neutrals like beiges or whites will almost always have a hint of color and tone. If you want a very quiet space these are a good choice, and you can introduce a suggestion of warmth or coolness by choosing a neutral with warm or cool colored tints."
