Since the kangaroo has long back legs, this horizontal line should be approximately the same length as the the vertical line. Add a dash to the top of the L. Draw a second curved line connected to the top of the vertical \"L\" line. This new line should only be one-quarter the length of the lower horizontal line. Also note that this line should extend outward in the same direction of the lower horizontal line, but it should curve in the opposite direction (upward instead of downward). This new line will form the lower part of the kangaroo's head. Connect the top point to the lower middle point.

These lines should mimic the curve of the back legs, but they should only be approximately one-quarter the length of the back legs. Draw three short parallel lines in between the lower two front leg lines; these will be the toes of the closest front leg. Add the tail.

Note that its size should roughly match the size of the back legs. After drawing the first tail line, draw another line just above it. Both lines should be connected to the body and should meet each other at a point. Add ears. Draw a shallow \"C\" curve at the back of the head, allowing the curve to slope upward. Connect the top of this curve to the head in a straight line, completing one ear. Draw another ear just like the first directly beneath the first. The second ear is \"closer,\" so it should be slightly larger. Note that both ears should be just a little smaller than the head itself. Give the kangaroo a face. Add a dot to the center of the face for an eye and a straight or gently curved line near the bottom of the head for the mouth. This is the final step.

Sketch a sideways cone with a rounded point. Leave the base of the cone open. The two slanted edges do not need to mirror one another. The bottom edge should be fairly horizontal, but the upper edge should slant upward at an approximate 45-degree angle. Both lines should stop at the same imaginary vertical boundary, however. Add two triangular ears. Draw a vertical triangle at the end of top muzzle line. Draw another vertical triangle just behind the first, but make it slightly smaller and partially hidden behind the first. The sides of the \"front\" ear should be roughly two-thirds the length of the upward muzzle line. Leave the bottom for the \"front\" ear open and the bottom of the \"rear\" ear closed. Sketch the neck lines. Draw a slightly curved line that comes down from the end point of the \"front\" ear triangle. This will be the back of the neck. Draw a straight line coming down from the end of the bottom muzzle line. This will be the front of the neck. The two lines should be nearly parallel, but the front neck line should be nearly twice as long as the back neck line. Draw a curved line for the back and tail. Sketch a downward-pointing arc starting at the bottom of the back neck. This arc should extend downward and away from the head. The first arc will only be the back of the kangaroo. To attach the tail, draw a straight line from the end of the back arc, keeping the connecting point smooth instead of sharp. Draw a second line from the tip of the tail, extending back toward the body. This second line should end where the first began, and the two combined should form a slightly curved triangle. Add the front leg and belly. Draw the front leg just beside the end point of the front neck line. Sketch a gently curved line for the stomach on the opposite side of the front leg. The top part of the front leg should angle back and away from the head; the middle part should be twice as long and should angle down and forward, gradually becoming more narrow near the bottom; the final part should be an enclosed-half circle for the paw. Note that the belly line should be roughly the same size as the middle part of the front leg. Sketch the back leg. The back leg has the shape of a capital \"L,\" and both the top and bottom of the leg should be the same size. Position the back leg at the end of the belly line. Sketch an arc at the front of the back leg (where it connects to the belly). This arc should open toward the back leg itself. Sketch another arc from the back of the back leg.

Draw a small arc from the front of the muzzle to represent the nose. Place a dot just beneath the top muzzle line, halfway between the nose and the ear; this represents the eye. The kangaroo is finished once you finish drawing the face. Method Three: Enclosed Shape Technique[4]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n[5]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source Draw three connecting ovals.

The muzzle should have rounded edges, and it should also point slightly downward. Make it just a little smaller than the circle itself. The ear should be thinner and slightly longer than the muzzle. It should also point upward. Smooth out the shape of the body. Draw lines that connect the head to the middle of the body, and separate lines that connect the middle of the body to the bottom. The lines connecting the head to the middle will form the neck. They should run tangent to both circles and be fairly straight on either side (left and right). The lines connecting the middle to the bottom will form the outer edge of the actual body. The top line should form a downward arc between the top of the middle oval and the top left of the bottom oval. The bottom line should be a smaller upward arc connecting the bottom of the middle oval to the right side of the bottom oval. After drawing your connecting lines, you can erase the inner oval/circle edges lying in between these new lines. Sketch blocks for the legs and tail. Sketch a series of three blocks for the arm, two blocks for the lower leg, and three blocks for the tail. The blocks forming the arm should start at the center of the middle circle and hang beneath the animal's belly. The first block should slant back and end where the oval ended; the second should slant forward and drop beneath the belly; the third should be slant back and be roughly half the size of the first. The blocks forming the back leg should form an \"L\" shape, and the top of the first block should connect to the bottom edge of the lowest oval. Both blocks should be the same size. The blocks forming the tail should connect to the lower left side of the lowest oval, just behind the back leg. Curve these blocks away from the body and make them progressively narrower. The final block should have a pointed outer tip. Smooth out the legs. Trace back over the outer edges of the arm and leg blocks, smoothing out the connecting points and making them less sharp. Angle the top line of the last block in each leg so that it comes down at a gentle \"C\" curve. Both of these last blocks should form the feet of the kangaroo. After smoothing out the legs, erase the inner block lines, leaving only the outline of each leg. Mirror the front and back legs. Draw a line just above the bottom leg line. It should match the direction and shape of the bottom leg line, but it should stop a little shorter than the established leg. Similarly, draw a line to the inside of front leg/arm line, matching the direction and shape of the front leg but falling just a little short of the overall length. Both of these new lines should form the legs \"furthest\" away from the viewer. Expand the tail. Smooth out the connecting points between the tail blocks, making them less sharp. Erase the inner tail lines, leaving only the outline behind. Detail the face. Erase the line between the muzzle and the main portion of the head, then draw a semi-circle nose at the tip of the muzzle. Add a large dot for the eye near the right edge of the original head circle. You should also add another ear that mimics the line of the first. Detailing the face is the final step in this drawing method. Once you finish drawing the face, the kangaroo should be done.",
