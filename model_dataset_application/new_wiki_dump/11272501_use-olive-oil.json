Save this olive oil to use when you really want the flavor to shine through. Try drizzling a small amount on eggs, avocado toast, roasted meat or veggies, and even sweets like yogurt or ice cream right before serving them. 3 out of 4 imported olive oils are falsely labeled as \"extra virgin.\" To tell if an olive oil is falsely labeled, check if it lists more than one country, region, or city on the label. This makes it more likely to be fake."

The better tasting your olive oil is, the better your salad dressing will taste. To make a more exciting salad dressing, add dijon mustard, jam, garlic, or herbs such as basil or oregano.

          "description":"Heat 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL) of olive oil in a skillet on the stove over medium heat. Once the oil is hot (after about 1-2 minutes) crack an egg into the skillet and add salt and pepper. Cook the egg for about 2 minutes for a runny yolk or 3 minutes for a medium yolk. Regular, pure, or refined olive oil is ideal for cooking and frying. It's cheaper than extra virgin and has the same health benefits, but isn't quite as flavorful. The olive oil will bubble and pop in the skillet. Stay back to avoid getting burned with hot olive oil, and turn the heat down if it starts popping a lot or smoking."
