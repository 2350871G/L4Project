In addition, it can also lend a Victorian air to a room, depending on the style and color you go with. If you want something more understated, choose white so the velvet doesn't stand out quite as much. Velvet is a great insulator, so your curtains will help keep the cold or the warmth from seeping through your windows."

If you want it more bold, try a a velvet wallpaper with an interesting pattern. Your guests won't be able to resist touching it! Avoid using velvet wallpaper or moisture-prone areas, like the kitchen or bathroom. Velvet is difficult to clean and repair, so it\u2019s best used in areas with less traffic."

Add other textures and fabrics to every room, as it will give the rooms more depth and interest. Plus, since velvet is expensive, you can be kind to your wallet by not using it everywhere. Using velvet as an accent creates a classy and glamorous feel."

A few pillows won't break the bank, and you can decide if you like the fabric or not. Plus, you can even do it yourself by making covers out of velvet for pillows you already have. Even just a touch of velvet can make the whole room seem more sophisticated. Another option is a velvet throw tossed over the arm of a couch. Velvet comes in many colors and textures (like crushed velvet) so your options are limitless."

The fabric feels great when you're lounging around, plus it's able to hide stains fairly easily. All-in-all, it can add a whole lot of glam to your space without you having to give up comfort. Keep in mind, though, that velvet is not a great fabric to have around kids. Because it has a nap, it will hold onto things like peanut butter and other sticky spills. Velvet is a timeless fabric that matches various styles from high-luxury to casual eclectic."

Plus, a high-backed armchair in velvet lends a classy air to the room, as it's a truly traditional look. In fact, if you find an old, much-loved armchair, you can have it reupholstered in your favorite color of velvet. If an accent chair is too much, consider just an ottoman or other small piece in velvet."
