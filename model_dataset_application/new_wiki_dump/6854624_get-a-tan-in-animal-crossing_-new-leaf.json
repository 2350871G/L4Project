      "description":"The best time you can get and maintain a tan is during Summer, and the Summer period of the game lasts from July 16 to September 15. After that, your tan fades away, and you can\u2019t maintain it until the next summer rolls around."

      "headline":"Head to the Island.",
      "description":"If you have unlocked and can afford to get to Tortimer\u2019s Island on a regular basis, you can get and maintain a tan year-round by going there in the mornings. You can unlock the island by paying off the first house upgrade, and the following day you\u2019ll be shown a scene. Afterwards, you can then take trips to the Island for 1000 Bells per round-trip. You can make several round trips to the Island a day as long as you have enough Bells."

    {
      "headline":"Get out a lot.",
      "description":"Of course, you\u2019ll need to get out a lot to get a tan. Leave your umbrellas behind, and get some sun on you! The best times to tan are from 10 AM to 4 PM, since it\u2019s when the sun is out. In this particular version, you get darker every 15 minutes until you reach the darkest tan. When you take a long break from the sun, your tan starts to fade. Staying inside, or venturing out on rainy or cloudy days would make your tan fade much more slowly than getting one. It takes roughly 15 days to go from the darkest tan to no tan at all, and requires you to stay indoors a lot or to use an umbrella constantly."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Check your clothes.",
      "description":"Your clothes can determine how fast you\u2019ll tan. Wearing clothes that cover most of your body like dresses and long-sleeved tops, hats, and most facial decorations can slow down or prevent tanning. So you\u2019re better off wearing tank tops or short-sleeved shirts, shorts and skirts if you want to tan."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Get a Mii Mask.",
      "description":"If all of this sounds too much effort, just get a Mii Mask with a tanned skin color! You\u2019ll have to make a Mii first in the Mii Maker available in your 3DS, and select a darker skin color, but once you have one, you can head on over to Shampoodle and ask for a makeover. It costs 3000 Bells, and uses a Mii you have stored in your unit. If you have the Welcome Amiibo update, it will change you skin colour to match the mask! Any hat and face accessories will be removed when equipping a Mii Mask, so make sure you have enough free space for your stuff when you equip it. To unlock Shampoodle, you need to spend a total of 10,000 Bells between the Able Sisters\u2019 Store and Kicks, and have Kicks open for at least 7 days before building Shampoodle. It\u2019ll take 4 days to be built, and can be found above the Able Sisters\u2019 Store in Main Street. You can put on your Mii Mask via the Designs window, which you can access by pressing Y and tapping the pencil icon with your stylus. Just select your Mii Mask from the window, and you can walk around with a new face."
