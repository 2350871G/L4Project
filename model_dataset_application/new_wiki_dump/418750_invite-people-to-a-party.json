People are likely to look at your invitation and make a quick first impression -- you want that first impression to be informative and fun. If your party doesn't have a theme, have the invitation mirror the formality of the party. If you're throwing a black tie soiree, keep it simple with a plain border, a fancy font, and to-the-point text. If you're throwing a rave, make your invitation as wild as you'd like. You can also send a mail to your friends and relatives to give an invitation for a party."

Can your apartment hold 10 people, 50 people, 200 people? Is it okay for the people you invite to bring friends? How many friends? Do you have a say over who those friends are? How many people can you feed and have drinks for at your party? Does this include friends of friends? If you're having your party at a club, bar, hotel, rented room, etc., does the owner have limits on the number of people that can be there?"

Before or after dinner is usually a safe bet. People are generally less busy between 5 and 6pm, or after 7pm. Gauge what time they eat dinner (different cultures, different times) and work around that. Earlier in the week is best, too. Don't call too late! Call before 9:30 or 10:00pm.

Try starting out with the usual pleasantries. \"How are you? \", \"How is work going? \", and \"How's the family?\" are often good starting points. Choose a natural pause in conversation or termination of a subject to bring up that you are having a party. After you have alerted them to the party, you can answer any immediate questions the guest might have, and even gauge interest through tone of voice."

Describe what your party will be like, and how excited you are. You can say something like \"I'm really looking forward to it; it's going to be great!\" You can also use tone and body language in a personal conversation for added effect.
