Arrowroot and tapioca are root starches derived from tropical plants, and along with potato starch are commonly used in gluten-free cooking. For arrowroot powder, mix 2-3 tablespoons (16-24 g) with the same amount of water. Whisk into a cup of hot broth, then slowly combine with the rest of the broth. For potato starch, mix 1 tablespoon of starch (10 g) with 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of water. Whisk into a cup of hot broth then combine with the rest.

Depending on how much thickening the broth needs, place 1-3 tablespoons of fat in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in an amount of flour equal to the amount of fat used. Cook for about ten minutes, stirring frequently, then let it cool before adding to the broth. Whisk the roux into the broth until combined, making sure there are no lumps. For a lighter roux, use butter or oil. For a darker, richer roux, use drippings."
