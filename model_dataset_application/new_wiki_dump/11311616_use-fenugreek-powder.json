          "description":"Mix 1 tablespoon (5 g) of the powder into a glass of about 1 cup (240 mL) of water or milk. The water or milk can be left cold or warmed up first if you prefer it that way. It\u2019s a quick and easy way to get the possible benefits of fenugreek powder, including lowered appetite and blood sugar levels. You could also eat the powder plain, but putting it in a drink makes it more enjoyable. The powder mix can be taken up to twice a day. Try drinking it once in the morning, then again at night."

Wait to put the fenugreek powder in until the water reaches a boil. If you don\u2019t have a kettle handy, you could boil water in a pot on the stove.

Since you\u2019re using powder, you won\u2019t need to strain the tea before drinking it. The powder will dissolve in the water. If you steep leaves or seeds, pour the tea through a strainer before drinking it."

          "description":"The powder will give it a taste somewhat like maple syrup, so you could add some additional flavoring if you prefer. Honey and stevia are a few good ways to give the tea a lighter, gentler flavor. Fenugreek tea is often used to treat inflammation, aid digestion, and improve weight loss. You can drink the tea once or twice a day to get any potential benefits it offers. It\u2019s meant to be used in place of fenugreek powder mixed into water or milk."

You could also add essential oils, such as 6 drops of rosemary oil, or 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of aloe vera gel. Aloe vera gel and essential oils are often used to clean and protect skin.
