For most orchids, spring is the ideal time for transplantation, but there are also other factors to consider. An orchid should be transplanted:\nAfter the plant has bloomed and is growing new roots or leaves\nWhen the roots and plant start to overgrow the current pot\nWhen it\u2019s not currently flowering or forming new flowers\nIf the pot breaks\nIf the plant becomes infested with bugs\nIf growing medium is wet and not draining properly"

          "description":"Pot choice for orchids is important, and this includes the size and the style. Transplanting an orchid into a pot that\u2019s too large will force the plant to focus on root growth rather than flowering. Also, for an orchid to survive, it has to be placed in a pot with drainage holes. Pick a pot that will allow for one to two years of growth, but nothing larger than that. If you're not sure about how much growth there will be, opt for a pot that\u2019s just one size larger than the current one. You can use plastic or terra cotta pots for orchids. Terra cotta pots require more frequent watering. Use pots with holes in the sides so there's lots of air flow. Opt for a shallow pot versus a deep one to prevent water buildup."

Because of this, many orchids cannot grow in regular potting soil, and instead need a very loose soil that\u2019s amended with chunks of bark and other organic matter. Popular mediums for orchids include coconut husk, sphagnum moss, perlite, fir bark, and mixtures of these."

Instead, give it enough to moisten the growing medium it\u2019s currently in. Remember to fertilize your orchid once per week with a weak 20-20-20 fertilizer solution."

It\u2019s important to use a sterilized tool to prevent the spread of viruses and diseases. One way to sterilize your cutting tool is by holding it over an open flame until the metal glows red hot. You can also soak the knife or scissors in a disinfectant, such as iodine or alcohol. Soak for about 20 minutes. Another way to sterilize your instrument is by boiling it in water for 20 minutes."

Use your sterilized cutting tool to trim away any roots that are soft and brown, any leaves that are yellowing, and any pseudobulbs that are black and shrivelled. A pseudobulb is a feature on some orchid types. It\u2019s a bulbous growth near the base of the plant that will have a leaf growing from it. If you're transplanting multiple orchids at once, sterilize your cutting tool in between plants by wiping it with a disinfectant or heating it with a flame."
