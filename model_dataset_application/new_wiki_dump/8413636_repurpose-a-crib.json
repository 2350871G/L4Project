Even seemingly minor things on a crib, such as a faulty latch, may harm your baby. Doing a preliminary search for any obvious problems can help you identify potential issues, recognize if you should keep the crib, and protect your baby from harm. Toss a crib that has visibly broken or defective parts. For example, broken slats, missing parts, or a defective bed spring can cause serious injury to your baby. In addition, toss a crib that that has bars more than 2 3/8 inches apart because they pose a strangulation risk. Don\u2019t trust someone else or a second hand store to determine if a crib is safe. Find out for yourself, before you take an old crib."

Remove any paint and then repaint or stain the crib with non-toxic, Zero VOC, no odor and baby safe paint. Clean any dirt or grime on the crib with a moistened towel. Allow it to dry completely. Sand the entire crib with medium (180#) or fine (220#) grit sandpaper. You can also use a sanding sponge. Remove any sanding dust. Apply at least 2 coats of your paint. Wait 4 hours between coats. Add a clear finish topcoat if you like. Allow the paint to dry thoroughly in a well-ventilated area before your baby occupies it. Even after the paint has dried completely, make sure that there is no lingering smell. Babies have very sensitive systems, so it is crucial to wait until the fumes have completely cleared the area."

          "description":"Your baby will spend a lot of time in their crib. Old mattresses can harbor allergens, have defects, and/or may not meet current safety guidelines. Replacing any mattress with a brand new one can ensure that your baby gets enough rest and stays safe. Buy the best quality mattress you can afford. Choose from a foam or innerspring mattress that is firm. A firm mattress will have little to no indentation when you press into it. A soft mattress can increase the risk for suffocation or SIDS if it conforms to your baby\u2019s head. Make sure the mattress fits snugly into each corner of the crib. There shouldn\u2019t be any gaps between the sides of the crib and the mattress. You can check this by seeing how many fingers fit in the gap. If it is more than 2, the gap is too large."

Remove any mobiles if your baby can push up on their hands and knees. Do not hang clothes, blankets, decorations or anything else on the sides of your baby\u2019s crib either.

Some cribs are designed to easily convert to a toddler bed, while others require the simple installation of a universal guardrail.

This will let you know if it already has a build-in conversion feature. If you can\u2019t find instructions for your crib at home, you often can find them online. Companies such as Graco, Bellini, DaVinci Baby, and Child Craft provide downloadable manuals online. Buy a conversion kit for your crib at retailers such as Pottery Barn Kids, Walmart, Target, or even your local hardware store. Many of these companies also offer online videos to further assist you in the conversion. Read the instructions or watch related videos carefully before you begin the crib conversion.

If you have an old crib that doesn\u2019t meet safety guidelines or a newer crib that you no longer need, you can use the side rail to create a headboard for a full-sized adult bed. Purchase posts from a home improvement or hardware store. You\u2019ll connect these to your side rail for stability. Consider getting posts that not only match your side rail, but that are already sanded. Sand the side rail and then paint it and the posts in a color you like. Let the paint dry and then join the side rail to the posts with dowels. Glue the parts together, clamp them, and let dry for 24 hours. If the rail has a curved side, then it will already look like a nice headboard. The other side of the crib should work well as a footboard so you get a cohesive look."
