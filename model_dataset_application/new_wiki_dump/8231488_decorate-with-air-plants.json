          "description":"One way to decorate with air plants, is to mount them on your wall. Air plants do not grow roots, and as a result they can be attached to a variety of different objects and mounted on your wall as a form of wall art. Decorating with air plants using wall mounts is an excellent idea if you do not have a lot of space in your home or office. You can attach air plants to a panel of boards, a piece of driftwood, a seashell, a wreath, a wall sconce, a frame, or any object you desire. Once you have selected a suitable object, for example, driftwood, attach the air plant to that object. This can be done using glue, wire, twist ties, fishing line, nails or staples. In this case you may want to glue the air plant onto the driftwood along with some other decorations. If you are using wire, make sure that there is no copper in the wire because this can kill the plant. If you are using staples or nails, make sure that you attach the plant at the root. Nailing or stapling through the green base of the plant can kill it."

Air plants do not require much water, but they do need minimal sunlight. When mounting an air plant display on your wall consider the following tips:\nDetermine the surface material of the wall. Most houses will have drywall, but some older homes have plaster walls. Plaster is much thicker and may require a different type of nail. For instance, a push pin will not be sufficient for mounting on drywall. Find a stud. When you are mounting something on a wall, you should always try and find a stud. This is especially important if you are hanging something heavy. In order to find a stud, you can use a stud finder, or you can simply knock on the drywall. Once you find a stud the knocking noise will change from hollow to solid. Studs help to anchor the mount to the wall. Make sure there are no pipes or wires behind the mount. This can be done by using a stud finder. If you find there are a lot of wires in the area, then you should cut off the power to that area of the house while you are drilling. Drill a hole and then fasten and anchor the mount to the wall."
