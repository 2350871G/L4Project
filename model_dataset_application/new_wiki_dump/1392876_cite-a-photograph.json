Notes allow you to provide more complete information about your sources than inline citations. The format of a footnote or endnote will vary depending on which style you are using, but it should include the name of the photographer, title of the photograph, date, and current location of the photo. In the Chicago Manual of Style Format, a footnote citation for a photo should look like this: 27. Harold Rouse, Limestone Statue of an Egyptian Goddess, ca. 1933, photograph, Imaginary Museum of Ancient Art. If the photograph has no title, use a brief description in brackets. For example, [Cat Playing with a Toy Mouse]."
