Which spirit level you buy should depend on how often you plan to use it, and the length or width of the objects you will be measuring. If you need a spirit level for general use to measure a variety of object sizes, a Carpenter\u2019s Level is probably the one for you. These are between 2 and 6 feet long. Try a Torpedo level if you want a portable option that will fit in a toolbox and measure tight spaces. They can be as small as 6 inches. These levels generally have a diagonal vial to help you find level at 45 degrees. A Mason\u2019s level is great for measuring wide and long surfaces like walls. They can be four feet or longer. However, it will not work for measuring smaller objects, so it\u2019s not a good choice for an all-purpose level."

          "description":"Your level probably has two small vials, or liquid-filled tubes: one horizontal and one vertical. You will use the horizontal vial to find the horizontal plane. You will notice that the vial has a bubble and two lines in the center, which are called guidelines. When you measure your horizontal object, and the bubble falls between the two guidelines, then it is completely flat and even, or \u201clevel.\u201d Another way of thinking about this is that a level object is completely parallel to the horizon. If during your horizontal measurement, you find that the bubble is outside the left guideline, then your object\u2019s left side is higher than your right. If the bubble is outside the right guideline, then your right side is higher than your left. When you measure your vertical object, and the bubble falls between the two guidelines, then it is completely vertical, or \u201cplumb.\u201d A plumb object is perpendicular to the earth. If during your vertical measurement, you find that the bubble is outside the top guideline, then your object\u2019s top side is bulging forward. If the bubble is outside the bottom guideline, then your object\u2019s bottom side is bulging forward."

Check to see whether the bubble is within the guidelines, to their right or left (horizontal), or to the top or bottom (vertical). If your object is very wide or tall, you may find that an average-sized spirit level cannot give you an accurate reading on its own. In this case, the easiest solution is to find a larger level. Consider investing in a level that is at least 1 meter (3.3 feet) long for the most versatility. Another option is to rest the level on top of a long or tall straightedge during your measurement."

This will be the case if you are measuring rain gutters or a patio on the horizontal plane, which must have a slight slope to drain rain properly. Some levels have two outer lines in the vial, which measure the 2-percent slope, or \u201cgrade,\u201d that is necessary for these kinds of projects."

          "description":"Laser levels can be pocket-size or as large as a full-size construction device. While those new to levels will want to start with a spirit level, you may find that a laser level is a great option if you want to invest in a device that is more accurate and portable. Consider a variety of types depending on your budget and project. A dot or point laser level is the smallest and most budget-friendly option. It\u2019s a good place to start with laser levels. Keep in mind that it throws an even line of light in one plane at a time, and often in one direction (unless you purchase a multi-point level). It is best for smaller projects like hanging curtains or checking that a group of pictures is in line. Try a cross line laser if you want a smaller device for home use that can measure both the horizontal and vertical plane at once. Keep in mind that unlike the dot laser, this one will usually need a tripod (as most laser levels do). This level is ideal for hanging pictures. Consider a larger rotary laser level for larger projects like leveling windows and doors. It can also be used outdoors, and even for professional use such as construction and surveying. It also needs a tripod. The final type of level recommended for home use is a tile laser level. As its name suggests, it has one signature use: laying tile. This level can allow you to center tiles much more easily, keeping them in perfect line with other tiles. However, it must be used on a completely flat surface, not an uneven, slanting floor. It can also be used for laying hardwood and other types of flooring."

Laser levels work like projectors, sending a direct beam of light that reveals what a level line looks like in a given plane. As with a spirit level, adjust your laser level\u2019s settings according to whether you are measuring the horizontal, vertical, or even diagonal plane. If you are working outdoors or in a bright space, you may need to wear red laser glasses, which will allow you to see the beam more clearly."
