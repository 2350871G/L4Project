          "description":"You can track down a qualified antique appraiser near you with a quick Internet search. A certified appraiser will inspect your antique furniture and make determinations about how old it is, who the original maker was, whether it\u2019s genuine or reproduced, and how much it\u2019s currently worth. They\u2019ll then provide you with a document acknowledging the estimated value of your item or items, which you can use to negotiate sales with authority. A professional appraisal is recommended if you think that one of your items might be especially rare or valuable.Warning: Hiring an appraiser could cost you as much as $200-400 per hour, so it may not be the most cost-effective strategy unless you have reason to believe that a certain piece may be worth a lot of money."

These appraisals are typically sold in packages that offer various perks, such as the history of a given piece or an official certificate of valuation. Web-based appraisals typically start at around $10-20 per piece, making them a much more affordable alternative to hiring a professional antiques appraiser in the flesh. For a slightly higher rate, some websites give you the option of signing up for a monthly membership that gives you access to features like instant valuations, detailed sales records, and exclusive pricing guides."

Auction houses often hold \u201cvaluation days\u201d where in-house appraisers look over antiques brought in by interested parties. These appraisals are generally free of charge. Verbal appraisals are the way to go for most newer antiques in decent shape. There are both pros and cons to verbal appraisals. On the one hand, they tend to be free, which means they allow you to maximize the profit you stand to make. On the other hand, they don\u2019t come with any kind of certification, which means the average buyer may be skeptical of your asking price."

If you\u2019re on Ebay, use the site\u2019s \u201cadvanced search\u201d feature to pull up a list of completed sales for similar items.
