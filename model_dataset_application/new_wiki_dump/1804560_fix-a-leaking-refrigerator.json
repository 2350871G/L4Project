Slowly slide it straight out from under the fridge, as it likely has some water in it. Look for any cracks, holes, warping, or other signs of damage. The drain pan collects condensate from the freezer compartment of the appliance. When the fridge is operating properly, the collected water will evaporate before the pan comes close to filling. If the pan is full or overflowing, the fridge may not be leveled properly, there may be a water line leak, or there may be another issue with the fridge. Try the other troubleshooting measures described in this article, then call a repair technician if needed."

You may be able to order a replacement pan directly from them, or get a part number that you can use to find the correct replacement pan online. If you can\u2019t get the replacement pan within a few hours, slide the old pan back in place for the time being. Once you get the right replacement pan, slide it into place and pop the grille back on. With any luck, your leaky fridge will be fixed!"
