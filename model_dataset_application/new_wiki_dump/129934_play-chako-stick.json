He or she must use another real small piece of rock or whatever and lever the small piece of wood in maybe at a 45 degree angle using the ground and small rock(hope you figure it out) and then by striking down with the long piece and hitting the small piece in the front tip. While it is in the air hit it towards the field where the other team is and smack it hard (excuse my language). If he or she hits it then and no one catches it is another 50 points and if he or she hits it over everyone it is 100 points.If someone catches it is considered an out. If unable to hit it on the first try it is an out."
