If you don't have a deep fryer, don't worry. You can use a piece of bread to check your oil's temperature as well."

Then make long, vertical slices, following the onion's long, visible lines. Finally, cut horizontally across these long cuts to get small squares. For even smaller pieces, stand the onion up on its end and cut each part in half once more before cutting your squares."
