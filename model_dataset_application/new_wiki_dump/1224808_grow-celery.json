It does not like extreme temperatures and grows best with conditions under 75 \u00b0F (24 \u00b0C) during the day and between 50 and 60\u00b0 Fahrenheit (10-16\u00b0 C) at night. Some varieties include Conquistador and Monterey, which are ready for harvest earlier than most varieties, Golden Boy, which produces stunted stalks, and Tall Utah, which produces tall, vibrant stalks."

However, make sure the planting area you choose is not prone to flooding. You may want to build a raised bed to plant your celery in. Keep in mind that some varieties of celery grow very large, harvestable roots, so make sure to build your planter deep enough if you choose to do so. Use cedar wood to build the planter bed if possible, as it does not mold when it gets wet."

Though celery does not require impeccable drainage like most vegetables, it does require rich, healthy soil. Evaluate the soil's calcium and magnesium levels in order to determine what type of limestone to add to your soil. If the soil is low in magnesium, add dolomitic limestone. If it is high in magnesium, add calcitic limestone. Add the limestone 2 to 3 months before planting if possible to allow the soil to absorb it. After adding, check the pH again."

To speed up germination, you can pre-soak your seeds in water overnight. Cover with about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of potting soil, but do not pat down with your fingers after sowing the seeds. Celery seeds need a lot of light to germinate. Water the peat pots to moisten the soil after planting your seeds. Place your seeds in a warm place so that the soil stays between 70 and 75\u00b0 Fahrenheit (21-24\u00b0 Celsius) until the seeds germinate. This should take 2 to 3 weeks. After germination, place the seedlings in a cooler indoor location so that the soil is between 60 and 70\u00b0 Fahrenheit (16-21\u00b0 Celsius). Carefully thin the seedlings so that there is only 1 per cell after they germinate."
