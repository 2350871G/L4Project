  "text":" Painting the Pine Cones Brush off any debris from each pine cone. Inspect each cone for damage and discard any that don't meet your standards. Cover a flat surface with newspaper to create a workspace. Find an area for the pine cones to dry. Cover the dry area with newspaper too. Pour the paint into the paper bowl or plate. Grab a few heavy duty paper towels. Keep the paper towels on hand in case the paint drips or you need to remove excess paint from the brush.

Making the Place Cards Consider whether you want to hand write each guest\u2019s name on the card or if you\u2019d prefer to have them laser printed.

Create the place cards by either typing names and printing from your computer or by writing names on individual place cards by hand. Keep finished place cards in a safe area until ready to be joined with the pine cone. Assembling and Placing Your Place Cards Wedge one place card into the top of the dried pine cone. Each placement will not be perfect, so just look for natural spots in the cone that will hold the place card neatly on top of the pine cone. Double check each pine cone to ensure it has fully dried before leaving it at the guest\u2019s place. Finished.",
