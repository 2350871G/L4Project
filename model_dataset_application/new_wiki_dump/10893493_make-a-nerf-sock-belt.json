  "text":" Making the Belt Gather your supplies. You will need quality hook-and-loop fasteners, duct tape, and socks. Cut out a large strip of the hook-and-loop fastener. It should be about 4 inches longer than your waist and about 2 inches wide. You can find your waist length by the first number in your pant size (e.g. if your pants are 34/38, your waist is 34 inches long) Attach a patch of the part of the hook-and-loop fastener you did not use in the previous step (e.g. if you used hook, use loop in this step) to one end of the strip of hook-and-loop you made in the previous step. This will allow you to make a belt for you to attach your socks to. Test your belt. Try to attach it around your waist. If you can wear it comfortably, go on to the next part. Making the Socks Take the socks and fold or roll them into a ball or a ball-like shape. This will allow you to throw them more easily. Put a piece of tape around the socks so that they will maintain their shape. This will also allow you to more easily add a piece of hook-and-loop fastener in the next step. Attach a small piece of hook-and-loop fastener (opposite the type used for the main belt) to the duct-taped portion of the sock. This will allow you to easily attach the socks to the belt. Fasten the socks to your belt and use them in a Nerf war! This will give you a quiet way to tag your opposition.",
