Mushrooms contain a lot of water, so they'll shrink considerably during cooking. Also be aware that they soak up fat readily, so always use quality butter or oil for cooking. Roast mushrooms to bring out their natural sweetness. Coat them in oil and roast in the oven at 400 degrees until well browned. Bread mushrooms as you would chicken and fry them in hot oil. Make sure you use a high quality oil suitable for frying. Stir fry sliced mushrooms with soy sauce and oil for a simple dish. Grill mushrooms in the summertime. Simply place the mushrooms directly on the grill pan and cook until browned. Experiment with marinades for extra flavor. Saut\u00e9 them in a pan. This is one of the most common methods.

Before you start doing anything else in a recipe that calls for using dried mushrooms, start rehydrating them. Use room temperature water. Cover the mushrooms generously. Thinly sliced mushrooms should only need to soak for about 1/2 an hour. Whole cap or thickly sliced mushrooms might need to soak 8 hours or more.

Some species of poisonous mushroom can look very similar or just like some popular varieties of edible mushrooms\nFor example, the green spored lepiota mushroom is very toxic but resembles the white button mushrooms you can find in the grocery store. Only eat a mushroom if you have a 100% positive id. Even after identifying the mushroom's safety, only try a little to begin with to ensure that you don't react to it badly. Use multiple field guides to identify a mushroom. If you aren't sure of an ID, ask an expert before you cook it. When in doubt, throw the mushroom away."

It is a good idea to carry a mushroom guide with you to help you identify areas where mushrooms will grow and what species they are. Mushrooms have different seasons. The mushroom season is between late spring and early fall in most areas of North America. The best time to look for mushrooms is after a rainy period. Mushrooms need a lot of moisture to grow. If you're mushroom hunting somewhere new to you, ask locals for advice. Deadly twins exist, where a mushroom that is safe in one place may be poisonous in another even though they look the same."

These will allow too much moisture to build up and might diminish the taste and quality of your mushrooms. Plastic grocery bags also don't offer enough protection.
