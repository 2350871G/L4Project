  "text":" Keeping Fish Cold Keep your fish fresh. Seafood is very susceptible to spoiling. You need to keep it as cold as possible before freezing. When bringing it home from the market, keep it in a cooler or a freezer bag to help maintain it's freshness, along with some ice or frozen food. Use ice to keep fish fresh while fishing. Ice is the most effective way to cool down fish to take home from fishing. You can even use ice to kill small fish, as it almost immediately immobilizes them. Use crushed ice for this purpose. For every 1 pound of fish you have, you need at least 2 pounds of ice. Set the small fish in ice whole. For smaller fish, just set the fish (alive) into the ice as they would be in the water. That is, place them like they're swimming, not on their sides. Kill, scale, and gut large fish first before putting them on ice. Slice off the head at the gills. Scale the fish.

Continue running the knife over the fish until the scales are gone, rinsing the scales off the knife as you go. Once you've cleaned out the inside of the fish, pack it with ice. Place it in an ice-filled cooler. Check the ice often. Once it melts down some, pour off the water, and pour in more ice. Preparing and Freezing Fish Freeze fish fillets in bags. Fillet the fish. Holding the tail, cut under the fillet just above the backbone, moving towards the head. Once you cut the fillet off, use your knife to remove the skin, if desired.
