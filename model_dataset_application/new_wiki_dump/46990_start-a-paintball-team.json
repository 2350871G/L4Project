Make it colorful and creative to catch the eye of passers-by. If you can, include a picture of a paintball gun or something similar to immediately indicate the type of team you\u2019re building. Make sure you get approval if you\u2019re going to post at a private business, in a high school, college or at the field.

However, you can also practice in an open field, a wooded area or a spacious backyard. Try to pick a regular time that works for all of your teammates. This will help avoid scheduling conflicts and make sure you can practice with everyone there as often as possible. Work on your strategy and teamwork during practice.

Would you be interested?\u201d\nTry to emphasize that a lot of people will attend tournaments to show that the advertisements will be effective.

Making sure you and your team have all of the protective gear you need is both a good idea and most likely a requirement at most commercial paintball fields. Paint splatter is very dangerous for the eyes so the most essential equipment is a mask. Paintball masks are designed to provide protection to the entire face while allowing enough room so you can still wear glasses, if you need them. The price of a mask will typically range from $15 to $50 and can be found at most sporting goods stores. You\u2019ll want to wear a long sleeve shirt and long pants so that no skin is exposed. While this is enough for many players, some will wear additional layers of clothing to provide additional protection. A paintball on the bare knuckles can be painful and cause injury so wear protective gloves. Paintball gloves are typically fingerless to make it easier to pull the trigger. A paintball to the neck can be very painful so wear a scarf. Some players wear a turtle neck sweater instead."

Take practice shots before each match to ensure that the gun is shooting straight and that it\u2019s assembled properly. Use a chronograph to measure the velocity of paintballs leaving the gun. Many paintball fields will require that guns have maximum velocity of 300 feet per second to avoid injuries. Get enough paintballs. You\u2019ll want to bring at least 800 paintballs per player for a tournament match."
