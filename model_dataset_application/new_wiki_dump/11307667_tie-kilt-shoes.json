Pull the laces tight by tugging on them, just as you would to start tying ordinary shoes. If you don\u2019t have special ghillie brogues, you can improvise them by cutting the tongue out of ordinary dress shoes. Wear your ghillie brogues with long socks, with the ribs running vertically, garters, and, of course, a kilt."

If you do it any higher up your leg than that, the bow will start to slip down your ankle."

  "text":" Twisting the Laces Put your shoes on and pull the laces to tighten them. Make sure that the laces are threaded through each of the holes in the shoe.

If you don\u2019t have special ghillie brogues, you can improvise them by cutting the tongue out of ordinary dress shoes.

Tying the Bow Make a simple overhand knot at the front or side of your leg.
