Position your left hand on the bottom-left corner and your right on the bottom-right corner. Firmly push the wood through the saw, using your thumbs to push it forward and your remaining 4 fingers to press downward on the top of the wood. You can also use a table saw, jigsaw, or handsaw.

For those going for a rustic look, a quick sanding is enough. If you want a cleaner look, continue sanding until your boards are smooth. Sanding against the direction of the grain can destroy wood fibers\u2014always sand with the grain when possible. Purchase sanding guns for less labor-intensive sanding. To use these products, place the sandpaper to you wood, pull the trigger, and drag the sandpaper across the wood."

Always start spraying before you reach the wood. Move across and down the wood pieces with the spray, and move the can past each edge before you stop spraying to maintain consistency.
