In the mainline variant, your opponent will mirror your play and move to e5. Develop your king\u2019s knight to the f3 space to put pressure on your opponent\u2019s pawn. Your opponent will usually move their queen\u2019s knight to c6 in response. Then, move your king\u2019s bishop diagonally to b5 so you can attack the knight next turn. Pawns can only advance 2 spaces the first time they move. Development refers to moving your more powerful pieces out from the back row and toward the center of the board. This opening allows you to easily maneuver across the board while freeing up the space between your rook and king so you can castle, which is when you move your king next to your rook and then put the rook on the opposite side. This helps protect your king."
