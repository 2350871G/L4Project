If you choose to leave the seeds whole, treat them as garnishes or as a way to add texture. You can also replace some flour in baked goods with whole flax seeds to lower the gluten.Tip: If you're unsure whether or not you like the flavor and texture of flax seeds, start by adding a few pinches of them to your dishes."

If you'd rather toast them in the oven, spread them on a dry sheet and roast them at 375 \u00b0F (191 \u00b0C) for 5 to 10 minutes. Toast the seeds in small batches, since toasted flax seeds won't keep as long as raw flax seeds. Try to use the toasted flax seeds immediately."

You could also top salads or soft avocado slices with the seeds. If you like to prep your oatmeal the night before, go ahead and place the seeds on top. They may soften slightly, but they'll still add a nutty flavor to the oatmeal. You could scatter the seeds over stir-fry dishes in place of sesame seeds."
