Leave about  2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) in between both sides, depending on how large of a wrap you are using. This way, your wrap\u2019s contents do not fall out as you take a bite."

This keeps it tucked in as you make your folds. Tucking the filling into the wrap helps you fold it tightly, and the filling is less likely to come out."

You may fold your wrap 1-3 times, depending on its size. The amount of filling also determines how many folds you\u2019ll make. If your wrap is super stuffed, you may only have to fold it 1 more time. If it is on the thinner side, 2 folds may work great."
