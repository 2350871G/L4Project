          "description":"The first thing you want to do is to remove the grease, so that you can reach the stain underneath. There are a number of ways to do this and which you choose should be based on preference and what is available to you. Try:\nSoaking the shirt in dish detergent. Cover the collar stain in regular liquid dish soap, like Dawn. Let it soak for an hour (or more) and then rinse it out. The shirt will probably need to be wet first, to really help the soap soak in. Using Fast Orange or similar degreasers. Use products like Fast Orange, which are designed to cut through kitchen grease. Spray them on, allow them to soak for 5 minutes, and then rinse them away. Be careful of very harsh products though, as these can irritate the skin. Using shampoo for greasy hair. Using shampoo designed for greasy hair in a similar process as described above for Dawn can yield surprising results. Adding to the grease. If none of the other methods work, some people swear by adding more grease to the shirt collar. In theory, the new fat molecules bond to the old ones and help drawn them out. Use products like lanolin hand cleaners, which can be found at drug stores or car shops."

This is another common cleaning product. If you don't have Oxyclean, you can make your own: it's basically just baking soda and hydrogen peroxide mixed together. Oxyclean will need to be placed on the stain and may need to be worked around to get the lifting effect. Just rub the shirt against itself."
