          "description":"If you're nervous about entering a party when you don't know anyone there, it's a good idea to calm yourself before trying to meet anyone. Take a deep breath, breathing all the way down to your belly, and breathing out slowly through your nose. Repeat this slow, deep breathing several times. Make sure your feet are placed firmly against the floor, so that you\u2019re well-grounded. Bring to mind a positive visualization. For example, imagine yourself looking sleek and sexy on the dance floor, or someone attractive laughing at your sense of humor. Realize that no one\u2019s paying attention to you, so there\u2019s no need to feel self-conscious. After all, most people attending parties are also nervous. Repeat this process anytime you start to feel nervous at the party."

          "description":"You may be feeling terrified, but if you smile you\u2019re more likely to look confident. Even if you don't know anyone else at the party, you can increase your social abilities through smiling. In addition, if you're feeling nervous, smiling can help to improve your mood, and reduce stress. People often respond to a smiling person with a smile of their own, which will make you feel even better. Even a slight smile will be enough to help your facial muscles relax, and your appearance seem less threatening to other party guests. When you look confident, you\u2019ll start to feel confident."

If you\u2019re attending a frat party, you\u2019ll need different social skills than you might at a Christmas carol party held by your mom\u2019s church choir. Remember that other people may not know one another either. Considering the nature of the party, try to gauge how likely it is that many people may be making their first introductions."

Figure out where the bathroom is, where the food is, where the drinks are, as a way to get comfortable at the party. Making your way around the party will also help you take stock of how many people are there, and what kind of party it is. There might be different activities going on in different parts of the space. If this is the case, you can start with the area in which you feel most at ease."

One of the reasons that strangers often talk about the weather is that it\u2019s one thing we all have in common. This isn\u2019t a bad place to start, but try to think of other options. For example, you might notice that someone\u2019s wearing a tee-shirt of your favorite band, which makes for a good conversation starter. If you\u2019re feeling self-conscious, finding similarities with others can help you calm down. Even in a new city or a country where you don\u2019t speak the language, you\u2019ll be able to find similarities if you\u2019re focused on finding them."

Even if the host doesn\u2019t need your help, she may pick up on your unspoken apprehension and provide something for you to do, or someone to introduce you to. If you\u2019ve brought some food or a bottle of wine with you to the party, this provides an instant project for your arrival. Upon arrival, you can ask where would be the best place to put it, or where the host would like you to put it."

Find someone who looks friendly at the buffet table, and make a pleasant remark about the food. For example, you might say something about how much you like one of the items or how glad you are to see that they\u2019ve included vegetarian options. Asking a question about the food is another good conversation starter. You might say, \u201cEverything looks so good. Which kind do you think you\u2019re going to pick?\u201d\nYou can follow up by introducing yourself or making follow-up statements.

At most parties, other guests will have taken care with their appearance and will appreciate the attention. You can also use a compliment to start a conversation by pairing it with a question. For example, you might say, \u201cThat\u2019s a really cool scarf. Where did you get it?\u201d\nAvoid compliments about the person\u2019s appearance, as this might make her uncomfortable."

Don\u2019t bring up overly personal details, whether of money, sex, illness or intimacy. Save these topics for people you know well. Making judgmental comments isn\u2019t likely to be appreciated. For example, \u201cYou\u2019d think she would know better than to wear that color with her complexion,\u201d may not be appreciated. Never ask a woman if she\u2019s pregnant. If she\u2019s gained weight, she may feel embarrassed."

When someone speaks to you, look at them attentively at least 70% of the time. Angle the front of your body towards the person who\u2019s talking, which will help the person know you\u2019re listening. You don\u2019t want to maintain eye contact for too long, as this might seem aggressive or overly flirtatious. Instead, limit the eye contact for 4-5 seconds, before looking away, then looking again."

This will make you seem more relatable and friendly. Be careful not to tell a story that may offend others. After all, humor is sometimes different across different groups of people. If you have a good story, it can fill in a conversational lull.

For example, asking about favorite movies is often a good way to find mutual interests. Something as simple as asking about the recent blockbuster can lead into multiple conversational paths. Making small talk might lead to deeper conversations, or it might not. Small talk is often less about the information shared than the good feelings that it provides. You\u2019ll want to stick to non-intimate, non-controversial topics to keep your conversation on a light note."

Use this as a means to get to know other people, whether through questions, comments, or observations. Be unfailingly complimentary in your comments. This would be the wrong time to complain about the lack of your favorite drink, or how you\u2019ve always hated evening gatherings. You could ask other people how they know the hostess, or if this is their first time among the group also."

          "description":"When you're nervous about not knowing anyone at a party, it might be difficult to concentrate on the conversations that come up. It will help your focus to repeat parts of what another person has said to assure them you've heard what was said. Use nonverbal cues, such as nodding, eye contact, and leaning towards the person, to let the other guest know that you're actively listening to what she has to say. Try to avoid talking over the other person while she\u2019s talking, even if she\u2019s talking about a topic you\u2019re interested in. Ask plenty of open-ended questions about topics the other guest has brought up in order to keep the conversation going. Be sensitive to the emotions that the conversation is bringing up in the person. Generally, party conversations tend to be fun and light. If you find your conversation getting too intense or emotional, it's okay to back off a little."

          "description":"Look for subtle signals in body language to help you gauge whether you should change the topic or find someone new to talk with. Be observant--these are signs you should be able to notice in almost everyone you meet. For example, if someone is making eye contact with you and nodding, they're interested in the conversation. Keep talking to them and doing what you're doing! If they're facing partially away from you or glancing around the room, they're not very engaged. Change the topic back to them with a question or find another person you haven't yet introduced yourself to."

Have an excuse prepared for needing to leave. This is a time when it\u2019s okay not to tell the truth. You can always say, \u201cI have to get up early tomorrow,\u201d or even just, \u201cPlease, excuse me. I need to find the ladies\u2019.\u201d\nYou can say, \u201cIt was nice to meet you,\u201d or \u201cGreat talking to you!\u201d Some people like to shake hands, but at some parties this might be too formal. If you like, you can include an excuse for breaking off the conversation. For example, you can say, \u201cI don\u2019t want to dominate your evening,\u201d or \u201cI should probably let you talk to other people here.\u201d"

You\u2019ll need to let others know that you\u2019d like to talk by physically moving closer to them than you might at a quieter party. Large parties are often more chaotic, with people interrupting one another, or talking quickly to make sure they get their point across. One way to effectively join in a group conversation is to repeat the last phrase that another person said, and join it with your own thoughts. For example, if someone\u2019s just shared a story about being in Paris in April, you might echo, \u201cYes, Paris in April is beautiful, and for my college graduation, I was able to go to Rome, which I thought was wonderfully diverse.\u201d\nTopics often change very quickly in a group conversation, so don\u2019t worry too much about being exactly on topic.

Each person has her own way of getting energized for a party. You might listen to the music, and try to get into the rhythm of it. Or, you can think of party scenes from some of your favorite movies, and imagine yourself in the role of the heroine. Even if you\u2019re not totally at ease about being at the party, trying act as if you\u2019re comfortable can help speed the process. (This is sometimes called, \u201cFake it until you make it!\u201d)\nIf you find yourself getting drained, make an excuse to get away for a short time. Taking a break by yourself can be a way for an introvert to recharge her batteries and return to the party refreshed."

Rather than becoming grumpy about what\u2019s not going to happen, it\u2019s a better idea to rescale your expectations. Conversations in groups tend to be very broad, about a wide range of rapidly shifting topics. The goal of party conversations tends to be less on exchange of information and ideas, than on sharing a common good feeling. Good conversational choices for talking in groups include: short funny anecdotes, joking around, wordplay. Topics to avoid include: detailed analysis of a topic, anything that might unintentionally offend others, including political discussion, or discussions of religious faith and practice."

Little side conversations often break off of larger group conversations, either related to the topic the larger group is discussing or completely unrelated. It\u2019s okay to talk while others are talking when you\u2019re in a large group; it\u2019s not rude to have a side conversation. Sometimes the conversation might end abruptly if the group conversation shifts to something more interesting.

See if you can signal your willingness to help him by making eye contact with him, nodding or smiling. Sometimes you can help support another person who\u2019s trying to make a point. For example, by asking a clarifying question about the subject he\u2019s brought up or restating what he\u2019s said in a new way. If you\u2019re good at talking in groups, make sure that you\u2019re not taking up too much of everyone\u2019s attention.

For example, asking about favorite movies is often a good way to find mutual interests. Something as simple as asking about the recent blockbuster can lead into multiple conversational paths. Making small talk might lead to deeper conversations, or it might not. Small talk is often less about the information shared than the good feelings that it provides. You\u2019ll want to stick to non-intimate, non-controversial topics to keep your conversation on a light note. Talk about the party or setting. One of the things you\u2019ll have in common with everyone else at the party is that you\u2019re both there. Perhaps you all had to battle traffic to get to the party. Use this as a means to get to know other people, whether through questions, comments, or observations. Be unfailingly complimentary in your comments. This would be the wrong time to complain about the lack of your favorite drink, or how you\u2019ve always hated evening gatherings. You could ask other people how they know the hostess, or if this is their first time among the group also. Be an active listener. When you're nervous about not knowing anyone at a party, it might be difficult to concentrate on the conversations that come up. It will help your focus to repeat parts of what another person has said to assure them you've heard what was said. Use nonverbal cues, such as nodding, eye contact, and leaning towards the person, to let the other guest know that you're actively listening to what she has to say. Try to avoid talking over the other person while she\u2019s talking, even if she\u2019s talking about a topic you\u2019re interested in. Ask plenty of open-ended questions about topics the other guest has brought up in order to keep the conversation going. Be sensitive to the emotions that the conversation is bringing up in the person. Generally, party conversations tend to be fun and light. If you find your conversation getting too intense or emotional, it's okay to back off a little. Pay attention to feedback to choose topics of conversation. Look for subtle signals in body language to help you gauge whether you should change the topic or find someone new to talk with. Be observant--these are signs you should be able to notice in almost everyone you meet. For example, if someone is making eye contact with you and nodding, they're interested in the conversation. Keep talking to them and doing what you're doing! If they're facing partially away from you or glancing around the room, they're not very engaged. Change the topic back to them with a question or find another person you haven't yet introduced yourself to. End the conversation gracefully. Conversations at parties start and end rapidly, and if you\u2019re talking with someone you\u2019ve just met, it\u2019s a good idea not to keep the conversation going on too long. Have an excuse prepared for needing to leave. This is a time when it\u2019s okay not to tell the truth. You can always say, \u201cI have to get up early tomorrow,\u201d or even just, \u201cPlease, excuse me. I need to find the ladies\u2019.\u201d\nYou can say, \u201cIt was nice to meet you,\u201d or \u201cGreat talking to you!\u201d Some people like to shake hands, but at some parties this might be too formal. If you like, you can include an excuse for breaking off the conversation. For example, you can say, \u201cI don\u2019t want to dominate your evening,\u201d or \u201cI should probably let you talk to other people here.\u201d Dealing With Large Parties Realize that you need to be more assertive. You\u2019ll need to speak with a louder voice if you want to be heard. You\u2019ll need to let others know that you\u2019d like to talk by physically moving closer to them than you might at a quieter party. Large parties are often more chaotic, with people interrupting one another, or talking quickly to make sure they get their point across. One way to effectively join in a group conversation is to repeat the last phrase that another person said, and join it with your own thoughts. For example, if someone\u2019s just shared a story about being in Paris in April, you might echo, \u201cYes, Paris in April is beautiful, and for my college graduation, I was able to go to Rome, which I thought was wonderfully diverse.\u201d\nTopics often change very quickly in a group conversation, so don\u2019t worry too much about being exactly on topic. Being friendly is the main consideration. Get into a party state of mind. If you\u2019re the kind of person who\u2019d rather be at home with a book, you might have a hard time adapting to being in a large group of people. Each person has her own way of getting energized for a party. You might listen to the music, and try to get into the rhythm of it. Or, you can think of party scenes from some of your favorite movies, and imagine yourself in the role of the heroine. Even if you\u2019re not totally at ease about being at the party, trying act as if you\u2019re comfortable can help speed the process. (This is sometimes called, \u201cFake it until you make it!\u201d)\nIf you find yourself getting drained, make an excuse to get away for a short time. Taking a break by yourself can be a way for an introvert to recharge her batteries and return to the party refreshed. Accept that you\u2019re unlikely to have a quiet conversation. If you really appreciate the kind of focused conversation that can happen between two people who know each other well, you\u2019ll have to adjust to the fact that this isn\u2019t likely to happen at the large party. Rather than becoming grumpy about what\u2019s not going to happen, it\u2019s a better idea to rescale your expectations. Conversations in groups tend to be very broad, about a wide range of rapidly shifting topics. The goal of party conversations tends to be less on exchange of information and ideas, than on sharing a common good feeling. Good conversational choices for talking in groups include: short funny anecdotes, joking around, wordplay. Topics to avoid include: detailed analysis of a topic, anything that might unintentionally offend others, including political discussion, or discussions of religious faith and practice. Start a side conversation. In a large group of people, you can sometimes find conversation easier by addressing one person, rather than the whole group. Little side conversations often break off of larger group conversations, either related to the topic the larger group is discussing or completely unrelated. It\u2019s okay to talk while others are talking when you\u2019re in a large group; it\u2019s not rude to have a side conversation. Sometimes the conversation might end abruptly if the group conversation shifts to something more interesting. It\u2019s okay to move back and forth between the small side conversation and the larger group conversation. Notice if you can help someone else. If you\u2019re attentive, you may notice that there\u2019s another person who can\u2019t make his way into the conversational flow. See if you can signal your willingness to help him by making eye contact with him, nodding or smiling. Sometimes you can help support another person who\u2019s trying to make a point. For example, by asking a clarifying question about the subject he\u2019s brought up or restating what he\u2019s said in a new way. If you\u2019re good at talking in groups, make sure that you\u2019re not taking up too much of everyone\u2019s attention. One way to do this is to use your skills to help others join in the discussion.",
