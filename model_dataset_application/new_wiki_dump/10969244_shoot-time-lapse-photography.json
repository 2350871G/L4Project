          "description":"Most smart phones these days have a time lapse mode in the camera app. Open up the app and scroll through the different modes until you find it. Keep in mind that the time lapse mode on your phone has few or no settings that you can adjust. If you want more control, then you will need to download a time lapse app instead."

          "headline":"Set your phone in a stable place so it won't move while you record.",
          "description":"A tripod with a phone mount is the ideal stabilizer for your phone. Prop your phone up against something that won't move if you don't have a phone tripod. If you are outside, keep in mind wind and other factors that could move your phone during recording. Make sure you have a full battery if you plan on shooting for a long time so your phone doesn't die in the middle of your time lapse!"

          "description":"Record longer periods for slower moving objects, and shorter periods for faster moving objects. The number of frames captured per second by your phone will depend on how long you record for. For example, if you are shooting slow moving clouds, then your time lapse will look much better if you record for 20 minutes vs. for 5 minutes. The frame rate drops the longer you shoot, so the length of the video will not vary greatly if you shoot for 10 minutes compared with if you shoot for 40 minutes. Most time lapse videos shot with phones are 20-40 seconds long, regardless of how long you shoot for."

        {
          "headline":"Download a 3rd party time lapse app if you want more settings to play with.",
          "description":"3rd party apps offer you much more control over settings like exposure, frame rate, white balance, video speed, and even let you set a timer or add filters. Search the app store for your model of smart phone, download a few time lapse apps, and experiment them to find one that you like. Some examples of nice time lapse apps are Framelapse, Lapse It, Microsoft Hyperlapse, Hyperlapse from Instagram, TimeLapse, iTimeLapse Pro, iMotion, and OSnap!. Some of these apps even have other features like letting you shoot stop motion videos or add audio."

They are easiest to connect to an intervalometer (or even have one built in) and have the most options of settings that you can adjust for shooting in all kinds of scenarios. DSLR stands for Digital Single-Lens Reflex. These types of cameras offer the most bang for your buck and are far and away the best option on the market for photographers who want to take professional photos."

          "description":"The whole point of a time lapse video is to see movement sped up over time. Walk around the area to find the best framing and composition for your shot. Pick somewhere to shoot that will have lots of interesting movement to capture for your time lapse video. For example, a sky with lots of moving clouds, a busy intersection, crowds of people, a sunrise, or a sunset are all good options for time lapse videos. Keep the \u201crule of thirds\u201d in mind when picking the location to frame your shot. In other words, look at the frame of your shot as a grid of 9 squares. Try to compose it so that the most interesting parts are at the intersections of the squares on this imaginary grid."

        {
          "headline":"Select a stable tripod to hold your camera steady while shooting.",
          "description":"You need a heavy tripod that won't shake in the wind. This will ensure that your camera stays as still as possible while shooting your time lapse so all the shots are the same. Your camera will be in the same position for up to 2 hours, so make sure to use the heaviest tripod you can get your hands on. While shooting, you can stabilize your tripod even further by hanging your camera bag from it or placing rocks around the legs to hold them in place."

A large and fast memory card will reduce the buffer time to allow your camera to quickly process each image before the next shot. The shorter your intervals between shots, the more important this is."

          "description":"Battery grips let you use 2 batteries at the same time. Your battery will drain much faster during time lapse photography, so having 2 batteries connected at once will help you avoid having to change the battery while shooting. If you don't have or can't use a battery grip for your camera, then at least carry a fully-charged spare battery that you can quickly swap into the camera if the battery dies during your shoot."

If you don't have an ND filter, you can experiment with underexposing shots by 1-2 stops, but this will decrease some of the image quality and you will have to recover it in editing."

Focus the lense to infinity if you are using a wide angle lens, or focus on specific elements in other cases. For example, if you are shooting a sky with moving clouds, then manually adjust the lens so that the clouds are fully in focus. If you are shooting at an intersection, then adjust the lens so that the cars at the intersection are most in focus."

Get a remote intervalometer that is compatible with your camera if it doesn't have a built-in one. Some built-in intervalometers have the advantage that they let you program a start time, so you could even begin shooting when you are not right next to the camera."

          "description":"Use a longer interval for slow moving subjects and a shorter interval for fast moving subjects. 1-5 seconds is a good general interval range for most time lapse subject matter. Use 1-second intervals for fast moving subjects such as traffic or fast moving clouds. Use a 3-5 second interval for things like slower moving clouds, crowds of people, sunsets, and sunrises. Longer intervals of 15-30 seconds can be used to shoot things over longer periods of time, like the sun moving across the sky or construction projects. Keep in mind that it takes about 1 hour to shoot enough images for a 30-second time lapse video at 5-second intervals, so a 30-second video shot at 30-second intervals would take you 6 hours to shoot. For extremely slow moving subjects, such as growing plants, use intervals of 10 minutes or more."

Set your intervalometer to capture the required number of frames at the chosen intervals, click \u201cstart\u201d, and leave it alone for the whole time it is shooting. For example, if you want to make a 20-second video of traffic at a busy intersection, then you would need to shoot 500 frames. Since you would be using 1-second intervals for this type of movement, it would only take you 500 seconds to get all the footage you need for your 20-second video. If you don't know how many frames you need or want, then set your intervalometer to \u201cinfinity\u201d so it will just keep shooting until you stop it. If you want to do heavy editing, then it's a good idea to take an extra 100-200 frames to give you some extra to work with."
