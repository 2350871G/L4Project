          "description":"Fabric stabilizers hold your fabric rigid so it's easier to sew, leading to less fraying. Pick out a stabilizer in a spray form to spray onto your fabric and make it rigid, or choose a fabric stabilizer that comes in the form of another fabric material that you cut away from your project. Select a stabilizer that's right for your project. For example, spray stabilizers can be washed off to be removed completely, while cut-away stabilizers are great for stretchy fabrics or knits. Avoid using a wash-away stabilizer if you can\u2019t wash your fabric. Cut-away stabilizers are cut into the same shape as your fabric, sew together, and then cut off using scissors once you're done with your project. There are also stabilizers you use by applying heat, ironing the stabilizer onto your piece of fabric."

For a super precise cut, line the zig-zag pattern up with each cut so that it's even.The zig-zag helps prevent your fabric from fraying and is great for cotton fabrics especially. Purchase pinking shears from your local craft or big box store."

Squeeze the glue out along the entire edge of the fabric in a straight line. Run your finger along the fabric's edge to smooth it out and create an even application.Fray Check is the most popular glue for fabric that prevents fraying. Clear coat nail polish works well as an alternative to Fray Check and is used the same way."

          "description":"Interfacing is a white material that's attached to fabric to help stiffen it up. Cut the interfacing to be the same shape as your cut-out fabric and lay it on top of the fabric evenly. Either iron it on to the fabric or sew it in place, depending on which type of interfacing you choose. When you sew your fabric to other pieces of fabric, position the interfacing so it's inside and hidden from view.For the best results, choose interlacing that's the same weight or thickness as your fabric so that they go together well. The interfacing lets you sew your fabric more easily because you can hold it in place without the fabric being flimsy."

Place the bias tape on the fabric you'd like to keep from fraying so that half the width of the tape is overlapping the fabric's edge. Use a needle and thread or a sewing machine to sew the bias tape to the edge of the fabric, either sewing one straight line down the middle of the tape or sewing the two long edges of the tape.Bias tape comes in lots of different colors, as well as a single fold and a double fold."

Use a sewing machine to make the process super easy, or do it by hand by looping the thread in circles into the edge of the fabric.The overcast stitch works best on fabrics that are thick.

Sew along the edge of the fabric again, this time with the seam out of view.This stitch will hide the edges so that they can't fray and is best for sheer or lightweight fabrics. Try to push out the seam so it\u2019s as flat as possible before you sew it again."

This stitch is quite sturdy and is made up of lots of loops, keeping your fabric from fraying due to the detailed stitch. Look for a serger machine at your local craft or big box store. Practice serging on a scrap piece of fabric, following the instructions that come with your specific serger model. Serging works well on most fabrics."
