Their peak season begins in November and ends in March, making winter a great time to make preserved lemons. Meyer lemons are traditionally used in place of conventional lemons in this recipe because their thinner skin makes them easier to preserve properly. Look for lemons with firm, bright flesh. Don't buy lemons that are green and underripe, and avoid lemons with brown spots indicating they're past their prime. If you can't find Meyer lemons, you can preserve conventional lemons instead. It's still best to use lemons when they're in season, during the winter months, since the lemons will taste fresher."
