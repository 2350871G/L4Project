          "description":"This is a golden rule. Camellias do best in light shade that protects them from hot afternoon sun. This doesn't mean that they need total shade, just enough so that they don't bake in the sun. As a camellia grows, it can tolerate more sun. This is because a mature camellia will have a big canopy of leaves that will shade the roots and make sure they don't get too dried out by the sun. This also depends on what climate you are planting the camellia in. If you are in a climate that never gets very hot, then a camellia can cope with a spot with less shade."

          "description":"The more sheltered the camellia, the better the flowering will be. This is because the dehydration from winds any time of year can kill camellias, whether it be warm winds in the summer or cold winds in the winter. Try planting your camellia between 3 to 6 feet from your house. This will give it good protection from the wind. If you need to, erect a fence or trellis to divert direct wind away from your camellia plants. The lighter the flower color, the more protection from wind is needed."

The hole should be just a bit deeper than the root ball in the center but a few inches deeper than that around the edges. Keeping the hole shallow in the center will prevent the plant from sinking. Digging the hole deeper around the edges will give the plant's roots some looser soil to easily spread out into. Place the rootball in the hole, making sure the top is slightly above the soil level. It's important to keep the rootball 2\u20134 inches (5.1\u201310 cm) above the soil line because camellias are sensitive to being planted too deeply. Fill the rest of the hole with a mixture of top soil and organic material. Press the dirt around the plant down so that it is firmly in place. Slope the dirt up the sides to meet the top of the rootball, but don't cover the rootball with any soil. Then give the plant a deep watering. If the weather is dry, give a new plant a thorough watering every week until it is well established."

Use whatever mulch you have readily available but don't pile it more than a few inches high, no matter what you use. This can keep soil too wet and lead to root rot. Remember that the mulch should not touch the trunk of the plant. Mulch also adds new organic material to your soil. This will help to break up clay soil or add richness to sandy soil.

This will ensure lush growth and good flowering each season. There are other varieties too, where the plant is not a heavy feeder, and do not react well to over-stimulation. Do not fertilize after August. Interestingly, their bloom time is also their dormant period and so should not be fertilized then. Cottonseed meal and fish emulsion are good natural choices. Two or three feedings between April 1 and September 1 is all that is necessary. Contact your local extension service or camellia experts to get recommendations of fertilizers that work well in your specific area and for your specific variety of the plant. Fertilizers usually have three numbers on them, which tells you about the nutrients in it. The first number is for nitrogen, the second number is for phosphorus, and the third number is for potassium. If you want your camellia to increase in size because it is newly planted, give it a fertilizer with a larger first number, such as 10 or 12. If you just want to maintain the size of an already established plant, then a lower first number, such as 4, will work well."

If you've been overdoing the acidic fertilizing, stop now! If you test your soil, it should have a ph between 5.5 and 6.8 to make a camellia happy. If you notice the leaves turning yellow, the camellia likely needs more acid in the soil. Re-pot with fresh potting soil formulated for acid-loving plants."
