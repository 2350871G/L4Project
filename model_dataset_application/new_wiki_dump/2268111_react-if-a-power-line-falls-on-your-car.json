          "description":"Unless your car is on fire, it\u2019s very important to stay inside your car once a power line falls. When a power line falls on your car, it often charges the metal parts of the car with electrical current, meaning that if you attempt to exit as you normally do, you will be electrocuted. After the line falls, look around the inside of your car and out the windows. If you don\u2019t see flames or smoke, you aren\u2019t in any immediate danger. The safest thing you can do is to stay inside. If you see flames and smoke, refer to Method 2 for instructions on safely evacuating the car. If there are other passengers in the car, communicate with them that the safest thing to do is to stay inside the car. Even one person exiting the car incorrectly could put you all in danger of electrocution."
