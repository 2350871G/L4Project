          "description":"Reading and writing go hand-in-hand. Good writers are well read in variety of subjects and writing styles. Your child's teacher and local librarian can help you select books that are appropriate to your child's age and interests. In addition to reading to your child, have your child read to you if they are old enough. Ask your child questions about their favorite books. Why do they like some books and not others? Help them to develop their tastes as a reader and to be thoughtful about words, characters, settings, and plots. If your child has a favorite author or book series, you might also consider taking your child to see the author speak or to a book signing in order to inspire your child to write."

          "description":"Make sure your child's schedule isn't packed with other activities. Reading and writing take a lot of time and mental energy, so you cannot expect your child to write a story in between soccer practice and piano lessons. Let your child explore the world of words during times when they can relax, breathe, contemplate, and think freely."

          "headline":"Provide your child with a place and materials for creative writing.",
          "description":"Just as children should have a quiet place to study and do their other homework, the same is true for their writing assignments. Ideally, this would be a desk in the child's room, away from the television. If your child wishes to have privacy, be sure that you afford that to them: do not read over their shoulder unless they say you can. A child's writing area should include the following materials:\nA notebook or journal\nPens, pencils, and erasers\nA bookshelf to keep inspiration nearby\nAn age-appropriate dictionary\nA thesaurus. A thesaurus isn't necessary for very young children, but it can be helpful for older children who wish to expand their vocabularies."

          "headline":"Focus on creativity, not grammar.",
          "description":"If your child is to succeed as a creative writer, they must learn how to experiment, take risks, and think outside the box. Don't discourage your child's creativity by harping on about spelling, grammar, or punctuation. Feel free to gently correct these mechanical errors, but do not make your child feel like they have failed a homework assignment. Instead, praise creativity and talk to them about their ideas."

Encourage them to love creativity and writing by demonstrating your keen interest in their ideas, thoughts, and stories. Ask them questions about their stories that show that you were paying attention. Compliment your child when they have done something well, such as come up with an interesting character, write a funny plot, or use a difficult word correctly in a sentence."

Keep your child motivated to write by putting their stories up on the fridge or placing them on a bulletin board. You can also work with your child to make a special \"book\" out of their stories, including homemade illustrations and decorations. Stitch the book together with ribbon or yarn to create a special archive of their creativity."

          "description":"If your child is too young to write and spell out long stories, ask your child to come up with stories out loud. Write down your child's thoughts and read them back to your child. You can do this with very young children to help them learn to connect spoken and written words or with older children to help them focus."

Try to keep the story silly and light-hearted in order to keep your child interested and engaged. A few game ideas include:\nWrite a story by switching after each sentence. First you write a sentence, then your child continues with the next sentence, then you take over again, etc. Try to add unexpected surprises and goofy twists to keep the story fun and exciting. Draw a picture and ask your child to imagine a story behind the picture. Make a list of words by having you and your child point to random words in a dictionary.
