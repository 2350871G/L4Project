  "text":" Breaking in Jeans Without Washing Wear your jeans as much as possible. The oldest tried and true method of softening jeans is simply wearing them and letting the fibers stretch and soften. When you first buy jeans, wear them every day or at least as often as you can. They\u2019ll soften up faster if you wear them for a week straight than if you wear them once a week. Ride a bike while wearing the jeans. While the jeans will soften with normal wear, biking achieves an exaggerated effect.

For occasions when you don\u2019t get the jeans filthy, washing them every 5-10 times of wearing them is sufficient. You\u2019ll have to judge for yourself if they are actually dirty and ready to be washed. Washing New Jeans Turn your jeans inside out. Check the tag of your jeans to confirm this, but most jeans are supposed to be washed inside out. Since washing distresses the color and look of the jeans, turning them inside out reduces this a bit. Fill the washing machine with cold water. Although denim isn\u2019t going to shrink all that much, it\u2019s still best to wash new jeans with cold water.
