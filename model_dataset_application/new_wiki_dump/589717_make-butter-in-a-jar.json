If a little butter slips out when you're pouring out the buttermilk, do not worry. You can use a spoon to scoop it out of the container and place it back in the jar. As butter may slip out, do not drain the buttermilk over the sink. Even if you intend to discard the buttermilk, drain it into a container."
