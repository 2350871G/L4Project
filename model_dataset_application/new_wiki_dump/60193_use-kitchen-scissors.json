          "headline":"Break down meat by cutting it apart.",
          "description":"Scissors cut into slippery meats, including fish, and small spaces with less difficulty than knives. Stick the scissor tips into the belly of the fish near the tail. Cut along the belly to the head. Use the scissors to snip off the head along with the fins. You can then cleanly cut out the meat you want without dirtying a cutting board. For poultry, cut out the backbone or rib cage to open up the bird. Cut off the wings and thighs where they connect to the body. These joints are small, so it\u2019s easier to clip them with scissors instead of a knife. It\u2019s also easier to trim bacon into pieces with scissors."
        },

          "headline":"Shred fresh herbs and spices.",
          "description":"With kitchen scissors, there\u2019s little risk of slipping and cutting yourself. Leafy herbs such as basil and oregano are easily harvested by snipping the leaves off at the stems. To break down the leaves, place them in a bowl and cut away until they\u2019re as small as you want them. You\u2019ll get clean cuts without bruising the leaves. Solid herbs and spices like garlic and ginger are also very easy to cut into pieces with scissors."

          "headline":"Clip roots and stems off fruits and vegetables.",
          "description":"Leafy tops, such as on carrots and strawberries, can be clipped off without much of a struggle. Scissors also help in removing roots or woody stems on scallions and mushrooms. For broccoli, cut the florets off at the stem. The sharper blade can also be used to scrape off dark spots and other blemishes."

          "headline":"Trim dough after rolling it out.",
          "description":"Scissors are a handy tool in baking. After laying phyllo or puff pastry flat, trim it to size. The scissors make clean, even cuts. For pie dough, lay the dough in the pie tin and snip around the edges to remove the excess. Scissors are also a great way to form a lattice by cutting dough into a strip and laying it over the pie. Scissors also aid in precision cutting for pasta dough, such as when forming ravioli."

          "headline":"Cut food inside a can to avoid making a mess.",
          "description":"This is particularly useful for canned tomatoes, which are very messy when taken out of the can. Leave them in there and snip at them with the scissors until they\u2019re broken down into smaller pieces. Then you can pour them into a pan without losing any of the juice. This also works with other canned food, such as pineapple rings and peppers."

          "headline":"Trim bread into smaller pieces.",
          "description":"Scissors are perfect for making any food bite-sized, but they work especially well for bread. Trim around the crust to remove it cleanly, leaving the rest of the bread whole. Leftover bread can be clipped evenly into cubes for stuffing, bread pudding, croutons, or other recipes. Scissors also allow you to cut pitas into evenly-sized wedges. Scissors can even cut pizzas and quesadillas after they\u2019ve been cooked."

          "description":"These dried products are small and slippery, making them difficult to cut with a knife. Place them between the scissor blades and cut them in half. It\u2019s a no-hassle way to break down foods such as raisins or sun-dried tomatoes."

          "headline":"Cut open shellfish for quick cleaning.",
          "description":"Scissors and shears have grips between the handles, which are strong enough to crack open crab claws and lobster shells. The scissor blades are useful for cutting neatly through thinner shells, such as the ones on shrimp. With knives, this is difficult and you\u2019d also need a shell cracker. For shrimp, push the scissor blades under the shell. Cut along the vein, then peel off the shell by hand. The vein will also pop right out."
