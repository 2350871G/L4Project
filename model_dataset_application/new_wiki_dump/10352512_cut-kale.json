If you don't clean the kale straight away after you get home from the store or after you pull it from your garden, you run the risk of damaging the leaves. Over time, the dirt will wear away the leaves and ruin them. Pour cool water into a large bowl. You can use either tap water or distilled water to fill the bowl. Make sure the bowl is large enough to fit all the kale you want to clean. If you have loads of kale to clean, clean different batches at a time. The deeper the bowl is, the easier it will be for you to clean the kale. Wrap a rubber band around the kale and place it in the bowl. Grab a bunch of kale with your hand. Place the rubber band around the bunch to keep it all together while you prepare it. The rubber band should be tight enough to keep the bundle together but not so tight that it damages the leaves.

Put the bags in the fridge when you're ready. The kale should keep for about 1 week. Kale that's spoiled will feel soggy and won't smell fresh. Store cut kale in the fridge for up to 5 days.
