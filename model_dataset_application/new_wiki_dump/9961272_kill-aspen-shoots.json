It takes several months for the herbicide to work. The best time to use it is right before the weather starts to cool down, since the tree will be in a dormant period anyway. After the herbicide works, you'll need to chop down your tree. Treating it in the late summer or fall will allow you to chop down the dead tree in the spring."

Herbicides like Roundup or Brush Killer can spread through the root system, killing the tree. Choose a concentrated mix rather than a granular herbicide. You can purchase an herbicide at a gardening store or online. Follow the instructions on the label while handling herbicide, as it can be hazardous. When using herbicide, always wear the proper protective gear, such as gloves, safety goggles, long sleeves, and pants. Check the label on the product to ensure that you wear all that is recommended."

You may also desire to dig out the trunk and root system, especially if you want to replant something in the area."

To completely prevent future shoots, first apply a broadleaf herbicide to the cut stump, being careful to follow the directions on the product. The herbicide will travel to the existing roots and prevent growth. Drill holes into the stump and pour concentrated herbicide into them for extra strength. Hire a professional to grind and remove your stump completely. They will be trained to fully remove the stump and roots so you don\u2019t have to worry about it."
