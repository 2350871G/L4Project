For an average serving of twice-baked potatoes, you\u2019ll need 4-5 large russet potatoes, olive or canola oil, milk, butter, sour cream, bacon, sharp cheddar cheese and diced green onions. This recipe will serve approximately 8-10 people. Use more potatoes and increase the amount of other ingredients proportionately to serve more people."

Oiling the potatoes will allow them to cook faster, and will also make the skins crispy. Arrange the potatoes on a large baking sheet. The shells of twice-baked potatoes are packed with nutrients and can be eaten along with the rest of the potato, much like potato skins."

Since you\u2019ll be scooping out the contents of the potatoes to make the filling, they\u2019ll need to be done and slightly soft. The outside of the potatoes should give a little to the touch when they\u2019re fully cooked. Larger potatoes will need to cook longer, whereas smaller potatoes will get done faster. For this reason, it\u2019s better to test the potatoes by feel rather than simply timing them. To make the best use of your time, begin cooking the bacon, shredding the cheese, dicing the onion or preparing other dishes as the potatoes are baking."

When the potatoes have cooled sufficiently, use a sharp kitchen knife to cut each of them in half lengthwise and place them back on the baking sheet, skin-side down. Each potato will produce 2 twice-baked potatoes after it\u2019s been halved and stuffed."

Together, the dairy components will give the potatoes a creamy texture. You can add more butter or sour cream to taste, as long as you don\u2019t use enough to change the consistency of the filling.

Use a potato masher or electric hand mixer to combine the potatoes with the dairy ingredients. For best results, the mixture should be blended but still slightly chunky. Leave a small amount of potato in the shells to ensure that they\u2019re sturdy enough to withstand refilling and baking. Mash the ingredients more thoroughly or use an electric mixer on a higher setting to give the potatoes a smoother consistency.

Mash everything together again until the cheese has melted and the bacon pieces are evenly distributed throughout the filling. You can also use pre-cooked bacon bits if you\u2019re in a pinch, but the flavor and texture may not be as good as freshly cooked bacon. Set aside some cheese and bacon to add to the tops of the potatoes before baking them a second time, or simply grate or cook a little more."

The filling will be quite salty on its own due to the butter, bacon and cheese. Mix the ingredients together once more after seasoning. A little salt and pepper is all you\u2019ll really need to season the filling. Otherwise, you risk overpowering and losing the flavor of the potato."
