Did you have a venue in mind, like a specific restaurant, bowling alley, movie theater, or park? Make sure your location is suitable for the activities you may have planned. If you plan on having quite a few guests and can\u2019t do it at home, you may want to make reservations at your venue beforehand to make sure they can accommodate you.

Otherwise, any weekend evening or night is generally best so you and your guests don\u2019t have school or work in the morning. Most parties are after dinner, but a brunch or afternoon party works, too. Sleepover parties are also great fun but involve more thorough planning and entertainment. Also, make sure to pick a date when most of your guests are free. Do you know of another party happening or a community event or holiday that has everyone booked? You may have to do some asking around beforehand to figure out if this is the case. You may also want to have a duration of time for your party. That way when it hits midnight, your guests know that they don\u2019t have to go home, but they can\u2019t stay with you (or at the venue that\u2019s closing). It also helps people not have to worry about an unscheduled departure."

Whether it\u2019s leftover food, a cupcake, or a party favor, it\u2019s nice to have something for your guests to leave the party with \u2013 and it\u2019s less clutter for you to worry about. That way everyone leaves with a piece of the party, feeling like they were involved and had a good time. Make sure to tag everyone in all your photos, too, when all is said and done. People will be reminded of how fun your party was and be looking forward to your next one. What will the next party's theme be?",
