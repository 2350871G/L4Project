          "description":"Pour your rice into a pot. Then, add water until you've reached a 6:1 water-rice ratio. Place the lid on the pot. Let the rice sit in the water undisturbed for at least 6 hours. This soaking period helps to remove some of the contaminants, such as arsenic, from your rice."
        },

          "headline":"Rinse out the strained rice.",
          "description":"Once the 12 hours is up, pour the water from the pot out through a metal mesh strainer and into the sink. Once all of the water is removed, use a spoon to move a portion of the rice on to the strainer. Run tap water over the rice for 1 minute. Then, stop the water and let the rice drain before setting it aside. Repeat with the remaining rice. While soaking and rinsing can lower the arsenic levels in rice, it may also remove nutrients, such as folate and iron. Even with the nutrient loss, it's still worthwhile to prepare your rice in this way."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Add water to a clean pot in a 6:1 water-rice ratio.",
          "description":"As a general rule, add in 6 parts of water for every 1 part of rice in the pot. So, if you are cooking 1 cup (240 mL) of rice, then you'll need to pour in at least 6 cups (1,400 mL) of water. This water will help to leach out the arsenic while the rice cooks."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Bring the rice and water to a rolling boil for 30 minutes.",
          "description":"Once you've filled the pot, cover it with a lid and turn the heat up to its highest setting. Wait until the water begins to fully boil before turning the temperature slightly down. Your goal is to maintain a rolling boil for at least half an hour, while not burning the rice with too high of a temperature. It's fine to stir the rice with a spoon occasionally to keep it from sticking to the bottom of the pot. If you are cooking instant rice, then the boiling time might be significantly reduced. Follow the directions on the rice's package, but know that you may not be removing as much arsenic you could with non-instant rice types."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Drain the water from the rice.",
          "description":"Set up a colander in the sink. Then, carefully pour the rice and water into the colander. Stir the rice slightly to encourage all of the water to drain away."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Return the rice to its original pot for 10 minutes.",
          "description":"When you've drained away the water, pour the rice back in to the cooking pot. Let it sit unheated and undisturbed for at least 10 minutes. You can cover the pot if you'd like to retain some of the heat. Once this time is up, the rice is ready to serve and eat. This process will not remove all arsenic from the rice, but it will help to lower the levels substantially. Many people compare this type of cooking method to one that you commonly use to prepare pasta."

As a general rule, sushi rice from the U.S. and white basmati rice from California have lower amounts of arsenic. In addition, choosing rice grown in India or Pakistan can also reduce your arsenic exposure. For reasons that are difficult to pinpoint, the rice grown in these areas seems to absorb less arsenic from the soil during the growth process. In the United States, rice grown in the south central states, such as Texas, usually has higher inorganic arsenic levels."

          "description":"If you are simply trying to avoid arsenic, then white rice is the right choice since it doesn't contain the outer shell that brown rice does. The outer layers are where much of the arsenic accumulates. Brown rice has more arsenic as a result since the outer shell is still intact. However, it isn't wise to eliminate brown rice from your diet entirely, as it actually contains more nutrients than its white counterpart. A good compromise is to only eat brown rice from preferred locations, such as the U.S., Pakistan, or India. Basmati rice usually has lower arsenic levels as well. For example, Basmati brown rice grown in Arkansas has been shown to have at least 3% less arsenic than its white counterpart."

Consider how much rice you eat over the course of a week and aim to lower that amount by half or more. Stop buying rice when shopping and get other grains instead to reduce the temptation to cook with it. Look for recipes online that are grain-free or incorporate other types of grains, such as barley. For children, it's best to stay at or below 1.25 servings of rice each week. For adults, the weekly recommended amount is 2 servings. A serving is usually around .25 cups (59 mL) of rice.
