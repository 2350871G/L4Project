Select healthy rose plants that have sturdy-looking leaves and stems and don\u2019t show any signs of disease or pests. Look to see if any of the leaves have black spots, red leaves, or chew marks. These are all signs of disease or infestation."

Container rose bushes should receive a minimum of 4 hours of direct sunlight a day."

If you come across weeds or stones as you\u2019re digging, use a garden fork to turn the soil over and remove them. Pull up anything that won't allow the roses\u2019 roots to venture freely. If planting multiple shrubs, space them at least 2 to 3 feet (60 to 90 cm) apart to allow space for growth."

You can purchase well-rotted manure at your local garden store. Be sure the manure is at least 3-4 years old, since new manure can burn the roots of roses. Try to incorporate roughly a bucket full of manure per square meter of soil. Alternatively, you can use decomposed compost instead of manure."

Apply a 2 to 3 inch (5 to 7 cm) layer, and maintain this level throughout the plant\u2019s life. Use shredded bark mulch that has been properly processed to remove insects and diseases. Pre-packaged mulch that is sold at garden centers is the safest bet. It should state right on the bag that it has been composted or sterilized."

Then give it a good, long soak to encourage your Midnight Blue rose bush to develop deep water-seeking roots that will help it survive drier periods in the future. In a hot, dry climate where temperatures rise to 80 or 90 \u00b0F (27 or 32 \u00b0C) or higher, your roses should be given 6 to 8 gallons (22 to 30 L) each week. You may need to water your roses every two or three days. In a more moderate climate, you will most likely find that you only need to water your rose bush once a week. Three to four gallons (11 to 15 L) should be sufficient. To prevent fungal growth, water in the morning to allow the leaves adequate time to dry out during the day."

Begin feeding your Midnight Blue rose bush as soon as it\u2019s established in the spring (about 3-4 weeks after planting, or as soon as you see new growth on an older plant). Feed it a couple more times during the growing season \u2013 once after the first blooms form and then a final time around midsummer. Water your rose bush before giving it fertilizer. Do not give fertilizer to a thirsty plant. Follow the dosage guidelines on the product packaging. Excess doses can damage the plant. You can opt to sprinkle a slow-release granule feed on top of the soil instead. The nutrients will be taken down to the roots the next few times you water the plant."

Check the top inch of soil for moisture several times a week, and if it feels dry, saturate the soil with water. Ensure good drainage by putting the container up on feet. A layer of gravel at the bottom of the container can also help with drainage. If the rose outgrows the container it will need to be repotted into a larger one. Look for matted roots at the surface of the soil or roots growing out through the drainage holes."

You can also put mulch down around your plant to help stop weed growth. Try to avoid hoeing weeds around your roses, as rose roots tend to be close to the soil surface and can be damaged by the hoe. Avoid chemical weed killers as well, since these can also harm your rose bush."

Growth buds are small raised or discolored triangular shaped areas on the rose stem. They are where the new stem will grow. Pruning above an outer-facing growth bud encourages the roses to grow outward, rather than inward, which can reduce air circulation and lessen the visual appeal of the bush. Avoid pruning your new rose for the first two years after you have planted it. Your rose bush will only need to be pruned after it has developed old growth or mature stems. If you wish to maintain the same size rose bush each year, trim back about \u2153 of the plant. If you want it smaller, trim more, and for a larger plant, trim less."
