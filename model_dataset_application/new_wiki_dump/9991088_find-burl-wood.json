So, especially if you\u2019re hoping to find lots of burls in a single location, check first under heavily canopied areas near a water source. It\u2019s possible to find burls anywhere there are trees, however, since they can also be caused by things like broken limbs. Burls are essentially the \u201cscabs\u201d or \u201cscars\u201d of a tree."

          "description":"In some tree species, like redwoods, burls tend to appear near the base of the trunk. These burls are actually part of the redwood\u2019s reproductive process. With any tree species, also check areas of obvious damage, such as a broken-off limb. Harvesting burls from live redwoods is illegal in many areas, as it can cause lasting damage to the tree. In general, it\u2019s best never to harvest burls from any healthy tree. Instead, just look at the burls and appreciate their beauty!"

Some are the size of tennis balls or even smaller, while rare finds can be larger than a beach ball. If you see this kind of spherical protrusion, you've found yourself a burl! Less commonly, a single burl can protrude around the entire circumference of the trunk, looking a bit like a bark-covered ring on a bark-covered finger. These are often real prizes for woodworkers, since they have unique graining and coloring that can span the entire trunk section."

It\u2019s possible that a fungus or other disease that\u2019s causing a burl on one tree may be doing the same to others in the area. Any species of tree can develop burls. Generally speaking, though, larger trees are capable of producing larger burls."
