  "text":" Making the sourdough starter Put the two tablespoons of whole wheat flour in the 1/4 cup of water, in a plastic or glass cup. Mix with a non-metal utensil. Leave it on a windowsill, covered but not airtight for three days. You may have better luck if you add a little more water and flour each day. On the third day, sniff it. If it smells sour, you have a good starter! If it stinks, dump it out, wash that glass, and try again, maybe in a different part of the house. Making the sourdough batter When you get a good starter, get a large glass, glazed ceramic, or plastic bowl, and with a wooden or plastic (non-metal) spoon, mix 2 cups of water with enough flour to make a gooey mix. If it's too stiff to stir easily, add more water. Then stir in a tablespoon or more of your sourdough starter (adding all of it is OK too). Leave this in a warm but not hot place. Check your sourdough daily. When it smells good and sour, and gets more gooey in consistency, you're ready. This will happen overnight in warm areas, and it takes up to 3 days in a cold house. Add more water if necessary to make it a good consistency for pancakes. If you've never made pancakes before, don't worry, you'll get the hang of it after a few tries and you can't really go wrong. Making the pancakes Put the batter you will use for pancakes in a separate bowl. Set aside the original container to feed later (with flour and water) so you will have starter for your pancakes tomorrow. Take the batch you will use for pancakes and add 1/4 cup sugar, a teaspoon of salt, one egg, and a tablespoon of oil (none of these extra ingredients are necessary, but the salt and oil are recommended). Put some oil (if preferred, non-virgin olive oil) in a cast iron or non-stick griddle or pan, and heat on medium flame to where dropping a drop of water on it makes it spatter.  Add 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda to your batter and mix vigorously for about 15 seconds. Your batter will rise as the baking soda reacts with the acetic acid in the sourdough (this is also optional). For very sour pancakes, add less baking soda. For less sour pancakes, add more baking soda. Also realize that adding less soda will make your pancakes rise less, while adding more will make them very fluffy. Dump out some of your sourdough \"batter\" into the pan. Let it pan fry for a minute or two. Hopefully it will flatten out nicely, like a pancake! If not, thin your batter some more before you try the next one... but continue with this one, all is not lost. When the top is bubbling, flip the pancake with a spatula. This takes some practice.
