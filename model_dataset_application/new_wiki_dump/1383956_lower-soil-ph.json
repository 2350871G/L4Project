          "description":"Many types of organic matter, like compost, composted manure, and acidic mulches can gradually lower your soil pH over time. As organic matter decomposes, bacteria and other microbes grow and feed upon it, creating acidic by-products in the process. Because organic matter needs time to decompose to alter the soil, this option is great for long-term goals, but won't give you dramatic results in the short-term. Many gardeners opt to add organic matter to their soil annually for a gradual, mild pH-lowering effect. However, this will not work for heavy clay soils. Organic matter can also give your soil other benefits \u2014 most noticeably, improving its drainage and aeration."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Add aluminum sulfate.",
          "description":"For rapid pH-lowering, don't rely on the slow, gradual decay of organic matter. Instead, use one of the many acidic soil additives available at your local garden supply store. Of these additives, aluminum sulfate, is one of the quickest-acting options available. Aluminum sulfate produces acidity in the soil as soon as it dissolves, which, for gardening purposes, means that it basically works instantly. Because of this, aluminum sulfate is a great choice for urgent pH lowering. Depending on the starting pH of your soil, the amount of aluminum sulfate you should use can vary significantly. In very general terms, you should expect to use about 1.2 pounds of aluminum sulfate to lower the pH of a 10-square foot patch of soil by one on the pH scale (e.g., from 7.0 to 6.0, from 6.0 to 5.0, etc.). However, using too much additive can be harmful to your plant, so consult an online resource (like the one here) for more precise usage information. Do not use aluminum sulfate for large applications because it can lead to aluminum accumulation and aluminum toxicity in soil."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Add sulfur.",
          "description":"Another useful pH-lowering soil additive is sublimed sulfur. Compared to aluminum sulfate, sulfur is generally cheaper, more powerful (in terms of the amount needed) and slower-acting. This is because sulfur needs to be metabolized by bacteria in the soil to be converted to sulfuric acid, which takes time. Depending on the moisture of the soil, the amount of bacteria present, and the temperature, sulfur can take up to several months to produce a noticeable effect in the soil. As noted above, compared to aluminum sulfate, you will generally need a relatively small amount of pure, sublimed sulfur to produce an equivalent pH change. In general, you'll need about 0.2 pounds of sulfur to lower the pH of a 10-square foot patch of soil by one whole number on the pH scale. Consult an online resource (like the one here) for more precise usage information."

        {
          "headline":"Add sulfur-coated urea.",
          "description":"Like sulfur and aluminum sulfate, soil additives containing sulfur-coated urea can increase the acidity of soil over time (lowering its pH). As an additive, urea is fairly quick-acting, producing some effects as soon as a week or two after being introduced to the soil. Sulfur-coated urea is a common ingredient in many fertilizers, so if you were already planning on fertilizing your plants, you may want to save yourself the trouble of finding a separate soil additive by simply picking a fertilizer containing this type of urea. Sulfur-coated urea content will vary from fertilizer to fertilizer, so consult the instructions that come with your fertilizer to determine the right amount to use for your gardening needs. Sulfur-coated urea is a slow-release fertilizer that doses nutrients out slowly as your plants need them, rather than distributing them all at once."

The time and amount needed can vary greatly for each, so consult the additive packaging or talk to an experienced employee at the gardening supply store.

          "description":"If your soil is too alkaline (basic) to grow plants which require acidic soil, raising alkaline-loving plants can gradually lower the pH of your soil over the life of the plant. As the plant grows, matures, and decays, the organic matter that returns to the soil will promote the growth of bacteria and gradually lower the pH level of the soil (similar to how adding organic matter in the form of mulch or manure). This method is generally one of the slowest ways to lower your soil pH, as the plant must grow to begin depositing organic matter in the soil. A few examples of alkaline-tolerant plants:\nCertain evergreen shrubs (e.g., boxwoods, California lilacs)\nCertain deciduous shrubs (e.g., lilacs, mock oranges, Forsythia species)\nCertain perennials (e.g., picks, hellebores)"

These plants are often native to areas with a high amount of rainfall, like the Pacific Northwest region of the United States (frequent rainfall generally lowers soil pH). For these types of shrubs, a pH range of about 4.5 - 5.5 is optimal. However, pH levels as high as 6.0 are usually acceptable."

For some of these flowers, changing a soil acidity from slightly acidic to very acidic can produce a visible change in the bloom color. For instance, growing a hydrangea in soil with a pH level of about 6.0 - 6.2 will produce a plant with pink flowers, while lowering the pH  level to about 5.2 - 5.5 will produce a plant with purple/blue flowers. The blue color of low-pH hydrangeas comes from the chemical aluminum.
