Give it a try by inserting a chisel, putty knife, or other flat tool in between the tile and the wall, almost parallel to the wall. Tap the handle of the tool with a hammer until the tile comes away from the wall. You may need to pry it off in two or three places if firmly attached. If the tiles break instead of coming away, try an air chisel instead. Have an assistant wearing leather gloves catch the tiles as they come away, before they fall. The first tile is generally much harder than the rest. Take your time to tap out the first one, then attack the exposed edge of the next tile. Make sure to be very careful near the edges because the tile will chip easily."
