For instance, if the invitation is addressed to \u201cMiss Janette,\u201d don\u2019t write \u201cMiss Jan\u201d on the line even if that\u2019s what you usually go by. If you\u2019re married and have the same last names, write your partner\u2019s first and last name after each of your titles. For example, \u201cMr. and Mrs. Seth Haverty.\u201d If you and your spouse have different last names, include both of your full names.

If there is more than one person going to the wedding, put each person\u2019s initials next to their preference so the servers know which plate goes where. If you\u2019re vegetarian or vegan and do not see vegetarian or vegan options, kindly contact the couple or venue (who can refer you to the caterer) to see if there are any options for you. Only contact the couple if you\u2019re close, and don\u2019t be pushy about it! If you know you won\u2019t be able to eat anything at the wedding due to dietary restrictions or severe allergies, plan to eat beforehand or bring your own meal and snacks. It might seem awkward, but people will understand your not wanting to burden the wedding party, caterers, or venue. If you do end up bringing a meal, spoon it onto a plate instead of eating it out of tupperware to match the formality of the evening."
