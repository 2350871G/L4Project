          "description":"Flip the pineapple over and sniff the stem end. A sweet scent is generally considered the most important aspect of choosing a ripe pineapple. If it has no scent, it's probably not ripe. You can try smelling the pineapple from other sides; a sweet enough scent may be distinguishable from any side of the fruit. You should still be able to smell the scent from the stem end, however, where it will likely be strongest. Avoid pineapples that smell fermented. Although you want the pineapple to smell sweet, you do not want it to be so ripe that the sweet smell has an alcoholic or vinegar-like taint to it."

If a larger pineapple feels just as heavy as a slightly smaller one, the smaller one is probably a better pick."

You are looking for a fresh pineapple, not a rotting one. The stem is the area of the pineapple that feeds sugar to the fruit. It is from here that the pineapple changes color.

For instance, if you live in California, Hawaiian or Mexican pineapples will probably be the freshest because they traveled the shortest distance from the plantation to your supermarket. Keeping It Fresh Eat a whole pineapple stored at room temperature within a few days. As long as you do not cut the pineapple, it should stay fresh for several days. Do not leave cut pineapple out in a room temperature setting, however, since it will spoil after a few hours. Refrigerate your pineapple to keep it fresh longer.
