  "text":" Alum formula In a large pan, mix 1 lb of alum with 1 pint hot water from a faucet. A preserving pan is a good size for this, to allow room for the fabric. Select the fabric that you wish to treat. Dip it into the pan and wet it completely. Pull out the completely wet fabric. Put into a non-drip plastic basket to take outside. Hang on a line, over the basket, or over a clothes rack. Use once dried. Expect some stiffness compared to the original fabric but it should mold to the shape needed with bending. Ammonium chloride and ammonium phosphate formula In a large pan, mix 1 cup ammonium chloride with 2 pints of water.  Add 1/2 cup ammonium phosphate and mix together.  Dip the fabric into the pan and completely cover as above. Dry as above. Borax formula Mix 6 parts/lbs borax, 5 parts/lbs boric acid, 100 parts/12 gallons (45.4 L) water in a large container.  Dip the fabric in until completely soaked. Repeat if needed. Allow to dry. Another borax variant Mix 7 parts/7lbs borax, 3 parts/3 lbs boric acid, 100 parts/12 gallons (45.4 L) water in a large container.  Follow above steps.
