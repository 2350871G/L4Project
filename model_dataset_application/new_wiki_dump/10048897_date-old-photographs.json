          "description":"If your image has people in it, their hairstyles and clothing styles can be an indicator of the time period. Take a look at clothing catalogs and photographs with known dates. These can help you narrow down a timeframe for your image. Remember that things like style can be regional, so look for images of people from similar regions or spheres of cultural influence. By the time photography was invented, women\u2019s dress was typically more period-specific and evolved faster. If you have a woman in your image, look at her dress and style first, as this may offer a more narrow time frame. Sources like national archives for different nations, the Library of Congress photo collections, and digitized museum archives may be good places to start looking for comparable images."

If your image shows an early phone, for example, your image would have to date to after 1878, when the first phone companies were founded and telephones became publicly accessible. Items like bicycles, toys, and cookware can also be great indicators of the time period for an old image. Check online or look through old department store catalogs to help you place specific types and models."

The Cordoba Fighting Dog, for example, was bred out in favor of the Dogo Argentino by the 1920s. A photo with a dog of that breed, then, would have to come before the 20\u2019s. Exotic plants, likewise, can be an indicator of the time period. If you see a plant like a palm tree that seems conspicuously out of place for the presumed time period, search online to see when that plant species was first imported into the area."

These images may also disappear and reappear depending upon the angle at which they are viewed. Daguerreotypes date from the 1840s to the 1850s.

Instead of being printed on metal, though, they were printed on glass plates with a thin coat of iodized collodion, which produced a black back. This helped eliminate the reflective characteristic of the daguerreotype. Daguerreotypes were popular starting in the early 1850s but lost favorability by the mid-1860s."

The plates for the tintype were typically thinner than the ambrotype glass plates, and often had rough edges. Tintypes gained popularity starting in the mid-1850s and remained the major image type until the late 1870s. However, they were still available up through the early 20th century as a novelty. Early tintypes were commonly stored in glass-framed cases, but later ones were held in cardboard sleeves."

Cartes de Visite were typically around 2.5 inches (64 mm) by 4 inches (100 mm), while cabinet cards were generally larger and may have the photographer\u2019s logo or signature on the reverse side. Carte des Visites came about in the 1850s, but gained a big boost in popularity around the early to mid-1860s, around the time of the American Civil War.
