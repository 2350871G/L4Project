  "text":" Drawing the basic shape Draw a circle slightly to the left of the page. This will be the basic shape for Scourge the Hedgehog's head. Draw two intersecting lines, one vertical and one horizontal line that bend to the contour of the sphere. Draw the horizontal line low on the circle, and draw the vertical close to the left edge. These will be construction lines that will help you place Scourge the Hedgehog's features later on. Draw two triangles on top of his head, which will be Scourge the Hedgehog's ears. Draw the left triangle on the top left side of his head, and draw the right one inside his head. Draw in the guide for Scourge the Hedgehog's eyes by drawing a wavy line that begins at the left ear, curves down toward the horizontal construction line, curves back up toward the right ear and finally dips down and rests on top of the horizontal construction line. The completed shape will resemble an S on its side. Draw Scourge the Hedgehog's nose as a tilted oval placed near the point at which the two construction lines cross. Draw the nose so it extends beyond the edge of the main circle. Lightly sketch his shades slightly lower than where his eyes will be. Draw in a cheek line by making a backward C-shaped curve below the wavy line of his eyes. To the left of this line, draw a tilted letter D shape for Scourge the Hedgehog's mouth. Sketch in basic guides for the spikes on the back of Scourge the Hedgehog's head by drawing three triangles. Draw one spike on the top right of his head, and make it slightly graze the tip of the right ear. Draw the middle spike slightly pointing down, and make the last one point down and end touching the bottom part of his cheek line. Adding details Add details. That's it for the initial sketch of Scourge the Hedgehog from the Archie comic books! You have the basic Scourge the Hedgehog shape, so now go in and tighten your drawing. From this point on, press harder with your pencil in order to get darker lines and a more defined sketch. Tighten the shape of Scourge the Hedgehog's nose. Draw it skinnier the closer it gets to his face. Using the shape of his head and the horizontal construction line as guides, draw in Scourge's snout. It almost looks like a hot dog. Tighten Scourge the Hedgehog's mouth by curving it more and drawing a laugh line on top. Inside his mouth, draw a curve near the top for his teeth and one below for his tongue. Darken the wavy line that makes Scourge the Hedgehog's eyes, but draw an extra line in the middle to represent his furrowed brow. Above each of Scourge's eyes, draw a large curve to represent the rest of his brow. Draw the curve on the left so it comes out of the main circle a bit. Finish drawing Scourge the Hedgehog's eyes by closing the part of the main circle below his left brow. On the right sides of his eyes, draw three long ovals inside each other and shade the middle one in. These will be his irises, pupils and glare. A large portion of the eye on the left will be hidden by Scourge's brow. Tighten the shape of Scourge the Hedgehog's ears. Draw them more round so that they won't be so pointy. Draw a triangle like shape within the right ear to represent the inside part of Scourge's ear. Using the triangle spikes on Scourge's head as guides, tighten the spikes on his head. Draw them so they curve down and slightly overlap each other. That's it! You now have a nice sketch of Scourge the Hedgehog from the Archie comic books.
