Split the dates in half and pull out the large seeds to use in the germination process. It\u2019s best to use at least 4-5 date seeds just in case they don\u2019t all germinate.

Check on your seeds after the 2 weeks are up, unwrapping the paper towel carefully. Look for white roots growing from the seeds to show that they\u2019re ready to be moved into the soil. Potting the Date Seed Fill a small pot with palm soil or other well-draining nutrients. Pick out a container that\u2019s at least 5 in (13 cm) wide and fill it with nutrient-rich potting soil. Use soil that has a mix of sand, vermiculite, and peat moss in it and fill the pot up about three-fifths of the way full. Choose a container that has holes at the bottom so the water can drain out. A great sand and vermiculite ratio for the soil is 1:4 or 1:3. Peat moss is good for encouraging draining in your plant. Make small indentations 2 in (5.1 cm) apart from one another in the soil. Press your finger down into the soil to form the hole, making it 1 cm (0.39 in) to 1 in (2.5 cm) deep. Spread the holes out roughly 2 in (5.1 cm) from each other so the seeds have enough space to grow. Place each seed into a hole and cover them up with soil.
