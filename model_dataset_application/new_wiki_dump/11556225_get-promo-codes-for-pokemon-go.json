      "description":"Many users report receiving a promo code from Niantic after remaining logged out of the game for an extended period of time. The amount of time may vary, but some users report it can take up to a year. To trigger an email with a code for a few items from Niantic, you'll need to log out of the game and not log in for a while. If you don't log out, but just close the app, it'll run in the background and you won't receive a code. To log out, open Pok\u00e9mon Go, tap the Pok\u00e9 Ball in the center of your screen, then tap Settings, and then tap Sign Out near your username."
