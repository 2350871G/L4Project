This will allow any chlorine in the water to break down, because chlorine will kill the beneficial bacteria in the compost tea. You don't have to aerate the water if you're using well water or another water source that doesn't contain chlorine."

You'll attach this to an external pump, which will keep the tea moving as it brews. Make sure the pump you use is capable of moving at least 5 gallons (19 L) of water. The pump system is necessary to aerate the compost tea as it brews. Stagnant tea will become anaerobic, and this won't be good for your plants."

Add \u215b teaspoon (0.6 ml) of vegetable oil and shake the mixture. Spray the tea mixture onto leaves in the early morning or late evening. The vegetable oil will help the tea stick to the leaves. Always use diluted tea on young or delicate plants. Don't spray plants with foliar spray in the middle of the day, as the sun can burn the leaves."
