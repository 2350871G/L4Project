  "text":" Simple fort Make this fort at the end of your bed. At the end of your bed, tape a sheet or blanket to the frame. In the middle of the sheet/blanket, put a high but sturdy object such as a standing lamp or, even better, a bar stool.  Put two similar height low objects such as upright standing suitcases. Tape or use a clothespin to hold the sheet/blanket on. Attach extra sheets/blankets to the floor for extra hiding.  Leave a small gap for you to leave and enter your fort with ease. Happy hiding! Finished.  Blanket fort using a bunk bed Push your bunk up against the wall or in a corner is better. For privacy, the darker the corner, the better. Hang as many blankets down the exposed sides as you can fit. The more, the better! Ensure that there is no area left uncovered. Furnish with blankets and pillows.  Place a box of books, games etc. inside for entertainment. Finished.  Tension rod fort Obtain a tension rod. For this, either a shower or a curtain tension rod will work. You'll also need a flat twin sheet (or perhaps two) and 2 to 4 food package clips. Choose a spot to set up the fort. It is best placed between two hard-to-move objects. These objects could be a wall, bed head/foot board, large dresser, bookshelf, entertainment center, etc. Untwist the tension rod. Secure it between the two objects. This is done the same way as you would mount the tension rod in a shower. Drape the sheet (or sheets) over the rod. Drape it so that the midpoint of the sheet is covering the tension rod and the top and bottom ends are pointed towards the floor. Use a food package clip to secure the sheet in place. Pinch the sheet just under the rod so that it forms a temporary pocket for the sheet to slide securely without slipping out of place. Help set up the nook with whatever your little one desires. Add cushions, pillows, a flashlight, books, etc.",
