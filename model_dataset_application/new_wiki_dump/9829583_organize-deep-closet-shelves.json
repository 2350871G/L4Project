          "description":"A large, deep closet probably contains items used in each season. On each shelf, combine items that are used together in a specific season. So, as summer turns into fall, fill a small plastic container with your sunscreen, sunglasses, and small pool toys. Label this \u201cSummer Pool,\u201d and house it in the back of the closet. Or, if winter is over and spring has arrived, fill a plastic container with winter scarves, hats, gloves, and mittens.

After working with Caitlin, her client\u2019s have an increase in their confidence and style and a decrease in stressful mornings. Her work has been featured in VoyageLA, Liverpool Los Angeles, and the Brother Snapchat Channel. Caitlin Jaymes\t\t\tCloset Organizer & Fashion Stylist\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: When you're organizing your closet shelves, think about your lifestyle and the items you use more frequently. However, you should also consider what you really love, and put that toward the front of your closet. For instance, if you wear a suit to work every day but you really hate wearing a suit, you wouldn't necessarily put that at the front of your closet. You want to feel inspired and excited every time you go into your closet to get dressed."

The depth of the closet will work to your advantage in this instance: you can add additional boxes farther back in the closet as your printed photographs continue to accumulate. Be sure to label the boxes so you know what photos are inside. For example, \u201cWinter 2000\u201d or \u201c1993 trip to Tahoe.\u201d"

So, in a container labeled \u201cVehicle Supplies,\u201d you could combine leather cleaner, oil, windshield washer fluid, and cleaning rags. If you were to put loose items into the back of a deep closet, they\u2019d likely get lost over time or become impractically disorganized. You can purchase various sizes of plastic containers at a local home-supply store. Also check hobby shops or craft stores."

Have a separate container labeled \u201cLightbulbs,\u201d and fill it with spare bulbs for your lights.
