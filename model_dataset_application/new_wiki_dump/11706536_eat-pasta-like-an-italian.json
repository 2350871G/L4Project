It's considered insulting to the chef because excessive cheese will overpower the other flavors in the dish. Certain cheeses pair well with certain sauces. For instance, use parmigiano-reggiano for creamy sauces, pecorino romano for oil-based sauces, or ricotta for cream-less sauces. However, this isn\u2019t a strict rule because parmigiano will also go on just about anything!"

For instance, if you're cooking 16 oz (454 g) of noodles, you'll use 169 fluid ounces (5,000 mL) of water and 10.5 tsp (52 g) of salt. Do not pour olive oil into the water\u2014it will only prevent the sauce from sticking to the noodles later on.

Al dente noodles will bend over the fork as you lift it out of the water but still hold a structured bend (that is, it won't bend so much that it's flat against either side of the fork).

If the noodles are soft yet still slightly firm and chewy, they\u2019re perfect! For tube-shaped noodles, look for a thin white ring around the inside. For stringy noodles, look for a white dot in the center when you bite through one end. If the noodles are mushy, they're overcooked. You can still eat them but it won't have an authentic al dente Italian taste. If it has a slight crunch to it, let them cook for 20 seconds longer before taste-testing again. You can\u2019t un-cook noodles, so when in doubt, it\u2019s best to take them out sooner rather than later."

As an alternative, spoon 2 spoonfuls of cooking water into the sauce before pouring all of the noodles into the colander.
