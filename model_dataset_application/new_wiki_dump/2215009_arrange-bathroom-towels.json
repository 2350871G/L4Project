Hang your larger towels across the middle and upper rungs. Smaller towels can go closer to the bottom. To ensure that the ladder doesn\u2019t slip across the bathroom floor, attach rubber tips made for chair legs to the feet of the ladder. To make the ladder even more secure, attach the top to the wall with hooks and eyes."

Position the coat rack near the tub or shower to make sure that the towels are close by when they are needed. The hooks can be used for other bathroom necessities, like loofahs or robes.
