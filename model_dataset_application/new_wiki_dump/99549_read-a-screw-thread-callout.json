In the Unified Thread Standard (UTS) system, manufacturers list the diameter size as a number between 0 and 10, with 0 being the smallest and 10 being the largest. Screws larger than a #10 have a diameter listed directly in inches. For example, on a #4-40 UNC-3A x .5 screw, #4 represents the diameter. It has a diameter of  0.112 in (0.28 cm). The diameter is sometimes listed as a fraction, such as \u00bc. It has a diameter of \u20444 in (0.64 cm). To help decipher the number ratings, look up a conversion chart online."

Coarse screws also have a larger pitch measurement than fine screws. A #4-40 UNC-3A x .5 screw has 40 threads per inch. A \u00bc-20 screw, by comparison, only has 20 threads."

The most common one is UNC, which means Unified National Coarse. You may also see Unified National Fine (UNF) and some other standards. If you see a callout like #4-40 UNC-3A x .5, the UNC tells you that you have a coarse screw. UNC or coarse screws are the most common type and used for general purposes. UNF or fine screws have a smaller pitch, making them stronger and more resistant to damage, such as from vibration. You may also see a J, like UNJC or UNJF. These screws are bigger and even stronger than regular screws."

          "description":"If the callout includes the tolerance class, it is telling you what kind of nuts or holes the screw is meant to fit into. A size 1 screw has the most space between its threads, so it fits more loosely when it is used. Size 3 is the tightest fit and used for accuracy. Size 2 screws are the ones you will end up working within most cases. Note that the tolerance class is also divided into A and B. For instance, you might see 2A and 2B screws, which are slightly different sizes. A represents the external threads on the screw shaft and B represents the internal ones. For instance, a callout of #4-40 UNC-3A x .5 corresponds to a 3A screw. This kind of screw is used for tight fits. If you plan on securing a screw with a nut, find one with a matching tolerance class."

Left-handed screws are often used when right-handed screws would normally come loose, such as on bicycle pedals and other rotating parts. For example, #4-40 UNC-3A x .5 is not a left-handed screw. A left-handed version would be labeled like #4-40 UNC-3A-LH x .5. Most screws you use at home will be right-handed screws. However, if you find a screw marked with LH, you will know to turn it in the opposite direction!"

Most screws are measured from the end of the shaft to the bottom of the head. However, note that flathead screws, designed to sit flush when placed, are measured from the top of the head. For unified threads, the length is given in inches. A #4-40 UNC-3A x .5 screw is 0.5 in (1.3 cm) long.
