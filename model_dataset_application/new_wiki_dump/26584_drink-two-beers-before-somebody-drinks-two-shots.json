However, if you see strangers who look like they can take a joke, go for it. Avoid bothering bikers, surly-looking regulars, or anyone else who looks like they won't react well to losing a bet.

This part is important \u2014 if you don't explain the rules clearly, you'll probably get some angry complaints and a refusal to pay up. The bet works as follows:\nYou will order two beers and your opponent will order two shots. To win, you must drink both beers before your opponent can drink the shots. If anyone isn't drinking, feel free to substitute soda or water for alcohol. Neither person can touch the other's drinks or glasses. Both people must drink only one drink at a time \u2014 no touching the second drink until the first is finished. Your opponent must give you a one beer head start. In other words, s/he must wait until you finish your first beer before s/he drinks the first shot."
