This way, it'll still be somewhat cool out and the plant will have some time to recover before the hottest point of the day. If you cut late in the day, you might weaken and hurt the plant."

          "description":"Mid-bloom is when half of the red clover plants in a given location (a field, your garden, or yard) have at least one flower. Harvesting at this point should yield sweet red clover flowers and leaves. This should not hurt yields for later harvests. The first mid-bloom of the year will typically be in the spring."

Cutting at or after full bloom could harm the plant and potentially lower yield for the following season. As a result, if you plan to continually harvest a particular red clover patch, you should not harvest late into a bloom."

To do this, place wire racks or trays with leaves and flowers in a shaded area. Then, allow them to turn crisp. Make sure wherever you lay your harvest is not too moist or humid.
