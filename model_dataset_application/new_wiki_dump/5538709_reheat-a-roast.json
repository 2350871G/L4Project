Roasts can dry out in the reheating process, so you'll want to save any fats or fluids that drip off the roast into the baking pan. You should also cook the roast slightly less done than you prefer. For example, if you prefer a medium rare roast, remove your roast from the oven when it's rare. Collect the drippings after removing the roast from the oven. You can pour the drippings into a sealable container and store them in the fridge for later."
