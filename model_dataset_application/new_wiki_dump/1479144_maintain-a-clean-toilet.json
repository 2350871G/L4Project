  "text":" Cleaning Inside the Bowl Add toilet cleaner or other household cleaner to the inside of the bowl and beneath the rim then allow it to work for a few minutes. There are many products available that cling to the sides of the bowl rather than running quickly down. Using a toilet brush, scrub the interior bowl until clean. Sprinkle baking soda all around the sides of the inner bowl for a more natural, non-chemical clean. Allow it to work for approximately 5 minutes then scrub with a toilet brush. Baking soda is an inexpensive, non-toxic, naturally-occurring material that is effective in cleaning and whitening without harsh chemicals. This is a safer option for households with dogs who may drink from the bowl or potty-training children who touch the toilet frequently. Cleaning Outside the Bowl Spray a household cleaner around the outside of the bowl, lid and seat then wipe with a paper towel or clean rag. When finished, wipe the floor around the base of the toilet to catch any over-spray and to prevent slipping. Wipe down the exterior of the bowl, lid and seat with pre-moistened disinfecting wipes.  Mix a solution of equal parts water and vinegar in a spray bottle. Spray the exterior of the bowl, lid and seat with the solution for a more natural, non-chemical clean. Then wipe all the parts clean with a paper towel or clean rag. Vinegar is a non-toxic product effective in killing most mold, bacteria and germs. This is a safer option for households with dogs who may drink from the bowl or potty-training children who touch the toilet frequently. Maintaining a Clean Bowl Use a solution of 1 part water and 1 part vinegar. Spray the interior and exterior of the bowl daily. Wipe the exterior down, but allow the solution to continue working in the interior bowl until the next flush. Keep pre-moistened disinfecting wipes on hand and use them to wipe the exterior of the bowl daily. This will help keep your toilet clean between regular cleanings. Try products that clip to the side of the bowl that clean the water with each flush.  Employ the use of tablet products that rest in the toilet tank and clean the water with each flush.  Keep the toilet brush clean too. A cleaning tool remains useful only when kept in good and safe condition.
