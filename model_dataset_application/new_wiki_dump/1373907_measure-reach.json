Hold your arm parallel to the floor as it crosses over your body and then repeat the exercise with your other arm. This provides a good stretch for both your arms and shoulders, which helps you to maximize your reach. Stretching your arms and shoulders is the best way to release any tension in your shoulder joints and to prepare for the measurement."
