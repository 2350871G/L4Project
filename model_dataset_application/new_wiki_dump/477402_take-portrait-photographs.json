Avoid direct, harsh sunlight from any direction. Apart from a few hours of soft light in the early morning and afternoon, direct sunlight is largely unfavourable for taking portrait photos. Looking into the sunlight will cause your subject to squint, and harsh light from behind will make it more difficult to get a consistent exposure. From any other angle, it will cast harsh shadows on the face (including the horrid \"raccoon eye\" effect from direct overhead light). Overcast days are best, as clouds will diffuse the sunlight; although since making your own cloud isn't typically an option, head for the shade. Fill the shadows. Sometimes you'll have no choice but to take photos in direct, harsh sunlight. If your camera has a flash sync speed fast enough, use your flash to fill the shadows. If not, get your subject or an assistant to hold a piece of white or colored card to bounce the sunlight into the shadows. You could use your self-timer and hold it yourself. Don't rely on your flash. That is to say, if you don't have a ton of studio lighting (and you probably don't, since you're reading this), don't count on your flash to illuminate your scene or your subject. Using it to fill in shadows is fine; depending on it as your only source of lighting is usually a bad thing. Go outside if weather permits, or get more natural light into your scene by getting closer to windows if it does not."

Factor your subject's feelings in with your lens choices. This is not as strange as it might sound.

On the other hand, a subject might feel distinctly awkward at a monster Howitzer-sized telephoto pointing at them from 50 feet (15.2 m) away. Give your subject something to play with. People with something in their hands will relax their shoulders more and feel less awkward than they would if they were standing around doing nothing. If you're taking body shots, have them hold something relevant to them as a person (for example, an executive might hold a book, a child might hold a teddy bear, a photographer might hold a camera, and so on). If you're not taking body shots, even better; find something to keep their hands occupied. Try a stress ball or something else that gives your subject something to do."

If you're starting out taking portraits, this is probably the best place to start. For this, use a telephoto lens. Ignore the myth of a \"portrait lens\". There is no optimal lens focal length for portraits. Longer lenses are good, because they force you to stand further back, and consequently, due to perspective, facial features like noses are de-emphasised (but see \"factor in your subject's feelings with your lens choices\" above). They also give the illusion of a shallower depth of field (i.e. blurring the background more).In accordance with the rule of thirds, have the subject's eyes one third of the way from the top of the frame. Set your camera to aperture-priority (Av) mode and use a large aperture to blur the background to make it less distracting (or if you have a \"Portrait\" mode on your camera, use that instead). The body shot. All of the above applies. Have your subject stand at a slight angle to the camera; they will look slimmer and more relaxed. The \"environmental\" portrait, of people in action and in context. Compared to the above, this is difficult to get right and very easy to make into a mere snapshot, so tread carefully.
