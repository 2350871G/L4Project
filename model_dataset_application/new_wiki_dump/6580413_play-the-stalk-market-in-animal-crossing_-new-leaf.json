The turnips that you purchase will rot at exactly 6AM the next Sunday, so be sure to sell them before then. If they do end up rotting, you will have to pay Reese to dispose of them.

The price of turnips changes twice a day\u2014when Re-tail opens at 9AM and again at noon. Throughout the week, the price of the turnips will change drastically. They adhere to one of four different fluctuation patterns. You can normally discern the pattern by the fourth day of the week and make the decision on which day to sell your turnips."

          "description":"The declining trend is the most useless of the 4 trends, and the most difficult to profit off of, and recognizing the signs of a declining trend early can save you major bells in the long run. A declining trend's Monday morning price will always be less than 100 bells per turnip. The price will continue to decline a few bells each day, throughout the entire week. If the bell per turnip price is around 90 by the second day, sell all of your turnips ASAP. The random trend is characterized by arbitrary increases and decreases in turnip prices. Despite its name, it follows a fairly steady pattern of increasing and decreasing. If the turnip price on Monday morning is over 100 bells or higher than the buying price, it means the trend for the week is random. Try and keep track of the increases and decreases. It is best to sell the turnips fairly early in the week, during one of the increases. Sometimes, as the week progresses, the price can drop severely."

Pay careful attention to turnip prices for the first two days. If the price is gradually increasing, be sure to check for the spike on the third day. For example, the price may go from 120 bells to 130 bells and then 450 bells. Make sure to sell all your turnips during the third-day spike, because by the fourth day, the prices will go down again."

Unlike the high spike trend, which drastically increases on the third day, this trend is much more gradual. It would look something like: 115 bells, 140 bells, 160 bells, 260 bells, and then a drop in price. If you do not see the 300+ bell spike on the third day, you can correctly identify the trend as low spike instead of high spike, and sell all your turnips on the fourth day."

Although there is no guarantee that the trends will follow this pattern, certain trends are more likely to happen after each other. A declining trend is likely to be followed by a high spike trend, while there are average chances of a random and low spike trend occurring, and a low chance of another declining trend occurring. A random trend is likely to be followed by a high spike and low spike trend, while it is unlikely to be followed by a declining or random trend.
