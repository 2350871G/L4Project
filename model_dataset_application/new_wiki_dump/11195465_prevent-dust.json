Check your filter monthly to see how much dust accumulates. Most filters need to be changed once a year. Use pleated filters in your furnace or air conditioning unit. Fiberglass filters do little to prevent dust, so pleated filters are the way to go. If you\u2019re not sure which filters would work well with your furnace, consult a furnace technician."
