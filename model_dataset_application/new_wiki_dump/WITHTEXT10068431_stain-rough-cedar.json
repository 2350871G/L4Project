As long as you cover the ground, you're set."

It would be a good idea to wait 24 to 48 hours just to be safe, however. Just because the wood is dry on the outside does not mean that it is dry on the inside. Be patient and wait; if you try to stain damp wood, it may rot. It can be hard to tell if the wood is completely dry all the way through. If the piece feels softer or heavier than it did at first, then it's still damp."

An alkyd primer will only help the stain last longer. It is not absolutely necessary. Omit the primer if you're applying a semi-transparent or transparent stain. You will simply have to reapply the stain more often. Make sure that you use an alkyd primer, as other primers may not work on cedar due to the tannins."
