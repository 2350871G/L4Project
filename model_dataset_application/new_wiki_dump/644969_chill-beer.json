However, water will also warm at a faster speed, so make sure you add more ice as it melts. This will require you to dump some of the water out each time you add ice. Since you'll need to dump water periodically, it's best to cool your beer in a cooler that has a drain at the bottom or in a sink that can easily be drained."

Simply turn the compressed air can upside down and spray the beer until frost forms. Holding the compressed air can upside down will help ensure that it\u2019s at its coolest. For safety, try putting your can or bottle into a Tupperware container and making a hole to spray the compressed air through.
