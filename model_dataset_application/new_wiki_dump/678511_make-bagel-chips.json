Don\u2019t let the oil get too hot, as you just want to heat the garlic and oil, not cook them. Alternatively, you can also puree the garlic with the oil in a blender or food processor. In this case, you can even add spices like rosemary to the mix to give the oil an even more powerful flavor. For additional flavor, you can also add minced onion or chives to the oil. If you plan to deep fry your chips as the method of cooking, skip this step."

          "description":"To make small, round bagel chips, slice your bagels into disks that are between one-eighth and one-quarter inch (3.1mm to 6.4 mm) thick. You can use any type of bagel you like to make your bagel chips, including: plain, sesame or poppy seed, everything, cheese or pretzel, or even dessert bagels, such as chocolate chip, blueberry or cinnamon raisin. Bagel chips are most often cut by slicing small disks out of the loop of the bagel, but you can also make large chips by cutting lengthwise disks instead. If you are going to use dessert bagels for your chips, consider omitting the garlic and savory flavors from the oil."

Use a pastry brush or the back of a spoon to coat both sides of each disk with a thin layer of oil. This step is unnecessary if you plan to deep fry or pan fry your bagel chips. Instead, skip this step, and go directly to frying. Season the chips once they are fried. To pan fry your bagel chips, fry them in your seasoned garlic oil instead of spreading the oil over the chips, and season them after they are cooked."

Flip the chips every 15 minutes while they are baking. While this method takes a little more time and effort, the advantage of the slow, low bake is that it gives the flavors of the oil and spices more time to infuse into the bagel chips."

If necessary, flip the chips after the first minute. When they are golden brown, remove the chips from the oil and place them in a bowl lined with a clean towel or paper towel to remove some of the excess oil. Remove the towel and season the chips to taste, shaking them around gently in the bowl to evenly distribute the spices."
