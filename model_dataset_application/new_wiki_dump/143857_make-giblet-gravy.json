Place them in a medium-sized pot and pour in enough water so that it covers the giblets completely by about 2 inches (5.08 cm). Then turn the heat up to medium and let them cook. Many butchers remove the neck and other giblet parts and put them in a sealed bag which they place in the body cavity of the bird. While you are making the giblet gravy, you should also Cook a Turkey. You will use the drippings collected from the turkey to add to the gravy, so be sure to roast the turkey in a pan that collects the drippings in the bottom. Try to time the cooking of your turkey so that it is done roasting either right before you make the gravy or after you finish cooking the giblets."

While you are making the giblet broth, you should also be roasting the rest of the bird. When the turkey is done roasting, take it out of the oven and move the cooked turkey off of the roasting pan. Pour the drippings into a bowl. Take the roasting pan that the turkey was cooking on and pour the drippings into a medium-sized bowl. Use oven mitts because the pan will be extremely hot!

Once the pan has heated, pour some of the fat that you separated out from the drippings into the pan. Add as much or as little as you want, depending on how rich you want the gravy, but make sure to add at least two tablespoons (29.5 ml). Sprinkle in flour and whisk. Once the fat has heated, about two minutes, add in \u00bd cup (118.2 ml) of flour. Use a whisk to mix the fat and the flour to make a paste. If the paste looks too thin or greasy, add in a few more pinches of flour until the consistency is thick. Keep cooking the mixture, whisking constantly, until it browns, about ten minutes.
