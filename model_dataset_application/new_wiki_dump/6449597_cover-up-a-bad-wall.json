Put masking tape, adhesive poster strips, or thumbtacks in all 4 corners to secure your poster to the wall. Look at gift shops, bookstores, or art fairs for a quirky poster or print. Or, order one featuring your favorite band, movie, or famous artwork online. Before you pick out a poster, measure the dimensions of the damaged part of your wall and make sure you pick out something that will cover it up completely.

If you have a large space to cover, look online for a large printed tapestry. Depending on your design preferences, you can find one featuring a scenic vista or a geometric pattern. For even more texture, choose a hand-woven tapestry featuring nubbly yarns and fringe. Browse online for handmade weavings, commission a custom piece, or pick something up at a home d\u00e9cor shop.Try a macrame piece instead of a woven tapestry if you prefer a boho vibe. A tapestry can be the perfect covering for a wall with lumpy, bumpy flaws where flat picture frames might not hang correctly. Soft textiles will drape beautifully over these issues and you\u2019ll forget there was ever a problem."

Cluster mismatched frames in a variety of sizes for a quirky, cozy look. For something more polished, arrange a set of matching frames in a geometric layout. Make your gallery wall as small or large as you need it to be. To test out different configurations, try laying out the pieces on the floor before you mount them. Feel free to use just 1 type of image or a combination of personal photos, artworks, and trinkets. This is a great solution if the part you want to cover up is at an odd height or spot on the wall, such as near a corner, where a standalone frame would look strange."
