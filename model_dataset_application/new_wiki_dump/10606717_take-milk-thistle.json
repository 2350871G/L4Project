Your doctor can also discuss any possible side effects and drug interactions with you. The scientific evidence behind many of the medicinal uses of milk thistle is still inconclusive. Further studies, especially in human rather than animal populations, are needed. However, it is generally safe to use milk thistle when taken in appropriate doses, and it could be beneficial."

          "description":"Research shows that milk thistle might lower blood pressure in people with type 2 diabetes. In combination with other supplements, it might improve the symptoms of indigestion. Silymarin, a flavonoid in the plant with antioxidant properties, could also help treat liver diseases and prevent liver damage. Research also suggests that milk thistle could potentially protect brain functioning, stimulate bone mineralization, improve the effects of some cancer treatments, boost milk production in lactating women, and decrease acne lesions. Silibinin, which is derived from milk thistle, seems to help treat Amanita (death cap) mushroom poisoning by preventing the amatoxins from reaching your liver and damaging it. If you suspect mushroom poisoning, go immediately to your nearest hospital."

If you're allergic to other plants in the asteraceae family, such as ragweed, daisies, marigolds, and chrysanthemums, you're more likely to be allergic to milk thistle. There isn't data on whether or not milk thistle is safe for pregnant women to take, so the safest course is to avoid it during pregnancy. Milk thistle might have estrogenic effects. If you have an estrogen-sensitive condition, including breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids, you should probably avoid taking milk thistle."

Milk thistle might also reduce the effectiveness of the antibiotic metronidazole (Flagyl). Avoid taking them together. Milk thistle taken with the Hepatitis C medication simeprevir (Olysio) could increase the concentrations of the drug in your blood plasma. Avoid taking the two together. Taking milk thistle with the immunosuppressant sirolimus (Rapamune) could change the way that your body processes the medication."

A capsule should contain at least 70% of silymarin, the main active ingredient in milk thistle.

In studies where participants took high doses over long periods, only about 1% of people experienced any. Check with your doctor before discontinuing any medicine. Report any side effects you're experiencing. In some cases, milk thistle can cause an allergic reaction, including anaphylactic shock.
