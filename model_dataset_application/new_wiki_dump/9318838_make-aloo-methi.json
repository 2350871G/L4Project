  "text":" Preparing the Fenugreek Leaves Remove the fenugreek leaves from the stems. Use your fingers to carefully pull the leaves from the stems. Gather the leaves, but discard the stems. Fenugreek leaves are also known as methi leaves. You can find them at Indian grocery stores and some online retailers. Place the stems in a bowl with water and sprinkle salt over them. After you've removed the fenugreek leaves from the steam, add them to a large bowl. Pour enough water into the bowl to cover the leaves, and sprinkle 1 teaspoon (6 g) of salt over them. Allow them to sit for about 10 minutes. Once you've covered the leaves with the water and salt, let them soak for several minutes. This will help remove any residue from the leaves, such as mud or pesticides. Soaking the leaves can also help tone down some of their bitterness. Squeeze the water from the leaves and chop them. Dump the contents of the bowl through a colander in the sink to drain all of the water. Gently grab handfuls of the leaves and press them to remove any excess moisture. Next, use a sharp knife to finely chop the leaves. You can also use a food processor to chop the leaves. Just be careful not to chop them too finely -- you don't want to grind them down to a paste. Cooking the Aromatics Heat the oil. Add 2 tablespoons (30 g) of vegetable oil to a large pan, and place it on the stove. Let the oil heat on medium for 1 to 2 minutes or until it begins to shimmer. You can substitute butter for the vegetable oil if you prefer. Add the cumin and cook it until it pops. When the oil is hot, mix \u00bd teaspoon (1 g) of cumin seeds into the pan. Let the seeds heat until you hear them sizzle or crackle, which should take 30 seconds to 1 minute. Mix in the dried red chile and saute the mixture for a minute. Add 1 dried red chile to the pan with the cumin seeds. Allow the chile to cook briefly to help soften it and release its oils. You can find dried red chilies at Indian grocery stores, spice markets, and many online retailers. Stir in the onions and salt and cook until the onions are tender. Add 1 cup (150 g) of finely chopped onion to the pan, and sprinkle some salt over them. Allow the onions to cook until they become soft and translucent, which should take approximately 2 to 3 minutes. Add the ginger and garlic and cook for a minute. Once the onions are tender, mix 1 teaspoon (2 g) of grated ginger and 1 teaspoon (3 g) of chopped garlic to the pan. Stir well to incorporate the ingredients, and allow the mixture to saute for 1 minute. Finishing the Dish Mix in the potatoes, turmeric, red chili powder, and salt. Add 2 cups (450 g) of chopped or cubed potatoes that have been peeled, \u00bd teaspoon (1 g) of turmeric powder, 1 \u00bd teaspoon (4 g) of red chili powder, and salt to taste. Stir well to blend the seasonings in with the other ingredients. Cover the pan and cook the potatoes until mostly done. Place the lid on the pan, and allow the mixture to cook on medium until the potatoes are almost fork tender. You want them approximately 80% done, which should take about 5 to 10 minutes. Stir the potatoes as they're cooking to ensure that they don't stick to the bottom of the pan. Add the fenugreek leaves. Once the potatoes are nearly done, mix the fenugreek leaves into the pan. Stir well to ensure that they're evenly distributed throughout the mixture. Continue cooking the mixture until the potatoes are finished. Place the lid on the pan again, and allow the mixture to cook until the potatoes are completely fork tender. It should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes. Stir the mixture occasionally to keep the potatoes from burning or sticking to the pan. Stir in the lemon juice and remove from the pan from stove. Add 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of fresh lemon juice to the pan, and mix it in well. Turn off the stove, and take the pan off the burner. Serve the dish while warm. Transfer the aloo methi to a serving dish. Divide it between bowls, and serve it while it's still hot. Aloo methi is often served with rice or roti.",
