  "text":" Banana Santa Prepare the strawberry hats. Choose large strawberries to make Santa hats. Cut them into halves. You'll need two strawberry hats per one banana. Peel a banana. Discard the peel and place the banana on a cutting board. Cut the banana in half. Cut in the middle of the banana to form two halves. Stick each banana half onto a skewer at the cut ends. Have the uncut ends sticking upward from the skewer. Decorate the banana halves to transform them into Santa. Spray or dollop whipped cream on the tops of the banana pieces. This forms Santa's hair. Attach the strawberry halves on the whipped cream ends of the bananas. This makes Santa's hat. You may need to hollow a little of the fruit out from the strawberry but only do this if the \"hats\" aren't sitting well. Usually they will sit fine atop the cream. Place a dab of whipped cream on top of the strawberry. Add a small marshmallow to complete the hat. Add eyes for each banana Santa. Using whipped cream as \"glue\", add small dabs where the eyes are to go. Add the eyes\u2013\u2013these can be small marshmallows, small candies such as M&Ms, or something healthier such as eyes cut from strawberries or other berries. The nose can be an M&M and the mouth a jelly bean. Add a beard. Spray or dollop on a whipped cream beard. Once this is done, banana Santa is finished. Serve laying down on plates. Broccoli Christmas Tree Use broccoli to make a savory Christmas platter for dips or just munching raw. This tree is simple to make and looks great on the buffet table. Prepare the vegetables. You will need the vegetables to be prepared as follows:\nCut or pull the broccoli and cauliflower into florets. Trim neatly if required. Cut the yellow bell pepper into thin, neat slices. Arrange the vegetables to form a tree on a large serving platter. A long platter is best for this project. The tree is made from just the broccoli florets and the cherry (grape) tomatoes. Follow a large triangle formation to shape the \"tree\":\nStart at the base of the tree, being sure to leave sufficient room below for the tree trunk and snow base. Place a row of broccoli florets across the tree base. Make the next row one of cherry (grape) tomatoes. You'll find that the broccoli florets on the rows below and above will fit in around the tomatoes. Continue making rows of broccoli florets in a triangle formation, adding a few less to each row to decrease the row lengths until the tree top is reached. Add one more row of the tomatoes nearer to the top, or wherever you feel it looks best. Add the star. The star is formed at the top of the tree by criss-crossing the yellow bell pepper slices. Make the trunk. Use the pretzel sticks lined up alongside each other to form a thick trunk at the base of the tree. Judge the width of the trunk against the size and shape of your broccoli tree; keep it properly proportioned. Add the snow. Place the cauliflower florets across the base of the arrangement, including around the tree's trunk. This is the \"snow\" under the tree. Add a dip. The broccoli tree is now ready for serving as a holiday treat and guests can simply take pieces of the tree to dip and enjoy. Grape Christmas Tree Make a sweet version of the Christmas tree that is still healthy. You'll need a Christmas tree-shaped platter for this project. These can be found in dollar or kitchenware stores and often from Christmas displays in general stores. Arrange a row of grapes for the base part of the tree.  Arrange a row of strawberries as the next row. If they are too large to sit neatly, cut them into halves and arrange the halves. Add two rows of grapes. Follow with a row of blueberries. Continue to add rows. Favor wider rows of grapes, to form the bulk \"green\" of the tree and keep the blueberry and strawberry rows smaller as the \"garlands\" of the tree. Keep making rows until everything has been added and the platter is full. Serve with a sweet dip or sauce of your choice.  3-D Christmas Tree Make a fruity Christmas tree that stands up from the platter. This can be made with other fruits or with vegetables as well, so once you've mastered this one, try experimenting with other pieces of your favorite fruit or veggies to see how they might work. Place the apple half on the platter. The cut side should be facing downward. This forms the base of the tree and stabilizes it. Place the skewer into the middle of the apple half. Check that it is sitting in the apple firmly. This forms the backbone of the 3-D tree. Add the kiwifruit slices one by one. Start with the largest slices first and keep adding the smaller slices until the smallest are at the top. Pierce the slices close to one end of each slice, allowing most of the slice to hang away from the skewer. Arrange the slices as you add them. The effect of the tree is only made if the slices are not sitting on top of each other but are arranged like a fan around the tree. Fan them out so that no single slice is sitting on top of the one below it but is fanned out away from the lower slice. In this way, you will get a visual effect of a tree as the slices spiral outwards. Continue until all of the kiwifruit slices have been added to the tree. Cut a slice of the starfruit. Slide this star-shaped slice on the top of the tree for its star. If there is any excess skewer left over, you could either snip it off or add more fruit and add the star after. Sprinkle the base of the platter with the pomegranate seeds. This completes the look and makes it visually appealing. You could add berries as well, such as raspberries and blueberries.",
