If you own a big house, hosting the party at home is fine as long as you restrict certain parts of the house and clear out some space for the party. If your house isn't big enough to host a party, see if you could rent a dance floor, a winery, a room at an events center, or something similar for the party."

Try to ask around a bit to see what dates are good for some of your guests so that they will be able to attend. Consider other things like holidays and school schedules that might prevent some of your guests from coming. Try to choose a weekend date so that people don\u2019t have to worry about leaving the party early because they have to work the next day."
