The float rises with the water and tells the inlet valve on the ballcock (the float) when to shut off the water valve. If the water keeps flowing past the overflow tube, there is likely a leak. To check the inlet valve, flush the toilet and lift the rod that holds the float as the water rises. If you hear the water stop, the problem is caused by the float, and it likely needs to be replaced. A new float and rod are very easy to replace and will only cost a few dollars at the hardware store."

The flapper is a round rubber seal that sits at the bottom of the tank. Its purpose is to stop the water inside the tank from entering the toilet bowl.Turn off the water supply valve near the toilet, and check if the water level in the tank decreases. If there is a decrease after 15-20 minutes, the problem could be due to the flapper. There could either be a leak in the flapper, or the chain may be too tight."
