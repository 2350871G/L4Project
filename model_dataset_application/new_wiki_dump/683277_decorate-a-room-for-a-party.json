Take the occasion into consideration as you start to think about decorations. You should also consider who the party is for. For example, if you\u2019re celebrating a child\u2019s birthday, you\u2019ll probably want to make a bigger statement with the decorations than if you\u2019re decorating for an adult\u2019s birthday."

For example, if you\u2019re having the event at a private dining room in a restaurant, you may not be able to decorate as extensively as you would for a party at home. You should also take the size of the room and the height of the ceiling into account because the dimensions may limit the decorations that you can use.

However, if you\u2019re celebrating a birthday, anniversary, graduation, or other milestone, it often helps to choose a specific theme to help you organize the decorations. Try to come up with a theme that reflects the interests of the guest(s) of honor. For example, if you\u2019re throwing a birthday party for a friend who likes to go sailing, you might settle on a nautical theme. For an anniversary party for a couple who likes to gamble, you might choose a Las Vegas or Monte Carlo theme. Movies, cartoon characters, and TV shows make fun party themes that are easy to customize for the guest(s) of honor. A tropical or luau theme can be a festive general party theme. Pick an interesting, distinctive time period, such as the roaring \u201820s or the \u201860s, as your party theme. You can even have guests dress up according to the trends of the era. If you love to travel, consider giving your party an around the world theme. If you\u2019re throwing a party for a big sports fan, use their favorite team as inspiration for the event\u2019s theme."

If you\u2019re celebrating a specific milestone, such as a birthday, anniversary, or graduation, you may want to hang a banner for the event on the wall. Photos, posters, artwork, festive garlands, and other signs that you can find the party supply store are ideal options. For an party that honors specific people, you may want to hang photos of them on the wall. For example, if you\u2019re celebrating your parents\u2019 anniversary, decorate with copies of their wedding photos or other meaningful moments in their lives. If you\u2019re celebrating a friend\u2019s birthday, you may want to use baby photos to decorate. If your party has a specific theme, you can use photos or artwork that fit the look, such as photos of your favorite movie stars for a Hollywood theme, on the walls. You don\u2019t have to ruin your walls to hang photos or other artwork on the walls. Use removable mounting tape on the backs, or run a piece of string or ribbon across the walls and use clothespins or binder clips to attach the photos to the string. If you have scraps of ribbon at home, make a fun garland to decorate the walls or any columns or railings in the room. Loop the small scraps around the longest piece of ribbon and tie them off in bows for a festive look."

Hang the streamers across the ceiling so they all meet at the center, where you can arrange a cluster of balloons to hide the tape. You can also place balloons at the ceiling\u2019s corners for added color. When you\u2019re hanging streamers across the ceiling, you can keep the crepe paper straight or twist it as you go to give them a spiraled effect. While you can arrange balloons in haphazard bunches, it\u2019s also fun to create flowers out of them. Gather five or six balloons in the same color to serve as the petals, and place them around a yellow balloon that be the flower\u2019s center. Tie all of the balloons together, and use tape to attach the \u201cflower\u201d to the ceiling. You don\u2019t just have to hang the streamers across the ceiling. Instead, try having them hang straight down from the ceiling to create a curtain that guests can have fun passing through. In addition to simple latex balloons, you may want to add a few foil balloons. They come in a wide variety of shapes and themes, so you can probably find some that fit your party\u2019s look to a tee."

Simple string lights usually used at Christmas come in variety of colors, including multicolored, and you can hang them across the walls, windows, and ceiling, or wind them around railings and columns. You can also hang colorful paper lanterns from the party supply store to help dress up the room. If you want a more elegant look for your party, opt for white string lights instead of colored strands. String lights are also available in fun shapes, such as hearts, stars, seashells, and chili peppers, so you may be able to find a variety that fits your party\u2019s theme. You can also use candles to give the room a more sophisticated feel. Just make sure to place them in locations where they won\u2019t be knocked over and keep them away from flammable materials."

For example, if you\u2019re throwing an Oscar or a Hollywood themed party, you want to create a red carpet for the room by laying down a piece of red fabric for guests to walk across. For a dance themed party, you may want to hang a mirrored disco ball in the center of the room. For a child\u2019s birthday, a pinata that fits the theme makes an ideal decoration. At your local party supply store, you can find inflatable decorations in a variety of fun shapes that fit an array of themes. For example, you might place an inflatable palm tree in the corner of the room for a tropical party, or an inflatable treasure chest in the corner for a pirate themed party."

They also protect your table or other surfaces in case there are any spills during the party. Choose a bold or bright color that matches the other decorations at the party. Consider laying tablecloths in two or more different colors for a festive look. Make sure to choose one that\u2019s slightly larger than the others so the bottom will peek one from underneath the top layer. For a casual party, disposable plastic tablecloths are the best option. They are inexpensive and come in a wide range of colors, so you can some that match the rest of your decorations. For an elegant, sophisticated party, you may prefer fabric tablecloths. They can be somewhat expensive, though, so if you\u2019re only going to use a certain color for the party, you may prefer borrowing one from friends or family members."

A floral arrangement is a traditional option -- you can purchase fresh flowers or use artificial or dried flowers to create a centerpiece for the table. If you\u2019re not a fan of flowers, you can substitute balloon or create a custom centerpiece that fits your party\u2019s theme. For example, if you\u2019re throwing a zoo theme party, you might use stuffed animals to make a centerpiece for the table. For a Christmas party, a large bowl filled with fruit, pine cones, ornaments, and garland can make a simple but beautiful centerpiece. For a Halloween party, a jack o'lantern is the ideal centerpiece. For a child\u2019s birthday party, you can put vases or jars filled with colorful candy, such as gumballs, rock candy, gumdrops, and lollipops, in an arrangement to create a centerpiece for the table. Create a simple centerpiece for an elegant party by filling a large bowl with water and adding floating candles."
