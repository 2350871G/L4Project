          "description":"Unknown leaks in your household can waste up to 3,000 gallons (11,000 L) of water a year. For this reason, be sure to check your plumbing for leaks, especially leaking toilets and faucets. If you find a leak, figure out the source of the leak and try to fix it. If it's serious, you may have to enlist the help of a plumber, and find out whether your homeowner's insurance or renter's insurance will cover any damage it has caused. If you're unsure about whether your toilet is leaking or not, put some food coloring in the tank and let it sit for 10-15 minutes without flushing. If you see food coloring in the toilet after the time has passed, you have a leak."

Install a water-saving shower head that will maintain the pressure and feel of the flow while using as little as half as much water as conventional units. Depending on the quality, these shower heads typically range in cost from $10-$30. You can also install a valve behind the shower head that will allow you to turn off the water while you soap up and then turn the water back on while preserving the temperature."

Cutting down your shower time by just two minutes can save 10 gallons (37.9 L) of water. Taking a shower uses roughly one third of the amount of water used in taking a bath, depending on the size of your tub and depth of the water. So skip the bath and take a short shower instead."

A dual-flush toilet allows you to use less water to flush liquid waste and more water to flush solid waste simply by pressing the correct button. You can buy a dual-flush conversion kit to turn your water-guzzling toilet into a water-saver. Search the web for devices like SelectAFlush and TwoFlush. They both work well and save money. Not all toilets will be able to flush effectively with a reduced amount of water, so be sure to check that your toilet does.

Depending on the laws where you live, it\u2019s possible to re-route grey water and use it to flush your toilets or water your lawn so as not to be wasteful. If watering plants, don\u2019t use grey water on anything you might eat, as the water could be contaminated. The easiest way to use grey water is to link it directly from the indoors to the outdoors using piping, and then use the water on your garden or yard. Reducing Your Water Footprint Eat and buy locally. If your food, clothing, or other goods had to travel a long distance to get to you, it probably used a lot of water in doing so. The production of gasoline uses many gallons of water, so try to purchase local foods and merchandise to reduce your water footprint. Shop for your food at a local farmers market, or find local boutiques where you can purchase clothing. Instead of heading to huge chain stores such as Walmart or Target, try to buy your goods from individual local businesses that specialize in what you need. Eat less meat and dairy. Growing animal feed uses tons of water, not to mention the amount of water used in the rest of the meat and dairy production process. Learn to fish and hunt responsibly for more sustainable animal protein. The more domesticated meat and dairy you eat, the more animals are needed to keep up with the demand, so try to limit your intake of such foods. Cut down on the amount of processed foods you eat. Every step needed to process food uses lots of water. By eating fresher food, not only will you cut down on your water footprint, but you'll also feel healthier! Sugar cane uses much more water to grow than most other crops - cut out those sugary foods to help save water and stay healthier. Drink water. All of those other beverages \u2014wine, tea, soda, juice \u2014 took water to produce too. More water is used to help power the factory where the soda is made and grow the fruits and sugar used in juice than is worth the large water footprint it causes. Instead of drinking a soft drink, opt for plain water - the health advantages are in your favor as well as the Earth's. Carpool, bike, or use public transportation. By carpooling to school, biking to work, or taking a bus to run errands, you'll cut down on energy use as well as water use. As stated earlier, it takes many gallons of water to produce one gallon of gasoline, so do your part and try to drive less. Reuse or recycle products. It takes hundreds of gallons of water to produce everything from a t-shirt to a ream of paper. Donate old clothes, furniture, or any other household items to charities or donation centers, and recycle your paper, plastics, and metals. Reduce, reuse, recycle is usually the best policy when it comes to the environment, and trying to save water is no exception.",
