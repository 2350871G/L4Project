The recipe is fairly simple, but you may need to go to a specialty food store for ingredients if your local supermarket doesn\u2019t carry them. For kheer that serves four people you\u2019ll need the following ingredients: 1 cup of slightly overcooked rice, 2 cups of whole milk, 3 tablespoons sugar, 1 tablespoon raisins, 1 tablespoon chopped pistachios, 1 tablespoon chopped almonds, 1/8 teaspoon powdered cardamom, and a pinch of saffron. You can use any type of rice, such as long grained or basmati, for this recipe. It\u2019s probably best to not use flavored rice like jasmine or coconut. If you have leftover rice from another dish, you can use it to make kheer. If you are making the rice just for kheer, it\u2019s best to overcook it a little bit to mimic the texture of leftover rice."

It\u2019s important to do this before you begin cooking so that your kheer doesn\u2019t burn while you mix the ingredients. Put the raisins in a little bit of water to puff them up. Use any small or medium heavy bottomed pan that you have to cook the kheer. Heat the pan over a medium gas flame or electric stove setting. While the pan is heating up, grind the saffron and a pinch of sugar with a mortar and pestle. Set it to the side."
