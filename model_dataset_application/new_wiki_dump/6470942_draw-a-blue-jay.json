The head is curved, and at the top, try to draw a tuft of small, messy feathers. It should look like a big triangle, just like the beak. Draw the bird's curved body. The Blue Jay is known to be buff because it has a lot of feathers. Starting down from the beak, the body is shaped like an oval.

Add lines going across the tail and lines going down/up. The end of the tail should have a slight tuft where small feathers should be popping. Draw a little semi-circle connecting the body and the tail. On the oval, sketch two triangles going down.
