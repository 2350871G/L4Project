To break it open and get to him, Sora needs to use the Reaction Command (\u2206) \"Learn\" whenever Xaldin does any melee attacks. Now that his Attack command has been replaced with Jump, Sora will now dispel the Aero Shield and is free to attack Xaldin for a little bit. You can also summon Stitch as his attack will stun Xaldin when he\u2019s hit at the right moment.
