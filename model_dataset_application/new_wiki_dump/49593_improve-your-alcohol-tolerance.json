A person can increase their alcohol tolerance without becoming dependent, though having too high an alcohol tolerance likely means you are also dependent. Tolerance means that your body adapts to the consumption of a specific amount of alcohol, even in amounts such as one beer or one glass of wine. Dependence means that you consistently and compulsively consume alcohol and need it to function, a dangerous state you want to avoid. If your alcohol tolerance becomes too high, it's likely a sign that you're dependent, which can be dangerous not only for you, but also the people around you."

In general, the smaller the typical serving size, the stronger the drink. A shot of whiskey can have as much alcohol as an entire light beer. In many countries, the alcohol content is labelled on the container. The higher the content, the higher the effect. Sweet fruity drinks and/or cocktails can be very difficult to judge on alcoholic content--especially for a novice. Since these can vary widely based on the bartender, there is no one standard. Not all types of drinks are standardized. A typical lager-style beer is usually about 5% alcohol, but some craft beers are 20% or more. Different drinks may produce different effects. Be aware that while inebriation has common effects, different types of drinks may cause slightly different effects. For example, a person may be much more mellow drinking wine than after having tequila."

Have one drink, then perhaps another in a safe environment with responsible drinkers. Do not put yourself in a situation where impairment is inherently dangerous, or with people who are irresponsible and are likely to push you past your comfort zone. If you do not normally consume alcohol, or have one or two drinks once a week, your tolerance will be comparatively low.

It is important to realize that alcohol consumption is never risk-free and that while you may not feel the effects of alcohol consumption, you may nevertheless be too impaired to function normally. Go slowly. For example, consume only one additional drink than you normally would. If you never drink, start with one, or even a half of, alcoholic beverage. If you usually have one glass of wine or one spirit, have one and a half or two drinks. This will ensure that you do not consume too much alcohol as you increase your tolerance. Consider having one glass of water in between drinks to help yourself consume drinks slowly. Eat while drinking. Consuming food while drinking helps keep the alcohol from having quite as strong an effect. Drinking on an empty stomach will cause much more inebriation than on a full one."

          "description":"Remember, you are increasing your tolerance and avoiding dependence. By consuming alcohol within sensible guidelines, you will run less risk of becoming dependent or harming yourself. Remember that your judgement will be impaired on alcohol--you can be drunk and not think you are. For this reason, it is often good to have a friend to keep tabs on your drinking, and help you to stay within the sensible guidelines for drinking. Alcohol units are based on the percentage alcohol in a beverage and the amount of alcohol consumed. One unit of alcohol is 10ml of pure alcohol. Since most alcohol beverages are not pure alcohol, the percentage of alcohol in the drink is a factor in the number of units. For reference, a bottle of wine has 9-10 units. For example, one pint of beer with a 4% alcohol volume 2.3 units. If you prefer spirits, such as scotch, a \"single\" scotch of 25ml has one unit. Or maybe you prefer wine, in which case, one 175ml glass has 2.3 units. The guidelines for sensible drinking recommend no more than 2-3 units of alcohol a day for women. This would be the equivalent of approximately one beer or glass of wine per day, or two to three single spirits. The guidelines for sensible drinking recommend no more than 3-4 units of alcohol a day for men. This would be the equivalent of approximately 1-2 beers or glasses of wine, or 3-4 spirits per day."

In the long term, alcohol consumption can cause the following health problems: high blood pressure, chronic liver disease, and breast cancer."

The amount of time between food and alcohol consumption also affects your tolerance. For example, if you consume a large meal either just before or during alcohol consumption, your tolerance will be greater. If you have a smaller meal and wait to drink, your tolerance will be correspondingly lower. Remember that food only delays the absorption of alcohol into your system. You won\u2019t necessarily be able to consume much more alcohol than you usually do, so it\u2019s best to err on the side of caution and not go overboard."
