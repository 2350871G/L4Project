Most pastas take about 10-11 minutes to be soft but check on the package directions to be sure, they usually give the exact time there. Once the elbows are fully boiled place a colander in the sink and drain all the pasta. Be careful, it will be hot! Set aside. Shake the colander around to dry the pasta off. You may need to even toss it as well."

To help it melt use a wooden spoon or fork to move the butter around the heat. Once the butter has melted and starts to bubble pour in the flour and stir with a whisk. The mixture will look like a watery, brown liquid which is normal. If your mixture is beginning to thicken you may have added too much flour or very little butter. The mixture should be watery like a liquid."

Pizza stones can withstand high temperatures so you won't have to worry a lot about it like other baking pans. Plus you can easily slice your pizza without scratching the bottom or surface. That's why most restaurants and professional chefs bake their pizzas on pizza stones or baking stones. They may be pricy but they last for a long time and are worth it."
