Let the mixture cool, checking on it every few minutes with a candy thermometer until it reaches 240 degrees F (115.5 degrees C), about eight minutes. 240 degrees F (115.5 C) is known as the \u201csoft ball stage\u201d of candy making. Fudge, pralines and other soft treats are made by cooking their ingredients to this temperature. Candy thermometers are designed to measure the temperature of melted sugar and syrups. They have a much higher temperature range than regular thermometers, which are used primarily for checking the temperature of meat and typically only go up to 200 or 220 degrees F (93.3-104.4 C)."

Making Maple Chocolate Fudge Place a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Place a medium sized saucepan over medium heat on the stove. Try to use a pan with a thick bottom, which will heat the sugar mixture more evenly than a thin saucepan. Add all ingredients except chocolate to the pan.

Don\u2019t stir the mixture after you take it off the heat. Instead, let it sit for 20 minutes. Melt the chocolate in a double broiler. While the maple mixture cools for 20 minutes, place one inch (2.54 cm) of water into the bottom of a double boiler or a medium saucepan. Place it on the stove and turn the heat to medium until the water begins to simmer. Then chop the chocolate and place it into the top of double broiler, or a heat-safe plate, and put it over the bottom of the broiler. Stir the chocolate with a spatula continuously until it has melted. Pour and scrape the melted chocolate into a bowl, then set it aside.

Pour the maple mixture into a pan, then pour over the chocolate. Line a pan with tin foil or parchment paper, then lightly butter. Pour in the newly mixed maple mixture into the pan, scraping the sides of the bowl to get it all out. Then pour the melted chocolate in a layer over the maple mixture. Chill the pan of fudge. Place the pan of fudge into the refrigerator uncovered. Let it chill for at least two hours, and up to one day, until it is firm to the touch. If you eat it before it has firmed, it will not have the right consistency. Cut and serve. When you are ready to eat the fudge, remove it from the refrigerator.
