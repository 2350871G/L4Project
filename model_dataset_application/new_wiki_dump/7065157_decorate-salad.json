You can slice up things like cucumbers, carrots, strawberries, or tomatoes. The exact thickness of the slices depends entirely on personal preference\u2014if you like carrots chopped thinly and strawberries cut in thick slices, that's okay."

          "description":"To create a more elaborate decoration, stack up the slices of your fruit or veggie and stick a toothpick all the way through them. Spread each slice out a bit so that they are slightly overlapping, creating a swirl effect. You can slice up an apple and stick a toothpick through the slices to create a fanned look, or you can use semicircle cucumber slices. Leave the toothpick in the fanned-out food when you put it in the salad, but make sure whoever's eating it is aware that the toothpick is there."

Use a knife to cut horizontal, shallow cuts about 1 cm (0.39 in) long into the strawberry, starting at the bottom and going around the strawberry in tiers until you get to the top. Pull each cut out slightly to make the strawberry look like a flower."

Use cookie cutters in different shapes, such as circles, stars, or hearts, to create unique slices of food. You can also use cookie cutters to cut up a protein for your salad, such as chicken."

Use a peeler to peel around the cucumber\u2019s edges, creating a long string of the vegetable. Once you're satisfied with the length of the string of cucumber, peel the section off completely. Go slowly as you peel so that you don\u2019t accidentally peel off the string until it\u2019s finished. If you don't want the cucumber's skin in your salad, use the peeler to peel the skin off of the cucumber before creating the string."

Do this to two different tomatoes, discarding the ends, and then put the longer sections together so that they create a heart shape. Push a toothpick through the tomatoes to hold the heart together. You can also do this with mandarin orange slices. The flesh of the tomatoes should be pressed against each other when they're in the shape of a heart. When you place the heart shapes in the salad, make sure the person who's eating the salad is aware of the toothpicks."
