When made into juice, though, these vegetables may seem difficult to drink alone, so they are often paired with sweeter vegetables or fruits."

Plenty of fruits offer vitamins and minerals that can benefit your raw juice, however. You can either create your own raw, unpasteurized fruit juice and drink it by itself or you can add it to your vegetable juice for a fruity, sweet twist of flavor. Grape juice can make an especially flavorful addition."

The pulp and juice are separated, but the pulp does tend to be fairly moist, suggesting that not all the juice has been squeezed out. Most fruits and vegetables work well with a centrifugal juicer, but it should not be used for wheatgrass or dandelion greens."

These juicers can take a while, but the juice that is produced is relatively high-quality. Most fruits and vegetables can be juiced using a masticating juicer, and you can also use these juicers to produce baby food, sauce, and nut butter."

Citrus juicers are fairly common. Cut a citrus fruit, like lemon, lime, orange, or grapefruit, in half. Wring the half out over the juicer using the juicer's peak. Wheatgrass juicers are used to literally grind the juice out of wheatgrass or other similar grasses. They work similar to the way that a masticating juicer works, except that you operate it by hand rather than by electricity."
