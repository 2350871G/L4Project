You can take some liberties with how much of a certain drink you would like to make. This is great for drinks where you may want to make a pitcher for a large gathering.For example, if a recipe calls for 1 part vodka and 2 parts tonic water, you can either pour 1 shot of vodka and 2 shots of tonic water, or 2 shots of vodka and 4 shots of tonic water, etc."

A double shot refers to 2 shots, which is 2 fluid ounces (59 mL). Many recipes don\u2019t require their alcohol measurements to be exact."

If you don\u2019t have a jigger, you can measure out 1.5 fluid ounces (44 mL) of alcohol to mix into your drink. Some jiggers hold different amounts of liquid, but a standard one is 1.5 fluid ounces (44 mL).Only classic cocktails, like Old Fashioneds and Cosmopolitans, will use this measurement."

You can add more or less if you choose to do so.If you are uncertain, pour a small amount of your ingredient and taste it. Add more if you think it needs it. Cocktails often call for splashes of citrus juices, simple syrups, and berry juices."

Add 3 to 6 drops of bitters to your drink depending on how you like your drink. Start with less and add more if you would like to.Tip: Dashes are such a small measurement that a slight discrepancy between drinks won\u2019t make that much of a difference."

To give you better control, attach a meal bottle spout on the mouth of a liquor bottle before you pour. These spouts help slow down the flow of liquor.Tip: Count in your head as you free pour alcohol. 1 count is 0.25 fluid ounces (7.4 mL), 2 counts is 0.5 fluid ounces (15 mL), 3 counts is 0.75 fluid ounces (22 mL), and 4 counts is 1 fluid ounce (30 mL)."

If you only have a few ingredients, pour them 1 at a time into a cocktail beaker. Add up the amounts of all the ingredients that you have, and subtract them from the total as you pour them into the beaker.For example, if your recipe calls for 2 fluid ounces (59 mL) of vodka, 1 fluid ounce (30 mL) of triple sec, and 1 fluid ounce (30 mL) of lime juice, add those up to get 4 fluid ounces (120 mL). Use the measurements on the side of the beaker to measure each ingredient until you get to  4 fluid ounces (120 mL)."

Ones that don\u2019t hold much volume are the best because they will have smaller measurements on the side. Pour your ingredients in the measuring cup 1 at a time and add them up as you go. For example, if your recipe calls for 1 fluid ounce (30 mL) of Campari, 2 fluid ounces (59 mL) of orange juice, and 1 fluid ounce (30 mL) of sparkling water, use your measuring cup to pour each ingredient one at a time until you reach 4 fluid ounces (120 mL)."
