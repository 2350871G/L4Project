This is a cake that you will want your guests to photograph for their Instagram accounts, so choose a memorable and quirky design to match you and your partner's personalities. If your cake will be on display throughout your celebration meal, make sure your color choices don't clash. For instance, a fall-themed cake could have autumn colors, a winter wedding could have a white/silver/blue cake, and a tropical destination wedding could have a vibrantly-colored cake."

          "description":"There are many different styles you can pick for your wedding, and they can range greatly in terms of formality and atmosphere. The cake colors you\u2019d have for a rustic mountain wedding would most likely be different than the cake colors you\u2019d choose for an elegant evening wedding. If the dress code for your wedding is black tie and the theme is a more traditional and sophisticated wedding, then choose simple and elegant colors, such as black and white. If you are having a more relaxed, boho wedding, or a nature-inspired wedding, you can choose colors found in nature, such as green or yellow. If your wedding style is bold and adventurous, then go for a purple ombre frosted cake, or consider red velvet cake with white frosting."

          "description":"If an amateur baker has offered to make your wedding cake or if you can't set aside much of your wedding budget on cake, you might want to go with a more simple cake design. Simplicity can be quite elegant, so don't stress about spending all of your wedding money on the cake. Colors of frosting may stain the cake itself, and it might be difficult to slice if you pick a lot of decorations, so take each detail into consideration."

She is certified to plan and run weddings by the Bridal Society Educational Course. Her work has been featured in A Practical Wedding, Junebug Weddings, Ceremony Magazine, and The Bridal Society. Megan Papageorge\t\t\tCertified Wedding Planner\t\t\t\tWhat Our Expert Does: I usually recommend that my clients choose a cake with lighter colors. The dyes they use to create bold-colored icing can dye your lips and teeth, and you don't want that in your reception photos. However, if you want to incorporate your colors, consider choosing fondant over buttercream, because most people won't eat the fondant."

          "description":"Consider which colors your wedding party will be wearing. It can be fun to have the accents of the cake match the dresses of your bridesmaids. You can also have fun with the cake colors by becoming inspired by the location of your wedding. If you are getting married on a beach, for instance, consider getting a cake that incorporates a pastel color, such as baby blue."

          "description":"You may want to select a color palette that is particularly symbolic to you and your beau. Wedding cake can be frosted or iced to imitate works of art, photographs of the couple, a favorite location, flowers, and anything else that your heart desires."

Decide if you would like the flavors of your cake to influence the colors you choose. A rich chocolate cake will be brown in color, but you can still choose any color for the frosting, icing, or decoration. A delicately-flavored vanilla sponge cake might not suit dark purple frosting with bright orange sugar flowers, for instance, but the choice is yours."

If they can't make you a cake in the exact shade you want, you may want to choose another wedding cake maker, or compromise with the closest shade possible. Ask for a cake consultation in advance of your wedding. The baker will inform you about prices, let you sample various flavors, and discuss color options for your cake. Consultations typically run from 20 minutes to an hour and can cost around $50."
