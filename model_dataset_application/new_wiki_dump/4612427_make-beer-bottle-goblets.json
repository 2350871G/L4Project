They can also bunch up around your cutting blade and make it more difficult to cut an even line. Be sure to peel labels off completely before cutting your bottle. Soaking the bottle in warm water can help loosen the label. Consider store bought products like Goo Gone that can dissolve the glue used to attach beer labels to the bottles."

          "description":"You have two options here. You can cut the bottle closer to the top where the glass starts to curve into the spout. With this method, you will eventually glue the neck to the bottom of the bottle. You can also make the cut around the circumference of the bottle about an inch from the bottom. This way you can flip the bottle over and just glue the spout to the bottom piece which will act as the base. The second method will allow liquid to be poured into the neck which allows the goblet to hold more and also adds some character to it."

          "headline":"Secure the bottle.",
          "description":"Making a straight cut is difficult if the bottle is moving around. Most store bought cutters made specifically for cutting bottles will have rollers and guides to keep the bottle in place. Consider asking a friend to hold the bottle at both ends while you focus on cutting. Have your friend slowly spin the bottle as you cut so that you are working together to move around the entire bottle. If you are cutting around the bottom of the bottle you can use a roll of duct tape as a holder. Insert the bottle into the center of the roll and grip it tight. With your free hand, position the glass cutter against the bottle. Keep the glass cutter still, using the roll of tape as a base, and start to turn the bottle until the line you are cutting meets itself on the other end."

You can mark this area with a magic marker or by tying a piece of string around the bottle tightly to act as a guide. You should be using some pressure to make the cut around the glass. It\u2019s normal to hear a scraping noise and the line on the bottle should be visible as you cut. You don\u2019t need to cut all the way through. You are just scoring the bottle at this point. You may need to go around two or three times depending on how thick the bottle is and how deep your first cut went."

          "description":"Scoring the bottle with the glass cutter will not make a deep enough cut to completely separate the bottle into two parts. It will only weaken that part of the bottle. Spin the place you made your cut under warm water from your tap for about a minute and then rub it down with an ice cube. The change in temperature will cause the glass to contract and expand, eventually splitting the bottle cleanly where you made your cut. You may need to repeat this process a few times. If the bottle still isn\u2019t splitting, consider going back over your cut once more with the glass cutter, this time applying more pressure."

Be sure to make the edges as even as possible. Once it seems even, start working the edges at an angle to round them out. Work the outside edge first and then move on to the inside edge. This will make the rim of the glasses smooth so that you won't run the risk of cutting yourself when you are drinking. A small rotary sander can make this part go much faster.
