Hold your hands under a stream of cold tap water while rubbing a stainless steel item between them for 1\u20132 minutes.

          "headline":"Spray your hands with fresh lemon juice if you don\u2019t have steel objects.",
          "description":"Acidic citrus fruits like lemon and lime are great at neutralizing the odorous compounds contained in garlic. If your hands smell like garlic, try squirting out about 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of lemon juice onto 1 hand. Rub the juice over both of your hands (including your fingers). Then wash your hands with cold water and soap. Give your hands a sniff; the smell of garlic should be gone. Fresh lemon works best for removing garlic\u2019s smell. If you happen to have a lemon fruit at your home, cut it in half and squeeze the lemon juice right onto your palm."

Put your hands together and rub the coffee grounds over the fronts and backs of your hands and between your fingers. The coffee grounds will get rid of the garlic smell and replace it with the pleasant smell of coffee. Rinse your hands under the tap to get the grounds off. As an added perk, the coarse coffee grounds will exfoliate your skin when you rub them over your hands."

Pick up a bottle of perfume (or cologne, if you prefer) and spray 1 or 2 blasts directly onto your hands or wrists. This should mask the garlicky smell for 4\u20135 hours. Once that amount of time has passed, you can either reapply perfume or use another method to deodorize your hands."

Try drinking about 1 cup (240 mL) to start and see if that takes care of the smell. Drinking lime juice should have the same effect."

Many people find milk more palatable than lemon juice, so try this option if you dislike sour foods. Studies have indicated that milk reduces the presence of garlic on people\u2019s breath. If you don\u2019t want to have to worry about garlic breath at all, just have a glass of milk with your garlicky meal."

          "headline":"Eat a fresh apple 30 minutes after your meal to help break down the garlic.",
          "description":"There is an oxidizing enzyme in apples that, when ingested, will neutralize the odor-causing compounds in garlic. These compounds are called sulphides, and they release garlic\u2019s notoriously unpleasant odor once your body has started to digest the garlic. Waiting a little while before you eat the apple will allow the apple to neutralize the garlic smell as soon as it\u2019s released. You could also try eating an apple with your meal to prevent your breath from developing an unpleasant garlic smell in the first place. The smell of garlic may stay in your lungs for 24-48 hours (1-2 days) after you eat it. The solution to getting rid of garlic breath isn't as simple as washing your mouth out or brushing your teeth since the garlic smell isn't just in your mouth."

Just pour a little vinegar onto a clean sponge and scrub it across the surface of whatever kitchen items have an unpleasant garlicky smell. This works well on plastic cutting boards, frying pans, silverware, and even your stovetop. Also try pouring vinegar into a plastic spray bottle and spritzing it across larger items that smell like garlic. This works well for larger cutting boards and stovetops."
