To double the value further, other players may say rej (4x) on subsequent turns, followed by bok (8x) and then s\u0142up (16x) During the bidding, the partnerships are usually unknown. Therefore, if two people double consecutively, they can become partners, however, two doubles by the same team will only count as one double. For example, if all four players (re)double, once the players team up, the multiplier is only 4x, and not 16x. Wesele is announced when a player hold both black queens and is looking for a partner. They will be partnered by whoever hold the highest Jack (excluding themselves). They can also stay silent (cicha) or announce zolo (du) (see below)\n\nZolo (Du) is announced when someone has both black queens. That player will play against the other three players.
