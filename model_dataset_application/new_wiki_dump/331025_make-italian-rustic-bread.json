  "text":" Best to start at the beginning of the day, as proofing takes quite a while.  In a second large bowl sprinkle the yeast in to the warm water, swirl until the yeast starts to dissolve and let stand for ten minutes. This will let the yeast \u201cbloom\u201d. Add flour a cup at a time and incorporate vigorously in to the water. A wooden spoon serves nicely at first, toward the end you will need to use your hand. Work the dough around until all the ingredients are well combined and a dough ball forms. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside to rest for 30 minutes.  Generously flour your counter and scrape the fresh dough on to it.  Add salt and pour the sponge over the top, it is likely to be wet and sticky.  Knead by folding over and over again until the mixtures are smoothly combined, you can keep adding small amounts of flour until the dough is smooth and pliable. Continue to knead the dough for at least ten minutes. While the dough is resting on the counter thoroughly clean and dry both mixing bowls. Cut the dough in to two portions and place in each bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a medium warm to warm area. Let rise for one hour. Remove plastic and gently fold the dough over itself about four times, this will deflate the dough. Cover with plastic again and let stand another hour. Repeat the folding process two more times (total of three rise and fold cycles). Shape the loaves.  Prepare two large cooking sheets with parchment and sprinkle lightly with flour.  You should now have two big soft lovely dough balls approximately double the size of the deflated dough. Using kitchen shears to cut the dough into thirds. Generously flour the counter again and place the soft dough portion on the floured surface. Starting at the front edge of the dough, roll the dough firmly in to a rough football shape. You should compress the dough as you roll, tucking in the ends and shaping as you go. Gently transfer to the parchment, each sheet will hold three loaves. When you have all six loaves on the baking sheets cover loosely with plastic and set aside to rise again for one hour. After 45 minutes prepare the oven. Use three racks, one medium high, one medium low and one in the lowest position (a convection oven works best here). On the bottom rack place a jelly roll pan (cookie sheet with shallow sides) filled with water. Set the oven on convection at 450 and let the oven vigorously preheat for 15 minutes, creating a steamy environment. This is going to help create the crisp crust texture. Uncover the loaves; they should be double in size. Sprinkle generously with flour. Use a very sharp to knife deeply score the tops of the loaves, two or three diagonal cuts is fine. Flour the knife to avoid pulling the dough too much. Gently place pans in the steamy oven, cook at 450 for 15 minutes then reduce the oven temperature to 350 and cook for another 30 minutes.
