See our juicing guide if you'd like to make your own. Either way, you won't need much \u2014 a half cup or so is plenty for one or two bananas. Lemon juice is the most well-known juice used for keeping fruits from turning brown. It works just as well for bananas as it does for apples. However, there are many other juices that work well, including:\nLime juice\nOrange juice\nTinned pineapple juice\nTinned or fresh grapefruit juice\nApple juice"

          "description":"To do this, you can sprinkle the juice over the slices or dip the slices into the juice. You can also immerse the slices in the juice and leave them there for a few minutes, allowing them to soak up some of the juice. This can be great for keeping them fresh-looking but may affect their taste a little more than normal. Another quick way to coat the bananas is to put them in a sealed plastic bag with the juice and gently turn it over a few times. To minimize any change to the flavor of the bananas, use the juice sparingly or place it in a spray bottle and spritz it over the slices."

Whether you're eating the slices raw or making a pie, fruit kabobs, a parfait, or a fruit salad, you can trust that your bananas will look fresh well through the end of the meal. They should even last without refrigeration in a plastic container for a few hours \u2014 perfect for packed lunches. Even with the fruit juice, banana slices are best consumed the same day. The cold temperatures of refrigerators can turn the peels brown, but if you're OK with this, the fruit itself should remain fresh. If you do refrigerate the slices, be sure to put them in an airtight container with as little air in it as possible."

You can lighten discolored banana slices by immersing them in tinned pineapple juice or grapefruit juice for 10-15 minutes. They won't quite return to their original pale yellow color, but they will look fresher and more delicious."

Your best bet will usually be a health food store or a hardware store. Luckily, it is not especially expensive \u2014 less than $10 for a small bottle is common. To use citric acid, add three teaspoons to a cup of water and mix. Soak the slices in the bath as normal. Don't use undiluted citric acid, as it is far too sour."

          "description":"Since banana slices turn brown when they are exposed to the oxygen in the air, keeping the fruit from physically touching the air will prevent the browning reaction from occurring. There are many ways to do this. A few are listed below. One easy trick involves wax paper. Cut the slices so that they are all about the same slice, then lay them on a tray. Cut a square of wax paper to fit the tray, then lay it down over the slices and gently press it down so it sticks to each. The banana slices will be sandwiched between the paper and the tray without any air exposure. If you have the time, you can also cut small squares of wax paper of plastic wrap and lay them individually over each slice. Be sure to remove them before you eat. If you have a vacuum storage device (e.g., Food Saver, etc. ), you can also try packing the slices in an air-free container."
