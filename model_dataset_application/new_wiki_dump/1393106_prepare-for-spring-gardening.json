Place your compost area on solid ground off the side of your yard, and lay twigs and straw a few inches deep. Then, add organic material like leaves, branches, and food scraps. You can also add manure and grass clippings. Then, cover your compost with a piece of wood or plastic. A compost area is beneficial because you can easily add rich nutrients to your garden without spending much money. Having your own compost also recycles your organic waste."

If you find pests in your potting soil, replace it with a fresh mix. You can kill pests as you find them, and use garden pest control methods like sticky traps, oil sprays, and parasitic nematodes when needed. White vine weevil larvae live in compost and feed on plant roots. Keep an eye out for them as well!"

To install, place your water butt on a firm, flat surface, and measure the height of the butt and cut the downpipe to your measurements with a hacksaw. Then, place it against a wall under a downpipe. Once installed, the water butt will collect rainwater to distribute over your garden. Alternatively, you can cut a notch out of the downpipe and connect a rain trap to the pipe to transport your water. Rain barrels may also be a good option to connect to a downspout."

Fill your soil up to the indicated line in the test chamber, and add distilled water with a dropper. Wait 1-2 minutes for the soil test to complete. Do this for both nutrients and pH levels. To determine the levels, check the color of the indicator and match it with the key on your test kit. To make your soil more acidic, add sulfur, aluminum sulfate, or iron sulfate. To make your soil more basic, use powdered limestone or lime. If your soil is missing vital nutrients, add a fertilizer rich in that nutrient."

This helps turn the soil over and remove weeds from your garden. If your soil is dry or crumbly, you can use a shovel or digging fork to help break it up. If there are stubborn weeds still present, rip them out with your hands. Do this about 2-4 weeks before you plant your crops."

For best results, add a 1 in (2.5 cm) layer of compost. Heavy clay and sandy soils require more compost, spread a 4\u20136 in (10\u201315 cm) layer of compost and till it into the soil. You can scoop compost from an existing compost pile using a shovel, or you can purchase bags of compost material from a garden supply store."

If you tested your soil and found it lacking a particular nutrient, purchase fertilizer in that nutrient and use that on top of your compost. If your nutrients are balanced and want to add some extra material to your garden, go with grass clippings and mulch. Grass clippings and mulch both slow down weed growth and improve your soil moisture retention. Using mulch with compost can create exceptionally healthy soil."
