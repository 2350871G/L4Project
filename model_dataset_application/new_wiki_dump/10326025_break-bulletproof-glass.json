Maintain a safe distance from the target to avoid being hit by a ricocheting bullet. Make sure to also wear eye and ear protection when firing a handgun. If you\u2019re firing a high-powered handgun, increase this distance to 40\u201350 yards (37\u201346 m)."

          "description":"Some types of relatively thin bulletproof glass are designed to only withstand a single round of gunfire from a firearm. So, keep shooting, since multiple bullets impacting in the same location may be enough to break through a thin sheet of bulletproof glass. If you\u2019re shooting a mid-power handgun like a 9 mm, you may need to fire 3-5 rounds to break through thin bulletproof glass. However, a high-power handgun like a 44 magnum may penetrate with 2 shots. Be sure to wear noise-blocking earplugs and eye protection to avoid damaging your hearing or vision when firing a handgun."

          "description":"Aiming well is relatively straightforward whether you\u2019re shooting a handgun or a rifle. Line up the firearm\u2019s sights on the target and exhale slowly when you aim to keep the sights steady. Gently squeeze the trigger while shooting. Never jerk the trigger, or you\u2019ll ruin the shot. If you fire 8 rounds (a full magazine for most handguns), but they all hit different spots on the bulletproof glass, it\u2019s unlikely that the glass will break. Aiming accurately will prevent this from happening."

Thicker bulletproof glass can withstand quite a few rounds fired into it, so try emptying multiple magazines into the glass. The number of rounds needed to penetrate bulletproof glass can vary widely with the thickness and type of glass."

Also wear eye and ear protection whenever you\u2019re firing a gun, no matter the caliber. If you\u2019re shooting a rifle with a scope, you may be able to fire at the glass from as far as 100\u2013200 yards (91\u2013183 m) away. This will increase your safety."

          "description":"While high-powered handguns, like a .44 magnum or a .45, are more powerful than smaller handgun calibers, even these can\u2019t match the power of a rifle. Try using a standard rifle round like a .308 to break the glass. You\u2019ll certainly need a rifle to break tough polycarbonate or glass-clad polycarbonate glass. These rounds can be purchased at most gun or sporting goods stores. You could also shoot rounds of comparable power including the .270 Winchester and the .30-06. When you purchase polycarbonate or glass-clad polycarbonate bulletproof glass, look to see what caliber of ammunition it\u2019s rated to deflect. For example, if your glass will repel a .44 magnum round, rifle rounds more powerful than a .44 handgun should break the glass. Bulletproof glass is manufactured in 3 different types: acrylic, polycarbonate, and glass-clad polycarbonate. To make glass-clad polycarbonate, manufacturers laminate sheets of glass on either side of a sheet of polycarbonate to produce a heavy, effective material. You can identify this material by looking for the thin, laminated layers of plastic and glass that make up the composite polycarbonate."

          "description":"If a moderately powerful caliber rifle bullet like the .308 doesn\u2019t break bulletproof glass, try something a little more powerful. For example, a powerful .50 caliber rifle could penetrate thin bulletproof glass with 1 round, and could break thicker glass with several rounds. This should penetrate any type of polycarbonate glass. Other high-powered rifle calibers include the .460 Weatherby Magnum, the .700 Nitro Express, the .475 A&M Magnum, and the .338 Winchester Magnum. Polycarbonate glass is a type of plastic. You can identify polycarbonate by its transparency and weight. It\u2019s clear and weighs only about half as much as both acrylic and glass-clad polycarbonate."

While bulletproof glass isn\u2019t the same as armor, the armor-piercing rounds will still be more likely to break it than ordinary bullets. You can purchase armor-piercing rounds at a local gun or sporting goods store."

          "description":"As their name suggests, military-grade explosive rounds detonate on impact and will shatter the object they\u2019re fired into. This type of super high-power ammunition will break through even the thickest 5-pane bulletproof glass. Other types of armor-piercing or explosive rounds will also be more effective in shattering bulletproof glass than ordinary rounds. Experiment with various types of high-powered rounds to see what\u2019s most effective. Explosive rounds are harder to acquire than armor-piercing rounds. A gun or sporting-goods store may be able to special order a box."

Blunt objects like sledgehammers will not be able to break through polycarbonate or glass-clad polycarbonate bulletproof glass, but can break through acrylic material. If you\u2019re purchasing your own piece of bulletproof glass to break, you should be able to choose the type and thickness of the glass. Otherwise, you can identify acrylic glass by its location and appearance. Acrylic glass is actually made of very hard plastic.

Set these explosives within about 3 feet (0.91 m) of the glass to maximize their effectiveness. While some types of bulletproof glass are rated \u201cBlast resistant,\u201d they\u2019re likely not strong enough to withstand C4 or dynamite exploding only a few feet away. These types of explosives are also difficult\u2014and often illegal\u2014to come by. Unless you\u2019re in a position to legally and safely use dynamite or C4, stick to breaking glass with firearms.
