    {
      "headline":"See if you need the flexible rubber insert.",
      "description":"The rubber insert is used only if you don't have a thicker outer case on your device. The clock ships with the insert in, but can be removed for if your phone fits in the charger fine without it. Remember to save this insert if you should ever need it for other cases."

If you need to move the dock connector forward, plug the Lightning device into the phone's power area; then pull the connector forward as you position the device in the charger. Don't ever slam the connector into the phone. This alarm clock will only work with devices that use the Apple Lightning connector. The older Apple 30-pin connected devices should never be plugged into this machine, and won't charge or play your music using the Lightning dock."

If you don't have an iOS device to connect, hold the Time Set/Sync button down until \"Man\" flashes. Then press the Tune +/- (right hand side) switch until the all-caps Man displays, and release. Use the +/- to set the correct time, watching the display closely so to make sure you get the right AM/PM settings. Set the time by pressing and releasing the \"Time Sync/Set\" button again."

      "description":"Your device can automatically leave your radio/device on for a set amount of time and will automatically turn off after that time. It will work only if the radio has been turned on or your connected iOS device is currently playing music. At any point, if you disconnect your device, the sleep timer will turn off automatically. Your sleep timer can be set to turn off after 120, 90, 60, 30 or 15 minutes - each time you press the \"Sleep\" button, it changes. You can find this button in the bottom left corner of the buttons on the top of the device. When the Sleep Time has been activated, you can use the volume up/down buttons to change the volume. Setting your Sleep Timer volume won't change the volume for normal play, unless you separately change it during normal play mode. If you'd like to cancel the Sleep Timer and still leave your device playing, toggle through the timer options until \"Off\" is displayed, at which point the music will continue to play until you manually turn it off. The clock will learn your sleep timer pattern. On subsequent nights, you can just press the Sleep button once and see it not change your set time period.

Press and hold the buzzer button until the device flashes the currently set alarm time. If no alarm has been set, 12AM will flash. Press the +/- button to cycle through and find the time when you want the alarm to wake you up. If you'd like to use the music on your device to wake you up, you shouldn't need to change anything.

If wake to radio is selected, use the +/- buttons or presets to set the radio station desired. The volume control controls the FM radio alarm volume once set. The buzzer has two settings, HI and LOW.
