          "description":"You can purchase these from hardware stores and other retailers if you decide you want to kill the rats. Be aware that rat poison does not kill a rat instantly, it can take up to a week to kill the rat. The rat will be in immense pain during this week, so keep that in mind. Read the instructions and cautions carefully. Most rat poisons include warfarin, which causes internal bleeding and other drugs that kill rats, but can also be harmful to pets and people. Check the traps regularly. A rat corpse will give off an unpleasant odor if you do not remove it immediately. Traditional snapping traps are much more humane than rat poison, as it should kill the rat immediately. However, in some cases it can only severely injure the rat, in which case you should put it out of its misery.

MMPC is certified by the industry\u2019s leading codes and practices, including the National Pest Management Association (NPMA), QualityPro, GreenPro, and The New York Pest Management Association (NYPMA). MMPC's work has been featured in CNN, NPR, and ABC News. Kevin Carrillo\t\t\tMMPC, Pest Control Specialist\t\t\t\tSnap traps are generally more effective than poison. The problem with rat poison is that rats have a very sensitive palate and sense of smell, so the toxicity of rat poison has to be very low before rats will go anywhere near it. That means the poison has to build up in their body over time in order to be fatal. Also, if a rat eats the poison and dies quickly, they might be inside your walls, and you'll have an unpleasant smell in your home for several weeks."

These rats are not going to survive, as there\u2019s no way to get them off the glue board. Some rats will chew off their feet or legs in order to escape from the trap and others will get their head trapped in the glue and suffocate. It is not the most humane way to get rid of rats but it will work. If you find a rat in a glue trap that has not been killed, you'll have to stomp on it with a boot to kill it. It's either that or hitting it on the head with something hard like bat. Do whatever you can stomach and then toss the rat in an outdoor trash can."
