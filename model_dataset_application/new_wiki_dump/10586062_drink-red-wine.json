They have rich, fruity flavors that might remind you of strawberries, cherries, plums, and even watermelon. If you tend to have a sweeter palate, Merlots might be for you. Although not all Merlots are sweet, they tend not to have strong tannins, so they won't create the sensation in your mouth that dry wines are known for."

They can produce the flavors of raspberries, clove, licorice, cherries, blackberries, and plums. Some have hints of roasted tomato, beets, and rose petal. If you are looking for a red wine that encourages you to sit and ponder its flavor profile, Pinot Noir is for you!"

Their aroma often suggests a swirl of vanilla, jam, and oak. Zinfandels are another great way to begin your exploration of red wines. Their flavors are complex and bold. They also typically have high alcohol content."

They often have a smoky fragrance that is similar to unburnt tobacco. Usually, Tempranillos are fairly dry wines because they have an abundance of tannins.

Then lift up on the corkscrew until the cork is pulled from the bottle. Generally, wines with a screw top are cheaper and more vulnerable to aging. However, just because a wine has a screw top doesn't mean it's a bad wine!"

          "headline":"Serve the wine at room temperature, or slightly colder.",
          "description":"Most red wines should be served at about 60 \u00b0F (16 \u00b0C) degrees. If a red wine is served chilled, most of its flavors will be stunted. If it is served too warm, the taste of alcohol might overwhelm the wine's flavors. Store your red wine in a cool, dark place to maintain a decent temperature. There are a few red wines that are meant to be served chilled. These are typically sweeter dessert wines or concord blends. If you really want to get into red wines, consider purchasing a red wine fridge that will keep your wines good for longer!"

          "description":"When tasting a wine, a standard pour is around half the size of a normal pour. Typically, this means you will pour about 90 millilitres (3.0  fl oz). There should be plenty of room in the glass so that you can swirl the wine around and dip their nose into the glass without it touching the wine. A bottle of wine has roughly 10 tasting servings. For a party of 8-10 people, you will need at least two bottles of each wine that you want everyone to taste."

Additionally, you may leave smudges on the wine glass, which is never attractive! Most people hold the glass towards the base of the stem. Grip the stem with your thumb and index finger, and rest your remaining fingers on the base for stability."

Give the glass a good swirl to see if the wine forms \u201clegs\u201d that run down the side of the glass like raindrops. The clarity of a wine will tell you about the quality of its craftsmanship. If a wine is murky, it might have had some problems in the fermentation process or was unfiltered. The \u201clegs\u201d of the wine that are created by swirling it in a glass will tell you how rich and dense the wine is. The bigger the \u201clegs\u201d the bolder the flavors and alcohol content."

This brings out the scents and flavors in the wine. Stick your entire nose into the glass and inhale deeply. The senses of smell and taste are closely linked, so be sure to give the wine a good sniff between each sip. It's ok if you don't smell a lot at first! The more you smell wines, the more you'll learn to distinguish individual flavors, like fruity, smoky, and earthy tones."

          "description":"Hold enough wine in your mouth to completely cover your tongue. Lightly swish the wine around your mouth so that it coats your entire palate. Swallow the wine after it has been in your mouth for at least ten seconds. You can draw in some air between your teeth to further enhance the flavor. Your tongue only has the four basic tastes (sweet, salty, bitter, and acidic), so pulling air across the wine in your mouth will bring out the aromas that can be detected by the nasal passage along the back of your throat. This is sometimes called \u201cchewing\u201d the wine."

It also brings out the flavor in couscous, moussaka, goat cheese, and spicy Chinese food. Merlots tend to be lighter, fruity wines on the sweeter side of the spectrum. If you are eating something that is lighter and salty, chances are a Merlot will pair with it well."

          "description":"Mushrooms, truffles, and mild cheeses are ideal foods to eat with a Pinot Noir. Pinot Noirs often have a light body but have a lot of savoriness in their flavor, which balances and accentuates the earthy tones in your food. A drier, full-bodied Pinot Noir could also match well with roasted turkey or lamb."

Sharp cheeses like Double Gloucester, Aged Gruyere, Havarti, Gorgonzola are also great with a Zinfandel. If you like smoked meats or dishes that incorporate roasted tomatoes, try them with a Red Zinfandel. This accentuates the savoriness of both the wine and the food."

Indian Curries, spicy barbecue, and even hot wings can be greatly enhanced by a glass of Tempranillo. Cajun food, in particular, goes well with Tempranillo. Try it with some Jambalaya, Gumbo, or a Cajun-flavored steak. Tempranillos are difficult to pair with a cheese. If you really want to serve cheese a Tempranillo, get something soft and smokey like smoked provolone or brie."

          "headline":"Avoid the foods that don't pair well with red wine.",
          "description":"There are some foods that just don't work with red wines and can end up making both taste bad. This is usually because the flavors are either too similar or to contrasting. Usually, the foods that don't work well with red wine have a white wine that compliments them well. Unless you are drinking a dessert red wine like a port, chocolate doesn't usually pair well with red wine. This is because the tannins in the wine and the tannins in the chocolate combine for an overwhelmingly bitter taste. Brussel sprouts and asparagus both contain sulfur compounds that make red wine taste like it has gone bad. Even though these vegetables have earthy flavors you might think go well with a red wine, they can ruin your meal if you combine them. Red wines aren't generally paired with seafood. The iron in red wine attaches with fish oil to create a fishy, metallic aftertaste. Sushi, in particular, can be ruined by pairing it with a red wine."
