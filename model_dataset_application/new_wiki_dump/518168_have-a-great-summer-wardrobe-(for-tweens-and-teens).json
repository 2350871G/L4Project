Still some spring clothes but definitely enough summer, May and June are too late, all the cool summer clothes will be out in May and June, unless you live somewhere that those aren't summer months. So April is a good time. Go with your Mom and a friend. You might think why a mom? Your Mom was once your age too. Whether she is a good mom, fashionable or not, she knows what looks good on you. If your mom isn't fashionable, your friend will know something."

If you want to have a good summer wardrobe, don't underestimate the amount of money to spend. Check online to see what you like, and add it up on a calculator. Go $10-$20 above what you calculated, and then cut back on what you want.

Tank tops: make sure to have some simple and some fun ones. For summer breezy florals are always nice, lace is always springy, keep the fabric light, and your colors fun! It's summer, relax. 5 Crossovers between dressy-and-casual (Check out places like Anthropologie, or J crew for nice cross overs, find good deals at TJ Maxx)\n2 Short sleeved or quarter-length sweaters (just in case)\n\nBottoms:\nPairs of Khaki and Denim shorts! If you're into them, a lightly colored pair of cargo capris might be in now. (Try an army green, inspired by Balmain's new collection)\nA denim mini (not too short or ripped up, you don't want to look trashy)\n\nSwimwear:\nHave one or two swimsuits. It's nice to have one bikini and a one piece or tankini."
