Repurposing Vintage Books Attach books to the wall to use as shelves. Drill a couple small holes near the edge of one flap of your book, and buy L-brackets to attach the book to the wall as a shelf. Then place light objects on it like bud vases or small picture frames. Stack books to become a table. If you have a lot of old books, stack them into a column beside a couch or armchair to use as a side table.
