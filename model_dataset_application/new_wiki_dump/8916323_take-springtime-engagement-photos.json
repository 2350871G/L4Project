          "description":"Plan what you\u2019ll wear ahead of time. You don\u2019t need to be match perfectly, but wear outfits that complement each other\u2019s. Wear a solid that shows up in your partner\u2019s prints or plaids. Choose bright solids for spring. Decide if you\u2019ll both be formal or casual. Try matching your shirts to each other\u2019s shoes for a whimsical look. Add a colorful accessory that highlights the colors your partner is wearing. For example opt for a tie or scarf that pops with a bright color in their outfit."

If you want more than one outfit, choose one formal and one casual outfit. Mix it up by wearing a sweater or jacket that you can take off for a different look."

          "description":"Go for light colored clothes in pastels, whites, beiges, and grays. Bold, bright colors are also popular in the spring. Wear floral prints, light plaids, sundresses with a light sweater, blue suits, chambray, and khaki. Choose neutral colors if you\u2019re posing in front of a vibrant background, like a field of flowers. Spring is a great time to pick clothes that flow. Wear something that moves with you for a dynamic look in your photos."

Make sure that your clothes are flattering for your best look, especially because you\u2019re creating a keepsake of your engagement. Engage a stylist or a free personal shopper from a major department store if you need help choosing flattering pieces that reflect your style as a couple."

In the city, find budding trees or other spots of green to highlight the season, even if the focus is on you near a favorite landmark. If you have a favorite location, take some shots outside to take advantage of the spring weather. For example, if you love the theater, stand near the marquee on the street."

Avoid anything that might distract from your faces, like clothes with patterns that overwhelm you, or overlarge accessories or props."
