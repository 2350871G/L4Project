  "text":" Poaching the Chicken Place the chicken breasts in a large saucepan and fill it with cold water. Add just enough water until the chicken is covered by an inch. Allow the water to boil on medium-high heat.  Reduce the heat and allow the chicken to simmer for 15 minutes. Cover the saucepan with a lid while the chicken cooks. Check the chicken before removing. The breasts should be completely opaque once cooked. Cut the center of one breast and see the middle to ensure the chicken has fully cooked. Allow the chicken to cool until warm enough to handle.  Shred the chicken on a cutting board using two large forks.  Place the shredded chicken in a large bowl.  Making the Macaroni Stir and combine the hot sauce into the chicken.  Boil the dry macaroni elbows according to your package directions.  Make the cheese sauce. While the macaroni boils, whisk the milk and cornstarch in a small saucepan. Bring the heat to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. Add the butter and then slowly fold in the cheese. Whisk until the sauce is creamy and silky. Drain the pasta using a colander and gently toss it.  Pour the cooked pasta into a large bowl.  Fold in the cheese sauce and add the shredded chicken.  Sprinkle the blue cheese over the macaroni.
