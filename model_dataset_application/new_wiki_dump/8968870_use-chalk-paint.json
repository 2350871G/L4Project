Place the tape at the very edge of the thing you don\u2019t want to paint, creating a barrier between your brush and the surface you don\u2019t want painted. Get enough paint. There\u2019s nothing worse than starting a project and running out of paint halfway through. One liter of chalk paint can cover about 140 square feet (about 13 square meters). Make sure you measure the surface area you\u2019re painting before you buy the paint. Applying with a Brush Get a brush with long flexible china bristles. This allows the brush to pick up a good amount of paint. It also gives you a longer stroke, which means you can cover more area before you need to reload your brush. Dip the brush into the paint. Only dip the brush about halfway in to the can; you don\u2019t want so much paint on the brush that it drips a lot. Tap the brush against the side of the can to remove excess paint. Apply the paint in one direction. For example, if you\u2019ve decided to paint starting at the left of your piece, always move left to right. When you run out of paint, re-dip the brush, and then start by placing your brush just inside the paint you just applied and continue painting in the same direction. Each stroke should be a consistent size and use the same amount of paint. Applying with a Roller Brush Pour paint into a paint pan. Don\u2019t totally fill the pan, since you\u2019ll just have to pour it back in the can if you don\u2019t use all of it. Pour enough to cover the roller brush when you place it in the bottom of the pan. Leave part of the pan dry so that you can roll the brush against it before applying. Use a high density foam roller. A high-density roller will soak up a lot of paint without it dripping. For most chalk paint jobs, it\u2019s probably best to use a 9 inches (23 cm) mini roller. Dip the roller into the paint in the pan and roll it back and forth until it\u2019s coated. Scrape the brush on the grid of the pan. This gets rid of any excess paint on the surface of the roller. Don\u2019t scrape the roller brush too hard since this will get rid of most of your paint. Roll on a thin layer of paint. Then roll the brush back in the opposite direction, and once more in the original direction. This gives you good coverage that should cover up any brush lines. Applying with a Spray Gun Water down the paint if necessary. Not all paint guns can handle chalk paint because it can be a little thick. Add 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) (1 oz) of water to every cup (8 oz) of paint that you use in the paint gun. Operate the gun at high pressure. This is especially necessary if you choose not to water down the paint. Test the gun on a small, out-of-the-way area on your piece of furniture to get used to the pressure. Make sure that you have the right nozzle on the gun. A narrower nozzle will apply a higher stream of pressure. Hold the gun approximately 3 inches (7 cm) away from the furniture. Apply the chalk paint evenly, sweeping your arm back and forth in long, even movements. Finishing Chalkpainted Surfaces Apply a second coat as necessary. A second coat of chalk paint is not usually necessary, but it can help cover imperfections. It can also give you a two-tone look if you use a lighter shade or the same shade for the second layer. The bottom layer of paint will show through slightly, altering the color. Let the paint dry. Chalk paint dries relatively quickly, but if possible give it about two hours to dry totally. If you have applied a second coat, give it a full 24 hours to dry. Distress the surface. If you like the matte look of the dried chalk paint, keep it as is. For a more distressed look, use a medium-grit sandpaper and gently rub the surface, especially at the edges. Seal with wax. You can use clear or tinted wax. Gently massage wax into surface of the piece you painted with a soft wax brush. You should use a 500-mL tin of wax for every 3 to 4 liters (0.79 to 1.1 US gal) of paint you used. Work the wax in with the grain of the wood. Let the wax cure for at least 30 minutes or follow the instructions on the label. Buff the wax for a shiny finish. You can do this with a soft, clean cloth. Rub the cured wax surface in small, even circles until the surface shines. Replace the hardware. Once the wax is buffed, you can replace any hardware you removed to paint the piece. Be careful not to overtighten any screws, as this can scrape your paint up.",
