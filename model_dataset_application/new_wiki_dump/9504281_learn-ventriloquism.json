Choose a figure whose mouth you can move, and that can be animated in another way as well, like by moving their eyebrows or raising their hand. If you\u2019ve chosen a sports fanatic for your character, a human figure dressed in football pads and a jersey would work well. Look online for a wide range of available figures."
