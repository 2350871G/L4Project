You can also benefit from visiting cafes and coffee houses as part of the meeting circuit, which is a great way to get out and about and enjoy yourselves."

      "headline":"Start collecting some good books on coffee.",
      "description":"Look for books that detail the history, the manufacturing process, the methods for making coffee and coffee recipes. All sorts of books about coffee exist, so have a search through online sales for ideas. These books will serve as a source of information for members to prepare information sessions, write newsletters, decide on events to hold, etc. Offer to house the books and materials to begin with but be ready to institute a lending system as the club grows stronger."

Have new members suggest what they'd like to do and have a list of prompts to help guide the conversation. Things that the club might like to do include:\nTaste different coffees each meeting\nDo blind tastes for fun\nTry cooking with coffee and sharing the results with everyone\nPublishing a club newsletter with coffee tips and information\nGet bulk discounts on coffee purchases as a club\nVisit local cafes to enjoy different coffees styles\nRead or discuss information about coffee within each meeting\nPlan a tour of a coffee region in a year or so."
