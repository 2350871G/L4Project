Chlorine is volatile and will naturally dissipate in open ponds, but aeration will speed up the process considerably. Aeration does not work for chloramine, however, which is a less volatile additive used by some municipal water authorities. You\u2019ll need to add a dechlorination agent as well."

Adding the dechlorination agent requires unscrewing the bottle's lid, then turning the bottle upside down, allowing the proper amount to drip out. The water will be ready for immediate use. If you\u2019re using the water in a fish tank with a biological filter, choose a dechlorination agent that doesn\u2019t have an ammonia remover, which could cause problems in your filter."

Fish tanks typically require an air pump to circulate the water, so you\u2019ll get an aerating and chlorine removing agent as a bonus. Buy the appropriate pump for your tank\u2019s size and type, and the pets you\u2019ll be keeping in the tank."

Some activated carbon filters can be connected to your home\u2019s water supply, or you can buy a filtered pitcher that uses an activated carbon filter.

Reverse osmosis systems can be installed directly beneath your kitchen sink or where your water supply enters your home, and are therefore very convenient relative to other dechlorination methods. But they\u2019re also very expensive, often reaching several thousand U.S. dollars. Additionally, reverse osmosis filters are energy-intensive and produce large volumes of wastewater."

Boiling for at least 20 minutes will also remove chloramine, which is added instead of chlorine in some areas."

Over time, the chlorine in the water will dissipate due to exposure to the sun and air. The precise length of time needed to dechlorinate water using this method depends on the volume of chlorine you\u2019re attempting to remove and the amount of direct sunlight the water receives. Also, the wider and shallower the container, the faster the process will occur. Check the water regularly using a chlorine test kit to determine how much chlorine remains in the water.

Typically, you should treat chlorinated water using a UV light at the 254 nanometer wavelength that has a radiant energy density of 600 milliliters (20.3  fl oz) per 1 square centimetre (0.16 sq in). UV light will remove chloramine as well as chlorine. This is also a suitable dechlorination process for drinking water."
