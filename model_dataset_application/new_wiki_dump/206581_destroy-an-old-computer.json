You may wind up having to throw this item away, so make sure it is not a new or favorite item. The thicker the fabric is, the better. Ideally, the fabric will be able to remain intact when faced with glass, jagged metal, and other broken parts. A solid wool or cotton throw will work well, while you should stay away from linen."

A sledgehammer will be easy enough to wield and heavy enough to damage all of the complex components that make up your computer. Sledgehammers come in various sizes and weights. If you are nervous about holding a 10-pound (160 oz) hammer, you can likely find a 3-5 pound (48-80 oz) one at your local hardware store."
