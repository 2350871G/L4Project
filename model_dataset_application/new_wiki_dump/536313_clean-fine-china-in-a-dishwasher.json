          "description":"Start by examining your china to determine if it can withstand the dishwasher. Fine china can be classified into two types: porcelain china and bone china. Both types are kiln fired at high temperatures, so they are pretty durable and non-porous, meaning they may be able to withstand the occasional run in the dishwasher. Fine china that has been made recently, within 10-15 years, may be able to withstand the dishwasher. Some fine china makers will also note on the bottom of the china if it is dishwasher safe. If the china has a delicate gold or platinum gilding, you may not want to run them through the dishwasher, as these decorations can fade or react badly to high heat. Most china that is twenty years old or more are too delicate for the dishwasher or have patterns on them that are considered vintage. You may not want to risk damaging them by washing them in the dishwasher. As well, if the china is a family heirloom, you may want to consider hand washing the china instead."

You should also think about how forgiving your dishwasher is on normal plates and dishware. If it tends to be more punishing on everyday dishware, it may not be all that gentle on fine china either."

Never use regular non-dishwasher detergent inside your dishwasher; otherwise it'll break the dishwasher, as well as leave unremovable stains inside the remainder of the dishwasher and the dishes themselves. Avoid liquid detergents that are lemon-scented or contain bleach, as the acids in these ingredients can be harsh on the surface of the fine china."
