Look for circular, heart-shaped or oblong nuts that are either slightly flat or rounded. Depending on the species, hickory nuts can have any of these shapes. Taste the nut meat. Several hickory species yield a sweet, edible meat, while others yield bitter meat that one should not eat. Look for a densely veined inner chamber.
