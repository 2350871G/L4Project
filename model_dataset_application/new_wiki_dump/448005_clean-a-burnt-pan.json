Turn off the heat and let cool enough that you can safely touch the pan and water. You can replace the dish soap with a small spoonful (or crumbled tablet) of dishwasher detergent. This may discolor aluminum. Try a different method first when cleaning a cast iron pan, since soap will remove most of your hard work seasoning."

          "description":"If necessary, add more hot, soapy water whenever the old water cools down. Scrub using a tool that won't damage your pan's material:\nEnamel, anodized aluminum, or Teflon pan: Use a sponge, nylon brush, or Dobie pad (sponge with protective plastic netting). Stainless steel, copper, or non-anodized (shiny) aluminum pan: Start with gentle options above, then move on to a scouring pad or copper wool. Use a light touch and scrub under the water level to minimize scratches."

Let cool and scrub the stain away. Baking soda will react with and ruin aluminum. Because of its abrasive properties, it is not recommended for Teflon or other non-stick surfaces either."

          "headline":"Make a paste from cream of tartar and vinegar.",
          "description":"This will probably scratch your pan, but at this point you're running low on options. Pick up some cream of tartar from a grocery store's baking aisle if you don't have any. Sprinkle it over the pan and stir in a few drops of vinegar until you get a thick paste. Let sit for ten minutes. Scrub hard to remove the stain, or add more vinegar and bring it to a boil yet again. Many people use baking soda and vinegar for cleaning, but despite the dramatic fizz, this mixture quickly turns into neutral water. Cream of tartar has similar abrasive cleaning properties to baking soda, but stays stable in vinegar, letting you benefit from acidic cleaning as well."

This one has been going around the internet for a long time, but actual results aren't always promising. It seems to get the best results on burned sugar, but this is only based on a few anecdotes."

If this doesn't work, try leaving the pan in a trash bag for 24 hours to give the ammonia fumes time to break down the stain. Ammonia will ruin aluminum pans."
