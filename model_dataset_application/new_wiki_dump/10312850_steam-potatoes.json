  "text":" Using a Steamer Basket Wash the potatoes thoroughly. To do this, simply vigorously scrub the outside of the potatoes with a scrub brush and water to remove any dirt or chemicals. You don\u2019t need to peel the potatoes. In fact, leaving the skins on will help them keep their shape once they soften. Boil 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.6 cm) of water in a pot with a steamer basket. A metal sieve or colander can be used in place of a steamer basket. Make sure the water is not touching the steamer basket. Place the potatoes in the steamer basket with the largest ones on the bottom. The smaller ones can then go on top. If your potatoes don\u2019t all fit in the steamer basket at once, cook them in batches. You may want to cut the larger potatoes be the equivalent size of the smaller ones.

Use a scrub brush to get rid of dirt or debris on the skins. Don't soak the potatoes as this can actually remove some of their nutrients. There's no need to peel the potatoes.
