  "text":" Mixing the Ingredients Tip the flour, sugar and ginger into the mixing bowl.  Add the butter. Mix by hand until the mixture forms crumbs. Add the raisins or sultanas. Stir to coat in flour. Mix the milk and baking soda together in a small bowl. Add the treacle and stir thoroughly. Steaming the Pudding Pour the mixture into the greased pudding basin.  Cover the open end of the bowl with a pleated piece of greaseproof paper. Top with a greased layer of kitchen foil. Tie the covers on with a ring of string. Then tie string around the bowl to form lifting handles. Place the bowl into a steamer. If you don't have a steamer, make one from a dish or pan larger than the pudding basin and fill to halfway of the basin with boiling water. This will need to be put into the oven and steamed at around 180\u00baC/350\u00baF. Steam for 2 hours. Check every quarter hour or so for the water level; if needed, top up with more boiling water. (Be very careful when doing this.) Serving the Pudding Remove the pudding from the steamer with care. Undo the cover and tip the pudding out onto a serving plate. The serving plate should be warmed before adding the pudding to it. Serve immediately. This pudding can be served with whipped cream, ice cream, ginger syrup or other tasty choices.",
