The only problem with this is that it takes up space. The reason I like to do this is because the plants have sun but when it's raining you can turn on the lights and they will still get the things they need."

      "description":"After you've found your spot and planted your plants, you need to set up the lights. Fluorescent light bulbs have both of the rays that are needed to make plants grow. Fluorescent light fixtures can be bought at your local home department store such as Home Depot or Lowe's. The only thing is that when you hang them they are on pulleys so you can adjust them as the plants grow. If they are not on pulleys, you can stack books under the box when you hang the lights and remove them as the plants grow taller. Plants should have 12 to 16 hours of steady light daily."
