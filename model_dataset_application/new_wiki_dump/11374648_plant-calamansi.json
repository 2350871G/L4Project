          "description":"If you live in a place where you have access to calamansi fruit, you can buy some fruit and save the seeds. Remove the outer, pulpy layer of the seeds. Each fruit has around 5 seeds. If you don't have access to calamansi fruit, try looking for seeds online. To remove the calamansi seeds without cutting through them, cut through the top 1/3 of the fruit rather than the center. Use the seeds right away after removing the outer layer. They still need to be moist to grow. If you bought the seeds rather than removed them from a plant, they probably have the outer layer removed already."

          "description":"Dampen a paper towel with a few drops of water. Place the seeds in the center of the towel and fold it so that the seeds are enveloped inside. Alternatively, you can place the seeds directly into damp potting soil, just deep enough to be completely covered by the soil."

Place the bag somewhere warm, such as a windowsill that gets a lot of sunlight or on top of a refrigerator. If you put the seeds directly into the soil, cover the pot with plastic wrap to create a warm, humid environment."

          "description":"Check the seeds after 3 days. Any seeds that have sprouted can be moved to a small pot to continue growing. Fill the pot with potting soil and plant the sprouted seeds just underneath the surface. Water the soil so that the top 1 inch (2.5 cm) is damp. For seeds planted in a pot, remove the plastic wrap once the seeds have sprouted. You may need to wait an extra day or two for the seeds to sprout."

As soon as a seedling has 2 fully-grown leaves, you can move it into its own pot. Gently remove it from the soil so that you don't break the roots. Always water seedlings thoroughly, so that the potting soil is damp all the way through, when you transplant them to a new pot. Young plants need more water to grow than mature plants."

Place the seedling in a larger pot and fill it in with well-draining soil. Water the seedling so that the soil is damp all the way through. The seedling should be planted around 2 inches (5.1 cm) deep in the soil."

          "description":"Calamansi plants need to be watered whenever the top layer of soil dries completely out, which could be daily or several times a week, depending on humidity levels. Calamansi also requires full sun for healthy growth, meaning it needs to be exposed to sunlight for 6-10 hours a day. Use soil that drains well for calamansi, as this plant doesn't like having damp roots. If you can't expose your calamansi plant to full sun, you can use grow lights indoors."

Find your USDA hardiness zone by visiting https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/ and entering your zip code. If you live in a zone with a number lower than 9b, it's better to grow calamansi inside, or in a container that you can move inside for winter. In the US, acceptable regions to grow calamansi outside include parts of California, Texas, Florida, and Hawaii."

Plant your calamansi in a 3 by 3 inches (7.6 by 7.6 cm) deep hole in sandy soil, in a location that receives full sun. Move the cutting carefully so that you don't damage the roots. Water the cutting after you move it. Only move your calamansi outside if you live in a tropical location. If you are in an area that doesn't get a lot of rain, water your newly transplanted cutting every time the soil dries out completely until it is fully grown. Don't add fertilizer right away. Wait 3-4 months, and fertilize 4 times a year."
