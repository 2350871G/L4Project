Do this until there is no longer any dirt or other visible residues on the skin. Do not use soap, bleach, or specialty fruit washes. They are not more effective than running water. If you do not have a vegetable brush, use a new toothbrush. Do not use your hands. Avocado skins are grooved and may be covered with artificial wax that can trap pathogens. It is impossible to get all the trapped bacteria out with only your hands."

Brown spots and bruises are conducive to bacterial growth, so picking avocados with unblemished skins will help you avoid overly contaminated fruits. Make sure to avoid bruising your avocados after you buy them so that you are not introducing bacteria into the fruit. Do not place heavy objects on or around avocados in the shopping bag, and store them somewhere where they will not be crushed."

Plastic cutting boards accumulate knife grooves over time, and these grooves can trap bacteria. It is impossible to clean this bacteria out by hand, so use the dishwasher to clean plastic cutting boards after every use. Wooden cutting boards cannot be put in the dishwasher, but they are more sanitary because bacteria is absorbed into the wood and eventually dies.
