          "description":"Start your smoothie with a liquid base. It should be added to your blender first before the fruits, vegetables, or other ingredients. This helps protect the blades as well as helping things blend well. The ratio of the liquid base to the fruits and vegetables should be for every 2 cups of liquid base, add about \u00be  cup of fruit, vegetables, or other ingredients. You can add more fruits and vegetables if you want, especially if they are juicier. For a low-calorie smoothie, instead of piling in a lot of high calorie fruits, choose one or two fruits, a green, a protein, and some spices. Balance high calorie fruits, like bananas and pineapple, with lower calorie fruits, like berries. Instead of one cup of nut milk, consider using \u00bd cup of skim milk and \u00bd cup of water to reduce calories. Add ice at the end if you want to cool your drink, give it a frozen treat consistency, and thin it out."

If you want to use dairy milk, make sure to use a lower calorie version, like 2% or 1%. Use unsweetened nut milks instead of sweetened nut milks or dairy milks to save calories.

You can add just about any fruit or vegetable you want. For lower calorie smoothies, load up on veggies and limit fruits. Some good ideas for vegetables include any dark leafy greens, like kale or spinach, carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes, avocados, or beets. Almost any fruit makes a good smoothie. Try berries, melons, bananas, pineapple, pears, peaches, mangos, and kiwis. You can buy prepackaged smoothie packs in the freezer section of your grocery store. You can also freeze your own produce.
