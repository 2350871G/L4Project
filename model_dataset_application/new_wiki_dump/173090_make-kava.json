  "text":" Using Ground Kava Root Find quality kava. Local stores might sell it or you can order some online. There are many different kinds of kava and one brand may be stronger than another. Imports from Vanuatu or Fiji tend to be strongest. For this method you will need ground kava root but other forms exist. Mix the kava powder in water but remove the kava root before drinking. You can do this with a large teabag or filter the drink latter. If you don't mind the taste and want some extra fiber you can leave the kava in your drink. The amount of kava depends on your taste -- more kava means a more potent drink. As a general rule use one heaping tablespoon for every cup of water used. Some people like to add vegetable oil or a cup of milk (e.g. 2 cups water, 1 cup milk, 3 tablespoons kava). Using a Strainer Add kava directly to water and mix. You can use a blender for larger quantities or a spoon if you're making one cup. Let the water and kava mix for at least 10 minutes. Give your blender a couple breaks though during the 10 minutes. Filter kava with a strainer (wire mesh, cheesecloth, or an old shirt). Coffee filters don't work. Kneading the Kava Get a shallow bowl and fill it with a desired amount of water (eg 3 cups or more).  Put a square cloth in the bowl and fill with desired amount of kava.  \"Knead\" kava through the water without letting the kava escape into the bowl. When done lift out strainer and squeeze any remaining water out.",
