          "description":"Most chef's knives are between 6 and 12 in (15 and 30 cm) long. If you're an occasional cook, start testing an 8-in (20 cm) chef's knife. Longer knives will require more experience and muscle training than shorter chef's knives. Consider what you usually use a chef's knife to accomplish. For example, if you frequently cut watermelon, a 6-in (15 cm) chef's knife probably won't be long enough."

          "description":"The blade material will determine how sharp the blade is and how durable the knife is. Think about the benefits and disadvantages of these materials:\nHigh-carbon steel makes sturdy blades that keep an edge and won't discolor, but it's more expensive than standard stainless steel. Stainless steel is less expensive and won't rust, but it's hard to keep the blade sharp. Ceramic blades keep a sharp edge for a long time, but they can break easily. Titanium blades are light and keep a sharp edge, but they're too flexible for cutting into hard or dense foods."

          "headline":"Determine if you want a stamped or forged blade.",
          "description":"If you'd like a hefty blade that's durable and long-lasting, choose a blade that's been forged. A forged blade is poured into a mold and the blade runs the length of the handle. For an inexpensive chef's knife, choose a blade that's been stamped out of a sheet of steel. Stamped blades aren't as strong as forged blades, so they're more likely to break."

          "headline":"Consider how heavy you want the knife to feel in your hand.",
          "description":"Because knives are made with different metals, some chef's knives are heavier than others. Some people might choose a knife that weighs more so it bears down more when chopping. You might prefer a light knife if you just use the chef's knife for occasional slicing and dicing. Look for heavier knives if you spend a lot of time chopping or breaking down meat with bones."

          "description":"Although chef's knives are often known for their wide blades, some have more of a pronounced curve from the base of the blade to the tip. A very curved blade will lend itself to a large rocking motion. Try a variety of shapes to see which you prefer. A lot of the style preference stems from how you use the knife. If you chop more than you slice, you may prefer a narrower blade."
