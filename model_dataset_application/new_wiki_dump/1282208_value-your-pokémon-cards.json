While this isn't the only thing that determines a card's a value, it's probably the biggest. Look in the bottom right corner of the card to find the rarity symbol, next to the card number:\nA circle means the card is common, while a diamond marks uncommon cards. These are easy to find, and not usually worth much unless the card was printed in 1999 or 2000. A star means the card is rare, while a star H or three stars are special, extra-rare cards. These rarities have the highest potential to be valuable, so separate them from the rest of your collection. Other symbols typically mean the card was sold as part of a special product, not a booster pack. Try looking up the card as a \"Promo\", \"Deck Kit\", or \"Boxtopper\" version to check the price. These can range in price from a few cents to over $100, depending on the product."

This doesn't automatically make it valuable, but a rare holo (or reverse holo) is definitely worth setting aside. Some special cards have a holographic border around the whole card, but no other holographic portion. These are also potentially valuable, and can be identified more closely using the guidelines below."

Check for card names followed by ex, \u2606, LV.X, LEGEND, or BREAK. Other extra-rare cards called \"SP\" for \"Special Pok\u00e9mon\" have names followed by a stylized G, GL, 4, C, FB, or M.

If the collector number begins with \"SH,\" the card is one type of \"Shining Pok\u00e9mon,\" with different art than the regular version. These are all also reverse holographic cards. If there is no collector number, the card is probably an early printing, although Japanese cards continued to not display the number for a while longer. Not all of these are worth anything, but it's worth checking."

Try a Pok\u00e9mon card-selling site or eBay, or search online for (your card name) + \"selling\". Remember to include any special features, using the terms described in the identification section. Most online listings show how much a company is selling cards for. Look for a \"buylist\" to see how much the company will pay to buy your cards.
