Two players will face off from opposite sides of the board, but it doesn't matter which sides you use. Once your board is in place, you can arrange your pieces with the characters facing your opponent."

You'll place the pieces with the black side up at the beginning of the game. Later, players can \"promote\" their pieces to give them new powers. Once a piece is promoted, it loses its former capabilities and can only move according to its new powers. Pieces cannot be demoted during the game unless they are captured and removed from the game board. At the start of the game, make sure each game piece has the black side facing up.Tip: Unlike in chess, opposing sides aren't marked by different colors. Instead, the pieces have the same colors and markings, and the opposing sides are identified by the direction they're facing."

Be careful not to move your King to a space that puts it at risk of being checkmated. Each player has 1 King. The King does not have promoted moves.Tip: Like with Western chess, the goal of Shogi is to checkmate (in Japanese \"Tsumi\") your opponent's King.

Similarly, Bishops can move diagonally through all open spaces. Each player has 1 Rook and 1 Bishop. Both the Rook and the Bishop move in the same way as in Western chess.

Then, remove the captured piece from the board and place it to your right to keep it handy for later use. Capturing pieces is optional, but it makes your opponent\u2019s side weaker and gives you pieces to drop back into play. You will need to protect your pieces from becoming captured by blocking your opponent's moves. In Japan, captured pieces are traditionally placed on a special platform called a \u201ckoma.\u201d"

Making a standard, non-dropped move that begins or ends in this area gives you the option to promote the move by turning the piece over onto its red side. Once a piece is promoted, it remains flipped until it\u2019s captured or the game ends. Every piece but the King and Gold General has a promoted side. Promotion is optional in most cases.

Once captured, pieces become known as \u201cpieces in hand.\u201d You have an option each turn to put one of your \u201cpieces in hand\u201d back into play by \"dropping\" it onto an unoccupied square. This can only be done in place of a regular move, and pieces can only be dropped into open spaces on the board. When you drop pieces, they\u2019re always turned to the \u201cstandard\u201d side, even if you drop them into the promoted territory. You can\u2019t drop a pawn into a column where you already have an unpromoted pawn. However, it\u2019s okay to drop a pawn into a column where you have a promoted pawn.Tip: Just as you can drop your \u201cpieces in hand\u201d into a \u201ccheck\u201d position, you can also drop them into the path of danger to protect your King, if possible."

Putting your opponent on constant defense by repeatedly attacking their King is a great strategy for winning the game.

Additionally, you\u2019ll usually call a draw if the same position has occurred during 4 consecutive moves.
