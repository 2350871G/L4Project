Moving is stressful and taking the time to make your place cozy and familiar will help relax you and make you feel settled. Create a timeline for yourself if you like. Tackling one room at a time is a good strategy and finishing two rooms per week should suffice. One of the easiest and least expensive ways to decorate a new apartment and add some atmosphere is to paint. Make sure you're allowed to paint inside your apartment, and then use color on one wall or a couple of walls to accent your home. Hang familiar paintings, photographs and decorations. These will make you feel more at home and are an inexpensive way to jazz up your space. Carpets and rugs can enlarge or make a space feel more cozy, and can also dampen noise. Add small touches such as plants or candles. For example, placing a row of candles across a table or buying a few inexpensive plants and plant pots can add a lot of atmosphere to your apartment. Remember that everything doesn\u2019t have to match. It often looks much cooler and homier to have furniture and decorations that complement one another but don\u2019t match exactly."
