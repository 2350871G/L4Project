          "description":"Bridge is a four-player game played in teams of two players each, so your significant other and another couple are a good potential choice. Teams sit across from each other around a square table. For purposes of notation, each side of the table is given the name of a cardinal direction. Thus, the players in a bridge game are commonly referred to as North, South, East, and West. North and South play on a team against East and West."

          "description":"Bridge is played with a standard 52-card deck in deals of 13 cards per player, so that the entire deck is dealt out each hand. After the deck is dealt, players make bids. The final bid determines the importance of each suit as well as the overall goal for each deal. Deals are then played card-by-card in 13 sub-rounds known as \u201ctricks.\u201d The goal of the game is to win 7 or more tricks on each deal in order to score points. Deals continue until one team accumulates a predetermined number of points. Scoring systems vary from style to style and group to group. Players typically take turns in a clockwise fashion. This means that actions alternate evenly between the two teams."

Aces are high in bridge, followed by kings, queens, jacks/knaves, tens, and finally spot (number) cards from 9 to 2. The more cards in a suit you have, and the higher the value of those cards, the better luck you are likely to have with them. Keep this in mind as bidding begins."

        {
          "headline":"Make bids and award the contract.",
          "description":"Teams bid numbers and suits, which represent the number of tricks they believe they can win on the deal if the suit attached to that number becomes the trump suit (the suit of cards that will be more valuable than the other 3 suits during tricks). Whoever deals will get to bid first, and bidding rotates clockwise from the dealer around the table, continuing for as many rounds as is necessary to settle on a final bid. Whichever team ends up bidding the highest number wins the right to name the trump suit. There are many rules and special terms governing the bidding phase; this guide will cover the basics required to play a friendly game. A minimum of 7 tricks are required to win each deal. (This is because there are 13 tricks per deal, and a majority must be won to win the deal.) Bridge players therefore traditionally count bids starting from the seventh trick, referring to the first 6 tricks collectively as \u201cthe book.\u201d If your team wants to bid 7 tricks (saying that you expect to win 7 of the 13 tricks for the current deal), you would announce a bid of 1, and so on up to a bid of 7 for winning all 13 tricks. You can remember this easily by adding 6 to whatever number is bid to get the actual number of tricks that must be won to \u201cmake\u201d (complete) the contract. You can't ever bid to win less than 7 tricks (a bid of 1). Suits are important during bidding. The power of the suit you bid will determine how many other cards will be able to outbid it. The suits are ranked from most powerful to least powerful as follows: spades, then hearts (these are known as the \u201cmajor\u201d suits), then diamonds, and finally clubs (the \u201cminor\u201d suits). Each new bid must be more \u201cvaluable\u201d than the last bid before it, so if the person before you bid 1 in hearts, you must either bid 1 in spades or 2 (or more) in any other suit to beat it. It is often advisable to bid on the most common suit in your hand, even if it is relatively weak. For example, if your hand has six cards with the diamond suit, you might lean towards bidding for diamonds to become the trump suit. Pay attention to the bids your partner makes to get an idea of what he or she is holding as well. No trump bids: In addition to bidding for a trump suit, you can declare a bid of \u201cno trump\u201d (sometimes condensed as \u201cnotrump,\u201d and abbreviated NT), which indicates you are only bidding a number, not a suit. If you win a no trump bid, tricks are played without a trump suit, meaning only the highest ranked card in each trick can win it. This is riskier than naming a trump suit, but making (completing) a no trump contract will score your team more points than a regular contract. For bidding purposes, NT is considered the highest \u201csuit;\u201d therefore, the highest possible bid is 7NT. Beware of overreaching on your bid. If your team wins a bid and is subsequently unable to make that number of tricks by the end of the deal, you must pay the opposing team a number of points from your own total, which can quickly change the balance of power. You do not have to bid. You can pass a bid to the next person instead. If three players pass in a row, the last bid wins the contract and determines the trump suit; if all four players pass without any bids at all, the deck is reshuffled and the hands dealt out a second time. There are special terms for each player once a contract has been awarded. The person who made the winning bid is called the \u201cdeclarer,\u201d and his partner is called the \u201cdummy.\u201d The other team are collectively calle the \u201cdefenders.\u201d Knowing these terms makes it easier to keep track of the flow of the game."

          "headline":"Begin the first trick.",
          "description":"Now that a trump suit (or a bid of no trump) has been established for the deal, the tricks begin. Play begins with the defender to the left of the declarer. The defender \u201cleads\u201d the trick by placing a card face up on the table. The suit of this card is the suit for the trick, which means that players can only win the trick with a card of that suit, or a trump suit card. The other two suits don't count during this trick. Once the trick has been led, the dummy spreads his or her entire hand out on the table, usually in four columns organized by suit. The dummy's hand is played by the declarer for the rest of the deal. Defenders play normally. The dummy has an unusual role. The dummy cannot comment on the strategic decisions of the declarer, but is allowed to point out when the declarer would accidentally violate a rule of the game. Otherwise, he or she leaves the decisions to the declarer for the duration of the deal. Lead suit cards must be played if possible. For example, if the suit of the lead card is clubs, and you have a club in your hand, you must play it rather than any other card. If you don't have any cards in the leading suit, you may \u201cruff\u201d (play a trump suit card, assuming it is different from the lead suit) or \u201csluff\u201d (play a card from one of the two remaining suits). A ruff is likely to win the trick, as any card from a trump suit beats every card of every other suit. A sluff is functionally the same as a pass, and cannot ever win the trick."

Your partner can support your bid by bidding a higher number in the same suit as your bid (signaling that he or she is also happy with the suit), or suggest a different approach by bidding a different suit.
