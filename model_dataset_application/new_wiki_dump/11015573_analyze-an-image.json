          "description":"The context of an image typically refers to the physical place or publication in which you came across the specific image. Try asking yourself: who can see this image, and where will they see it? Think about other images that appear near the primary image (whether it's in an art gallery or a magazine) and the ways they add meaning to the image's context. For example, you\u2019re likely to come across many images used for advertisements in magazines and websites. The specific magazine or site will determine the image\u2019s context. If you visit a site like teenvogue.com, you\u2019re most likely to come across images that appeal to young people. You\u2019ll typically come across artistic images in a completely different context, like an art gallery or art publication."

          "description":"Nearly all images have an audience: a group of people that the image\u2019s creator intended for the image to be seen by. Ask questions about the image that can help you figure out the audience. For example, what kinds of people appear in the image: men, women, children? Or, if there are no people, look at the image\u2019s subject matter to assess the audience. For example, an advertisement image of a man running with a hiking shoe superimposed over the photo is likely intended to be seen by male hikers. Or, a large photograph of a landscape hanging in an art gallery is probably intended to be viewed by art enthusiasts of diverse ages and genders."

          "headline":"Take note of the image\u2019s emotional effect to understand its purpose.",
          "description":"The way an image makes you feel can give you clues about its purpose. Advertisements are an easy example, since their purpose is pretty straightforward. The purpose of an image on an advertisement is to engage your interest and create a desire for the product. Each kind of image has its own purpose, and some images have many purposes. In a landscape painting, the purpose may be to cause you to calmly reflect on the beauty of nature. But, in a violent photograph taken during wartime, the purposes may be both to remind you of the depravity of war and to make you respect the sacrifices that soldiers often make."

          "headline":"Note your gut-level response to an image to understand its tone.",
          "description":"The tone of an image has to do with the way it makes you feel. Ask yourself: is the image happy and uplifting, dark and scary, or mysterious and shady? Tone is a complex thing, and has to do with the subject matter of an image, lighting used, and the visibility of the background. Tonal differences can account for 1 picture of a clown being silly and fun, while another image of a clown is creepy and evil. For example, a candid photograph of a bounce house at a child\u2019s birthday party would be tonally light, fun, and silly. On the other hand, a painting of a homeless person sleeping on the steps of a library in winter would be tonally sad, and may even have a dark or depressing tone."

          "headline":"Think about how color is being used in the image.",
          "description":"Some images are in color while others are black and white. Regardless of the amount of color in an image, color can provide visual interest and emotion. It can also draw your eye towards or away from certain parts of an image that its creator may want you to pay more or less attention to. Muted, pastel colors can make an image seem calm or nostalgic, while sharp, electric colors can give an image energy and pizzazz. For example, say you see an advertisement for a dress in which everything is rendered in shades of gray except for the dress, which is dazzlingly red. The image probably wants to draw your eye to the dress, and to make it seem important, bold, and sexy."

          "headline":"Examine the size and placement of text on the image.",
          "description":"Many images\u2014especially mixed-media artwork and advertisements\u2014have text on them. Text can give you a lot of information about an image. Look at its size, typeface, and orientation for clues about what meaning the text adds to the image. Is the text simply providing information? Or is it meant to be funny, sarcastic, or part of a collaged artwork? For example, say that a whiskey advertisement has large, crisp wording that says, \u201cGood to the last drop.\u201d That tells you the image is promotional, and portrays a product being sold. On the other hand, a drawing of a political leader with a phrase like \u201cthe blind leading the blind\u201d scrawled across their face is likely intended as political satire."

          "headline":"See if the image\u2019s foreground and background work together.",
          "description":"In many images, the foreground and background seem to complement one another, and contain naturally associated items. In other images, though, the background of a photo may contrast with what\u2019s in the foreground. This can give you insight into the image-creator\u2019s understanding of the image\u2019s subject. The foreground of an image contains whatever\u2019s closest to the observer, and the background contains scenery and objects farther away. For example, say someone took a photo of a political leader. If there were flags or saluting soldiers in the background, it\u2019d be clear that the leader deserves respect and praise. If, however, there were rows of gravestones or coffins in the background, it would seem that the image is criticizing or making fun of the politician."

          "description":"The location of different people, lettering, or other visual components can tell you a lot about what the image is doing. Since people in the Western world are used to reading from left to right (and top to bottom), our eyes naturally first see whatever is on the left side of a painting. Things in the bottom-right corner are typically less important. Say you\u2019re looking at a photo of an impressive mountain. The photographer may situate the peak in the top-left corner of the image to highlight its importance. On the other hand, the photographer may locate the peak on the far right side of the image, to emphasize the clouds, birds, or other elements on the left side of the painting."

          "description":"Light is important in any image that\u2019s meant to convey a real-life setting. Light can have a strong effect on the tone of an image, and the way an image-maker plays with light and darkness can conceal or reveal different parts of an image. Different lighting could even make the same image mysterious and creepy when poorly lit and warm and welcoming when brightly lit. For example, an image of a cathedral in the warm light of evening may evoke a feeling of calm contemplation. Alternately, a high-contrast image of a brightly-lit rock concert will convey energy, volume, and a little rebellion."

The same goes for paintings and drawings. The perspective or point of view can give you a great deal of insight into how the image\u2019s maker wants to present the subject of the image. For example, say you\u2019re looking at a painting of a policeman. If the perspective is from the ground looking up, the officer will appear powerful,\nBut, if you were to see a painting of an officer with a perspective point of view 10 feet (3.0 m) in the air, the cop would appear small, weak, and unimpressive."

Pay attention to the way that a subject is positioned within the image. If the subject is a person, different ways they\u2019re positioned within the image could make them seem serious, sexy, threatening, weak, lazy, or energetic. For example, an illustration of a husband and wife centered in the frame but looking in opposite directions could indicate marital problems. You can also tell a lot from checking out the subject\u2019s clothing, posture, and facial expression."

When you look at an image, ask what artistic choices the creator made to give the image a unique visual spin. Then ask yourself what the stylized image conveys that a non-stylized image couldn\u2019t. For example, say you\u2019re looking at an ad for a sports car and see that the road, background, and driver\u2019s features have been smudged out. This stylistic choice was most likely made to draw your attention only to the car being advertised."

In many cases, the image\u2019s source can give you information about the image and the reasons for its creating. Understanding the source can also let you know if an image is reliable and what tone it\u2019s meant to have. Say you find a Victorian-era photo of a ghost. Understanding the image\u2019s source and the ways in which \u201cghost\u201d photos were created by Victorians will help you understand that the photo isn\u2019t of a real ghost and may have been intended as a prank. Or, say you\u2019re looking at a film still image of an oil spill. Knowing that the image was made by environmentalist filmmaker will give you some insight into what mood the image is intended to convey."
