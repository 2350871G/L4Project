  "text":" Cleaning Your Jeans in the Tub Fill your bathtub or utility sink with cool to lukewarm water. Make sure the area is clean and that you run enough water to fully submerge your jeans. Wash dark jeans and brand new jeans in cooler water to prevent fading. Add a small amount of mild, liquid detergent to the water. Swish the water a bit so the soap is mixed in well. Avoid powdered detergent. It doesn't mix well in water that is cool and standing. Most liquid detergents will work but a mild, color safe detergent will preserve your jeans' color better. In a pinch, you can use baby shampoo, liquid dish detergent, or even white vinegar. Place your jeans in the water and swish them around.

Do this several times, rearranging or flipping them over to get more trapped water out. Never wring your jeans. This damages the fibers and contributes to wear and tear. Drying Your Jeans Air dry your jeans to avoid shrinkage and fading. Stretch jeans out on a drying rack (or another flat surface) or hang them on a line. They will dry faster if they are not folded or hung over an object like a chair or door. Air drying your jeans will preserve the fibers for longer than machine drying. Air drying will also prevent shrinkage and fading. Machine dry your jeans on low heat if you are pinched for time. If you put your jeans in the dryer, make sure to protect them by using a low to medium heat setting. Nothing destroys jean fibers more than high heat electric drying. Machine drying will shrink your denim and, over time, fade the color. If your favorite jeans are prone to stretching out, machine drying will tighten them back up. Spot Cleaning Your Jeans Spot clean your jeans to prevent unnecessary wear and tear. Spot cleaning is a good way to care for your jeans and avoid unnecessary wear and tear from over-washing. If your jeans are mostly clean but you spilled something or got a little mud on them, consider spot cleaning to preserve your jeans and save on water. Use a dab of mild detergent on a cotton swab or washcloth. Put just a little bit of liquid detergent, baby shampoo, or liquid dish detergent on a damp cotton swab or washcloth.
