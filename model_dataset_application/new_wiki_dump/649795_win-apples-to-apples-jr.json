If you take too long to choose, then you may not get a chance to win a point for that hand. Try to decide which card you are going to play as fast as you can and then throw it down right away."

Judges will often choose the silliest card as the winner even if some of the other cards do a better job of matching the meaning of the card. The rules of Apples to Apples Junior are very loose in this way because the game is more about having fun than being competitive."
