Test your soil's pH level using a testing kit, which you can buy online or from a greenhouse. After getting a reading, adjust the soil as necessary. To raise pH, mix limestone into your soil. To lower it, mix in sulfur. You can purchase limestone and sulfur in powder or pellet form at your local garden center. Limestone and sulfur should be mixed in with the top 6 inches (15.2 centimeters) of your soil. The precise amount you use depends on the soil you're treating, so refer to package instructions. Cucumbers and tomatoes thrive best when the soil is neutral (pH 7)."

When choosing a spot for your cocktail garden, go with an area not blocked by shade from tall trees, bushes, or other plants. The amounts of needed sunlight vary, but most herbs, fruits, and vegetables benefit from around 6-8 hours daily. Basil can thrive on slightly less sun than other herbs. If you live in a harsh summer climate, provide your herbs with some afternoon shade to prevent scorching."

Basil seeds should be planted 12 to 24 inches apart (about 30 to 60 centimeters). Rosemary grows in thick hedges, so plant your seeds about 3 feet apart (about 1 meter). Sage grows in bushes, so plant your seeds about 24 to 36 inches apart (about 60 to 91 centimeters). Many types of mint will outgrow their space quickly. Plant mint in a plastic pot in the ground with about 2 inches (5.1 cm) of the rim above the soil or in an above-ground planter to ensure that it won\u2019t take over the garden."

Make sure never to clip an entire rosemary stem away. Clip sage in the morning, just after the dew as dried. Take sage leaves as needed, clipping the leaves at the point where two leaves meet."

When you harvest your plants, you can then use the fruits and vegetables in a variety of cocktails. Watermelons are ripe when they feel hollow when tapped and there is little color contrast between the stripes near the top. Remove watermelon from the branch by cutting it off from the stem with a sharp knife. Harvest cucumbers once they're 4-6 inches (about 10-15 cm) long. You can simply pick cucumbers from the branch to harvest. Tomatoes should remain on the vine as long as possible. Tomatoes come in different colors, so pick yours when they reach a deep shade of the appropriate color. Blueberries are usually ready to pick between July and August. Pick the berries a few days after they turn blue."

Basil tends to do better in soil that is both moist and well-drained. Mint tends to do best in covered soil, so you should cover your soil with a small amount of mulch after planting mint.

If you're planting cucumbers and tomatoes in your cocktail garden, start off from seed by growing them indoors in pots with potting soil 6-8 weeks before the last frost of the season. After a few weeks, you can transport these plants into your garden. Cucumbers require a lot of space, so make sure to plant them between 36 and 60 inches apart (about 91 to 152 centimeters). Start planting other fruits and veggies in the spring. The vast majority of fruits and vegetables should be planted in spring, after frost has passed. This may prevent them from dying as a result of not being established enough to endure cold weather conditions. Provide mulch. Most fruits and vegetables require a layer of mulch kept on the ground nearby. Provide a 2-4 inch (5 to 10 centimeter) layer of materials, like wood chips, straw, or pine needles, to protect your plants. Water your plants properly. Regular watering will help your fruits and vegetables grow to maturation. Make sure to water your fruits and vegetables according to their type to encourage them to thrive.
