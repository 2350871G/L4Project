If you plan on stacking a few rectangular books on a square nightstand, try offsetting them with a circular alarm clock and curvy lamp base. You could place the books at either end of the surface and put the lamp and clock in the center as the focal points."

          "description":"Keep most of the colors on your nightstand within the same family as the bedding. Vary the color tones to keep the arrangement interesting. For example, if the dominant color in your quilt is red, you could choose a maroon lamp or bouquet of pink roses for your nightstand accessories. Color coordination includes contrasting hues, too! If you have a variety of reds on your bed and nightstand, try adding a green alarm clock or picture frame."

          "headline":"Get creative with space.",
          "description":"Think of space as a complementary element to the objects on your nightstand. This will allow you to keep the number of objects to a minimum. Place two or three objects in the center, leaving the surrounding space open. Alternatively, you could put some space in between the objects. Don't limit your notion of space to horizontally. If you don't have much space by your bedside, try going vertical by using a bookshelf as a nightstand. You could place your alarm clock and reading material on the shelf closest to the bed. Just make sure it's not taller than your headboard or things could look unbalanced."

          "headline":"Decorate the surrounding wall space.",
          "description":"Include the wall space above your nightstand in your accessorizing. Hang a painting or print at a point that's neither too high nor too low. If you have a small bedroom, install a mirror to create the illusion of added space. If you use your phone as an alarm clock, hang an analogue or digital wall clock in this space. Hanging 2 matching mirrors \u2014 1 on each side of your bed \u2014 can brighten the space and make it look more sophisticated."

A wall sconce will free up space for your alarm clock, reading glasses, book, watch, and other objects. It will also allow you to add some decorative accessories around the things you need within reach when you wake up or turn in for the night. If you're not up for hardwiring a wall sconce, look for one that just attaches to the wall and plugs in. They're usually cheaper, and you'll be able to easily switch it out when you redecorate."

Aim for a shorter lamp whose light hits the bottom two-thirds of the painting. On the other hand, if you have a tall sculpture or flower vase that you'd rather not move, you should opt for a tall lamp for a balanced sense of height."

You could get really creative and use books as the base of the nightstand. Secure the stack and place a sheet of glass or wooden board on top as the table surface. For a minimalist look, turn the books so the spines are facing in toward the wall and the pages are facing out."

For example, if your bedroom is dominated by antiques and subdued colors, a bright or abstract sculpture might clash.

They will also bring the outdoors into the home, adding a natural accent to the d\u00e9cor. Choose colors that will either complement or fall in line with the bedding and other nightstand accessories. Keep the flowers or shells in a beautiful vase or bowl.
