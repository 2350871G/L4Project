      "description":"Put up your decorations before the day of the party to make sure everything gets done. Get your child to help you come up with a theme for the party. Themes include but are not limited to:\nColour themes (e.g. all pink, shades of pink, or neon, etc.) Disney Princess themes\nStar Wars theme\nAction figures theme\nRace car theme\nAfter you chose a theme, you must buy the actual decorations, which can include:\nBalloons (round, helium, worm-shape, or water)\nString decorations\nA birthday sign\nA pi\u00f1ata (candy-filled or other wrapped-treats)\nChain decorations*\nPom-pom decorations\nSticker decorations\nPoster decorations\nOrigami decorations (hanging from thread)\nCut-out decorations (e.g. you can cut out large paper images and glue them)\nChain decorations are made of paper by cutting out rectangular strips of paper and taping them loop by loop. They are a great space-filler, and they are also fun to make. They are home-made and you can choose your own colours, according to your theme. Most of these decorations can be purchased at dollar-stores, and are usually at a favourable price. Try to include home-made decorations, they aren\u2019t any less special! Remember to buy enough decorations for the amount of space you are using. Then, put them up. If you are using multiple rooms for the party, set them up equally, but put up more decorations in the main-room."

      "headline":"Pick different activities.",
      "description":"Sit down with your child and discuss what they would like to do during the party. Ask them about:\nMovies-(make sure they choose age-appropriate movies. Movies also usually run for more than an hour, so choose a movie that fits your time schedule). Games \u2013 this can include board games like Bingo (or other games you own/can purchase), or if the weather is suitable, outdoor games like basketball, octopus, tag, dodge-ball etc. Crafts- e.g. : painting nails, face-painting, frame-making (you can use popsicles, or buy cheap craft frames to decorate), cookie-decorating. Try to stay away from \u201cdrawing competitions\u201d, because not everyone enjoys drawing and it can make others feel excluded. Do not introduce too many competitions (e.g. singing competitions). In between games/crafts, they can also have snack intervals to just talk, eat and relax. Offer them drinks and small snacks to keep them fuelled up. Before making any final decisions about games/movies/crafts consult with your child. Ask them if they are comfortable with these choices, and if they think their friends will enjoy it."

      "headline":"Purchase or buy snacks.",

It is your choice whether you want to get cake at the party, or some other dessert. Snacks can include:\nCrackers\nChips and Dip\nCupcakes\nRice Krispies\nPretzels\nJello\nPudding\nTake into account any allergies the guests may have. To be safe, get peanut-free snacks."

      "description":"Loot bags are a way of saying \u201cthank you\u201d for coming to the party. They are fun to receive, but must be fair and creative. First, start by gathering what to put in the loot bags. Most dollar stores have very cute and creative party sections where you can find objects to put in the loot bags. They may include:\nKey chains (e.g. flip-flop key-chains)\nStickers\nFun rings\nCute magnets\nDecorative pencils/erasers\nBright note-books\nSmall race-cars\nDecorative beads\nParty hats\nMini puzzle games\nA small plushie\n(GIRLS) You can also choose to get them other gifts such as :\nCreams (e.g. Bath and Body works)\nbracelets/necklaces\nLeg Warmers\nMini-purses\nOther accessories (e.g. Ardene and Claire\u2019s)\nHair clips\n\n(BOYS) Some ideas for boy loot-bags:\nSmall air-craft toys\nSmall toy race-cars\nSmall robot toys\n\n\nYou could also choose to put a variety of candy in their loot-bags like:\nCandy canes\nChocolate coins\nKinder surprise eggs\nMarshmallow Candy\nMake sure every guest gets an equal amount of gifts in their loot-bag so nobody feels excluded. Then, put the gifts in individual bags."
