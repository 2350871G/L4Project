If you prefer, before packing up your meat, you can infuse it with flavor by mixing seasonings or a marinade. For example, pack up a piece of salmon with salt, pepper, dill, and a slice of lemon."

Fold the edges of the bag's opening over so your food doesn't make a mess as you place it into the bag. Make sure there's one to two inches (three to five centimeters) between the food item and side of the bag that you're sealing. That way, you'll have room to lock the sealer's lid over the bag's opening. Some vacuum seal bags have a maximum fill line, so check your product for a line near its opening."
