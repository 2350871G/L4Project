Preparing the Doll Remove your doll\u2019s clothing and hair accessories. Detangle the hair as much as possible. Keep the clothing away from water, as moisture can permanently damage the fabric. Take the clothing and hair accessories and put them in a safe place, away from the washing site. Cover the doll\u2019s eyes with masking tape to prevent rusting.
