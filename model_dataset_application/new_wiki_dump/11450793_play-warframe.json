      "headline":"Login & play through the tutorial.",
      "description":"Once the game\u2019s open, you\u2019ll be met with a login screen. Enter the username and password you made for yourself earlier. After a short loading screen, the opening cutscene will play. At some point, you\u2019ll be asked to choose your Warframe. Warframes are the playable characters of the game; they all do different things and have their own strengths, weaknesses and specializations. You\u2019re given the choice of three different frames to start your adventure;\nExcalibur is a balanced Warframe focused on melee attacks. As the game describes, he is a good choice for new players, but don\u2019t feel like you have to choose him if one of the other two looks more appealing. All three of these frames are viable choices. Mag is a caster who has control over magnetism. A slightly more complex Warframe for those who want to fight with both weapons and magnetic-themes abilities. Her abilities provide good utility. Volt is the fastest and most versatile Warframe of the three, using electricity to augment his attacks. His abilities can be used to disrupt enemies, protect allies and speed up both his movement and melee attacks. After you\u2019ve chosen your warframe, you\u2019ll watch another cutscene, after which you\u2019ll start the game\u2019s tutorial. Here, you\u2019ll learn how to move, attack and cast abilities. As this is a computer game, you\u2019ll play using a mouse and keyboard. Use the W, A, S and D keys to move. Space to jump, CTRL to crouch and slide, shift to roll and sprint. Warframe has a unique parkour system, which allows you to perform actions like wall running and wall jumping. Use your mouse to look around. Left-click to shoot your current weapon, right-click to aim. Press E on your keyboard to use your melee attack. Press F to switch between your primary and secondary weapons. All warframes have 4 abilities, which are bound to the 1, 2, 3 and 4 keys. Using abilities costs energy, shown by a bar on the bottom right. Energy can be replenished using blue energy orbs, which are dropped by fallen enemies. While playing through the tutorial, you\u2019ll get to choose your starting primary, secondary and melee weapons. More weapons will be obtainable later in the game. Progress through the rest of the tutorial, which will teach you about some more mechanics like timed defense and the hacking minigame."

      "headline":"Explore your orbiter.",
      "description":"At the end of the first mission, you'll obtain a ship called an \"orbiter\" that will serve as the main hub of the game. This is where you'll spend most of your time outside of missions. Your orbiter is where you\u2019ll set your loadout, manage your inventory, build new gear and initiate missions. You can start a mission by interacting with the navigation console at the front of your orbiter. Doing this will bring up the star chart, a map of the various planets and mission nodes. You start on Earth, but will be able to branch out to other planets as you progress through the game. There are different mission types which have different objectives. Within missions, you\u2019ll gather resources used to craft new gear and rank up your equipped gear, making it stronger. Warframes and weapons start at rank 0 and can be ranked up to rank 30. Higher rank means stronger gear and more upgrade slots. The market is where you can buy blueprints for new frames and weapons. You can also buy fully built frames and weapons using Platinum, the game\u2019s premium currency. #* You can acquire Platinum by spending real money, or by trading with other players. Since you can get Platinum by trading, you can obtain almost every item in the game for free, except for some cosmetics which can only be bought with money. The mod terminal can be used to manage your mods. Mods are upgrades you can install on gear to further increase their efficiency. Modding is one of the most important aspects of Warframe, as it allows you to complete higher leveled content. The foundry is where you craft gear and items. Buying/discovering blueprints, gathering resources and building things in the foundry is how most frames and weapons are obtained. The codex contains valuable information about the game. Later on, you\u2019ll be able to research enemies and locations to add more codex pages, or you can just read guides and the game\u2019s wiki online. At first, most of these features will be unavailable. You'll unlock them and learn exactly how they work while completing the game's first quest, Vor's Prize."

You can find blueprints in the market, as loot drops in missions, and on junctions; special missions used to unlock a new planet. As you progress, you\u2019ll increase your account\u2019s Mastery Rank, which will give you access to more advanced gear. Ranking up gear and completing missions for the first time award mastery rank points; once you\u2019ve gotten enough points for your current rank, you\u2019ll be allowed to complete a small test of your knowledge and ability.
