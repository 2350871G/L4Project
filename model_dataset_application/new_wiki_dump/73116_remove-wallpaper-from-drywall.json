          "description":"The type of wallpaper that\u2019s on the walls will determine how much effort you have to put into removing it. Newer wallpaper is called strippable wallpaper, because you can strip it off with your hands and a scraper without adding water or stripping chemicals. No matter what kind of wallpaper you have, begin by tearing off all the loose pieces you can. If you have strippable wallpaper, you'll be able to remove all the wallpaper without chemical strippers. Continue stripping and dry scraping the paper to remove the majority of it. Loosen the corners with a putty knife or scraper, and then peel off the paper at a 15-degree angle. Use a damp sponge to moisten any leftover paper, and use a scraper to remove the rest of it. If you have peelable wallpaper, you'll be able to remove the top layer of paper easily, and the backing will stay behind on the wall. You'll remove this backing later with water and chemical stripper.

Don\u2019t press too hard, because the scorer can damage the drywall underneath. It\u2019s important to score the wallpaper or the backing because this will give the chemical stripper access to the paste underneath. Once the paste is soaked with the stripper, the wallpaper will come off easily. Use course sandpaper to rough up the surface of the wallpaper or backing if you don\u2019t have a scoring tool."

          "description":"Fill a bucket with hot water and soak the wallpaper removing sheets to saturate them. This will allow them to stick to the walls, and will start to loosen the glue under the paper or the backing. If you're using a powdered chemical stripper that gets mixed with water, you can also soak the sheets in the chemical stripping solution instead of plain water. Wallpaper strippers can come as a premixed liquid, a liquid concentrate, or a powder. If you have a powder or liquid concentrate, place the stripping chemical in a bucket and mix it with water according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. When working with harsh chemicals, consider wearing gloves and protective eyewear. Always work in a well-ventilated room."

Place the sheets on the wall vertically, starting at one of the corners. Don\u2019t overlap the sheets, but make sure the edges are touching to ensure there are no areas of exposed paper between them. It\u2019s important to use the wallpaper removing sheets when using chemical strippers to remove wallpaper from drywall, because the sheets will protect the drywall from excess moisture and water damage. You'll probably only have enough sheets to cover a portion of the wall, so you'll have to work in sections until all the wallpaper has been removed."

For both ready-made and unmixed solutions, you can either use a spray bottle to soak the sheets, or transfer the mixture to a compression sprayer for faster application. Leave the sheets to soak on the walls for about 30 minutes. While you normally wouldn\u2019t want to let drywall soak for more than 15, the sheets will stop it from getting too wet. As the wallpaper soaks, the chemical solution will soak in through the holes you poked in the paper or backing and dissolve the glue underneath."

When you remove a sheet from the wall, separate the sheet from the wallpaper and discard the wallpaper. Place the sheet back into the solution to soak again so that you can reuse it on a new section of wallpaper.
