For two pounds (900 grams) of brussels sprouts, mix half a cup (4 fluid ounces) of balsamic vinegar with two tablespoons of brown sugar. Increase or decrease the amounts depending on the amount of brussels sprouts you're cooking. For example, if you're only cooking a pound of brussels sprouts, use a quarter cup of balsamic vinegar and one tablespoon of brown sugar."
