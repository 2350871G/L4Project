Instead of putting effort into battling your urge, find something else to do instead. Being active will help your brain move on. Try taking a walk, or if you\u2019re at work and can\u2019t leave the building, even walking up and down stairs can reset your thinking. Talk to friends. Start texting or messaging someone online.
