          "description":"One of the most common problems for new Gears players is that they aim by staring at the end of the gun. While natural, this is actually not the most accurate way to plan your shots. When you're not holding the Left trigger to aim specifically, your shots will come from the dead center of your screen. The best way to prepare is to look slightly over your characters right shoulder, which is always in the center of the screen. This is most important when using the Gnasher (shotgun) as shooting without aiming is a viable way to take down nearby enemies. In Gears 1&2 the aim is lined up with the animation of the gun on screen. However, the center of the screen is still the best place to look for aiming consistency."

          "headline":"Get comfortable with the \"cover radius\" of certain objects.",
          "description":"Gears of War is much more about effective movement than most other shooters, as the 3rd person perspective allows rolls, runs, quick turns, and speedy strafing. Your most-used button is your \"A\" button, and it allows you to hide, sprint, and roll. Press it near cover and you will be quickly \"sucked\" behind it, hiding you on walls, pillars, and sandbags. Spend some time getting used to this vital function:\nWhat is the furthest distance from something you can press A to get into cover? Note how much faster your movement is when you move to cover -- this is an important tool to avoid enemies and get the upper hand. Open up a private match and just run the course, finding all the weapons. This is the best way to practice movement effectively."

          "headline":"Use the Roadie Run instead of trying to roll everywhere.",
          "description":"Rolling (by double tapping A) is a bit slower than just holding A and running. Your movement is also easier to control when holding A, which begins your \"Roadie Run.\" Save rolls for quick movements in a fight, or to quickly move laterally when a wall approaches, then resume running by holding A. New players often try and move by rolling everywhere. Don't-- it is slower than just running."

          "description":"Once you're in cover and you character is pressed against a wall, you have a couple of options for your next move. Understanding these, and using them to your advantage, is vital to success:\n\nPress A and forward to jump over the barrier and/or sprint to the next nearby cover. This is a risky move, as it is a set 1-second animation that you cannot move during. Good players will notice and take free shots. Press the right trigger to blind fire. Without exposing your character, this fires your gun around or above the cover. Only useful with a shotgun, when an unsuspecting player is about to cross your cover. Hold left trigger to pop out and shoot. Left trigger lets you pop out, aiming your gun and shooting while staying partially in cover. Once you left go of left trigger you'll automatically slide back into cover to reload or gain health. Pull back on the stick to leave cover in place. Simply pull back on the control stick and you'll peel off cover without a big dramatic movement, letting you resume the fight in place. This is the most effective way to leave cover. Roll out with a double-tapped A. This is good for a burst of movement in any direction. Simply point the way you want to move and hit A twice in rapid succession."

        {
          "headline":"Learn to \"Wallbounce\" to gain the edge in firefights.",
          "description":"Wallbouncing  uses the temporary burst of speed gained when entering cover to slip and slide around enemies in a close-range fight. To do it, you need to get good at entering and leaving cover rapidly-- pressing A, hitting the wall, then immediately pulling off or rolling away. You then use A again to enter new cover, effectively bouncing back and forth between covers in a split-second. Practice bouncing down the same wall. Come in, then leave cover. Aim your character diagonally, farther down the wall, and press A to rapidly \"bounce\" up the whole wall without having to run. Learning to aim while wallbouncing  will make you invincible. Attach your shotgun and work on getting in close quickly, and squeezing off 1-2 shots, never stopping your feet the whole time."

          "description":"Gears of War has a great feature called \"Active Reload,\" where you can speed up a reload with proper timing. When you hit reload (usually right bumper), a small bar appears in the upper right corner. As the little marker moves to the right on the bar, it will cross an all white, highlighted area of the reload bar. If you click reload again as it does your gun will reload instantly, and make your bullets a little more effective. To make the most of it, you need to be able to reload the gun in the midst of any activity. Work on nailing your active reload while still moving and dodging for the best results."

          "description":"Every player in Gears starts out with the same weapons, putting you on an even playing field with everyone else around. These weapons, unlike the weapons you begin with in most shooters, are powerful and should be enough to contest almost any battle:\n\nLancer: Your standard assault rifle, it is used for mid-range fights and support fire. Gnasher: The most commonly used weapon in the game, your shotgun is for up close and personal fights. Pistol: Surprisingly powerful and accurate at mid and longer distances, the pistol is great to finish enemies while reloading or supporting far off teammates. It can get a head shot instant kill if it hits the enemies skull when they are at low health. Smoke Grenades: In Gears 2, 3, and 4 this temporarily stuns enemies while providing a smoke screen. In later versions it only produces the smoke screen."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Learn to wield your shotgun with speed and precision.",
          "description":"Hands down, the most important weapon in Gears of War is the Gnasher shotgun. In tight quarters, the player with the best shotgun skills will always get the kill, and the extreme power of the gun in close-range means good players only need 1-2 shots to get the job done. Some tips for the shotgun include:\nIn very close combat, where you are rolling and moving right next to the enemy, don't worry about aiming with the left trigger. Once they hit the center of your screen, fire. When in cover, use the left trigger to aim and then shoot simultaneously. You're a sitting duck in aiming mode, but your accuracy is much better. Aim as best you can before hitting Left trigger, then pull the left and right triggers simultaneously, shooting and returning to cover quickly. Keep moving between shots. You'll have a half-second after a shot while you re-cock the weapon. Use it to roll or wall bounce away, setting up the next shot."

        {
          "headline":"Hold enemies at bay and support teammates with the Lancer.",
          "description":"The Lancer is very situation. At a medium distance, it is deadly against an enemy in the open, slowing them down and dealing enough damage to down them after 2-3 seconds of constant fire. However, if your enemy has cover, or you're in close quarters, you'll likely fail to connect enough shots. Use the Lancer when you've got some space:\nPin down enemies from afar. While your Lancer may not kill someone in cover, it can be enough to keep them from poking their head out. Use this to protect objectives, teammates, or power weapons. If you see a teammate in a shotgun battle, use your Lancer to assist. It will slow down the enemy and may deal enough damage to make a half-hit shotgun blast effective."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use the Longshot's accuracy and incredible power to score quick kills.",
          "description":"The Longshot is one of the hardest weapons to use, but one of the most effective. This sniper rifle only has one shot before needing to reload, so you need to make it count. Luckily, one shot to the head will kill any player immediately, and only three shots to the body are needed to take someone down. When using the Longshot, set up in cover in an area where you have high visibility. High places are often best since you can look down on the whole map. Use the longshot on distracted enemies -- those fighting teammates, in cover, or picking up other weapons, to shoot on the moment they freeze to help someone or pick up a weapon."

          "headline":"Master the Torque Bow for huge damage and 1-shot kills.",
          "description":"The Torque Bow is a crossbow that shoots grenades. You have to hold down the right trigger to pull the string back, then you release to shoot. If you hit a player with a tense bow the grenade arrow will stick to them, then blow up for an instant kill. But you can also shoot the ground or bounce the shot off of walls to deal massive grenade damage to multiple enemies. You have a laser sight that tells you where the shot will go depending on how hard you're pulling back the bow. Shooting before you reach full tension can help you drop a grenade at a group's feet instead of trying to \"stick\" someone. If you hold the bow back long enough it will eventually shoot, so don't try and save a shot for the right time -- you'll waste precious ammo."
        },

          "headline":"Aim for the feet with the Boomshot.",
          "description":"The grenade launcher can down any nearby enemies if it hits someone's feet, dealing a wide swath of massive damage. If you shoot someone directly with it they will die in one hit, but there is such limited ammo this can be risky. A shot to the feet is the most sure-fire way to get any nearby enemies down. Boomshots have slow, arcing bullets, so be sure to lead your opponents slightly."

          "headline":"Rain death from above with the Hammer of Dawn.",
          "description":"This godly weapon takes some time to warm up but is deadly when it does. If the opponents are outside, a laser will come down on the spot you're aiming and instantly kill anything it touches. Once you've warmed it up, you can drag this laser around, instantly killing whole groups or enemies. Make sure there are no roofs or nearby buildings protecting your target. They will hear a small noise alerting them that you're targeting them as you warm up the Hammer and escape it's wrath. Aim at walls and the floor, not at the player. You need to hold the trigger down on  a non-moving target to activate the weapon. Stay back and use cover and height to accurately aim. The Hammer is great to clear out key spots (like bases or the flag) as well as protect other weapons."

This is the best mode for beginners since you don't have to sit and watch if you die and you get plenty of action in."

In the tight, chaotic games of Gears this knowledge is indispensable.

That can turn your death into the death of your whole team quickly if the opponent is well organized. While some risk is always necessary, you need to do everything to stay alive when possible. Never run out into the open unless you've got someone covering with smoke grenades, Lancers, or both. When moving in for a shotgun battle, ensure you have the element of surprise, better numbers, or both. If you see that the other team has a power weapon, try and avoid them unless you've got a clear chance for the kill. Let them waste their ammo and put the fight back on an even playing field."
