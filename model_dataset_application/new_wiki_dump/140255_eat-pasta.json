The difference between the two is obviously freshness, but for ease of use the dried pasta is often readily available in the pantry, while fresh pasta needs to be purchased as it's needed or made from scratch (the latter being a time-consuming but enjoyable kitchen exercise). Or, you can use layers of pasta between sauces and filling to make lasagna and cylinders of pasta to make cannelloni. Most dried pasta is made in a factory. It is quality controlled and comes in a wide variety of shapes. Fresh pasta can be purchased from specialty stores, from supermarkets or made at home. If eating pasta at a restaurant of good quality, it is preferable that the pasta be made fresh. The dough is usually made from hard durum wheat; this produces an elastic quality in the dough that makes it easy to stretch into shapes."
