These will be perfect for stashing small items that are prone to getting dropped or misplaced, such as paper clips, thumbtacks, and staples. Shot glasses, mason jars, or coffee mugs could also double as easy desktop storage if cheap paper cups aren\u2019t your thing. If you\u2019re worried about losing or mixing up your most-used supplies, group your containers inside a separate tray to ensure that they all stay together."

          "description":"Slice a thick tree branch or small stump into a disc that\u2019s roughly 6 inches (15 cm) across and 3\u20134 inches (7.6\u201310.2 cm) high. Drill a series of holes into the upper surface of the wood using a \u20442 in (13 mm) drill bit, then slip your writing utensils inside to reduce the clutter inside your desk drawers. Unlike store-bought pen and pencil holders, a quaint wooden organizer can introduce a charming natural element to your workspace. Cutting the wood will require you to use a hand saw, circular saw, or similar tool. Always take the necessary safety precautions when operating cutting tools to prevent an accident or injury."

Once you\u2019ve decided on the best way to configure your shelves, use a few lines of wood glue to fasten them into a single unit. The possibilities are virtually endless! Another option is to ask around at supermarkets for the kind of disposable crates that produce and other fragile goods are often shipped in.Tip: You can often find inexpensive wooden crates at craft stores and shops that specialize in home dec\u00f3r."

Turn the cans onto their sides and glue them to a custom-cut scrap wood base, making sure the openings all face the same directions. You can even glue one or more additional layers of cans on top to make multi-tiered cubbies. You might also try this with paint cans if you need to maximize your storage space. If you like, you can spray paint the cans to add a touch of color. Metallic shades will look particularly good on the sleek, round cubbies."

You can stick to a single color, go two-tone, or even incorporate simple designs like hearts, diamonds, or your favorite superhero\u2019s trademark logo. Cover drab metal caddies with 1-2 coats of enamel spray paint before you begin embroidering. The addition of a little yarn can give cold, impersonal accessories a more homely feel."

Once the paint has had time to dry, stand 2 of the squares up vertically and space the remaining 3-4 squares evenly between them horizontally. Drive drywall screws through the edges of the horizontal squares to hold them in place. A standard 2-slot tray will call for a total of five 10 in (25 cm) squares.

You can pick up a single compression spring from any hardware store or home improvement center for as little as $5.Tip: For a more aesthetic approach, use a board with a live edge or a piece of raw wood that\u2019s been planed flat."
