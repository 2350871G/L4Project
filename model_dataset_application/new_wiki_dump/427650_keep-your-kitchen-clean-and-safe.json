That way, messes don't pile up, and you have a clean kitchen to work with at the start of your next meal. After each meal:\nClear the table\nTransfer leftovers to airtight containers and store them in the refrigerator or freezer\nWash, dry, and put away all the dishes\nRun the dishwasher when it's full\nClean spills, crumbs, and messes from the stove, floors, table, and counters\nWash out the sink"

For food spills, use a spoon or cloth to clean up solid waste. Clean up excess liquids or sauces with a cloth. Spray the area with an all-purpose cleaner and wipe it dry. When spills involve raw meat, use a disinfecting spray to clean the mess to prevent the spread of bacteria. Cleaning liquid spills from the floor is also important for safety, because a wet floor is a slipping hazard."
