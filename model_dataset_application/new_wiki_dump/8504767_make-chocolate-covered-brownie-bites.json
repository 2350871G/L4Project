Watch the pot closely to make sure nothing burns. It's a good idea to remove the butter while it's still somewhat solid. Butter can burn easily. If the chocolate is melted and there is still a small chunk of butter that is solid, remove the pan from the heat. Mix everything together until the butter melts as well. After melting, allow your butter and chocolate mixture to cool off until it reaches room temperature. This should take about 15 minutes."
