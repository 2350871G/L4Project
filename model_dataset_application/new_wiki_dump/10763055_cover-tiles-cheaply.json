Try to get as close as possible to the correct dimensions for the room to ensure that the tile is mostly covered. If you\u2019re having trouble finding inexpensive rugs, shop at thrift stores, or purchase a variety of smaller rugs to layer them and cover the floor. Remember to place a sticky mat under the rugs since the fabric can sometimes slide over the tiles. You can find inexpensive sticky mats at most home improvement stores and supermarkets!"

          "description":"Purchase a large sheet of vinyl decals to add character to tile flooring or a backsplash. Make sure you measure the area that you want to cover and be sure to buy enough decals to completely cover the area. When you\u2019re ready to apply the decals, simply trim them to size, peel the backing off, stick them to the tiles, and smooth them with a credit card to remove air bubbles. This is a great way to add a pattern to plain tiling without painting, and it\u2019s easily removable when you want to change it up. All you have to do is peel off the decals to start over. Some decals have more \"traditional\" tile patterns, like mosaics or Tuscan tiles, while others are simple solid colors. If you like the original color of the tiles and want to give them a quick update, you can add decals that let the color of the tiles show through."

Keep in mind that most carpet tiles cost about $1 for 1 foot (0.30 m) squared, so you can plan your budget accordingly. When you\u2019re ready, peel off the backing and stick them to the tile. If you want to remove the carpet tiles or reposition them, simply pull them up by the corners to reveal the tile underneath."

As you\u2019re covering the tile, cut the sheets to be as long as possible, peel off the backing, and overlap the contact paper along the seams to prevent peeling. Smooth the paper with a credit card to remove air bubbles to finish off the project! Contact paper comes in a variety of different patterns and finishes that are perfect for countertops, including wood grain, glossy marble, and granite. To remove the paper, begin pulling it from the corner of the sheet and work slowly across the countertop.Tip: Make sure the pattern on the contact paper lines up and is oriented in the same direction for a more professional, high-end look."

Apply the paint in 2 even coats, and add a layer of sealant over the painted tiles, especially if they might be exposed to foot traffic or water. There are a variety of different paint options for tile, including chalkboard, latex, and oil-based. Opt for chalkboard paint if you want to save money since you don\u2019t need to apply a primer.

Then, simply mix and pour self-leveling concrete over the countertops and follow the package instructions to cure it. Paint a sealant over the concrete to protect it from water and debris. While this is a more labor-intensive option, it can be very inexpensive, depending on the type of concrete you choose. Keep in mind that the concrete will likely crack slightly during the curing process, but you can fill in the cracks with the sealant."
