          "description":"Take the lucky bamboo from its container and remove any wire that\u2019s holding the stalks together. Gently comb through the roots with your fingers to separate them, and then separate all the stalks. Pour the water from the container into a colander to drain the water and catch the pebbles. Lucky bamboo often comes with wire holding the stalks together, but the wire can damage the plant, so it\u2019s best to remove it."

          "description":"The parent stalk should have at least 2 nodes, which are the lines separating the lucky bamboo stalk into segments. Once you\u2019ve identified the healthy, long stalks, look for a good offshoot. The offshoot should be 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) long, and should be dark green and growing from 1 of the upper nodes. Nodes are the areas on a plant from which leaves grow."

Then, use the shears or knife to trim off an additional \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) from the bottom to make a straight cut."

Removing the bottom leaves will redirect the plant\u2019s energy to producing roots. It\u2019s also important to remove the leaves so they don\u2019t rot when you place the offshoot in water to root."

The cutting shouldn\u2019t be completely submerged. If you have more than 1 cutting, you can put them all in the same jar. It\u2019s important to use distilled or bottled water, because these don\u2019t contain chlorine, which will damage the bamboo. If you want to use tap water, pour the water into the jar and let it sit for 24 hours to let the chlorine break down before putting in the cutting."

Place the bamboo in bright, indirect light. Bamboo needs lots of bright light to thrive, but it will burn quickly in direct sun. Find a bright location for the bamboo, such as a partially shaded windowsill, where it will get lots of light every day. Caring for the Parent Stalk Trim off the top above the next node. Take the stalk from which you took the cutting and place it on a cutting board. Locate the node from which you cut the offshoot, and then find the next node down. Measure \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) above that node, and then use a sharp knife or shears to trim off the top of the lucky bamboo stalk.
