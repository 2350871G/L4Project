Traditionally gendered colors, like pinks and blues, can both be present as undertones in a nautical nursery. When deciding on your color scheme, you can disregard your baby's gender as a defining factor. Since neutrals are the base of this theme, the colors will be simple to design around."

          "description":"The ocean is comprised mainly of gray and blue shades. Therefore, rely on this for your main color scheme. Carpets, walls, and furniture should be in varying shades of grays and blues. There is no need to use one shade. You can mix and match a variety of grays, blues, and whites. In fact, you should try to balance darker blues and grays with brighter whites, as well as more vibrant blues and lighter grays. This keeps the room from looking too dreary. If you feel blue is too gendered of a color, you can stick to varying shades of gray or use a more grayish blue to downplay the gender factor."

          "headline":"Add other ocean colors for accents.",
          "description":"There are many other colors found in the ocean. Hints of shades caused by the reflection of the sun can give your nautical nursery some added flavor. Try throwing in splashes purples, pinks, and greens throughout your nursery. For example, you could have a dresser with sea-green knobs or a changing table with pink polka dots. Decorations can also follow the color scheme. When selecting things like mobiles and stuffed animals, go for ocean-based colors. These are also good places to bring in some yellows and tans as a play on the sun and the sand. These can brighten up a room and make it more cheery for your child."

You can paint things like whales, starfish, coral reefs, ships, sailors, and other nautical images. If you're adept at arts, you can paint murals yourself. If you're not into painting, you can hire a painter or have an artistic friend help you. Stick to your color scheme when adding murals. Use colors like grays, blues, greens, purples, and pinks to reflect the nautical theme. For a simple wall that you can do yourself, consider doing an ombre wall transitioning from a darker blue to a white, or paint blue and white stripes on your accent wall."

You can do something like paint sand near the floor and fish floating around the sailboat. This can create a sunken ship effect.

White, light gray, and light tan or sandy-colored dressers, cabinets, and shelves can help keep your room balanced and keep you from overdoing your accent colors. Try to get non-themed pieces in a light wood or white color scheme. Keep things like rocking chairs and rugs neutral, and use the decor and accents to bring in your blues and dark grays. If you don't mind painting a piece of furniture, consider painting a dresser or nightstand navy blue. To add some fun to certain pieces, you can always embellish them with nautical accents or stencils. For example, line a mantel with nautical-themed toys. You can also glue seashells onto a toy chest, or paint it to look like an aquarium or treasure chest."

If you don't want a single lamp or if you want to add additional lighting, try stringing lights around the room that have sailboats or fish on them. You can easily find these online. If you are fully committed to the nautical theme, you can even look for an overhead light fixture to match your nautical theme, such as a chandelier made with ship line."
