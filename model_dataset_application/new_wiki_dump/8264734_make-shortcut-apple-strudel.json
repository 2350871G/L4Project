Core the apples and carefully slice them as thin as you can (about 1/4\" thick). Place the apples in a mixing bowl. The puff pastry should still be cold when you work with it, so avoid thawing it to room temperature."

Use a large spoon to toss the ingredients together until they're combined. Ensure that all of the apple slices are completely covered with the flour, sugar, and cinnamon. This will help the apples cook evenly as they release juice."

For a shortcut strudel that's great to serve during fall, replace the apples with Bosc pears and use dried cranberries."

Unfold the thawed sheet of puff pastry on the space and use a rolling pin to roll the puff pastry into a rectangle. The rectangle should measure 12x16 inches (30.5x40.5 cm). Turn the pastry frequently while you're rolling it out. This will keep it from sticking to your work surface."

Leave a 1-inch edge at the bottom. Use both of your hands to pick up that edge and fold it over the filling. Roll the pastry with filling onto itself like you're rolling a jelly roll. Set the strudel on a baking sheet and tuck the ends under the strudel. The seam where you folded the pastry should be on the bottom of the strudel. This will keep any filling from leaking out as it bakes on the sheet."

Dip a pastry brush in the egg wash and brush it over the strudel. Use a knife to carefully cut 4 slits in the top of the strudel. Bake the strudel for 35 minutes. It should be golden brown and the filling will bubble when it's cooked. Let the strudel cool for 20 minutes before you serve it. You can dust it with 1 tablespoon of powdered sugar when it's cool or drizzle it with glaze while it's still hot."
