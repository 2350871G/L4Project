To keep your seeds alive, the ground temperature will need to be at least 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) when you plant. If you have a frost after planting, don\u2019t worry as most seedlings will survive this, even if they have to restart from the roots. If you want more flexible planting options, lentils can also be planted indoors as long as the room temperature is kept around 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius). In colder seasons, some people use indoor garden lighting to maintain a consistent temperature."

          "description":"Lentils grow well in both open gardens and containers. The key is to provide the plant with plenty of full sunlight. It helps to plant them alongside low lying plants so that the lentils are not overshadowed. Make sure that the soil stays moist without accumulating standing water on the top, as that can rot out the roots. If you choose to plant your lentils in a container, choose one that is at least 8 inches (20 cm) deep to allow for full root maturity. If you are concerned about the acidity or alkalinity of your soil, get a quick pH test from the garden store. Lentils grow well in the pH range of 6.0 to 6.5."
