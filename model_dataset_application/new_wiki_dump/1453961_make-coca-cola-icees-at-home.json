To create the icee in the bottle, open the cap a little to release some of the pressure and then quickly close it again. Quickly flip the bottle upside down and back up again. It will instantly become a frozen slushie. You can then squeeze the icee out into a cup or a bowl and serve. To make the icee a bit smoother, add a little refrigerated soda to the cup or bowl. To use a frozen bowl to make your slushie, you need a bowl that has been in the freezer. A metal or stainless steel bowl will work best. Pour your soda into the bowl and it will instantly turn from liquid soda to slushie! Your friends will be amazed! Serve with a spoon and straw."
