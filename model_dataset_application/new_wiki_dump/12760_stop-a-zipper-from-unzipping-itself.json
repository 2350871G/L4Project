          "description":"To fix your loose zipper, you can use a small metal key ring, about the size of a penny. Look for a key ring that is thin and durable. You can also use a small rubber band if you are looking for a flexible option. A rubber band can be good if your zipper tends to unzip itself and get stuck mid way on the zipper. The band can stretch enough to allow you to attach the zipper slider to the top button of your pants."

If you are using a rubber band, you can put the rubber band through the hole in the zipper slider and then loop the top part of the band through the section on the zipper slider to form a knot.

If you are trying to fix another garment with a zipper besides a pair of pants, loop the key ring or rubber band over the top button on the garment, such as the top button on a dress or a skirt. Keep in mind this method looks better on dresses or skirts that have hidden zippers, as the key ring or rubber band will show if the zipper is exposed."
