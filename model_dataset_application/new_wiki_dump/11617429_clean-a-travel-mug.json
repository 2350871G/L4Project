Then, plug the sink to fill it up, or fill up a large bowl. As the sink or bowl is filling up, add a squirt of dish soap, about 1 tablespoon (15 mL). Dish soap is gentle on travel mug materials and won\u2019t deteriorate the rubber seal. Avoid using any chlorine-based cleaning products, as these can start to break down the rubber seal."

Then, scrub all over the mug, lid, and rubber seal, making sure that you spend a bit of extra time scrubbing the crevices of the lid.

Replacing the lid before the mug is dry can trap moisture inside, which will allow bacteria to grow. If you want to use your mug right after cleaning it, you can dry it with a clean paper towel or microfiber cloth. Repeat this process after every use if possible, or at least every other use."

When washing it in the dishwasher, remove the lid and place both the lid and mug on the top rack of the dishwasher before adding detergent and running the cycle. Many travel mugs have a rubber seal made of polypropylene, which has a high tolerance for heat. Therefore, these can generally withstand the heat of the dishwasher. To be on the safe side, however, it\u2019s best to place it on the top rack since the top gets less hot than the bottom. Even if your travel mug is dishwasher safe, the high heat will likely start to deteriorate the rubber seal over time. Therefore, only run your travel mug through the dishwasher about once per week, and stop putting it in the dishwasher if the mug starts to leak."
