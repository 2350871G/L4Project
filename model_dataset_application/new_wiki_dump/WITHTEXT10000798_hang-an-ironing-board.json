          "description":"An ideal door would be one located in your laundry room or near your laundry facilities. Hanging your ironing board in this area of your home helps you stay organized by keeping your ironing board close to other laundry items. If you don\u2019t have a laundry facility in your home, consider a place where you keep your laundry items, such as a closet that stores your detergent, laundry basket, etc. When hanging an ironing board over a door, the board can hang on either side. However, hanging the ironing board behind a door will present a more organized look as the board remains out of sight. While the over-the-door hanging method is one of the best ways to store your ironing board, there are many creative options out there."

          "description":"Measure your ironing board by width and length and compare it to the dimensions of the door. Another helpful way to consider measurements is simply holding up the ironing board to the door. Next, measure the width of the top of your door. This is very important for the over-the-door method. Keep this measurement in mind as you shop for your ironing board hanger. You don\u2019t want to buy a bracket hanger that won\u2019t fit your door. The measurements for a full size ironing board is usually between 42 by 14 inches (107 cm \u00d7 36 cm) and 48 by 18 inches (122 cm \u00d7 46 cm). While most ironing board hangers should fit standard door frames, it is possible for some older homes to have unique doors with different measurements."

So each side of the base should fit perfectly. For V-shaped and U-shaped boards, you will need to adjust the movable hooks and hang the board feet accordingly. Make sure that the feet are secure and will not slide off of the hooks. The best way to hang an ironing board is with the pointed end at the top. The wider end will likely be heavier, and you want to make sure that this end is at the bottom. Make sure that your board is secure to keep it from falling as you open and close the door. If you purchase a hanger with a space to store your iron and other accessories, make sure that your iron and accessories are also secure and neatly placed. Always wrap the cord of your iron neatly around the iron itself or tied together. You never want a loose cord hanging from the door."
