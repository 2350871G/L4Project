Planting them in a nearby area would ensure a steady supply of Logs, and also give you an easily-accessible place to trigger the transformation. In RoG, there\u2019s a new type of tree called the Birchnut Tree, which drops Birchnuts instead. Birchnuts can be cooked, unlike pinecones, but it\u2019s better to plant it than eating it."

This is because the aftermath of a Werebeaver transformation weakens Woodie thoroughly, with only 50 points each of all three gauges. This is not a very good position to find yourself when you have no weapons, no armor, and no resources. Most of the necessities require a Science Machine, however, so best make one as soon as possible. Science Machines are made through the Science tab, represented by an atom icon, for 1 Gold Nugget, 4 Logs, and 4 Rocks. Afterwards, place it down on the ground, and start learning recipes! You can\u2019t move the Science Machine after placing it though, so make sure the area is safe. Backpacks can be made for 4 each of Twigs and Cut Grass, and you can learn to make them on your Science Machine\u2019s Survival tab, represented by a looped rope. Chests require 3 boards, another thing you can make in the Refine tab (diamond icon), and you can learn to make them on your Science Machine\u2019s Structures tab, represented by a wooden hammer. You can make Healing Salves from Ashes left over from your campfires and a Spider Gland from when you kill spiders. You need a Science Machine to learn this, and they can be made under the Survival tab. Weapons and armor can be made in the Fight tab, represented by two crossed swords. At the very least, make a Spear and a Log Suit to place in your survival kit to help prolong Woodie\u2019s life post-transformation. Spears require 1 Flint, 2 Twigs, and a Rope; Log Suits need 8 Logs and 2 Ropes; and you can learn to make both of these recipes through your Science Machine. Food like Jerky, Popcorn, and Pierogi last about 20 days and heal you for a bit of all three stats, while Honey, Seeds, and Butter last 40 but are less filling and restorative. Consider stockpiling food that last more than ten days at least before transforming. You\u2019ll need a Farm Plot, a Drying Rack, and a Crock Pot to make the first three food items mentioned, while the latter three can be found by killing bees, on the ground, or by killing Butterflies, respectively. All three mentioned structures can be made in the Food tab, represented by a carrot icon."
