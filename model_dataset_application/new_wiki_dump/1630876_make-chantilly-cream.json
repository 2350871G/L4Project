A bit of patience and strong arms (or a friend who'll lend a hand) are nice to have, too. A balloon whisk helps to incorporate lots of air into the cream as you whip, creating an airier, lighter product. Chef Leslie Bilderback recommends what she calls a \"ludicrously oversized bowl\" because the more surface area the cream has, the faster it will whip. Always chill your mixing bowl ahead of time. A stainless-steel mixing bowl is your best choice because it'll hold the chill longer, but you can also use porcelain or glass. To keep your cream extra cold while working, you can also set the mixing bowl inside a larger bowl that you've filled halfway with ice."

  "text":" Whipping Cream by Hand Pick up two essential tools. You'll need an extremely large stainless-steel mixing bowl and a large balloon whisk to properly whip cream by hand.

A balloon whisk helps to incorporate lots of air into the cream as you whip, creating an airier, lighter product.

You can use a mixer with a whisk or whip attachment; however, since this is a classic French recipe, you may prefer to use this classic method of whipping by hand. Classic Chantilly Cream Prepare the dairy. Chill the cream and milk in the refrigerator. Once they're cold, mix the 1 cup cream with 1/3 cup of milk. Whip. Pour the cream and milk into your chilled bowl and begin whipping until the mixture becomes frothy and soft peaks begin to form. Add the remaining ingredients. Add the caster (superfine) sugar and the vanilla extract to the mixture. You can make a vanilla sugar that incorporates both of these ingredients and add that to the whipped cream instead. Keep whipping. Whip the cream to distribute the vanilla and sugar. Continue whipping until the cream sticks to the coils of the whisk. When stiff peaks begin to form, stop and serve the cream immediately. Otherwise, you may refrigerate it for a short time until it's needed. Chocolate Chantilly Cream Combine the cream and the chocolate. Combine a cup of heavy cream with two ounces of chocolate. Choose dark or milk chocolate based on your preference. Chop up the chocolate or simply buy chocolate chips and use those.

Whip. Whip until soft peaks form and add sugar if you like. A good guideline to follow is 2 tablespoons of sugar for every cup of cream. You can stop right here or continue to whip until the cream forms stiff peaks. Serve immediately. Vegan Chantilly Cream Refrigerate. Place the can of coconut milk in the refrigerator and allow it chill overnight. Do not shake the can. Scoop out the cream. Remove the can of coconut milk from the refrigerator and open it. The coconut cream should be sitting firmly on top. Use a spoon to scoop out the solid cream into your chilled mixing bowl. Leave the clear coconut liquid behind in the can.
