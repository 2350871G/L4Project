Take a look at your calendar and note any holidays that are coming up. Choose a holiday, then find items related to that holiday. You don\u2019t just have to stick to holidays, however. You could use bright yellow and blue for spring and summer, stick with earth tones for the fall, and use white and metallic colors for winter, for example."

Here are some ideas to get you started:\nChristmas: starburst mints or mini candy canes\nEaster: chocolate eggs\nHalloween: candy corn, chocolate eyeballs, or mini trick-or-treat candy\nSt. Patrick's Day: chocolate coins, skittles, or M&Ms\nValentine's Day: red cinnamon hearts or conversation hearts"
