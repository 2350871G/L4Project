You can do this by either by taking down blinds and drapes, or installing blinds and drapes that have less of a presence. In the end, the more natural light you let in and the less stuff crowding your windows and walls, the more open your home will feel. If you desire window coverings for privacy, choose light or sheer curtains for a breezy look. If you do have blinds or other window treatments, keep them open during the day."

          "description":"Light tends to open rooms and spaces much more than anything else you can do. To add more light, open your blinds or install more or brighter lights. Ultimately, a brighter space will appear bigger to you and your guests. Put sconces over your bed or add lights under your cabinets. Try replacing old bulbs with brighter LED or other types of bulbs before you install new lighting. Opt for cool white or \u201cdaylight\u201d light instead of warm yellow or orange light. Add a table lamp, free standing lamp, or install some recessed lighting to add light to a space."

Mirrors are an easy way to create the appearance of more space in areas that may feel cramped. Look around your home to see where you can put a mirror. You could also put mirrors in guest bedrooms, mud rooms, and bathrooms. Place a mirror above your kitchen sink if it faces a wall to make the room look large and bright."
