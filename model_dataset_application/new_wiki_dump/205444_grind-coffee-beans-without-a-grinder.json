Put on the lid and pulse the beans in two-second pulses for about 10 seconds. Add the next quarter of beans and repeat. Continue until you have the right quantity of coffee and the right consistency, about a minute. When you're done grinding, wash the blender thoroughly to remove the coffee aroma. A blender is ideal for grinding coffee in a pinch, but you won\u2019t get a consistent or fine grind. A blender is great for achieving a coarse grind. Pulse the beans only in short bursts to prevent the blades from heating up and cooking the beans."

Check the consistency of the grind, and continue processing the beans in short spurts until you have the consistency you want. Disassemble and wash the food processor when you're finished, otherwise, the coffee smell will linger. Like a blender, a food processor will only give you a coarse and uneven grind, but the coffee will still be drinkable."

With your other hand, swirl the pestle around to mash the beans. After five seconds, pull out the pestle and bring it down in a vertical motion to hammer the beans. Repeat the swirling and hammering until you achieve the desired consistency. Only grind small quantities of beans at a time in the pestle and mortar. This will ensure the most consistent grind.

Lay your open palm against the flat top of the blade and apply pressure to crack the beans. Once the beans have cracked, carefully slide the knife toward you. Continue applying pressure to grind the beans finer. Using this method, you'll be able to achieve a medium or medium-fine grind."

With gentle force, bring the rolling pin down onto the beans like a hammer to crack them. Once cracked, apply pressure and roll the rolling pin back and forth until you get the right grind. You can also place the beans between sheets of parchment paper if you don\u2019t have a freezer bag at your disposal. Using the rolling pin will result in a medium fine to fine grind."
