          "description":"Simply pour 1/4 to 1/2 cup of white vinegar to the laundry load during the rinse cycle and your clothes should come out clean and static free. This is an especially good choice for cotton clothing or sheets, but it doesn\u2019t do as well with fleece or polyester. The vinegar will also keep soap residue off the clothes as they\u2019re rinsed."

          "description":"A popular product known as Static Guard is one such product which can eliminate static charge in clothes after they dry. Sprays contain special compounds which discharge static electricity in clothes. They can be applied to freshly cleaned clothes to make them static-free. Simply point the nozzle at the article of clothing in question and squeeze the top. A mist of aerosolized liquid will eject from the can. If you don't want to purchase a spray, you can create one at home by mixing fabric softener and water in a spray bottle. Approximately one bottle cap of fabric softener mixed into a standard-size spray bottle will create an effective homemade substitute for Static Guard and similar products."

          "description":"Fabric softeners are liquid concoctions of chemicals used to make fabric softer. They impart a pleasant odor to your clothes and are capable of preventing static cling in laundry as well. Popular brands include Downy, Bounce, and Snuggle. Each softener has directions on the back of the container. Generally, you must pour them into your washing machine during the rinse cycle, then allow the cycle to run as normal. Check your washing machine for a built-in fabric softener dispenser. If it has one, pour the fabric softener into it so that the fabric softener will be automatically dispensed into the washing machine at the right time. If there\u2019s no such dispenser, you can simply add the liquid to the washing machine itself after adding the clothes. You can also purchase laundry detergent with fabric softener added to it. This type of detergent provides the same results that a fabric softener does, without adding the extra step of having to manually pour fabric softener into your machine."

Fill a standard size spray bottle with distilled water and give the handle one good pump across the surface of your clothes from a distance of approximately two feet."

If you have to use a dryer, take your clothes out of it as soon as they are sufficiently dry or while they are still slightly damp. Over-drying your clothes can lead to static cling. Static electricity is a product of friction between two electrically insulating materials.

Synthetic materials like polyester, nylon, rayon, and acetate tend to develop high levels of static cling after washing. Natural fabrics like cotton, wool, linen, and silk, on the other hand, tend to stay relatively static-free. Washing and drying natural and synthetic fibers in the same cycles can result in static cling on all your clothes, so it\u2019s a good idea to wash them separately. Alternately, you could choose to dry the natural materials in the machine and dry the synthetic materials on the line."

While letting your clothes dry on the rack or on the line, run a humidifier. A humid atmosphere makes the air more conductive than the clothes for the buildup of static charges, which essentially makes the clothes a less attractive target. Running a humidifier during especially dry seasons like winter will also prevent buildup of static electricity on your clothes and body. A drying rack is a small rack of wood or plastic with several parallel rungs upon which clothing can be set to dry."
