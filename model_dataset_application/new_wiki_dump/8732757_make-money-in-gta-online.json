Also, keep in mind that you'll always get only half the amount of money you spent on the vehicle. For example, if you buy a car with buy price $2,000,000 and you spend another $200,000 on modifying it, your sell price will be $1,100,000. You cannot sell vehicles obtained from Warstock Cache and Carry if they require Pegasus for delivery, or ones obtained through glitches or exploits."
