  "text":" Clapping with One Hand Extend the palm of your dominant hand. Maintain a comfortable, relaxed hand position and keep your fingers spread. Quickly extend your fingers and snap them into the palm of your hand. Focus on extending your fingers nice and wide before each snap. Practice repeating this motion several times in sequence. The goal is to create an audible clapping noise each time your hand comes together. Repeat this motion with your non dominant hand. Once you have perfected the noise with both hands, you can even try clapping both at the same time. Snapping Your Fingers Press your thumb and middle finger of the same hand together. Apply as much pressure as you can without hurting either finger. Relax all other fingers but keep your wrist straight and still. Your wrist is only used for support and you won't use your other fingers at all. Quickly slide your middle finger off your thumb, causing your middle finger to strike the palm of your hand. Because your middle finger and thumb were pressed together, this should happen quickly and result in a \u201csnap\u201d sound. Repeat the snapping motion for the duration of the time you wish to be \"clapping.\"  Using a Second Surface Open the palm of your hand, as you would if you had both your hands free to actually clap. Maintain a relatively relaxed hand position. Find a second surface available. This could be your leg, the program you are holding in your other hand, or something else that is near you. Try to have this surface chosen before the need to clap arises. This will help you clap smoothly instead of appearing frantic as you find something to use. Don't use anything that will disturb another person, such as a shared armrest that might shake their chair. Repeatedly strike the second surface with your open palm.
