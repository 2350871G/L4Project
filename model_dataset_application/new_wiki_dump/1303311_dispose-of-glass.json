          "description":"Ultimately, whether or not you can recycle your specific piece of glass depends upon the area where you live. Mirrors, window glass, and other large pieces of glass have a different chemical composition than standard bottle glass, and many recycling plants may not accept them. If your municipality does accept window glass, etc., then they'll likely have a specific process for it. Contact them and follow any specific instructions. This process will most likely involve taking the glass down to a recycling center since the trucks that run recycling routes aren't typically equipped for nonstandard items."

Different companies will handle waste of different sizes. For truly large pieces of glass, your waste management company may not dispose of it in a single piece. You'll likely find information with weight and dimension restrictions on the company's website or by calling. If they tell you you\u2019ll need to break up the pane first, then the second method will be more suited to your needs."

Since multiple waste management personnel will have to handle the glass, you want to help ensure that it doesn't break and become a hazard in the process. Start by covering the surface of the glass with duct tape. Tape across the glass will help keep the pieces in place and limit splintering in the event that is does break. Tape both the front and back surfaces of the glass. The more of the surface you cover the better, but if you don't want to waste a large amount of tape, then you can simply place a large X across the front and back surfaces."

Thick outdoor trash bags are preferable because they are less likely to puncture and tear. In addition to using thick trash bags, you should actually place a second trash bag inside the first before you start putting the broken glass inside. It\u2019s much easier to double-bag the clean-up effort before you start rather than trying to fit a jagged trash bag inside a second one later."

Use the hose attachment to get the entire area up to approximately fifteen feet away since broken glass can fly quite far. Make sure you use the hose attachment on a shop vac. A conventional rolling vacuum will only crush the glass into even tinier shards and it lacks the suction power of the hose. Many people are tempted to use a broom to sweep up the glass instead of a vacuum, but glass shards can easily trap in the bristles of your broom only to be redistributed later. A vacuum is a safer method."

For an easy and economical way to capture those pieces of glass dust, you can get a piece of soft bread from the kitchen and blot it face down across the area to trap the remainder of the glass. Though bread is the item you most likely already have in your home, other household items can work well in this case too. A halved potato, packing or duct tape, or a lint roller also work well for this purpose. Make sure you do not accidentally touch the area of the item with the glass stuck to it."
