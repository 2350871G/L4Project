      "description":"If you get too frustrated with a game, you're more likely to make errors. This will undeniably lead to deaths in-game, which will ultimately result in an earlier game over. Taking breaks when you get annoyed is definitely a must if you plan on playing this style of game."

      "description":"In most shoot 'em ups, you are granted a certain amount of \"bombs\", which generally do a huge amount of damage to all enemies on screen, or even eliminate all the bullets currently on the screen. Don't use them when there aren't many enemies, that's a waste and you'll regret it when you're in a pinch."

      "headline":"Practice.",
      "description":"Like most games, you must always practice if you hope to truly become better. Without sharpening, any tool would grow dull. In this case, your fingers are the tools. Don't let them grow slower in the time it takes them to react and dodge bullets. Even if it appears as if your practice is in vane, you're slowly developing muscle memory, which will make you perform better."
