Make sure not to rub the stain; instead, use a light hand and dab with patting movements, starting from the center of the stain and working out. Dabbing at the stain works especially well for fresh stains, because moistening the stain prevents it from spreading and setting in the fabric. If the stain is fresh, dabbing at the stain may be enough to absorb and remove the stain."

To more aggressively combat the stain, create a solution that is one part glycerin, one part dishwashing detergent and 8 parts water. If you just have a small stain, use one teaspoon or tablespoon of glycerin and dishwashing detergent and 8 teaspoons or tablespoons of water. Stir the detergent solution to mix thoroughly."

If the stain has been completely removed, flush the garment with water to remove any detergent solution or rubbing alcohol, then hang the garment up to dry. Soak the fabric in water and baking soda, then wash. If hand-removing the stain hasn\u2019t worked, soak the fabric in a solution of one part water and one part baking soda for 10-15 minutes. Then launder as usual in the washer and dryer. Removing Stains From Silk or Triacetate Flush the stain with water. Run water over the perfume stain on the silk or triacetate. Though silk and triacetate are not very absorbent materials, try to saturate the stained area with water. Water stops fresh stains from setting, and helps old stains separate from the fabric so that they can get removed. Add a couple drops of glycerin to the stain. After flushing with water, drop on a few drops of glycerin and use your finger to gently dap the glycerin to cover the stained area.

Flush with water and dry the silk. After you have removed the stain from your silk, flush the garment with water to remove any remnants of the cleaning agents you used. Then hang your silk garment out to dry. Removing Stains From Leather or Suede Blot any excess perfume. Use a dry wad of paper towel or cheesecloth to blot the leather or suede with gentle tapping motions. This works especially well with fresh stains, but may not be effective with older, dried stains. Never use water on leather or suede. Make a solution of soap and water. Fill a large bowl halfway full with lukewarm water, then add a squirt of mild liquid soap to the water. Swish the water around by shaking the bowl or by swirling your hand around in the water to create suds. Scoop up the foam and apply it to the stain. Use your hands to scoop up the suds and bubbles you created, then add the suds to a clean sponge. Sponge the suds onto the stain and pat the stain gently. Wipe the stain dry. After you pat in the suds into the stain, use a dry paper towel or cloth to wipe the suds away from the fabric. You should see that the soap suds have worked to partially or completely remove the stain. Add cornmeal to the stain. If the stain is still visible in the leather or suede, sprinkle on enough cornmeal to lightly cover the stain. Let the cornmeal sit for about half an hour. Cornmeal works by lifting and absorbing the stain. Brush off the cornmeal. After you have let the cornmeal sit for around half an hour, use a dry, stiff-bristled brush to delicately brush the cornmeal off of the leather or suede.
