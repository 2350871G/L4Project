You can look up your local hardiness zone here: http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/\n\nNew Mexico, for example, can be broken into 3 primary climate zones, and the average growing season varies in length by more than 30 days among these zones."

This micro-climate will have a major impact on your gardening operation. Even within a single climate zone, the growing season can vary by up to 20 days based on your specific location. Valleys stay cooler than hills, and southern slopes warm up faster than northern ones, to name a few examples.

Growing plants near masonry walls or using dark landscaping fabric over the soil, both of which will absorb heat from the sun, can keep plants warm well into cooler nights. Trap solar warmth by placing glass jars over your seedlings from late in the day through early morning. Warm the bases of crops like tomatoes by placing dark plastic bags filled with water on the ground around them. You can also buy or build plastic grow tunnels that trap in heat while allowing ventilation, or even take it to the next level with a greenhouse."

A layer of 2\u20133 centimetres (0.79\u20131.18 in) of organic mulch will keep soil cooler and more moist, and white plastic or even aluminum foil ground coverings can reflect some of the sun\u2019s radiant heat. Use shade cloths to protect your vegetables from the intense mid-summer heat. You can also construct a simple ramada (a shade structure made of poles and branches) to provide partial shade.

This means you need to establish a regular watering plan and stick to it through the growing season. Before your seeds germinate, you\u2019ll want to water the ground fairly lightly every 2-3 days. Once they germinate, allow the top inch (2.5 cm) of soil to completely dry out between waterings. When you do add water, soak the soil so that it\u2019s moist to a depth of about a foot (30 cm). Depending on your soil and climate, you may be watering every 3 days or every 12."

Sprinklers and even garden hoses can also cause crusting of the soil\u2019s surface, which inhibits moisture and nutrient penetration. Drip irrigation, using evenly-spaced drip lines that snake through your garden, reduces water waste and gets the moisture right where it needs to be. Furrow irrigation, in which water channels run alongside the raised rows for the plants, is also popular in the Southwest. You fill the furrows with water on a regular schedule and let the moisture absorb into your plants\u2019 root systems."
