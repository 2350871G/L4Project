  "text":" Making the pattern Trace around the scissors onto paper to form the template. Leave an additional 0.5 centimeter (0.2 in) around the scissors shape when you trace it onto the paper, or leave even more space for larger scissors. Cut out the paper pattern. Use the pattern to cut out two pieces of felt. You'll need one piece each for the front and back of the case. As you cut, make sure to leave enough space around the design. Decorating the scissors case Decorate the case with the scissors pattern. On what will form the top side of the felt, draw the appearance of your scissors on the felt with tailor's chalk. See the image for guidance. Repeat with both pieces of felt if you like. Embroider the outlined scissors pattern with running stitch. Choose a thread color that complements the fabric nicely. Decorate the case. Use paint, markers, glitter, buttons or other glue-ons, or anything else you like. Be creative, and do as much or as little decorating as you want. Adding lining Add cotton lining to the scissors case. Cut out two pieces of cotton lining 2mm smaller than the felt fabric pieces. This should be a thin piece of cotton that you can easily attach to the case without weighing it down or bulking it up. It will add strength and durability to your case and keep the scissors from catching on the felt when slipped in and out. Glue the cotton lining to the felt. Make sure you glue the cotton to the bottom or inside of the felt, rather than the outside - you don't want it to cover up any of your decorations. Use Tacky Glue to secure the lining, but be careful not to use too much as it can soak through the felt and leave unsightly stains. Finishing the case Assemble the case. Lay the two pieces of felt together, with the attached lining sides facing inward towards each other. Sew along the edges and base of the scissors case. Make sure to sew as close as possible to the outside of the felt - sewing too far in from the edge will limit the amount of space inside the case and possibly make it too small for the scissors. Do not sew the top; this is where the scissors are pushed in and pulled out from. Finished. Check that your scissors fit snugly and it's all set to use.",
