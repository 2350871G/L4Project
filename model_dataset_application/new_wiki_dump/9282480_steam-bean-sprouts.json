At the other end, the sprouts attach to the beans they grew from. Cut off both parts so you\u2019re left with a bunch of white stalks. If you bought the sprouts at a grocery store, they are most likely pre-cut, so you won\u2019t have to do this."

The other is a basket that attaches to the pot\u2019s rim. Either one works for well for steaming bean sprouts. For some pots, the water will be right under the steamer basket. This is fine. As long as the water doesn\u2019t get in the basket, the water level can be as high as you make it."

With a lid on, they\u2019ll most likely be finished within two to four minutes. When finished, the normally white sprouts will look a little translucent. You\u2019ll be able to easily slice them with a knife, but they\u2019ll still be crunchy when you eat them. If the beans aren\u2019t finished, continue steaming them.

Now that they\u2019re steamed, they\u2019ll add crunch to whatever dish you choose to use them in. Some options for sprouts are adding them to salads, serving them on sandwiches, or mixing them with meat. The beans are best when eaten right away. When stored in a sealed container, they\u2019ll last up to five days in the refrigerator and eight months in the freezer."
