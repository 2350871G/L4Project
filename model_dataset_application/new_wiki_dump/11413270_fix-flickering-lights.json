Wiring problems would affect multiple fixtures and maybe even the whole building. Check the other lights in your home. If only one or two are flickering, then the problem is probably not with your home\u2019s wiring."

          "description":"Whether the flickering light is on a fixture or appliance, start by turning the switch off. Then wait a few minutes for the bulb to cool down so you don\u2019t burn yourself. If you don\u2019t want to wait for the bulb to cool, you could wrap a towel or oven mitt around your hand to protect it from the heat. Never try to adjust electrical appliances while the power is on. Always turn the power off first."

Turn the bulb clockwise to tighten it. Stop turning the bulb when it won\u2019t go any further. Overtightening can damage the socket or even crack the bulb. You could cut yourself if the bulb breaks in your hand. Some lightbulb sockets spin along with the bulb, so you need two hands to tighten it. Hold the socket with one hand to keep it still while you turn the bulb with the other hand."
