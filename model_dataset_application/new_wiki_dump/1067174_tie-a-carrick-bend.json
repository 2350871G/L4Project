  "text":" Using One Rope Make a loop with the rope. It may help if you use a horizontal bar as a hitch to help you tie a Carrick Bend. Take the shorter end and loop it over the longer end, pulling it up straight.  Move the shorter end down, underneath the point where the rope initially crossed to make your first loop.  Tighten both ends of the rope.  Using Two Ropes Place a second rope directly over the first one. Loop it under the long end of the first rope, but over the short end. Then, create another loop with the second one. Bring the end you just used in the previous step back over the long end, cross over the second rope over itself, and then finish it under the short end. Cinch the knot by applying tension to all four ends of the ropes equally. ",
