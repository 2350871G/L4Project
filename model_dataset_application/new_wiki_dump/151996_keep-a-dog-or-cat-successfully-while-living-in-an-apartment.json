Some of these charges can be very high, so consider them before moving in or getting a new pet. Pet rent. This could vary from $5-$10 a month to much higher. Pet fee.

Consider the following:\nYour cat probably won\u2019t be able to roam freely outdoors. You\u2019ll have to walk your dog before and after work, rather than just letting them out into your fenced yard. Your future apartment community might not have a lot of green space. Many dogs are picky about where they pee and poop.

For the owners of male cats, your cat might be less prone to spraying after being neutered. Spaying will also eliminate problems associated with cats and dogs in heat.

This way, you\u2019ll be able to let your dog off leash and he/she will be able to run around and play with other dogs. Be careful, though, and supervise your pet.
