Place the frozen bagel in a toaster oven or regular oven set to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) for approximately 5 minutes to defrost it. Tip: Wait until the bagel is crusty and warm in the middle to eat it for the closest thing to a fresh-baked bagel. The oven or toaster oven does not need to be preheated for this method. Bagels are cooked by boiling, then baking, so this method is the closest thing to replicating the original cooking process of the bagel."
