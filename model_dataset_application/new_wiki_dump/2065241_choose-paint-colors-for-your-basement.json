          "description":"It is a common misconception that dark rooms should be painted light colors. In fact, light colors need an abundance of light to realize their potential; otherwise they tend to look drab, dull, and even dirty. The best way to counter the low light levels in a basement is by painting with rich, deep hues. Basement paint colors do not necessarily need to be dark, but they should be richly saturated. So, a highly saturated, medium-toned turquoise will often perform better than a dark-toned gray paint. If you prefer neutral colors, like beige or gray, choose a slightly richer shade, like a chocolate brown or deep slate, instead."

          "description":"Choosing the right sheen is an important part of choosing your basement paint. The type of sheen can determine how light reflects off your painted walls (an especially important consideration for a basement), how visible imperfections in the walls are, and also how easy it will be to keep the space looking clean. If your basement is damp and tends be affected by mold, choose a satin paint finish. These kinds of paints can withstand moisture better than other types. Avoid matte paints. Matte paints are harder to clean, and they won't reflect light, which will make your basement seem darker."

For instance, if you have exposed brick walls, you might want to consider painting the adjacent wall a cool, refreshing color like mint green or pale blue. For rooms with finished drywall walls and carpeted floors, richer colors would be more appropriate. Consider creating contrast by pairing dark floors with a lighter wall color."

Of course, there's no way to change that. But you can keep that in mind when deciding what kind of paint you choose and how much additional lighting you may need. If your space is darker in the winter months because of the decreased natural light, you might want to consider using richly saturated paint colors combined with additional lighting that you can use when needed. Trade warm-colored bulbs for white LED lights. These LEDs can brighten up the room and give off more light while saving on energy costs."

These partitioned walls can often make a space feel more closed off. Of course, be careful not to remove any important load-bearing walls. Consult a structural engineer before making any decisions to remove walls."
