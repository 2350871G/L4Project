Capturing Stones from Your Opponent\u2019s Side Identify a move that would end on an empty cup on your side. You have to have enough stones in the cup to go all the way around the board and back to your own side. By placing your last stone into an empty cup on your side, you can capture your opponent\u2019s stones in the opposite cup. Look for a cup that would allow you to do this.

For example, if you see an empty cup on your side and spot a cup 2 spaces away with 2 stones in it, then pick up these stones to make the move.Tip: This move works best after you and your opponent have taken several turns. You won't have any empty stones at the beginning of the game. Place 1 stone into each space going counter-clockwise. After you pick up your stones, drop only 1 into each cup ahead of that cup. Move counter-clockwise around the board. Keep dropping 1 stone at a time until you reach the last space, then drop that stone as well. Collect the stones in your opponent\u2019s cup across from your cup. As long as the last cup you dropped a stone into was on your side and empty, you may capture the stones in your opponent\u2019s cup. You also get the stone you placed into your cup. For example, if there are 4 stones in your opponent\u2019s cup, then  capture those 4 plus your 1 stone for a total of 5 stones. Remember, it does not matter how many stones are in your opponent\u2019s cup. Whether there is 1, 2, 3 or more stones in a cup, you get to capture them all using this strategy! Place your opponent\u2019s stones and your stone into your mancala. Once you have gathered up your stones and your opponent\u2019s stones, place them into your mancala. These stones are now yours. If your board does not have mancalas, then place the stones you capture into a dish or pile in front of you. Note that after you capture, your turn is over and it is your opponent\u2019s turn. Using the Wari Variation to Capture Determine if you will be playing by Wari rules before you start. In this variation, you can capture stones the normal way, or depending on the number of stones in your opponent\u2019s cups. If the last cup you place stones in on your turn is an opponent\u2019s cup with 2 or 3 stones in it, capture the stones in that cup. You can also take the stones in any other preceding cups with 2 or 3 stones in them. For example, if you place 1 stone into 4 of your opponent\u2019s cups and they each have 2 or 3 stones in them after you do this, then you can capture the stones in all 4 cups. However, if only the first and last cup out of 4 have 2 or 3 stones in them, then you can only capture the stones in these cups. Look for cups that have 1 or 2 stones and target those cups.

If you place stones into your opponent\u2019s cups and the last cup has 2 or 3 stones, capture those stones and place them into your mancala. These stones are yours now. Gather the stones in previous cups if they also have 2 to 3. Make sure to check the previous cups that you dropped stones into as well. If any cup before the last one has 2 to 3 stones in it, then you may also collect these stones. After you finish your capture move, let your opponent take their turn.",
