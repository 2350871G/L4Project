If you experience any of these side effects while using THC, stop using it immediately. Side effects of THC may include:\nDizziness\nDifficulty concentrating and remembering things\nIncreased heart rate\nSlowed reaction time\nIncreased appetite\nVomiting repeatedly\nHallucinations Warning: Be aware that THC may improve anxiety for some people, but for others it can intensify their anxiety symptoms."

Check the manufacturer\u2019s instructions or ask your doctor if you are unsure what that might be. Note that it is more difficult to control the dose with THC products that you inhale, such as vaporized oil or buds that you smoke in a pipe."

          "description":"Using THC every day will cause your tolerance to build. As time goes on, you will require more and more THC to get the same effect. For this reason, it\u2019s best to limit how often you use THC to when you really need it and to avoid using it over a long period of time, such as 1 month or more. For example, you might reserve your THC doses for situations when you anticipate feeling anxious, or wait until you start getting symptoms of anxiety to take a dose."

It only masks the symptoms temporarily, and once the THC wears off, your symptoms may return. Continue to work with your doctor or therapist to address the root cause of your anxiety and learn tools to help you cope.

Ask friends and check ratings online to determine where to purchase marijuana. Then, choose a strain of marijuana that is known to have relaxing properties, such as a sativa instead of an indica strain. Indica strains may increase anxiety while sativa strains are more relaxing.
