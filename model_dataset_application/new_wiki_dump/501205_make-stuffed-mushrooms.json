  "text":" Simple Stuffed Mushrooms Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F (204\u00b0C).  Create the filling of the mushrooms. To make the filling for the stuffed mushrooms, stir together 1/2 cup Italian-style dried bread crumbs, 1/2 cup grated Pecorino Romano, 2 peeled and minced garlic cloves, 2 tbsp. chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves, and 2 tbsp. olive oil in a medium bowl. Stir well to blend the ingredients together. Salt and pepper to taste.  Drizzle 1 tbsp. of olive oil over a heavy large baking sheet. Coat the sheet in the oil. This will prevent the mushrooms from burning or sticking to the sheet. Remove the stems from 28 large (2 1/2-inch-diameter) mushrooms. Wipe off the mushrooms with a paper towel to clean them. Removing the stems will create a nice cavity for the filling. Spoon the filling into the mushroom cavities.  Drizzle the remaining olive oil over the filling in each mushroom. This will make the filling taste even richer. Bake the mushrooms for about 25 minutes. Place the stuffed mushrooms in the oven once it's ready. Bake them until they're tender and the filling is heated and golden on top. Serve. Enjoy these mushrooms as the perfect side dish, or even as an entr\u00e9e. Stuffed Mushrooms with Bacon Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).  Remove the stems from 1 lb. of button mushrooms. Chop the stems finely -- you'll be using in the stuffing. You should also scoop out a bit of the insides of the mushrooms with a spoon to make room for the stuffing. Make the stuffing. Place 3 slices of finely-chopped bacon, 1/2 cup of chopped onion, 1 finely-chopped clove of garlic, and the chopped stems together in a frying pan. Saut\u00e9 them together in 2 tbsp. of olive oil. Cook them until the onion is soft and the stems have softened. This should take about 3-5 minutes. Drain the olive oil from the mixture.  Stir in the remaining ingredients.

Place the stuffing in the mushroom caps.  Place the mushroom caps on a cookie sheet.  Bake them for 10 minutes. Bake them for ten minutes -- long enough for the cheese to melt, but not long enough to burn the ingredients. Serve. Enjoy this delicious treat on its own or with a dollop of sour cream. Baked Stuffed Mushrooms with Crab Stem 24 large mushrooms. Just pop off their stems and gently scoop out their insides with a spoon. Butter a 10 x 15-inch baking dish.  Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).  Make the egg mixture. Combine 1 large egg, 1 large tbsp. of mayonnaise, 1 tbsp. of lemon juice, 1 tsp. of dry mustard, 1 tsp. of Worcestershire sauce, and 1/4 tsp. of salt in a medium bowl.

Pour the egg mixture over the crab mixture. Mix the ingredients together gently, being careful not to break up the crab. Stuff the mushroom caps with the crab mixture. Mound the mixture in the center and press it gently to have it stick to the mushrooms. Arrange the mushrooms on the baking dish. Separate them from one another. Place the baking dish in the center of the oven. Bake the mushrooms for about 18 minutes, until they begin to release their juices. Make the topping sauce. While the mushrooms are baking, you should whisk together the other large egg, 1 cup of mayonnaise, 1 tbsp. of lemon juice, and 2 tbsp. of half and half in a small bowl. Remove the mushrooms from the oven.  Drizzle each mushroom with the topping sauce. This will give them an even richer flavor. Bake the mushrooms for 8 more minutes.

Make a blue cheese filling. Mix 2 tbsp. of chopped walnuts, 1 peeled and diced pear, and 1/8 oz. (4 g.) of blue cheese together. Season with salt and pepper to taste. This filling will be sweet, creamy, and crunchy. Make a butter mix. Mix 1 3/4 oz. (50 g.) of butter, 3 cloves of minced garlic, 2 tbsp. of chopped parsley, 3 tbsp. of bread crumbs and 1 tbsp. of Parmesan together in another bowl. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
