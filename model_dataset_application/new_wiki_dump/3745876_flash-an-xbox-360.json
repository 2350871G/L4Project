If your Drive Revision section has the \"78/79\" option selected, you will need to burn an extra CD to unlock the drive. Click the \"Insert the 79 Unlock Audio CD\" link, which will open your browser and attempt to download a file. Save the file and then extract it. Burn the BIN file to a blank CD-R using your favorite image burning program. See this guide for more details. Turn on Mode-B. In the Hitachi GDR3120 tab, click the Send Mode-B button. A window will appear with instructions, but these can be ignored since you're using the USB connector tool. Insert the unlock disc. After you are in Mode-B, click the Open button to open the drive tray. Insert the disc and then click the Close button. Click the 79 Unlock button to read the disc. The drive will eject the disc automatically when finished. This step is only required if you have a version 79 drive. Dump the drive data. In the \"Flashing Options\" section, make sure the \"Dump Drive\" option is selected, and then click the Read to Source button. Save the drive data backup file somewhere easily accessible in case you want to restore the drive later. Save your drive key. Click the Save Drive Key button and save the drive key somewhere safe. This will be useful if you want to restore your drive later. Flash the LT+ firmware. Return to the Hitachi GDR3120 tab and select \"Flash LT-Plus\" in the \"Flashing Options\" section. Click the Flash LT-Plus button. Click Yes when the program says that the flashing report is stable. Wait for the flashing process to complete. You can see the progress in the text box at the bottom of the window. Once the flashing process is complete, return to the Hitachi GDR3120 tab. Turn the DVD drive on and off (you can simply pull the power cable from the DVD drive to reset it). Start JungleFlasher. Once the drive is connected to the USB tool and your computer, you can start JungleFlasher to begin the flashing process. Unlock the drive. Click the MTK Flash 32 tab and then click the \"BenQ UnLock\" button. The DVD drive will be unlocked automatically. Wait for the drive to unlock. You will see text in the box at the bottom of the window. Once the drive has been unlocked, look for the \"Drive Properties\" section of the MTK Flash 32 tab. The \"Vendor\" field should read \"Drive in Vendor Mode\". Copy the old firmware. Click the Read button. JungleFlasher will begin reading the BenQ firmware files. After it's finished, you will be prompted to save the original firmware as a backup. Choose a location that you can easily find if you want to restore your original firmware files. Load the new firmware. After the firmware backup has been saved, you will be prompted to load the BenQ LT+ firmware files. Click Yes to proceed. Save your drive key. Click the Save Drive Key button and save the drive key somewhere safe. This will be useful if you want to restore your drive later. Save your custom firmware. Click the Save to File button to save your custom firmware files. This will make flashing the same drive in the future much easier. Write the new firmware. Click the MTK Flash 32 tab and then click the Write button. You can monitor the writing process in the text box at the bottom of the window. The writing process shouldn't take too long. Exit vendor mode. After the firmware writing is complete, click the Outro / ATA Reset to exit vendor mode on your DVD drive. This will keep your Xbox 360 from getting banned immediately from Xbox Live. The \"DVD Key\" entry in the \"Drive Properties\" section should read \"Verified\". Start JungleFlasher. Once the drive is connected to the USB tool and your computer, you can start JungleFlasher to begin the flashing process. Find the MPX01 point on the Lite-On DVD circuitry board. Flip your disassembled Lite-On drive to find the circuitry board. The MPX01 point is located on the circuitry of the DVD drive, and is where you will need to probe during the flashing process. You can find the MPX01 point next to the large chip installed on the circuitry. Get ready to probe the drive. Open the DVDKey 32 tab in JungleFlasher. Click the PhatKey button and wait a few moments for the program to load. The \"MTK Vendor Intro failed\" window will appear. You are now ready to probe the drive. Ensure that the light on the probe is on, indicating it is receiving power. Probe the drive. When the window pops up, press and hold the button on the probe cable. With the button held down, touch the probe to the MPX01 point. Release the probe cable button while continuing to hold the probe on the point. Click the Yes button on the window in JungleFlasher. Remove the probe and reset the drive. When the next window appears, you will need to remove the probe and reset the drive. Pull the probe away and kill the drive's power at the USB connector. Wait five seconds and then turn the power back on. Click OK in JungleFlasher. Save the key. After clicking OK, you will be prompted to save your extracted key. Save it somewhere that can be easily accessed. There will be multiple files that you will need to save in the same location. Load the new firmware. After the firmware backup has been saved, you will be prompted to load the Lite-On LT+ firmware files. Click Yes to proceed. Load the saved key. Click the Manual Spoofing button in the FirmwareTool 32 tab, click the Load key bin button, and select the key that you saved earlier. Save your custom firmware. Click the {button|Save to File}} button to save your custom firmware files. This will make flashing the same drive in the future much easier. Erase the drive. Click the MTK Flash 32 tab and then click the \"Lite-On Erase\" button. Click the Yes buttons in the windows that appear. As soon as \"...\" appears in the text box at the bottom of the window, reset the power to your DVD drive by either using the kill switch on the CK3 Lite or by pulling out and reinserting the power cable for the DVD drive. If you were successful, look for the \"Drive Properties\" section of the MTK Flash 32 tab. The \"Vendor\" field should read \"Drive in Vendor Mode\". Write the new firmware. Click the MTK Flash 32 tab and then click the Write button. You can monitor the writing process in the text box at the bottom of the window. The writing process shouldn't take too long. Exit vendor mode. After the firmware writing is complete, click the Outro / ATA Reset to exit vendor mode on your DVD drive.
