Use a ladder to get up on the roof and inspect if there's any damage. Then, take a flashlight with you to check the dark corners of your home in the attic and basement. Rats are terrific climbers, so don't rule out any part of your home as a possible entry point. Make sure you've checked every inch of your home if you suspect a rat infestation."

Fill the hole with steel wool and put caulk around it to keep the wool in place. For large holes, use metal sheeting. This can be found at your local hardware store. You can also use lath screen, lath metal, cement, or hardware cloth to fill up the bigger holes.Tip: To be safe, fill all of the holes you find. This includes the holes that might seem too small for a rat. This way, you can prevent other pests from getting into your home as well."
