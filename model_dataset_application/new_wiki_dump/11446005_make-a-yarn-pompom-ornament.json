  "text":" Forming the Pompoms Wrap the yarn around a round object 15-20 times very tightly in one direction. It should be tense like guitar strings. Don't worry about it overlapping or crossing. Once finished, cut off the excess ends. Do not tie the two end together. Round item can be a metal or plastic bottle cap/lid or a upholstery/drapery ring.

The thickness of the yarn and the weight can vary the appearance of the pompom as well. Experiment as you desire. Slide the yarn off the item. The result should be a yarn loop as shown in the photo above. Lay the heavy duty thread accordingly. Cut a piece of the heavy duty thread and lay it in the center of the yarn loop under it. This thread will be used to gather the loop into a bunch and will be the base of the pompom. This doesn't have to be completely precise. Tie the center of the loop created with your finger. With the heavy duty thread, bring the ends of the heavy duty thread together and tie this thread in a simple slipknot pulling tightly. The yarn loop will twist and turn as well, forming a \"bow tie\" position. Pull until the yarn stops twist and the thread can't be pulled anymore. Cut the loops of the yarn completing the pompom. Trim and shake until the pompom looks complete. Cut off as much of the two \"tails\" of the heavy duty thread as possible so it's not seen. Constructing The Ornament Form the ornament base using the beads. Get a nail or pin. Slip a round bead and then a flat disk bead through it. The flat bead on the bottom will help keep the pin centered instead of rolling out of place. Round beads will likely roll with the knot in the center of the pompom and get lost within the pompom. Push the pin with the beads into the pompom. Place the pin over the center knot as close as possible and press firmly. The thickness of the nails used here are easier to keep straight and centered rather than a thin sewing pin which can bend and warp out of shape. You'll want a nail or pin that can push easily into the foam without bending out of shape. Dip the end of the pin into glue and push the pin into the Styrofoam ball. Again, place the pin or nail over any location desired. Press firmly into the foam ball. A hardware hook tool or other sharp tool might be used to start a hole into the foam so that the pin can be inserted more easily. Repeat the pompom and pin procedures until the foam ball is completely covered. The number of pompoms needed will vary. Place pompom pins in an overlapping pattern. Do not put a pompom pin into the hole of the foam ball which can be easily used to insert a hanger for the ornament. Pinning items into this hole can be more difficult because it's larger than the thick pin. Add a small hole the ornament, if desired. Get a hairpin and dip the ends into the glue, pushing into the top of the ball for hanging. Keep in mind that some foam balls may have a hole or circle indentation to use for hanging as well which can be useful to look for. Enjoy the completed ornament! ",
