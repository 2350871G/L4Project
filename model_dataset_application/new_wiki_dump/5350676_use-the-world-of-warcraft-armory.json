Talents are class-specific abilities that you can choose from every 15 levels. In other words, level 15 characters can pick one talent out of three possible talents for their first talent, and then when they reach level 30, they are able to pick one of three possible talents for their second talent. By the time a character reaches level 90, they will have six talents (out of 18 possible choices). For more information on talents, you can look through the talent calculator. The link is right on the armory under the Talents section. You will also see Major Glyphs and Minor Glyphs in the Talents section of the armory. Major glyphs enhance a character's abilities (for example, a major glyph could increase the damage or healing of one of your abilities). Minor glyphs generally don't provide much actual benefit for your character\u2014they are usually cosmetic.
