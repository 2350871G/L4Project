          "description":"Mojitos are great refreshing cocktails that don't rely on a lot of mixers or sweeteners. To make a classic mojito that's low in carbs, smash 1 ounce of lime juice or about 4-6 lime wedges, 8 mint leaves and 1 tablespoon of zero-calorie sweetener in the bottom of a tall glass. Add ice to the glass and pour in 1 1/2 ounces of white rum. Fill the glass with club soda or seltzer water and stir before serving.For a variation on a low-carb mojito, you can use diet lemon-lime soda instead of the club soda and zero-calorie sweetener."

To make a low-carb version, use a sugar-free tonic water or a no-carb tonic water. Low-carb tonics are made with natural sweeteners like agave.
