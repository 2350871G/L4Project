          "description":"To disinfect your water, you'll need a clean pot as well as clean containers to store the water in after you've disinfected it. Your storage containers should have lids that will close tightly, to ensure the water doesn't become contaminated again. If you're reusing bottles, use soft drink bottles rather than bottles that previously held milk or fruit juice. Milk and juice sugars contribute to bacterial growth in stored water. Clean bottles thoroughly using a dish soap. You can also sanitize bottles with 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of household chlorine bleach for every quart (liter) of water."

          "description":"While disinfection kills most microorganisms that could cause health problems, it doesn't get rid of heavy metals, salts, and other chemicals. Before you disinfect your water, pour it through a cloth or coffee filter to help eliminate these contaminants. You can also let your water sit in bottles for several hours before disinfecting it. The heavier particles will settle to the bottom, and you can pour the water from the top of the bottle, leaving the sediment behind."

        {
          "headline":"Boil your water.",
          "description":"Fill a large pot or kettle with water and bring it to a rolling boil. Allow the water to boil for at least a minute and as long as 5 minutes. Some of your water will evaporate. Let the water cool before trying to drink it or pouring it into plastic bottles. Boiling water is the safest and most effective way to clean it so that it will be drinkable. Boiled water tastes better if you add oxygen to it by pouring it back and forth several times between two clean containers. If you're out in the wilderness or don't have electricity, you can still boil water over a fire, or by gradually adding externally heated rocks to the water until it begins to boil."

          "headline":"Chlorinate your water.",
          "description":"Household liquid bleach also kills microorganisms in water. Use only regular household bleach that contains between 5.25 and 6 percent sodium hypochlorite. Your bleach should be unscented, contain no other cleaners or chemicals, and come from a new or recently opened bottle. Add 16 drops of bleach to 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water. Stir and let it stand for 30 minutes. The water should have a slight bleach odor. If it doesn't, repeat the method and let it stand for another 15 minutes. Water disinfected with bleach that does not have a slight bleach odor is not safe to drink. Find another source of water, or use another method of disinfection."

          "description":"If you can't boil water and don't have any bleach, you can harness the energy of the sun to disinfect your water. All you need are some soft drink bottles with caps. Fill your bottles with water and close the caps tightly. Set the bottles out in an area where they will receive at least 6 hours of direct sunlight. After 6 hours, the water is safe to drink. This method only works with PET bottles. Glass blocks crucial UV rays that are needed to properly disinfect the water. For best results, place your bottles on a conductive material, such as a tin roof, and angle them towards the sun."

This method also removes dirt and debris from water found in a natural source, such as a stream or river. Filtering water through cloth is only the first step in the filtration process.
