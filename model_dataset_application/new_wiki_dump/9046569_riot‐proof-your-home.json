Having to climb a fence may be enough reason for potential looters to pass by your house. Building a fence all around your house is no small project. If you don\u2019t have the time or knowledge, you may be better off hiring a contractor to build it. Taller fences give you even more protection. A ten foot (3 m) fence is harder to climb than a five foot (1.5 m) fence."

It also makes it harder to get across if rioters do climb the fence. It may be safer to hire someone to attach the razor wire or barbed wire, as it is very sharp.
