Some brands will state they focus on recycling on the package, but it doesn't hurt to do a little research before you buy. You're more likely to find these brands at health food stores that also sell toiletries, like Whole Foods. Another brand, Bikini Soft, makes shaving cream, but they also have a razor recycling program."

If the razors or blades are recyclable, the box should have the tiny recycle symbol somewhere on the box, usually on the back near the bottom. The recycle symbol is a small triangle formed by 3 arrows that bend around the corners of the triangle."
