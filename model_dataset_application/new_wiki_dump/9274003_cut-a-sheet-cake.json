Instead, lay down a cutting board mat or long dish towel to keep your cake stable. If your cake came with or was decorated on a cake board, do not remove the board. Instead, move the cake and the board together. If your cake did not come with a cake board, move it to a large cutting board or cake stand before serving.

          "description":"Before you cut your cake, use a flat spatula or butter knife to score your cake along the top. Lay a ruler along the long side of your cake, and gently press the dull side of your knife or spatula into the top of cake every 2 in (5.1 cm). Then, move your ruler to the width side of your cake, and make marks in 1 in (2.5 cm), 2 in (5.1 cm), or 3 in (7.6 cm) intervals, depending upon the serving size you chose. Scoring isn\u2019t necessary. It is just a helpful tool to ensure that you get even slices before you cut. If you choose not to score, you will have to eyeball and approximate measurements, and you may not get an even cut. Do not press down too hard. You just want to make a slight indent in the top of your cake or your frosting to give you a guide when you cut. Scoring can be done in advance of your event so that you don\u2019t spend extra time in the kitchen prepping your cake."

  "text":" Setting up Your Cake Determine the size of your cake. A true sheet cake is 16 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 2 in (40.6 \u00d7 61.0 \u00d7 5.1 cm), but sheet cakes and sheet cake pans can also come in half and quarter sizes.

You just want to make a slight indent in the top of your cake or your frosting to give you a guide when you cut. Scoring can be done in advance of your event so that you don\u2019t spend extra time in the kitchen prepping your cake. Using a Knife to Cut Choose a long, thin knife. The shape of a sheet cake means that you will need a longer knife to get all the way through. Choose a knife with a long, thin blade. Avoid knives with serrated edges, as these could cause the frosting to become messy. Wipe your knife down in between every cut. Between each cut, wipe your knife down with a dish towel or paper towel. This keeps your cuts crisp, and is especially helpful if your cake has frosting. Slice vertically along your scoring line.

Working from the outer edge of your cake, press your knife down at a 45 degree angle until the tip hits the board. Then, pull your knife toward you until it comes out of the cake. Serve your cake. Slide the flat of your blade under the bottom of your cake slice and pull the slice away from the rest of the cake. Then, simply slide your slice onto a plate and serve it. Use a fork to help move the cake onto the plate if your slice is particularly stubborn. Cutting a Cake with Dental Floss Use flavorless dental floss. Flavored floss could impart an aftertaste on your cake slices. Look for an unflavored variety of dental floss. If you don\u2019t have floss, fishing wire also works wonderfully. Cut a length of floss about 4 in (10 cm) longer than your cake. You want your floss to be a little bit longer than your cake so that you have enough to wrap it around your fingers. Cut a length of floss about 4 in (10 cm) longer than your cake. This will leave about 2 in (5.1 cm) on either side to wrap the floss around your fingers. Wrap the floss around your index fingers. Wrap the ends of your floss around your index fingers. Twist the floss over each finger finger two or three times and pull it straight. Press the floss down evenly over the length of your cake. Line your floss up with your first vertical scoring line and press your floss down evenly until it reaches the board. Then, unwrap your floss from one finger. Pull the still wrapped finger back away from the cake until the floss is completely free. Repeat this process for each of your scoring lines. Change your floss between each cut. Cut a new length of floss for each scoring line and change it out between every cut. This keeps your cake cuts nice and clean.",
