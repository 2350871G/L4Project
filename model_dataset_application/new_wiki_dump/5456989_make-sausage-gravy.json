A thick or heavy-bottomed pan will hold its heat even as you add cold ingredients, leading to a better final consistency. Arrange your ingredients near you and cut open the package of sausage, waiting to add until the pan gets hot. Let the milk get to room temperature as well -- it's best if it warms up on the counter a bit before adding it, so don't leave it in the fridge because you're worried it might spoil. It won't."

          "description":"Gravy is just cooked flour in a fat, and that fat can be animal fat, butter, or both. But you can't have a completely dry pan or there will be nothing to absorb the flour and make a gravy. Butter isn't strictly necessary, but it helps if you're using a lower-fat sausage, like turkey or chicken sausage."

The best way to do this is to break the 1/3 cup of flour into three parts, adding and stirring each one in individually. Keep the whisk moving, breaking up and clumps and stirring until none of the flour is at all visible."

If you can, measure out the milk ahead of time and let it warm slightly towards room temperature. You need to add the milk slowly because you don't want to rapidly change the temperature of your gravy. Pour a bit in, stir and let it simmer, then add some more. While you need to add the milk slowly, you don't want to dilly-dally. Add about a 1/2 cup, stir until simmering, then add more. Add more milk for a thinner gravy, but know that you can always thicken it if you add too much."

The garlic, finely minced, will get a rich, toasted color and taste with a pinch of sharp garlicky spice, and the shallots will bring out a mouthwatering sweetness when browned.
