While you're waiting, you can set up your ironing board and lay out the article of clothing if you haven't already done so. You can tell the iron is ready by the subtle smell a hot iron makes. You can also wet your hand, splash a bit of water on the iron, and listen for a sizzle."

Use your other hand to flatten and guide the clothing item before the iron passes over it to avoid creating creases. Proceed in an even strip down the length of your garment.

For pants, work from the waistline to the leg. For shirts and dresses, work from the collar or bustline to the bottom.

Unplug the iron, and let it cool for at least ten minutes before putting it away. You can wet your hand and splash it again, or quickly touch the iron with the back of your hand to make sure it\u2019s cool enough to put away."
