      "headline":"Decide on what type of cutting you plan to do.",
      "description":"Cutting down large trees or large loads of firewood may require a bigger saw and more horsepower than occasional use for lopping branches. Consider buying an electric-powered saw (cord or battery)  if it will only be lightly used a few times a year, or if you plan to use it inside the woodshed. Know that there are chainsaws that mount to poles for reaching higher limbs, if that is part of your plans. Do you need your own saw? Compare the lifetime cost of buying and maintaining your own saw and safety equipment forever against the cost of occasionally hiring someone to do the cutting for you, with their own saws and safety equipment. Factor in your skill and confidence versus the safety of hiring a professional, when necessary, especially for rare jobs that may exceed the ability of your equipment and qualifications."

    {
      "headline":"Estimate what size you will most often be cutting.",
      "description":"The diameter of the material will determine the length of the guide bar and chain you need. If you typically only cut small branches or brush, it may be unnecessary to own a larger saw for occasional larger cutting jobs. The guide bar and chain length are also limited by the horsepower of the engine. The engine size is a major factor in how heavy the saw will be. Buy only what you will normally need. Most saws can accommodate different lengths of bars and chains, to a limit."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Figure out a price range.",
      "description":"Many times it may be more economical to borrow a chainsaw or rent one from a local supplier. Many second-hand chainsaws may have a lot of life left in them, especially if they have been professionally refurbished."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Talk to people at local shops (plural).",
      "description":"Many sales people will value their product above the competition's. Ask someone who has worked with the saw before. Study some of the massive amount of tutorials online, giving you a better understanding of the options from which you will need to select. If you can borrow or rent a saw, you may want to try that a few times to determine what best serves your particular needs. Buying an expensive saw does not necessarily make it easier or safer to use. Some shops have an outdoor area where they can demonstrate the saws and you may be allowed to try them briefly."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Get a saw (with extra bar and chain).",
      "description":"Know what you need and make an informed decision. Explain your needs to the salesperson and have them describe your options. Pick up and hold the saw before you buy it, gauging the weight and balance for your needs. Test the chain brake and other controls, under supervision of the salesperson. Buy only the saw you need now, not necessarily the biggest one you can afford. Understand what warranty, support, and return policy you are getting."
    },
    {
      "headline":"While you're there, having selected a particular saw, get the accessories.",
      "description":"These include protective equipment and basic operating and maintenance equipment. Safety:  Kevlar leg chaps (waist to instep), eye/ ear protection, helmet, leather or Kevlar gloves. Safety-toe boots are also highly recommended. Some owners also buy bar guards or carrying cases to increase safety during transport. Many small saws come with a carrying case. Operating:  two-stroke fuel-oil mix (premix or oil to add to gasoline), bar oil, combination screwdriver/wrench (\"scrench\"). Buy the proper mix for your saw. If you plan to do your own sharpening, you will need more tools. These include a tooth file, raker file, raker (depth) gauge. As  mentioned above, don't forget to buy one or more spare chains and bar that fit your saw. If you buy files, consider buying a file guide as well. Maintenance varies by saw, but you may need a torx or hex driver to remove covers, a spare air filter and fuel filter, specific spark plug, an extra drive sprocket and spare flange nuts for the bar cover. Read the manual that comes with the saw, even if you have never before read the manual for anything."

    {
      "headline":"Once you are trained and equipped, put on your safety gear and use your new saw with care.",
      "description":"Having read the manual, you understand the controls and how to add the required bar oil and the fuel mix, and adjusting the chain tension before you get started. Avoid using a chainsaw while alone. A sawing injury can be extremely serious."
