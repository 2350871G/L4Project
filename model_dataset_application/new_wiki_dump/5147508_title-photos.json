          "headline":"Use a descriptive adjective and accurate noun for a standard title.",
          "description":"To come up with an accurate title that adds a bit of color to an image, use a vibrant adjective with an accurate name for your subject. Accurately naming your subject will make it easy for your viewer to identify what they\u2019re looking at, and adding a strong descriptive word will make it easier to influence your viewer\u2019s feelings about the subject without being overbearing or wordy. For example, a photo of political protest could be titled, \u201cRevolting Crowd,\u201d or, \u201cPolitical Youth.\u201d\nAdd a little alliteration for an added layer of memorability. A photo of a cat pawing at the camera could be titled, \u201cCurious Cat,\u201d or, \u201cFascinated Feline.\u201d"
        },
        {
          "headline":"Add a layer of meaning with a conceptual or abstract title.",
          "description":"Add depth to a simple composition by giving it a deeper, complex title. Get creative and feel free to use multiple words in your title. If your image is striking but has a simple subject matter, add one of these titles to make the image more meaningful. A good example for a photo of a little girl looking at the sun may be, \u201cDreaming of Tomorrow,\u201d or, \u201cRhapsody in Light.\u201d\nDon\u2019t overdo it with the abstract nouns or you\u2019ll run the risk of not making any sense. For example, \u201cOverwhelming Freedom on the Wings of Justice\u201d is a little too wordy and abstract to really communicate anything."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Establish context in the title if it\u2019s missing in the photo.",
          "description":"In photography, context refers to the circumstances that led up to a photograph. Sometimes, like in a photo of a presidential speech, context can be rather obvious and you don\u2019t need to add it in the title. However, if it\u2019s unclear why, when, or how a photo was taken, include it in the title. This is especially important if some of this information is essential to understanding the image.Tip: Another example may be if you have a photo of a landscape and the setting is really important to understanding the landscape\u2019s importance. \u201cThe Fields of Gettysburg,\u201d for example, would let the viewer know that an important battle took place on an otherwise innocuous field in a photograph. For example, if you have a close-up photo of a woman crying, you could title the image, \u201cFuneral Procession\u201d or \u201cWedding Day.\u201d This will give the reader a clue as to why the subject is performing the action, and can radically change the meaning of a photo."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use a quote or song lyric if you\u2019re inspired by it.",
          "description":"A simple way to title an image is to think of a song or quote that you\u2019re reminded of. Look at your photo and ask yourself what the soundtrack for the image would be. Borrow a powerful quote or lyric to title a photograph if you can\u2019t come up with anything on your own. Cite the source for a quote if you publish a photograph with the intent of selling it or making money off of it. For example, if you had a photo of someone placing a religious candle at a memorial, you could reference the Beatles song by naming it, \u201cLet It Be.\u201d\nFor an ominous photo of a dark alley, you could reference Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s famous speech and title it, \u201cFear Itself\u201d"
        },
        {
          "headline":"Select a single, powerful word to add depth and mystery to an image.",
          "description":"Abstract nouns like, \u201cFaith,\u201d \u201cJoy,\u201d or \u201cWrath,\u201d can make strong titles for images that accurately convey a strong feeling or sense of mystery. Simple images that focus on a subject performing an action really work well. For example, a photo of a single person praying could be titled, \u201cSanctity,\u201dor a photo of a single protester raising their fist could be called, \u201cRevolution.\u201d \nDon\u2019t overuse this naming convention or you\u2019ll run the risk of appearing lazy and overly-sentimental."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Describe the subject accurately for a journalistic feel.",
          "description":"If the most important element of your image is the fact that it\u2019s documenting an important event, consider titling your image based on what is literally happening. Include the descriptions of the subject, the time, and the date in the title. Consider adding the setting to really give it a news-like quality. \u201dMan Walking a Dog in Dublin,\u201d and, \u201cWaterfall, New York State Park, 2001,\u201d are examples of accurate, journalistic titles."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Ask a question or use a short sentence to add narrative depth or irony.",
          "description":"If you want to communicate a story or poke a little fun at your subject, consider using a complete thought as your title. You can also use a short phrase in the title to give your subject an imagined piece of dialogue to make it seem like they\u2019re speaking to the viewer. For example, you could title a photo of a baby crying, \u201cAren\u2019t We All?\u201d to make the viewer interpret the baby\u2019s tears from a different, possibly ironic, level. A photo of a cat ignoring its owner could be called, \u201cWhy Don\u2019t You Love Me?\u201d or \u201cTalk to the Hand.\u201d"

Place the date at the very beginning of the file name so that the dates for multiple photos line up cleanly when you open a folder. If you don\u2019t know the specific date that a photo was taken, use an X to fill in unknown numbers or make an educated guess. The date that a photo was taken is stored in its metadata. You can access this information by using a metadata viewer, like Jeffrey\u2019s Image Metadata Viewer (http://exif.regex.info/exif.cgi). Organize folders on a computer by year and then use individual subfolders for each month in the year if you take images frequently. Add zeros to single digit numbers to make them easier to read in a column. For example, instead of writing 5-1-10, use 05-01-10. Set the date off in parentheses if you\u2019d like. You cannot use backslashes to separate numbers in a filename, so opt for hyphens."

          "headline":"Include the main subject or event being photographed.",
          "description":"After listing the date that an image was taken, include the subject or main event taking place in the photo. Keep descriptions to 2-3 words and try to use the same keywords for photos from the same event.Tip: Unless you\u2019re using a search function, it will be easier to scan a folder for a specific image by using open-ended descriptions. If you always plan on using a search function to find a photo, feel free to be as descriptive as you\u2019d like. For example, if you have a bunch of photos of a birthday party, use the tag \u201cbirthday party\u201d for all of them instead of naming them different, more specific names like \u201cblowing the candles\u201d or \u201copening gifts.\u201d"

This will make it easier for you to find sets of images that go together. An example of a subject tag at this point may be, \u201c(05-12-2010) Fancy Dinner Budapest,\u201d or, \u201c(xx-xx-1990) Jamie\u2019s Wedding California\u201d"

Put their last name at the end or beginning of the photo tag depending on how important the information will be in the future. If you only need it to remember who took a photo, put it at the end. If you may need to contact them later to discuss publication, put it at the front. For example, if you have a sequence of photographs taken by John Smith, start each label with \u201c(Smith)\u201d or \u201c(J. Smith).\u201d"
