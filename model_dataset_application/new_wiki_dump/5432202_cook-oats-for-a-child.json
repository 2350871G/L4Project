You can use your food processor to grind the oatmeal and puree and blend baby food from jars.

According to Dr. Alan Greene, a clinical professor of Pediatrics at Stanford School of Medicine, most babies will have good food habits when they eat natural foods, as they are usually less sweet and salty than processed foods. Minimize choking hazards for your baby by using a food processor. Solid food such as hard pieces of fruit and vegetables can lead to choking when given to babies, since most babies have not yet developed better eating skills and lack the ability to chew and swallow well. Make sure your pureed food is ready to swallow and moist so it does not require your baby to chew it. Use a blender or baby food grinder if you do not have a food processor. Just make sure that you really grind and cut the food into small pieces to avoid any choking hazards for your baby. Pour the oats in the food processor. Use about \u00bc cup of oats, since most babies usually consume small amounts of food at one time and you want to avoid wasting any of the oats. Run the food processor to grind the oats. Grind for fifteen to thirty seconds or until the oats are finely ground, forming a soft powder that looks easy for your baby to swallow. If you do not have access to a food processor or grinder, you can also buy powdered oats. Part 2: Cooking the Oats on a Stove Top Use a small stove pot or saucepan. The size of the pot should fit the amount of oats you are going to cook. Pour \u00be cup to one cup of water into the pot. Use this ratio: \u00bc cup of oats for one cup of water. You can also add milk for flavouring if you prefer. You can add \u00bd cup of milk and \u00bd cup of water or just add 1 cup of milk, depending on the desire consistency and taste.
