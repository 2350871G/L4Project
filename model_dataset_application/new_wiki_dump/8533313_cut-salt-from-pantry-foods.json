          "description":"Canned vegetables are generally high in sodium. To cut the salt from these, buy canned vegetables that say \u201cno salt added\u201d on the label. That ensures you are getting the vegetable without added salt. If you want a little bit of salt to taste, you can add a small amount of salt when you put the food on the plate. Consider cooking your vegetables with spices and herbs to eliminate the need for added salt. For example, try adding rosemary and thyme to green beans or ginger and sage to carrots."

If you can\u2019t find sodium free, you may find a reduced sodium option. Make sure to check the serving size. Reduced sodium varieties may not be low in sodium if the serving size is smaller than what you would eat."

          "description":"Many grain items may be full of sodium and other unhealthy additives, especially if you buy flavored varieties. Replace these sodium-heavy versions with plain, whole grains that are relatively salt free. For example, instant oatmeal not only contains added sodium, but sugar as well. Plain, steel cut oats are a healthier option. When buying cereal, look for brands that have whole grains as the first ingredient. Make sure to buy a brand with a low sodium content. Try whole grain pasta, brown rice, quinoa, buckwheat, and bulgur."

If available, get a reduced sodium, low-sodium, or no-sodium added variety. Condiments may include ketchup, mustard, dressing, olives, pickles, relish, dips, and soy sauce. Consider leaving the condiments off your food completely."

          "description":"Chips contain high levels of sodium. To cut salt from your pantry, find an alternative to potato and corn chips. Try finding a low-sodium cracker or try cucumbers and carrots for a crunchy snack instead. Look for a chip or cracker that contains less than 200 mg of sodium per serving. Some brands carry reduced sodium or no salt added chips. Read the label and decide if the sodium content is low enough to be a healthy swap. If you are basing the sodium content on the serving size, make sure to eat one serving. Measure it out. It is easy to go over the serving size and eat too much sodium."

Though you can get reduced sodium versions of many foods, they may still contain sodium. Consider buying fresh, whole foods instead of boxed, processed foods. For example, buy fresh vegetables instead of canned, or try no sodium added frozen ones. Make your own cakes, cookies, and other desserts from scratch. You can leave out the added salt when you bake them yourself. Make your own sauces. For example, pasta sauce can have a high salt content, but if you make your own from fresh tomatoes, you can eliminate the salt."
