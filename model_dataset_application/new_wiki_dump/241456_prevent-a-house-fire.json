          "headline":"Check the condition of your home's electrical system.",
          "description":"Wear rubber sandals and hold a wooden stick or equipment to avoid getting an electric shock. Remove any jewelry  or metallic accessories that you might be wearing to be safe as they might conduct electricity. Look for improperly grounded receptacles. Many modern appliances require a \"three pronged\" (grounded) receptacle, but people will sometimes use an adapter to bypass this safety feature, or even break a ground prong off an appliance cord. Changing existing circuits to provide grounding is a job that is best left to a professional electrician. Look in the attic and crawl spaces for wiring which has been damaged by pests or insects. Some old wiring is insulated with a material which insects eat or chew on, and squirrels or other rodents will often chew the thermoplastic insulation off of modern nonmetallic cable (Romex). Look for overloaded circuit breakers, panel boxes, or fuse boxes. Check for breakers or fuses which may have circuits \"piggy-backed\" on them. These are rated for single circuit protection, but sometimes in outdated or undersized panel boxes, people will put two or even more wires in the terminal of a single breaker or fuse. Notice flickering lights, or intermittent power surges. These conditions may be caused by outside influences, but if they occur often, they may indicate a bad connection or a short in the circuit. Note breakers which trip, or fuses that blow frequently. This is almost always a sign of an overloaded circuit or other wiring problem, usually of a most serious nature. Look at the individual breaker connections, especially in outdoor panel boxes, for corrosion, signs of thermal damage (smut or smokey residue near terminals) splices which are poorly taped or wire nutted, or abraded or damaged wire insulation. Check the ground cable. A failure in the building grounding system and bonding can be dangerous in regard to electrical shock, as well as fire. Look for loose split bolts, clamps, or other connecting devices, and corrosion. Be especially careful to notice any connections in wiring other than copper. Installed correctly, and with tight connections, aluminum wire is not excessively dangerous, but when connections are made to copper wires, an electrolytic reaction may occur, causing increased resistance in the connection which will generate excessive heat. If you are able to apply an antioxidant compound to aluminum connections, it will help decrease the risk of oxidation causing a short circuit at these locations."

          "headline":"Check the natural gas/LP gas system in your home.",
          "description":"You will want to look for loose fittings, leaking valves, faulty pilot lights, and debris or improperly stored flammable materials in areas near these appliances. Check the vent stacks on gas water heaters, furnaces, and clothes dryers. Check the automatic ignition systems or pilot lights on these fixtures, as well, particularly for any guards which are not properly installed, and for lint or dust buildup in the immediate area around them. Have the gas plumbing (pipes), valves, and regulators inspected by a professional any time you smell gas or suspect a leak. Do not switch anything on if you smell gas, as it could cause fire. You can switch off anything that's one with a wooden or plastic object or stick. Open all the windows and doors so all the gas goes out safely."

For window air conditioners, never use extension cords! Lubricate belt drive pulleys (where applicable), boss bearings on drive motors, and other equipment as needed. Have the resistance coils or furnace burners cleaned and serviced at the beginning of the heating season, since debris may accumulate there while the system is off during the summer. Listen to the system when it is operating. Squealing sounds, rumbling noises, or banging and tapping sounds may indicate loose parts or bearings which are seizing up. If you have access to a snap-on amp meter, you may check the amperage draw on the high amperage circuit to your heating coils to make sure they are in the normal operating range. Higher than normal amperage draw on a circuit indicates unusual resistance, and in an electrical circuit, resistance is what causes heat, and ultimately, fires."

  "text":" Checking the House Inspect your home. You may need to recruit, or even hire, someone experienced in home electrical wiring, plumbing (gas), heating, and air conditioning to ensure that it is thoroughly inspected. You can also do the checks outlined in the following steps. Check the condition of your home's electrical system. Wear rubber sandals and hold a wooden stick or equipment to avoid getting an electric shock.

If you are able to apply an antioxidant compound to aluminum connections, it will help decrease the risk of oxidation causing a short circuit at these locations. Check the natural gas/LP gas system in your home. You will want to look for loose fittings, leaking valves, faulty pilot lights, and debris or improperly stored flammable materials in areas near these appliances. Check the vent stacks on gas water heaters, furnaces, and clothes dryers. Check the automatic ignition systems or pilot lights on these fixtures, as well, particularly for any guards which are not properly installed, and for lint or dust buildup in the immediate area around them. Have the gas plumbing (pipes), valves, and regulators inspected by a professional any time you smell gas or suspect a leak. Do not switch anything on if you smell gas, as it could cause fire. You can switch off anything that's one with a wooden or plastic object or stick. Open all the windows and doors so all the gas goes out safely.

Always hire a credible engineer to fix any issues with your electrical products, especially air conditioners. Clean, or have your interior AC coils cleaned, and replace your return air filters regularly. This will prevent the fan motor from being overworked, and also save money on your energy bill. For window air conditioners, never use extension cords! Lubricate belt drive pulleys (where applicable), boss bearings on drive motors, and other equipment as needed. Have the resistance coils or furnace burners cleaned and serviced at the beginning of the heating season, since debris may accumulate there while the system is off during the summer. Listen to the system when it is operating. Squealing sounds, rumbling noises, or banging and tapping sounds may indicate loose parts or bearings which are seizing up. If you have access to a snap-on amp meter, you may check the amperage draw on the high amperage circuit to your heating coils to make sure they are in the normal operating range. Higher than normal amperage draw on a circuit indicates unusual resistance, and in an electrical circuit, resistance is what causes heat, and ultimately, fires. Checking and Safe Use of Household Items Check your appliances. Keep your stove and oven clean, especially watching for grease accumulation. Check stove vent hoods, clean the filter regularly, and make sure that if it is equipped with an exterior vent, insects or birds do not build nests or otherwise impede the air flow through it. Check the power cords for your appliances. Look for missing grounding prongs on the plugs and damaged insulation, and replace or repair them if defects are found.

As much as it blocks sound from your children and alarm systems, closing interior doors and exterior doors helps prevent the movement of smoke and heat should a fire occur and ensures that your room does not ignite. The door takes all the thermal damage on the opposite side. Remember, \"close before you doze\". Outdoor Safety Do not pile up la-wn clippings near a building. Fermenting lawn clippings can create heat, and catch on fire. Barn fires start this way from bales of hay with no electricity; house fires have been started from a pile of lawn clippings. Be careful using a grill on a deck. Decks are flammable. Place non-flammable pads under your grill. Have a fire extinguisher readily available. Stay with your grill while cooking. Turn off propane if leaving, if even for a minute. After all, you'll be right back and can turn on the propane again. Pet Safety Crate train dogs. Use the crates when you are not home and when you're not awake, to prevent new dogs or puppies from chewing on electrical cords. This will also prevent pets from urinating on electrical objects and starting a fire. Confine new cats to a safe room, a small room with no places for the cat to crawl into to hide (such as into the refrigerator motor), and no electrical cords. Use the safe room until the cat is calm and no longer hiding. Provide cats with edible oat or wheat grass, to prevent them from chewing on electrical cords. Confine rabbits, chinchillas, and other pets when not supervising them, to prevent them from chewing on electrical cords, causing burns or electrical fires. Release them in case of an unforeseen incident. Installing Fire Prevention Tools and Teaching Fire Safety Install and maintain smoke detectors. Rental properties in many countries must have smoke detectors. If you have them in your home, keep them in good working order and if you don't have any, get some, or ask your landlord to install some. Look into the possibility of installing a lightning protection system in your home if you live in an area where lightning is a frequent problem. The savings from reduced damages to appliances may offset the cost of this upgrade. Consider having a home sprinkler system installed. This can be used to extinguish fires both when you are away and at home. Teach your children not to play with lighters or matches. Children are often both the cause and victims of fires, and should not be allowed access to matches or cigarette lighters.
