  "text":" Mix your dough. In a large bowl, add cake flour, yeast, salt and mix together thoroughly. Add the dried herbs of your choice. You can use mixed herbs or basil, marjoram, rosemary or thyme. Add two teaspoons of garlic. This can either be dried garlic flakes or chopped garlic. Mix all these dry ingredients thoroughly.  Now add the warm water and mix it carefully. A dough arm on an electric mixer would work. It would even work to use one of the electric bread baking machines on the market. Mix until a firm dough ball is formed. Do not add another ingredient before you have mixed it at least for 3-5 minutes. If the result is too sticky, add some flour. If it is too dry and flaky, add water. When a firm dough ball is formed, leave it in a warm place, like a sunny windowsill and leave to double in size. Sprinkle some flour over to keep it from drying out and forming a crust. Keep covered with a clean cloth. When the dough is doubled, knead it down with a rolling motion, back to the original size.  Squeeze balls of dough through your hand and break it off by twisting into the desired number of griddle cakes.  Stretch and flatten it into flat ovals.  Lay it on a floured tray, waiting to be put on the grill.  Mix up a batch of basting with either real butter (best choice, cooking margarine or even oil - each will give a different texture.
