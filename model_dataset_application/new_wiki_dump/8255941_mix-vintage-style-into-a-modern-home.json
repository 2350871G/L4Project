A great way to blend vintage and modern styles while preserving your furniture is using vintage sheets as a cover. Toss a set of vintage sheets over your couch to blend some vintage style in your otherwise modern home. Keep in mind vintage sheets may be expensive. You may not want to potentially damage them by using them as a cover. If you'd rather not damage vintage sheets, go for modern sheets with a vintage pattern."

This can be a mixing of colors, cuts, or materials to produce a piece that is both vintage and modern. For example, retro furniture was often curved while modern styles make use of materials such as leather and wood. Look for curvy chairs with wooden legs or leather seats. If it's within your budget, you can have furniture remodeled to give it a vintage touch. You can, for example, add vintage upholstery to a modern couch."
