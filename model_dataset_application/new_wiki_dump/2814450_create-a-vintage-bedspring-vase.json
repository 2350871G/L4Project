The mattress can be any age or condition; the only requirement is that you're done using it as a mattress, as it will need to be completely disassembled. If you don\u2019t have access to an old mattress, you may be able to find bedsprings online or at flea markets, garage sales or antique shops. eBay and Craigslist are also great resources for hunting down old bedsprings."

Use medium sandpaper to rough up your bedspring slightly. If you plan to incorporate your bedspring vase into your garden, you can skip this step and leave your bedspring as is. Do not strip the outer layer of your bedspring entirely; just rough the spring up enough so that paint will be able to stick to the spring."

Select your color of choice, then spray paint your bedspring. Apply two coats of paint, allowing your spring to dry completely between coats. Spray paint your bedspring outside or in a well-ventilated area. Hold your spray paint can a few feet away from your bedspring and apply even pressure as you mist your bedspring. For a more neutral bedspring vase, paint your bedspring gold or black. For an added pop of color, paint your bedspring royal blue or hot pink."

If you don\u2019t have a test tube, you can also use a thin vase or glass bottle to accomplish the same thing. You can also swap your test tube out for a candle stick. Make two bedspring candlesticks and use them as centerpieces for your dining room table."
