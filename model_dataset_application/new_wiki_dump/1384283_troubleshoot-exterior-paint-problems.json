To fix peeling paint:\nRemove peeling paint by power washing, sanding or calling in a professional to use a torch. Repair any problem areas in the wood with vinyl spackling compound. Sand the exterior, particularly the speckled areas. Paint the patches with an oil-based sealer. Resume house painting with a quality paint."

      "description":"Make certain the exterior of the house and the area underneath the siding is dry before painting. Avoid painting in extreme heat, which is another cause of bubbling known as blistering. Blistering pops up when paint is too thin or the surface hasn't been prepped properly."

      "headline":"Know that rusty nail heads in the siding leads to rusty spots in your exterior paint.",
      "description":"This also comes from excess moisture. Replace rusty nails with rust resistant fasteners, such as ceramic coated construction screws or hot-dipped galvanized nails. When it's not possible to remove nails, sand the nail heads and apply a rust converter to them. Treat rust stains with a shellac-based primer-sealer that doesn't allow bleed through. Paint finishing coats over the sealer."

      "description":"Remove mildew with a diluted bleach solution made of 1 part bleach to 3 parts water. Let it sit for several minutes before wiping it away. Prepare and prime mildew-free surfaces. Use a quality latex acrylic for house painting, because it resists mildew more than other types of paint."
