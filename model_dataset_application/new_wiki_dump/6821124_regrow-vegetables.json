Regrowing Carrots, Radishes, Leeks, or Scallions Cut your vegetables. For carrots or radishes, measure 1 inch from the top of the vegetable down, and then cut it. For scallions or leeks, measure 3 inches from the roots up and cut. Fill a container with water and place the vegetable in.

When the carrot or radish grows roots, wait 1 more day before planting it in soil. When the scallion or leek has lots of roots and they are about 3 inches long, plant it. Wait for growth. You can't grow a carrot or radish/turnip etc. but you can regrow the greens for decorations, salads, or a beautiful houseplant. Regrowing Garlic Take a garlic clove that has sprouted, not sprouted, or has roots.  Fill a container with water and place the garlic clove in. In a few days the garlic should grow a green sprout; if not the garlic is not in healthy shape and you can always try again. One or two days after the garlic has sprouted in water, plant the garlic.

Take the yam and cut off the half that has the most buds/sprouts. Put in toothpicks at right angles so the vegetable suspends over water (half in water). Plant. Plant the ginger in soil but make sure that half the top part of ginger is visible. Plant the yam in soil up to the sprout but not covering any of them. Harvest your veggies.
