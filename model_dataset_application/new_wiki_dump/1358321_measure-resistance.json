In order to get an accurate reading of resistance you must set the multimeter to the proper range for your component. Some digital multimeters will automatically set the range for you, but others will need to be set manually. If you have a general idea of the range of resistance just set it to that range. If you\u2019re unsure, you can determine the range through trial and error. If you don\u2019t know the range, start with the middle range setting, usually 20 kilo-ohms (k\u03a9). Touch one lead to the end of your component and the other lead to the opposite end. The number on the screen will either be 0.00, OL, or the actual value of resistance. If the value is zero, the range is set too high and needs to be lowered. If the screen reads OL (overloaded) the range is set too low and needs to be increased to the next highest range. Test the component again with the new range setting. If the screen reads a specific number such as 58, that is the value of the resistor. Remember to take into account the range applied. On a digital multimeter the upper right-hand corner should remind you of your range setting. If it has a k\u03a9 in the corner, the actual resistance is 58 k\u03a9 (58,000 ohms). Once you get in the right range, try lowering the range one more time to see if you can get a more accurate reading. Use the lowest range setting for the most accurate resistance readings."
