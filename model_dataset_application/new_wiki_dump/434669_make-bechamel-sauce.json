Be sure to use exact measurements: 2 tablespoons butter, 4 1/2 tablespoons flour, and 3 cups milk. If you prefer a thicker sauce, scale back the milk by 1/2 cup. For a more liquid sauce, add 1/2 cup milk. Using full fat milk will result in a thicker sauce than using low fat or skim milk."

Remove the milk from heat when it is warm and cover. If you prefer, you can heat the milk in the microwave. Use a low setting and heat the milk for 1 minute. Check to see if it is heated; if not, place it back in the microwave and heat it for another minute. If the milk comes to a boil, it's best to start over with new milk, since this can affect the flavor."
