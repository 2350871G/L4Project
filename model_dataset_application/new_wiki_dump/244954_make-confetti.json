The amount of confetti that any of these materials makes will depend on the size and weight of the material you choose. For a simple way to make unique confetti, purchase origami paper that has designs or patterns printed on them. Consider the event where the confetti will be used to determine what color confetti to make. For example, if you're making confetti for a winter party, choose paper that's pale blue, white, or silver."

You can often purchase tissue paper that contains an assortment of complementary colors."

Since these are often sparkly and vary in size, you'll get truly unique confetti when you cut them.Tip: Ensure that you're using ribbon that doesn't have wire in it since this can make it difficult to cut or punch. Consider buying ribbons or garlands that vary in thickness. This will give you different sizes of confetti."

Once you've folded the material at least 3 times, use scissors to cut the material into \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) wide strips.Tip: Make uniquely shaped confetti by changing the angle of the scissors as you cut the strips into pieces. To make diced confetti, turn the strips 90-degrees and cut them again. You can make these diced cuts \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) in size."

For the best result, use sturdy paper, such as cardstock or construction paper, to punch the shapes or holes. After punching out the shapes, you can cut the leftover material to create more confetti and reduce waste. Look for specialized punches, such as hearts, flowers, birds, stars, baby rattles, and holiday shapes."

For the tiniest confetti, use a micro-cut shredder instead of a cross-cut shredder. Avoid running materials, such as ribbons or garland, through the shredder since these may snag. If you use heavier cardstock paper, the edges of the paper may tear or look ragged."
