When the cookies are ready, place them onto greased or parchment-lined baking sheets. You can use a pizza cutter to cut the cookies into squares or rectangles with straight edges. If you want squares, make them roughly two inches by two inches (5 cm by 5 cm). To make rectangles, cut the dough into cookies that are 2.5 inches by five inches (6.3 cm by 13 cm). Alternatively, you can also use a fluted pastry wheel to cut the graham crackers with rippled edges. For the most traditional graham crackers, use the pizza cutter or pastry wheel to cut the cookies into rectangles. Another option is to use cookie cutters to cut the dough into shapes of your choice."

Transfer the cookies to a wire rack and allow to cool to room temperature before serving or using for other treats. To store, line an air-tight container with parchment paper to help prevent breakage, and store the cookies for about a week."
