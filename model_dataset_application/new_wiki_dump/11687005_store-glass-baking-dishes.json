Check that the dimensions of the divider are short enough to fit in your cabinet and wide enough to safely hold several dishes. For instance, if your glass baking dishes are 3 in (7.6 cm) wide, make sure that the rungs on your tray divider are at least 3 in (7.6 cm) apart. If you have a lot of dishes on hand, opt for a horizontal divider. Horizontal tray dividers look and function similarly to dish racks. If you\u2019d like your dishes to be easily accessible, invest in a vertical divider instead. Vertical tray dividers resemble a tiered cake."
