Look up recipes for finger foods or see what you have on hand to make that would be utensil-free. Some finger food options include:\n\nChicken nuggets or tofu nuggets and sweet potato fries with their favorite dipping sauces. Chicken, beef, or tofu and veggie kabobs (skewers). Grilled cheese sandwiches with baby carrots and ranch dressing. You could even cut the sandwiches into fun shapes to help make them more interesting to kids."

Avoid offering something that includes too many different flavors or that might seem unusual to them. For example, you might enjoy spicy or vinegary pasta sauce, but a child might be put off by this. If you make spaghetti, stick with a simple tomato sauce with just 1 or 2 herbs added to it. Likewise, you might love Indian food, but a child who has never tried it before might not be as excited if you put a plate of chana masala and saag paneer in front of them."

Some ways you can do this include:\nUsing berries and whipped cream to make a face on a pancake. Creating a pizza face with pepperoni eyes, a black olive nose, and a sweet pepper strip mouth. Placing 2 meatballs on a plate of spaghetti for eyes and then using sauce to create a big smile."

Letting kids choose the condiments, meat, cheese, and veggies that you put on their sandwich, or even letting them make the sandwich themselves with your help. Serving tacos with an array of different items they can add to them as they like, such as seasoned ground beef or vegetarian crumbles, shredded cheese, shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, sour cream, guacamole, and salsa."

However, not all cooking tasks are suitable for younger kids. Make sure to set the kids to a task that will be safe and realistic for them to tackle. For example, you could involve younger kids in making tacos by having them rinse the lettuce in a colander, while an older child could chop the onions and tomatoes. Have kids help with measuring ingredients for cooking and baking by giving them measuring cups and spoons and having them place 1 ingredient into a small bowl at a time, then handing it to you to add to the recipe. Kids who are old enough to read could help by calling out ingredients to you from the recipe."

This is important for young kids as well as older kids. Make sure kids know to use a potholder to touch anything that might be hot. Err on the side of caution and do not let younger kids touch hot things in the kitchen. Teach them to be careful when chopping veggies. Show them how to hold a knife to protect their fingers, and don\u2019t let them do this until they are old enough to do so safely. Also, make sure that they keep their fingers clear of the mixer when it is switched on."

This will help to ensure that they do not start to associate the kitchen with drudgery. Cooking should feel like a fun activity for kids, not a punishment! For example, if the kids finish their tasks and you do not have anything that they can do for about 30 minutes, let them go play outside or in their room until you need their help again. If you want to keep kids occupied in the kitchen, but do not have a cooking task for them to do at the moment, have them set the table or organize your spice rack."
