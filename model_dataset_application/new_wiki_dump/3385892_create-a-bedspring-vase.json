Another option is plastic etc. just cut it into the desired size and super glue or solder another plastic rim around it. The edge or rim is needed so when you put the flowers in, the flowers won't fall out. If you want, you can remove it's rust, spray paint and primer it on a large work space. Do the same thing to the bed spring. Color it with any color as desired. Don't forget to let them dry. You can spray paint it multiple times with different colors so each spring is a different color."
