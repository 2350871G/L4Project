          "description":"Sugru works best when applied to ceramics, glass, metal, wood, rubber, and dry plastics. However, it will struggle to bond with polypropylene, polyethylene, Teflon, or other plastics that have an oily finish to them. If possible, make the surface as dry and powder-free as possible before applying the Sugru to achieve the strongest adhesion."

          "description":"This is room temperature in most climate-controlled spaces and will allow the Sugru to cure most efficiently (in about 24 hours). Note that for every 20 \u00b0F (\u22127 \u00b0C) reduction in temperature, the Sugru will take twice as long to cure. For example, if you use Sugru in a room that\u2019s around 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C), it will take 48 hours to cure."

Unopened Sugru placed in the freezer, on the other hand, can last up to 3 times longer than the use-by date on the packaging."

          "description":"Paint tends to flake over and crack when applied to Sugru, so you won\u2019t be able to paint over your Sugru to make it blend in with its surroundings. Instead, mix and match different colored Sugru in order to achieve your desired shade before applying it. For example, if you want to make your Sugru purple, simply mix equal portions of red and blue Sugru before applying it."

Then, roll the Sugru into thin pieces and lay them along the edges of the patch. Finally, wet your fingers and use them to smooth out the Sugru so that it \u201cblends\u201d into the surrounding fabric. Adding Sugru to the corners of an iron-on patch will help the patch stay in place for a longer period of time. For best results, use a color of Sugru that either matches or complements the color of the clothing article. For example, red Sugru would work well with either red or orange clothing, but not with bright green clothes.Warning: Using an iron can be very dangerous, as it generates a lot of heat. Do not use an iron on an unstable surface, such as a bed, and keep children away from it while it\u2019s in use."
