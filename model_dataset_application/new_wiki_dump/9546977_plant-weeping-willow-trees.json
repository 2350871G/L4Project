Willows need dry soil from time to time, so planting in an area with good drainage and that has loose soil will allow air and water to get through. You can test your soil for good drainage before you plant. Dig a hole that is 1 ft (0.30 m) square. Fill the hole with water and then let it drain completely. Once it drains, refill it again, and use a ruler to measure the water\u2019s depth. Measure again after 15 minutes to see how much water has drained, and then multiple that amount by 4 to see how much water would drain in 1 hour. If the hole drains at a rate of 1 in (2.5 cm) to 6 in (15 cm) per hour, you have good draining soil."
