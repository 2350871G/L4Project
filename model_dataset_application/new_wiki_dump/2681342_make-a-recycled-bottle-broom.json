  "text":" Cutting the Soda Bottles Slice the bottom off each soda bottle. Use the Exacto knife to complete this task. Cut thin strips along the bottom of the first bottle. Use the scissors to cut strips that are approximately 1/2 inch/1cm long. The thinner the strips, the better. Leave approximately 2 inches/5cm of bottle between the bottle neck and the strip top. Remove the bottom of the next soda bottle using the Exacto knife. Be sure you cut the bottle using the same measurements as you did the first bottle; the broom bottom must line up once it's assembled. Cut the same sized strips up the sides of the bottle, leaving enough room between the top strips and the bottle neck.  Slice the top off the second bottle. Use the Exacto knife to remove the very top portion of the bottle. Be careful not to cut too closely to the top strips, or else the bottle will fall apart. Slide the first bottle underneath the second bottle so they are joined as one. The first bottle neck should fit nicely through the cut hole you created in the second bottle. Slice the top off the third bottle. The top for your broom will be made from the third bottle. Cut the bottle using the Exacto knife two-thirds of the way up from the bottom of the bottle. Leave enough space to hold the other two bottles in place. Assembling the Broom Slide the cut bottle top from the third bottle over the two previously joined, shredded bottles. Be sure the bottle tops are aligned and check that the fit is snug. Pound one nail into the right side of the third bottle. The nail must penetrate through the third bottle plastic and also pierce the other two bottles. Tap the nail backing off to the side (to avoid having it stick out). Pound another nail into the left side of the third bottle. Space the nails evenly, leaving enough room in the middle to slide the stick or broom handle through the bottle opening. Slide the stick or broom handle through the opening of the bottle until a third of the handle is through. The handle mustn't go all the way through, as only the \u201cbroom\u201d area should show. Tap the third nail through the stick/broom handle to secure it in place. If any excess nail comes through the other end, tap the end sideways with the hammer to secure the back. Done. ",
