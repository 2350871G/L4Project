For the purposes of this project, you'll only be using one side of the ladder but nothing prevents you from turning both sides into wall-leaning shelves; simply do the same things to both sides.

As noted earlier, if the rungs are damaged, you'll need to decide which need fixing and/or replacing and which can be left alone. Making Shelf Platforms Take measurements of the length of the steps of the ladder. Do both length and a desired shelf width. These measurements will be used to make a shelf platform which you will mount on the steps. Cut a piece of plywood to the measurements taken.  Shape the platform from the plywood piece. Cut out any sections needed to help the shelf platform slide onto the rung with ease. As you can see here, special cuts were required at the back of the shelf platform. Nail each shelf platform for every step or rung of the ladder. You may wish to nail at an angle that will counteract the lean the ladder shelf will have when placed against the wall. You'll want the books, objects, etc., to stay in place and not slide off. Displaying the Ladder Shelves Prepare ladder shelves for display. This means staining or painting the ladder if necessary. It might also need final adjustments or a last sanding. If you're using a wooden ladder and you're going for a natural look, consider at least adding a clear coat of gloss to protect the wood. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/5d\\/Turn-a-Broken-Ladder-Into-Shelves-Step-7Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-459px-Turn-a-Broken-Ladder-Into-Shelves-Step-7Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/5d\\/Turn-a-Broken-Ladder-Into-Shelves-Step-7Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-759px-Turn-a-Broken-Ladder-Into-Shelves-Step-7Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":306,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":506.31868131868134,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Affix the ladder to the wall.
