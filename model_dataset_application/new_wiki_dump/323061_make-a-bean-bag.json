The fabric is usually a cotton polyester blend and can be found either prepackaged or on the bar at your local arts and crafts store. You can buy material that serves as both the front and back of the bean bag, or purchase different fabrics for the front and back. You will also need:\nSewing machine\nSewing thread which matches your design\nRuler\nPencil\nScissors and/or rotary blade\nDried beans, corn, or peas found in bags at your local grocery store"

          "description":"For each bean bag you will need two pieces of fabric, each 5 X 5 inches. It is best to measure the distance with a ruler, making marks with your pencil. Then cut both squares out with a pair of scissors or a rotary blade. If you use a rotary blade, make sure you are cutting on a safe surface like a cutting board."

          "headline":"Iron your fabric (optional).",
          "description":"If you wish to iron the fabric so that it is not wrinkled, place a tea towel overtop each piece of fabric. Plug in your iron, wait for it to heat up, and press gently against the tea towel. Do not let the iron sit on the towel too long. Keep it moving. Make sure you are ironing on a safe surface such as an ironing board. Keep the iron away from children."

          "description":"Take one of your pieces of fabric and lay it face up (design up). Then take your other piece of fabric and lay it face down, overtop of the other piece. Make sure the edges are flush with one another. You should not be able to see any of the front design of your fabric."
        },

          "headline":"Stitch your fabric together.",
          "description":"First, take a few sewing pins and stick them through the two pieces of fabric. This will hold them together as you are sewing them. Next, place one of the edges underneath the sewing needle of your sewing machine. You will want to sew a 1/2 inch inseam around the edges of your pieces of fabric. As you are sewing around the edge, hold the pieces of fabric tightly together with your hands. However, make sure to keep your fingers away from the needle. When you get to the corners you can either reposition your fabric 90 degrees and begin stitching again, or make a diagonal stitch before you begin stitching the next side. Stitch all the way around until you are about 3 inches away from where you started. Stop there, as you will use this \"pocket\" in later steps."

          "headline":"Invert your fabric and fill it up.",
          "description":"Take your thumb and pointer finger and place them inside the opening you left. Grab the farthest inside edge and pull the fabric through the hole. After you have gotten most of the fabric out of the hole, you can go back in with your fingers to poke the corners so that they are sharp and crisp. Slowly pour in either dried beans, corn, or peas. You can tilt the bag, grab some with your hands, or pour them through the funnel. You do not want to pack them tight. The beanbags are meant to be grabbed and handled, so it still needs to be slightly loose. Try to leave at least a 1/2 inch of fabric empty on the inside."

You need two pieces of fabric to form the top and bottom of your chair. Don't worry if you buy one continuous piece of fabric. All you have to do is cut it in half using scissors when you get it home so that you have two even squares. If the fabric is available directly off the bar, you can get it cut exactly the size you need. If however it is only available prepackaged, make sure you buy a piece of fabric that is larger than what you will need."

The diameter of your circles should be the desired width of your chair (as decided on earlier). If you need help drawing circles, please visit: How to Draw a Circle.

You will first make a 1/2 inch inseam around to stitch your circles together. Leave a hole at the end so that you can get your hand in between the circles. You will then go back in the opposite direction, this time sewing a 3/4 inch inseam. Once more, do not sew over the hole you will need to put your hand through. After you have stitched your circles together, remove them safely from the sewing machine. Take a pair of scissors and trim off the excess fabric, about 1/4 inch close to the 1/2 inch inseam."

Poke your hand back through the hole to push against the seams, and make sure the fabric is poked all the way out. Fill your beanbag chair with whatever you like. You can use standard stuffing material. You can use real beans. Polyester pellets are also a very popular item to use. All of these can be found at your local arts and crafts store.
