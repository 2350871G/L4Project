It's not as good a quality as solid wood, but solid, beautiful pieces can be made out of veneer. In fact, you can even sand and re-stain these pieces, though you don't want to sand too much, as you can wear through the veneer layer. Veneer actually doesn't split as much as hardwood. On the other hand, you may get blistering over time, or the veneer may start to peel up. When choosing veneer, look for a thin veneer layer rather than thick veneer. Thick veneer is more likely to split. You'll be able to to tell on the edges. Thick veneer will be visible."

If you know the type of wood the furniture is made out of, you know a bit more about it's quality. \"Hardwood\" and \"softwood\" more often refer to the type of tree than the durability of the wood, so pay attention to the type of wood instead. For instance, pine is cheap, so it's used fairly often. However, it's relatively soft, so it dents and dings easily. Oak is hard-wearing. It also has a distinctive, visible grain, so you need to appreciate the look. Walnut is also hard-wearing, but it has a variation in color that may or may not be to your taste. Cherry is a more expensive wood, due to its fine grain and beautiful color. Maple is not as expensive, but it is extremely durable. It is also easy to stain any color you'd like. Mahogany is more expensive than maple, and it is also a quality wood."
