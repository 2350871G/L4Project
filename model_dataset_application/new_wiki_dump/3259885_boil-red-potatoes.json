Grated Parmesan cheese can just be sprinkled on without any additional work. For shredded cheddar, mozzarella, or other similar cheeses, sprinkle the boiled and drained potatoes. Microwave the cheese-covered potatoes for 30 seconds to melt the cheese. If you want to toast the cheese lightly and give the edges of the potatoes a mildly crispy edge, transfer the boiled and cheese-covered potatoes to a greased baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius) on the top rack of the oven."

Experiment with different spices to add flavor to your potatoes. For instance, a quick way to add color and flavor to your boiled and drained red potatoes would be to sprinkle them with 1 tsp (5 ml) of paprika. Similarly, you can combine 1 tsp (5 ml) of paprika with 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of olive oil, whisking well until combined. Toss the cooked and drained potatoes in this mixture so that they benefit from the flavors of both the paprika and the oil."

If the potatoes are not already quartered, cut them into quarters. Place a serving size on a dish. Coat with butter and toss until covered. Cover with a sprinkle of shredded cheddar cheese, a dollop of sour cream, and a dash of chopped fresh chives or green onions. Consider sprinkling with bacon bits, as well."
