To remove excess water from greens, place the greens in the center of a large piece of cotton muslin (36' x 36'). Gather up the four corners and four edges of the muslin and grasp firmly. Go outside (or in a shower stall) and swing your arm around in a big circle. The water will spin away from this centrifuge action. Then while you prepare the rest of your meal you can open up the muslin and place the greens on a surface somewhere cool and dry, so the greens dry off even further. You can also use a salad spinner, but muslin is much easier to store and less expensive. Dry greens make the best salads -- the salad dressing is not diluted by rinse water, and the leaves are less prone to rot when the salad is stored."
