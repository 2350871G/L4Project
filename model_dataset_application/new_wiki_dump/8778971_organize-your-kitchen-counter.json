Store small appliances that don\u2019t fit in the cabinets or your spice rack that\u2019s only for fancy dinners on top of the fridge. The size of your fridge limits how easy it is to store things on top of it. For tall fridges, store things you only rarely need because you can pull a footstool up to it when necessary. Store items like soda or juices on top of the fridge so you can easily restock when you run out. If you are tall enough to reach, move your microwave to the top of the fridge to free up a big section of your counter."
