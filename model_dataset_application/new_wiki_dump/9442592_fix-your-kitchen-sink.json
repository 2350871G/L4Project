Many times you may even be able to unclog the drain by holding the nozzle close to the drain as you suck out the water.

This is one of several precautions you should take before you begin tearing apart your faucet to fix a leak. You don\u2019t want to lose anything down there during disassembly! Turn off the water to the faucet. There should be two shut-off valves beneath the sink, one each for hot and cold.

Before you tear out the old sink, clear out all the cleaning bottles, buckets, pots and pans, or whatever else is in the cabinet underneath. Place old towels over the bottom of the cabinet to sop up excess water. Turn off the hot and cold water lines by twisting the valves in the cabinet clockwise, then open the faucet to drain the lines.

Disconnect the hot and cold water lines. These are the flexible metal tubes that connect each shut-off valve to the underside of the faucet. To disconnect them, loosen the nut above each valve with a wrench. Disconnect the garbage disposal, if you\u2019re saving it. How the disposal is connected to the sink varies based on brand and type.

If your sink has a metal lip around its edge that keeps it in place, you have a top-mount. Run a utility knife around the perimeter to slice through the caulk.
