          "description":"Place your thumb just beneath the bolster of the handle. Wrap your index finger around the handle from the other side of the knife. Bend both fingers closer together until they meet. Note that the bolster is the blunt piece of metal in between the sharp portion of the blade and the handle of the knife. The handle grip is the option most beginner cooks naturally gravitate toward and it typically feels more natural than the blade grip. It also works well for cooks with unusually small hands. On the other hand, this grip style causes the wrist to fall out of alignment with the palm and fingers, thereby limiting the amount of control you have with the knife."

Many beginning cooks have the habit of extending the index finger over the blunt top edge of the knife while cutting. Doing so is ill-advised, however. The index finger alone does not provide enough force to help control the blade, and this finger can actually become sore while you chop if you hold it in this manner."

If desired, you can pinch the base of the blade with your thumb, index finger, and middle finger. Some cooks find this position easier to work with than one utilizing only the thumb and index finger. When using a knife with a notably thin blade, like a utility knife or a boning knife, it might be easier to pinch the base of the blade with your thumb and middle finger while resting the index finger over the blunt top of the blade.

Gripping the knife with too much force can cause tension to build in your hand. When that happens, your hand is more likely to tire out, and the accuracy, safety, and speed of your cuts will diminish as a result."

Due to the way the non-dominant hand looks, this is often referred to as the \u201cclaw\u201d cutting position. The food should be held in a stable position. Ideally, you should place it on the board with the flat side down. When there is no natural flat side, it is usually well-advised to begin by cutting off a portion or slice to create a flat space. That flat space should then remain face down on the board for the rest of the process."

Before you actually begin to cut, lightly press the top knuckles of your index and middle finger to the smooth, flat side of the blade. While cutting, gradually ease your entire hand back as you move the knife along the length of the food. Your knuckles should stay in contact with the blade the entire time."
