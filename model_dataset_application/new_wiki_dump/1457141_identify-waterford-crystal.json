Use a soft cloth or sponge to avoid scratching, which may occur with scouring pads. Rinse the crystal and allow it to air-dry. If you dry it with a cloth, be sure the cloth is lint-free. To clean vases or decanters or any other piece that you can't reach inside of, fill them halfway with warm-to-hot water and a few drops of dish soap. Add 2 tablespoons of white vinegar or ammonia. Then add 1 cup of uncooked rice. Swirl the mixture around to clean the inside of the piece. Rinse it out with warm-to-hot water and then set it upside-down to air-dry. For tougher stains, fill the piece all the way with warm water. Add a denture-cleaning tablet. Wait for the mixture to remove the residue. Rinse the crystal thoroughly and set it upside-down to air-dry."
