These are the types of items which usually make homes cluttered and leave little space for the things we do need. Once you\u2019re done with the initial keep-donate-trash sweep, make a second sweep through your keep items and think about the last time you used them and if you actually need them."

Certain types of donated items will do the most good if donated to particular organizations (old furniture to Goodwill, toys to the Salvation Army, clothes to refugee organizations, etc). Make sure that items you designate trash really are trash. Tattered clothing should not be donated but low-quality though functional and intact kitchen equipment could really help someone out."

Think about their function and locate them where they can be efficiently reached and used. Though items may share a similar function, they may need to be split up if one serves its purpose better elsewhere. For example, kitchen supplies should be kept in the area of the kitchen where they can be easily accessed when necessary. Items which are not used often can be stored up and out of the way, like infrequently used appliances (such as ice cream makers) or fancy or overly large dishes."

An example of such an item may be small towels, which may be necessary to both the bathroom and the kitchen."

With items organized efficiently, your home will have more space and look less cluttered. Small items in a \u2018junk\u2019 drawer can be sorted into labeled used Altoids tins, for example (to keep them from getting mixed up and wandering everywhere). Tension rods can be placed in a tupperware drawer to hold back and separate lids. Place metal sheets on the inside of cupboards so that you can use that space to store recipe clippings, instead of attaching them to your fridge. Organize necklaces on coat hooks, earrings in ice cube trays, and purses on hangers. Those plastic compartments, fishing or tool bins can be really handy for all kinds of miniatures like watches, fuses, cosmetic supplies, batteries, or accessories of many sorts. Put stock cooking ingredients (like sugar and flour) into tins or mason jars, to make them stackable and easier to store. Put spices into metal spice tins and store them on the side of your fridge.

This is especially important for crucial documents like tax papers, birth certificates, and other sensitive information which you may need to find in a hurry or do not want to get lost. Have a set system for your clothes. You will have to devise a system which works best for you, but be sure you have a clear way of organizing both clean and dirty clothes. Dirty clothes can be separated by color into different baskets. Clean clothes should be hung neatly when needed and otherwise stored in drawers or baskets. Take a cue from frequent fliers and roll your clothes when storing them in drawers to minimize wrinkles and maximize storage space."

Finding ways to use the extra space in your home will maximize your organizational options. A cubby space between a fridge and a wall could be home to a pull-out shelving unit for small items like cans and jars. An awkward spot in a hallway could be home to a small bookshelf and used for various items. The space under your bed can be used to store off-season bedding and large coats and sweaters (using boxes, bags, or roll-out storage). Think about vertical space. It's often a missed opportunity and can really give excellent solutions. That empty void between the clothes and the closet floor can be filled with shelves or hanging shoe, belt or tie racks. Many people purchase units that can hold tools, bikes,  anything up against the wall. Just don't but things to high up"
