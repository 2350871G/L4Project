Increase the humidity in your house and workplace by using a humidifier. The moisture in the air can help reduce static charge from building up. Having plants around the house or workplace can help increase humidity as well. You can create your own humidifier by simply boiling water on the stove. You can add spices like cinnamon or citrus rinds give off a nice scent while you humidify your house."
