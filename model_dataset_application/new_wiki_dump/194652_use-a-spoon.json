It is acceptable to break up pies, cakes, etc with your dessert spoon, only break off one dessert spoonful at a time. If you have a dessert fork, cut into the dessert with it, then place your fork on the edge of your plate and use the dessert spoon to convey the dessert to your mouth. Alternatively, break up the dessert with the dessert spoon, one bite at a time, then push the food with the fork into the spoon, and eat from the spoon; for this method, hold the dessert fork in the left hand and the spoon in the right. Use a dessert spoon, in a formal setting, without picking up the bowl or plate. Use a dessert spoon to measure to quantities in recipes. A dessert spoonful is abbreviated to dstspn and is two teaspoons (tsp), or 10 milliliters (mLs). Do not overload a dessert spoon.

      "headline":"Use a teaspoon.",
      "description":"Teaspoons, as the name suggests, became popular when tea was first introduced to England around 1660. Use a teaspoon to add sugar to tea or other beverages. If you remove the teaspoon from the sugar container, don't use it to stir your beverage! Even the greasiest of greasy-spoons will provide you with a clean teaspoon for stirring your drink. A respectable dining establishment will provide you with a teaspoon on the saucer of your teacup. Eat small portions of food in small dishes with a teaspoon. Yoghurt, ready-made puddings, pureed puddings and individually portioned desserts are commonly eaten with a teaspoon, especially those sold in containers you can eat from. Use a teaspoon to measure quantities in a recipe. The abbreviation for teaspoon is usually tsp. It's 5 mL. It can also be written as t., ts., or tspn. The abbreviation for teaspoon is never capitalized because capital 'T' is reserved for the much larger tablespoon (\"Tbsp. \", \"T.\", \"Tbls. \", or \"Tb.\") Don't clink the teaspoon on the cup or mug or stir excessively vigorously."

    {
      "headline":"Use a soup spoon.",
      "description":"A soup spoon will be the largest spoon on the table although the size difference may be barely discernable from the dessert spoon. Identify a soup spoon by its round bowl. Hold a soup spoon in your preferred hand. Hold the spoon by resting the end of the handle on your middle finger, put your thumb on top. Spoon the soup away from you then sip the soup from the side of the spoon, sip, don't slurp and don't put the whole soup spoon in your mouth. Put down your spoon between eating spoonfuls - when you're not using your soup spoon, rest it in the soup bowl, not on the dish underneath. When eating soup in a cup, rest the soup on the saucer."

      "headline":"Use a tablespoon.",
      "description":"Tablespoons are used to serve food. You may place them on the table for people to serve themselves food from communal dishes. You may have a more appropriate serving spoon, go ahead and use those if preferred. Stir large quantities of liquid with a tablespoon when cooking. Measure amounts for recipes with a tablespoon. The abbreviations for tablespoon are T, TB, Tbl, Tbsp. A tablespoon holds 14.787 millilitres. In most of the world, a tablespoon holds three teaspoons full of liquid. Do not use a tablespoon to eat or drink - unless you're pretending to have shrunk and you're stirring a very large cup of tea."
