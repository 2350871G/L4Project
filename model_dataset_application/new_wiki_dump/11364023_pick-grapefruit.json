However, the most common varieties look similar to oranges and have an orange-colored peel. As long as the peel looks consistent, you will probably end up with a ripe grapefruit. Don\u2019t choose a grapefruit with spots unless you\u2019re getting an oro blanco. Red and pink grapefruit are the easiest varieties to find in stores and usually look like big oranges. The peel may have a red tint to it sometimes. A white grapefruit looks more like a round lemon and has a bright yellow peel. An oro blanco grapefruit is a little different since it is a cross between a white grapefruit and another fruit called a pomelo. It is often green with yellow spots. The green color and spots don't mean the fruit isn\u2019t ripe!"

When these sides are flat, the grapefruit will have an oval shape instead of being perfectly round. The oval shape shows that it is ripe. Most people pick out round fruit, but try to find the ones that don\u2019t look perfect. The rounder ones usually were picked too soon."

Although the peel will feel smooth to the touch, you will be able to see a bunch of these small dimples all across it. Those dimples are one good sign of a healthy, ripe fruit.

If one surprises you with its weight, then it is likely very ripe. If a grapefruit looks small and feels light, then it probably didn't have enough time to ripen. Although underripe grapefruit is still edible, expect it to be bitterer than usual and have less juice."

Then, turn the grapefruit a few times to squeeze it in other spots. Make sure it feels firm all the way around. Soft spots or hidden wrinkles are signs that the grapefruit is spoiling. Soft spots can be from bacteria or even mold, so avoid any grapefruit that looks like it\u2019s starting to go bad."

In areas that experience cold summers, it may take up to a year to fully ripen. Ideally, plan on picking the fruit near the beginning of the season, around November, and then waiting longer if necessary.. Grapefruit grows best in warmer areas, such as the southern part of the U.S. You can leave ripe fruit on the tree until about March or even May. It will get sweeter over time. In colder regions, such as the southern parts of Australia, grapefruit may need to be picked early on in the season to prevent it from spoiling. Grapefruit picked early tastes bitterer and more acidic. To decide when to pick grapefruit, taste the fruit. If it isn\u2019t sweet enough for your liking, leave it alone. Many growers choose to pick grapefruit as late as April or May."

Wait for the fruit to change colors, then look for the ones that look big and heavy with juice. Select the ones that feel firm to the touch. Even if some grapefruit looks ripe, it doesn't mean all the fruit on the tree has finished ripening. To ensure they are all ripe, leave as many as you can until the end of the picking season.

Picking grapefruit doesn\u2019t require any special tools, but bring a ladder in case some of it is out of reach. Some grapefruit may fall off the tree before you pick it.
