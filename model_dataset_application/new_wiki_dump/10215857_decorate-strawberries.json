Do not wet the leaves as this can cause them to dry out and compromise the appearance of your strawberries. Let your strawberries air dry or dry them gently with a paper towel. Make sure your berries are completely dry before you dip them in chocolate. Otherwise the consistency and texture of your dip may be ruined."

          "description":"Dark, milk and white chocolate are all popular choices when it comes to decorating your strawberries using chocolate. You may like to use chocolate chips for melting, as these will melt more quickly than larger sections of chocolate. Dark chocolate has less sugar and fat than either milk or white chocolate. It is therefore a better option if you\u2019re wanting to keep your dessert as healthy as possible. It may be a good idea to temper your chocolate before dipping your strawberries - this will enable the chocolate to maintain a glossy texture and consistency when it dries at room temperature."

Use a slow cooker if you\u2019ll be melting a large amount of chocolate - this will keep the chocolate melted for long periods at a time."
