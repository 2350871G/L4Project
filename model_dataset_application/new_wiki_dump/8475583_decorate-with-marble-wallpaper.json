Avoid wallpapers that use dark colors if you want the room to appear larger. For example, you may want to add brightness to a dim hallway, or a room that is windowless and/or facing north. Try a pattern with subtle pastels, neutral colors, and/or a glossy finish."

Pick a small-scale pattern to make a room look more spacious. Small-scale patterns in light, cool colors visually expand the room. For instance, light shades of blue, green, purple, or cool gray. If you want the room to appear smaller, use a large-scale pattern in a warm, dark color. For example, dark shades of red, orange and yellow."
