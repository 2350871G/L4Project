          "description":"First things first, you need to donate to the Museum. To unlock the option to build the Museum Shop, you have to donate at least 20 things to the Museum, with at least one item from each of the four categories (art, fossils, fish, bugs.) Fossils can be dug up with a Shovel, fish can be caught with a fishing rod or by diving in the Island, and bugs can be caught all over town with a net. However, Art has to be bought from Crazy Redd. One day a week in your town, Crazy Redd\u2019s tent will appear in the town square, near your town tree. When you enter the tent, you\u2019ll see that he has 4 paintings or sculptures on display, and he\u2019ll inform you that your character can only buy one artwork for that day. Now examine what you wish to buy using A, and when you buy an item, you receive the artwork the following day. Choose carefully, though! Redd is known to forge artworks, and once you buy, you can't change your mind and switch to a different item. There are many guides on the Internet that tell you how to spot a fake from an original, so don\u2019t be afraid to look it up."

You\u2019ll then start a fundraiser in town, in which you can also donate some Bells to ensure that you get it built faster. To help raise funds to build the Museum Shop, go into your train station and give money to Lloid (the gyroid you can speak to). Then you can choose how much you want to give."

You also need to unlock them through donating a certain amount of corresponding items, but the items you donated to unlock the Museum Shop counts as well. For the Silver Net, you need to donate about 30 bugs. For the Silver Fishing Rod, you need to donate 30 fish. For the Silver Shovel, you need to donate 15 fossils. The Silver Nets and Fishing Rods have a wider radius for catching bugs and fish, while Silver Shovels have a chance of spawning Gems instead of Bells from a Money Rock."

To do so, you need to make enough \u201cgood\u201d Public Works Projects, plant enough Trees and Flowers without crowding the town, make sure to keep items scattered on the ground (excluding seashells, buried gyroids and fossils, mushrooms, and flowers) to a minimum, and pull weeds every single day. And you need to maintain this for 15 days. When you do this, talk to Isabelle in the Town Hall and she\u2019ll hand you the Gold Watering Can. The Gold Watering Can has an even wider radius than the Silver one, and can turn wilted Black Roses into Gold Roses when you water it. Proclaiming a Beautiful Town Ordinance as Mayor will keep the flowers from wilting and spawn less weeds, but costs 20000 Bells to enact, and only 1 Ordinance can be enacted at a time. Public Works Projects, like adding benches and fountains and streetlights, can increase the town rating, but \u201cugly\u201d projects\u2014like big screens, flashing lights, the drilling rig, and especially the  garbage\u2014can will decrease it. While you only need to plant a certain amount of trees (somewhere between 100-200 trees in total), you can have as many flowers as you want, as long as it\u2019s more than 50."
