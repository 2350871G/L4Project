Add the lactase enzymes to the milk and let it sit in the refrigerator for 24 hours to reduce its lactose content by up to 70%. Add 7 drops of lactase per pint of milk, unless the package instructions say otherwise. You can buy lactase enzymes in most pharmacies and vitamin shops. For best results when adding it to milk, buy the lactase enzymes in liquid drop form."

Take the tablets immediately before drinking milk to help your body break down the lactose and avoid the symptoms of lactose intolerance. Most people will only need to take 1-2 tablets before they drink milk. However, if you\u2019re not sure how many tablets you should take, refer to the dosing instructions on your supplements package. Although most people have no problems taking lactase tablets, they can cause an allergic reaction in some people. The symptoms of this type of reaction include hives, difficulty breathing, and a tightness in your chest. Not enough research has been done on the effects of taking lactase to know what effect it has on pregnant and breastfeeding women. If you\u2019re pregnant, avoid taking lactase tablets just to be on the safe side."

Take 1 dose every day of a commercial probiotic that helps break down lactose in order to reduce your symptoms of lactose intolerance over time. Most probiotic supplements that aid in the digestion of lactose will include this information on the front label. However, the best specific bacteria strains to have in your probiotic are Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus Rosell-11, and Lactobacillus acidophilus Rosell-52."

If your lactose intolerance isn\u2019t very severe, give chocolate milk a try to see if you have any trouble tolerating it. There are a few different ideas as to why chocolate milk produces less symptoms of lactose intolerance. Some scientists argue cocoa may stimulate lactase activity in the body, while others think it might reduce the number of gas-producing bacteria in the colon. Not everybody will be able to tolerate chocolate milk equally well. Try it in small amounts at first to see if your body reacts to it before gulping down a tall glass."
