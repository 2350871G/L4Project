The tough outer leaves will start to flake off. Remove any leaves that are bruised, dried-out, or tough. Stop when you reach fresh, tender leaves. Since they're spherical, sprouts are prone to rolling off the cutting board and onto the floor. Keep them in a bowl unless you're actively trimming the end to prevent them from falling."
