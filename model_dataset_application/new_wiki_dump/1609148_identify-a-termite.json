If possible, trap one of the bugs in question for examination and look at it under a magnifying glass or something similar. You can pick up a termite by gently clasping it between your thumb and forefinger. Place the termite in something like a mason jar to examine it. You can still examine a dead termite, but it may be easier to observe a live one. Pick up the bug carefully to avoid killing it."

One way to tell you're dealing with a termite and not an ant is to carefully examine the bug's wings and antennae. Termites have 4 wings. All 4 wings are the same size as a termite's body, while ants' wings are different sizes. Note that termites lose their wings after swarming, so the termite you\u2019re looking at may not have any. Termites have 2 straight antennae. Ants' antennae are somewhat curved."

If you see different types of bugs around your house, you may be looking at different types of termites. Winged termites are dark brown or black. These are the termites you are likely to see and inspect. Worker termites do not have wings, but still have the same antennae. They are white in appearance and sometimes translucent. Soldier termites do not have wings and are brownish in colors. They have pincers near their heads, as well as antennae."
