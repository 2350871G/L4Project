  "text":" Using a Bottle Opener Hold the beer bottle and the bottle opener in opposite hands. Grip the beer bottle by the base of the bottle. Hold the bottle opener by the handle so the flat end with the cut-out section in the middle is exposed. It may be easiest for you to hold the bottle opener with your dominant hand. Wedge the sharp edge of the opener under the side of the bottle cap. Look at the cut-out section on the flat end of the bottle opener. The edge of the cut-out section closest to the handle is the edge you want to wedge under the bottle cap. After you wedge the sharp edge of the bottle opener under the bottle cap, the opposite edge of the cutout section should be resting on the top of the bottle cap. Lift the handle of the bottle opener up with your dominant hand. As you lift the handle up, the far edge of the cut-out section of the bottle opener will press down on top of the bottle cap. At the same time, the sharp edge of the bottle opener will lift up the side of the cap, causing the cap to bend upward and pop off of the bottle. Discard or recycle the bottle cap. Once the bottle cap is off the beer bottle, you can set the bottle opener aside and enjoy your beer! Opening a Bottle with a Key Hold a key in your dominant hand and the bottle in your other hand. Hold the key so the long blade portion of the key is exposed. Grip the beer bottle by the base. Don't have a key? Use a metal utensil like a butter knife or spoon instead.

Twist the outward-facing edge of the key down with your dominant hand. As you twist the outward-facing edge of the key down, the edge that's wedged under the bottle cap will push up on the bottle cap.

Continue lifting sections of the bottle cap up with the key until the bottle cap pops off. Discard or recycle the bottle cap once it comes off. Using a Countertop Hold the beer bottle so the cap is resting on the edge of a countertop. Grip the beer bottle firmly by the base and hold it steady against the edge of the counter. To see if you\u2019re holding the bottle correctly, slightly loosen your grip on the bottle. You should be able to feel the bottle hanging off the edge of the countertop by the cap. Retighten your grip. Some countertops may get chipped or scratched if you try to open a beer bottle on them. Raise your free hand up above your head.

Keep trying until the cap comes off the beer bottle. You may need to hit the cap several times for it to pop off. If the cap doesn't come off after several attempts, double check that you're holding the bottle correctly. Make sure the cap is resting on the lip of the countertop before you hit it with your hand. Opening a Bottle with a Lighter Use a cheap lighter. The lighter you use to open the beer bottle may get scratched and chipped. Use a lighter you won't mind getting damaged.

Wedge the bottom corner of the lighter under the side of the bottle cap. Move your index finger and thumb to make room for the lighter, without loosening your grip. The body of the lighter should be pointing upward at about a 120-degree angle from the top of the bottle cap. Press the top end of the lighter down with your hand. Maintain a firm grip on the neck of the beer bottle with your other hand. As you\u2019re pressing down on the top end of the lighter, the bottom end will start to lift up, bringing the side of the bottle cap up with it. Keep pressing down on the top end of the lighter until the cap pops off. If you\u2019ve lifted the side of the bottle cap but the cap doesn\u2019t pop off, use your fingers to gently help the cap off the bottle. Discard or recycle the cap.",
