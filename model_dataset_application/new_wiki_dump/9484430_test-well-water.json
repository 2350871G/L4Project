You should test for inorganics, such as arsenic, pH level, copper, iron, lead, zinc, selenium, sodium, silver, manganese, barium, cadmium, chloride, fluoride, and hardness, every 2 years, though some recommendations say 3 to 5 years.

You should also test the water more often if you have had bacteria in the past. If the water has been contaminated this way before, it may become contaminated again. Aim for quarterly.
