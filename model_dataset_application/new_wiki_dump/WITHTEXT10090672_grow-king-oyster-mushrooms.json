Place the cardboard pieces in a sanitized 5 US gal (19 L) bucket. Cardboard egg cartons would also work well for growing the mushrooms. You can sanitize your bucket with a diluted bleach solution."

This helps kill any organisms that may contaminate your mushrooms later on. Push the cardboard down to compact it if you want to use less water.
