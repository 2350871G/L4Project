          "description":"Put your left hand out as though you were holding a cup of water, with your thumb nearest you. Place the deck of cards in between your thumb and index finger, keeping it flat with the face side down. Place your index and middle finger against the underside of the deck. The tip of your middle finger should be against the near right corner of the deck, with your index finger alongside it. Loosely hold the deck by placing your thumb across the top of the deck, with the tip about halfway across the nearest edge. Being left-handed or right-handed doesn't make too much of a difference, but you can try using your right hand instead if you keep dropping the cards."

          "description":"Shift the top of the deck slightly, so the top cards are very slightly more to the right than the cards beneath them. This small angle helps the cards fan out more evenly, although this step becomes less important with practice."

          "description":"Bring your right thumb onto the left edge of the deck, and use it to push the cards into a fan shape, pivoting around your left thumb. Press down slightly with your thumb as you do this, but keep it gentle enough that the cards spread out in an even fan instead of clumping together in chunks. Ideally, you should finish the fan with the cards spread out in a full 180\u00ba semicircle. You can use your right fingers instead of your thumb. You can think of this movement as pulling the stack of cards away from the bottom-most card in turn. If the entire deck moves together, hold it more loosely, or try consciously moving your right thumb at an upward angle as you spread"

          "description":"Magicians make fanning cards look easy, but they've put in many hours of practice. Keep practicing until you can fan the cards smoothly and evenly. Speed up your fan as you become more experienced, but don't become so fast that you ruin the grace and fluidity of the fan. Replace your deck if the cards become more difficult to fan. Worn cards may not spread as evenly."

For a more advanced technique, practice using the fingers holding the cards to pull them closed instead. You may need to \"walk\" your fingers a few times along the underside of the cards to manage this, and it can take a fair amount of practice before you can do this confidently and without dropping cards."

Practicing with half a deck is recommended. This fan is more difficult than the two-handed fan, and some familiarity with that method may be useful.

Put your third and fourth fingers along one short edge, and your thumb on the remaining short edge. Each finger should cover the entire width of the deck and protrude slightly beyond it. Turn your hand so the deck is held vertically, with the thumb along the upper edge. This grip should be secure enough that you can lift your thumb and rotate the deck in any direction without spilling cards. You can skip straight to the position described below, with your thumb in the lower left corner.

Once your thumb is in position, move your first and fifth fingers away from the sides and down to the lower edge, so all four finger are supporting the deck from below. This can take a little practice to time the movement of your first finger, so as not to drop the cards. Depending on the length of your thumb, you may prefer to place your thumb along the left edge of the top card instead, less than an inch (2.5 cm) from the lower corner. Placing your thumb nearer the center of the top card is a common mistake, so concentrate. If you are holding the deck in your left hand, instead place the thumb against the lower right corner."

(Reverse these directions for a deck in your left hand.) A fast spread will make the cards fan more smoothly. You can think of this motion as \"snapping\" all four fingers against your thumb. At the end of the fan, the fleshy part of your hand beneath your thumb will help support the fanned-out cards."

Hold the card fan vertically, directly in front of the audience member's face. This will distract him while your other hand performs an manipulations necessary with the other half of the deck."
