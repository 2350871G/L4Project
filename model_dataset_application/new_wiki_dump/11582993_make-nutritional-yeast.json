Most active dry yeast packets contain about 7 grams each, so if you want to make 1/4 cup of nutritional yeast, pour 6 or 7 packets of active instant yeast into a measuring cup until you have a full 1/4 cup (32 grams).

It could take anywhere from 2 to 5 minutes to deactivate the yeast. The yeast is done when each granule has turned a medium golden brown color."

Not all brands are fortified with B12, so be sure to check the label.

Nutritional yeast tastes great with roasted carrots, potatoes, greens, squash, broccoli, cauliflower, and just about any other veggie! You can sprinkle nutritional yeast on raw vegetables too, but the flakes might not stick to them as well."

This works especially well for dairy-free or vegan versions of caesar or cobb salads. If you\u2019ve overdressed your salad and don\u2019t have any more greens to disperse the dressing, adding some nutritional yeast can help soak up some of the moisture. Just note that it may create a powdery texture."

Microwave the mixture for about 1 minute and then whisk it again before using it. Sprinkle in some onion powder, rosemary, thyme, or other spices and herbs to suit your tastes. Add spinach, broccoli, artichoke hearts, black beans, or any other extras you like in your dips.
