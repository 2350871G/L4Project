Star rankings are determined by a number of factors as you complete the four races in each cup. Basically, race as fast and as cleanly as possible and you shouldn't have much difficulty getting a single Star, but keep the following in mind:\nAvoid hitting walls and obstacles (you can hit a couple per race and still get one Star). Avoid going off-road. Don't fall off the track. Falling off twice during a cup will essentially guarantee no Stars. Stay in 1st place as much as possible. Avoid using items to catch up. Get at least 50 points by the end of the Cup."
