      "description":"Think about what kind of friends you have. For example, if you happen to have a friend who likes to take risks, and if very athletic, they are more likely to hide in places where others cannot get to; such as, high trees, or on a roof. Or if you have a younger friend that is scared of the dark, they are more likely to follow one of the other hiders and give away their spot by being loud. Figure out what you, and your friends are like as this will help you whether you are the hider or the seeker."

      "headline":"Very carefully, look around your back yard, or wherever you're playing.",

      "description":"Most people get caught when they are running to find a new hiding spot! If you have a good hiding spot do not move! This may get boring, but at least you'll be the winner, and not have to be seeker next. (Unless it is an absolute must like the seeker is about to find you.)"

      "description":"Make sure you blend in with all of your surroundings. If you are playing in the dark, be sure to wear black, dark blue, or dark purple. Weather conditions may change, as in winter, summer, fall, etc. Make sure you change with the season to be absolutely camouflage. (Night: Black clothes, Snowy: White clothes, etc.)"

Maybe it is because it is your lack of secrecy. Maybe it is winter outside, and you forgot about the snow on the ground and you left footprints leading to your hiding spot! Or maybe you had some loose change in your pocket that had led a trail right to your hiding spot. Make sure you carefully get to your hiding spot, with no one looking, and no evidence left behind."

If you don't, it will make loud sounds, and the light from it will be showing through your pocket. Day or Night this will not do you any good. Try your best to leave all electronics, noisy items (keys, coins, etc.) and anything else that can give you away, inside of your house unless you completely must bring them."

The best way to get these people to stop talking to you is to simply ignore them until the end of the game. If that does not work, try simply saying \"I can't hear you. Tell me after the game.\" That shows them that you really don't care (in a nice way) and to just be quiet!"

      "description":"Keep your hiding spots a secret! Look for some good hiding spots and write them down. But make sure no one in the game finds your list of hiding and spots and never tell anyone your spots. But you might say \"she/he is my best friend and will never tell anyone else.\" Yes, that may be true, but in the game of hide and seek, its one man on his own. If you tell your friend your best hiding spot, and they become the seeker, they will know right where to find you! So, lock your lips and throw away the key!"

      "headline":"Never go to the same hiding spot in the same game!",
      "description":"Once you or a fellow teammate has been in a spot many times, it will become one of many of the first places a seeker will look. That's why you should have many Spots to choose from (that are different). You should also think about going to a spot in one game, don't go to it again for a couple more rounds, and then use it again. Most seekers forget places after a while."

    {
      "headline":"Always Have a Back-up plan (or a plan-B)!",
      "description":"Remember to never move spots (unless it is a must) Well, Plan-B is where the must part comes in. Somewhere in the game, someone will give away your spot (to either try to be funny, or to get back at you for something you did earlier in the game) It's just like if your house where on fire; you would have a back up plan to get out of wherever you are!"

At some point in the game you might have to turn on them to save yourself from the seeker. Make sure you don't do anything to tick your friends off; they can be useful sometimes! But also remind your self that you are playing to win - not to be Mr. Nice Guy!"
