Larger tips generally require more pressure, but can cover more ground effectively. Narrower tips, on the other hand, are best for precision work. If you're unsure about the sort of tip you should be using, contact a hardware professional and give her the details of your project."

          "description":"Latex paint works for airless sprayers, but it must first be thinned out in order to flow easily through the nozzle. Add 1/4 cup of water or chemical thinner for every gallon of paint you're using, then mix the two together thoroughly. You may have to experiment with different thicknesses of paint. Load some into your paint sprayer and check the coverage. If it's not spraying evenly, you may need to add more thinner. Latex paint is the default paint for airless sprayers. Chemical thinners are available from paint and hardware stores as well. These work more effectively than water and don't work against the paint's default properties. The type of paint you use for your project will depend on the surface."

Luckily, this is a fairly straightforward operation, as many airless sprayers will have a \"Prime\" setting. If your airless sprayer isn't priming successfully, it may help to give the device a slight tap with a hammer. This can loosen any clogged paint inside the sprayer. Keep the nozzle face downward in a bucket to account for paint drips while you're getting the sprayer ready."
