          "description":"All plants have certain climates they prefer. Although magnolia trees tend to prefer temperate environments, they're quite adaptable. However, the potential for harsh weather conditions can make it trickier to make the tree thrive. \"Plant hardiness\" charts are available to refer to in this instance. They can offer a general indication of how appropriate your climate is for growing. Some of the bigger magnolia trees will grow between 40-70 feet tall. Certain magnolia trees are better suited to certain climates. Although magnolia trees are usually perfect for temperate weather, certain species like the Southern magnolia will suffer if the temperature drops below -5\u00b0C (23\u00b0F). This temperature issue can be lessened by planting the tree in an area where it won't get as much wind. You should keep the time of year in mind as well. Magnolia trees are best planted in the early spring. This will allow the trees to make the most of the seasonal changes in its first year of life. The damages of harsh weather can be minimized by growing your tree somewhere where there is wind protection. Growing your tree in an enclosed area (like fenced housing) will help protect your tree during the most vulnerable years."

          "description":"Magnolia trees favour getting full sun, but they can suffice with light shade as well. However, if you live in a particularly dry climate, it may actually benefit the tree to have a bit of moisture-saving shade. Generally speaking, you'll want to find a place that gets at least some sun every day. The spot should also have enough room for a tree to grow to its full height naturally. This means keeping it away from potential obstructions, such as housing or low-hanging power lines. If you know your magnolia tree grows big (such as the Southern magnolia), do not grow it within six feet of a sidewalk or concrete foundation. These larger magnolias will break through the concrete with their roots several years from now. Because growing a magnolia tree is a long-term effort, it's important to choose a spot where you'll have access for a number of years. This includes properties you own (as opposed to rent) and community gardens."

While none of this will be an issue if your area's climate is temperate and rainy enough, you can purchase high-fertility soil from a gardening store if there's a problem with your land. You can test your soil using a storebought kit. Humus is a highly fertile soil matter, developed from disintegrated plant matter on the ground."

          "description":"Although magnolia seeds may be purchased from a store or ordered online, the seeds can be also be gathered around magnolia trees. Some experts advise attracting them from the source because the seeds are no longer viable once they dry out. Go to magnolia trees in September and October and look around the tree for seed pods to use in the spring. Alternatively, you may be able to find vendors who have gathered seeds locally and are willing to sell them. Here are some of the most common types of magnolia to consider:\nThe Southern magnolia is a large tree that benefits from warm weather. It's one of the largest magnolia species and grows up to 80 feet. The star magnolia grows to 15 feet and produces white flowers in the late winter. It is suited for colder environments. The Sweet Bay grows up to 50 feet and offers fragrant, white flowers and green leaves. If you're gathering seeds from a hybrid tree, the seeds won't necessarily grow to look exactly like the parent tree. You won't be able to tell exactly what kind of tree your seeds are growing into until they take bloom years later."

Following that, you should also scarify the seeds by lightly scrubbing them with sandpaper or steel wool. This will make it easier for the seeds to take root when it comes time to plant them.

Keep the bag safe until the early spring when it comes time to plant them. Keeping the seeds in a refrigerator or outdoors will help ensure they don't dry out. Putting the seeds in water first helps to soften them for storing."

Apply some dirt over the seeds and allow them some time to take bloom. Alternatively, you can plant your seeds in a pot, and transplant the seedling into the yard once it takes form. This can be done by digging out an area, then digging out the seedling (including all of the roots through the soil) and placing it in the hole. Trees take a very long time to grow, so don't expect fast results. Magnolia trees take about ten years to bloom flowers from their initial seeding."

Following that, try to see that it gets water at least once a week. Magnolia trees tend to be fairly resilient, and you won't need to do much to maintain them if there's sufficient rain throughout the growing season. The amount you should water your seedling will depend on the heat of your climate. Naturally, more water should be administered in hotter climates.

Treat this issue by simply removing any infected leaves and raking up any fallen infected leaves. Cankers disease, which can warp and destroy branches. If you notice a branch impacted by cankers, it needs to be removed immediately. Proper fertilization and watering can help prevent future complications.

Cut 6-8 inches from a growing magnolia branch with a sterilized pruner, and place the branch in water to sustain it. Place the cuttings in planters with potting soil and trap them in plastic bags to keep in the humidity. The cuttings may begin to root over the next few months. Cuttings are not always likely to take root. A large percentage of attempted cuttings fail. However, you can maximize your success by dipping the planted stem in a hormone growth solution, purchased from a garden supply store. This process is much faster than using seeds, as you'll probably get flowers after 2 years as opposed to 10 with a seed."
