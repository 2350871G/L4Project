Tear the fabric into 1\u201d (2.5cm) strips. Rather than cutting with scissors, this can be achieved just by tearing the shirt into strips (especially if the shirt is old and worn), beginning at the seam. Not only is tearing a quicker method, it allows you to create a rugged look with less loose threads.

You can use the T-shirt yarn to either make a lock or hook pattern by threading the T-shirt yarn through pre-patterned strips to create the dish towel, or you can knit one. A lock and hook dishcloth won't be as flexible as a knitted dishcloth though. Another idea for using the yarn could be to embellish existing dish towels with fabric designs using the T-shirt strips. Create patchwork designs or even crochet a small design to apply to existing dishtowels to enhance their appearance."
