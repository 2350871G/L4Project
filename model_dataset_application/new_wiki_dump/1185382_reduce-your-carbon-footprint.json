Switching to energy-efficient light bulbs will also significantly reduce your electricity costs. Incandescent bulbs will last for an average of 1,000 hours compared to LEDs at 25,000 hours. Some fluorescent (CFL) bulbs contain mercury. When you are buying fluorescent bulbs, look for ones with a label that says low-mercury."

Look for an Energy Star label on any appliance you consider buying. Energy Star is a certification given to appliance companies by the United States government. It signifies that the appliance is highly energy efficient. Regardless of how energy efficient your appliance might be, however, it is always good to unplug your appliances when you are not using them. If you have a hard time remembering to unplug your electronics, consider buying a power strip. You can plug your electronics into it, and shut them all off just by hitting the 'off' button on the power strip."

Shop at farmer's markets and natural food stores that carry products by local growers. You should also make a point of only buying products that are in season.

You don't have to stop eating beef entirely, but consider saving it for special occasions.
