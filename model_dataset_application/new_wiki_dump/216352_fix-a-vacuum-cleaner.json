Turn your vacuum upside down and turn it on to see if the roller spins or not. Then look through the hoses and nozzles to see if they are obstructed. Look at the filter to see if it\u2019s full or covered in dirt and dust. Check the attachments on the end of your vacuum hose as well to see if anything is clogging them while you\u2019re trying to use it."
