The services available differ between companies. However, most companies offer both short-term and long-term rental options.

Choose a larger dumpster if you have a lot of stuff to throw away or are getting rid of big objects, such as mattresses. If you are getting a dumpster for a business, use the size of the business to estimate how much trash you need to dispose of weekly. A person throws away about 4 lb (1.8 kg) of trash a day. A dumpster 6 ft (1.8 m) long and 3 ft (0.91 m) high can handle about 25 employees. Review the service\u2019s list of accepted waste products.

Front load dumpsters for businesses are about 6 ft (1.8 m) long and range from 3 to 7 ft (0.91 to 2.13 m) high. If the dumpsters are too big, try a waste bag.
