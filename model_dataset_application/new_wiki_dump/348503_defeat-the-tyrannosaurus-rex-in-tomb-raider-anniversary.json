When the glowing white arrows appear, press the required keys W/S/A/D (I have only played on PC, but the rule goes for all gaming systems) depending on where the arrow is pointing."

      "description":"If you have time, move to stand in front of a spiked bar. Once the screen turns blurry, use the Adrenaline Dodge (going either left or right) while locked on the Tyrannosaur. The moment it strikes red, shoot at him. The Tyrannosaur will fumble, and ram into the spiked bar (if Lara is standing in front of one) causing extreme damage to the Tyrannosaur. You can also defeat the Tyrannosaur without the use of the spiked bars in case you can't get to one in time; however, it takes longer time to defeat the Tyrannosaur."
