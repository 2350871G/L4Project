          "description":"Of course, you will be sleeping in your bedroom, but you probably use it for other activities as well. You may want to plan for a space to do homework or crafts, choose a spot for playing video games or watching television, designate an area for practicing a musical instrument, or set aside a space for doing your hair or makeup. If you have a ton of activities and interests, try to make spaces for just a few of your favorites. This will help prevent the activity or hobby spaces from becoming overwhelming."

          "description":"Think about what items you already have that you want to reuse. If you love your bedspread, choose colors that match or accent it for painting or accessories. If your favorite color is red, choose 1 or 2 light accent colors to go with it. Be sure to thoroughly consider what colors or theme you want, and think about if you will still like it in a few months or even a few years. A few ideas for themes include: music, sports, technology, nautical, retro, modern, metropolitan, and boho. If you\u2019re not sure how to begin, start by picking a color you like and go from there."

          "description":"Changing the wall color can give your room a whole new feel. You can paint your walls or put up temporary wallpaper. Feel free to paint only 1 wall, all of them, or even the ceiling. If you choose a dark color, it\u2019s best to use it on an accent wall rather than for your entire room. Be sure to get your parents\u2019 permission, follow all directions, and ventilate the area. If you\u2019re not allowed to paint or paper your walls, try adding a mural or decorating with peel-and-stick decals. You could also make the space look fresh with wall hangings, framed pictures, or other wall d\u00e9cor."

You can use it to do your homework, surf the web, write in your journal, etc. Choose one that fits your needs as well as your personal style; maybe you want a simple, streamlined desk or perhaps you need one with lots of drawers or built-in shelves. Don\u2019t forget to pick a chair to go with your desk, and ensure it is the right height for writing or typing comfortably. If possible, try to sit at the desk before you buy it. That way, you\u2019ll know whether it\u2019s comfortable and a good size for you. A desk can also double as a vanity where you can do your hair and makeup."

A bedspread or comforter can also be a statement piece for your room. Choose a bold pattern or a fun texture to add personality to your room. If your walls are patterned or filled with poster and photos, you may want to stick with a solid bedspread to keep the room from becoming too busy. Add fun throw pillows for extra comfort and style. You can change the whole look of your room by adding new bedding, so pick bedclothes that fit your style! If getting a new bed isn\u2019t an option, you can change the look of your old bed by painting the head and footboard or adding upholstery."

Gaming chairs are great for those who love to play, or you could add ottomans that open for extra seating as well as storage. Pillows also make great seating, so set out some colorful or printed pillows if you can\u2019t get new chairs. If you don\u2019t have a lot of space to work with, ottoman storage cubes are a perfect option. These can serve triple duty as seats, storage containers, and little tables!"

Create zones for different purposes, such as sleeping, working, relaxing, and playing. You can use a curtain, or even furniture, to separate the spaces, like putting a desk in the middle of your room to separate your sleeping area from the space where you watch television or play video games. Think about your daily routines when you\u2019re arranging your space. For example, you\u2019ll need to have plenty of room in front of your dresser so that you can easily open the drawers when you\u2019re getting dressed in the morning."

For example, consider adding a sheer curtain over your blinds for a pop of color. You could even hang beads over your windows or in your doorway.

For example, you might choose posters of your favorite movies or bands, print out some photos you took, or put up some of your own drawings. A great thing about picture frames and cork boards is that you can change out the pictures for new ones whenever you want to update your space!"
