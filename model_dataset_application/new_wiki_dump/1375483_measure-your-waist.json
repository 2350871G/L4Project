Laila Ajani\t\t\tFitness Trainer\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: When you're measuring your waist, look for the smallest part of your waist, which is usually a little higher up than most people think. It's usually a little bit above your navel. If you want to measure your hips as well, it's the opposite\u2014you want to measure where your hips and glutes are the widest."

The measuring tape should be parallel to the floor and fit snugly around your torso without digging into your skin. Make sure that the measuring tape is straight all the way around and is not twisted anywhere, especially in the back."
