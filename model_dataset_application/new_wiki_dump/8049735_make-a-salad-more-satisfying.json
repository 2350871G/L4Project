          "headline":"Use different greens.",
          "description":"If you use the same greens as the base of your salad, you can get bored quickly. The taste may also stop satisfying you. Instead of using iceberg or Romaine lettuce all the time, try different types of greens for the base of your salad. Try Bibb lettuce, green lettuce, or red lettuce, if you want to eat lettuce. Get rid of the lettuce completely and try another green, like arugula, dandelion leaves, kale, spinach, or collards. Try this kale salad recipe. Try cabbage-based salads instead of lettuce. Go for a mix. Put cabbage, lettuce, kale, arugula, spring mix, mesclun mix, or any other green together in the same salad."

          "headline":"Forget the greens completely.",
          "description":"Greens as the base of the salad isn\u2019t the only way you can eat a salad. You can try making the base of your salad out of beets, cucumber, or green beans. You can mix any vegetables together you want for your meal. Try a salad made mostly of tomatoes, Brussels sprouts, carrots, or asparagus. Consider this Thai tomato and green bean salad or this chickpea and feta salad."

          "headline":"Add a base of healthy carbs.",
          "description":"Including healthy carbs can help your salad be more filling and satisfying. Healthy carbs can also provide additional nutrients to the already healthy salad. Try making your base out of grains or sweet potatoes. You can use quinoa, chickpeas, brown rice, farro, or barley. Try this quinoa and vegetable salad, this chickpea and red bean salad, or this quinoa chicken salad."

          "headline":"Turn your favorite foods into a salad.",
          "description":"You can make your salads more interesting by taking your favorite foods, like hamburgers and tacos, and turning them into salads. You get the same base taste through a salad without the extra carbs and calories. For example, you can make a deconstructed hamburger salad. Cook the hamburger meat together in one pan instead of splitting it up into patties. You can also saut\u00e9 mushrooms or onions to add to it. Make a base salad with any greens of your choice. Top the salad with the hamburger meat, cheese, mushrooms, avocado, onions, and condiments, just like a hamburger. A taco salad can be fixed similarly. Make your taco meat out of hamburger, ground turkey, chicken breast, fish, shrimp, or any other meat you like on tacos. Make a bed of greens of your choice. Top the greens with taco meat, cheese, avocado, corn, black beans, black olives, tomatoes, salsa, cilantro, sour cream, or any other taco topping you enjoy."

          "description":"Maybe you think croutons or bacon bits are the only things you can place on top of a salad. Actually, you can throw just about anything on top of a salad. Try roasted nuts and seeds, or raw onions, carrots, or red cabbage for some extra crunch. Try warm, cooked ingredients, like grilled onions and eggplant. Sauteed vegetables can also make a nice salad.

          "description":"Avocado is a healthy fat that can leave you feeling fuller. It is also a delicious addition to a salad. It provides a smooth, creamy texture for the salad. Chop up chunks of avocado and sprinkle them on top of your salad. You can also try mashing the avocado and mixing it with the base for a creamier salad."

          "description":"Salads don\u2019t have to be all savory or vegetables. A little bit of sweetness can totally change your salad experience. Fruit is a perfect addition to a salad that people often forget. Try putting your favorite fruits or no-sugar added dried fruits on your next salad. For example, apples, berries, pears, orange or grapefruit slices, grapes, or pomegranates make great additions to salads. Try dried fruit, such as raisins, figs, dates, cranberries, or apricots, or canned fruit such as mandarin oranges."

You may want to add eggs or ham. Adding leftovers from the night before can be a good way to eat the rest of your food and easily add meat to the salad. Try a salad with a base of kale, tomatoes, chickpeas, apples, and avocado with a vinaigrette. Add roasted chicken breast to it or baked salmon from the night before. Or put together arugula with feta, pears, nuts, black olives, and steak."

          "headline":"Sprinkle cheese on top.",
          "description":"Cheese can help enhance the flavors of the salad. Any cheese will be good on a salad. You can use shredded cheese, small cubes, or thin slices. Throw on your favorite cheese or try to match flavors. For example, pear goes well with gorgonzola or havarti cheese. Apples go well with cheddar, edam, and muenster. Grapes also go well with m\u00fcnster and edam."

          "description":"Switching out your dressing may be a way to make your salad taste more satisfying. You can try olive oil and vinegar, a raspberry vinaigrette, or switching to a ginger-based or spicy dressing. Try a new flavor palate to make the dressing more appealing. Be careful with salad dressings. Make sure to read the label carefully. Salad dressings can be full of calories, fat, and carbs, and they can also be packed with unhealthy artificial ingredients. Consider making your own salad dressing, like Italian, a Vinaigrette or even Avocado Ranch."
