          "headline":"Find the tension discs and regulator.",
          "description":"The tension discs and tension regulator together are called the tension assembly. The tension discs squeeze the thread as it passes between them, while the tension regulator controls the amount of pressure on the discs. The tension regulator is elementary: when adjusted to a higher number (turned clockwise), the discs move closer together, increasing the pressure. Turned to a lower number (counterclockwise), the discs move apart, decreasing pressure. On older machines there are only two tension discs, controlled by a screw or knob. On newer models there are three discs controlled by a dial or keypad on the front of the machine. Unless you have a newer machine that makes automatic upper-tension adjustments, using a thicker thread without resetting the dial will increase the pressure and cause the upper thread flow to decrease."

          "headline":"Find the bobbin.",
          "description":"The flat bobbin-case spring exerts pressure on the thread as it comes out of the bobbin case. You can either have a loading drop in bobbin (you won\u2019t have a bobbin case), or bottom loading with a bobbin case in a compartment below the needle. The amount of pressure on the bobbin is regulated by a small screw at the rear of the spring. Both the spring and screw are easy to locate when the machine has a separate bobbin case. When the machine has a drop-in bobbin with a built-in bobbin case, locating the tension screw can be more challenging but a little bit of searching will prove it\u2019s there. In either case, to increase the resistance, use a small screwdriver to turn the screw clockwise (to a higher number) or counterclockwise (to a lower number). Turn the screw in small increments and never more than a quarter-turn between tests."

          "headline":"Understand tension.",
          "description":"Tension is what keeps your bottom and top stitches in equal tension with one another. In other words, it is what keeps your front and back stitches looking the same. Both the top and bottom tension must work together in order to create consistent stitching. If your top and bottom stitches aren\u2019t even, it may be due to your tension not being right on the top or bottom. Most domestic sewing machines are of the \"lockstitch\" variety. That means an upper thread and a lower thread \"lock\" together. When they don\u2019t \u201clock\u201d together properly, you could have an issue with the tension."

Remember you want your stitches to look even on both sides of your fabric. If the thread is so tight it\u2019s causing the fabric to bunch around it or if the stitching is loose and falling apart, you might have an issue with the tension. If your stitches look perfect and your sewing machine is sewing wonderfully, don\u2019t touch your tension knobs!"

          "description":"You\u2019ve sewn a test seam or two and you\u2019ve inspected the seams. A perfect stitch will have threads locked midway between the two layers of cloth, with no loops on the top or bottom of the seam and no puckers in the cloth. An easy way to think of the thread balance is tug of war. You have your top thread and your bobbin thread pulling on each side. If they\u2019re both pulling equally, the seam will be even and consistent. If one side is pulling too much, the thread from the other side will be visible. If the bobbin thread shows on the top side of the seam and the top thread is straight, the upper tension is too tight. If top thread shows on the underside of the seam and the lower thread is straight, the upper tension is too loose."

          "headline":"Inspect your machine.",
          "description":"There are multiple problems that could be causing issues with your sewing machine that aren\u2019t the tension. Make sure to check these possible causes before adjusting your tension knobs. Incorrectly threaded machine: Is all of the thread running through the thread guides? Is thread unwinding freely from the spool or is it catching? Is the bobbin inserted correctly? Dirty machine: Thread ends can get lodged between tension discs, around the bobbin case, and under the throat pale. This can cause an increase in resistance and restrict the thread flow. Check all of these areas to ensure they\u2019re clear. Damaged machine parts: Bent needles and bobbins and rough or damaged surfaces on the needle eyes, thread guides, tension discs, take-up lever, throat plate, presser foot, bobbin case, or in the bobbin area can all cause problems. Give your machine a general inspection and remember that even the tiniest damage can distort tension."

        {
          "headline":"Pay attention to your needles, threads, and fabrics.",
          "description":"Different thread sizes on the top and in the bobbin can throw off your basic tension settings. A needle that is too large or too small can also unbalance your stitches. If you\u2019re getting puckers on a lightweight fabric, trying shortening the stitch length to 1.75mm. All of these small details can wreak havoc on your project so make sure you\u2019re detail-oriented when setting up your machine for a project. Polyester thread is a a true all-purpose thread, and it\u2019s a good choice for most sewing projects. Wool thread, on the other hand, is very thick and if you were to use it, you'd have to adjust your tension. Common heavy duty fabrics include canvas and burlap while cotton and polyester are common fabrics with a standard weight. If you\u2019re switching between heavy fabrics and something of a lighter weight, you\u2019d have to adjust your tension to keep the stitches even. Needles come in various sizes for different purposes. There are thicker needles designed for denim that won\u2019t break when they\u2019re being used and thin needles that won\u2019t damage thin, delicate fabrics. When buying needles, you can consult someone in the store to help you find the best option for your fabric."

If you\u2019ve done that and still need to adjust the lower thread, locate your bobbin in either the top loading drop in bobbin (you won\u2019t have a bobbin case), or bottom loading with a bobbin case. With a bottom loading bobbin, an easy way to test the tension is to take the thread hanging from your bobbin case in your hand. If it doesn\u2019t unwind at all, your tension is too tight and needs to be loosened. If the thread unwinds with no effort, your tension is too loose and you\u2019ll need to tighten it. You want to hold the thread and have it drop just a few inches. When that happens, your tension is perfect. Use a tiny screwdriver and turn the screw on the side of the bobbin case by \u00bc turn. Turn it right to increase the tension and left to decrease it. Test the tension again. Repeat until the thread only drops a few inches. Similarly, with a top loading bobbin, you use a screwdriver and turn the screw by \u00bc turn, testing your tension between each adjustment with a test seam on scrap fabric.
