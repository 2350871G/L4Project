It typically contains kaffir lime leaves, shrimp paste, lemongrass, garlic, and green chilies. Try 1-2 teaspoons (17-34 g) for a can of coconut milk. This works well for meat marinades."

It has red chilies, lemongrass, shallots, garlic, shrimp paste, galangal, and coriander roots and leaves. Add it to soups, condiments, sauces, and curries. Coriander leaves are known as cilantro in the United States. Try this in a variety of dishes."

Spoon in the amount of curry paste you want to use, and stir it around for a few minutes, which will help release the paste's flavors. Then, you can add other ingredients you plan on using. If you're using onions or garlic, you can add the paste after these get translucent in the pan."

The oil in the paste will keep the ingredients fresh and potent, but only if you keep it in the refrigerator once you've opened it. To keep it even fresher, try wiping the inside of the jar clean at the top. Then, pour in just enough olive oil to cover the top of the paste, which will form a barrier to help keep it fresher."

If you're afraid it will be a little too spicy, mix it with an equal portion of olive oil first.
