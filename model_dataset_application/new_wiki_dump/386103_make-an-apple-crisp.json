          "description":"Make sure your butter is firm and cold before you start using it. This will give the oats, sugars, and flour something solid to bind onto while they cook, leading to big, delicious crumble topping. It can help to cut the butter into 1/2\" cubes ahead of time and place in the freezer while you measure everything else out. The amount of butter in your recipe is up to you. If you want a very rich topping, you can add as many as 8\u20139 tablespoons (120\u2013130 ml), though you should add 1\u20132 tablespoons (14.8\u201329.6 ml) more flour and brown sugar if you do."

You can cut the butter three ways:\n\nFood Processor: Pulse the mixture until there are still 1/4\" clumps and none of the butter is uncoated with flour. Pastry Blender: These D-shaped tools have 4-5 wires at the end which effectively cut the butter up into thin slices. Cut until you have a gravel-like consistency. Fingers: Freeze the whole mixture for 2-3 minutes before working, then quickly mash the butter into the flour, aiming for a crumbly, gravel-like mixture."
