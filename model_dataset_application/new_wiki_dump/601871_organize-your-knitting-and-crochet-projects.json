      "description":"Again, go through all your drawers, baskets, and any other place that holds yarn. It is important for you to visualize what you have. If you find any yarn that is not in a ball, hank, or skein, this is the time to ball up your yarn. Line up all your yarn and take a photo while you have it out. If you can, store it in clear bins. That way, you will know what you have without getting it all out, and you will be able to find yarn later without too much digging."

      "description":"There are some projects that you will want to keep and other projects that you will want to get rid of. The decision of whether to get rid of a project or not is up to you. If you are not sure whether or not you want to keep the project, keep it for now; you can always get rid of it later. Date-specific projects whose date has passed should definitely be rid of. For example, an incomplete newborn-sized baby hat for a friend's two-year-old son should be gotten rid of if you cannot give it to another newborn baby; the same son won't be a newborn again. \"Millennium\" projects slated to be done in the year 2000 or 2001 should be scrapped, since the new millennium has already started. If you haven't shown any interest in the project for a year, it's time to let the project go. The yarn can be used to make a new project."

      "headline":"Divide the remaining skeins of yarn into groups based on projects.",
      "description":"Go through your whole pile of yarn and \"assign\" each skein, ball, or hank of yarn to a project. Choose yarn from your stash that will fit the each project's needs. Always assign a few extra skeins of yarn to each project just in case you need that extra yarn. Be sure to check the dye lot numbers of all the skeins. If a project needs more yarn than you have, put the project and its yarn to the side; you can deal with it later."

    {
      "headline":"Put each project in a separate storage place.",
      "description":"Use whatever storage method works for you, but make sure that yarn from different projects don't mix together; this will make it easier to find what you need for your projects. For example, if you use shelves to organize your yarn, put yarn for one project in each cubby in the shelf. If you do not have shelves or any storage container that can easily be divided into small parts, put the yarn for each project into separate gallon-sized resealable storage bags, and label the bags with the project name."

There are many ways to organize your yarn; pick the one that fits you the best. If you want to start a new project in the future, look to this pile first for your yarn needs; you might be able to make the project without buying new yarn."

Do you have all the needles, hooks, yarns, et cetera needed to make the project? Write down everything you need that you don't have so that you will remember to pick up these items the next time you go to the craft store. Remember that you may need to use a different size hook or needle to get the gauge, so be prepared to have different sizes of needles and hooks."
