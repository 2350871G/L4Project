Try to get a photo with the sky in it, or if you are trying to capture something unique like a river, have something like the riverbank sitting just on the top of the photo. If the sky is partly cloudy, the best time to take a photo is when the cloud just sits on the horizon."

DO NOT take a photo of the sun directly, unless it's seconds before it disappears, as your finished product will end up as a white blank photo. Take a photo of the area near the sun rise or sun set, depending upon the time of day."
