  "text":" Responding to a Blood Stain on Leather Treat the stain quickly. The faster you react to a blood stain on leather, the more likely it is that the stain will be removed. As soon as the stain happens, dab the blood with a clean, dry cloth. This will help to remove some of the blood and will prevent it from seeping further into the pores of the leather. Test the fabric. Before cleaning a blood stain from leather, you should test the cleaning agent on the leather fabric. Choose a section of the material that is not visible and place a few drops of the cleaning agent onto the fabric. For example, test the bottom of a handbag, the heel of a shoe, or the back of a sofa. Wait five minutes. You should wait approximately five minutes to see if the cleaning agent stained the fabric. If you notice any discolouration, or if the leather begins to crack, you should not proceed with cleaning the larger stain. Cleaning with Soap and Water Fill a small bowl with water and mild soap. Mix together room temperature water with a few drops of mild soap or dish detergent. Stir the solution until suds are formed. Dip a sponge into the soap solution. Use a clean washcloth or sponge and dip it into the soap solution. Squeeze the sponge so that it is damp, but not dripping wet. Blot the stain. Gently blot the stain with the soapy sponge or cloth. Do not rub the stain because this can actually push the stain further into the leather or spread the stain to a larger surface area. Rinse the leather. Then, wet a new cloth with water and dab the stain to remove any excess soap that may be left on the leather. Dry the area with a cloth. Use a dry washcloth or towel to blot the cleaned area until the surface is dry. Removing a Stain with Hydrogen Peroxide Apply a few drops of hydrogen peroxide to a dry washcloth. Use a clean dry washcloth and add a few drops of hydrogen peroxide to the cloth. You want the cloth to be slightly damp, but not dripping wet. Blot the stain with the cloth. Do not rub the leather with the hydrogen peroxide. This may actually spread the stain, making it harder to clean. Wait for bubbles to form. The hydrogen peroxide will react with the blood and create tiny bubbles. The blood should be lifted from the fabric through the bubbles. Wipe away the bubbles using a dry washcloth. Dry the area with a cloth. Once you have removed the bubbles from the fabric, use a dry and clean cloth to blot up any excess hydrogen peroxide that may remain on the leather.",
