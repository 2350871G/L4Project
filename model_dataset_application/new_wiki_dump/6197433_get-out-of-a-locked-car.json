          "description":"This means making a mess and potentially causing injury, so take precautions to lessen the harm. Avoid the windshield unless you have no other choice, as it's made to be unbreakable (safety glass) and even if you did manage to shatter it, the stickiness of safety glass can make it hard to get through and you'd need to push the majority of it out before you could get out. Side and rear windows are the best options for escape. If you have no tools or heavy objects to break the window with, use your feet. If you have high heels, these might work when placed at the center of the window. Aim to kick near the front of the window or along the hinges (see the demonstration in the video below). Be aware that it's very hard to break a window by kicking, so find these breakpoints. If you have a heavy object, aim for the center of the window. A rock, hammer, steering wheel lock, umbrella, screwdriver, laptop, large camera, etc., might all serve as suitable battering objects. Even the keys might work if you're strong enough. If you've already thought ahead, you might have a window breaking tool handy in the car. There are various tools available, such as a \"center punch\", which is a small tool that could be easily stowed in the driver's side door or on the dashboard, for fast retrieval. This power punch is usually spring-loaded and can also be found in a hammer shape. Failing that, you could also carry your own small hammer."
