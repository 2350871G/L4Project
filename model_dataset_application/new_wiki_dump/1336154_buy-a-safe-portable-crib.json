Older cribs may also be worn down. Things like loose screws could harm your baby. When looking at cribs, check the box for the production date. A new crib does not necessarily mean the crib is safe.

This assures that the crib has proper ventilation, keeping your baby safe. If the crib has slats, make sure they are no more than 2 \u20448 inches (6.0 cm) apart (about the width of a can of soda). This is a mandatory standard, but it's good to check."

If there is a mattress pad, there should be very little space between the mattress pad and the mattress. A baby could roll into this gap and suffocate. Stay away from soft and cushy bedding. This can increase the risk of your baby suffocating. Make sure to buy sheets that fit your mattress properly; portable crib mattresses may be smaller than regular crib mattresses."

Most portable cribs come with a carrying case or bag with straps to help carry them comfortably. If you do not travel a lot, a sturdier, heavier crib may be okay.
