          "description":"Like in any form of visual arts photography requires some knowledge about how colors react to light. There are two color properties that can be helpful when trying to get photographed objects to turn out correctly. Once you learn how to correctly identify the color situation you're dealing with and how these situations affect different hues of color you can photograph colors more accurately. Additive colors are the result of adding white light to a color against a black background. In this situation, if you add equal parts of red, green and blue you'll get white. Whenever you use a lighted screen such as the computer screen you use this system. This color system is called RGB or Red, Green, Blue system. Whenever you're using high exposure or a flash you are adding a white light thus this is an additive color situation. Subtractive colors  are the results of what you if illuminate a colored filter from behind with the white light. If you mix all of these colors together in equal parts you get black. It's the opposite of the additive. This property is most commonly used in mixing colors with any art mediums not involving light. This system is also called the CYMK or Cyan, Yellow, Magenta, Black. If your object is an art project on a sheet of white paper or is surrounded with a lot of white without flash you are in a subtractive setting."

These colors easily transform themselves into other colors different of which they are viewed with the human eye, in the viewfinder or on the actual photograph. Yellow lemons can turn to green. Bright red poppies turn out orange or pink. Red produces very strong wavelengths that can easily take over a photograph and cause blobs, spots, or other strange phenomena in photography. Bright saturated reds are very tricky even for professionals to photograph accurately. The color of the walls in a room indoors or the surrounding buildings or other things outside can be reflected onto your subject affecting the color. Some darker colors can affect the colour as well. Dark burgundy can become bright reddish purple and not deep and rich. Many items are not just one color. What appears to be bluish green to a naked eye under the magnification of a camera in macro zoom can have extra spots of yellowish green. Almost every leaf is or flower petal is not that pure color but has veins of many different tones, tints, shades, and even other colors. These colors blend with each other and cause different colors.
