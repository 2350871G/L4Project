The pink flesh is exposed on one side, and the skin (typically scaled) on the opposite side. Depending on your location and the time of year, you may find Atlantic, Coho, Chinook, Sockeye, and King, wild, farmed, fresh, or frozen.

  "text":" Traditional Baking Buy whole salmon fillets when preparing baked salmon. The flesh can range in color from a pale pink to a deep red, depending on the salmon species available. A salmon fillet is cut in half lengthwise down the middle of the fish. The pink flesh is exposed on one side, and the skin (typically scaled) on the opposite side. Depending on your location and the time of year, you may find Atlantic, Coho, Chinook, Sockeye, and King, wild, farmed, fresh, or frozen. Each option features subtle differences in taste, texture, and appearance. Leave the skin on the fillet and bake skin-side down. Cooking fish with the skin-side down helps retain its moisture during the cooking process. This is especially important when baking salmon, as it tends to dry out easily. Set the oven temperature between 325 \u00baF/175\u00baC and 375\u00baF/190\u00baC. The right temperature depends on the recipe used and the size of the fillet being baked. Set the oven to the lower end of the temperature range for smaller fillets and the higher end for larger fillets. Cooking the fish at too high or too low of a temperature will dry it out. Cook the salmon fillet in a covered, oven-proof baking dish. Keep the fish covered during the process, as it helps the fish retain its moisture and speeds up the cooking time.
