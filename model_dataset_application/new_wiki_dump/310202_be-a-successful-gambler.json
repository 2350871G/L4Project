Your personal system might involve strategies like betting low, only taking certain odds, or quitting after a predetermined number of wins. For the most part, this will be a matter of understanding the odds and taking them into account when making a wager. Games like blackjack and roulette, for instance, are all about making predictions based on probability. Games like poker, on the other hand, allow players to use deception and cunning to gain the advantage."

Make your entries detailed\u2014include the game, date, odds, and stakes, along with your thoughts on how the game went and what you could do differently next time.

Taking the monetary aspect out of the equation will allow you to gain valuable experience in a risk-free environment. Online games can be a good way to stay sharp when you're unable to make it to the casino. Just make sure there's not a real buy-in required to play. For a more realistic simulation, try betting with hypothetical money. That way, you can keep score to see how much you would have won or loss in a real game."
