  "text":" Basic Beef Tapa Slice the beef into thin, pinky-width slices. You want to cut against the grain. To cut against the grain, look at the long horizontal strands that run through the steak and cut perpendicular to them. Don't be afraid to leave a little fat on the beef, it will help it cook later. Mix the vinegar, soy sauce, pepper, and garlic in a bowl. You want to cut the garlic finely into small chunks. Mix your ingredients well. Add the beef to the mixing bowl and massage it with marinade. Take your time to let the beef soak up the mixture, using your fingers to lightly message the meat. Think -- honestly -- about giving a gentle message to a loved one! Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Make sure you create a nice, tight seal around the beef -- it will marinate for a long time.
