  "text":" Making Dulce de Leche in the Can Remove the label from the can. Only use a can of condensed milk that has a sealed lid for this method: do not use a can with a pull-tab lid. There will be a fair bit of pressure building up inside the can as you boil it, and you don\u2019t want the lid popping off. Fill the saucepan with room temperature water. Make sure the can is fully immersed and that there\u2019s an extra two inches (five cm) of water covering the can. This will prevent the can from overheating and possibly exploding, and prevent the milk from burning. Place the unopened can in a medium or large saucepan. By placing the can on its side, you will prevent it from bouncing around as the water boils. Bring the water to a simmer over high heat. When it begins to simmer, turn it down to medium heat and allow to simmer for two to three hours (two hours for a lighter dulce de leche, or three hours if you want the sauce thicker and darker). Check on the can every 30 minutes. Turn the can every half hour to prevent scorching. Top up the water as needed to ensure there\u2019s always one to two extra inches (two-and-a-half to five cm) of water covering the can. Remove the saucepan from the heat. When two to three hours are up, remove the can with a slotted spoon or tongs and place it on a wire rack. Allow it to cool to room temperature. Don\u2019t open the can until it has fully cooled. Using a Double Boiler Prepare your double boiler. Fill the bottom of a double boiler with about two inches (five cm) of water and bring it to a boil. Open a can of sweetened condensed milk and pour the contents into the top portion. Use a saucepan and a glass bowl if you don\u2019t have a double boiler. Half fill a small or medium saucepan with water, and set a large glass bowl inside the saucepan, making sure it doesn't touch the water (if it does, empty out some water). Make sure the glass bowl is big enough to form a seal with the saucepan. Heat the milk. Place the milk over the boiling water in the double boiler and cover with a lid. Bring it to a simmer over medium heat. Stirring occasionally, simmer for one-and-a-half to two hours, until the milk becomes thick and reaches the desired caramel color. Use aluminum foil to create a lid if you are using a saucepan and glass bowl. Remove from the heat. As it cools, whisk the dulce de leche until it is smooth and free of lumps. Allow it to cool for about 20 minutes before serving or using in a recipe. Making Dulce de Leche in the Oven Preheat your oven to 425 F (218 C). Open a can of sweetened condensed milk and pour the contents into a nine-inch pie plate. Cover the pie plate with foil. Place the pie plate in a larger baking dish. A larger pie plate or large roasting pan will do. Add hot water to the baking dish until it comes halfway up the pie plate. Bake for one hour. After an hour, remove the baking dish (with the pie plate inside) from the oven. Remove the foil and whisk the milk. Check the consistency and color. If the milk hasn\u2019t achieved the desired thickness or caramel color, cover it with the foil again and return the pie plate and water-filled baking dish to the oven. Top up the water if necessary. Check every 15 minutes. After the first hour, check on the confection frequently until it reaches the desired consistency and caramel color. Remove it from the oven when you are happy with the dulce de leche, or until it has achieved the color of peanut butter. Transfer to a mixing bowl. As the dulce de leche cools, whisk it until it\u2019s smooth and creamy, about three minutes. Heating in a Pressure Cooker Prepare the can. Remove the label from the can of sweetened condensed milk. Place the unopened can on its side directly on the bottom of the pressure cooker. Fill the pressure cooker with enough water to fully immerse the can and cover it with an extra inch (two-and-a-half cm) of water. Do not exceed the maximum fill line on your pressure cooker. Secure (lock) the lid and heat. Heat on high until the pressure cooker reaches the proper pressure. Immediately lower the heat slightly, but keep the temperature high enough that the pressure cooker maintains pressure. You want the heat high enough to simmer the water, but not so high that the pressure cooker whistles. Continue cooking for 40 minutes. When the 40 minutes are up, remove the pressure cooker from the heat. Release the pressure. Allow the pressure cooker to naturally release its steam and reduce its pressure, or with the quick release valve. Do not open the pressure cooker until all the steam has been released and the pressure has dropped. Open the pressure cooker and remove the can. Use tongs or a slotted spoon to remove the can from the water and place it on a wire rack. Allow it to cool to room temperature, and don\u2019t open the can until it has. Heating in a Slow Cooker Prepare the can. Remove the label. Place the unopened can on its side on the bottom of the slow cooker. Fill the slow cooker with enough water to fully immerse the can and cover it with an extra two inches (five cm) of water. Heat on low for eight to 10 hours. For a lighter dulce de leche, cook for eight hours; for a thicker and darker sauce, heat for ten hours. Turn off the slow cooker and remove the can. Use tongs or a slotted spoon. Allow the can to cool on a wire rack to room temperature before opening.",
