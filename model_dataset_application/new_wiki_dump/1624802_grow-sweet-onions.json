          "description":"Your onions will have the best chance if they're grown in loose, fertile, and well-draining soil with a pH between 6.0 and 6.8. Use a tiller to break up the soil in the garden bed. Spread 2 inches (5 cm) of mature compost or aged manure over the garden bed and work it into the soil with the tiller. You can test the pH of the soil with a home soil test kit or with a pH meter. Use lime to increase the pH of your soil, and sulphur to lower it. Amending the soil with compost will add nutrients and help the soil drain better. The ground must be loose to allow sulfur to drain through; otherwise, the onions won\u2019t be as sweet.

The team at Grow it Organically says, \"In organic gardening, we have a mantra: 'Feed the soil to feed the plant.' If you take care of the soil, you're going to have healthy plants. Of course, there are other things that go into it, like variety selection, plant spacing, and proper hydration, but having good soil is probably 70% of the battle.\""

Use a rake to mix the fertilizer with the soil. When growing sweet onions, avoid sulfur-based fertilizers, because these will make the onions more pungent."

          "description":"Use your hands or a spade to build the soil up into rows that are 4 inches (10 cm) high. Space the rows 16 inches (41 cm) apart. Making rows for the onions is particularly important if your soil has a high clay content. Instead of growing the onions in rows, you can also plant them in raised beds that have been amended with compost and fertilizer. Planting sweet onions in rows or raised beds is important because it will help the water drain better, and this will produce sweeter onions. In a container, you have complete control over the soil medium, so it\u2019s not necessary to create rows before planting."

Don\u2019t plant the onions more than an inch (2.5 cm) deep; otherwise, the leaves may rot and the bulbs won\u2019t grow as large.
