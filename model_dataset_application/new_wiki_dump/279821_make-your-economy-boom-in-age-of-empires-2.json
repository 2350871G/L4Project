The default hotkeys are H for town center and C to create a villager (only after selecting the town center). Thus, the fastest way to do this is to press H and then press shift-C. The shift selects 5 at a time. This pattern is perhaps the most important hotkey pattern in the game. Have two villagers build two houses. This will temporarily increase the population to 15, allowing more villagers to be created. Do not have one villager build one house each - both villagers build one house at a time in order to keep the steady flow of villager creation. Once the two houses are completed, have the two villagers build a lumber camp near a forest (your scout should have already found at least one by now). Select your scout and scout around what is currently visible to you. Finding the 4 initial sheep is critical in the Dark Age - the earlier they are sighted, the better. Occasionally, one of the sheep may already be visible in the fog. If this occurs, have the scout go to where the sheep is. The 4 sheep will be converted to your colors and you can continue scouting for the other 4 sheep (in pairs) that are farther away, the berries, two boars, deer (not available on some maps), gold mines, and stone mines. Have the other villager chop wood near the town center."

Simply select all of them and gather the one that is at the town center, not the other two right outside it. Make sure that you are keeping exactly two sheep at the town center so that the villagers do not have to walk in order to deposit. After Loom is researched, keep creating more villagers. You may have to brute force the shepherds (selecting all of them and deposit) in order to reach the 50 food requirement.

Beware of this as time will have been wasted.There are two boars to hunt. When the food count for the first boar reaches about 130-150, send one villager (NOT the one used for the first lure) and repeat the luring process.

You should have about 10-12 villagers on wood. Build a mining camp next to your gold pile located near your town center. While you don't need gold to advance to the Feudal Age, it is important to start in the Dark Age (or at least while researching Feudal) because you won't be in the Feudal Age for very long. Some civilizations start out with -100 gold, and it is highly recommended to get a head-start on gold. No more than 3 villagers should be allocated to gold. Farms are the primary source of food later on, but can be made in the Dark Age. 60 wood is the requirement, and you'll need to create some farms because your deer and berries will be exhausted of food. Farms are based on wood, and you may even need to allocate food-gathering villagers to chopping wood. Farms, ideally, should be located around the town center, as they can garrison, but if you run out of room, farms can be located around the mill."

The town centers being created should prevent you from having to build another mill. Unlike the mills, more lumber camps should be built. This is especially important in the castle age, as rushers will target lumberjacks that are normally found outside the town center vicinity (when you garrison, the lumberjacks will not head to the town center). Lumber camps should also be built because forests will be cut down, and new lumber camps will decrease the walking time that is gradually being increased. Villagers should be allocated to mining gold. Thus, more mining camps should be built. If you are not steadily allocating villagers to mine gold, then the 800 gold requirement suddenly becomes a much harder target. The allocation to mining gold is especially important in the Castle Age because that is when you should be developing your military. Most military units will cost gold (for some civilizations, it is even more critical as their militaries are expensive). Mining stone is a much lesser priority as stone is primarily only used for towers, town centers, castles, walls, and Murder Holes."
