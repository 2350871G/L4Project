Furniture that is sold at yard sales is cheaper than what you could find anywhere else, either because they do not know its worth, or they just want to get rid of it regardless of price. Do not be afraid to haggle. You will often be able to talk the seller into offering you a lower price."

Thrift store inventories change regularly depending on what is donated each day, so make a habit out of stopping by to find hidden treasures. When you go to browse their inventories, be prepared to haul the item away yourself."

Salvaged items are used by definition, but some effort has been put into refurbishing them. These pieces typically have a more traditional and rustic aesthetic. Know what you\u2019re looking for when you go to a salvage store, and don\u2019t be afraid to put in a little effort to spruce up a piece of furniture. Cleaning it and adding a new coat of paint can transform the furniture into the perfect piece for your home."
