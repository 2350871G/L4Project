          "headline":"Keep your office items in empty pill bottles.",
          "description":"Many people keep loose items like paper clips, thumb tacks, and so on in their desk drawers. But these items can be hard to find unless they are collected properly. Empty pill bottles offer a great solution to storing these office supplies. If you wish, you could label the top of each empty pill bottle with permanent marker to indicate what is in it."

          "headline":"Hide a spare key in the container.",
          "description":"Stick a spare key in the pill container. Plant it in the lawn near the back of your house or somewhere out of the way. Don\u2019t bury it too deeply. The white top of the pill bottle should be parallel with the surface of the ground. Place a fist-sized rock over the pill bottle in a location where it would not seem out of place. This will allow you to hide a spare key outside your home. In the event you\u2019re locked out, you can get back in by using this key. Hiding the key in the pill bottle protects it from rain, which could cause it to rust."

          "headline":"Store jewelry and cosmetic items in the pill bottle.",
          "description":"Bobby pins, hair ties, and other small fashion accessories are often difficult to store properly, since they get lost in regular drawers and storage containers. Empty pill bottles make perfect containers for these items. Use one for bobby pins, another for earrings, and so on. If you wanted, you could tape a label on each so you know what\u2019s inside. If you have a taller empty pill bottle, you could store your eyeliner and makeup brushes in it."

          "headline":"Place your cotton swabs in the pill bottle.",
          "description":"Cotton swabs are great for cleaning small tubes and fine objects. But their small size also makes them hard to store. Most people just keep them in the box they come packaged in, but if you wanted to keep them somewhere more accessible, you could just store them in an empty pill bottle. If you are not able to seal the pill bottle with the lid, that\u2019s okay. You can just leave the pill bottle on your bathroom counter and recycle the lid, or place it somewhere for safekeeping (in the event that you ever want to put your empty pill bottle to a different use)."

          "description":"Stuffing your earbuds in your backpack, handbag, or pocket could cause them to become tangled or damaged. Instead, extend your earbuds to their maximum length and untangle any knots. Fold them in half three or four consecutive times, then place them in an empty pill bottle. Your earbuds will then be safe and ready for use the next time you want to use them."

Label a corresponding number of pill bottles with the various piping tip sizes or descriptions. For instance, if you have three piping tips that excrete a star shape, write \u201cstar\u201d on the bottle cap and stick the piping tips in the empty pill bottle."
