If your piece is marked with the word \"platinum,\" it is at least 95% pure. More commonly, you will see a number like 850 followed by \"pt\" or \"plat.\" This indicates that 850/1000 parts are platinum, meaning the piece is 85% pure. Your platinum jewelry may not be stamped if it is from a country that does not require these markings or if it is very old. Any metal that is less than 50% platinum will not be marked."

It is also more scratch-resistant, although it can still be scratched. However, you should still see very few scratches. Finally, if the piece is tarnished, it is silver, not platinum. The color and visual qualities of the metal can tell you if the metal is likely to be platinum, but conduct other tests to be sure."
