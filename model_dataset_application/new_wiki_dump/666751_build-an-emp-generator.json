You don\u2019t need one, but it will tell you the voltage of your capacitor. Isolating a Camera's Circuit Board Obtain a disposable camera. It doesn't have to be anything fancy, just a cheap point and shoot you can pick up at any convenient store. Make sure the film is all used up before taking apart the camera. Open the case. Using the flat edge of a screwdriver, carefully pry the camera apart. Be careful not to touch the printed circuit board or any metal parts inside. Slip on a pair of rubber gloves. You'll be dealing with the potential of getting a painful shock if you accidentally touch the flash capacitor, which carries about 300 volts. Locate the capacitor.

Remove the battery from the device before continuing. Creating the EMP Generator Prepare your wire. Locate your wire and cut it to the desired length.
