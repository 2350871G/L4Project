  "text":" Butterfly Stitch Insert the hook into the first stitch. Insert the hook into the stitch indicated by the pattern. At this point, you should be in the middle of a crochet project and you should already have one loop on your hook. The butterfly stitch is worked into two stitches, and this stitch is the first of the two. Draw up a loop. Yarn over the hook once from back to front, then pull the hook back through to the front of the work. This should create a second loop on your hook. Yarn over an pull through once. Wrap the yarn over the hook once from back to front. Pull this yarn-over through the top loop of your hook. Afterward, you should have two loops on your hook. When you complete this step, you have completed one \"wing\" of the butterfly. Insert the hook into the second stitch. Insert the hook into the stitch immediately following the one you just worked in. This is the second and final stitch you will work into while completing the butterfly stitch. Draw up a loop. Yarn over the hook once from back to front, then pull the yarn and hook back through to the front of the work. This should create another loop on your hook, giving you a total of three loops. Yarn over and pull through twice. Wrap the yarn around the hook from back to front, then pull this yarn-over through the top two loops on your hook. There should be two loops left on your hook. Yarn over and pull through twice. Wrap the yarn over the hook from back to front once more, then pull this final yarn-over through the remaining two loops on your hook. You should be left with one loop on your hook. The completion of this step completes a second butterfly wing. Chain one. Work one chain stitch from the loop on your hook. This chain stitch completes the butterfly stitch and prepares the yarn for your next stitch. Work a foundation chain.

Slip stitch the first and last chains together to form a ring. Note that the yarn should be tied to the hook using a standard slip knot. Single crochet into the ring. Chain one, then single crochet three times into the center of the foundation ring. The chain at the beginning of the round acts as a turning chain. It sets the height of the round to accommodate the height of the single crochet stitch. Chain and slip the first wing. Work a series of 16 chain stitches from the loop on your hook. Upon reaching the end of this chain, slip stitch into the last single crochet you made. Doing so will create one of the large upper wing halves of the butterfly. Single crochet into the ring. Work three more single crochets into the center of your foundation ring. Chain and slip the second wing. Work 11 chain stitches from the loop on your hook. Slip stitch the final chain of this group into the last single crochet you made. This step will create the smaller lower half of the wing you started previously. After completing this step, one full wing is finished. Mirror the small wing half. Repeat the previous two steps to work the second small wing half of the butterfly. Single crochet into the foundation ring three times. Chain 11 times. Slip stitch the last chain to the last single crochet. Mirror the large wing half. Repeat the same steps used to complete the first upper wing half to work a second upper wing half. Single crochet into the foundation ring three times. Chain 16 times. Slip stitch the last of these chains to the last single crochet you created. After completing this step, both butterfly wings should be complete. Close the circle. Single crochet once into the foundation ring, then join this single crochet to the very first single crochet you worked using another slip stitch. At this point, the shape of the butterfly is complete. Fasten off the yarn. Cut a tail roughly 2 inches (5 cm) long. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten off the yarn. Weave the excess tail into the stitches to hide it. After fastening off the yarn, the butterfly is complete and ready to attach to another separately created crochet work. Position the butterfly over the work. Place the butterfly applique over the work you wish to attach it to. Consider pinning it in place to prevent it from moving around as you attach it. If you want to attach the butterfly applique using surface crochet, as these instructions will demonstrate, you must attach it to a previously created crochet work. You can attach it to other materials, as well, but you will need to do so by sewing it on or gluing it in place. Make sure that the butterfly is perfectly positioned over the work before proceeding. Surface slip stitch down the center. Work a straight line of surface slip stitches onto the material beneath the butterfly, trapping the bottom and top of the butterfly's center beneath those stitches. Work one surface slip stitch onto the first stitch of the material. This stitch should fall directly beneath the bottom center of the butterfly.
