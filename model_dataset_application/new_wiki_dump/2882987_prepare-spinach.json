          "description":"Browse the spinach section at the store or farmer's market for bunches with dark green, fresh leaves. Don't get a bunch with yellow, wilted, bruised, or mushy leaves. It's important to select fresh spinach so that it can last long enough to be part of a tasty meal. At the grocery store, most of the spinach you find will already be separated from its stems and will be in a sealed bag. At the farmer's market, most spinach will come in a nice leafy bunch. The most common type of spinach is smooth-leafed spinach, which has flat, smooth leaves that are perfect for cleaning. Savoy spinach handles the cold better than other types of spinach. However, its leaves are deeply crinkled, making it harder to wash the soil and grit away from the leaves. Baby spinach is simply spinach that is plucked after 15-20 days of growth while regular spinach is plucked after 45-60 days of growth. Baby spinach has more tender leaves and is better used in salads, while adult spinach is better for cooking."

If you've purchased the type of spinach in a sealed bag, make sure that you keep it closed tight with a clip after you've opened it so that the remaining spinach remains fresh. If you don't plan on using it right away, then you should store it until you're ready to use it. You shouldn't wash or dry it until you're ready to cook it, or it will wilt."

Though the stems are still edible, they're a little tough and unpleasant to the taste, and your spinach leaves will be tastier without them."

If you purchased spinach in a bag that is sealed and states that it's been washed, then you can still wash it to be safe, but you don't have to take as many precautions as you would with spinach from the market. Here's how you can go about washing the spinach:\nSeparate the leaves. Run your hand down the rib to separate the leafy bit from the stem. This is optional. Some people like to eat the stems. Put the leaves into a bowl of water, swish them around, and drain the water. Repeat until all soil has been removed."

You can toss it in a colander and then leave it out for 10 minutes and wait for it to dry or you can even gently pat it with paper towels. Just make sure you do this carefully so you don't end up mushing the spinach together. Once it's dry, you should start cooking it as soon as you can to avoid having it wilt."
