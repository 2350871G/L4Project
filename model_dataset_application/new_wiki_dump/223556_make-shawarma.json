          "description":"To make the tahini sauce, all you have to do is combine the garlic and lemon juice in a medium bowl and let it sit for 5 minutes. Then, you can whisk in the tahini, olive oil, yogurt, and \u00be teaspoon of salt until the mixture is smooth. If the mixture feels too thick to pour, then you can add another 1 or 2 tablespoons (14.8 or 29.6 ml) of water and mix it in to make it a bit thinner. You can make the sauce while you\u2019re cooking your chicken, lamb, beef, veal, or other meat, if you want to save time. Additionally, you can make the sauce two days in advance and store it in the fridge until it\u2019s ready to be used."

          "description":"Pickled cabbage is another important ingredient to making a tasty shawarma. All you have to do to make it is to heat a bit of oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add your cabbage and cook it for about 8-10 minutes, until it\u2019s good and tender. You can stir it occasionally as you do this to make sure it\u2019s evenly cooked. Then, remove it from the heat and add the pomegranate molasses, vinegar, and sugar. Once you do that, just season it to taste with a bit more vinegar or sugar, as well as salt and pepper. You can make the cabbage while you\u2019re cooking the meat, if you\u2019d like to save time.

You should do this right after you\u2019ve finished preparing the meat so that you can place the meat into a shawarma that is nice and warm. Note that, after you\u2019ve added your meat, tahini sauce, and cabbage to the shawarma, you can cook it, seam side-down, for about 3 minutes in a skillet to get it nice and brown and to seal the ingredients together."
