These are highly drought-tolerant plants after they become established. If the weather is particularly dry, though, they will look better with a good, deep watering once every week or two."

Sprinkle slow-release 10-10-10 fertilizer around the plants when new buds form in mid-winter. A 6- or 9-month slow-release fertilizer should give the Lenton rose all the nutrients it needs."

If the plant is struggling, mix your rose fertilizer at half strength and feed once a season. Rose specific fertilizers are available at most stores"

You can also remove small plants that have formed under the base of the plant. These small plants are new healthy Lenton roses and can either be composted or transplanted further away from the parent plant."

This will improve the plant\u2019s appearance, will help make room for new leaves and will reduce the possibility of bacterial and fungal disease. Throw the leaves in the trash.

In harsher areas, you\u2019ll need to leave some of the leaves surrounding the plant to protect it against harsh winds. If you prefer to leave the evergreen leaves, even in mild winters, this will cause no harm to the plant."

Roses in zones 4 and 5 (where temperatures dip to -30 degrees F and -34.4 degrees C) may need protection during the winter. Consider planting your roses near covered areas and bushes.

          "headline":"Test the pH of your soil.",
          "description":"Alkaline soil with a pH of 7.6 to 8.5 is ideal for Lenton roses. Buy a soil pH test kit at your local garden center and test the pH of your soil. Be sure to use soil that you dig up from 4 inches (10.2 cm) below the surface to get a good sample. Wear gloves while collecting your soil. Touching the sample with your hands could influence the pH. Break up the soil and allow it to dry. Put the dried soil into a clean container. Put distilled water and the chemical that comes in the test kit into the container with the soil. Shake up the container then and then let the soil settle. Check the color of the water in the container against the chart that comes with the kit to determine what the pH of your soil is."

If the soil is sandy, 1 \u00bc pounds of lime will be required to change the pH of 25 square feet of soil from 6.8 to 7.8. Heavy clay soil will require 2 \u00be pounds of lime to make the same change. Work the lime into the soil to a depth of 6 inches (15.2 cm) if the Lenton rose has not already been planted. If it is already growing in the garden, gently work the lime into the top few inches of soil around the plant."

If the Lenton rose has not yet been planted, work a 3- to 6-inch depth of organic matter like well-aged cow manure, compost, sphagnum peat moss or leaf mold into the soil. Work it in thoroughly to a depth of 8 to 10 inches (20.3 to 25.4 cm). If the Lenton rose has already been planted, gently work the organic matter into the top 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) of soil around the rose. Be careful not to damage its roots. The organic matter will improve the texture, fertility and drainage capabilities of the soil."

The plant have at least three inches of topsoil over its roots to help it survive during the winter months. Leave the stem clear when returning the soil to the hole. This will encourage growth while discouraging diseases from affecting your rose."
