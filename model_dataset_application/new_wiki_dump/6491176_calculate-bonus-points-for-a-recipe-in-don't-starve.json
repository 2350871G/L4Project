Most recipes only require a certain amount of items, or the presence of one or two types of food, or a specific ingredient. Twigs and mushrooms (especially the Red Cap mushrooms most commonly found during the day) are the most efficient fillers. Mushrooms are poisonous and carry penalties when consumed uncooked, but will carry none of the poisonous risk when used as an ingredient. Twigs are completely inedible uncooked, but can be used as an ingredient filler. Berries are also a good filler since they\u2019re readily available and renewable, except during winter. They\u2019re also not as filling as other foods, which means they make an excellent filler for cheap meals if you have some to spare."

For instance, if you made a Fistful of Jam with 4 raw berries, you first need to add up the individual value of the berries, which is a total of 37.48 hunger points and no bonuses to sanity and health. Subtract that total from the gains of the dish, which is 37.5 hunger points, 5 sanity, and 3 health. The hunger benefits basically even out, with some bonuses to health and sanity. Using Cooked Berries, which have a hunger value of 12.5, would devalue the dish by 12.5 points, though the dish itself would heal you for 4 points more and restore your sanity by 5 points."
