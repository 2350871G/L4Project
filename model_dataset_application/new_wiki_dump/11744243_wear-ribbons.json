Pick out a ribbon that goes with your outfit and tie it around your ponytail, hiding the hair elastic from view. Create a bow with the ribbon or let the ends flow down through your ponytail. Wear your hair half-up and half-down with a ribbon holding the hair up. Cut the ribbon so that it's at least 14\u201320 inches (36\u201351 cm) long\u2014you can always make it shorter once it's tied, if needed."

After you secure your bun with a hair elastic, tie a ribbon around it and make it into a bow. To make your bow really stand out, choose a thick ribbon. You might skip the bow and just tie a pretty ribbon around your topknot or bun to add some color."

Secure the braid with a hair elastic and tie the ribbon around the end of the braid, covering the elastic. For example, tie thin blue ribbons into bows at the end of your French braids. Ribbons that are on the end of your braids don't need to be as long\u201410\u201312 inches (25\u201330 cm) of length should work."

If you\u2019re worried about the ribbon sliding around, secure it using bobby pins. This is a classic look that\u2019s perfect for keeping your hair back. If you\u2019re wearing your hair down, consider pinning back the front strands with a bobby pin so they stay in place against your head."

If the knot is visible, hold the ribbon in place at the top of the braid with a bobby pin instead, removing the bobby pin once the braid is finished. Group the ribbon in with one of the three strands that you\u2019re braiding so that it looks as if it\u2019s weaving through your hair. Secure the ribbon and braid with a hair elastic once you\u2019re finished. Cut the ribbon so it's at least 4 inches (10 cm) longer than the length of your hair so you have enough to do the braid."
