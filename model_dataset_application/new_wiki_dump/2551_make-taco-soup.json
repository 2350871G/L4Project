Use a wooden spoon to break up the meat into pieces that are equal in size so they\u2019ll cook evenly. Cook for approximately 10 to 15 minutes to ensure that all of the meat is brown, with no traces of pink. Make sure that your skillet is large enough to hold 2 pounds of meat. If the ground beef is crowded in the pan, it may not cook evenly. You can substitute ground turkey for the beef if you prefer."

Keep the skillet on medium-high heat, and saute the mixture for 3 to 5 minutes or until the onion and peppers become tender.

Make sure to stir the contents well so the seasoning is fully incorporated into the beef mixture. If you prefer to use homemade taco seasoning, spoon in approximately 2-3 tablespoons (30-35 g), depending on how spicy you want your soup, in place of the packet."
