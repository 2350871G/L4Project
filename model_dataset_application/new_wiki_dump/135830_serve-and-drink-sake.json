Fill a kettle with water and bring it to a boil. Alternatively, you can fill a saucepan with water and bring it to a boil over medium heat. Some sake varieties are actually served chilled rather than warmed. These varieties, which include ginjo, daiginjo, junmai, and namazake, should be served between 40 \u00b0F (4 \u00b0C) and 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C). Serve these directly from the refrigerator."

If you used a saucepan to boil the water, remove the saucepan from heat and leave the water in the pan."

You can use a thermometer to keep an eye on the sake's temperature as it sits in the hot water. Sake shouldn't be served hot, as this will cause the alcohol to burn off and will ruin the drink's delicate flavors. Sake that's heated should only ever be warmed slightly."
