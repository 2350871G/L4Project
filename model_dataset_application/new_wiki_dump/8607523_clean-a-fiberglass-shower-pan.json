Mix half a cup of baking soda with a few tablespoons of water. Mix the water and baking soda until it develops the consistency of paste. Use all-purpose or bathroom cleaner. Bathroom cleaners and all-purpose cleaners are generally gentle enough for use on fiberglass surfaces, but are sometimes reputed to be unnecessarily expensive. Use a Magic Eraser. Magic Erasers are soft sponges with cleaning solutions inside. They only need to be wet to be used. They are gentle enough for fiberglass and very good at picking up heavy stains. Performing a Light Clean Wet a nonabrasive sponge. Use a sponge made of nylon, polyester, or polyethylene. Other cleaners can be too abrasive for fiberglass. If you are using a Magic Eraser, wet it instead. Apply cleaning solution to the sponge. Depending upon the solution, either spray it on the sponge or dunk the sponge in it.
