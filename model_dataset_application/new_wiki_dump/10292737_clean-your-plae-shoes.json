Apply the solution on the dirt and let it sit for a while. Keep rubbing the stain with a cloth till it disappears completely. You can also make such a solution at home. Add 1 teaspoon of Borax and 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of baking soda to half a cup of hot water. Stir the mixture and place a melamine sponge to soak up the solution. Squeeze out the excess and start cleaning. This method is also effective to remove stains made by permanent markers and biodegradable substances such as grass, blood etc."

Air the shoes with the tongue lifted up in a shaded, dry spot outside or place them under a fan. Soak the insoles in warm water with a few drops of detergent. Use a shoe brush to scrub them clean and then rinse. Clip them onto a clothesline to dry. Make sure the insoles are dry before you put them in. Reduce the odour by placing strips of dryer sheets in each shoe overnight. Wear clean socks with your footwear to avoid staining the insole."
