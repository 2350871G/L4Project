Roots have crowns five to seven inches (13 to 18 cm) in diameter, and tapered taproots. The usable portion of each root is about nine to ten inches (23 to 25 cm). If you don\u2019t want the tops of the plants, they can be added to a compost pile."

Dig them up carefully so that you don\u2019t bruise them, which may lead to rot. Leave the leaves intact. Place the roots side by side in a garden, covered with straw, or in boxes of sand in a cool, dark, frost-free place until needed. \u201dForcing\u201d vegetables is when you move them to an artificial growing environment, such as a greenhouse, to produce a harvest outside of the normal growing season. Chicory roots should never be frozen, since freezing temperatures change the chemical makeup of the roots."

Chicory leaves are edible throughout the growing season, but become more bitter after early spring. However, you can boil them to reduce bitterness.
