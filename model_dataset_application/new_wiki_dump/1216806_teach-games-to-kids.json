There is honestly lots and lots of time to learn \u201cthe right way\" to play the games, but first the kids have to learn to love playing them and get excited to try new games. Play games in front of your kids, and let them sit in your lap, hold your cards, move your pieces, pick a color or roll the dice, even if it\u2019s only  for 2 minutes as their marching band parades through the room. Show them that playing games together is a fun and valuable use of time."

      "description":"Start by getting out all the pieces and taking some time to look them over. The point is to sit with your kids and explore together, so don\u2019t worry about losing pieces...you\u2019ll be right there with them, right? If your kid destroys the pieces or puts things in their mouth, wait a while or invest in some of the high quality wooden games out there that have pieces that are too big to eat and too sturdy to destroy. As you play, try saying things like \u201cWow, dice, what should we do with these?\u201d or ask questions like \u201cWhich side of the card should we use?\u201d or \u201cHow do we get these guys to stand up?\u201d Let the kids be the problem solvers, even if their solutions aren\u2019t what you would normally come up with. It\u2019s okay if they use dice to build towers or are more interested in the backs of the cards than the front. Just remember, if all you do is get a game box out, look at all the pieces with your kid, and put them back in the box, you haven\u2019t failed! You\u2019ve succeeded at starting them down a path of learning to love games."

For example, if you get out Candy Land and your child just wants to match colors, then have fun matching colors with them, and store away that knowledge so that next time you can pull out a matching game like Memory instead."

It\u2019s pretty natural to get excited when your child starts coming up with their own ways to play that are very similar to the \u201creal rules\u201d, but try not to get disappointed if all they want to do is play their own way."

For example, if your child knows how to play Memory and you want to teach them Settlers of Catan, you can play a memory matching game with the pieces. Place all of the hex tiles face down in the shape of the island and take turns turning them over. Whenever you get a match, you collect a resource card of that type. You can use the resource cards to build roads, settlements, cities, and development cards (using the costs on the reference card from the game) and have a goal of being the first one to build one of each, or whatever else sounds fun. That way they are learning that the hex tiles correlate to resources, and that you get sets of resources to build stuff in the game. Then when you introduce the game, those basic concepts will form the foundation. You can go as far as you want with this, depending on your child\u2019s age/skill/interest level/etc. Breaking the game down to its core mechanics will help your kids form a library of \u201cgame rules\u201d that you can use when you are learning new games, and using those mechanics to help teach other games gives kids a chance to practice something they already know in a new context, while establishing new skills. Win-win!"
