Give it at least ten minutes, or wait about half an hour for deep impressions. Vinegar is often used as a cleaning solution, so the area you spray may end up cleaner than the rest of your carpet."

Don\u2019t press too hard or you\u2019ll flatten the carpet out again. It\u2019s important to use a white towel so that you don\u2019t bleed any color onto your carpet."

This will cause the carpet fibers to spring up straight again. If a spoon doesn\u2019t give you the results you hope for, try combing the carpet with the tines of a fork. Also try a brush with stiff but non-metal bristles to even the carpet out when the dent is gone. A boar's hair brush works well."
