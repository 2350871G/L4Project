      "description":"If your decking is 12 feet (3.7 m) x 12 feet (3.7 m) then ensure you buy 14 feet (4.3 m) lengths to reduce cost and waste. You will also need 6\"x2\" lengths for the subframe."

      "description":"If it is spot on then the decking can be laid straight down on top without the need of supports. If it is not level then digging in one area or supporting in another may be necessary. The easiest way to support a deck this size without posts is to dig five holes. One at each corner and one in the middle. These holes can be filled with combinations of sand/shingle and blocks, or with concrete. Take into consideration the soils integrity when choosing a method. If your soil is solid then two blocks, sand and shingle may suffice. If your soil is bad then maybe consider a slightly larger hole filled in with concrete. Decking with posts and handrail can be supported by digging holes, placing the posts in plumb and filling with concrete. Remember that your deck needs to be off level slightly to allow rainwater to flow off its edge. Water flow should move the same direction as the decking surface. Supporting blocks or infills can be levelled with a straight edge and a level sitting on top."

If you don't like this method then screw it flush. Allow a constant gap of 3mm-8mm for expansion between the boards as they will absorb water in the winter and dry out and shrink in the summer. Failure to do this will result in the boards lifting, splitting and not drying out. This will lead to rotting and a very short life expectancy."
