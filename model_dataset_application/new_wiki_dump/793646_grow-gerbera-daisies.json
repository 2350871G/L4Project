To give the seedlings a head start, you can start the seeds inside before that so they\u2019ll be ready for transplanting in late spring or early summer.

Because of this, it\u2019s important to keep them out of the hot afternoon sun.

You can help improve soil drainage by tilling 2 inches (5.1 cm) of compost into the garden bed before planting. This will also enrich the soil and encourage better blooms. Instead of compost, you can use peat or some other organic material. In areas with soil that has a very high clay content, consider amending the soil with sand as well to improve drainage.

This will encourage the plant to grow more flowers. To keep from having to remove spent blooms, you can instead cut blooms when they\u2019re fresh and bring them indoors. If you keep the flowers in water, they should last for several days."
