Larger traps are used to catch larger animals. Visit a large hardware store or sporting goods store, and ask to peruse the traps selection. As a rough rule of thumb, use each trap for the following animals:\n110: small mammals like mink and muskrat. 220: medium mammals like raccoon and opossum. 330: larger mammals like otter or beaver."

          "description":"Conibear traps are hefty and would take an extreme amount of strength to set by hand. Trap companies also provide setters: a metal tool that allows you to exert many pounds of pressure on the trap's springs without hurting yourself. The setter looks almost like a pair of garden shears without the blades. You can purchase a setter wherever conibear traps are sold. If the setters aren't apparent, ask the sales staff to help you find the item. Without a setter, you may be able to set a 110 by hand (if you have strong hands), but you'd be unable to bend the springs on the large 220 or 330."

          "description":"Beaver slides are the muddy, well-worn tracks that beavers use to climb out of ponds and up onto dry ground. Slides are an ideal location to place the conibear trap, since you can be certain that any beavers in the vicinity will use the slides to access water. You do not need to set the trap at the exact location where you plan to trap animals. As long as you do not release the J-hooks before you've placed the trap in the intended position, it won't go off accidentally. Try setting the conibear trap right at the mouth of the beaver slide. If a few fruitless days pass, move the conibear trap back farther away from the water. Raccoons often hunt for and wash off their food near water as well. If you're trapping raccoon, try setting the conibear near a beaver slide, on an open bank of a river or lake."

          "description":"Beavers use channels\u2014also called runs\u2014to swim back and forth through swampy, flooded wetlands. Since these channels are submerged, beavers will swim through them quickly, not suspecting a trap in the water way. You can easily identify a beaver channel: each channel will be 12\u201316 inches (30\u201341 cm) wide. When you're ready to trap, just lower the conibear trap into the channel. Be careful not to accidentally bump the trigger and set the trap off as you set it in place. If you're hunting other aquatic mammals, like muskrat, mink, or otters, you can place the conibear trap in their underwater channels or on riverbank trails. These passageways will be smaller than beaver channels, but should be just as noticeable."
