Only transfer the outlines of the main elements and a few loose marks to place features on a portrait. You'll do the details at the end of the painting. Set out all your sketches and any photo references within sight of your painting area. If you have a live model, you can continue working from these sources during breaks. If not, you'll need to work entirely from these and your memory."
