If you have a bold retro color, you will probably need to prime the walls before you can apply a new color. If you are only trying to update faded white or off-white walls\u2014including walls stained with tobacco smoke\u2014primer may not be necessary. You can go with pure white to give your kitchen a fresh, modern feeling, or you can opt for a light blue to add a calm, refreshing dose of tranquility. Beige is also an acceptable color, especially if you have wood cabinets or countertops. Use satin or semigloss latex paint for your walls. These two types of paint are easier to scrub, which is important in a greasy room like the kitchen."
