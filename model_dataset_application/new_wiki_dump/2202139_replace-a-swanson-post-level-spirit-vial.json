At the same time, exert a slight downward force to push the Tab part of the way out of the slot itself. Use your hand holding the Retainer to prevent the Retainer Tab from resetting itself.

Use adhesive sparingly to assure the new Vial is seated firmly and cannot move. Adhesive may not be required unless the Retainer has been damaged and doesn't properly secure the Vial. Use a MILD adhesive (Do Not Use \"super-glue\", etc.) Place a small dab into the Vial Seat before setting the Vial and the Retainer.
