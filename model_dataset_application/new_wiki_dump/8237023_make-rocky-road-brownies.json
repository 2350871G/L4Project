Set the oven temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat. Keep an eye on your oven so you know when it\u2019s preheated.

Stir the mixture thoroughly to ensure that the ingredients are fully blended. You can substitute melted butter for the margarine if you prefer.

Mix well until all of the ingredients are fully incorporated. You may want to break the eggs into a separate bowl and beat them slightly before adding them to the cocoa powder mixture. That way, you won\u2019t have to worry about ruining all of the batter with a bad egg and it will be easier to mix the eggs the other ingredients."

Stir well to ensure that the flour is fully blended into the batter. It\u2019s often better to add the flour to the batter a little at a time.

Adding nuts to the batter is optional. There will be nuts in the rocky road topping, so you may not necessarily want to add them to the brownies themselves too. Walnuts are usually used in brownies, but you can use any nut that you like, including pecans and almonds."
