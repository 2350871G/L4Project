Hold the mounting clip in the desired location (the tubing lengths provided in these instructions apply when the pump is mounted on the front/left of the RO manifold) and use a permanent marker to mark the hole locations. The mounting clip should have included mounting screws. Use the appropriate sized drill bit to drill the holes in the manifold.
