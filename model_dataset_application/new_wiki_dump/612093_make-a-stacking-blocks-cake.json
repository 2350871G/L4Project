  "text":" Baking the Cake Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Mix the wet ingredients in a medium mixing bowl. Put the butter, sugar, vanilla, eggs, and milk in a bowl. Beat with a whisk or an electric mixer until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Mix in the flour. Slowly add the flour to the wet ingredient mixture, stirring it in well with a whisk or electric mixer. Keep beating the mixture until you no longer see specks of white flour. Pour the batter into a greased rectangular pan. Use butter or cooking spray to oil a 13\" x 9\" pan and pour the batter into it. Bake the cake. Put the pan in the oven and bake the cake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Let the cake cool for 10 minutes.  Invert the cake onto a tray. Allow it to finish cooling completely while you make the icing. Making the Icing Beat the icing ingredients in a medium mixing bowl. Beat the confectioners' sugar, butter, milk, and vanilla until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Add more sugar if it's too runny, or more milk if it's too stiff. Divide the frosting into four bowls. Put equal amounts of frosting into each bowl. Add food coloring to the bowls. Squirt a few drops of red food coloring into the first bowl, blue into the second, green into the third, and yellow into the fourth. Stir each bowl of frosting and add more coloring until you're happy with the colors. If you want to make unique colors, mix two types of food coloring in one bowl of frosting. You could mix yellow and red to make orange, for example. Gel food coloring tends to create brighter colors than liquid food coloring. Decorating the Cake Cut the cooled cake into squares and rectangles. You can cut the cake into half or thirds for a start and use creativity on how small you want the pieces to be. Each piece represents a block. Arrange the cake blocks on a large tray. Make them look like stacking blocks that have been dropped on the tray; they don't have to line up perfectly! Frost the cake blocks. Choose a different color for each cake block. Use a frosting knife to spread a thin layer of frosting to cover each block. Place the tray of blocks in the refrigerator while you prepare the marshmallows. Cut each marshmallow in half. The marshmallow halves will make up the nodes on the blocks. Make enough marshmallow halves so that the square cake pieces each get 4 halves, the big rectangles get 6, and the small rectangles get 2. Add the marshmallow half to the blocks. Remove the cake blocks from the refrigerator. Take a marshmallow half and spread a thin layer of icing coordinated with the frosting color of the cake block you're decorating. For example, if you're working with a cake block you frosted in blue, use blue frosting on the marshmallow half. Continuing in this way, place the marshmallow halves in even rows on the cake blocks so that each block has the correct number of halves. Finish frosting the cake. Use the rest of the frosting to spread another layer over the cake blocks, this time covering the marshmallows as well. Continue until all of the cake blocks have been neatly frosted. Place the finished cake in the refrigerator until ready to serve.  Finished. ",
