Many gamers are very interested in the martial arts, but never study it. Take up some sort of martial art that is similar to your character in FFXI. For example, if you use a sword in the game, then take up fencing, Kendo, or SCA fighting. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/05\\/Break-a-Final-Fantasy-XI-Addiction-Step-3Bullet1-Version-2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Break-a-Final-Fantasy-XI-Addiction-Step-3Bullet1-Version-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/05\\/Break-a-Final-Fantasy-XI-Addiction-Step-3Bullet1-Version-2.jpg\\/aid208005-v4-728px-Break-a-Final-Fantasy-XI-Addiction-Step-3Bullet1-Version-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":288,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"455\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nTry Reading.
