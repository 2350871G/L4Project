For one thing, high school will help you learn basic math, as well as other concepts that can help you in your profession. Additionally, you may choose to go to culinary school to get a leg up in your field, and you\u2019ll need a high school diploma to do that. Though it may not be worth it for you to go back to high school to become a baker, if you\u2019re still in high school, you should finish the course.

These programs typically last from 1 to 2 years and they will give you an education in nutrition, health, and mathematics, among other relevant subjects. If this sounds like the best path for you, look into programs in your area that offer a reasonable financial package and take your studies seriously. You shouldn\u2019t look at this experience as slowing you down from being a real baker. You can even begin working as an apprentice or trainee in your area while being in school, if you can make the time commitment for both.

This training typically takes 1-3 years, and you may be able to find an apprenticeship for aspiring bakers at a bakery in your area. Of course, it always helps to have some connections, or to have worked at a bakery or local store in some capacity so you have a leg up when looking for work as a baker. It\u2019s common for bakers to start out as an apprentice or a trainee in a bakery or grocery store, working on learning the basics of baking, icing, and decorating. As you work as an apprentice or trainee, you\u2019ll also learn topics such as basic sanitation procedures and nutrition. If you begin your training or apprenticeship in a manufacturing facility, then you will also learn how to operate industrial-sized blending and mixing machines for producing baked goods. You can also look into becoming a baker\u2019s assistant if you have the experience and determination to do so.

          "description":"Though you don\u2019t need to make this decision as soon as you begin your training or apprenticeship, it helps to have an idea of the type of baking you\u2019re most interested in. You can be an in-store, plant, or craft baker. Being a craft baker requires the most skill, and you can also work your way up to becoming successful in this field by starting off at a store or a plant. Here\u2019s what else you should know about choosing what type of baker you want to be:\nPlant or commercial bakers most often work in manufacturing facilities that make baked goods at high speeds. If you choose this route, you\u2019ll need to learn to use high-volume industrial machines, ovens, and conveyors, and you must carefully follow instructions and schedules. There\u2019s definitely less room for creativity in commercial baking than in craft baking. In store or retail bakers most commonly work in specialty shops, bakeries, or grocery stores. They produce a smaller volume of baked goods for people to buy or to eat directly in the store. They may even take orders from customer, prepare special-order goods, and, depending on where they work, they may even serve the customers themselves. Some retail bakers even own their own shops. In this case, they\u2019ll need to not only make a variety of breads, pastries, pies, and cupcakes, but they\u2019ll also have to hire, train, and supervise staff, as well as budget their supplies, set their prices, and manage daily production."

It can help you catch the attention of bakeries where you want to work, and it can help you stand out from the rest of the candidates. There are different areas of specialization that you can get certified in, which include management, retail sales, baking sanitation, and staff training. To become certified, you must meet a series of requirements, which are based on both your experience and your education, before taking an exam to prove your competence. There are different levels of certification based on your level of experience. For example, to be a certified journey baker, you don\u2019t need any formal education, but you do need 1 year of work experience. To be a certified baker, you need to have 4 years of work experience, and to call yourself a certified master baker, you\u2019ll need 8 years of work experience, along with 30 hours of professional development training and 30 hours of sanitation coursework."

One way to make it easier for yourself to perform well in a time crunch is to make sure that your work station and recipe information are organized. That way, you won\u2019t waste time looking for something you misplaced.
