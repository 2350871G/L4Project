Hold your arm high so it spreads out evenly. Different meals require different amounts of salt, so add it in small doses to avoid overpowering the dish. If the meal becomes too salty, build up the original flavor so the ingredients balance out and some of the salt is absorbed. For soup, try adding broth. For meat, potatoes, and similar dishes, try adding a small amount of unsalted butter or cream."
