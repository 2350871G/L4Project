          "description":"You want to pull this as taut as possible. It depends on whether you've already tied it to a package, or whether you're going to do that after you've curled the ribbon. It's easier to tie the ribbon on the package and then curl it, because then you only have to grip it on one end. Otherwise you have to tape down one end to hold it in place. If you're right handed, place the ribbon in your left hand, and vice versa if you're left handed."

Fabric ribbons that you've taken the time to curl can add something a little extra to a nice package. Find a dowel stick (pencil or rod works, too) which you'll use to curl the ribbon around. A bigger diameter creates a bigger curl, while a smaller diameter creates a smaller curl. Get a length of fabric ribbon. The width doesn't particularly matter, it just depends on what you want in terms of width. Make it a few inches (or centimeters) longer than the final desired length because curling will make it smaller. Mix cornstarch and water in a spray bottle. Grab a couple clothespins or clips, or use tape."

When it curls it is smaller than what you started with so always cut off a bit more than you think you need. Grab some wooden dowels or skewers to wind the ribbons around.
