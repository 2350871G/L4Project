People always look closely at a bathroom floor because it shouts hygiene (or lack of it). Therefore, it pays to have it present in the best way possible. If your bathroom has a wood floor, rent a sander for the weekend and refurbish the floor. After sanding, apply 2 or 3 thin coats of varnish; your floor will look brand new. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/9f\\/Remodel-Your-Bathroom-on-a-Budget-Step-7Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-459px-Remodel-Your-Bathroom-on-a-Budget-Step-7Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/9f\\/Remodel-Your-Bathroom-on-a-Budget-Step-7Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-759px-Remodel-Your-Bathroom-on-a-Budget-Step-7Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":334,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":552.2527472527472,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nIf your floor has one or more layers of old linoleum, you can remove the linoleum (using a sharp utility knife) and either refinish the wood floor underneath, or replace the linoleum with inexpensive vinyl tiles. For tiling, see above. Number one rule\u2013\u2013always remove carpet from a bathroom, especially if you're selling the place. While it was fashionable some decades ago to carpet bathrooms, it's never appealing to buyers due to the moisture and mildew factor, as well as the presentation. Tiles or wood flooring make far better options for the floor of a bathroom. Accessorize. Replace all your towels, curtains and rugs. Buy a new shower curtain and curtain rings. You can purchase everything separately, or shop for coordinating sets. Add a few pictures or plaques on the wall (but don't overdo it). Buy a new hamper and wastebasket. An assortment of new accessories can uplift the look of your bathroom even if you don\u2019t touch the walls and floor.",
