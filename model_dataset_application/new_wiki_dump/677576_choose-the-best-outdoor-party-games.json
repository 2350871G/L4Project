You can play this the usual way (splitting the group into teams and letting them throw balls made of sponge at each other) or by making one person the thrower (and whoever the thrower hits with a ball replaces them as the thrower). You can adapt this so that if someone is made a thrower more than twice, they become a permanent thrower. Ensure you have a sufficient number of balls made of sponge (about the size of a soccer ball); five should be enough."
