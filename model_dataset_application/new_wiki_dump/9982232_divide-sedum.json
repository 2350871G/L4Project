  "text":" Digging up Your Sedum Dig up sedum in early spring. Since sedum blooms in late summer and fall, the plant should be dug up and divided in early spring. You can begin digging as soon as new growth appears in the spring. Divide your sedum every 3 to 4 years to control size and maintain health.

Once the plant\u2019s roots are detached from the soil, push your spade underneath the plant and pull it out of the ground. Place the sedum plant on the ground nearby. Cutting the Sedum Plant Choose how many divisions to make. The size of your sedum plant will determine how many divisions you can make. Between 2 and 8 divisions are common, depending on if your plant is small or large. Use a flat spade to divide large clumps into smaller clusters. Using a sharp, flat spade, begin dividing your sedum. Make clean cuts with your spade all the way through the plant. Try to keep sections a similar size.
