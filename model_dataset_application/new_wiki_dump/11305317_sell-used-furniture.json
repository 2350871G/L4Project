          "headline":"Take 70 percent off the original price you paid.",
          "description":"While it depends on the quality, size, and condition, taking 70% off of what you paid is a good baseline for used furniture if you\u2019ve owned it for more than a year. Furniture can typically be pretty hard to sell for more than 30% of its original value unless it\u2019s an antique or specialty item, so be ready to wait out or negotiate if you set your base price higher.Tip: Since furniture tends to last for a while, buyers and sellers don\u2019t usually get too focused on how long it\u2019s been owned if it\u2019s more than a year. It\u2019s not like a car where every year that it has been owned causes it to radically depreciate. For example, if you paid $1100 for a dining table, subtract $770. This gives you a baseline of $330. If you\u2019ve owned the furniture for less than a year you can try starting off at half of what you originally paid. Highlight the amount of time that you\u2019ve owned it in any ads you post."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Raise or lower the price another 10% based on the piece\u2019s condition.",
          "description":"If the item you\u2019re selling is in absolutely pristine condition, go ahead and tack on another 10% to your base price. If it\u2019s been kind of beat up and neglected over the years, you need to lower the price at least another 10%. Missing or broken pieces could require additional cuts to the base price. For example, if the $1100 dining table is in pristine condition, you\u2019d add another 110 to the base price of $330 to get $440. If it\u2019s been scratched, is missing a screw, or needs to be refinished, subtract at least $110 to land around $220."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Lower the price another 10-20% if the item is bigger and hard to move.",
          "description":"If someone is going to come pick up a giant 400 lb (180 kg) dresser, they\u2019ll probably need to rent a truck, ask a friend to help move it, and be willing to put in some work. The additional labor and energy required to move bigger pieces makes the market less competitive for larger items. Take 10-20% off of your price if you have a particularly massive bed frame, dresser, couch, or dining table. This is especially true if you\u2019re selling the furniture privately. If you\u2019re taking it to a resale shop, this doesn\u2019t matter quite as much. However, this doesn\u2019t apply to antique pieces where the buyer is likely hiring special movers regardless of the size of the piece. For example, if the $1100 dining table is in pristine condition and seats 4 people, you can add a total of 220 to the base price of 330 to reach a price of $550. If it is kind of beat up, weighs 250 lb (110 kg), and seats 8-10, you need to subtract around 220 from the price to reach $110."

          "headline":"Compare your furniture to similar pieces being sold online near you.",
          "description":"Used furniture being sold online offers a good snapshot of what people are willing to pay in your area. Look for similar pieces online to see if there are a lot of similar items available in your area by checking https://craigslist.org/. Note the prices listed for similar pieces to get a sense of whether your base price is fair or not. If there\u2019s a lot of inventory being sold in your area, you may need to lower your price to get more competitive. For example, if you\u2019re selling a shoe rack and you don\u2019t see any other shoe racks listed online, go ahead and add $20-50 to your base price. If there are tons of shoe racks for sale though, you probably need to take some money off of your base price to reach the market\u2019s level. You can use http://www.statricks.com/ to generate an average price based on online sales."

          "headline":"Be willing to cut another 10% for cloth items that you sit or lay on.",
          "description":"Chairs, recliners, mattresses, and sofas are really hard to sell if they\u2019re made of cloth, velvet, cotton, or any other kind of fabric. This is because these fabrics tend to absorb sweat, odors, and fluids. Buyers know this. Take another 10% off for cloth items. It\u2019s typically much easier to sell items that are entirely made of wood or metal. Used mattresses are really difficult to sell if they aren\u2019t in absolutely pristine condition."

          "description":"Unless you know who designed and crafted a particular piece, it will be extremely difficult for you to price an antique piece of furniture on your own. Contact an antique appraisal service in your area to see if they can inspect your piece to get a good sense for what it\u2019s worth. Many antique appraisal services will offer to buy or sell your piece for you. This can make things easier for you if you just want to get rid of it. You typically need to pay a small fee to get a piece appraised. It\u2019s usually more effective to sell antique furniture with a consignment shop that specializes in antiques, since they have access to a higher-end client base."

Open the blinds or drapes on your windows to let in some natural light and turn on additional lights if necessary. Take multiple photos from a variety of angles to make it easy to see each side of the furniture. You should always include photos when selling furniture online to appeal to the highest number of buyers possible. Natural light will always look better than overhead lighting. If you need additional lighting, try turning on table lamps and standing lamps first. If you know how to clean, crop, and edit photos, feel free to go ahead and touch your photos up. It\u2019s not mandatory though."

You also need to include the dimensions so that people know how big the furniture is. Decide on a payment method and shipping/delivery requirements. If you\u2019re selling the furniture locally, consider offering to drop the furniture off for an additional fee. Shipping is really expensive for heavier items. This isn\u2019t really a viable option for tables, couches, or bed frames unless you\u2019re selling them for more than $1000. If you\u2019re selling on Etsy or eBay, you don\u2019t need to worry about payment methods.

A garage sale can be a healthy choice if your garage is piling up with other stuff you need to get rid of. Take antique furniture to an antique dealer for an accurate price. The only real option for selling antique furniture without losing out on a lot of money is to take it to an antique dealer or consignment shop. Contact an antique shop in your area, ask them for an appraisal, and then ask what they\u2019d be willing to purchase it for. Some antique shops function like consignment shops and will try to sell your piece for you. While you may fetch a good price for your piece online, an antique shop is going to give you a more accurate price. You can perform a search for an appraiser or dealer at http://www.antiques.com/. Donating Your Furniture Consider donating to a charitable organization for tax purposes. If you find it really difficult to get rid of your furniture for a price that\u2019s worth your while, consider donating it. Depending on where you live, you could write it off on your taxes, which can save you money. Search online to see what charities in your area will pick your furniture up and contact them. Vietnam Veterans of America, Habitat for Humanity, and Goodwill will all pick up furniture from your home. Make sure that you get a receipt if you plan on writing it off on your taxes. Unfortunately, it\u2019s pretty tough to sell used furniture. There\u2019s a high chance that you\u2019ll struggle to sell your piece. Donating is a good alternative! Contact local schools and nursing homes to see if they need furniture. Schools and nursing homes often operate on shoestring budgets, and they may be able to use your furniture. Call your local institutions to see if they\u2019re interested. They\u2019ll probably offer to pick it up as well if they really need it. It\u2019s unlikely that schools or nursing homes will take any cloth materials. Bed bugs and lice are disastrous in nursing homes and schools, and they can both live in cloth furniture. Stick it on the curb with a \u201cfree\u201d sign and let someone come pick it up. If you live in an area where people often leave goods out on the curb for others to take, you can always leave the furniture out on the curb. Put a sign on it that says \u201cfree,\u201d and wait for someone to come pick it up. Check the weather before putting the furniture out to ensure that it isn\u2019t supposed to rain or snow for the next 24 hours. You can post a \u201ccurb alert\u201d in the free section of Craigslist to let people know that you\u2019re giving it away. In some areas, it is illegal to dump furniture on the curb. Even if you\u2019ve seen other people do it, you should contact your local council member, mayor\u2019s office, or alderman to see if it\u2019s allowed in your area.",
