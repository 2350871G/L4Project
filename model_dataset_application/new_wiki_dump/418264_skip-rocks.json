Keep looking for rocks until you collect 10 or more so you don't have to look for new ones after each throw. Bring rocks that you find around your home if you're worried about looking for rocks near the water. Experiment with different thicknesses and weights to see what kind of rock works best for you.Tip: Opt for a triangular stone if you can find one. Flat triangular rocks are more stable than perfectly round rocks."

          "description":"Bend your knees as you move your dominant arm in front of your body. Flick your wrist at the end of your throw and let go of the rock so it spins off your index finger and lands parallel to the water. The spinning will help the rock bounce off the water's surface so it skips multiple times. Rocks skip across the water because they form a cavity when they first impact the surface. The flat bottom of the rock rides along the angle of the cavity, sending it airborne again so it can skip. Don't try and throw hard. Instead, try to throw your arm quickly. If your rock doesn't skip the first time you try, take your time to readjust your form and try again. Practice makes perfect!Tip: Try shifting your weight onto your back foot on your backswing, and then back to your front foot when you throw the rock. This can add more power to your throw, similar to a baseball pitch."

  "text":" Finding the Right Location and Rock Go to a large body of water when the weather is calm. Visit a pond or lake at a time when there are no waves.
