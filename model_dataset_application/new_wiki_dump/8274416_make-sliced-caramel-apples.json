          "description":"Place a small saucepan filled with a few inches of water on the stove. Place a glass mixing bowl into the saucepan. It should fit snugly, but shouldn't touch the water. Heat the water till it starts to simmer (bubble lightly). Add 1 cup (175 g) of semi-sweet chocolate chips and stir the chocolate until it melts. Stir in 1 tablespoon of coconut oil. The coconut oil will help the chocolate remain shiny once it's cooled. It will also help it harden on the sliced apples. You could also melt the chocolate and coconut oil in the microwave. Just microwave on the lowest setting for 30 seconds at a time. Stir the chips frequently until they're melted."

          "description":"Wash 2 large apples and carefully slice them into 1/2\u201d to 3/4\u201d slices. Take a small knife and make a small notch at the bottom of each slice so you can easily insert the stick. Push one popsicle stick into each apple slice. To ensure that the chocolate coats and sticks to the apples, consider patting them dry with a paper towel."

          "headline":"Dip the apple slices in the chocolate and chill them.",
          "description":"Lay a piece of waxed paper onto a large baking sheet. Spray the wax with cooking or baking spray. Pour a little of the melted chocolate onto a small rimmed plate. Dip both sides of each apple slice into the chocolate so the slice is completely coated. Set the slices on the prepared baking sheet. Refrigerate the apples for 5 to 10 minutes so the chocolate hardens. If you don't have waxed paper, you could also lay a silicone baking mat on the baking sheet."

          "headline":"Drizzle the apple slices with caramel.",
          "description":"Remove the baking sheet of chilled apples from the fridge. If the caramel sauce is in a squeeze bottle, just squeeze the caramel sauce over the apple slices. If the caramel sauce is in a jar, dip a spoon in the caramel and drizzle it over the apples. You can also drizzle melted white chocolate over the apple slices for an even sweeter flavor. Chill the apple slices for another 5 minutes. To melt the white chocolate, you could microwave white chocolate chips in 30 second intervals. Or purchase a white chocolate sauce. Just ensure that cocoa butter is listed as an ingredient."

Slice the apples into wedges (about eight per apple). Choose an apple variety that you enjoy eating. Try Honeycrisp, Pink Lady, Granny Smith, or Jonagold."

Pat the apples dry and use them or refrigerate them for a few days. The saltwater soak prevents the apples from browning, so you can make caramel apple wedges in advance."

          "description":"Set a heavy-bottomed saucepan on the stove and add 3/4 cup (180 ml) of the heavy cream, 3/4 cup (225 g) of dark corn syrup, 1/2 cup (115 g) of unsalted butter (cut into pieces), and 1 cup of (225 g) of sugar. Stir the ingredients to combine them and heat the pan over high heat until the mixture melts and reaches 244 to 248 degrees F (117 to 120 C). To accurately check the temperature, you can attach a candy thermometer to the inside of the saucepan. Just ensure that the tip of the thermometer doesn't touch the bottom of the pan."

          "headline":"Check the color of the caramel and the remaining caramel ingredients.",
          "description":"Carefully dip a spoon into the caramel to see how dark the color is. The caramel should be a dark amber color. If it is, remove it from the heat (or cook it longer if it's too pale). Pour in the remaining 1/4 cup (60 ml) of heavy cream and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Hold the handle of the saucepan and swirl it to combine the ingredients. If you like a softer caramel, don't cook it the caramel soft too long. Let it get to a light brown color and remove it from the heat."

Or you could lay the apple wedges on a serving plate and drizzle the caramel sauce over the apples. Serve the apples immediately once you've drizzled them with caramel. For an extra crunch touch, sprinkle the drizzled caramel apple wedges with 1/4 cup (30 g) of chopped salted and roasted peanuts."
