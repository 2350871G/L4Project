Continue this way until you have the entire rope going back and forth across your shoulders and arms and looping through your hands each time. Be sure to leave at least two feet of slack.

Pull the coils off your shoulders, holding them together so you don't drop any strands of rope. Bring your hands together, take the two bundles of rope, and put them together in one big loop. You should be holding a loose coil in one hand: an upside down U shape of all your rope with loops on the ends of the U.

You should be able to just hold the whole bundle by the slack now. The bottom of the coil may look a bit untidy but that doesn't matter as long as the top is tight and orderly."

      "description":"Leave yourself approximately three feet of rope, and let whichever hand is holding the U-shape grab the remaining end. Let go of the bundle, and pull the end through at the same time, without letting go with the other hand. Bring the end of the rope through its own loop at the top of the bundle, creating a half hitch around the top of the bundle. Reach through the hole you left, between the \"top\" of the folded coil bundle and the wraps you just made. Grasp the trailing sections of rope near the bundle and pull them both partway through the hole, creating a loop. Feed the slack around the big loop a few times, bundling it all together so it looks like a really thick noose. Wrap it at least five times, but probably no more than ten. It is up to you how much you want to wrap, and if you need more room, unwind the end in the loop to give you more room. Take a loop of the slack and put it through the noose's loop; feed the rest of the slack through its own loop, crochet-stitch style."

Slide it into your backpack or a stuff sack, or hanging it from your harness. Make sure that the rope is secure."

    {
      "headline":"Consider making a rope backpack.",
      "description":"If you leave a longer tail of slack, you can make a pseudo-backpack with the rope ends tied back into the bundle. This may make for easier carrying if an actual backpack in unavailable, or if you want to put your climbing partner to work. Swing the whole thing onto your back and take the two pieces of slack and put one over each shoulder, then cross them across your chest. Put them under your arms and then around the back of the coil on your back, then back out around your waist. Tie a square knot to keep the coil in place. This is especially useful if the rope gets damp from snow. Never climb when it is raining, or has rained! Rock is more likely to break if it is wet, because it has all the extra weight from the water. If you have all the gear in your pack (crampons, backup rope, shoes, anchors, belay devices, carabiners, quick-draws, and trad gear) your partner can just sling the rope on his/her back, and off you go!"
