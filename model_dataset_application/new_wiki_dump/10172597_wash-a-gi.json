          "description":"If you have particularly stubborn stains, you can try soaking them before running your gi through the regular wash cycle. The water temperature you use for presoaking depends on the type of stain. Generally, protein-based stains such as blood or water-based paint should be soaked in cold water. Dirt, mud, and grass stains tend to respond better to warm or hot water. Depending on the type of stain, you may choose to add a stain treatment such as non-chlorine bleach to the water before you place your gi in the water to soak. Check the label of the product to make sure you\u2019ve got the right kind of stain fighter, and always follow the instructions on the product label. Your washing machine may have a \u201csoak\u201d cycle you can use for presoaking your gi. Many washers, especially front-loaders, don\u2019t have a \u201csoak\u201d cycle. If your machine does not have a \u201csoak\u201d cycle, try letting the machine fill up with water and then stop the cycle temporarily. You can also use a large plastic bucket or even a bathtub to presoak your gi."

You can also use a large plastic bucket or even a bathtub to presoak your gi. Running Your Gi through the Wash Cycle Select the cold water setting on your washing machine. Hot or warm water could cause your gi to shrink. If there is no cold water setting on your washer, choose the coolest water temperature available. The jacket of your gi may have a stiff collar with rubber inside. Hot water might cause the rubber inside the collar to become misshapen. Add any odor-neutralizing agents to the water.

Avoid fabric softener, which is added after the rinse cycle and can cause an undesirable residue to remain in the material of your gi. This residue can make clothing less absorbent and prevent it from wicking away moisture. It can also extend the drying time for your gi. Air-Drying the Gi Hang the gi up to dry. Hang your gi on a clothes line or freestanding indoor drying rack, if possible. You could also use an airing cupboard (also called a \u201cboiler cupboard\u201d or \u201chot press\u201d) or a drying cabinet. Avoid drying your clothes in a damp area. Although air-drying is gentler on your gi than tumble-drying, persistent dampness can encourage the growth of mildew on your gi. If you use a drying cabinet, select the lowest heat setting possible.
