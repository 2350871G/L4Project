The fun and creative part about sprinkles is that they go well with nearly every ice cream flavor out there since sprinkles are just color strands of sugar. Feel free to top off sprinkles on your next bowl of ice cream, no matter what the flavor is. Add nuts on the ice cream. Pecans, cashews, pistachios, peanuts, almonds, pine nuts, and walnuts all make great nuts to serve onto ice cream. Nuts are slightly salty and crunchy, making it the perfect kick into your ice cream. The nuts can be added into the ice cream as whole, or they can be chopped into tiny pieces. You can also add chocolate-coated nuts into the ice cream for a chocolaty twist. Garnish the ice cream with cereal. Dry breakfast cereal such as Lucky Charms, Rice Krispies, Cheerios, Mini Wheats, Fruit Pebbles, and cornflakes all make good topping for ice cream. The cereal is crunchy and sweet, making a good combination with the ice cream. Drizzle sauces over the ice cream. Sweet sauces such as strawberry, coconut, pineapple, chocolate, and peanut butter all make tasty toppings for your ice cream. Drizzle about a tablespoon of your favorite sauce over the ice cream for a tasty sweetness boost to your ice cream. Add whipped cream on the ice cream. Whipped cream is a cream that is beaten and whisked until light and fluffy, usually combined with sugar and vanilla for a sweeter taste. Topped and served with ice cream, it can make an incredible dessert that is absolutely delicious to devour up.",
