If you have to store the vodka bottle on its side, it's more likely to leak so think about storing it somewhere else. If your bottle of vodka is stopped with a cork, it's even more important to store it upright. If the vodka is on its side and comes into contact with the cork for a long time, the alcohol can slowly eat away at the cork and cause your bottle to leak."

          "description":"Regardless of if you're storing the vodka for short-term or long-term use, you should store it at a consistent temperature. The temperature shouldn't fluctuate throughout the day from hot to cold. Instead, aim for a constant temperature of 60 to 65\u00b0F unless you want to store it in the freezer. If you want to store the vodka for the long term, the basement is a good choice (unless it's right next to a boiler). Avoid storing in extremely hot areas like attics."

You can store vodka in your freezer if you'd like chilled vodka for drinks. However, freezing the vodka may cause it to seem thicker, though the flavor shouldn't be affected. Vodka that's been chilled and slightly thickens may actually be better for drinking since it fully coats your mouth."

Not only will sunlight speed up evaporation once the bottle is opened, but it can change the taste of the vodka if it's stored in sunlight for a very long time. For the best storage, keep your vodka in a dark place. If you're storing your vodka (and any other liquors or wine) in a dark place, make sure you have good lighting when you need it. This way, you'll be able to turn on the light and see your collection. If you have to store the bottle in some sunlight, wrap the bottle in black cloth. This will minimize the amount of light reaching the vodka."

The new bottle should be small enough that the rest of the vodka fills the bottle and leaves very little room for air in the bottle. If you continue to store small amounts of vodka in a large and mostly empty bottle of vodka, the vodka is exposed to more and more air.

Just be sure to use the vodka or remove it within 3 days since prolonged exposure to the metal in the flask can make your vodka taste metallic. When you've emptied the vodka, rinse out your flask and let it air dry."

It's a good idea to clean through your entire liquor cabinet every 6 months or so. This will encourage you to use up alcohol that has a limited shelf life or throw out alcohol that's no longer good.

To prevent accidents, keep alcohol in a high up place and lock the storage container or liquor cabinet. Even if you trust your older children, locking the liquor cabinet is a good idea.
