If the ground is too soft, use hardcore to firm up. If you have soft ground, consider using a steel mesh to reinforce the concrete.  Install a damp proof membrane if the site where you are erecting the base is prone to damp. Make sure the membrane is added to the whole of the base to avoid cracking. If you are installing the base adjacent to a wall, use damp proof between the concrete and the wall, otherwise damp may transfer.  The Shuttering Set up your shuttering at least one or two days prior to pouring the concrete.  Make sure the shuttering is securely pinned in place with time stakes.  Walk on your shuttering and make sure it is absolutely solid, and doesn\u2019t move.  Use a strong timber that will remain straight and not bow.

Check that the shuttering is completely flat, level, square and over sized \u2013 about 150mm longer and wider to allow for any discrepancies.  Make a removable door within the shuttering, so that you can get access to the area with your wheelbarrow holding the concrete.  \"The concrete pour\"  Before you order the concrete, make sure your site is fully prepared.  Ensure you have a rake, tamp, shovel, float, spirit level, gloves, wellington boots, hose pipe and wheelbarrow ready to use.  Order the exact amount of premixed concrete to be delivered. Ask for a wet mix which will give you a little more time to spread the concrete. Where possible, have the concrete poured directly into the base.
