      "headline":"Combine flour, fat and salt with water (or milk) to make the dough.",
      "description":"Knead for 5-10 minutes until smooth in a mixer or by hand. Leave in a cool place (such as the refrigerator) to rest for 2-3 hours, preferably overnight. This dough will make thin piadina, to make thicker piadina you may add 1 tsp of baking powder to the dough. Rest the dough for only half an hour. Alternatively, you may add 1 teaspoon of yeast, however yeast is not a traditional ingredient and will make your dough more like a pizza."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Divide the dough into 5 or 6 depending on your taste and serving needs.",
      "description":"Gently roll out your dough into a circle approx 20cm or 8 inches. To make thin piadina, roll out your dough 2mm or 1/12th of an inch thick. For thicker piadina, roll out the dough 5mm or 1/5th of an inch. This will make a smaller piadina approx 17cm or 7 inches across. You may also make 10 small piadina as a hand held party food 10cm or 4 inches across."

    {
      "headline":"Prepare your filling ingredients.",
      "description":"Ideally piadina should be served hot, fresh from the pan, so it is recommended to have your fillings ready for a quick meal."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Heat a barbecue flat plate or grill section, or heat a large cast iron pan.",
      "description":"Brush the piadina with a little olive oil and add to the hot pan or BBQ. Cook 1-2 minutes each side for thin piadina, until golden brown and crisp. Thick piadina should be cooked more gently for 2-3 minutes. The barbecue adds a delicious smoky taste to the bread which cannot really be replicated with a frying pan. This makes Piadina an ideal starter or lunch for BBQ parties, or when the weather is too hot to cook indoors."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Fill your piadina.",
      "description":"Place your filling on half of the piadina, season with salt and pepper and a little extra virgin olive oil if desired. Fold in half to eat similar to a taco, or cut into portions to serve. Alternatively, you may brush each hot piadina with garlic butter or top with bruschetta or salsa, cut into quarters and serve as a party food at a BBQ. For sweet Piadina, spread thickly with chocolate or hazelnut spread and enjoy hot."
