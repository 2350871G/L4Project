          "description":"Spot cleaning your backpack with a damp cloth can safely be done on any backpack, regardless of its material. However, not all backpacks are designed to be cleaned by submerging them in water or applying detergents or stain removers. Follow the guidance of the cleaning instructions to prevent damage to your backpack. If your backpack is still under warranty, it is especially important to follow the manufacturer\u2019s cleaning instructions so you do not void that warranty. Some backpacks may be covered in a waterproofing material that can be damaged if submerged in water or washed with regular detergent."

          "headline":"Remove everything from inside the backpack and shake out the dirt.",
          "description":"Take absolutely everything out from inside the backpack. Check each and every compartment and pocket. Once empty, hold your backpack upside down and shake out loose crumbs and dirt. If there\u2019s dirt stuck in the creases of your backpack, use a vacuum to remove as much of that dirt as possible before proceeding. You can also try using a makeup brush to loosen dirt stuck in the corners or edges of the inside of your backpack. If your backpack has a removable metal frame, take that out before proceeding."

          "headline":"Apply a stain remover and allow it to sit for 30 minutes.",
          "description":"Use a stain remover on any stains you find on the inside or outside of your backpack. Follow the instructions on the stain remover to determine how to apply the stain remover and how long it should sit on the fabric before proceeding. Use a toothbrush or a cloth to scrub the stain remover into the stain."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Fill a sink with warm water and mild non-detergent soap.",
          "description":"Find a sink or a bucket that\u2019s large enough to fit your entire backpack. If necessary, you can use your bathtub. Fill that sink, bucket, or tub with warm water and add a small amount of mild non-detergent soap. Use your hand to mix the soap into the water. Non-detergent soap is made from natural items (i.e., fats and oils from plants and animals) as opposed to synthetic chemicals. In general, non-detergent soaps are gentler on fabrics and won\u2019t damage any protective coatings it has. You can also purchase soap specifically designed to clean backpacks if you want to be extra careful."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Submerge your backpack in the sink and scrub gently.",
          "description":"Put your backpack in the sink, bucket, or tub and make sure it\u2019s completely submerged under the water. Use a cloth to wash the inside and outside of your backpack. Use a soft brush or a toothbrush to scrub any really dirty areas or stains. Avoid using hot water, as it may make the colours on your backpack\u2019s fabric run. Do not use bleach or fabric softener to hand wash your backpack. Both items may ruin the fabric or its protective coating."

If you have a double laundry sink or two buckets, you can have the second sink or bucket ready with cool water. Make sure you rinse all the soap out of the sink, bucket, or tub before refilling it with clean water."

        {
          "headline":"Place your backpack in the clean water and thoroughly rinse away the soap.",
          "description":"Submerge your backpack in the clean water and use a clean cloth or your hand to wipe the soap off the fabric. Make sure to rinse all areas of the outside and inside of your backpack. You may need to turn your backpack inside out to rinse the inside parts. If you\u2019re using a sink or a tub, drain the water while your backpack is still inside. Use the faucet to rinse any leftover soap out of your backpack."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Allow your backpack to air dry lying down or hanging upside down.",
          "description":"Take the backpack out of the sink, bucket, or tub and wring it as best you can. You can also use a dry towel to try to soak up as much excess water as you can, especially inside the various compartments. Lay the bag flat on another dry towel or hang it upside down to air dry. Do not use or store your backpack until it is totally and completely dry. Do not put your backpack in the dryer. The heat will ruin the fabric and its protective coating."

If your backpack has any leather on it, even leather trim, do not put it in a washing machine. If your backpack has decals, jewels, or other items glued or sewn onto the outside, it should probably be hand washed to ensure those items aren\u2019t damaged.

This will help ensure that the backpack doesn\u2019t get snagged on the agitator or isn\u2019t twisted and stretched out of shape. It will also prevent any missed items from inside the backpack from getting loose. You can purchase a laundry bag at a department store or online.

For smaller backpacks, you can include other items in the load. Set the washing machine to the gentle or delicate cycle with cold water and use only non-detergent soap. Do not use hot water to wash your backpack, as it may cause the colours to run.
