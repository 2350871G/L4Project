  "text":" Preparation Preheat your oven to 425\u00b0F/220\u00b0C. Place a wire rack on top of a baking sheet and coat the rack with a nonstick vegetable oil spray. Snap off the tough ends of each asparagus spear. Alternatively, place the spears on a cutting board and slice off the tough root ends. Making the Batter and Coating Lightly whisk the egg whites in a small, deep bowl.  Transfer the egg whites to a flat plate once they begin to get fluffy.  Stir together the panko breadcrumbs, flour, and cheese in another bowl.  Lightly season the bread crumb mixture with salt and pepper.  Transfer the crumbs to a shallow plate.  Coating the Sticks Coat each asparagus spear in the egg white mixture.  Dip each spear in the breadcrumbs. Roll each stick around until they\u2019re completely covered in the crumbs. If the crumb coating won\u2019t stick to the spear, dip the asparagus back into the egg whites and re-roll it into the breadcrumbs. Baking the Sticks Lay each coated spear on the wire rack.  Place the spears in the oven. Bake them for 15 minutes, or until the spears are golden brown and crispy on the outside. Remove the sticks from the oven. Place them on a serving platter. Serve the crispy Parmesan asparagus sticks. Serve with a dipping sauce if desired. Finished. ",
