Organizing Cabinets and Drawers Designate each cabinet and drawer for a specific item or items. Then, arrange your items in the cabinets and drawers. Place the items you use often near the front of your cabinets to make them easy to reach. This makes it easier to store similar items together so you can quickly find what you want. For example, you might designate a large cabinet for your dishware, a small cabinet for mugs, a bottom cabinet for pots and pans, etc. You might have one drawer for towels and pot holders, one drawer for utensils, and one drawer for extra cooking tools. Keep your cleaning supplies under your sink. It\u2019s easy to forget about the cabinet under your sink, but it\u2019s the perfect place to store your kitchen cleaners. Keep your cleaning wipes, sprays, soaps, and sponges under the sink. If you need more storage space, install a shelf or decorative baskets under your sink. Use trays with compartments to organize the contents of your drawers. Choose a tray that is the same size of your drawer or smaller.

For instance, you might use trays in your top cabinets so that the items you\u2019ve stored in the back of your cabinets are still accessible.

Pour foods like cereals, grains, and baking supplies into stackable containers. Then, arrange them neatly in your pantry. Group your foods into categories. For example, stack your cereals together, your pasta noodles together, and your baking supplies together. Use a file sorter or magazine holder for items like lids or baking sheets. Put the file sorter or magazine holder inside your cabinet, then put your lids or baking sheets into it. This allows you to store the items upright, keeping your cabinets uncluttered and your items within easy reach. Choose a sturdy metal file sorter so it\u2019ll stay upright. Both plastic and metal magazine holders will work well for your kitchen storage. Place items on a lazy susan to avoid digging for the thing you need. A lazy susan spins, allowing you to have easy access to all of the items it contains. They come in several different sizes. You can put a lazy susan in your cabinet or pantry to store spices, canned goods, or other items. A small lazy susan works great for spices, while a larger lazy susan might be a great option for canned goods. Keep your junk drawer clean with small, lidded containers. If you have a junk drawer, maximize its use by keeping your items sorted into smaller containers. Label the containers so you know what\u2019s inside them. Go through your drawer regularly and get rid of the items you aren\u2019t using. Filling Your Refrigerator Place ready to eat foods and drinks on your top shelf. This includes pre-packaged foods, eggs, and leftovers. The top shelf is easiest to access. Plus, storing these items at the top of the refrigerator helps prevent contamination because no foods are placed above them. Store drinks that are too tall for the top shelf on the middle shelf of your refrigerator. Avoid storing them on the door, where it's warmer. Keep your raw meats on the lower shelf of your refrigerator. This prevents them from leaking onto your other ingredients and contaminating them. However, check over your meats to make sure they aren't leaking before you store them, as they can spread bacteria. If you find a leak, repackage your meat and clean up the spill using an antibacterial cleaner. Protect your crisper by placing your meats in a plastic container that fits on your lower shelf. If the meat leaks, it'll leak into the container, not onto your produce. Put raw produce on the middle shelf or in the crisper. Keeping your produce on the middle shelf makes it easier to pull it out when you're ready to cook. Plus, this keeps it above the meat in your refrigerator. However, your crisper can control humidity and provide the best environment for your fruits and vegetables, so you might prefer to keep them there. If you use the crisper, make sure you don't overfill the drawers, which makes it harder to find what you need. Keep your condiments on the door of your refrigerator. The door is the warmest part of your refrigerator, so the only safe thing to store there is your condiments. Group them according to type so it's easy to find what you need. For example, put jams and jellies together, group marinades together, and put all of your sandwich dressings in one spot. Put your cheese and lunch meats in the cheese drawer. Most refrigerators have a small drawer below the top shelf where you traditionally store cheese. If you buy sandwich meats, you can also place those in the cheese drawer. This keeps your cheeses safe and easy to find. Creating Extra Storage Space Use the space on top of your cabinets or refrigerator. Don\u2019t let your vertical space go unused. Store or display items you don\u2019t use often. Here are some ways to maximize the space you have available:\nStore your rarely used items, such as holiday dishes, in an out-of-the-way location like the back of a cabinet or even a garage or basement. Arrange your favorite cookbooks for a stylish storage solution. Keep your wine rack on top of your cabinets. Put your decorative items on top of cabinets or in out-of-reach locations to safely display them and dress up the space. If you have a lot of unused space at the top of your cabinets, install a shelf to allow for extra storage. Store items on a rolling cart if you\u2019re short on cabinet space. Opt for a stylish cart that fits your kitchen decor. Rolling carts give you more space for pantry items, cookbooks, and cooking supplies. You can also use a cart to conveniently store your coffee and tea supplies, if you\u2019re a daily drinker. You can find a cart at your local department store, home goods store, or online. Use an open bookshelf for easy access. A bookshelf can hold extra dishes, extra appliances, pantry items, cookbooks, and decorative items. Place your bookshelf against a wall in your kitchen or along the side of your refrigerator if space is limited. Arrange your items so that they\u2019re visually appealing. A bookshelf is a great way to create functional decor! Install shelves in your cabinets. Shelves are a great way to add more useable space to your cabinets. Stacking items can make it hard to get to what you need, but adding an extra shelf lets you create small stacks that are easy to access. For an inexpensive option, use collapsible plastic shelves. You can find these at a department store, home store, or online. Put hanging hooks on walls or inside of cabinet doors. Place your wall hooks on the wall behind your stove or above your sink. Install hooks on the insides of cabinets to hold small items or items you use often. Hooks can hold pots and pans, decorations, measuring cups, towels, etc. You can use Command hooks for an easy option that won\u2019t damage your wall or cabinet doors. If you\u2019re going to be hanging a heavy item, like a pot, you might install a sturdier hook. Hang an over-the-door shoe organizer on your pantry door. Use a shoe organizer on the inside of your pantry door to organize food or other kitchen supplies. The small pockets on the organizer are great for keeping track of a lot of small items. You can also add labels to the pouches if you like. This can be a great solution for people who have kids. You might place your child-friendly snacks in the shoe organizer so your child can easily grab them. Get a mobile kitchen island for storage and counter space. A mobile kitchen island has wheels so it can be easily moved around the kitchen to suit your needs. Not only will it give you extra counter space on top, but you\u2019ll also have space to store the items in drawers, cabinets, or open space on the lower portion of the island. Mobile kitchen islands come in different sizes and can range in price from affordable to expensive. They\u2019re available at many department stores, as well as home improvement stores. You can also find them online. Install drawers in your bottom cabinets to maximize the space. You can find drawers designed for installation inside cabinets. Drawers will allow you to access the back of your cabinets with ease. Instead of digging in your cabinets, you can pull out the drawer and grab what you need. If you aren\u2019t handy around the house, you might hire a contractor or handyman to install your drawers.",
