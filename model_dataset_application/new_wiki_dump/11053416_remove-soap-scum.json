Spray or sponge on, let them break down the grime, scrub, rinse with warm water, and make sure to dry thoroughly. For bronze, brass and ceramic tile, use mostly water with just a little vinegar. In most cases you can scrub almost immediately. For tougher jobs, add 1/4 cup distilled white vinegar to a cup of baking soda, and let it form into a paste. Apply this with a sponge and wait about 15-30 minutes before scrubbing clean. You can also make a spray from equal parts water and vinegar, and add a tablespoon of dishwashing detergent. Spray your surface, let it work for about 15 minutes, then come in and scrub."

Abrasive surfaces help a lot, but be careful about scratching. Wet cloths and paper towels serve well in a pinch, but they rely a lot on your chemical cleaners. A damp sponge, especially the coarse side, is good for scrubbing away grime. Keep a sharp watch, though, as it will collect a lot of scum to itself. Pumice is extremely effective, but again it will collect the grime. Use a soft brush to clean it out as it gets dirty. Be very careful on tile, as it will scratch, and do not use pumice on fiberglass. Always rinse with water and dry thoroughly."
