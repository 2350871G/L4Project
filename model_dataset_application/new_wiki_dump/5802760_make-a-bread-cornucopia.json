  "text":" Bread cornucopia Start by making the cornucopia shape in foil. A good tip is to use a plastic bottle as a basic guide for making the cone. Shapes can vary; a two-liter bottle will make a bigger mold, while a smaller water bottle will make a much smaller one. Use sheets of foil to wrap around the bottle until the foil is thick and sturdy enough to hold some weight. Take the bottle out (with gloves, if needed to protect your skin from being scratched by the foil)  and bend the foil funnel into a horned-like shape. The shape shouldn't be too curvy, however, just the end; otherwise, it will be hard to take out of the bread when you're done. Stuff the horn with balls of foil for extra resilience and to keep the shape intact. Cut a bunch of separate dough strips out of any fresh bread dough you wish to use. Pizza dough works well, since it hardens well to keep the shape once you're done baking. You'll want to /lightly/ grease the foil on the outside before you start layering the strips as well. Start curling the strips of dough around the foil shape, starting at the tail end. Just strap them around and make them overlap slightly for the best result. If you feel like getting creative, you can always weave and curl the pieces of dough any way you like, as long as you cover the entire foil shape. For the lip of the cornucopia, you can braid three strips of dough to give it a nice finish. Glaze the cornucopia with egg mix before you put it in. To do this, just beat one or two eggs with a whisk (until fluffy) and paint over the dough. Bake according to the instructions accompanying the dough. Check on the baking process frequently, to make sure that the cornucopia doesn't burn. If some areas are getting more baked than others, a strip of foil on that area can keep it from getting too brown. Remove when baked. Allow to cool down for approximately half an hour, or until it can hold its shape. Separate the cornucopia from the foil. Slowly and carefully remove the foil from the bread once it has completely cooled down. You will be left with an empty bread horn. Fill the bread horn as you like. It is good for adding fruit, veggies or anything else edible and dry. Add some sprigs of rosemary if you prefer to scent the bread and decorate it. Do not add moist or wet food, as the bread will break down. Place on the table as your centerpiece for Thanksgiving or any other harvest event. Enjoy your masterpiece. Raffia cornucopia (bread substitute) Make papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9. The base of this horn is made of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9. Use the tin foil described in the previous method as a base. Wrap the papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 on top of the foil horn shape. Remember to leave the top open, about 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 centimeters). Alternatively, you can make a rough shape by using newspapers and tape and cover that with the papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9. Let the papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 dry. However, be sure to take the base shape out before allowing it to dry completely. The papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 must dry both inside and out before proceeding. Cover the entire horn shape inside and out with burlap. (Burlap is a rough spun brownish fabric). In theory, you can use other fabrics as well, but burlap looks best. Attach it with hot glue. Add the raffia in a spiral pattern going round and round. Start at the bottom and glue it with the hot glue, going up. Attach several layers, weaving it as you go. Make it stick out at certain places, to give it a more natural look. Done. It's now ready to be filled with anything you like.",
