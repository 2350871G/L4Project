You can measure out about 20 almonds and place them in a plastic bag. You can also pick 100-calorie packs of almonds at a local supermarket."

Place your almonds in a bowl and soak them in water overnight. In the morning, remove them from the water and rinse them. Then, place them on a wet towel for an additional 12 hours. Keep in mind, there is no hard evidence that almonds are inherently more nutritious when soaked. You can still get nutrients from un-soaked almonds."

Make sure to read ingredients labels before purchasing flavored almonds, however. Avoid flavored almonds that are very high in sugar or calories. A high sugar content can take away from the overall health benefits of almonds."

You can buy trail mix with almonds mixed in or add your own almonds to trail mix. Get trail mix without any added sugar. Dried fruit can sometimes have a lot of sugar added unnecessarily. Some trail mixes come with added chocolate. Dark chocolate is the healthiest option, so opt for mixes with dark chocolate."
