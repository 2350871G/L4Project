The safest bet is to buy a pack of pre-sculpted crab sticks from the supermarket. If you're much more the DIY type, you can get bigger slabs to cut into the pieces yourself. Outside of a deep-frying oil, you thankfully won't need anything else to get this recipe started. You can of course, however, add spices and garnishes to your personal preference."
