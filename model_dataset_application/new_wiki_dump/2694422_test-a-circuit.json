          "description":"Continuity testers work by sending a small current through the circuit, so the circuit needs to be disconnected from its power supply. If you\u2019re testing a simple school project circuit (two wires running between a 9v battery and a light, for instance), just disconnect the wires from the battery. If you\u2019re testing for continuity in home electrical wiring, turn off the appropriate breaker at your main electrical service panel. Next, test a non-contact voltage tester on a circuit you know is working (such as any meter you use daily). Then, use the non-contact voltage tester to make sure the power is off at the circuit you\u2019ll be testing. Separate the circuit you want to test from other potentially hot wires to ensure you don't get a false positive. Then, simply place the tip of the voltage tester near the wiring of the circuit you\u2019ll be testing. If the voltage tester lights up and \u201cchirps,\u201d the power is still on."
