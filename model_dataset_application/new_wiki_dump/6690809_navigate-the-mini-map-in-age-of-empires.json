  "text":" Left-Clicking the Map Locate the minimap on your screen. In AoE1 and AoE2, the minimap is a small trapezoidal map of the game world in the bottom-right corner of the screen, while in AoE3, it is a small round map in the bottom left corner. Click on the minimap the location you want to navigate to. Move your mouse to the location you want on the minimap and then just left-click to go there. This will instantly move the camera to that part of the game world. Click again on the minimap to go to a different part of the game world. To jump to a different part of the game world using the minimap, left-click the corresponding part of the minimap. Note that parts of the game world that have not been explored will appear black and blank on the minimap just as they will on the actual game world. Go back to your town center. Similarly, you can left-click the area where your town is to go back if you\u2019ve finished exploring. Alternatively, you can press the hotkey H (for AoE1 & 2) or T (for AoE3), and you will be taken there right away. Dragging the Focus Box Drag the white focus box to navigate to different parts of the minimap. The focus box is the small square bordered by white lines on the minimap that shows the section of the map that is currently being viewed on the game screen. Using the left mouse button, click, hold, and drag the white focus box to move to different parts of the minimap and hence the game world. Move to other locations. To move to a different part of the minimap, just drag the focus box to that particular location again. Return to your Town Center. Like navigating to other locations, you can navigate back to your town by dragging the focus box to it. You can also use the hotkeys (H for AoE1 & 2, or T for AoE3) to quickly focus on the Town Center. Using the Arrow Keys (AoE 3) Press the Left, Right, Up, and Down arrow keys to navigate the minimap. Pressing the arrow keys accordingly (i.e., left key to move left, up key to move up, and so on) will allow you to scroll the focus to the area of the minimap you want to go to. Press the arrow keys again to go to a different part of the game world. If you need to move to a different location on the game world, just press the arrow keys. Change the scroll settings.
