  "text":" Simple Vegan Grilled Cheese Sandwich Visit your local health food store or vegetarian section of the supermarket. Look for vegan cheese in a flavor of your choice. There are many possibilities, from Cheddar and mozzarella to smoked and feta styles, all veganized. Choose one that can be cut into slices. Place the pan on the stove. Put it on medium heat. Grease the pan with olive oil to prevent it from sticking. Mix the mayonnaise and vegan margarine together in a small bowl. Spread it on one side of the bread slices. Place the cheese slices onto the inside of the bread.  Heat the pan over medium heat. Once the pan is done heating, cook each side of the bread slices until golden brown. Use a lid to press down on the sandwich, so that the cheese melts more easily. To tell if the pan is done heating, splash some water on the pan; if it starts to sizzle, it's done. Remove the sandwich from the pan. Place it onto a plate. Let the sandwich cool down. Enjoy your grilled cheese sandwich! Mozzarella Style Vegan Grilled Cheese Sandwich Make the vegan mozzarella first. Place the cashews in the small saucepan and the water. Bring to the boil. Cook for 10 to 15 minutes to soften the cashews. Remove from the pan and drain. Rinse the cashews. Add the cashews to the blender. Add all of the other ingredients (including the 1 cup of water) as well. Blend until smooth and watery. The cashews shouldn't be noticeable anymore; if your blender isn't powerful enough to completely blend them, strain the mixture before heating. Pour the cashew mixture into the saucepan. Heat on medium-high heat and stir continuously. After about 5 minutes, it will congeal, which is the consistency you're after. Keep stirring and cook for another minute to firm it. Remove from the heat. Divide into three portions for use in the sandwich. Make the sandwich. Spread the vegan butter/spread on each slice of bread. Arrange one portion of mozzarella cheese on each of three slices. Place the other three slices on top, keeping the buttered sides facing outward. Place the pan on the stovetop. Heat over medium heat. Place each sandwich into the pan and grill until golden brown. Flip over and do the same for the other side of each sandwich. It's a good idea to press the sandwiches down with a spatula to spread the cheese and ensure that the cheese is heated right through. Remove from the pan. Serve immediately. This goes well with a hot sauce or ketchup. Vegan Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Jalape\u00f1os Cut the jalape\u00f1o in half. Remove the stem and seeds, and any veins. The removal of the seeds helps to tone down the chili's heat. Chop finely, then set aside. Place the bread slices down on a clean work surface. Spread the vegan cream cheese on one slice of bread. Sprinkle the finely chopped jalape\u00f1o over the spread, making sure to cover it evenly. Lay a vegan cheese slice onto the other piece of bread. Sprinkle with the pickled jalape\u00f1o slices. Lay the other cheese slice over the top of the jalape\u00f1o pieces. Close the two pieces of bread together. Spread a little vegan \"butter\" spread on the outside of both pieces of bread. This step is optional but will increase the buttery crispiness of the whole sandwich once cooked. Heat the pan over medium heat. Add vegetable or coconut oil. When it has heated up, carefully add the sandwich. Cook the sandwich. Press down on the sandwich as it cooks, using a spatula. This helps to keep the sandwich together and causes the vegan cheese to melt and ooze nicely. Flip the sandwich over when one side is golden. Cook the other side for about the same time. If the oil has been soaked up, add more to avoid burning. Remove from the heat when both sides are golden and the vegan cheese has melted. Pop onto a plate, cut in halves and serve immediately.",
