Think carefully about each item, making sure that you\u2019re truly going to use the item if you\u2019re choosing to keep it. If you haven\u2019t used an item in several years or are just keeping it in case you need it in the future, it\u2019s likely safe to get rid of the item. Things like unused books or clothing can be donated or recycled, while things that don\u2019t have a way to be repurposed can be thrown out."

Come up with fair prices for the belongings you\u2019re trying to sell and see what you\u2019re able to get rid of! If you\u2019re posting your belongings for sale online, take good quality photos of each item so people know what they\u2019re buying.

Reorganizing the things you\u2019re keeping into smaller piles will help you see how many storage containers you might need and how to organize the items you have left.
