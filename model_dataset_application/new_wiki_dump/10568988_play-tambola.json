A popular winning point for tambola games is full house, which means that the ticket with all of the numbers struck first wins. Early 5 is another common winning point option. The player who first strikes 5 numbers in any row wins. This is best if you only want to play a short game. First row is another winning point alternative. This means that the player who is first to strike all of the numbers along the top row wins. Corners is another winning point option if you want to play a short game. The player who can strike each number in the 4 corners of the ticket first, wins. This means that the first and last numbers of the top and bottom rows will be crossed out. There are many variations on what the winning point can be for the game. If you are organizing the game, feel free to make up your own winning point, or explore the many ideas available either online or with other tambola players."

There are 5 numbers in each horizontal row, with the remaining 4 boxes randomly blocked out. The first column has numbers from 1-9, the second from 10-19, and so on, up to the number 90. You can purchase tambola tickets online, or you can make your own using a random number generator. Make sure that each person has a pen or pencil before the game begins so that they can cross off the numbers as they are called."
