Pinch the end of the dosa with your fingertips and tear away a bite-sized piece. Don't let the food touch your palms. Dosa is not meant to be eaten like a sandwich. Traditionally, Indians will eat dosa with their right hand. Eating with your left hand could be considered rude in some places. Use your thumb to tear away the dosa when using one hand."

Dip a piece of dosa in each accompaniment, one at a time, so that you get a taste of each ingredient separately. Avoid putting your fingers in your mouth as this could be considered rude. If you want, you can dip the dosa in both the sambar and chutney for a unique flavor, however, this may contaminate the taste of each accompaniment.
