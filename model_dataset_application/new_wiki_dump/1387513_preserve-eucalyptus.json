This will reduce the time and effort you need to spend pruning the branches later. There are over 700 species of eucalyptus trees and plants, so it can be difficult to know what branches in peak condition look like. Generalizing about their properties at their peak is impossible. For instance, one species (E. dundasii) has shiny green leaves throughout its life. Another species (E. caesia) has shiny green leaves only when young. Identify the species of eucalyptus you wish to preserve and check a botanical reference guide to find out what the species you're dealing with looks like during its peak. Use your best judgment and preference to determine the right harvest time for you."

Stay away from eucalyptus plants whose flowers are brown or drooping. Healthy eucalyptus flowers are generally white, pink, or red. Healthy eucalyptus leaves should be free of holes and have an even green color. Treating the Eucalyptus Plant Create a preservation solution. To preserve eucalyptus, mix a solution of one part glycerin with two parts water. Heat the mixture to boiling or near-boiling. You can obtain glycerin at your local arts and crafts shop or big box store. Place the eucalyptus in the preservation solution. Once your glycerin and water solution is ready, pour the mixture into a stable, wide-bottomed vase. Place the eucalyptus branches in the vase with the cut end of the stem in the liquid. The liquid should reach about three inches (eight centimeters) up the length of the eucalyptus stem. To help your eucalyptus branches absorb the preservation solution more quickly, slice the bases of the stems a bit, or smash them once or twice with a hammer. Place your eucalyptus branches in a cool environment. Put the vase containing the eucalyptus somewhere with moderate humidity and a temperature of 60 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (16 to 24 degrees Celsius). Keep the branches out of direct sunlight as they absorb the preservation solution. Refill the liquid in the vase as need, since some will evaporate over time.
