          "description":"If you have windows, this is one of the easiest and most effective options you have at your disposal for keeping your garage cool. When a garage is exposed to the sun all day without any new air being brought into it, the temperature inevitably gets very high. If you live in a safe area, and one that doesn\u2019t get too windy, feel free to leave your windows open overnight. This allows the cold air from the night to come in and cool down the garage."

Leaving your car outside until it has cooled off can prevent the temperature in the garage from increasing. If you\u2019re in a hurry to get your car into your garage, try pouring some cold water on the roof of the car to cool it off."

          "description":"When a room has a high humidity level, it makes the temperature feel significantly higher than it really is. Look for a dehumidifier that can run on a preset program so you don\u2019t have to constantly adjust it. Humidifiers work by drawing moisture out of the air and sending back clean dry air. They normally store the moisture that they collect in a tray at the bottom of the unit. Once the unit is full of water, the dehumidifier stops working, so make sure that you empty the water out of it every day. You can just dispose of this water down the sink or toilet."

Position these fans on the wall directly across from the garage door and place them near the ceiling so they are as efficient as possible. For best results, keep your garage door open 4 inches (10 cm) or so to increase the air circulation within the space. If you don't want to install sidewall ventilation fans, select a swiveling, freestanding fan with large blades that has multiple settings. Another option is installing a ceiling fan. These are a little more expensive than freestanding fans, but as they help circulate the entire room, the price is often worth it."
