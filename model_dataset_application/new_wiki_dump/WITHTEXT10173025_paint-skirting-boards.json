          "headline":"Sand the skirting boards with fine 180-grit sandpaper.",
          "description":"This step is especially important if you are working with skirting boards that were previously painted with glossy paint. Rub fine sandpaper (180-grit) wrapped around a wood block in small circles on the skirting boards to create a rougher surface on the skirting boards that the paint will stick to. You don\u2019t have to entirely remove the paint that was there before, but sand enough so that the shine on the board disappears. Turn to 80- to 120-grit sandpaper if you want to get rid of bumps or imperfections (i.e. large globs of old paint). Sandpaper sponges also work great, especially for sanding surfaces (like skirting boards) that aren\u2019t completely flat."

Be particularly mindful of the little crack between the skirting boards and the floor, as this is a notorious dust hiding place. Use a thinner hose or brush attachment for your vacuum if you have one."

          "headline":"Clean the skirting boards with a damp sponge.",
          "description":"Fill a bucket with water and non-soapy detergent (i.e. Dirtex, Spic & Span, or TSP No-Rinse Substitute). Dip your sponge in this mixture and wring the sponge out in the bucket before applying it to the boards. Then, wash the wood with the sponge by starting at the bottom of the skirting board and using up-and-down strokes. Give it at least an hour to dry before moving forward. If you\u2019re short on time, you can use a dry brush to get rid of the dust instead."

If your room has hardwood floors, place strips of masking tape on the floor where the skirting board meets the floor. Do this for the whole room. With carpet, the process is a little more involved. If you\u2019re working with a shorter kind of carpet, insert a putty knife in the space between the carpet and the skirting board at an angle to push the carpet away from the wall. Then, place the masking tape along where the skirting board meets the floor, leaving a slight lip (about \u20442 cm (0.20 in)) that is pressed onto the skirting board itself. Then, take your putty knife and press it down in the space between the skirting board and the carpet, pushing the tape down and leaving the skirting board fully exposed. However, with longer shag carpet (sometimes known as saxony or frieze), you\u2019re out of luck. The best way to protect the carpet is to pull it up and away from the skirting boards before painting."

Let it dry for 24 hours. This prevents any yellow knot marks in the wood from showing through and discoloring your paint."

Avoid using flat emulsion to paint, as this will result in skirting boards that can easily be marked up. In terms of gloss, go with semi-gloss paint (also sometimes called satin). Skirting boards are meant to be decorative, and semi-gloss paint will result in smoother, more reflective, and more attractive skirting boards."

If any paint drips where it\u2019s not supposed to on the board, blend it in before it dries and forms a bump. Avoid starting a brush stroke on paint that\u2019s already been smoothed. This will leave a pretty obvious brush mark. Try to start strokes in an unpainted area and brush toward finished areas. Use lighter strokes as you get closer to smoothed sections."

For the areas in between strokes, however, raise the brush slightly and lightly feather the paint together to avoid lap marks (marks that show where one stroke ended and another began). Feathering means gently using the tip of the brush to create a smooth transition between separate strokes. You will not need a lot of paint on your brush to do this. A common mistake is trying to blend the paint too long after it\u2019s been applied. This results in unsightly brushstrokes.
