          "description":"Unfortunately, fasteners like nails are necessary to hang up extremely heavy shelves made of dense, solid materials like steel or oak. However, you can use adhesive fasteners to hang up light, hollow shelves made of things like balsa wood. As a general rule, try to hang shelves that weigh 3 lb (1.4 kg) or less. For safety, do not attempt to hang shelves with adhesive strips if they weigh over 10 lb (4.5 kg). Look for hollow floating shelves at furniture stores or light planks of wood at hardware stores."

          "headline":"Purchase adhesive mounting strips.",
          "description":"To hang up your shelf, you\u2019ll need to get strong adhesive mounting strips designed for pictures or other large objects. Before buying a set of strips, check their weight capacity to make sure they can support your shelf and any objects you want to put on it. Purchase adhesive strips that have a sticky material on 1 side and a rough, Velcro-like gripping material on the other. Be aware that this is not the same type of material used for things like Command hooks. Popular adhesive strips include Command picture hanging strips, Scotch reclosable fasteners, and Velcro removable mounting strips. You can buy these products from most craft and office supply stores. For extremely small or light shelves, a moldable adhesive glue like Sugru may also work."

          "description":"Dampen a fresh cleaning cloth with isopropyl alcohol. Then, gently rub the cloth against your wall and the mounting side of your shelf. Give the surfaces around 5 minutes to dry before attaching your adhesive strips. Doing this will help remove grease, oil, and wax from the surfaces, making the adhesive strips easier to mount. Look for isopropyl alcohol at big-box and drug stores."

Then, remove the protective liner from 1 of the strips, press the newly-exposed adhesive side to your shelf\u2019s mounting area, and hold the connected strips down for about 30 seconds. Repeat this process with the rest of the strips. Space your strips out evenly to give your shelf the greatest amount of hanging strength possible. Use staples to attach your strips to shelves made of wood."

Then, press your shelf against the wall for 30 seconds to fix it in place. If possible, attach adhesive strips to 2 adjacent sides of the shelf and hang it in a corner. This will give your shelf a greater amount of support."

Each pair of strips should separate so that 1 side is attached to the wall and the other side is attached to the shelf. Then, push down on each individual adhesive strip for 30 seconds to make sure they adhere completely. If any of the strips come off, fix a new strip to your shelf and repeat the attachment and removal process."

As you let go of your shelf, watch it carefully to make sure it doesn\u2019t fall down. Consider placing blankets or pillows below your shelf to catch it if it falls."

          "description":"Without firm fasteners like nails, your shelf probably won\u2019t be able to support heavy objects like textbooks or appliances. However, it should be able to hold small trinkets, light-weight electronics, and similar items. Do not place glass objects or other fragile items on the shelf in case it falls down. If your shelf juts out from the wall by more than 4 or 5 in (10 or 13 cm), place your objects near the back of the shelf to avoid ripping it away from the adhesive strips."
