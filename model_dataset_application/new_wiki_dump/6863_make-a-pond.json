          "description":"What function will it serve? Think about the features you\u2019d enjoy most as you begin constructing plans. The most common backyard ponds fall into one of the following categories. A wildlife pond is perhaps the easiest type of pond to construct. It doesn\u2019t require a pump, so it needn\u2019t be close to a source of electricity. A wildlife pond is built to look like a natural part of the landscape. Because it isn\u2019t stocked with fish, it is attractive to frogs, slugs, water sliders, and other animals that may come to it to have a drink or bathe away. A garden pond is more ornamental in appearance. Garden ponds typically have lily pads and other aquatic plants, and are built to complement the design of one\u2019s garden. Artfully arranged stones, small pump-based waterfalls, and a smattering of goldfish are often features of garden ponds."

          "description":"Most ponds do best in spots that get mixed sun and shade, since this environment allows plants to grow and keeps algae at bay. You may want to locate the pond in a place you can see from your home, so you can enjoy it even in cold or rainy weather. If you\u2019re constructing your pond in the backyard, the first thing to do is call your gas and electric company and ask them to come to your house and mark the locations of your gas and electric lines, so you\u2019ll know not to dig in those spots. If you have a larger property, other considerations may be involved. Call the Department of Agriculture to find out if there are places on your property that are protected watersheds, and ask if there are any other local regulations you should know about before you begin digging. Don\u2019t choose a spot too close to trees, as you may damage their root systems."

If you\u2019re in a dryer regions, like the southwest region of the US, a shallow pond will evaporate quickly. Conduct research to find out what depth makes sense for your region. Larger ponds are easier to to maintain. They\u2019re more stable, so plants and other wildlife have a better chance of survival.

Keep these factors in mind as you dig:\nSince you want to facilitate the growth of wildlife, your pond should be deep enough that it won\u2019t freeze solid over the winter. If you\u2019re in an area that gets cold, you\u2019ll want to dig the pond several feet deep so that the animals living there can live overwinter. One side of the pond should have a gradual slope, a beach of sorts, so that animals that wander in will be able to make their way out. Animals can drown in ponds with steep cliffs on every side. Reserve the topsoil in a pile as you dig. You\u2019ll be using this later when you edge the pond. When you\u2019re finished digging, remove sharp rocks from the hole."

You can use newspapers or burlap, but biodegradable materials may rot in time, effectively leaving you with no protection other than the layer of sand. Stones may force their way up through this sand layer and damage the liner. So consider non-biodegradable material such as specialist pond underlay as an option. When you've placed this layer down, cover it with a large piece of waterproof pond liner. Different types of waterproof pond liners are available at home improvement stores, and often at garden stores."

Insert the spade a few inches into the slit, maneuver it so it is parallel to the ground, and gently lift the grass around the entire slit, creating a sort of grass flap around the entire pond. Now lift back the grass flap and tuck the edges of the pond liner into the slit, replacing the grass flap over the top to conceal the slit as you go. This gives the pond a \u201cnatural\u201d edge, which will be inviting to the wildlife in your area."

Return to your pond and add the natural pond water, which contains bacteria and microscopic animals that will help establish your pond as a more natural water source for wildlife."

Their presence will prevent the pond from attracting frogs, snails, and other wildlife. Create a muddy pond bottom by dumping the topsoil back into the pond. You may plant reeds and other natural aquatic plants, such as water lilies, to help facilitate the growth of other wildlife.

If you choose to install electric devices the pond should be located close enough to your home that you\u2019ll have access to electricity. Use a shovel to dig a large hole according to the size and depth you have chosen. If you plan to install a pump, dig a second deeper hole of about 10 inches at the center of the pond. Create a second level for aquatic plants by digging a shallower shelf around the perimeter of the pond. You may also use a preformed pond shape, available at garden stores.

Dig a shallow shelf under the liner, lay the liner edges flat, and set heavy, flat stones on top of the liner around the edge of the pond. Large stones and flagstone work well for this purpose. Make sure the stones are set a few inches into the ground, so that they will be level with the surface of the pond when it is filled. If the stones are large and heavy, it is not necessary to mortar them. If you\u2019re using smaller, lighter stones, you may want to add mortar to prevent them from coming loose when people stand at the pond\u2019s edge. If you\u2019re installing a waterfall device, it is attractive to surround it with stones. Be creative here: you may create patterns with stones, or use stones of varying shapes, sizes, and colors to accent your garden."
