If the infection is widespread, it\u2019s better to prune off entire limbs rather than just removing leaves. Treat what remains, including the leaves\u2019 bottoms as well as their tops. Although there is no guaranteed cure for black spot disease, try the following remedies, which can slow and prevent the disease from spreading, and use whichever shows the best results:\nMix together a solution of 1 tbsp. baking soda, 2.5 tbsp. vegetable oil, 1 tsp. liquid soap, and 1 gallon water. Be sure to use liquid soap, not detergent. Since this may potentially burn your leaves, spray a small test area with the solution before spraying the entire plant. If burning is absent or minimal, spray the leaves once every two weeks. Combine 1-part dairy milk to 2-parts water. Spray the leaves once each week. (Sorry, vegans; non-dairy milk substitutes won\u2019t work). Spray the leaves with neem oil once every two weeks. Use fungicides as a last resort if the disease returns for multiple growing seasons. Follow their directions regarding applications. Apply them early, before outbreaks or at the first sign of spots, since they are preventative in nature. Choose organic products if possible for both the plant\u2019s health as well as pollinating insects."
