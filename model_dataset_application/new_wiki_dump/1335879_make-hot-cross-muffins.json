  "text":" Prepare the muffin pans. Line the pan with the paper cupcake cases. Preheat the oven to 180\u00baC, 350\u00baF. Grate the orange zest. Wash the orange first and dry it completely before grating. Be sure to grate it finely, so as not to include the white pith underneath. Juice the orange. The entire juice will get used up in the muffins and icing. Melt the butter in a small saucepan. Use medium heat and don't overheat it. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool to lukewarm temperature. Sift the flour, cinnamon, and mixed spice into a large mixing bowl. Stir in together. Add the sugar and stir through.  In another mixing bowl, prepare the liquid ingredients. Pour in the melted butter, milk and orange zest. Crack in the 2 eggs and add 2 tablespoons of the freshly squeezed orange juice. Mix all together well. Pour this egg mixture into the flour mixture bowl. Make a well in the middle and pour in the mixture. Stir only enough to combine it (muffins shouldn't be over-stirred). Add the raisins or currants. Stir through very gently and quickly. Spoon the mixture evenly into each of the prepared cupcake cases in the muffin pan. Be generous as these are each taking the place of a bun! Place in the oven. Bake for 20 minutes, or until a skewer comes out clean when inserted. It is a good idea to check at around the halfway and three-quarter way cooking time to see if they're ready earlier. Remove from the oven. At this point, you can stop and hand out the \"hot\" cross muffins so that they can be enjoyed hot. Give people some butter or margarine to spread on them as an option. Alternatively, leave to cool on the wire cooling rack and prepare the muffins for icing. The icing will be piped across the top of each hot cross muffin in the shape of a cross, to indicate their Easter affiliation. Make the icing. Sift the icing sugar (confectioners sugar) into a small mixing bowl. Add the orange juice and warm water. Mix together to form a smooth paste. Spoon the icing mixture into a plastic sandwich bag for piping. Cut a very small hole in one corner of the bag for the icing to pour through. (Always cut smaller than you think; it's easier to increase the hole size than decrease it.) Squeeze the icing gently into lines of a cross on each muffin.  Leave to set.
