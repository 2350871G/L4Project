Make sure to cover your space with newspaper or something that can keep the clay from sticking onto the table! Split rings come in a variety of shapes and sizes. You can buy larger ones that a decorative clay shape can be directly attached to or you can buy a more complex split ring and chain assembly that is made specifically to attach your own keychain art to. Pick whichever one you like. You can even reuse parts from an old keychain if you have one lying around."
