Look at the letters that make up your name, and think about how you can best emphasize them: note the interesting letters (with a lot of loops, dots, and crosses, like G, X, or B) and the plain letters (especially those that look similar between uppercase and lowercase, like S or O). Look for any areas that could become focal points of your signature."

          "description":"A simple and clear signature will be easier for people to read, but a more complex signature might show more flair. The more flourish you put into your signature, the more flamboyant you may seem. Consider how your signature might speak to the luxury of time. Busy doctors often scrawl hasty, illegible signatures, whereas famous writers often take the time to orchestrate intricate designs. Signatures that include just your initials (with or without the middle initial) are usually considered more formal and businesslike than full-name signatures. If you\u2019re worried about forgery, consider making your signature longer and more legible. Include your entire first and last name. Be sure to write clearly. It is easier to forge scribbled signatures than it is to copy the nuances of a practiced, legible signature."

If you are known only by your first or last name\u2014like Beyonce or Ronaldo\u2014 then you might consider using just the first name. If you are a professor who typically goes by their last name, you may just sign your surname."

Turn one of your letters into an underline. This is commonly done with the last letter, but feel free to add a flourish to any letter that lends itself to the style. Letters with a long tail (y, g, j) are perfect. Drag the tail out beneath the signature. Underline your signature with loops. This is a very fluid, ornate way to spice up a signature.
