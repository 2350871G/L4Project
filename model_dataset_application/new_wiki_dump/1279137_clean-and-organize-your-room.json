Depending on how dirty your room is, you may need 1 to 3 trash bags. You should have a duster and wipes no matter what.

In your pantry, put all the cereals together. Put the snacks in another area. See if you can have a healthy area and a snack area. Or, separate items by meal. Put your breakfast stuff at the top, lunch in the middle, and dinner at the bottom. In your fridge, put your milk and other perishable liquids in the actual fridge, not the door. The opening of the door can cause liquids to splash around, sometimes leaking out. And the warm air can get to your items more easily there.

Keeping a clean kitchen is easiest when you don\u2019t let a mess build up. When cooking, make sure to clean and clear your ingredients, pots, pans, and utensils when you\u2019re done with these items. Put your spices and ingredients back where they belong when you finish. If you use a bowl to mix something, clean it or throw it in the dishwasher as soon as you can. Do your dishes right after your meal. Whatever you didn\u2019t get to before you finished cooking should be taken care of right after your meal. It will take you less time and keep you more organized than if you wait until there\u2019s a huge pile of dishes. Purge unneeded items from your kitchen. Go through your cabinets and drawers and throw out anything you don\u2019t use. If you have 6 spatulas and you only ever use 3, get rid of the other 3. Reach into the back of your cupboards and find the coffee mugs you haven\u2019t used and toss those as well. The more mugs, cups, and utensils you have, the easier it is to let dishes pile up. Go through your Tupperware and any older appliances. Check to make sure that every component is there. If something is missing a piece or part, get rid of it. Throw out grimy Tupperware and appliances you never use. Clean out any miscellaneous items you have, like ketchup packets, powders, and plastic silverware. Group like objects together. Similar items should go near each other for the best organization. Mugs and glasses should be near each other. Plates and bowls go together. Keep silverware near your cooking utensils. Store items close to where you use these items. It\u2019s a good idea to keep your plates and glasses close to your sink and dishwasher area. Doing this helps you to stay on top of cleaning. Store your lids for your Tupperware in one large container and stack your Tupperware bowls inside one another next to it. Clean out the pantry and fridge. Go through your fridge and pantry and take everything out. Throw away any food that is stale or gone bad. Before you put anything back in, give both areas a good wipe down with disinfectant and water. You want to clean off any stains and bacteria. Don\u2019t use bleach or any other harsh cleaning chemicals in the fridge, since these could contaminate your food. Stick to gentle cleansers, like warm water and dish soap or a solution of 1 part water to 1 part white vinegar. Store like food items together strategically. In your pantry, put all the cereals together. Put the snacks in another area. See if you can have a healthy area and a snack area. Or, separate items by meal. Put your breakfast stuff at the top, lunch in the middle, and dinner at the bottom. In your fridge, put your milk and other perishable liquids in the actual fridge, not the door. The opening of the door can cause liquids to splash around, sometimes leaking out. And the warm air can get to your items more easily there. Store food of like colors together, and keep your meats on the bottom shelf. Meats will sometimes leak juices. Place meat on the bottom so nothing leaks on anything else. Dust, sweep, vacuum, and mop, the rest of the kitchen. Now it\u2019s time to clean your cleared-off surfaces, stovetop, and the floor. Dust first and wipe off every surface, then sweep, vacuum, and mop. Don\u2019t forget to clean the tops of your cabinets. Remember that dusting will cause dust and dirt to drift to the floor, so start at the top and work your way down. Sweep next to remove any fallen dust and get the dirt off the floor. Make sure to get every corner and under all your appliances, like your fridge, dishwasher, and oven. Once you\u2019ve swept away the cobwebs, vacuum to pick up anything else, and then mop the area to really clean it. You should also wipe down your sink and cabinets. Perform a daily clean to keep your kitchen as clean as possible. Your kitchen gets a lot of traffic. Spending 5 minutes each day will keep it clean and organized. Wipe down the stove top after you cook on it to keep grime from building up. Regularly clean up any cabinets above or next to the stove, since these will quickly collect dust, grease, and spattered food. Don\u2019t go to bed with any dishes in the sink. Check your expiration dates every day. Before turning in for the night, do a once over in your fridge to make sure you don\u2019t have any spoiled food. This keeps your fridge uncluttered and clean.",
