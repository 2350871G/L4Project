The B, 8, and 6 are red, and the 1 and 4 are blue. Paperweights from 1847 are marked with B1847. The B, 8, and 7 are blue, the 1 is green, and the 4 is red. A Baccarat paperweight made in 1848 will be marked B1848, with a blue B, green 1 and 4, and red 8 and 9. In 1849, paperweights were marked only with the year, without the letter B. The 1 and 4 will be green and the 8 and 9 are red."
