If you are having trouble getting food remains off the inside, try to use an object like a spatula and scrape the food off, or run warm water onto the container and scrub off dried food. Wipe away grease or oil. Even if you have gotten rid of food scraps, you still may have a greasy residue on your container. Wipe the container thoroughly with a paper towel to absorb oil or grease."
