By having air and water tight containers, you\u2019ll keep contaminants out and limit environmental changes that may spoil your food. Consider glass jars.

Storing food in a clean and/or unopened container will minimize the ability of bacteria to grow and spoil the food. Wash all containers and utensils with scalding hot water. Use detergent or antibacterial soap to wash your utensils and containers. Beware of dangers when using hot water or detergents. Protect your eyes and avoid burning yourself or others around you."

Moisture may increase the chance of fungal spores growing or increase the humidity of the storage area \u2013 putting your food at risk. Make sure your food storage area is between 50 degrees to 70 degrees. Avoid placing your food storage area next to a source of heat, like an oven.

If you don\u2019t have one already, install a device that will monitor temperature and humidity. If your temperature varies more than 5 or 10 degrees over the course of a day, you should take steps to improve your storage area. This might include adding insulation to a dry storage area."

By providing maintenance, you\u2019ll make sure that your appliances maintain a stable temperature, keep moisture out, and keep pests out. Make sure your insulation and rubber stripping on your refrigerator and/or freezer is working. If your rubber stripping is broken or brittle, you\u2019ll lose cool air, make your unit work harder, and may allow moisture and pests to get in. Check coolant levels every year. To check your coolant level, locate the coolant chamber on the back of your refrigerator or freezer. Remove the cap and see if it is full -- the liquid should be apparent as you open it. If it is not full, refill it. If you are concerned there is a leak because it needs to be refilled often, contact someone to service your appliance.
