Bare root strawberries are plants that have been removed from the soil while dormant (so in the winter months), so the crown and roots will be brown when you buy them. This does not mean they are dead or unhealthy. Rather, you want to make sure the roots are long (at least 6\u20138 inches (15\u201320 cm)) and that the crown is developed. A developed crown is a short thickened stem that circles around the leaves and flower clusters. It looks like a wide band that is holding the emerging plant together."

This will give your plant enough root space to take hold in the soil, and it will keep the roots from getting tangled up with roots from a neighboring plant. If the roots aren\u2019t 6\u20138 inches (15\u201320 cm), you probably don\u2019t have a well-developed plant and should consider buying new ones."

If you won\u2019t be planting for a few days, you can store the plants in the refrigerator for up to a week.

Make sure to choose a pot that is wide enough to allow for several plants, keeping in mind that they need 12\u201318 inches (30\u201346 cm) of space between them.

Strawberry roots need space to expand, so the looser the soil, the better. You can buy new soil from the store if you are starting from scratch, or you can loosen up the old soil and mix it with compost or a new bag from the store.

Strawberry plants need lots of room and sunlight to grow well, so not crowding them when you plant them is the best way to ensure your plants will thrive.

  "text":" Trimming and Soaking the Strawberries Choose an everbearing variety for fruit all season long.
