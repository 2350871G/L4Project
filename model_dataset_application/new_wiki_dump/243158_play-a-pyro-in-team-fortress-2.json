          "headline":"Use the flamethrower at short-range.",
          "description":"The Pyro's flamethrower is most dangerous up close. At point-blank range, it's almost guaranteed to be fatal. Get as close to your enemy as you can before you use your flamethrower for massive damage."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use the flamethrower to deal burning damage over time.",
          "description":"The flamethrower is the only base weapon that causes additional lingering damage after the initial damage has been dealt. Any enemies (besides enemy Pyros) who are hit with the flamethrower are set on fire and receive gradual damage over time. Because of this, even if a burned enemy runs away, he may still die, so it is not always necessary to chase your enemies down."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use the compression blast to reflect projectiles and push enemies.",
          "description":"The flamethrower has a useful secondary fire (right mouse button) called the compression blast (or air blast) which has a variety of uses. Upon pressing the right mouse button, the flamethrower emits a blast of air that can blast enemies backward through the air, though it won't damage them. It can also reflect slow moving projectiles such as the Demoman's bombs, the sniper's arrows and the Soldier's rockets. Soldiers, in particular, are very vulnerable to their rockets being reflected back at their team, as reflected explosives mini-crit against their own team. The compression blast can also remove flames from a teammate. A sniper's jarate along with the crusader's crossbow arrows can be reflected as well. Use reflected jarate for a quick mini-crit kill! Note that the air blast is expensive in terms of ammo, using 20 ammunition per blast. The air blast uses the same ammo as your flamethrower, so use it with caution!"

          "headline":"Use the shotgun at medium-to-long ranges.",
          "description":"The shotgun is weaker than the flamethrower, but much longer-ranged. Use this to your advantage. If an enemy is rushing toward you from a distance, it can help to switch to your shotgun and start shooting to inflict some damage before he or she is within the range of your flamethrower. This is especially true when you are about to enter combat with another Pyro because the burning damage of your flamethrower is negated. It's also smart to use your shotgun to pick off retreating enemies that are otherwise out of the range of your flamethrower. Try to ignite a player with your flamethrower and finish them off with the shotgun as he runs away. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/a5\\/Play-a-Pyro-in-Team-Fortress-2-Step-8.jpg\\/v4-460px-Play-a-Pyro-in-Team-Fortress-2-Step-8.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/a5\\/Play-a-Pyro-in-Team-Fortress-2-Step-8.jpg\\/aid243158-v4-728px-Play-a-Pyro-in-Team-Fortress-2-Step-8.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":288,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"455\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"

It can be very satisfying to score a melee kill with the axe, but, until you run out of ammo, it's better to use the flamethrower at melee ranges, as it almost always deals higher DPS. Some of the unlockable axes have more versatile uses (see below)."

It's intimidating, but you'll probably be gunned down before you can even singe another player. Instead, try to sneak up behind a group of enemies, get up as close as you can, and then let your flamethrower rip!"

Apart from an oncoming Heavy, nothing is more intimidating to an enemy than a set of flames that continues to damage him or her after you are out of the way. As such, you'll find that players tend to scatter and run from you, which helps to keep the enemy team from executing cohesive strategies."

If you separate the two by enough distance, the medic will no longer be able to share his uber with his buddy and your teammates will be able to gang up to finish both off. Do this when the uber players don't see you coming, as an uber-ed Heavy will make short work of an oncoming Pyro."

A flare fired arcs down when travelling through a long distance, and flies pretty slowly through the air, so hitting anything that is moving may be quite difficult. This is useful for hitting stationary or slow targets like Snipers or Heavies. Most enemies though, when seeing a Pyro with a little flare gun trying to hit them, assumes low threat towards the Pyro, as opposed to him using the Flamethrower. The flare gun also has a 100% critical chance against burning opponents. A critical flare deals 90 damage, which can be devastating to any class."

          "headline":"Use the flare gun at long ranges to take out sentries.",
          "description":"One of the biggest advantages of the flare gun is that it allows the Pyro - traditionally one of the shortest-ranged classes - to attack from long ranges. This allows a cautious, accurate Pyro to take out sentries that aren't accompanied by an engineer, which the Pyro would otherwise have no way of doing. Level 1 sentries will take about 5 hits from the flare gun to hit, while higher-level sentries will take more hits. Watch out for spies. Taking a sentry out with flares can take a relatively long time, during which you'll be vulnerable to a well-placed back stab."

The tradeoff for this is a huge increase in the cost of your air compression blast (From 20 to 50), so you may want to use it more frugally. If you're using this weapon, you ideally want to attack your enemies from behind, so this weapon encourages a stealthy style of play."

This can also be useful in some situations, like if you manage to approach a firing Heavy from behind without him seeing you, you can give him a quick puff from the Flamethrower, whip out your Axtinguisher, and hack into him. This should usually kill him in about two swings, whereas the normal ax would take much longer."
