For potatoes with a touch, starchy skin such as russet potatoes or Yukon gold potatoes, you might want to peel. For new potatoes or red potatoes, which have thinner skins, you can leave the skin on or peel it off. Find bunches of fresh parsley or buy a jar of dried parsley.

The instructions in the cooking section will call for butter, but you can substitute margarine if you prefer. Have some salt and pepper on hand so you can season your potatoes once they are cooked and ready to serve.  Cooking Parsley Potatoes Wash 2 lbs. (907 g) of potatoes. Place them in a colander and clean them with cold water. Peel the potatoes if you decide to cook them without skin.  Chop the potatoes into bite sized pieces with a sharp knife. Keep the potatoes whole if you are using a smaller potato, such as a new potato. Those will not need to be chopped. Place the potatoes in a large pot. Cover the potatoes with water and heat them at a medium high setting. Let them boil for 15 to 25 minutes. Stick a knife into the potatoes while they are cooking to determine if they are done. When the knife goes through the potato, you know they are finished cooking. Turn off the heat and pour the potatoes back into the colander to drain.  Melt 1/4 cup (2 oz.) of butter in the pot while the potatoes drain. Add parsley to the butter. If you are using fresh parsley, add 1 tbsp. (0.5 ounces) and if you are using dried parsley, add 1 tsp. (0.17 oz.). Stir the parsley into the melted butter. Put the potatoes back into the pot and use a large spoon to mix them with the butter and parsley. Add more parsley if you want a stronger herb flavor. You will have to taste the potatoes to judge whether you have enough. Sprinkle salt and pepper on the potatoes.
