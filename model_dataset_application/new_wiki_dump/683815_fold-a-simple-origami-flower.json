  "text":" Folding a Fortune Teller Fold your paper in half diagonally, both ways. (This step, and the next one, are optional, but it the next two steps a little bit easier) Fold it in half like a card. Both ways. Fold all the corners to the middle. (this is where steps 2 and 3 help you) Repeat.  Turn over and repeat.  Fold the paper in half both ways just to give it a little shape. Let's call the side you just folded the 'top side' and the side with the two sets of corners folded to the middle the 'bottom side'. Have the top side facing you and the bottom side down. Look at the flaps on the bottom side. Stick your fingers into these and push them all to the middle. (index and thumb is easiest) Take your fingers out of it. You should be looking at something like this. This is a completed fortune teller. The next steps tell you how to turn it into a flower. Look at the flaps you stick your fingers under. Fold each one of the points at the bottom on these up to the points at the top. Finishing the Origami Flower Fold both pieces onto the underside and crease it. (at about this time in the folding, a hole may start to form in the middle, which is just from all the wear-and-tear to the paper) Turn it over and fold the two flaps out a little until you can see four small ones in the center.  Adjust the small flaps in the middle. Fold them back and tuck them under themselves, making a white square appear in the center (make sure you do this well - they come untucked easily). Turn it over and fold the flaps out to make this - and your finished! Finished. ",
