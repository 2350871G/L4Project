Some are specialty brands that are fairly expensive, while others are more common brands. They may have special flavors, seasonings or stuffings. Buy pre-cooked bratwurst from a grocery store. Pre-cooked bratwurst is readily available at grocery stores and is usually available in packages of 6-8 sausages. This kind may be smoked or otherwise seasoned with spices. Make your own bratwurst. Making your own bratwurst can be a great way to customize the ingredients and flavors in your bratwurst. This is a time-consuming process, however, that requires equipment such as a meat grinder and sausage stuffer. In addition, you need sausage casings and room to dry and store the sausages. See the wikiHow article, \u201cMake Sausage.\u201d Buy enough bratwurst. Plan on at least one brat per person. Many people will likely want second helpings, so buying extra is usually a good idea. Boiling Bratwurst Put water and bratwurst in a pot or deep pan. Make sure your pan is deep enough that the brats will be covered in water. Place the bratwurst in the pan. Try to not let them overlap. Giving more room is better for cooking the bratwurst. Alternately, you can add half water and half beer to the pan for added flavor. Boil the bratwurst for about 20 minutes. Turn the pan to medium-high heat and let the water heat up to a boil. Once it gets to a boil, turn down the heat so that it doesn\u2019t overboil or ruin the bratwurst. If you boil the sausage at a slower, gentler boil, you will have better bratwurst. If you are cooking pre-cooked bratwurst, you just need to heat them up, rather than making sure they are cooked through as you would with raw bratwurst. Throw them on the grill to finish cooking if desired. Grilling the brats will help finish them off and give them a nice flavor. Put them on the grill with a pair of tongs and grill them for 5-10 minutes, turning them over at least once to make sure they cook on both sides. They will be browned from the grill and ready to serve. You can also grill your brats first for 5-10 minutes on each side, and then boil them. If you do this process, boil them for about 20 minutes after grilling. Check the internal temperature. Check the internal temperature of the bratwurst by using a meat thermometer and making sure the brats are about 160 \u00b0F (71 \u00b0C). Poaching Bratwurst in Beer Assemble your ingredients. In order to poach bratwurst in beer, you will need to assemble your ingredients and have everything on hand before you start. You will need:\nBratwurst: use as many as will fit into your pan or as many as you plan to serve\nOne medium-sized white, yellow or sweet onion\n6 ounces of dark beer Chop 1 onion. Use 1 medium-sized white, yellow or sweet onion. Chop the onion into rings. These will cook with the bratwurst, giving a nice flavor and companion to the sausage. Melt butter in a pan with a heavy bottom. Use either a heavy skillet or a Dutch oven to cook the brats and onions. Turn the burner on a medium high heat. Melt about 1 tablespoon of butter and make sure the butter covers the entire bottom of the pan. Add the onions. Brown the onions in the butter for 1-2 minutes. Stir them frequently to make sure they are browned on all sides. Some recipes suggest cooking the onions after you cook the bratwurst, so that you can monitor the bratwurst more effectively and so that you don\u2019t risk overcooking the onions. Add bratwurst to the pan. Cook the bratwurst with the onion for 2 minutes. Then turn over the bratwurst using tongs and let them cook for another 2 minutes. Both sides should be nicely browned. Add beer to the pan. Slowly pour 6 ounces of dark beer (about half a regular sized bottle) into the pan. Cover the pan with a lid. Turn down the burner\u2019s heat to medium to medium-low. Allow this to cook with the bratwurst and onions for approximately 15 minutes. The beer will poach the bratwurst, adding good flavor to the sausage. Finish off the brats on the grill. Remove the brats from the pan using a pair of tongs, and put them on a plate. Transfer them to a pre-heated grill. Let them cook for 5-7 minutes, turning them over at least once halfway through the cooking time. Remove the brats from the grill. Take the brats off the grill with tongs and place them on a serving plate. Dish up the onions on the same plate. Alternately, you can use a casserole dish or the Dutch oven to serve the bratwurst. Cooking on the Grill Don\u2019t use extremely high heat. Your bratwurst will probably char and crack open if you place them on the highest possible heat immediately. Furthermore, they will probably still be raw in the middle. Give them a chance to heat up a little more slowly on the grill. Don\u2019t use very low heat. If you use very low heat and try to cook the bratwurst, you might get overcooked interior meat. In addition to having to cook it for a long time, the bratwurst might look like it\u2019s done on the outside but has cooked too long. It will shrivel up when it cools. Use a disposable aluminum pan to poach bratwurst first. Use the heat of the grill to poach the bratwurst before putting them directly on the grill. Get a disposable aluminum pan at the grocery store. Put your bratwurst in these, along with some chopped onion, red or green peppers, or other vegetables. You can also put a bed of sauerkraut in the bottom of the aluminum pan. Pour some beer over the brats (about 6 ounces) and let this simmer with the grill lid down for about 15 minutes. Check the internal temperature of the brats with a meat thermometer. They should be about 160 \u00b0F (71 \u00b0C). Remove the brats and place them directly on the grill for about 5-7 minutes. Be sure to turn them over about halfway through the grilling time. Place the brats on the grill. Use a medium setting heat on the grill. Let the brats cook for a few minutes on one side. Turn them over and let them cook for a few more minutes. If you have not poached or boiled the brats before grilling them, then you\u2019ll need to grill them for about 25 minutes total. Be sure to turn them over a few times while they cook to ensure they are cooked on all sides. Do not poke holes in the bratwurst, as this will let all the juice escape from the casing and result in a dry bratwurst. Don\u2019t crowd the bratwurst together. If there are too many bratwurst on the grill, you raise the potential for causing a flare-up or grease fire. Spread out the bratwurst and give them some room to cook. Spritz the bratwurst with water or beer. As the bratwurst are cooking, you can spritz them with water or beer to keep them from burning. Put water or beer in a spray bottle. Carefully and quickly spray the liquid over the bratwurst. Alternately, you can brush water or beer on them with a pastry brush. Remove the brats from the grill. Use a pair of tongs to remove the brats and place them on a plate. Do not use the same plate that held the raw bratwurst, so that you don\u2019t risk cross-contamination. Check the internal temperature with a meat thermometer to make sure they are around 160 \u00b0F (71 \u00b0C). Baking in the Oven Preheat your oven to 350\u02daF/177\u02daC . Turn it on and let it preheat for about 10 minutes. Put brats on a broiler pan. Make sure there is a little room around each brat. Line them up to be perpendicular to the grates on the broiler pan. You can also use a cast-iron skillet instead of a broiler pan. Be sure to rotate the brats every 5 minutes to prevent them burning on one side. Put the brats in the oven for 5 minutes. Place the broiler pan on an oven rack and close the oven. Let the brats cook for about 5 minutes. Turn the brats every 5 minutes. After 5 minutes have passed, open the oven and use an oven mitt to hold onto the broiler pan. Use tongs to turn over each brat. Put the pan back in the oven for another 5 minutes, and then turn the brats again. Cook the bratwurst for a total of 15-20 minutes. If you don\u2019t rotate your brats, you will risk burning them. Check the bratwursts to see if they\u2019re done. Use a meat thermometer and poke into one bratwurst so that the tip of the thermometer rests in the middle of the bratwurst. It should reach 160 \u00b0F (71 \u00b0C). Broiling in the Oven Move the rack in your oven to the topmost spot. In order to broil food, the oven rack must be about 4-7 inches from the heat element in the ceiling of the oven. If your broiler is a compartment underneath your oven, then you can skip this step. Preheat the broiler in your oven. Most broilers just turn on or off. You can\u2019t control the temperature the way you do with normal oven cooking. Turn it on and let it preheat for about 10 minutes. Put brats on a broiler pan. Cover the broiler pan with aluminum foil and place the brats on the pan. Make sure there is a little room around each brat. Line them up to be perpendicular to the grates on the broiler pan. You can also use a cast-iron skillet instead of a broiler pan. Be sure to rotate the brats every 5 minutes to prevent them burning on one side. Cook the brats for 5 minutes on each side. Place the broiler pan on an oven rack and close the oven. Let the brats cook for about 5 minutes. Turn them over and cook them for another 5 minutes. Check the internal temperature. Remove the brats from the oven. Use a meat thermometer to check the temperature of the bratwurst. The bratwurst should reach 160 \u00b0F (71 \u00b0C). Stick the tip of the thermometer into one bratwurst and let the thermometer sit for a minute. The brats will also have brown stripes from the grates on the broiler pan. Smoking Bratwurst Heat up your smoker. Smoking meats is a very different process from grilling on a barbecue or cooking on a stove. Smoking involves lower temperatures and longer cooking times. Heat up your smoker to about 200 \u00b0F (93 \u00b0C). Follow your manufacturer\u2019s instructions to get the smoker ready for use, such as adding water and smoke flavoring. Some people like to cook bratwurst at a higher temperature, such as 250 \u00b0F (121 \u00b0C), while others aim for a much lower temperature, starting at 100F for an hour, then raising to 125F and 150F. These lower temperatures will mean it will take you much longer to cook the brats. Hickory or applewood smoke is a good flavor for smoked bratwurst. Use tongs to place bratwurst inside the smoker. Line up the bratwurst inside the smoker and be sure to give each wurst a little room. Be careful not to puncture or tear the casings on each brat. Brats will cook more slowly on the bottom rack than on the top rack. Smoke the bratwurst for 2 to 2.5 hours. Leave the smoker to cook the bratwurst for 2 to 2.5 hours. You don\u2019t need to flip over the bratwurst halfway through. Rather, leave them alone for at least 2 hours. Every time the door to the smoker opens, the smoker loses a little heat and you\u2019ll have to cook a little longer. Adjust your cooking time if you are smoking at a lower temperature than 200F. Check the bratwurst\u2019s internal temperature. After about 2 hours, use a meat thermometer to check the temperature of the bratwurst. The bratwurst should reach 160 \u00b0F (71 \u00b0C). It\u2019s best to use the same bratwurst every time to check the temperature. Every time you puncture it with a thermometer, some juices will escape and will make that bratwurst less than perfect. Remove the bratwurst. Use tongs to take the bratwurst out of the smoker. Set them on a plate. Be sure to use a different plate than the one you may have used to load them in. You want to avoid cross-contamination between raw bratwurst and cooked bratwurst. Cooking in a Microwave Place bratwurst in a microwave safe dish. Only put a few bratwurst in at a time. This will ensure that each wurst has enough room around it to cook thoroughly. Cover bratwurst with water. Fill the dish with enough lukewarm water to cover them. This will ensure that the bratwurst don\u2019t dry out as they are cooking. The water will boil while it\u2019s cooking, so you want to make sure you have enough that it won\u2019t boil away as you\u2019re cooking. Cook on high for 2 minutes. The microwave will cook the bratwurst very quickly, but you won\u2019t be able to adjust the heat while they are cooking. Cook the bratwurst for 2 minutes only so that they don\u2019t burn on one side. Cook according to your microwave\u2019s manufacturer instructions. Some cooking times may vary depending on the microwave. Turn wurst over and cook for 2 more minutes. Use tongs to grab the bratwurst and turn them over. Space them out so they have enough room to thoroughly cook. Cook on a high setting for 2 more minutes. Be careful, as the dish may be very hot. Use oven mitts to take the dish out of the microwave. Check the bratwursts to see if they\u2019re done. Use a meat thermometer and poke into one bratwurst so that the tip of the thermometer rests in the middle of the bratwurst. It should reach 160 \u00b0F (71 \u00b0C). Alternately, you can cut into the bratwurst with a knife to check if it\u2019s done. If it is still pink, put it back in the microwave for one more minute on a high setting. Storing Bratwurst Store raw or pre-cooked bratwurst in the fridge. Keep bratwurst in its packaging until you are ready to eat it. Store unopened packaging in the fridge until the expiration date printed on its packaging. If the package has already been opened, place the bratwurst in an airtight container and store in the fridge. Raw bratwurst can last for 2-3 days in the fridge if already opened. Pre-cooked bratwurst can last for 4-5 days in the fridge if already opened. Store raw or pre-cooked bratwurst in the freezer. If the packaging has not been opened yet, store bratwurst in the freezer for up to 2 months. Be sure to put the package in the freezer before its expiration date. Write the date that you stored it on the container so that you can keep track of its expiration date. If the package has already been opened, store bratwurst in a freezer-safe container for up to 2 months. If you want to store the bratwurst for longer than 2 months, wrap the original package in heavy-duty aluminum foil, making sure that it is wrapped airtight. You can also use a heavy-duty freezer bag. This will prevent freezer burn. Store cooked bratwurst. Allow cooked bratwurst to cool to room temperature. Place the bratwurst in an airtight container and keep in the fridge. Cooked bratwurst can last for about 5 days in the fridge. You can also store cooked bratwurst in the freezer for up to 3 months in the freezer. Write the date that you stored it on the container so that you can keep track of its expiration date. Cook up a large batch of bratwurst and freeze it. This will make it easy to cook meals quickly with delicious bratwurst. Do not store raw bratwurst in the same container as cooked bratwurst. Finished. ",
