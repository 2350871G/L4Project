          "description":"Most types of running bamboo are the hardiest varieties of bamboo that exist, and they need lots of sun to grow well. The area where you\u2019re planting your bamboo should get at least 6 hours and up to 10 hours of sun a day."

          "headline":"Measure out your planting plot.",
          "description":"The area where you plant your bamboo should measure at least 3 ft (1 meter) by 10 ft (3 meters) to accommodate the rhizomes of the plant and allow for their growth. Running bamboo will grow to fill whatever space it has, so you can also make your planting area larger. Your planting area doesn\u2019t have to be in the shape of a rectangle. An oval or circle also works well for bamboo. An oval should be at least 3 ft (1 meter) wide at its widest point and at least 10 ft (3 meters) long. A circle should be at least 10 ft in diameter. If you\u2019re planting in a container, choose it based on how wide you want the bamboo to grow. The planter should be at least 3 feet (1 meter) wide and 5 feet (1.5 meters) long. You can set several containers next to one another to extend the length of the planting area."

          "description":"Bamboo prefers loose soil, so the more you till your soil, the better. You should till down to a depth of 3 inches (7.5 cm). Make sure you break up any clumps in the soil. You can also till in a standard potting soil if your soil is a bit dry. You should use about half as much potting soil as the amount of soil it's being tilled into. Bamboo is pretty hardy, so you can use your favorite potting soil for this step."

After you\u2019ve buried the barrier around the perimeter of your planting area, compact the soil next to the barrier. The density of that soil will make it harder for the rhizomes to grow through."

Bamboo planted in a planter will likely not reach its full height. If you plant in a planter, you\u2019ll also need to divide or transplant the bamboo every 3 to 5 years to ensure it continues to stay healthy. If you decide to plant in a planter, you can follow the same directions as planting in soil \u2013 just make sure you place each plant in the center of the planter."

This problem usually affects older plants, and the best solution is to cut away the old growth to make way for the new growth. Sooty mold. This is due to the secretions of sucking pests, such as aphids. If you notice this problem, then you will need to do several applications of insecticide soap until the problem resolves. Root rot. This can kill the entire plant if it is not taken care of. If you notice that the roots are rotting, then you will need to cut away the plant from the roots and repot it. Bamboo mosaic virus.
