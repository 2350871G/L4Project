The liners make up the platform of your heel, so they should be color coordinated to your frosting and decorations. Buy coordinating sprinkles. Try something that matches the color of your frosting. You can also use toasted coconut. Mix your cake batter according to the package directions. Preheat your oven to the temperature specified. Line your cupcake pan with your colored cupcake liners.
