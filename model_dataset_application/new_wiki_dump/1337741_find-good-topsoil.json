In addition, check the surface of the soil for a light or white residue that may indicate the presence of salts or lime,  which are both chemicals that can have toxic effects on a garden or lawn. Extremely black topsoil indicates a lack of minerals in your soil. Look for something that\u2019s dark brown, but not black. If the topsoil you want to buy has already been packaged, ask the owner if he has any sample soil you can look at. If the soil is blue-green or gray, it means it\u2019s been continuously wet or saturated which is not good for topsoil. Avoid buying soil that looks like this."

          "description":"A quick run of your fingers through the soil will give you a good idea of what it\u2019s made up of. Good topsoil should crumble in your fingers. You should feel the grit in it which indicates minerals that are needed for your plants like phosphorus, magnesium, and calcium. Avoid soil that is too hard, as it indicates low organic matter. Soil that clumps up into balls or large chunks is too rich in clay. Topsoil that is heavy in clay interferes with plant\u2019s ability to aerate and stops water from effectively reaching the plant\u2019s roots. Look for large stones or weed roots which are also bad for topsoil."

Rub the sand around and pour a little more water over it while it's in your hand. As the sand becomes wet, you can physically feel for its properties. Gritty soil indicates high sand, smoothness indicates high silt, and stickiness indicates high clay. The sand should be dark and posses a combination of stickiness, grittiness, and smoothness. Ideally you don\u2019t want any one element dominating your topsoil. It should be an equal combination of all three. You can also see if your soil has any unwanted seeds while doing this.

This indicates unwanted and unnatural chemicals which can stop plants from growing, and makes for terrible topsoil. Topsoil takes hundreds of years to be created naturally, and decomposition should have already taken place. If the soil in question smells like rotting material, stay clear of it."

However, the very best place to get topsoil is at your local cooperative extension, which is sponsored by the US Department of Agriculture. Most of these extensions exist at local universities and specialize in creating the best topsoil with the highest nutrient count.

Having this information at the time of sale will save you time and money from having to test the soil yourself. This is different than the recipe and includes valuable information about the different chemicals in your soil. Avoid soils with a pH value less than 4.5 or greater than 7.0 because these levels are not ideal for growing most plants. Soluble salts absorb water and prevent it from getting to your plant's roots. Ideal topsoil should have less than 0.5 mmhos/cm for soluble salts test performed using a 1:2 soil:water ratio."

Nitrogen promotes plant growth and produces chlorophyll, Phosphorus promotes root, fruit, flower, and seed production, and potassium regulates water intake and the movement of sugars within a plant.
