Do not plant perennials while there is a chance of hard frosts or temperatures dip below 25 degrees F (-3.89 degrees C). Plant perennials in the summer, but do not allow the plants to dry out. If you choose to plant perennials in the summer, water the plants daily for 2 to 3 weeks. Plant perennials in the fall before the first frost. Perennials planted after the first frost typically do not survive because their root systems do not have time to get established before the ground freezes. Research a specific perennial to determine when its ideal planting time is. The best time to plant perennials varies depending on the species. Consult a gardening guide or ask a professional at a local garden center about the best time to plant a specific perennial plant. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/3\\/32\\/Plant-Perennials-Step-1Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Plant-Perennials-Step-1Bullet3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/3\\/32\\/Plant-Perennials-Step-1Bullet3.jpg\\/aid2005766-v4-728px-Plant-Perennials-Step-1Bullet3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"

Examine each perennial before purchasing. Choose perennials that look fresh and vigorous. Avoid leggy or floppy plants. Inspect the plant for indication of insect damage or disease, such as broken stems, bent leaves or withered leaves. If a perennial is infested with a foliage disease, it could spread into your garden and damage other plants. Plant the Perennials Remove the perennial from the growing container. Hold the container upside-down and shake it lightly to loosen the perennial's roots. Gently pull the plant from the container. Examine the root ball. If many roots are visible, the plant is likely rootbound. To force new growth in a rootbound plant, slice off the bottom 1/2-inch (1.27-cm) of roots using a sharp knife. With your fingers, break up the root ball by separating the roots along the side of the root ball. If you don't break up a rootbound plant, the roots may continue a circular growth pattern and stunt the plant's growth. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/77\\/Plant-Perennials-Step-10Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Plant-Perennials-Step-10Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/77\\/Plant-Perennials-Step-10Bullet1.jpg\\/aid2005766-v4-728px-Plant-Perennials-Step-10Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Dig a hole for the perennial. Using a shovel or garden trowel, dig a hole that is slightly wider and the same depth as the perennial container. If the perennial is planted too deep, the plant will experience stress and may not thrive. Place the perennial in the hole. Using a garden trowel or your hands, fill in around the plant with soil. Gently tap down the soil around the plant using your hands. The root ball should be even with or slightly below the surface of the garden soil. Water the perennial thoroughly. Water immediately after planting. Examine the plant each day for about 2 weeks while the roots become established. Make sure the soil around the plant is moist and that the perennial isn't wilting. Most perennials need daily watering during the first week, and every other day during the second week. Perennials planted during the summer may require more frequent watering. Care for Perennials Water regularly. Because there are so many different species of perennials, watering requirements vary based on the specific plant. Keep the soil around the perennials moist, but not soggy. To prevent fungal diseases, water in the morning or early afternoon. Mulch around the perennial. Mulch will hold moisture in the soil and prevent weeds from growing. Apply 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 cm) of mulch around the plants. Do not allow the mulch to actually touch the stem or branches of the plant or it may reduce air circulation necessary for healthy growth. Fertilize the perennial. If the soil is rich and amended with organic matter, fertilizing may not be necessary. Otherwise, fertilize with either a slow release granular or liquid fertilizer as needed. Do not over fertilize perennials, which can cause root injury or kill the plants. Stake tall perennials. Some taller perennials, such as delphiniums, peonies, phlox and hollyhocks, may require staking. To support the stems, place wooden stakes in the ground and tie stems to the stakes with twine. Remove spent blooms to encourage repeat blooming. Regularly deadhead faded flowers to keep the plants looking healthy and promote new blooms. Cut back perennials to promote new growth. Perennials may start to look scruffy or leggy after blooming. Most late spring and early summer perennials benefit from clipping after blooming. Divide perennials every 2 to 3 years. Perennials will continue to grow larger each year, but their continued growth may cause crowding in a garden. To keep the plants healthy, dig perennials out of the ground and split them into smaller chunks. The best times to divide perennials is in the early spring or fall.",
