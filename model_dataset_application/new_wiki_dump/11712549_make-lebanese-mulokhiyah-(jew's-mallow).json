          "description":"Start off by rinsing off the chicken and then place it in a large pot. It is the cook's choice whether to use a whole chicken or boneless breasts. Pour enough water in the pot to cover the chicken and let it boil. As the water begins to boil, remove the scum (white foam) from the surface of the pot using a straining spoon. Since the boneless breasts have less fat, there will not be a big presence of foam on the surface of the pot. However, a whole chicken has more fat than the boneless breasts. To remove all the fat from the whole chicken, take a fork and pierce it into the chicken and continue to strain the scum from the surface. This dish can also be made using beef stew meet instead of boneless breasts or whole chicken. You will follow the same steps as well."
