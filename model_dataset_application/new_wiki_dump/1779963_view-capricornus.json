Capricornus is visible roughly from July through November. View Capricornus in winter and spring from the southern hemisphere. If you are in the southern hemisphere, the seasons occur at in different months. That means, that July through November corresponds to the winter and spring seasons. These same months are when you should look for Capricornus in the southern hemisphere. Learn the times that Capricornus is at its peak. Capricornus peaks at different times depending on the month.

Looking In the Right Place Look to the south in the northern hemisphere. When gazing up at the sky, it is easy to be overwhelmed by the number of stars. Narrow your view to just the stars you can see when facing south. This southern sky is where you will find the sea goat, Capricornus. Set your gaze north from the southern hemisphere.
