To make them:\nCut a square of old rug. This is ideal for oddly shaped furniture, and items without discreet legs small enough to fit on a standard cup. Old clothes or towels can also be used this way. Cut a tennis ball in half, so that you have two tennis \u201cbowls\u201d. If the legs of your furniture are small enough, you can rest them inside the half-ball. The felt-and-rubber construction of the ball should protect your floor from scratches and scuffs."
