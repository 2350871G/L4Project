Choose whichever feels more comfortable to you. Some people hold both needles with only the right or the left hand, and then use their free hand to wrap the yarn around the needles. Others prefer to keep holding the needles in both hands and then wrap the yarn around the needle with their right hand while the right hand still holds the right needle.

Slowly pull the right needle all the way through then bring the right needle up, so that it's on top of the left needle. Don't pull too hard or you will pull the needle right out. Make sure to keep the yarn in your hand taut so that the yarn you wrapped around the right needle doesn't loosen as you pull it through the loop. Make sure that the yarn you wrapped around the right needle stays on the needle as you pull it through the loop. When you have completed this step, the right needle is in front of the left needle."

Cast on your stitches. Before you begin knitting, cast-on as many stitches as your pattern requires. After the cast-on stitches are ready, make sure the first stitch is one inch from the top of the needle. Knitting the Garter Stitch Hold the needles in the starting position. Begin garter stitch by holding the needle with the cast-on in your left hand and the other needle in your right hand. Hold the yarn in your right hand. Make sure the left needle tip is pointing towards the right. Push the tip of the right needle into the first loop on the left needle. Push the needle into the loop from the bottom to the top.

Continue knitting. Knit all the cast-on stitches in the same way until there are no more cast-on stitches on your left needle. When all the stitches are on your right needle, you have finished your first row of knitting. Switch the needles in your hands. Your left hand should be the one holding all the stitches. You are now ready to start knitting your second row in exactly the same way as the first. When you turn your material, the yarn hanging out of the first stitch should be in the front. What you have just finished, including the cast-on, is considered row 1.",
