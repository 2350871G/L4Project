You can do this by allowing the sink to fill with water and then draining it, or using your hand to splash water around on the sides of the basin. Make sure that no standing water is left in the sink, as this will dissolve the baking soda and render it useless. Also dampen the sponge that you plan to clean the sink with. You don\u2019t want the sponge soggy, so wring it out well before you start cleaning."

Rinse the sponge as needed, and make sure to wring it out fully before you return to scrubbing the ceramic. Once you\u2019ve cleaned the sink, rinse it well with water. While you\u2019re scrubbing, you should notice the baking soda clumping together into small lumps. This is a good sign: it means that the baking soda is not too wet, and that it\u2019s effectively picking up dirt from your sink."

Take each wedge and rub it around the basin of the sink, making sure to squeeze out plenty of lemon juice on the ceramic. You can use the tough skin of the lemon to scrub at stains or other darkened areas. You\u2019ll need to use at least four or five lemon slices to fully coat the ceramic with lemon juice."

          "description":"In an empty plastic spray bottle, combine a 1:1 solution of bleach and water. Lightly shake the bottle to mix the solution. Open the window or turn on your bathroom fan before you start spraying the bleach solution, as this will provide ventilation. Then, spray the bleach solution over the entire interior surface of the ceramic sink. Let the bleach mixture sit and soak for about 10 minutes. Then, use a sponge or an old rag to wipe the sink clean. Bleach is a strong chemical and can be very harmful if ingested or sprayed in the eyes. Use caution when spraying bleach, consider wearing safety goggles or at least rubber gloves, and wear clothing that you don\u2019t care about. If there are young children in your house, make sure that they\u2019re not near the sink when you\u2019re spraying bleach.
