  "text":" Setup To be able to play KEMPS you will need: One large table, preferably circle but any even-sided table will do. Table must be large enough so that partners can't touch each other from across the table. At least one standard deck of 52 cards,\nExactly 4 players and 1 dealer. The four players must pair up to form 2 teams. The 2 partners must sit directly across from each other and perpendicular to the other team. Objective The objective of KEMPS is for at least you or your partner to get all 4 of a kind, KEMPS.  To win the round, when a player has four of a kind their partner has to call out \"KEMPS\". After winning a round, you get a letter of the word KEMPS. The game is won when a team collects all 5 letters. If a player calls KEMPS and their partner doesn't have only EXACTLY 4 of a kind in their hand then other team gains a letter.  If you and your partner both have KEMPS in your hands, then you and your partner can call out \"Double KEMPS\" to win 2 letters.  If you believe that a player on the other team has 4 a kind then you can call \"Counter KEMPS\" to win the round, the other team loses a letter. To successfully call counter KEMPS, at least one player on the opposing team must have exactly only 4 of a kind in their hand. How To Play A player or the dealer must shuffle the deck and deal each player 4 cards face-down. The deck is then held by the dealer. To start the game the dealer must flip 4 cards face-up on the table. The cards must be either all in the middle of the table or one in front of each player. The players can only touch the cards when all four are touching the table. If a player touches the cards too early then the touched cards must be put back in place until the fourth card touches the table. Players can discard any cards or pass any cards to their partner that they choose as long as they are face-up on the table. The other players may take or snatch any cards that are touching the table even if another player is touching them this applies to cards that fall on the floor as well. All players must then agree to discard 4 cards. Discarded cards are removed from play for the rest of the round. More cards can only be flipped when 4 cards are discarded and each player has 4 cards in their hand. The dealer can flip the cards when all players are ready. Repeat these steps until a team wins the round. If all cards are flipped and discarded and no player has called KEMPS yet then the match may be a draw. If players believe that the match is a draw then they should show their cards to the dealer to determine if the match is in fact a draw. In a draw, no team gains a letter. Other Rules Players can only show cards to their partner if they don't have KEMPS but players can pass their partner KEMPS face-up across the table.  Cards can only be passed face-up. If any cards are passed face-down they must be returned to the player who passed them. Players can not snatch cards out of another player's hands unless they are in contact with the table as well.  If a player calls KEMPS and their partner has more than 4 cards in their hand or doesn't have 4 of a kind then the opposing team wins the letter. ",
