Choose one of these delicious flavors, or make up your own:\nLemon lime. This classic flavor combination is refreshing, and even more so when you create it yourself using fresh limes and lemons. Vanilla cream. Another soda counter favorite, this smooth, rich soda is delicious any time of year. You'll need whipping cream and vanilla extract. Chocolate. Chocolate soda is surprisingly easy to make - all you need is some chocolate syrup, and you're good to go. Tropical punch. Buy some mangoes, pineapples, and kiwis, or skip the whole fruit and just buy a variety of juices to make your tropical soda."

You can stick with plain sugar or go with a different flavor like honey, agave nectar, or even molasses. Choose a sweetener that matches the soda flavor you designed. Soda made with fruit won't need as much sweetener as other types of soda, since the fruit itself provides a lot of the sweetness. Pair vanilla and chocolate sodas with maple syrup for an interesting twist. Make diet soda by using a sugar substitute."

Mix in some sweetener, then stir the entire concoction with a large spoon. Serve immediately or store in a capped bottle for later use. Taste the soda as you add flavorings and sweetener to determine how much more you want to add. Serve the drink in clear glasses with straws to show off its pretty colors and the sparkling bubbles. Homemade soft drinks make a great party treat."
