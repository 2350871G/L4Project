Do not open the tin until you are ready to eat it, as this will decrease its shelf life. It is a good idea to only purchase the amount you expect to eat in a single sitting. However, if you do have leftover caviar, return it to the original tin, place a piece of plastic wrap over the top, and close the tin securely.
