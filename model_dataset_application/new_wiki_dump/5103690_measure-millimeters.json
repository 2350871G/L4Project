The numbered lines correspond to centimeters, while the unmarked lines indicate millimeters. If you look closely, you\u2019ll notice that there are 10 millimeters in a centimeter. The medium-sized line at the halfway point between each numbered centimeter measurement represents half a centimeter, or 5 millimeters. This same labeling scheme is also used on longer metric measuring tools, such as meter sticks and tape measures."

If you\u2019re trying to find out how long your smartphone is in millimeters, you would arrange your ruler so that the \u201c0\u201d marking is even with one of the device\u2019s horizontal edges. Not all rulers have \u201c0\u201ds printed on them. If the one you\u2019re using doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s safe to assume that the end of the ruler to the left of the \u201c1\u201d indicates \u201c0mm.\u201d"

Multiplying this number by 10 will convert the unit of measurement to millimeters and tell you how long your object is in millimeters up to this point. If the last full centimeter measurement reads 1, multiplying it by 10 would give you 10, since 1cm = 10mm.Tip: One quick and easy way to multiply by 10 when you\u2019re working with integers (whole numbers) is to simply tack a \u201c0\u201d onto the end of the number."

The reason this is necessary is because there aren\u2019t enough millimeters to account for another full centimeter. Using the centimeter measurement to quickly calculate the bulk of the object\u2019s length in millimeters just saves time. If the object you're measuring is 1.5 centimeters, multiplying 1 times 10 gives you 10, and adding 5 gives you a total length of 15mm. If it\u2019s easier for you, you can also measure one centimeter past the end of your object and then subtract the number of millimeters in between. 2 centimeters (20 millimeters) minus 5 millimeters equals 15mm."

Translating inches to millimeters is a little tougher than making other conversions, since inches are imperial units and millimeters are metric.Tip: It should be fine to limit your final measurement to the numbers on the left side of the decimal point. If you need to be extra precise, round off to the nearest hundredth of a millimeter (the second number after the decimal)."

The same basic principle that makes it possible to convert inches and feet to millimeters also applies here. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so 12 x 25.4 = 304.8; a yard has 3 feet, so 304.8 x 3 = 914.4, and so on. It\u2019s well known that the field of play on an American football field is 100 yards.
