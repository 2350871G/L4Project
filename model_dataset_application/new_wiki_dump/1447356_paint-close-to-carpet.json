      "headline":"Clean the wall or trim thoroughly.",
      "description":"Mix 1 to 2 scoops of the cleaning agent trisodium phosphate into a bowl of water and mix. Scrub the trim or bottom of the wall you are painting with a sponge soaked in the mixture. Washing the area before applying paint with this degreasing product allows the paint to adhere more effectively to the wall. Allow the wall or trim to dry completely before you move onto the next step. This can take 2 to 5 hours."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Cover the entire floor with a plastic tarp.",
      "description":"Connect smaller segments of tarp into 1 large piece with masking tape. Stick heavy-duty double-sided tape onto the underside of the tarp and press the taped areas into the carpet. Lay heavy objects such as books or paperweights on top of the tarp to weigh it down."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Apply wide masking tape to the carpet against the baseboard.",
      "description":"Remove a long strip of wide painter's masking tape from the roll. Position the tape sticky-side down on the carpet as close to the wall as possible. None of the tape should touch the wall. Curl the edge closest to the wall inward. Perform the motion as if you were trying to curl the tape underneath the carpet. If done correctly, the tape should have pulled the carpet back away from the wall slightly, creating a small gap between the wall and the carpet. Take another strip of tape and place it perpendicular to the baseboard tape. Pull the perpendicular strip taut so the carpet is drawn away from the wall even more. Make sure the tape is secure."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Paint the wall.",
      "description":"Dip a small, clean paintbrush into your paint about halfway. Remove the excess paint by wiping it on a paint tray. You do not want the paintbrush to be dripping even slightly. Run the paintbrush along the bottom of the wall carefully. Stop periodically to check for drips or mistakes. Hold a cloth in the hand you aren't painting with so you can quickly fix any painting missteps along the way."
