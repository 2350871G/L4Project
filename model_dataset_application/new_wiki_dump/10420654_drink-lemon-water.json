          "description":"Slice the lemon thinly and then place it in a cup or pitcher. Pour filtered water over the slices to begin infusing the fresh lemon into the water immediately. It should take 5-10 minutes for the first hint of lemons to infuse into the water. Taste the water as it diffuses, and remove the lemons from the water when you\u2019ve reached your desired taste.Tip: Sometimes, lemon water can taste bitter due to the rind. If you don\u2019t like this taste, you can peel the lemon before infusing it or simply squeeze the juice from the lemon into the water. For a subtle lemon infusion, remove the lemons after only 5 minutes. For a more intense lemon flavor, leave the lemons in warm water for 30-45 minutes or 2-3 hours in cold water."

          "description":"Your body can become dehydrated overnight due to a loss of water. Have a glass or mug of lemon water first thing when you wake up to reap positive benefits, like increased energy in the morning. Lemon juice also contains important nutrients like potassium, which is an electrolyte that can prevent muscle cramping during physical activity. In addition to preventing cramping, potassium, which is found in many citrus fruits, also helps to maintain the body's fluid balance, leading to better hydration throughout the day. You can also use this time in the morning to relax and plan for your day."

          "description":"One of the negatives of drinking lemon water is that it contains a lot of citric acid, which can damage your tooth enamel. Make sure the straw is behind your teeth when you\u2019re drinking the water, or rinse your mouth with fresh water after you have lemon water.Tip: If you\u2019re going to drink lemon water everyday, invest in a reusable straw made of metal or purchase a package of paper straws. This will help to prevent unnecessary waste from disposable plastic straws, which aren\u2019t recyclable."
