Interesting stitching patterns, such as white embroidery, can introduce some much-needed texture to your bed. For example, if you have a white blanket or comforter, pick one that has a stitched pattern in white. The pattern could be as simple as wavy lines, but it could be more complicated, too\u2014anything from roses to stars or leaves."

You could also pick a throw with a crocheted pattern, such as one that has all-white granny squares. While you may think of crocheted throws as a winter accent, you can choose one in a lightweight knit to use in the summer as well."

You could also choose a box-stitched white comforter, meaning that squares are sewn along the comforter. It still looks puffy, but the sewn lines help hold the stuffing in place. To add visual interest, fold the comforter down so it lays across the bottom third or quarter of the bed."

For instance, try a patterned red comforter on top for some warmth. If you don't want that much color, try adding a white comforter that has a pattern on it in gray or white.

However, adding a pillow or 2 to the bed in colors from around the room can tie the room together. For example, if you have bright wallpaper, pick a couple of colors from the wallpaper, and choose pillows to match those colors.
