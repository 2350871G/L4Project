It should cast light on your keyboard or desk surface. One option for task lighting is to install a pendant light from the ceiling. These lights hang down from above, so that they cast a light over the spot of your choice. You should hire an electrician to wire pendant lights into your ceiling. Another option is to install a standing lamp or large desk lamp. As long as the lamps shed enough lighting across the desk, they can work well without requiring an electrician."

Modular desks are often sold in \"systems.\" They can be adjusted to the size and shape of your space. You may or may not use all the pieces in the system, but you can connect drawers to the main desk shape and choose elements that extend out from the wall if you have the space. Another great option is a roll-up desk. Unlike normal models, this traditional style of desk comes with a door that allows you to close it when not in use.

Place the electronics inside and print your documents wirelessly. Install pull-out shelves. Shelves that have runners give you easier access to the materials in the back. These can be installed in modular desk cabinets or in wall cabinets. Use a kitchen island as extra storage.
