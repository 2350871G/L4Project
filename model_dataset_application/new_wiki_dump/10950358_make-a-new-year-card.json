To make a typical size greeting card, use a 10 inches (25 cm) x 14 inches (36 cm) piece of cardstock. If you opt for a dark piece of cardstock, you will need a white or silver pen to write in the card. Lightweight cardstock works best, as heavy cardstock is harder to fold."

You could also print out a picture of your family pet or a favourite vacation photo. Be creative and express your unique style. If you don't have hot glue, use double-sided tape instead."

          "description":"Use glitter or sequins to create a border around your card. Alternatively, use the glitter or sequins to create a pattern on the card. This helps to give your card a bright and festive look. Place a thin layer of glue where you want the glitter and then sprinkle the sequins or glitter evenly over the area. A personal photo stuck on a card with a sequin border would look striking. For a simple but effective option, make a fireworks pattern with hot glue and then sprinkle glitter over it. This is a great on-theme look! To create a geometric look, stick sequins on your card in a geometric pattern, such as zig-zags or hexagons."

It can also be a great way to share any updates from the year and to let them know your plans for the year to come. If you prefer not to write by hand, type your message on the computer, print it out, and then stick it inside the card. For example, \u201cWe wish you a wonderful year to come. Looking to the year ahead, Jake is starting school and Ryan will start Grade 6. John and I are continuing our current jobs and are looking forward to a trip to Hawaii in April. Hope all is well with you and the family. Hope to see you all soon. Much love!\u201d"
