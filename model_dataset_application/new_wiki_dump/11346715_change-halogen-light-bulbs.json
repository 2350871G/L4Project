If you\u2019re ever in doubt as to whether the light is truly off or not, turn the power off using the fuse box to be sure. If you don\u2019t switch the power source off, you could get electrocuted or badly injured due to the running electricity in the light bulb. Look for the fuse box in your garage, basement, or closet. Sometimes they may be attached to your house outdoors. You can turn off the main power switch in the fuse box, which will be the largest switch. You can also cut the power to the specific room you're working in if your fuse box is labeled with each room."

Use a step stool or chair that props you up enough that you can see and reach the light bulb easily.

Do a quick touch test to see if the bulb is cool enough after the 10 minutes have passed. If changing your halogen light bulb requires you to unclip the bulb using a metal prong, it\u2019s best to wait 20 minutes for the metal to cool down."

Make sure you\u2019ve purchased the correct replacement for your light bulb, noting the specific type as well as the wattage of your old one. If you\u2019re not sure what type of halogen light bulb you have, unscrew it from its fixture and look for labeling that will tell you exactly what kind it is. The fixtures are often marked with stickers or other labels telling you the voltage, wattage, and specific type of halogen bulb needed. For example, G4 and G9 halogen bulbs are very small, while GU10 and MR16 light bulbs are larger and often found in ceilings around the house."
