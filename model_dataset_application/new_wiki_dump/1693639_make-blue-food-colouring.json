          "description":"Place an entire head of red cabbage onto a cutting board. Cut off the stem and discard it. Hold the cabbage steady with one hand, and with a large chef\u2019s knife, roughly chop the cabbage into small chunks. The cutting doesn\u2019t have to be precise, but smaller pieces are better because you'll get more color from the cabbage. Red cabbage contains anthocyanin, a purplish pigment that will dissolve in water. You can collect purple cabbage water to turn it into blue food coloring."

          "description":"Transfer the cabbage to a large saucepan. Cover the cabbage with enough water to cover it completely, about 8 cups (1.9 L). Put on the lid and bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. When the water comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium, and continue simmering for 20 minutes. As the cabbage boils, the anthocyanin will leach into the water, turning it purple."

The colander will catch the cabbage, and the purple water will drain into the bowl below. The cabbage is cooked and ready to eat. Set it aside to cool, and then use it in soups, stews, stir fries, and other dishes."

Continue simmering the water with the lid off for about 75 minutes to reduce the purple water. Cook the mixture until most of the water has evaporated and there's only \u00bd cup (118 ml) of liquid left.

Stir the mixture to dissolve the baking soda in the water, and allow the bubbles to subside if necessary. The purple pigment in the cabbage reacts differently with acids and bases. In an acidic environment, the anthocyanin will become redder. When you mix the anthocyanin with an alkaline ingredient like baking soda, it will become bluer."

You can also test the color on a small amount of frosting before dyeing the entire batch. Add a few drops of the food coloring and stir to incorporate the dye into the liquid. The color will be pale, but it will give you a good idea of the blue shade you\u2019ve achieved. The testing step is particularly important if you're going to use the dye to color frosting or something similar, because the pH of the frosting will alter the color of the dye."

Don\u2019t add more than \u00bd teaspoon (2.4 g) of baking soda. Otherwise, the food coloring will taste salty and metallic. The baking soda won\u2019t make the color darker, but it will make the dye bluer."
