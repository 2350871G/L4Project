These portable devices are battery operated so you can take them with you wherever you go. As you mist and fan yourself, the water is evaporated on your skin, giving you an instant cooling sensation."

The evaporation of the water will cool your head (though it may make your hair a bit frizzy if it's curly). Wear a bandana with water soaked on it and put it on your head."

Your body will stay cool for a long time after you get out. Take a cool shower rather than a bath, if you prefer. You could also soak your feet in a bucket of cold water. The body radiates heat from the hands, feet, face and ears, so cooling any of these will efficiently cool the body. Kiddie wading pools are great for adult feet too."

As soon as the sun hits your building in the morning, close all windows and keep exterior doors and windows closed throughout the hottest part of the day. Do this until night falls and it is cool enough to open the windows for the night. Angle your blinds up, so that if you are looking through them you can see the ground, not the sky. For even better protection, get cellular, insulated curtains, or window tint film, which, like car tint, looks like a dark or shiny part of the glass itself."

          "description":"Open strategic windows so that cooler night air is blowing in throughout the evening. Leaving all interior doors open (including closets and kitchen cabinets) helps, too. If you leave them closed, they store the daytime heat and your house won't cool off so quickly at night. Be sure to get up and close the windows and blinds as soon as the sunlight hits your house. This can be as early as 5-6 a.m. in some areas."

          "headline":"Cool down your home with fans.",
          "description":"Position a ceiling fan, an upstairs window fan, or an attic fan to draw off the heat collected in upper rooms and push the heat outdoors. Set up your portable fan so that the fan sucks up cooler air from the floor below, and blows hot air upwards towards the ceiling. Use a combination of fans to create good air circulation. Blow hot air out by positioning a powerful exhaust fan near a window and use oscillating fans placed near other windows to blow in fresh, cooler air. You can also turn on your stove ventilator hood fan or open up your chimney flue. These will also draw hot air out of the house and pull cooler evening air into the house."

          "description":"Put a metal bowl of salted ice in front of a fan, and adjust the fan so that the air is blowing over the ice. Or, use one or more 2 liter (0.5 US gal) bottles and fill them mostly full of water (70%) and rock salt (10%). Leave 20% of the volume empty for expansion. Freeze the liquid in the bottles, then place them in a large bowl (to catch dripping condensation). Position a fan to blow on them. As the salty ice in the bottles melts, the air around them cools and the fan will blow that air at you. The salt lowers the temperature at which the water freezes, allowing you to make the ice super cold. The water and salt in the bottles can be refrozen every night and used repeatedly."

Turn off your lamps and your computer when you're not using them. You should also turn off your TV since it gives off a lot of heat and take the power off of non-essential plug-in power adapters.

Install an individual room ventilation system with a cool air intake, hot air exhaust, and temperature and humidity controls. This will bring the night-time air in and let the A/C take over in the middle of the day."

To cool your house, open a door to the basement, and make sure that all doors between the basement and the room where the fan is located are open. Turn it on at night and open downstairs windows, and that will cool the house efficiently. However, make sure that you've got good attic vents, or your attic won't properly exhaust the heat. If you don\u2019t have them already, install attic vents. It's amazing how much difference a cool attic makes to the temperature of a house."
