Then, set the trap and place it near a hole or crack that you suspect the rodents use to enter your house, or in an area where you\u2019ve seen rodent droppings. Snap-style traps come in different sizes for mice and rats. Rat traps are about 3 times the size of mice traps. Although these traps do kill the rodent, they do so painlessly, unlike killing a rodent with less humane methods like poison."

Seal it, and place the bagged rodent into a second sealable bag. Seal the second bag and place the bagged rodent in the garbage.

Bait the live trap as you would a snap-style trap, and set it in an area where you\u2019ve seen rodent droppings. You can purchase live traps at most hardware stores or at large home-supply stores. Once you have a rodent in your trap, drive the animal at least 1 mile (1.6 km) from your home before releasing it. To release the rodent, set the cage in a meadow or field and open the trapdoor. Stand away from the cage until the rodent walks out. Then, collect the cage and return to your vehicle."

For example, you can rub peppermint oil on floorboards and other areas where rodents travel. You can also scatter fresh or dried mint leaves, as both the oil and leaves repel rodents. Use mothballs to keep mice out of hard-to-reach areas of your home. Put 4 or 5 mothballs in an open container and leave them in the corners of the basement, attic, and other areas of your home where rodents are a problem.

Give the adult cat a few weeks to settle in to its new home and rodent-hunting routine before you expect to see significant results. Keep in mind that adopting a cat is a serious responsibility.

Put the urine-soaked cat litter out in the basement or attic, in areas where you suspect the rodents are living. Leave the litter out for about a week to give it adequate time to drive away rodents.
