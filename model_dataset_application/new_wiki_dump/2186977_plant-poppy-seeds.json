While all poppies have colorful, papery petals and a slightly wild, weedy appearance, they also have striking differences when it comes to caring for them. Choose a variety that works best in your growing region and the conditions in your garden. California poppies grow best in USDA zones 9 - 11, the dry western regions of the US. They are easy to care for and do well in infertile soil. Purple poppy mallow is another variety that grows best in infertile soil, but this one grows best in zones 4 through 8. Corn poppies, on the other hand, need rich, fertile, wet soil to grow well. Celandine poppies are woodland flowers that grow best in the east, zones 4 through 8.

You can plant them along the borders of your yard, in a window box or in a chosen spot in your garden. Make sure the soil quality in the spot you choose matches the needs of your poppy. If you have a variety that does well in infertile soil, you're in luck - you don't have to add anything to your soil to get it ready. Many poppies grow perfectly well in rocky terrain that doesn't support other types of flowers as well. For varieties that require rich soil, till the soil and mix in rich compost or bone meal to add the nutrients your poppies need to thrive."

It's usually a safe bet to sow poppy seeds in very early spring, while there's still a good chance of frost. If you're in an area with mild winters, sow the seeds in the fall, so they get plenty of exposure to cooler temperatures before the weather warms up in the spring. After 14 to 28 days, the seeds will begin their germination, sending up shoots."

When you see them sprout, you can thin out the poppies to allow each plant a bit of room to grow. Different varieties will come with different instructions as to how much spacing they need. This step isn't totally necessary, but it can give you more control over the final appearance of your flower bed."
