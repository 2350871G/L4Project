          "description":"Start by determining whether you have the right kind of soil to allow clover to thrive. Most varieties of clover do best in soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0, although some do well in soil with a pH as high as 8.5. Purchase a soil testing kit from your local nursery or garden center. A soil testing kit can also tell you if your soil has any nutrient or mineral deficiencies. If your soil pH is too low, you can adjust it by adding lime to the soil. Correct a soil pH that is too high by mixing in peat moss or sawdust. You may need to allow up to 6 months for any adjustment to take full effect, so do your testing well in advance of when you want to plant. Get a type of clover that works best with your soil pH. Research clover varieties online, or check with your plant nursery or garden center."

          "description":"Before you plant clover, you will need to get rid of any unwanted plant growth. You may use a weed killer, to eliminate any existing turf, weeds, or other unwanted plants.Some types of weed treatments, such as systemic herbicides or chemical broadleaf treatments, may require you to wait up to two weeks before planting new ground cover. Follow all label directions carefully. If animals may feed on your clover, if you may allow the clover to flower for bees to pollinate, and if the area drains into existing groundwater, avoid using chemical compounds such as Roundup."

To remove all vegetation, rocks, and debris from the area, till or rake the soil to a depth of about eight inches (20 cm). Tilling a month in advance will give any weeds time to regrow so you can remove them before planting. Tilling now will also make it easier to change the soil if the pH needs to be adjusted."

Go over the area you've seeded with a rake that is turned so that the tines face up, and gently mix the seeds into the top layer of soil. Do not rake more than a quarter-inch (6 mm) deep, otherwise the seeds won't grow."

Provide the seeds with a light misting of water every day that it doesn't rain until the seedlings grow leaves. During the spring, summer, and warmer fall months, make sure the clover gets about 1.5 to 2 inches (3.8 to 5 cm) of water per week. When planted during the warmer spring or summer months, clover seeds will germinate in one to two weeks. Make sure that the seeds do not have a chance to dry out during the day, or the sprouts will not survive."

Adding in fertilizer will usually encourage grasses and weeds to grow instead of the clover. Use a testing kit to check whether your soil is missing any important nutrients before you plant, and adjust accordingly."

Inoculated clover seeds of any variety are also popular, because it means you don't have to inoculate them yourself.
