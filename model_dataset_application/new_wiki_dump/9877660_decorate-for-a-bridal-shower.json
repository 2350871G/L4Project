          "description":"Unless the shower is a surprise, it is a good idea to get as much input as possible from the bride. Traditionally, a bridal shower is for the bride, her bridesmaids, and other close female friends and family. She may want to stick to this tradition or she may want to include older family members, children, or even partners of her friends. This is valuable information when choosing a theme and deciding on your decorations. If there are going to be children there, for example, you will want to avoid decorating with precious, breakable items within their reach. You might also consider creating a designated space for them to gather and play."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Determine the shower's location.",
          "description":"The bride may feel strongly about hosting an event-style shower like a spa day or a horseback riding trip. Decorations for this type of shower are minimal and need to be portable and simple, so this is an important distinction to make up front. An event shower will save you money on decorations, but they are generally more expensive all around. The host is responsible for organizing the details, but the cost is generally split evenly between all of the participants except the bride."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Select a theme for the shower to give your decorations a focus.",
          "description":"This is optional and depends on the interests, style, and desires of the bride. Unless the shower is a surprise, ask the bride about her thoughts on a theme. When you discuss the theme with the bride, watch for her level of interest and enthusiasm when you discuss certain ideas. For example, she may not care very much about the colors you choose, but she suddenly becomes passionate when you talk about the flowers or a make-your-own cocktail bar. If the bride-to-be is stressed out, consider a spa day or a less expensive at-home self-care day that includes pedicures, facials, and yummy smoothies. For a movie buff, choose a film-inspired shower that includes champagne, popcorn, and several great movies."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Choose colors or a d\u00e9cor style as an alternative to a theme.",
          "description":"Even if you and the bride decide you don't want to adhere to a theme, designating colors and/or a particular style of d\u00e9cor can help keep your choices focused and coherent. Think of visual styles like shabby chic, rustic/nature, or modern art. If the bride is a French wine enthusiast, consider a French country look for your decorations. When in doubt, choose the colors of the wedding for the shower decorations. Alternatively, you could pick the bride\u2019s favorite color and create your look using different shades of that color with splashes of white mixed in."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Stick to your budget.",
          "description":"It is easy to go overboard on spending, especially when the party is for a beloved friend on a special occasion. That\u2019s why it is important to decide on an amount you are comfortable spending on decorations at the outset. Make sure you take into consideration any additional costs: food, alcohol, invitations, catering, or housecleaning just to name a few. It is perfectly acceptable to ask several other guests to co-host with you and share the expense. Pick one thing that you think the bride would really appreciate and splurge on that. For instance, if the theme is Marie Antoinette, go for it on the tarts and cakes, but commit to keeping other costs down. Look around your home to see if you already have things that might fit the theme. For example, if you are hosting a Kentucky Derby-themed shower, use your horse-head bookends to decorate the food table or bar."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Make or borrow some of the decorations to save money.",
          "description":"Handmade decorations tend to be more personal as well as less expensive. Enlist some of the other guests to get crafty with you. And don't be afraid to reach out and ask for items that you need. You may not have the perfect cupcake platter, but the bride\u2019s best friend from high school might! Banners, signs, and flags are great items to make by hand. Have each guest make a flower out of decorative paper with a note on the back. String these together to make the perfect banner for a garden party. Transfer pictures of the bride and groom to glass votive candles to create personalized ambiance and a bonus take-home gift. Stick with a time-honored tradition and make a memorable photo collage of the couple's history together. Get friends and family to donate to your collection of memories."

Attach helium balloons to your sign, the mailbox, or the porch for extra visibility. Match the balloon colors to the colors you\u2019ve used to decorate inside. Consider making a sign that fits the theme. If you\u2019ve chosen a film theme, for example, make your sign look like a marquee. A banner on the door could say the bride\u2019s name plus the groom\u2019s name or something simple like \u201clove\u201d or \"amour.\" If the party is at night, consider creating some ambiance with a string of outdoor lights around the door or the sign."

You don\u2019t need to do a complete overhaul of your usual d\u00e9cor. A few well-placed decorations can transform your space. Choose from balloons, streamers, fabric swaths, banners, or theme-specific images. Soften the space with swaths of light or sheer fabric hung from the ceiling with upholstery tacks, tape, or ceiling hooks. For a Roaring Twenties theme, create a festive mood with strands of shimmering beads in the entryway."

Cover the table with a pretty tablecloth that ties into the rest of your d\u00e9cor. Place a sign on the table to let your guests know it is for gifts. Resist the urge to add anything else to the table because it will just get moved! Use a tall, wire picture holder for your sign so it can still be seen once there are some gifts on the table. Make a banner or sign to designate the gift table. Hang it on the front of the table to save the space for gifts."

          "description":"Since everyone eventually congregates around the food table, make it the highlight of your shower\u2019s decorations. Splurge on the bride\u2019s favorite flowers to adorn the table. Choose platters of varying heights to make the most of your space and to create an eye-catching composition of the food. Add a framed photograph of the bride and groom. If you are hosting a potluck style shower, plan on re-plating the food so the plates, bowls and platters create a coherent look. Avoid having any commercial jars or packaging on the table. Plating everything will maintain the elegance of the table. Consider a menu board or labels for the food items, especially if your theme is food related. For an English tea party theme, use dainty, old-fashioned floral stationary to make your signs. If the decorations are French country, choose a chalk board to list food items. Choose flowers or candles that are mildly scented. You always want the food to be the star of the olfactory parade!"

Don't forget to include some festive non-alcoholic options for the non-drinkers. Soda water mixed with cranberry juice or fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice look good and taste good. Drinks can also be tied into a theme. If you are having a Great Gatsby inspired party, serve prohibition-era cocktails."

Make a sign or banner that says her name or simply \u201cbride-to-be.\u201d Provide a tiara, flower crown, or traditional veil for her to wear while she is opening her gifts. Don\u2019t forget the practical items that gift opening can require: several pairs of scissors, a trash bag for discarded wrapping paper, and tissues. As hostess of the party, count on providing yourself with a notebook and pen so you can jot down who gave what so the bride can send out thank you notes later."

Avoid kitschy gifts that will likely be thrown away and add a personalized decorative touch to store-bought items. For a spa-themed party, send your guests home with a pouch of herb and flower scented bath salt, a scented votive candle, and/or a beautiful bar of fragrant soap. Consider creating mini-bouquets out of the party\u2019s floral arrangements. Purchase mini-vases and send each guest home with fresh flowers. If the shower was a brunch time event, send guests home with a selection of gourmet teas and coffees."
