  "text":" Prepare the Dough Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Place the butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar in a large mixing bowl.  Using a handheld mixer or a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugars on medium speed until the mixture is light and fluffy.  Add the vanilla and 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil and mix it for an additional 30 seconds.  Turn the mixer down to low speed and add the flour.  Add the second tablespoon of vegetable oil.  Add the water. If the dough is still dry and crumbly, then add an additional tablespoon of water until the dough is wet but not overly moist. Mix in the chocolate chips with a wooden spoon or a flat plastic spatula.  Roll and Freeze the Dough Place a thin layer of cornstarch in a shallow bowl.  Scoop the dough out with a cookie scoop or tablespoon.  Using clean hands, roll the dough into balls that are equivalent in size to a ping-pong ball.  Roll the dough in cornstarch and place the dough onto the baking sheet. You can place the balls of dough close together on the baking sheet as long as they don\u2019t come into contact. Cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap and place the baking sheet in the freezer for 30 to 40 minutes.  Deep Fry the Cookie Dough Heat 2 cups of vegetable or canola oil in a Dutch oven until the oil is 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).  Combine the egg and water in a medium bowl using a fork.  Mix the flour and sugar in a separate bowl using a whisk.  Pour the flour and sugar mixture into the egg and water mixture and whisk it until all of the ingredients for the batter are well combined.  Remove the balls of dough from the freezer.  Roll each ball of dough in the batter until it is completely covered. If you leave any uncovered places, then the dough may ooze out. Use a mesh sieve to lower the balls of dough into the hot oil. Make sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry for 3 to 4 minutes or until the batter turns golden brown.  Remove the fried cookie dough from the hot oil with the sieve and place it onto a plate that is covered in paper towels.  Dust the fried cookie dough with confectioner\u2019s sugar.
