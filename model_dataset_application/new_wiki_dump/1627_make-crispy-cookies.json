If you put your dough into an oven that is not warm enough, your cookies will likely melt together into a giant cookie mess. For a thicker, yet still crispy, cookie, preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius)."

Because they will melt a lot when they cook, try to keep at least four inches between each cookie. If you want more evenly distributed and uniform cookies, use an ice cream scoop. Using parchment paper will make sure that the cookies do not stick. It also helps your baking sheets last longer.
