It can be used instead of molasses as an even more mildly flavored sweetener. Use the same amount of sorghum syrup to sub for molasses, but reduce the amount of sugar the recipe calls for, as sorghum is sweeter than molasses. Sorghum syrup is also rich in potassium, protein, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus."
