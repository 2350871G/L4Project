The diameter of the tube should be fairly small, so roll it tight. The diameter shouldn\u2019t be more than about 1/2\u201d to 3/4\u201d."

          "description":"Since the paper design doesn\u2019t have the weight and heft to rotate end over end very well when you throw it, you can flatten the handle to help make the shape a bit more aerodynamic. Simply set the tube down flat on your work surface, squish it down, and crease the flattened shape."

This last fold will be a bit more difficult to make since the paper will have gotten pretty thick. By making the head of the tomahawk dense like this, it will have more heft to rotate when you throw it. The final product will be roughly 2.75\u201dx4.25\u201d.

If you chose not to cut out a design and you\u2019re still using the full rectangular head, then it\u2019s important to make sure about 80% of the head is off to one side of the handle.
