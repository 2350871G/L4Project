Fortunately, vermiculite is relatively cheap; you'll be able to purchase a 2.2 pounds (1.00 kg)bag for under $10. Medium grade vermiculite is the standard choice for gardening. Check a gardening outlet or nursery for vermiculite. Looking up stores online will give you an idea of a store's stock without having to physically visit it."

Vermiculite will help maximize the moisture your container receives if it needs an extra push. Although you should still regularly water a gardening container manually, vermiculite is good if your climate is hot and doesn't get much rain on its own. Peat, perlite and manures are alternatives that may better suit your gardening situation."

Take 4 2 by 6 inches (5.1 by 15.2 cm) wooden boards and nail them together to create a 4 by 4 feet (1.2 by 1.2 m) box. This amount of space should be enough to grow the majority of container plants. Saw down the boards first to make sure they're smooth-edged and are the same width and length before you nail them together. Two nails (on near the top and one near the bottom) should be enough to firmly secure one board to another."

Open up your vermiculite bag and drain the contents into the soil you have prepared for the container. When this is finished, you can add the soil mix to the container. It helps to measure out the soil into your container beforehand. That way, you can add vermiculite until it reaches the 20-25% goal. You can add vermiculite with soil or peat moss, which is another well-known soil amendment."

You may add vermiculite to the soil before adding it to the container. This way, you can mix it together without worrying about damaging the plants. If you've properly measured out how much soil needs to go into the container, having that amount in a bag and adding the vermiculite to the bag will allow you to shake it up, thereby distributing it without having to proportion it out yourself."

If you're transferring a plant, lift it out gently from its original pot and place it in the desired spot in the container. If you're seeding the container from scratch, add seeds to the recommended depth on the seed packet. Be careful not to damage the roots of your plant if you transfer them into the container. Dig a small hole for it beforehand, and gently place it in. It may be helpful to place some fresh vermiculite around the plant to account for the dry soil the new plant brought in with it."
