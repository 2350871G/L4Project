This added moisture will turn your crispy meringue into a soft and sticky mess. An airtight container will help shield your meringue from moisture in the air. If possible, try to make pavlova on a dry day with low humidity to reduce the risk of moisture in the air softening your meringue. Avoid cooking other dishes or boiling water while you\u2019re baking and cooling your pavlova. Doing so can add moisture to the air in your kitchen."
