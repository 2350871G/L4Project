People tend to congregate and linger around the food tables at events, so make an effort to step away and keep your back to the table. This way you won't be staring at the food all night, thinking about what you can't eat and maybe talking yourself into having something you shouldn't eat.If it's a sit down dinner, try to excuse yourself before dessert is served to avoid temptation, and instead move around to chat with people at other tables. Or, if this is not an option, simply say you do not wish to be served dessert."

You will not have room for indulgent items that will sabotage your diet. Downsizing your plate has a psychological effect. If you eat off of a smaller plate, you feel like you're eating a lot. This helps you feel full and satisfied quicker."

You will follow your body's cues better and notice when you feel full. Then you can stop eating when you've had enough food, rather than mindlessly snacking. Be sure to chew your food slowly as well and sip water in between bites. Some people find setting utensils down between bites helps slow their eating."

Eat regular meals throughout the day so you don't go to the party starved. It may be helpful to eat a little before the party to ensure you won't be hungry. If you are strictly counting calories, reduce the portion size of regular meals instead of skipping meals altogether."
