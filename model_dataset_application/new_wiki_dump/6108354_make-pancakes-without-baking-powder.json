Hold the cracked egg over one of the bowls and open up the egg, keeping the yolk contained in one of the open halves. Carefully pour the yolk back and forth between the halves of the shell and allow the whites to drain into the bowl. After all of the whites are sitting in one bowl, pour your yolk into the empty bowl. Bring your eggs to room temperature by sitting them on the counter for around 1 hour. If you don't have time to bring them to room temperature, place them in a bowl of warm water for 2-5 minutes."

Continue to beat the mixture and slowly add in 1 tbsp (13 grams) of sugar and 0.75  fl oz (22 mL) of melted butter. Beat until the mixture holds almost stiff peaks. If the batter forms a peak on the end of the whisk when you dip in the whisk, remove it and turn it upside down; then your batter is ready. It should look like a small mountain peak. The mixture should be thick and heavy. If you do not have a thick mixture, continue beating it on medium speed until it thickens. To melt the butter, place it in a microwave-safe dish and microwave it for 10 seconds at a time, until all of the butter is melted."

Use a rubber spatula to stir the egg whites in completely. To fold the egg whites into the batter, use your spatula to scoop the batter, beginning at the bottom of the bowl, over the egg whites. It should replicate a folding motion. It may take a little while for you to mix the batter and egg whites using this method. However, do not stir your batter. Continue to use the scoop-and-fold method until the batter is completely mixed. If you stir the batter you will deflate it, resulting in flat pancakes. There should be no white streaks visible in the batter."
