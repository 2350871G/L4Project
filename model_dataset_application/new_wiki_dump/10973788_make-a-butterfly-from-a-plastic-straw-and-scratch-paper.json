  "text":" Making the Straw Torso Flatten the top of the straw, above the flexible part.  Cut the straw vertically from the end through the first two ridges on the flexible portion.  Hold the straw firmly so that it does not shift. Cut the two antennae. The side with the antenna is the back of the torso. Draw a curve, cut it, and stop 1 cm before the flexible part.  Cut the abdomen. Draw a curve from the back to the chest and cut it. Stop just before the end of the flexible portion. Curve and cut the corner of the end without the antenna. This is the only part of the straw you\u2019ll throw away. Make a diagonal cut on the belly side, slightly above the flexible portion. It is V-shaped when opened. Cutting Out the Paper Wings Fold a small piece of paper, like a Post-It note, in half.  Draw and cut out the shape of the wing so that the fold is along the butterfly\u2019s back.  Open it up. The symmetrical butterfly wing should be completed. Assembling the Butterfly Open the straight part of the cut straw. Insert the wing-shaped scratch paper into the torso. The side with antennae is the back. Insert the end of the V-cut ventral slip over the paper into the dorsal (marked by the flexible part).  Bend the belly while keeping the antennae straight. Insert it into the V-shaped notch, and adjust the length of the body. Adjust the angle of flapping of the wing itself.  Make more and decorate them. You can make colorful butterflies by coloring or adding stickers on the wings. Add googly eyes to make a butterfly with character. You can use shampoo or liquid detergent containers for the wings, too; they are water-resistant and robust because they are plastic. Use these butterflies to decorate a garden planter.
