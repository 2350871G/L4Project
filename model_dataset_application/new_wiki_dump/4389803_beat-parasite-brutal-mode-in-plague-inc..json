You can refer to the guide below for your Genetic setup, but you can choose whatever you see is effective for this level. Under the DNA Genes, choose \u201cCytochrome Surge.\u201d This will give you more DNA points whenever you pop an orange DNA. For the Travel Gene, Teracyte is advisable since it increases the chance of your plague to spread by land. It can cross borders as long as there's enough host. The Evolution Gene should be Sympto-Stasis; this will make the plague easier to cure but the symptoms in the later part of the game doesn't increase it's DNA points requirement. This is a very important part of the strategy. You don't have to worry about the Cure percentage in this stage since we will be using the 'undetected' approach until we have spread the plague in every part of world. Choose Genetic Mimic for your Mutation Gene. This will make the Parasite harder to cure, a good choice to counterbalance the Sympto-Statsis' drawback. Lastly, Extremophile is the best option for your Environment Gene. This will give minor bonus in all environments, giving your Parasite a faint boost to enter nations with different types of climate."

If you choose India, the very first country that will be infected is most likely China. From there, the plague will spread faster and effectively since there are already a good number of host from India.

Anaemia is a decrease in red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood which can lead to hypoxia in the organs. This, too, increases the infectivity. Generally, evolving Symptoms at the earliest part will make humans aware of the plague, causing them to do research for the cure before you could even infect the whole world, but with the Parasite's ability, Symbiosis, level 1 and level 2 symptoms are less likely noticed."
