          "description":"Coins that are made from silver or gold are best, as coins made from nickel and copper will leave stains on your finger. When you are first starting out with making coin rings, you should practice with smaller coins, such as nickels, dimes, or pennies. This is just to get the hang of the process. Quarters are a highly recommended coin because of their larger size. Look for quarters made prior to 1965, because until that point, quarters were made with 90% silver. Half-dollar coins are also a good option, again because of their size. It is still best to look for half-dollar coins made prior to 1965 due to their high silver makeup. Half-dollars are especially recommended for people with large ring sizes."

Do not touch the coin with your bare hands until it cools. Wear your protective gloves and goggles while you use the blow torch. Slide the coin onto the mandrel. You will use the mandrel to hammer the sides of the coin down, so it will only slide so far onto the mandrel for now. Set the tip of the mandrel on a piece of scrap wood to hold it in place. This reduces the risk of the mandrel moving around or jumping while you hit it. Hammer down the sides of the coin around the mandrel. Turn the mandrel periodically so that you hit all sides of the coin, flattening it against the mandrel. The ring will be slightly warped from this, as the mandrel grows in size from one end to the other. Therefore, one side of the ring will be wider than the other. This will be fixed.

Make sure that the smaller side of the ring is down on the wood and the wider side it up. This will make it easier for you to shape that edge down to a normal ring shape. Apply heat periodically and hammer the wide edge down until you achieve the shape you want. The band will thicken as you hammer the wide edge down so that it is flat and the same size as the other side of the ring. This process will push the metal down, which will slightly alter the ring size. Wear the protective gloves and goggles as you heat the ring again. Polish the ring once it has reached the shape and size you desire. You can polish the ring with a soft cloth, or you can use a polishing compound and felt finishing tip on a rotary tool. If you use a rotary tool, secure the ring standing up in a vise. Apply the polishing compound to the available side of the ring and polish.
