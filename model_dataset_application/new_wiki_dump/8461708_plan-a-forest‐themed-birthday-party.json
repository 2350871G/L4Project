Choose a date near the birthday that you intend to celebrate. In addition to choosing the date, you\u2019ll also have to figure out what time you want to have the party. If you are planning a party for younger children, make sure that you pick a time that does not interfere with school or kids getting to bed on time. If it\u2019s a party for older people, make sure that the time falls after when most people work. In addition to considering people\u2019s time, you\u2019ll also have to think about lighting in your forest party and whether you have artificial lights that can keep things bright during the nighttime. Most people, especially those in school or that work, prefer to attend parties over the weekend. If close family and friends are attending the party, talk to them first to see what is the most convenient day for most people."

Look online for parks that allow you to rent an area for a time and see what the restrictions or costs are. See if any parks near you will rent out space for a private event. If you don\u2019t want to hold your party in an actual forest, think of friends who may have a wooded backyard filled with trees or you can hold the party in your own backyard. Some parks may offer free park space for picnics and events to those with a smaller guest list."

If it\u2019s a surprise party, think of the person\u2019s closest family and friends and invite them. If you are creating the guest list for your own party, think of people that you\u2019d want to share time with and people who would get along with each other. If you are difficulty thinking of who to invite, look on social media to get a refresher of the people you know."

Determine how much disposable money you have to spend on the party and keep a running tally of receipts as you purchase items for the party. Set separate budgets for food, decorations, and party favors, and don\u2019t go over them. If a product might make you go over budget, look for cheaper alternatives."

If you\u2019d rather create your own invitation, try to incorporate aspects of the forest such as woodland creatures, mountains, leaves, and trees. You can also send digital forest-themed invitations through email or social media."

Sign examples include \u201cbear poop\u201d for bonbons, \u201cwoodland berries\u201d for mixed fruit cups, and \u201ctwigs\u201d for pretzel sticks.

Other items you can have them find include fruits, berries, nuts, or special flowers. You can buy something at the store to serve as the prize for the scavenger hunt.

Other games, like the bean bag toss, can be converted by swapping what you would normally use for the scoring hole, with an image of a woodland creature's mouth.
