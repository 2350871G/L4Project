Once your pet bird arrives in its temporary residence, you can remove the cover from the bird cage. If some areas of your house are free of fleas, you could remove your pet bird to the untreated area. For instance, if you have fleas downstairs but not upstairs, you might remove the pet bird to the upstairs area. If you choose to keep your pet bird in an unaffected room in the residence, keep the window open, door closed, and central air and heat off. However, it is always safest to remove your bird completely from the house, due to possible exposure to fumes. Keep your pet birds out of the residence until the flea spray is completely dry. Open your windows so the spray ventilates completely. Typically, you and your family \u2013 including your pet birds \u2013 will need to be out of the house for about three hours until the spray settles and dissipates."
