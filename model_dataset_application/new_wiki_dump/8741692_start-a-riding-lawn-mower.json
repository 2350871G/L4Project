Place a pan under the mower and open the drain valve, then replace the oil filter, if your mower has one, before adding fresh oil. To replace the filter, twist it clockwise.

Gently turn the metal plug to the right when putting it back on, tightening it with a wrench. If the plug is rusty or corroded, replace it. You can get spark plugs cheaply at a hardware store.

Replace it with the new solenoid, placing the wire harness over it, placing the wires on the solenoid\u2019s electrical connectors, then using the wrench to reconnect the bolts and main wires.
