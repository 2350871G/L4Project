You can try flours like buckwheat, coconut flour, soy flour, potato flour, cornstarch, or almond flour.

However, some cereals (look for gluten-free!) and soy products are fortified with it, so check labels to see if you are getting it in your diet. You can also try nutritional yeast, nori, or shitake mushrooms, which provide some vitamin B12. You may need to take a supplement of 10 micrograms a day or get B12 shots. Talk to your doctor about whether you are getting enough of this vitamin from your diet."

Some milk alternatives are fortified with this vitamin, for instance, as is some tofu. Mushrooms also contain small amounts of vitamin D, especially if you leave them in the sun for 15-25 seconds or so before consuming them. If you're not getting it from your diet, talk to your doctor about adding a vitamin D2 supplement to your diet. The vitamin D2 you get from mushrooms and plants can be converted into beneficial vitamin D3 by the sun."

When you eat meat, you get all the amino acids from 1 source. You can still get all those amino acids from a vegan diet, but you need to include a variety of protein sources to do it.

It can be easier to substitute a veggie for pasta than trying to find a gluten-free pasta, for instance. You could try spaghetti squash or zucchini noodles instead of always looking for a gluten-free substitute. You can also try smoothies, where you mix greens in with fruits, a nut butter, and alternative milk source. Make veggies the star of your meal. For instance, instead of a chicken curry, make a cauliflower curry with chickpeas, tomato sauce, coconut milk, and onions.
