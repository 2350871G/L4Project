If you are unsure whether your filter is dirty, hold it up to the light, and look through it. If you cannot see the light, the filter is dirty and needs to be replaced. A dirty filter will circulate dirt and dust through your home instead of usable, clean air and will force your furnace to work harder to push air through the grime. If your filter is not disposable, it must be cleaned. First remove any dirt or loose particles. Generally, a mild soap and tap water can then be used to rinse and wash the filter. Make sure to let the filter dry thoroughly before putting it back in the furnace. Many furnaces use a disposable filter. If this applies to yours, take the old filter to a hardware or appliance store (or record the size and/or model number), and purchase a replacement filter of the same type or model."
