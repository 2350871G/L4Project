          "description":"An unused side yard can easily fall into disarray. Before making any changes, you will need to clean up the space. Clean up and throw away any trash and unused objects. If you have grass, mow it to make it even and tidy. Pull up any weeds that you see. You will want to start with a clean and empty space. Try to make room by getting rid of or moving any old furniture or toys that are taking up space."

          "headline":"Choose a space for gardening.",
          "description":"Locate an open space for gardening. For a narrow space, up against the house is ideal. If you have a wider space, you can plant in multiple locations around the yard. If necessary, take measurements or section off the space you will use for the garden. Test  the soil in the space you choose for gardening to see what kind of plants would thrive there. Consider how much sunlight the area gets as well. If your plants require full sun, then the area will need to get at least 6 hours of sunlight every day."

        {
          "headline":"Amend the soil if needed.",
          "description":"If the soil is not ideal for planting, then you will need to add to it. Add 3 inches (7.6 cm) to 6 inches (15 cm) of compost to the soil and mix it into the top layer. You will need to amend the soil\u2019s pH level depending on what you want to plant. However, keep in mind that it will be easier to plant plants that will thrive in your soil\u2019s current pH rather than trying to amend the soil\u2019s pH."

          "description":"If you have a fence, it is also an option to plant climbing plants, like cucumbers, ivy, Morning Glory, golden hops, and St. Vincent Lilac. To prepare and plant climbing plants, you need to attach wire supports on the fence. Then, you should dig a hole about eighteen inches away from the plant. The hole should be twice as wide as the plant pot and slightly deeper. Digging a hole too close to the fence is not advised because the soil is usually dry in that area."

          "description":"Depending on the amount of space you have, you may want to limit the amount of flowers you plant. Consider flowers that are colorful and aesthetically pleasing. It is good to purchase flowers that will bloom at different times of the year so that there is always a touch of color in your yard. You can start with seeds, or choose flowers that just need to be planted into the ground. For instantly sprucing up a space, purchase some seedlings potted plants/flowers from a local nursery. Some perennial flower options are catmint, coneflower, coreopsis, and gaura."

You should also consider the amount of space you have and the time you are willing to put into the tending to the vegetables. If you\u2019re a beginner, some vegetables that are easy to grow are snap peas, carrots, and radishes. Cilantro, parsley, and thyme are a few herbs that are easy to grow. Consider how much time you will be able to invest before planting vegetables."

Flower boxes can be purchased at your local nursery or home improvement store. For a sunny window, bright flowers like Dusty Miller and Verbena are ideal. Plants with colorful leaves, like Dark Star and Dappled Apple, are best for shady windows. Succulents are great to plant if you won\u2019t have much time to tend to the boxes. To plant the flowers, put potting mix and fertilizer into the box and place the flowers into the soil. Think of flowers that would complement the flowers in your garden."

Surrounding the garden with wood can also be done purely for looks. All you need to do is purchase planks of wood, set them up around the garden, and attach them with a hammer and nails."

You can buy some larger pots, small pots to put on tables, and if you have a place to hang them, you can buy hanging pots. Look for perennial flowers, like coneflower, that will stay lovely and colorful all year long. Instead of flowers, you can also choose plants or herbs for the pots. Heuchera and ferns are plants that grow well in containers. For herbs, lemon thyme and \u2018Alaska\u2019 nasturtium is well-suited for pots. Buy potting soil and fertilizer, then plant the flowers into the pots."

The table and chairs directly on the ground, but for more stability, it is better to place them on a wooden deck or stones. You can purchase a wooden or pop up gazebo to place over the table for coverage during light rain or bright sun. Gazebos can be purchased from home improvement stores.
