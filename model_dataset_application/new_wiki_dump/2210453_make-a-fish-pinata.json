  "text":" Remove one of the long flaps from the cardboard box. Bend the edges of the flap until it forms a three-dimensional half circle. Pour the glue into the container. You'll be dipping the paintbrush into this container. Cover the surface of the cardboard semi-circle with glue. Stick the newspaper strips or bits over the glue and onto the cardboard. It's okay to glue over the edges. Flip the cardboard semi-circle over. Add newspaper to this side too. Keep the cardboard bent in shape. Remove a second flap from the box. Use the flap which has the exact same length as the first flap removed. Again, bend it until it forms a three dimensional semi-circle shape. Cover it with glue and newspaper as with the first flap. Keep the cardboard bent in shape. Now fix the the shorter flaps. Remove these from the box. Then, cover the other two shorter flaps in glue and newspaper on, both sides. Make three more cardboard pieces that are covered in newspaper. Use the flaps on the other side of the box this time. Cover in newspaper and glue as before. Cut each covered long piece of cardboard into an oval shape.  Take one piece of cardboard. Pick one side on the front or back of the oval. Bend it wither left or right, but do not break it off. Do this to both sides on each piece of cardboard. Glue each bent piece to the other bent piece of the other piece of cardboard. Push together until they dry and stick together.
