Search for certified arborists or tree specialists in your area. Remember that certification doesn't always mean that they will do the best work, just that they have demonstrated their knowledge of tree removal. Contact multiple businesses and ask them to evaluate the job and provide you with a price quote. Be wary of professionals who are willing to quote you a price over the phone. Ask for proof of their insurance and certifications, and check their references who have had similar work completed."
