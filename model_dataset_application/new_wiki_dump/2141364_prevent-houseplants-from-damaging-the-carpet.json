Wide, shallow pots are less prone to tipping than taller, more narrow pots, and are preferred when attempting to minimize carpet damage. If one pot is more likely to be knocked than others because of where it is, making sure the pot is nice and stable should be a priority."

          "description":"If a clay pot is overturned, it is very likely to break and spill all of its soil onto your carpet (along with the broken shards of the pot). Using pots made from plastic, bamboo, or other unbreakable materials will help keep carpet damage to a minimum if pots are tipped over. In some situations, a clay pot is more appropriate. Clay pots are more porous and drain better than plastic pots, so if your plant is something like a cactus, which requires well-drained soil, a clay pot might be a better option."

Air plants can be grown in nothing at all, while plants like lucky bamboo can be grown in water alone. Some cacti and succulents can be grown in gravel alone, which is much easier to remove from carpet than soil. Using multi-colored glass as a base also gives you more flexibility to get creative with the colors that you put on display."
