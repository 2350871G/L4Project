The mainline is the portion of rope or string that\u2019s on the other side of your spool or object. Cross the free end of the string (the end with the knot) over the mainline, then bring it under the mainline so that it forms a loop around it. Hold the loop with your fingers.

Take the end of the string and cross it over your free line again with the loop still intact. Pull the end of the string behind and through the loop. Thread the tag end of the line through the loop to make a slip knot. Pull on the free end of the string to tighten the knot. This will create a slipknot that can slide down your string or rope. Pull on both strings to tighten the knot. Pulling on the strings will tighten the slipknot around whatever you\u2019re tying the knot to and position both knots right next to each other. Trim the excess free line. Use a pair of scissors or a razor blade to cut the excess string on the free line.
