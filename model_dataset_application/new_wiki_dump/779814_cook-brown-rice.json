Add to saucepan. For softer rice, soak the grains in cold water for 45 minutes to an hour before cooking. This allows the water to penetrate the outer bran layers. Optionally, you can heat a little oil in the saucepan over medium heat and fry the rice for a moment before adding the water. This helps build flavor, but is definitely optional."
