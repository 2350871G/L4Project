          "description":"Many factory car alarms are designed to turn off when in proximity to the appropriate key or key fob. You may be able to shut your car alarm down simply by inserting your key into the lock on the driver\u2019s side door, locking it, and unlocking it again. Because the car is being unlocked by the appropriate key, it may send a signal to the alarm that it can shut down. While the passenger side door may work, it is more likely it will work on the driver\u2019s side. If the door is already locked, simply unlock it. If the alarm doesn\u2019t stop, try locking it an unlocking it again."

          "description":"Using a similar methodology to the key method, unlocking the vehicle\u2019s doors with the key fob will also shut down many factory car alarms. When standing close enough to the vehicle for your key fob to reach, press the lock button followed by the unlock button. Many car alarms will shut down when the car doors are unlocked by the keys or appropriate key fob. If the door locks do not respond, the batteries may be dead in the key fob. Replace the batteries and try again. If the doors unlock and the alarm continues to go off, there may be a specific way to turn off the alarm for the aftermarket model you may have. If it has a \"switch\" turn it to the \"on\" position. Hold the black button down and press the gas pedal at the same time while the key turned to the on position in the ignition. Hold until you hear fast beeps indicating the alarm has been reset."

          "description":"Most key fobs have an orange or yellow button on them commonly referred to as a \u201cpanic button.\u201d  This button activates something very similar to a car alarm. The horn will honk and the lights will flash. If you accidentally hit the panic button, it may continue until you press the button again. In some cars, you may be able to shut down the panic mode by starting the car and driving it. Most panic alarms will shut off on their own after a certain amount of time. The panic alarm may not shut off when you start the car, but will if you begin to drive."

Unlock the door and enter your vehicle. Insert the key and turn it to \u201cACC\u201d (accessories). If the alarm persists, attempt to start the car. Remember that some aftermarket alarms may not allow you to start the car with the alarm sounding, even with the key.

If you are unable to shut the alarm off with your keys or key fob, check the owner\u2019s manual for instructions on what to do. Every auto maker uses different car alarms, so some may require a specific action be taken before the alarm will shut down. You may need to repeat an action a certain number of times to reset the computer, such as locking and unlocking the door."

Use the vehicle\u2019s owner\u2019s manual to identify the box with the fuse powering your factory car alarm. The fuse box may be located in the engine bay or the cabin of the car. If it is located in the cabin, you may need to remove some trim pieces to be able to access it. Be careful when removing plastic trim pieces of your interior, as they may be brittle and prone to breaking. Place trim pieces off to the side to ensure you don\u2019t step or sit on them as you work."

Identify the fuse in the diagram that powers the car alarm, then locate its corresponding fuse in your vehicle. If you do not have a diagram on the cover or in the manual, you will need to utilize the \u201cguess and check\u201d method of locating the fuse for the alarm in the next step.

The alarm should power down immediately with the fuse removed. If you were unable to identify which was the correct fuse using a diagram, remove and replace fuses one at a time until you remove the one that makes the alarm stop.

The alarm should be reset and should not turn back on once the fuse has been reinserted into the fuse box. If the alarm reactivates as you slide the fuse back into place, it means the alarm is not functioning properly. If the alarm comes back on, you will likely need to take the vehicle to be repaired by a professional. If the alarm comes back on a few minutes after you reinsert the fuse, something must be setting it off, such as a faulty key fob or an issue with the electronic control unit of the vehicle."

When a battery is in the trunk of a vehicle, it is often under a carpeted piece of wood separating it from the trunk compartment and may be located alongside your spare tire. If you are having difficult locating your battery, refer to your owner\u2019s manual to help you find it.
