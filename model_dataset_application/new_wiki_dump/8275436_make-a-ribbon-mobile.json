If you\u2019re hanging it over a small changing table in a nursery, you will probably want a smaller hoop. It\u2019s important to think about the space and the purpose of your ribbon mobile before you select the hoop you\u2019ll use.

Just remember, always double the ribbon over before cutting, so each strand is twice as long. You can purchase a variety of ribbons from your local craft store.

A hitch knot allows you to attach the ribbons to the hoop without any unsightly knots. Fortunately, these knots are pretty easy to master. Fold your ribbon in half, so that you have two strands of ribbon. Place the fold of the ribbon where you want it on the mobile, on the inside of the hoop. In other words, there should be little ribbon loop where you want the ribbons to be tied. Pull the fold, or loop, of the ribbon over the hoop. Grab the two strands of ribbons and pull it through the loop of the ribbon, which is wrapped over the hoop. Pull both ends equally to secure your hitch knot on the hoop."
