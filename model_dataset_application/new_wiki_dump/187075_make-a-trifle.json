          "description":"A trifle doesn't need to be cooked and requires little hard-core cooking skill to put together. It can be made well in advance and is particularly adaptable if you feel like new flavors. When considering your trifle, know that you have some options:\n\nFruit: As long as it is bite-sized, anything goes. In general, softer, sweeter fruits that pack a lot of juice do best. Custard: Pick a custard or pudding flavor that matches your fruit, or use a vanilla-flavored custard that will go with just about anything. Jelly or jam: Again, pick something to complement your fruits, but know that jelly isn't the only option. Adventurous cooks might use some honey, or even a chocolate spread like Nutella."

That said, a \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) thick white cake makes an excellent substitute, so long as it is chopped up to easily placed pieces. Angel food cake and pound cake also make wonderful substitutes, so long as you cut them with a serrated knife to roughly \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) thickness."

The usual choice is a cream sherry, which will go well with just about any filling or fruit, but you can mix it up depending on your toppings.
