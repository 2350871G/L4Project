      "description":"The detergent aspect of the shampoo is important because it changes the nature of the oily substance that is causing the odor. The very warm water makes it easier to wash and rinse your pet because their body temperature is higher than yours and they are always wearing their coat. When you wet their coat it looses all of its insulation ability and if the water is too cool, your pet gets cold. If your shower is big enough for you and your pet, and you have a hand sprayer, using the shower and hand sprayer works really well."

It is normally not necessary to wash down inside their ears, but if their ears stand up naturally, it may be necessary, just use a minimal amount of water and let them shake it out right away."
