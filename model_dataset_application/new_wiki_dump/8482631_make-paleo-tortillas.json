Allow the tortillas to cool for 5-10 minutes before you serve them. You can refrigerate your tortillas for up to 3 to 4 days or you can freeze them. Making Grain-Free Tortillas Mix cassava flour, flax meal, and salt together. Sift the ingredients together with a fine mesh sieve. If you don't have a sieve, you can use a bowl and your hands to thoroughly mix the dry ingredients together. Combine the melted coconut oil and water with the dry ingredients. Use a whisk or a fork to incorporate the coconut oil and water in a separate bowl before pouring it in your cassava and flax mixture. Continue to mix everything together until it starts to form a dough. Knead and roll the dough into two inch (5.08 cm) balls. Knead the dough on a cutting board until it is smooth.
