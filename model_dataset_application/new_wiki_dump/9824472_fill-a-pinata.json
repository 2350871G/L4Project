The candies should be individually wrapped so that they won\u2019t get dirty when they fall to the ground. If you live in a warm climate, or your party will be during the summer, some candies could melt. Avoid candy that melts easily (such as chocolate or taffy) and go for pixie sticks, lollipops, or gummies instead. Store your pinata in a cool, dry place before the party."

Finger puppets, jumping frogs, plastic animals, bouncy balls are all great kids\u2019 toys to put in a pinata. Toys are also a good alternative if you're worried that candy is too unhealthy."
