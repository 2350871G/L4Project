  "text":" Marinating the Pork Cut the pork belly into strips. Take out 2 pounds (910 g) of pork belly and use a sharp knife to slice it into 1/2 in to 1 in (1.3 to 2.5 cm) strips. Place the pork into an airtight container. If you don't have pork belly, you can use pork loin or shoulder. Pour fish sauce over the pork and chill it for 1 hour. Toss the pork with 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of fish sauce in the airtight container. Then cover the container and put it in the refrigerator. Marinate the pork for 1 hour. Marinating the pork will intensify the flavor of the dinuguan. Clean and boil \u20442 pound (230 g) of pork intestines (optional). Thoroughly rub and rinse the intestines under running water. Then place them in a large pot and pour enough water to cover the intestines. Bring the water to boil over high heat and add 1 1/2 in (3.8 cm) of the fresh ginger root. Boil the intestines for 45 minutes. The intestines should become soft. Let them cool before you slice and add them to the dinuguan. Ensure that you sanitize your work space after handling the intestines because they contain bacteria that can cause disease. Cooking the Pork with Aromatics Combine the pig's blood and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of the vinegar. Pour 1 \u20442 cups (350 ml) of pig's blood into a bowl and stir in 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of the vinegar until it's incorporated. Set the blood mixture aside. If the blood is coagulated, put it in the blender and pulse the blood until it liquefies. Saut\u00e9 the onion, garlic, and ginger for about 5 minutes. Heat 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. When the oil shimmers, stir in 1 chopped onion, 4 cloves of minced garlic, and 1 teaspoon (2 g) of grated fresh ginger. Stir the aromatics occasionally until they soften and become fragrant. Add the pork and cook it for 3 to 5 minutes. Keep the burner at medium heat and stir in the marinated pork strips.

Pour 1 cup (240 ml) of vinegar into the pot and turn the burner to medium-high. Bring the vinegar to a boil and then continue to boil the mixture with the lid off. Avoid stirring the dinuguan while it boils. About half of the vinegar should evaporate as it boils. Simmering and Serving the Dinuguan Add the water and simmer the dinuguan for 15 to 20 minutes. Pour 1 cup (240 ml) of water into the pot and bring the mixture to a boil. Turn the burner down to medium or medium-low so it bubbles gently. Put the lid on the pot and simmer the dinuguan until the pork is tender enough to cut with a fork. Stir in the pig's blood mixture and sugar. Add the reserved pig's blood and vinegar mixture along with 1 tablespoon (12.5 g) of brown sugar. Stir until the pig's blood and sugar have dissolved. Keep stirring until you don't see lumps of blood or sugar. Add 2 Anaheim peppers and season the dinuguan to taste. Stir in the whole peppers and taste the dinuguan. Add salt and pepper according to your taste. Simmer the dinuguan for 10 minutes before serving. Let the dinuguan bubble gently over medium heat with the lid off. The sauce should thicken as it cooks. Then turn off the burner and serve the dinuguan with rice or puto (steamed rice cakes). Store the leftover dinuguan in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.",
