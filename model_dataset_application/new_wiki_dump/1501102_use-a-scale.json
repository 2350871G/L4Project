          "description":"Most kitchen scales for home use are digital as they are more accurate and easier to use than analog scales. Look for a scale that can switch between measuring units. To give you the most flexibility when preparing food, a good scale should be able to weigh in grams, kilograms, ounces, and pounds. Also look for a scale with a \u201ctare\u201d function that zeroes out the weight of measuring containers. Most scales for home use have a capacity between 10 and 12 pounds. Unless you bake in large batches, you probably don\u2019t need a scale that measures beyond that."

          "headline":"Place a bowl or plate on the scale and zero out its weight.",
          "description":"You should always use the tare/zero function to zero out the weight of the container before you add the food to be measured. Use the appropriate type of plate or bowl. You might want to use a bowl when using ingredients that will need to be combined, such as when you\u2019re baking, and use a plate when weighing things like meat. You can also weigh foods directly on the scale. Always wipe off and clean your scale with a hot soapy paper towel before and after weighing, especially if you use it to weigh something like raw meat or poultry. Zero out the scale after if using multiple ingredients. For example, if you\u2019re baking a cake, add the baking powder, then press the \u201czero\u201d or \u201ctare\u201d button to reset the scale to zero before adding the flour or other ingredients."

          "description":"Scales are great for a variety of reasons. Make sure you use your scale correctly and read the directions before use. Liquid ingredients can be measured accurately using a volumetric method (like a measuring cup), but dry ingredients should always be weighed if you want the best control over your results. Control portion sizes with a scale. You can weigh just about any type of food. Make sure to weigh \u201cdeceptive\u201d food items (foods that don\u2019t fit well into measuring cups) like dry pasta and breakfast cereal. In addition, stick to the following portion sizes for the food groups:  3-4 oz of protein , 1 oz of grains, 4 oz of fruit  or 8 oz of vegetables. Use a scale to divide portions equally. For example, if you\u2019re baking a layer cake, a scale can help you divide the batter evenly between three pans: just zero out the weight of the pan before adding the batter. If your recipe gives volumetric measurements for dry goods, find a reliable converter to help you determine what they weigh. You can purchase these or find them online."

          "description":"There are a variety of bathroom and home scales that you can purchase. Some will be relatively inexpensive, whereas others will cost a significant amount more. Choose a quality scale that still fits in with your budget. You want a scale that will last for several years and be able to maintain its calibration. In addition, digital scales are thought to be superior to mechanical scales as these are fragile and more inaccurate. Many quality digital scales are accurate within 1 pound anywhere between 97 \u2013 100% of the time. Older-model spring and dial scales may be accurate as little as 13% of the time. You may even want to consider a newer model digital scale that can measure body fat and even track weight loss."

Placing your scale on carpet can cause the scale to read your weight as 10% heavier! The bathroom or kitchen is usually a good place for an at-home scale. Make sure the scale is lying level.
