      "headline":"Look professional.",
      "description":"If you look professional, you have a better chance of getting the dream job you've always wanted. You need to make a good first impression. For boys, you can buy a suit from Kestrel, or Gucci (Virtual Stores). Girls can go to Kestrel as well, and shop for a nice dress. If you don't have robux just work with what you have, if the interviewer makes a comment on your outfit just tell them that you are short on robux. Outfits aren't everything, however. It is your kind manner, how professional your determination to succeed. A player that looks professional doesn't necessarily act in a professional manner or have amazing grammar. It's okay to use free clothes as long as you act extremely professionally, are sophisticated and nice to everyone. The MRs will spot you and you'll be more likely to pass the interview and maybe even get promoted."

    {
      "headline":"Show up on time.",
      "description":"The last thing you want to do is to show up late. Set a timer on your computer to remind you to join the server. Usually, the server will lock as soon as the interview starts. Get there around 10-15 minutes early. If you don't make it on time, don't worry, there will always be another interview. If you show up early then the MRs and HRs will think of you as an achiever and extremely organized."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Be grammatically correct.",
      "description":"Most places want you to use grammar, so use it correctly. Practice beforehand to lock it in your memory. Spelling is also very important. With grammar, make sure to type fast and read what you are writing to double check that there are no errors or mistakes. Big groups such as Hilton Hotels, Panda Express, Dunkin' Donuts, Frappe and Fizze (there are also many more groups) have a rule of 3 grammar strikes, if you exceed the limit then you are automatically disqualified from the interview session and you have to attend another."

      "headline":"Be polite.",
