Fewer trips to the grocery store will help you save money and fuel, as well as say no to the plastic bags and packages that have a tendency to pile up once you\u2019re there. Raising a selection of your own crops will also ensure that you always have fresh, healthy fruits and vegetables to eat. Make room for a patch of fresh herbs like rosemary, basil, and cilantro. You\u2019ll then have everything you need to put together a delicious meal."
