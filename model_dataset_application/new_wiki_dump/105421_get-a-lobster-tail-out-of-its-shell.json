Hold the tail section in one hand\nHold the body in the other hand\nBend the two sections toward each other, across the lobster's back. You can also separate the body from the tail in a twisting motion. Be bold! Place the body in the bowl. Lobster freaks may actually twist off the little legs and suck the meat out, but it's a labor of love."
