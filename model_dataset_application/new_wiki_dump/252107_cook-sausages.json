          "description":"Light a burner on the stove and set it to medium or medium-high heat. Set a sturdy pan or skillet over the heat. Let it sit for a minute or two to get hot. When the pan is ever-so-lightly smoking or a drop of water immediately starts sizzling when it touches it, you're ready to cook."

          "headline":"Add a little oil.",
          "description":"Sausages are fairly fatty, so you don't need to add a lot of extra fat to the pan. However, this fat will be trapped inside the casing at first, meaning there is a window of several minutes where the sausages can stick to the pan and burn. A 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of cooking oil (canola, etc.) spread around the pan can keep it slick until the fats inside the sausages make their way into the pan. Use caution with olive oil. It has a lower smoke point than many cooking, which means that it will start to smoke at lower temperatures. This isn't dangerous, but it can set off your smoke alarm and may have a minor effect on the taste of the sausages."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Lay the sausages on the hot surface.",
          "description":"Carefully put the sausages in the pan one-by-one. Leave enough space so that none of the sausages are touching. This helps them cook evenly on all sides. If you're cooking many sausages, this may mean that you need to cook them in batches. If the sausage casings are connected, cut them apart before putting them on the pan."

        {
          "headline":"Cook until brown on both sides.",
          "description":"Let the sausages cook without disturbing them at first. After about two minutes, flip them over. Continue turning the sausages every few minutes until they are brown on all sides. Depending on the size of the sausages, this should take between about 10 and 15 minutes. When the sausages are well-browned, cut into one at its mid point. The meat should by firm and cooked all the way through. There should be no pink remaining and any juices should run clear. If not, continue cooking. A long set of tongs can help protect your hands from sputtering grease."

          "description":"Waiting for sausages to cook all the way through can be frustrating. Luckily, there are a few ways to cut down on the time you need to spend in front of the stove:\nOne way is to butterfly the sausages. Take a sharp knife and slit the sausage down one side from end to end. Open the sausage up (like a \"butterfly\") and lay the exposed filling face down on the pan. Cook this way until well-browned. You can also flatten the sausages to spread them thinner so that they cook faster. To do this, press down on them with the bottom of a heavy pan or skillet before you start cooking them."
        },
        {
          "headline":"If needed, finish off by steaming.",
          "description":"Some sausages (especially large ones) take forever to cook all the way through. If you'd like to keep cooking your sausages but are worried about burning them, try using this technique. You'll need a lid that fits snugly over your pan. Cook the sausages as normal until well-browned but still raw on the inside. Pour a half cup of water into the hot pan. Cover the pan with a lid. The steam from the water will get trapped underneath and start heating the sausage from all sides. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cook for five to ten minutes, then carefully remove the lid so as to avoid steam burns. Cook the sausage for another few minutes to restore some of the \"crispness\" to the casings."

          "description":"Cooking sausages on a grill is similar to cooking them in a pan, but not exactly the same. To get started, light your grill and let it build up heat. If you're using a gas grill, set the burners to medium-high. If you're using charcoal, light a generous pile of briquettes and let them burn to the point that they are ashed-over and glowing orange. If you're using charcoal and are unsure how to get started, see our guide to lighting charcoal grills for detailed instructions."

          "description":"Once your grill is hot, it's time to make a minor adjustment. You want to leave one side of the grill hot but reduce the heat on the other side. This isn't hard \u2014 see below:\nIf you're using a gas grill, just turn down the burner(s) on one side to low. If you're using a charcoal grill, carefully use a metal grill tool to pull most of the hot coals to one side, leaving just a thin layer on the other side. Put the grill over the hot briquettes carefully."

        {
          "headline":"Sear the sausages on the hot side.",
          "description":"Now, lay the sausages on the hot side of the grill one-by-one. Take care that there is a little space on either side of each sausage so that they can cook evenly. As when pan-frying, if the sausage casings are connected, cut them apart before cooking them. Turn the sausages after two minutes. The underside should have a healthy dark-brown sear. Let the second side sear for about a minute before proceeding."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Transfer to the cold side to cook through.",
          "description":"Once the sausages are well-browned, use a long fork or a set of tongs to move them to the other side of the grill. Here, they'll continue to cook, but you won't risk burning them like you would on the hot side. Let them cook for about 10 more minutes, turning occasionally. As noted above, the sausages are done when they are well-browned on the outside and have meat that is firm all the way through with no pink. Juices should run clear."

You may instead want to try making a mixture of water and your favorite liquid cooking ingredients. For instance, broth, stock, wine, beer, and tomato sauce can all transfer their flavor to sausage as it cooks. Boiling sausages won't give them a crisp exterior, but it will preserver the moisture and fat content within them. This makes boiling a good choice for emulsified sausages \u2014 those filled with a smooth mixture of finely-ground meat, fat and water.

If they weren't pre-cooked, you may need to cook them for up to 30 minutes before taking them out. In either case, stir occasionally so the sausages cook all over. Boiled sausages look a little different than grilled or fried sausages when they're done. They won't have a brown exterior \u2014 instead, they'll simply be firm and uniform all the way through, with no remaining pink.

Get a frying pan or skillet hot, add a spoonful of oil, and fry the sausages on either side for a few minutes until browning occurs. Many sausages from Central or Eastern Europe are traditionally eaten boiled. However, they still taste good browned, so don't be afraid to cook them this way."
