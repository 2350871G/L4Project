Use a sweatshirt, scarf, or other material. If you have water available, make the fabric damp. Keep your face pointed down, and keep yourself close to the ground."

          "description":"Get as far away as possible from the fire. Ideally, get into a vehicle and drive away from the fire. If you are on foot, head for non-flammable terrain, such as a road or body of water. If the fire is very close, attempt to find shelter in a building, vehicle, body of water, or low area of ground (like a ditch). If you are in the midst of a blaze, do not run. Instead, submerge yourself in a body of water or lay in a low ditch. Wait for the blaze to pass, and then evacuate. Dampen your clothes and/or cover yourself with mud or soil to protect yourself from the heat."

Try not to worry about personal possessions. Almost anything can be replaced. When it is time to evacuate, be sure to:\nWear protective clothing, such as sturdy shoes, cotton/wool clothing, jeans, a long-sleeved shirt, gloves, and a scarf or handkerchief to protect your face. Make sure children and elderly people get to safety first. Evacuate any pets. Close all doors and windows. Turn off your gas. Open your fireplace damper, but close the screen. Grab your important papers."

This is accomplished by doing a controlled burn around the perimeter of a forest fire. A controlled burn will allow you to cut off the fuel source of the larger fire by already burning off the dry plants. A fireline removes the fuel component of the fire. This method is considered an indirect attack on the fire."

Other times fire may be brought in via tanker or helibucket. Firefighters often use water to create a fireline, soaking up the perimeter of the fire, and preventing future spreading."

          "headline":"Deploy suppressant foam.",
          "description":"Depressant foam is used as an alternative water, to create fire lines and/or suppress fire. Just like water, this foam can be applied from the ground or from the air. Whether you use an aerial or a ground application, suppressant foam can help you extinguish your fires faster by acting as an insulated barrier to keep unburned fuels from being ignited. The bubble structure of the foam also gives you a slower, more controlled water drainage, which helps you penetrate better and longer into the fuel sources."

          "description":"Areas like rivers, lakes, roads, swamps and rocky areas can be a natural ending spot for a fire so that you can concentrate on tackling other sides. All fire suppression activities are based from an anchor point, which is often one of these spots. The likelihood of the fire reaching this area is lower than average, so these area can act as base camps for firefighters."
