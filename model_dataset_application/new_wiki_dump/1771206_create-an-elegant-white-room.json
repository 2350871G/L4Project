Having accents in your room will create the needed contrast and focal points. Black is a nice, stark contrast, which would make an even more elegant room, but you can use any colour you like the most. Changing the Room to All White Paint the walls all white. If you have a dark room, you will need to layer many coats. Use long, even strokes in all one direction, and don't touch the paint while it's drying. Purchase a new bed or remodel your existing bed.

Put in a vanity desk. This should be white. Put ivory or cream coloured shelves above your bed. You can put your books, DVDs, and CDs on them. Adding Accessories Hang a chandelier in the middle of your room. This does not have to be antique, but crystal or \"fristal\" (fake crystal) would work very well. Place down a rug. Choose a deep pile one that you can sink your feet into it when you get up in the morning. Try a rug in your accent colour. Add a floor lamp. Have it in white. Place it beside your bed. Put curtains on your window. They should be simple black velvet curtains held up by an accent colour ribbon. Include other accessories relevant to your taste.
