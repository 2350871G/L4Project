          "description":"Making a cappuccino starts with making an espresso. Because you're going to be adding ice and watering down the beverage, it\u2019s a good idea to start with a double shot, which requires about 20 g of coffee. Transfer the measured coffee beans to a grinder and grind them to a fine grind. A fine grind means the coffee will be about the same size as table salt."

Place the portafilter back into the group head, and turn the handle to lock it in place. Place a cup below the portafilter. Turn on the water and let it run for 30 seconds. Turn off the water to stop extracting the shot. To make sure there's room for the milk later, pull the espresso into a 6- or 7-ounce (177- to 207- ml) cup."

          "description":"You can still make an espresso-type beverage without a proper machine, though you'll get the best results with a dedicated espresso maker. To make espresso at home without a machine, you can:\nUse a stovetop moka pot. Fill the lower water reservoir with the water, and place the metal basket inside the reservoir. Fill the metal basket with the coffee grinds, and then twist on the lid and upper reservoir. Heat the moka pot over medium heat until coffee fills the upper reservoir. Brew a strong pot of coffee. As a last resort, you can also brew coffee that\u2019s twice as strong in place of the espresso. So if you normally use two scoops of coffee to make a two-cup pot of coffee, use four scoops and brew a pot."

Turn on the steam and heat the milk to 149 F (65 C), until the milk has doubled in volume, or until the jug is very hot to the touch. Heat the milk in a saucepan on the stove to steam it without an espresso maker. Bring the milk to a simmer over medium heat, but don\u2019t let it boil. Simmer the milk for about five minutes, until it\u2019s hot and bubbly. A cappuccino is made up of equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and foam, so you'll froth twice as much milk as you have espresso."

Blending the Cappuccino with Ice Combine the ice cubes and cappuccino in a blender. Remove the chilled cappuccino from the refrigerator and pour it into the blender.

Transfer the iced cappuccino to a serving glass. When the blended iced cappuccino is ready, pour the mixture out of the blender and into a tall glass. Make sure to leave room for whipped cream and other garnishes if you so desire. Serving Your Iced Cappuccino Top it with whipped cream. Whipped cream is a popular and delicious way to finish any iced coffee beverage. After transferring your blended iced cappuccino to a tall serving glass, add a few dollops or a swirl of whipped cream to the top for an extra-sweet treat. You can use regular dairy-based whipped cream for your coffee, or non-dairy coconut whipped cream as well. Garnish it with chocolate or cocoa. Whether you add whipped cream to your iced cappuccino or not, you can still garnish the top with chocolate or cocoa powder. To add cocoa, sprinkle a pinch of powder evenly over the surface of the beverage. To add chocolate, use a vegetable peeler to shave a few curls of chocolate off a bar and onto the beverage. If you do garnish with whipped cream and chocolate, add the whipped cream first and the chocolate or cocoa on top. Add ground spices. You can also garnish your blended iced cappuccino with spices. Sprinkle a pinch (about \u215b teaspoon (0.3 g)) of your favorite ground spices on top of the beverage or the whipped cream right before serving.
