      "headline":"Choose what style of sword you are using.",
      "description":"A basic broadsword is great for blocking and thrusting, but slashes are harder with a heavier blade. Daggers are hard to use for beginners, as they require being very close to possibly more experienced enemies. If you want to try a new thing, use daggers. Scimitars are curved, lightweight, and great for slashing and thrusting. Since scimitars are thinner, it is usually best to avoid strikes rather than block them."

      "headline":"Learn the three kinds of blocks: Hard block, parry, and beat.",
      "description":"To do a hard block, put the forte of your blade in the path of the opponents strike. Hard blocks cannot thwart thrusts, however. To do a parry, use the middle of your sword to connect to your opponent's middle or foible. Maintaining this contact, maneuver your enemy's sword off of it's course. A beat is an exaggerated parry. To do a beat, you club your opponent's sword as hard as possible with your own when they try to strike. If you beat hard enough, you can disarm your enemy."

      "headline":"Now, you need to learn the basic strikes: Thrust, and slash.",
      "description":"To thrust, hold your sword level, and lunge forward. To slash, swing your sword over your head, or to one side. To fight with a two handed sword, you use many of the same techniques, but you have to calculate for slower strikes and blocks, as your sword is heavier."
