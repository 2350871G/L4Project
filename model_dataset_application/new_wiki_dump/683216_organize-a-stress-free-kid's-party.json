For a home party, make sure you have ample seating and room to move around. For a party place, visit the facility and take a tour. If your party is mostly kids, go for the kid play park. If the number of adults outweigh the kids, make sure you account for this in your choice of location. Don't be afraid to ask guests for ideas ahead of time."

      "description":"Keep it simple. Provide your child's favorite dish , order pizza for convenience and easy clean up. Throw in healthy foods like fruit and veggie plates. If you have favorite family recipes by all means, cook it up. It will be a nice gesture, but don't make this your focal point. Your focal point is your little one's big day and he or she will want your full attention."

To mark the special occasion, set up one structured activity that makes the day special. Pi\u00f1atas are always a hit, just proceed with caution around children and the bat. If you are having a home party, you may want to opt for a few more activities to keep the kids busy. Otherwise your house becomes \u201cThe \u201cPark\u201d and could suffer some serious damage. Keep the kids playing party games and your home will survive. If you really want to have a clown, face painting, a singer, or have \u201cDora\u201d show up check with the facility hosting your party. They should be able to get you a much better deal on added entertainment."

The park party may cost the least but require the most logistical preparation. Do you have more money or more time? Can you let someone else handle the details, or do you prefer being included in all aspects?"
