          "description":"The best spots are ones that receive most of this sunlight in the early morning hours. Watch your yard to see which spots the sun shines on throughout the day. If your plant looks healthy but still isn\u2019t blooming, it might not be getting enough sun. Most hydrangeas won\u2019t bloom at all in the shade. Hydrangeas are somewhat delicate when it comes to sunlight, so too much sun can burn them. If your plant has brown scorch marks on its leaves and blooms, move it to a cooler area."

Place them on the edges of shade cast by tall trees. Otherwise, create a separate space in the garden for them or pair them with other plants that won\u2019t overpower them. If you're building a big garden, grow healthy hydrangeas near plants that bloom at the same time. Some examples include foxglove, dogwood, heucherella, and various types of shrubs."

Even though hydrangeas drink up a lot of water, too much of it leads to root rot and plants that won\u2019t bloom. Organic compost causes waterlogged soil to drain faster. Purchase some compost, peat moss, or something similar from a gardening center. Mix it into the soil after digging out your hydrangea. If you\u2019re stuck dealing with pools of water over your soil, try building a raised planting bed. Build a frame out of wood, then fill it with a sandy loam from a gardening center."

The soil pH affects how your hydrangeas bloom. Aim for a pH between 5 and 8 depending on what color of bloom you are aiming for. As long as the soil doesn\u2019t have an extreme pH like 3 or 10, then it won\u2019t stop hydrangeas from blooming. Many hydrangeas produce a rainbow of blooms depending on the pH. Aim for a pH of 5.5 or lower to get blue flowers and 6.5 or higher for pink and red flowers. Anything between that is likely to produce purple. White hydrangeas, such as French hydrangeas, don\u2019t change no matter what the pH is. If you have a white hydrangea that doesn\u2019t bloom, the problem isn\u2019t the soil pH unless it is unusually low or high."

Add it in the morning to keep the soil cool and moist throughout the day. Then, let the water soak in for up to half an hour before testing the soil again. Test the soil every day by sticking your finger in it. If it feels dry, add water to keep the soil loose and moist. You may need to water your plants once every 2 days during hot, dry summers. Some hydrangeas burn through water more quickly than others. Bigleaf and smooth hydrangeas are the ones that drink up the most water. You'll need to add about 1 in (2.5 cm) of water a week to the soil. Moist soil feels loose and wet but not soggy. It sticks to your finger or any tools you push into it.

The numbers represent the ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the fertilizer, respectively. Spread this fertilizer around each hydrangea at a rate of 1 lb (0.45 kg) per 100 sq ft (9.3 m) of ground in late May or early June. Mix it up to 3 in (7.6 cm) deep into the soil to keep your hydrangeas healthy. The 12-4-8 fertilizer balance is low in phosphorus, so it is good for encouraging the unique blue blooms some hydrangeas get. If you're looking for red or pink blooms, choose something with more phosphorus, such as a 25-10-10 fertilizer. Another option is to use a fast-release 10-10-10 fertilizer. Sprinkle it on the soil in May and again in July. If you don\u2019t normally use fertilizer and notice yellow spots on the leaves, a quick application of fertilizer can save the hydrangea. Adding too much fertilizer can damage hydrangeas. You may see your plants begin to wilt and burn like they would after receiving too much sun. If you add the fertilizer after August, your plants will become too soft to survive the winter. Even though it could help you get some nice blooms during the season, it isn\u2019t worth it for the next growing season."

Keep the mulch about 3 in (7.6 cm) from the stems to prevent them from rotting. Then, let your hydrangeas grow until the next season. Add a new layer of mulch every spring to ensure your hydrangeas have a chance to bloom. Remember to water the soil thoroughly after adding mulch. Some good mulch choices to look out for include pine needles and bark. These types make soil a little more acidic, which helps hydrangeas bloom."

Look for unusual colored spots on the leaves and flowers. Green, yellow, and brown spots are some common signs that require you to purchase a fungicide from the gardening center to spray on the infected area. For example, white mildew spots are treatable. Brown spots and tan rings come from other funguses. In addition to applying a fungicide, take care of your hydrangea\u2019s needs. Many funguses come from excess moisture. Make sure you water your plants appropriately and provide plenty of air circulation. If you aren\u2019t able to treat a disease, get rid of the infected plant as soon as possible to prevent the disease from spreading.

Knowing what kind you have can help you better care for your plants and choose the right time to bust out your gardening shears. In general, there are several main types of hydrangeas commonly grown in gardens. They are easy to identify by appearance. Bigleaf hydrangeas are the most common type. They have big leaves at least 4 in (10 cm) long and often have big, puffy flowers. Mophead and lacecap hydrangeas are a few examples. Smooth hydrangeas like the Annabelle variety grow over 6 ft (1.8 m) tall and can tolerate hotter climates. Annabelle hydrangeas have those big snowball flowers that grow 12 in (30 cm) thick. Panicle hydrangeas like the PeeGee have large, cone-shaped flowers. They are more resistant to cold weather than other types. They are often very large, as in 25 ft (7.6 m) tree height. Like the name suggests, oakleaf hydrangeas have the same star-shaped leaves as oak trees. The leaves also turn colors in the fall. These plants have white, cone-shaped flowers. A climbing hydrangea is a type of vine. It spreads slowly but produces tiny, white flowers that are ball-shaped like lacecaps."

Then, use a pair of gardening shears to remove weak or damaged stems. Cut these stems all the way to the ground to give the new stems plenty of space to grow and make more vibrant flowers next year. Bigleaf, or French, hydrangeas work this way. They don\u2019t need much pruning, so trim good stems back to the first healthy buds. Remove the flowers as they fade by the end of the growing season. You can cut off approximately \u2153 of the plant\u2019s stems to make it grow back stronger next year. Oakleaf hydrangeas also bloom on old wood but don\u2019t need much pruning.
