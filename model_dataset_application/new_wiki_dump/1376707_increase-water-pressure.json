Fix any leaky pipes you encounter.Note: The supply line typically enters the house from the side in mild climates, or from the basement floor in cold climates.

Going too far can damage your plumbing. If adjusting the PRV doesn't make any difference, shut off the water supply and disassemble the valve. You may need to replace a part or the entire valve, or just clean the parts. Finding manufacturer instructions is recommended.
