  "text":" Crushed candy mints jelly Get some non flavored jelly. If you mix mint into flavored jelly, it will turn out very strange and not particularly minty. Get some mints. Small swirl ones are better than, say, blue mints. The softer they are the easier it will be to crush them. Crush about 10 mints (depends on how you want it to taste). Crush them as finely as possible because you don't want a whole lot of large chunks, but leave some chunky for texture. Make the jelly and add the crushed mints. Mix it lightly, but don't over mix it because they jelly will get overly liquidized. Put it in the freezer overnight. This lets it become more solid and easier to eat and scoop. Add any edible topping (sprinkles, etc). Whatever you want, as long as you like it. Fresh mint leaves and fruit jelly Add the apple quarters, lemon juice, the unchopped mint leaves to a large, heavy based saucepan or pot. Add water, just enough to cover. Simmer. Cook until the apples turn very soft. Add the vinegar. Simmer for another 5 minutes. Strain the mixture. Push the jelly through a thick jelly bag or doubled up muslin. Don't force the mixture through, let what will drip through go through. Measure the liquid. For every 250ml/8 oz/1 cup of liquid, add 250ml/7 oz/1 cup of sugar. Pour the liquid and sugar into a clean pan. Use low heat. Cook until the sugar dissolves. Stir frequently. Increase the heat. Boil for 5 minutes without stirring. A proper consistency will form when the temperature reaches 105\u00baC/221\u00baF. Add the chopped mint. If using coloring and flavoring, add now. Stir through. Pour the jelly mix into sterilized jars. Leave 1/4cm to 1/8 inch from the top of the container. Cover and seal the containers. Store in a cool and dark place. Serve.
