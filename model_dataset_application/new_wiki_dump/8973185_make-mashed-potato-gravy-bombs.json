  "text":" Preparing the Ingredients Pour the gravy into an ice cube tray. Pour enough gravy into each mold, making sure it reaches the top, but doesn't spill over. Freeze the gravy for about 4 hours, or overnight, until solid.  Remove and slice the gravy cubes. Use a knife to cut each cube into four small pieces. To make the cubes easier to cut, allow them to soften for a few minutes after removing them from the freezer. A knife that's been dipped in hot water can also make slicing easier. Combine the mashed potatoes with the cheese and spices in a large bowl. Mix the Parmesan cheese, cream cheese, salt, and black pepper very well with the mashed potatoes until the result is creamy. Place the beaten eggs, flour, and breadcrumbs in three separate bowls. Use bowls that are deep, so it's easier to roll the mashed potato balls in the coating. Frying the Potato Bombs Preheat the oil in a deep fryer to 375\u00b0 Fahrenheit (190\u00b0 Celsius).  Cover each gravy cube with two tablespoons of mashed potatoes. Gently roll the mixture around to form the a ball that covers the gravy cube. Repeat until there are no more gravy cubes and mashed potatoes. Roll the balls in the flour. If necessary, gently tap or shake them to remove any excess flour. Dip the balls into the beaten eggs until they're completely covered.  Cover the balls with the breadcrumbs until they're fully covered.  Fry the mashed potato gravy bombs until golden brown. Allow them to cook for about 3-4 minutes. Only fry a few at a time to prevent them from sticking together while they're cooking. Place the cooked balls on a paper towel on a plate. Continue frying the remaining balls until all of them are cooked. Serve. The mashed potato gravy bombs are best warm, after a few minutes of cooling.
