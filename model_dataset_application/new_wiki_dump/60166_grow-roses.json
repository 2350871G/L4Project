          "description":"Did you know there are 13,000 varieties of roses? Some roses grow better in certain regions than in others. When you're choosing what type of rose to grow, take some time to research the specifics of your growing region, then look for roses that have characteristics you find appealing. Take their shape, size, and color into account when choosing varieties to grow. Roses fall into the following categories: \nHybrid tea roses are beautifully shaped, colorful roses that often make appearances in flower shops and as part of bouquets. Floribunda roses are the most colorful of all the varieties. Each bush has many blossoms, rather than just one to a stem. Grandiflora roses are a cross between the hybrid tea and Floribunda roses, and they grow to be quite tall with several rose clusters to a stem. Climber roses can be trained to stretch vine-like along fences and walls. Miniature roses are intricate and tiny, perfect for planting in a container. Shrub and landscape roses are quite hardy, resistant to pests and disease. They come in many colors, shapes and sizes. Tree roses are roses that have been grafted to a long stem, giving them the appearance of trees. They require a bit more care than some of the other types of roses."

          "description":"Once you've picked out the types of roses you want to plant, decide in what form you want to buy them. Bare roots are the roots of roses that are planted directly into the ground. You can also buy young roses that have already been planted in a small pot, and transplant them to the ground or another pot. Either type may be purchased in a nursery. Rare rose varieties may be found online. Bare root roses are planted in early spring, giving them time to take root before sprouting several weeks later when the weather warms up. Potted roses can be kept inside during the winter, then placed outside in the spring."

          "headline":"Get rose gardening supplies.",
          "description":"Aside from the bare root or potted plant itself, you'll need a few other supplies to get your rose garden started. Go to your local nursery or check out online retailers to pick up the following:\nPruning shears. Pruning roses keeps them healthy, promotes the growth of blooms, and keeps them in a pretty shape. Shears are essential equipment for growing roses. Get small curved-edge shears and larger lopping shears. Gardening gloves. Protect yourself from thorns with a thick pair of gloves. Fertilizer. Roses should be fed with fertilizer a few times a season. You can buy fertilizer specifically formulated for roses, but this is not strictly necessary. Mulch. Mulching rose beds can help keep pests away and distribute more nutrients to the roses. Get wood chips, pine needles, peat nuggets, or another type of mulch suitable for your area. Compost or rose planting mix. Mixing this with the soil when you plant the roses helps them grow. A shovel and spade. You'll need these to dig holes when you plant the roses."

          "description":"You'll need a spot that gets at least 6 hours of good sunlight a day. Choose a spot that's not crowded with the roots or branches of other plants and trees. The soil should be loose and have good drainage; if yours has a lot of clay, loosen it and add some gypsum pellets before planting. Roses do best when the soil has a pH of 6.3-6.8. To determine whether a site has good drainage, walk around it after a good soaking rain. If the soil is damp, but not waterlogged, it should be fine. If you see puddles or large mud spots, you'll need to find another site or work on this one to make it more conducive to growing roses."

The measurements don't have to be exact, but a hole this wide and deep will be suitable for most roses. Mix the soil you removed from the hole with compost, and use some of it to form a small mound in the base of the hole. Add some bonemeal or rose fertilizer. If you're planting more than one bush, allow several feet of space in between, so the roots have room to grow and stretch."

The rose's bud union should be located about 2 inches (5.1 cm) below the surface of the ground. If you live in a colder region, you may need to plant your roses deeper to protect them from low temperatures. If you're planting a potted rose, loosen the soil around its roots to expose them before planting it in the hole.

Spread 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of small pebbles at the bottom of each pot to ensure good drainage and fill each with halfway with well-draining soil. Plant the roses just beyond the graft point and then water well. Place your containers somewhere sunny in the greenhouse and arrange them so that the roses don\u2019t shade each other out. They will need at least 6 hours of direct sun per day. Prune the plants severely after planting, trimming each branch back about 3 inches (8 cm) from the main stem. Water the plants so that the soil stays slightly moist, but don\u2019t allow the water to touch the stems or leaves. Mulch the containers with a 2-inch layer to retain moisture in the soil, and fertilize the plants with water-soluble rose food every two weeks once new growth begins. Keep your greenhouse temperature at around 60 \u00b0F (16 \u00b0C) during the day and 40 degrees at night for optimal growth."

Stop fertilizing the roses at the end of the summer, just before Labor Day. Some fertilizers are slow-release, so they don't have to be applied as often.

          "description":"Pruning roses keeps them both beautiful and healthy. The goal is to clear away crowded areas to open up the bush, which helps prevent rotting and disease. The pruning strategy differs according to the season, but the cut you make is always the same: prune just above a bud eyes, the areas where branches form. They look like small circular swells and are usually located above a set of mature leaves. Make a down-slanted cut on an outward-facing bud eye. It's very hard to over-prune a rose, since new growth is always directed to the next closest bud eye. Keep this in mind when you choose bud eyes to prune, as it will affect the shape of your rose bush. Remember that the key is to prune with an eye toward opening the bush's growth up to allow for air circulation. In the late winter or early spring, trim the dead canes away. Cut away the rootstock, also called suckers, which are smaller offshoots of the main plant that suck away the nutrients from the rosebush. Leave 8 or so canes, trimmed back to 1/3 of their height. This will promote healthy growth as the weather warms up. In the summer, remove deadheads, which are dead blooms. This encourages new blooms to grow."
