But if you price it too low, you won\u2019t get all the money it\u2019s worth. To select the best price, consider the condition your TV is in. If your TV is fairly new and there are no defects or scratches, you may be able to sell it pretty close to the original price. However, if it\u2019s an older TV, you may need to lower the price significantly. One idea is to look at online listings to see how much other people are selling similar TVs.
