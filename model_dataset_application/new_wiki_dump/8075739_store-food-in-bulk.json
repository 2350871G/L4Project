Whether it\u2019s a spacious basement or a cramped pantry, measure the dimensions so you can fill all of that space effectively with appropriately sized containers. Whether you\u2019re just trying to reduce the number of shopping trips you make each year, or if you\u2019re prepping to survive the zombie apocalypse, knowing exactly how much space you have to work with will help you store as much food as possible. If you are planning on buying a freezer dedicated to bulk storage, consider open floor space versus wall space when deciding between an upright or a chest freezer."

          "description":"In addition to long-term storage, appoint a second area in your kitchen to store small containers of the same items for immediate use. Eliminate the hassle of digging through your long-term storage area for that one cup of rice you need right now. At the same time, reduce the risk of disorganizing your carefully arranged storage area when you\u2019re in a hurry. Having long-term and short-term containers will allow you to repurpose long-term containers as they empty. For instance, transferring the last of your dried peas to a smaller container in the kitchen will free the larger container for those dried red lentils that just went on sale."

          "description":"Choose between the wide variety of sizes, shapes, and materials (glass or plastic). Factor in the amount of space you have available, as well as how much of a given item you intend to buy. Whatever you choose, make sure the container\u2019s lid forms an airtight seal to preserve the food\u2019s freshness and keep out pests and outside elements. With plastic containers, make sure the exact plastic used is food-safe to prevent unwanted chemicals from leaching into the food. If storage space in your kitchen is limited, use clear containers. Whether their design is plain or decorative, this can be more pleasing to the eye if you have to store them out in the open. For long-term storage, consider a double-line of defense by bagging food before transferring it into the container."

          "headline":"Use creative solutions.",
          "description":"When you\u2019re faced with limited space, consider other options. Instead of limiting yourself to obvious choices like the pantry or cupboards, expand your horizons. Brainstorm ways to add shelving or other forms of storage by less obvious means. For example:\nIf there is space between the top of your cabinets and the ceiling, use it. Stand containers on top of the cabinets. Add a shelf between that and the ceiling if space allows to create even more storage space. Use containers as decor throughout your living space. Install decorative shelves wherever you please, or use containers as bookends on existing bookshelves. Keep plain-looking food (like white flour or rice) in the kitchen while displaying more colorful items (like green and red lentils) elsewhere. Install new shelves inside pantries and cupboards to create more surface area. Clear existing shelves of smaller items (like canned goods and small bottles) by installing wire racks behind the door. If you have more vertical space than horizontal, shop for containers that are easily stacked on top of one another."

Fill them directly from the store\u2019s bulk containers to eliminate the need for unnecessary bags. Fill them all the way up each time. Weigh them once you are done.

With clear containers, you can probably identify most items by sight, but still make a point of labeling long-term containers with the purchase date. Ensure a steady rotation so you don\u2019t end up eating the dried chickpeas you bought last week while the ones you bought three months ago sit unlabeled behind everything else. Do the same with frozen-food packages to minimize the loss of quality caused by prolonged freezer burn. Use permanent marker to prevent the writing from wearing off. For containers that are reused (as opposed to frozen-food packaging), secure a piece of paper to the side or top with strong tape along all four sides to create each new label."

Kill any insects that may have found their way into the store\u2019s bulk bin. At the same time, extend the food\u2019s shelf life by slowing down the natural breakdown that occurs in all foods. Climate (especially one with high humidity) can reduce the shelf life of many foods, even when safely stored in airtight containers and cool, dark places. If you live in such an area, research each food item to decide which may benefit the most from long-term storage in a freezer or refrigerator. If adding an extra fridge or freezer to your home isn\u2019t possible, readjust the amount you buy at a time to ensure that you use all of one purchase in a timely manner."

Go the extra mile and record each time you refill short-term containers from long-term ones so you can keep track of how full or how empty the long-term containers are. Doing so will help prevent you from needlessly buying more basmati rice when you have a full bucket shoved all the way in the back and out of view. Including the purchase date will also help alert you to what should be used soon while it\u2019s still relatively fresh. Additionally, this is a great way to double-check if you are buying more of one item than you really need."
