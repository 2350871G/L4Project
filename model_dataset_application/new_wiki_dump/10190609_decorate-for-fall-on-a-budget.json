          "description":"If you have vases that you typically use for flowers, consider swapping flowers for branches with colored leaves. If you live in an area where colorful autumn foliage is common, you can easily just find a branch in your yard or neighborhood to use. Before bringing anything from outdoors in your house, spray it down with water and let it dry inside the garage or another sheltered space. This minimizes the chances of bringing any bugs into your home. Don\u2019t remove branches from anyone else\u2019s yard. You always want to be respectful of other people\u2019s property!"

          "description":"If you are able to collect some colorful fall leaves, you can preserve them by brushing a light layer of decoupage or a related product over their surface. You can then adorn your table or mantel with these leaves without fear of them drying, losing their color, or breaking. Decoupage refers to an art form that involves gluing paper to other surfaces, but it also commonly refers to the type of sealant that is used to do this. Mod Podge is a popular brand of decoupage, as it functions as a glue, sealant, and finish all in one."

          "description":"Pumpkins are an integral part of fall decor, and you can usually find them at grocery stores for relatively cheap! There are several ways you can creatively incorporate pumpkins into your fall decor. Remove the insides of the pumpkin and fill them with your favorite seasonal flower. Taller pumpkins work best for this, but the shorter ones can work too if you cut the flower stems short. Carve or paint them to make them one-of-a-kind. You can add your own designs to the pumpkins, or simply change their colors. White, gray, and other neutral-colored pumpkins can make for chic accents on a front porch or mantel. If you\u2019re not keen on the mess involved in carving pumpkins, consider buying fake ones! They\u2019re a worthwhile investment, because you don\u2019t have to replace them year after year."

You can lay it length-wise on a table, and then arrange smaller pumpkins, gourds, corn husks, etc. around it. Remember to sanitize the item before bringing it into your home. Rinse it down with water and let it dry. Don\u2019t break a tree branch off of a tree for this purpose. It\u2019s best if you happen to find one that has already fallen. Don\u2019t place lit candles near a tree branch centerpiece, as this is a fire hazard."

A potpourri is a mixture of food items and spices that is meant to perfume a room. This can lend to a more warm and cozy feeling in your space. Potential ingredients for a fall potpourri are orange peels, apple slices, cinnamon sticks, cloves, vanilla extract, and almond extract. Put everything in a pot of water on the stove and let it simmer all day, refilling occasionally with water. Enjoy the delicious smell it creates!"
