For example, going from a baby pink room to a hot pink one might enable her to keep her \"favorite color\" as the unifying feature, while still giving the space an entirely different spin. As a plus, those pastel items still look good against other clean colors (aka not muddied or grayed), and can actually make a space look far more complex and sophisticated than you could with all strongly colored d\u00e9cor."

      "description":"Not only can you put up fairy lights instead of those dull, dull lamps - wrapped round the bedspread, I favour fuzzy fairy lights - but you can also change the shade to the main room light. These are cheap, and can alter a room a lot - maybe even changing the colour of the light that comes through."

If you wake up at five every morning, with the sun on your face then move your bed. If you can't get to your draws, then move them. If something puts you off whenever you work, get rid of it...or move it."
