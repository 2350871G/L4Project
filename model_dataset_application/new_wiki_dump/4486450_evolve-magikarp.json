A Shiny Magikarp is a very good trophy, and the Pok\u00e9mon that it evolves into (Shiny Gyarados) is one of the most common Shiny Pok\u00e9mon in the game. You can try to raise a Magikarp to Level 100 for a challenge. A Level 100 Magikarp will also make for pretty good trading stock, as it's really tough to get. At Level 30, Magikarp learns Flail. This is a very powerful move if your Pok\u00e9mon is injured, which can make it a risky choice. If Flail suits your playstyle, it can be one of Gyarados's most powerful moves, and may be worth holding the evolution off until your Magikarp has learned it."
