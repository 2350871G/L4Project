The bones and skins can be used in combination with vegetable trimmings to make a sizable amount of chicken stock. You can strain and store the excess bacon fat in a pan after frying up some bacon strips. After it cools down, it yields a shelf-stable cooking oil with a delicious flavor. Substitute cooking oil with sour cream or butter about to go bad if it does not adversely affect the taste. Use a small quantity of yoghurt in stew to give it a creamier and sour taste. Substitute sour cream with yoghurt and cheese for BBQ\nA smaller quantity of salad can be chopped finely and used as garnish for lentils\nUse eggs as food glue for crumb fried recipes\nAlmost all fruits can go in smoothies or juices"
