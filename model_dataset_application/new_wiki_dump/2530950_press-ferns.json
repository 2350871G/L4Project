  "text":" Harvesting Your Ferns Harvest ferns when they're dry. Flowers that have a lot of dew stuck to them will not press well, as they'll be hard to dry out. Strive to pick ferns late in the morning, after the dew has dried, or in the early evening. Pick the freshest ferns. The fresher the ferns, the more attractive they'll be after being preserved. Look for ferns that have either just bloomed or are still in the bud form. Avoid any ferns that are already wilting. Use your fingers to remove the ferns. You can use your fingers to pick ferns by snapping the stems near the base of the leaves you want. The stems should snap easily. If they don't snap after being bended a couple of times, move your fingers up slightly. The stem will probably snap easier higher up on the plant. Place your ferns between newspapers. It's easy to damage plants while transporting them home. To prevent this, carry a few pieces of newspaper or similar materials with you when harvesting ferns. Place your ferns between the newspaper to carry them home. You can also use a magazine or folders. Trim any unwanted leaves. When you get your ferns home, take them out and examine them. Use a pair of scissors or shears to snip off any unwanted or broken leaves so they look fresh and attractive. Using a Book Place your flowers between pieces of absorbent paper. Craft stores sell blotting paper, which is specifically designed to be used in projects such as pressing flowers. Lay the leaves and flowers from your ferns down flat on a sheet of blotting paper. Place another sheet of blotting paper over your ferns. Close your flowers between the pages of the book. Choose a thick, heavy book for the process. Something like an encyclopedia or a heavy biography works well. Place the papers containing your ferns roughly in the middle of the book and then close it. It's also a good idea to label the book with the type of flowers you're pressing and the date. Weigh down the book. Set the book in a safe place where it will not be disturbed. Place heavy items on the book, such as paperweights or other heavy books. The extra weight helps with the pressing process. Remove the ferns when they're done. Check the ferns after two to three weeks. They should be delicate, crisp, and dry to the touch. If the ferns still appear soft or wet, leave them in for a few more days. Remove the ferns as soon as they're dry. Using a Flower Press Drill holes in plywood. Take two pieces of 9 by 12 inch (23 by 30 centimeters) plywood. You can purchase these at most hardware stores. Use a power drill to drill a hole in each corner. The precise size of each hole doesn't matter as long as you can fit wing nuts into the hole later. Place your ferns between two pieces of paper. Purchase blotting paper at a craft store. Lay your fern leaves flat against one sheet of paper. Then, top this sheet of paper with a second sheet. Sandwich the ferns between the plywood. Place the blotting paper that contains your ferns on one piece of plywood. Place the other piece of plywood on top of the first, sandwiching the ferns between your press. Close your flower press with wing nuts. You can buy wing nuts at any hardware store. Screw your wing nuts into each hole. Twist the ends of the wing nuts to close your flower press tightly. Remove the ferns after about a month. Place your press somewhere where it will not be disturbed. Leave it for about three to four weeks so the ferns can dry out.
