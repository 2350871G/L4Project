Cross the laces over again and thread them from the inside out through the next set of eyelets.Tip: Put the Ultra Boosts on your feet if you want to tie them using the runner\u2019s loop so you can tighten the shoes on your feet as you go and get a snug fit. You will now have only the top set of eyelets remaining to lace."

This is a good casual way to tie your Ultra Boosts if you want a relaxed look, but it\u2019s not secure enough if you want to use them for athletic activities.

If the tips do look like they are too close to the ground, then loosen up all the laces a bit more to shorten the amount that hangs at the end.
