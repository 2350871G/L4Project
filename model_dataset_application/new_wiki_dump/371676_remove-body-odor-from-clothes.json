          "description":"Put clothes in a laundry basin, bucket, sink, or tub. Add enough warm water to that they are all completely submerged. Add two cups of baking soda to the basin. Stir it around a bit so that the baking soda is dispersed into the water. Let sit for at least several hours, if not overnight. You can also soak your clothes in a washing machine. Add your clothes to the machine and turn it on, so the basin of the machine begins to fill with water. Once the basin is filled, add two cups of baking soda to the basin and stop the machine. You should then let your clothes sit in the water and baking soda for a couple hours."

          "description":"It's necessary to wash the baking soda out of your clothes after they have soaked. If washing by hand, use a normal amount of laundry detergent. You may need to change the water several times to get all of the soap and baking soda out. If using your washing machine, just turn it back on and add laundry soap, as usual. You can also try this method with vinegar. Add one cup of vinegar to your laundry and allowing it to soak for several hours, however, after soaking your clothes in vinegar water, you will need to wash them with bleach-free detergent. Combining bleach and vinegar will create toxic fumes that are hazardous to your health."

          "description":"If that is not possible, you might consider laying your clothes out on a towel to dry. Wring the clothing out so that it is not dripping wet and lay it flat on a towel. Leave the clothing to dry for 24 - 48 hours. Hanging or laying your clothes out to dry will help your energy bill as well as your laundry. If you have not gotten all of the body odor out of your clothes during washing, dryers tend to lock the odors in place."
