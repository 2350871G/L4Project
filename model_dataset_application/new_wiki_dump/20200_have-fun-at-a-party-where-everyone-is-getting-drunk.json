It can lead to fellow party goers coming to the conclusion that you are judgemental about their alcohol use. It can also come off as self-centered because people generally do not want to hear at length about a person's health choices. Choosing not to drink is always acceptable. You do not have to justify yourself or feel you have to. Rarely do people actually really care if you choose to drink or not. Generally at a party alcohol will be offered but other party goers are not interested in what you are drinking."
