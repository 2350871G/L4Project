Grab a 9x13 baking dish and spread the softened, unsalted butter over the bottom and sides. Make sure everything is thoroughly covered, because the butter will keep your sliders from sticking. Plus, it'll make the bread extra buttery."

You want to cut your Hawaiian rolls in half, so that there is one large top and one large bottom. Think of the entire loaf as one very large roll! Slide a knife into the side and carefully wiggle it through the entire piece. Set the top aside, and put the bottom of the rolls into the pan."

Spread half of your provolone cheese slices across the bread so that it is covered. Top it with your roast beef and the French fried onions. Grab the rest of the cheese and put it on top of that. Finally, top your masterpiece with the top of the rolls!"

Whichever way you do it, make sure the sliders are completely coated with the mixture. This adds a lot!"

As soon as it begins to boil, reduce the heat and let it simmer. As the sauce simmers, it will thicken up."
