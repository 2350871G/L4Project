Use a spoon or a spatula to scrape all of the hummus from the bowl or package that it\u2019s in. Press the hummus down into the corners of the airtight container to maximize the amount of hummus you can store. Most types of Tupperware will seal airtight, as will generic brands of plastic food-storage containers. Avoid freezing your hummus in a plastic bag (i.e. a Ziploc), as the hummus could be crushed or jostled. Also avoid freezing hummus in a glass jar, as this could shatter if dropped from the freezer."

If you were to fill each container completely, the freezing hummus would lift the lid off. For example, if you have enough hummus to completely fill two large plastic Tupperware, instead use three of the containers and leave an inch of space at the top of each."

You can pour the olive oil straight from the bottle. Alternately, if you\u2019re concerned about pouring too much, you could pour from a measuring cup. You don\u2019t need to measure the olive oil though, just pour enough for a thin layer of oil to form over the hummus. If your hummus were to dry out in the freezer, its consistency would become grainy and the hummus would taste badly freezer-burned."

This will help you keep track of how long the hummus has been frozen, and how much longer you can leave it in the freezer. If you have stored your hummus in a plastic container, but would like to be able to reuse the container once the hummus has been eaten, you can place a strip of scotch tape along the top of the container.

If you doubt that you\u2019ll be able to eat all of your frozen hummus within 6\u20138 months, ask friends and family members if they\u2019d like any.

Try sprinkling some paprika, cumin, or black pepper over the top of your hummus to add fresh flavor. You can also finely chop an onion, a bell pepper, or even a clove of garlic and add these flavorful ingredients to your thawed hummus. All of these spices will be available at your local grocery store. You can also check a health-food store or a shop that specializes in spices for more variety, and for fresher spices."
