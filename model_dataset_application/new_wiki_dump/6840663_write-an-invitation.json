For instance, if you are not including children in your event, you may want to include a polite notes reminding your guest that their plus one should not be younger than a certain age.

If you or a friend have great handwriting, you can even hand letter the invitations. Use high-quality paper that feels like a card or has an interesting texture. You can also create weight by layering your invitations. Starting with a standard card-sized printed invitation, you can add a thicker, colored sheet of card stock that is slightly larger to the back with a small amount of glue or double sided tape. If you want to personalize your invitations and save time, consider using custom stamps. You have a personalized note or a picture turned into a rubber stamp.

Most programs allow you to upload your own custom designs or use a standard template, so you can streamline your invitation process. In addition to making the design process go more quickly, you'll also be able to send the invites immediately via digital file and receive RSVPs right away, which is great for tight timelines."
