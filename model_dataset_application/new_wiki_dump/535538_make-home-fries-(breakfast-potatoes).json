  "text":" Par-boiling the Potatoes Get a pot of water to a rolling boil while you cut the potatoes. Make sure not to fill it to the top so the water doesn\u2019t spill over when you add the cut potatoes. Add the potatoes to the boiling water. Scrape the potatoes off a cutting board using a knife. Add the potatoes slowly and carefully so the boiling water does not splash you. It\u2019s best to wear a mitten-style potholder just in case. Boil the potatoes for no more than four to five minutes. You are essentially partially cooking them here, but not all the way through. Any longer than five minutes, and you will overcook them before they are fried. If your cubes are very small, do not boil them for longer than three minutes. While the potatoes are boiling, get a deep skillet (frying pan). Use a cast-iron or non-stick pan and add the oil. Any of the following oils will do just fine: peanut oil, canola oil, sunflower seed oil, or just plain vegetable oil. Olive oil will work but is generally not the best of oil for frying.

It\u2019s better to start on the cooler side with the burner on medium and work your way up from there if you are not sure of the correct temperature. Frying the Potatoes Add the strained potatoes carefully to the oil. Again, being careful not to spatter hot oil on your hands or arms. Wear a full oven mitt just in case or at least a long-sleeve shirt. Cover the entire bottom of the pan with potatoes but don\u2019t pile them on too high.
