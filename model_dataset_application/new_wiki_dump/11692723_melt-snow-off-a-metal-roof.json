          "description":"These are also called deicing cables, and they can be found at your local hardware store or online. Use a ladder to carefully reach the top of your roof and use the clips that come with the cables to attach the cable to the roof. Position the cable so that it goes in a continuous 'W' shape along the edge of the roof, melting any snow that comes to the eaves. Since the most snow and ice gathers at the edge of your roof, the heat cables help prevent this icy build up. The cables will need to be plugged in to a power source so they're working properly. Read the instructions that come with your specific brand of heat cables to be sure they're installed correctly."

          "description":"When your roof heats up and melts the bottom layer of snow or ice, the water leaks down to the edge of your roof and freezes again, creating an ice dam. To help prevent this, fill up a pair of pantyhose with the salt you\u2019d use to get rid of ice on your sidewalk and tie off the ends. Place this vertically on your roof near the edge so it will melt a section of snow and ice, creating an area where the water can leak off. Purchase sidewalk salt, also called calcium chloride, from your local hardware or big box store. Gently toss the tied-off pantyhose onto the edge of your roof to begin melting the snow."

Wear gloves to protect your hands from the chemicals and throw small handfuls of the deicer onto the roof so it can start melting the snow. Try to cover your roof in an even layer of the deicer.

Continue pouring or spraying warm water until the snow starts to melt.

Hire a professional to insulate the floor of the attic and install air ventilation. This will help seal off any gaps that let air pass through while also ensuring the air flows correctly. Since heat rises, it\u2019s common for the heat to escape out of the roof and begin melting the snow, forming ice dams.

Spread them out evenly, referring to the instructions that come with the snow guards for the exact placement. Have a professional install the snow guards if you're worried about damaging your metal roof. Purchase snow guards from your local hardware or home improvement store.
