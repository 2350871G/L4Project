Some ideas include:\nA beach side theme, perhaps with shells, starfish, seaweed, crabs, dolphins, etc. A cabin theme, with moose, logs, bears, pine trees, etc. A pattern design, such as circles, squares, lines, etc. A holiday theme, with baubles, trees, angels, Santa, etc. A Halloween theme, with ghouls, witch hats, wands, stars, etc."

      "description":"Lay the tablecloth over the table you're planning to use it on once completed. Look around the cloth to see where placement of the stencil designs would look most effective. Decide where you want the stencils to go and draw up a pattern on paper to follow; or, if you have a complicated pattern, consider marking it out direct on the tablecloth using a disappearing fabric marker. Some questions to help you work out a design include:\nDo you want just a sprinkling of stencils in a corner? Do you want a border of stencils? Do you want a pattern of stencils? For example, a fan, circle, animal shape or some other design which the pattern follows around or forms the shape of?"
