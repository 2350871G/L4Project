Water bottles are made from a variety of plastics, and these plastics, like BPA, can leach. Exposure to BPA has been linked with diabetes and cardiovascular disease in humans. A more suitable alternative for a refillable water bottle would be a stainless steel or glass bottle. These do not leach."

          "description":"A bottle meant for reuse will typically have a wide opening that will allow you to clean the bottle easily. Refrain from drinking from a refilled, disposable plastic water bottle. Disposable plastic bottles are hard to clean, so they can easily host bacterial growth. They also contain chemicals which could cause cancer or reproductive health problems."
