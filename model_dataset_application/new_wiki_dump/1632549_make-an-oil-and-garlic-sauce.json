  "text":" Making the Pasta Fill a large pot three-quarters full with water. Put the pot on the stove and set the burner to the highest setting. Bring the water to a boil, and then add half of a pound (227g) of pasta.  Cook the pasta until tender, but not too soft. This is called \"al dente\" in Italian. Place a colander in the sink and drain the cooked pasta, but reserve 1/2 cup (120ml) of the liquid in a different container.  Set the pasta and liquid aside.  Making the Sauce Place a 10-inch (25.4cm) skillet on the stove and set the burner to medium heat. Medium heat will help the ingredients cook properly without scorching them. Add a small amount of extra virgin olive oil to the skillet.  Add a crushed clove of garlic when the oil is hot. Sautee the garlic until it turns golden. Remove the garlic with a slotted spoon and discard. Crush the garlic with a garlic press, small mallet, or press down on the garlic clove with the flat side of a knife. Add approximately 2 handfuls of fresh flat parsley to the hot oil and garlic mixture. Toss the parsley gently to coat with oil. The parsley adds color and a subtle, fresh flavor to the sauce. Lower the heat on the stove to simmer or to a low setting. The lower heat will keep the parsley from burning. Putting it all Together Add the cooked pasta to the skillet.  Use a slotted spoon to gently fold the pasta into the sauce.  Add the reserved liquid 1 tablespoon at a time if the pasta appears too dry. Stop adding the liquid when the pasta and ingredients are completely coated but are not watery. Remove the skillet from the heat.  Transfer the prepared pasta to a serving platter or pasta bowl and serve immediately. ",
