Use the soft brush to gently wipe away anything caught in the crevices and then vacuum it up. For best results, use a gentle flicking motion with the bristles of the brush on the surface of the wood. A soft brush will also prevent damage to the wood because it employs a gentle touch. Additionally, you can use a microfiber mop or broom."

          "description":"Using a microfiber cloth to gently wipe the surface of a piece of unfinished wood is a simple and easy technique for cleaning the wood. This method is best for surface dirt that is not ingrained very deeply. Just run the microfiber cloth along the surface of the wood to pick up any excess dust and dirt. Make sure the microfiber cloth is clean ahead of time. You can wash it in the sink with soap and water (and then let it fully air dry) or you can wash it in the washing machine and toss it in the dryer before use."

          "description":"In order to keep your unfinished wood from needing more aggressive cleaning techniques, it\u2019s best to perform regular cleaning maintenance. If you let the wood remain untreated, you will eventually be forced to do more potentially damaging treatments to get the wood clean. This means that you should dust or sweep your unfinished wood often (at least once a week), as well as wiping it down with a microfiber cloth a couple of times each month."

Wipe the unfinished wood and vacuum up any fragments that become loose.Be careful not to rub the stiff bristles on the wood to harshly, as this may damage the wood. This method is most effective on unfinished wood that is already in good condition."

          "headline":"Use adhesive rubber.",
          "description":"This natural rubber product is often used to clean unfinished wood. It is very sticky and pliable, meaning that it can be forced into the smaller crevices on the surface of the wood and the dirt will be attracted to it and stick to the rubber. Apply the rubber to the surface and gently knead it to work it into the grain of the wood. As it becomes darker (this means it is attracting a lot of dirt), you can tear off the top layer to reveal fresh layers to do more work. This method is especially effective for areas that are harder to reach with other cleaning techniques."

          "headline":"Employ erasing compounds.",
          "description":"Erasing compounds are elements used to remove dirt from bare wood surfaces. Simply apply a small amount of the erasing compound on the surface of the unfinished wood and use some cotton balls to work the cleaning material into the grain of the wood. Gently swirl the cotton balls in circular motions for best results. Once finished, vacuum up the remnants of the erasing compound from the surface of the wood. Be sure to avoid rubbing the wood too harshly as this could cause damage. Once the erasing compound turns grey in color, it is no longer effective and you should reapply."

Dampen a towel with the solution and gently wipe the surface of your unfinished wood. Be sure to wear gloves while you are handling the mineral spirits and avoid directly inhaling the fumes. Because this is a type of liquid treatment, you must be very careful and apply the mineral spirits sparingly to avoid damaging the wood."

At the very least, it will most likely leave you with a finished product that is different from what you expected or intended to happen. Using a wet cleaning method can also cause the wood to become harder to finish later, if that is part of your eventual plan for the unfinished wood."

Choose a small, inconspicuous piece of the wood that won\u2019t be too noticeable if you do accidentally damage the wood. Try to choose a piece that is on the backside of the wood or otherwise less visible for your testing. Additionally, choosing several small pieces to test ahead of time will also help ensure that your chosen cleaning method will result in an overall consistent surface for the finished product."

          "description":"When you are cleaning unfinished wood, it is very important to work slowly and to use a gentle hand. The finish or varnish applies to many types of wood protects it from the elements and from being damaged very easily. Without this, unfinished wood is quite susceptible to scratches and other kinds of destruction. Use cation when brushing the surface of the wood or using the vacuum on the wood. Being too rough can cause visible and lasting imperfections."
