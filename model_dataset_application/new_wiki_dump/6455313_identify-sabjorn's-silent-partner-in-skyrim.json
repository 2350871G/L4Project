      "description":"Enter the Meadery through its large main doors at the front and inside you\u2019ll find the new owner, Mallus Maccius. He\u2019s a pale-skinned man with long brown hair and shadowed eyes. Approach him and press the designated \u201cSpeak\u201d button on your game controller as prompted on the game screen to talk to him. He will then say a short talk on what he will do with the meadery. Afterwards, he will give you Sabjorn\u2019s dresser key."

      "headline":"Enter Sabjorn\u2019s room.",

Once you\u2019re on the second floor, walk along the hallway and you\u2019ll find a door at the end of it. Go through this door to find Sabjorn\u2019s room. If you already reached this area without talking to Mallus Maccius first, you\u2019ll find the door locked. The dresser key that Mallus gives to you unlocks this door to Sabjorn\u2019s room."
