Most new telescopes come with the exact center of the primary already marked, but if yours is not marked, you can do it by simply sticking a round piece of white paper in the exact center (take your time doing it: it must be the EXACT dead center). It won't trouble your observing as long as your piece of paper is smaller than the secondary mirror's diameter. I recommend using a piece of paper with half inch diameter (or 1 cm)."
