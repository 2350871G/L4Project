Then press 1 nail about 1 inch (2.5 cm) into each potato near the end. Once the nail is secured, press a piece of copper wire into the opposite end of the potatoes, as far from the nail as possible. Each potato should have 1 nail and 1 copper wire sticking out of opposite ends. Make sure the nail and wire aren\u2019t touching inside the potato."

Connect each of the following:\nConnect the copper wire in the first potato to the positive (+) terminal in the clock's battery compartment using the first alligator clip.
