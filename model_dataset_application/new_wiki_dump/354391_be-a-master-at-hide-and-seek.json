If the seeker doesn\u2019t feel like doing a thorough job in a certain room, you might be able to get away with an unexpectedly clever hiding spot. For example, if there\u2019s a room that\u2019s divided by a sudden closet or angular wall, try hiding against the side of this surface. If the seeker doesn\u2019t peer all the way around the corner, they might not notice you."

Take advantage of the ruffles in the drapes as you position yourself behind them, and stand as still as possible! This works best with floor-length drapes, so your feet aren\u2019t noticeably sticking out on the bottom. Don\u2019t pick this type of hiding spot unless you\u2019re comfortable with standing for a long period of time."

Don\u2019t worry if there\u2019s clothing in the hamper; if anything, this makes your hiding spot more convincing! Take out the clothing and get into the bottom of the basket, then cover yourself with clothing! Make sure that you have enough room to breathe when you\u2019re doing this."

Be sure to wear clothes that you don\u2019t mind getting dirty or dusty."

Even if it takes you a little bit longer, try to go to these outer areas and make yourself as flat and 2-dimensional as possible. While this might be a little risky, there\u2019s a chance that the seeker won\u2019t notice you if you\u2019re hiding in plain sight. To make the hiding spot more convincing, wear neutral-toned or darker clothes when you\u2019re playing the game.Tip: Prepare yourself for ticks whenever you play outside. Whenever possible, spray yourself with an insect repellent and wear clothing that contains permethrin. Also, check any exposed skin once you\u2019re finished playing an outdoor game."

Many games employ a rule of 50 seconds, while other people have opted for a shorter time span. Keep this amount of time in mind so you can plan for the perfect hiding spot. While it\u2019s fun to be ambitious, don\u2019t go for an impossible-to-reach hiding location. The longer it takes you to hide, the greater the chances are that the seeker will find you early on."

Since there\u2019s a good chance that they won\u2019t check the room for awhile, hide in that spot after the seeker leaves.

Instead, look for multi-colored areas where you can try and blend into the background. Try and use decoys whenever possible. If there\u2019s a bedroom or couch in your hiding area, stuff a few pillows under a blanket and lay it on the surface.

As tempting and clever as it might originally seem to hold your breath, you might find yourself in trouble once your lungs need more air. Instead, imitate military breathing exercises and take low, slow breaths. If you\u2019re quiet, the seeker won\u2019t be able to detect you by sound! Practice this type of breathing throughout the day, even when you\u2019re not playing the game. This will help you gain expertise for future rounds of hide and seek!Tip: While you\u2019re taking low, slow breaths, avoid shifting your body.
