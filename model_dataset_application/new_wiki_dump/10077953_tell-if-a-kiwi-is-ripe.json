The seeds of a ripe kiwi will all be black and the flesh of a ripe kiwi will have a bright green color if it is a green kiwi and bright yellow flesh if it is a golden kiwi. If your kiwi is not ripe, the seeds may be green or yellow and the flesh will not be as brightly colored."

Remove the thin skin, with a peeler, a knife, or by scraping it off with a spoon, and then cut off a slice of the fruit. The flesh should be soft and squishy and the flavor should be sweet. An under ripe kiwi will not be sweet and will be firm instead of soft. While you can eat the skin of a kiwi, many consider it unpleasant due to its fuzzy texture."
