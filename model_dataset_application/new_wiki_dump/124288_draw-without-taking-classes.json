Instead, start with an outline. The edge of your dog is a line between the dog and the environment. Make your line with short strokes. The shorter you make your line strokes, the steadier your drawing will appear. Don\u2019t critique your work. Move fast and hone your stroke."

          "description":"Shading is a little more difficult, but it gives your drawings a sense of light and depth. Observe which way the sun shines on your subject. Start with a clean, sharp pencil and make even marks on partially dark areas. As the lead tip wears away, move towards the shadowed areas. Press harder to leave darker marks. This can be practiced by doing a shading bar. Start at one end of the paper. Move your pencil back and forth as you move across the paper. Apply more pressure to transition to darker marks. Value bars are also good practice. Divide a rectangle into five sections. Leave one end white. Darken the other end as much as you can. Layer your lines in the squares in between to make different shades of gray."

You might make a table out of a series of rectangles and cylinders or a snake out of a series of circles. Once you can imagine the blocks that make up an object, you will have the creativity to draw them without having a model. Spend time observing subjects, figuring out how you can fit them into your forms."

After you\u2019re done, try drawing the subject from different angles. For example, a square nose with a circle cheek and triangle ears can form a side view of a horse, but there are many other perspectives. Refer back to these sketches to improve your other drawings."

Use shapes to create a basic outline of the subject, then refine the details and clear up mistakes. With more practice, you\u2019ll be able to draw poses from memory. Simplifications are okay and can lead to your own style. For example, it would be too time-consuming to memorize every muscle in a body."

In addition, pencils come in many varieties that can help you expand your range when shading. For pencils, HB (#2) is standard. Pencils in the H range are harder and make softer lines. Pencils in the B range are softer and make darker lines. Pencils go from HB-9. In H pencils, 9 is maximum hardness. In B pencils, 9 is maximum softness. Vinyl and gum erasers are gentler on paper than rubber erasers but they don\u2019t streak color. Kneaded erasers are shapeable for removing individual details."

Imagine shading around someone\u2019s eye and sketching in the iris and pupil, for example. This imagination is how you gain insight into how to make your lines and compose your style. The goal is to see the details instead of the labels. Instead of thinking of the eye, think of the lines and colors you\u2019ll fill in to form the eye."
