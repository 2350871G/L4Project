Prune your plant in January if you live in a warmer region. In warmer regions where it does not get cold enough for roses to shed their leaves, pruning should be done in January and all of the leaves and flowers should be pruned off. This will allow the shrub to have a brief rest before producing new foliage and flowers in late winter or spring."

White Meidiland roses need to be deadheaded. Deadheading is the process of removing flowers as they fade or die. Deadhead the flowers as soon as they begin to fade and remove them from around the plant. Doing this will help the plant to put its energy towards new growth.",
