You could also use an old sheet as a dropcloth. It's best to set up outdoors or in a well-ventilated area when working with paint. If you're using spray paint, consider wearing plastic goggles, a dust mask, and plastic gloves to protect your face and hands."

Shake the can of spray paint and hold it 6 in (15 cm) to 8 in (20 cm) away from the box. Spray 1 thin layer of paint on the surface. Wait until the first coat dries before deciding whether you want to do a second coat. You may only need 1 coat. Allow the box to dry for 48 hours before using it."

          "description":"You can drastically transform the look of your boxes with the right spray paint! For example, use a metallic silver spray paint on plain plastic storage bins to make them look like galvanized metal. You could also play around with a mix of gold and brown spray paint to create a wood-like appearance. Choose between matte, glossy, and textured spray paint to create a finish that matches your vision for the project. To protect the paint from scratching or chipping, you can go over it with a coat of polyurethane after the spray paint has completely dried."

For example, you could place the tape in vertical or horizontal lines on the box for a cool striped effect. Just apply paint between the pieces of tape and let it dry for 24 hours before using your box! Make sure the paint is completely dry before peeling off the tape."

Acrylic paint is also a great choice if you're doing any kind of precision painting or freehand design work, since you can apply it with a paint brush. You can paint the boxes solid colors or try your hand at creating polka dots or other designs on top of solid colors. If you're layering 1 color of acrylic paint over another, always let the first color dry first before applying the new one."

You can purchase stencils of letters, designs, or patterns from any craft supply store. Spray paint and acrylic paint both work with the stencils, but spray paint is the easiest and most durable choice."
