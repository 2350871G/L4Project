Before you'll be eligible to wield the White Sword, you'll need to have 5 or more heart containers. You can tell how many heart containers you have by checking the number of hearts in the upper right corner of your screen. Depending on how much damage you've taken, some of the hearts may no longer be red. Whether the heart is red or white, it still counts."
