Cooking the Spaghetti Squash Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Lay the parchment paper flat on the baking sheet so it's covering the entire top of the sheet. This will help the spaghetti squash from sticking to the baking sheet when it's cooking. Drizzle 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of olive oil onto each piece of spaghetti squash. Place the 2 halves on the baking sheet with the hollow, inside part facing up. Then, pour the olive oil over the upward-facing side of the squash so that both the hollowed-parts and cut edges have some oil on them. Then, spread the olive oil over the cut sides of the squash using your fingers. Turn the 2 halves of spaghetti squash over on the baking sheet. Now, the cut sides of the squash should be facing down on the sheet, with the rounded outside part of the squash facing up. Roast the spaghetti squash like this so it gets tender in the oven.

You just want it cool enough so you're able to touch it without burning yourself. After the spaghetti squash has been out of the oven or microwave for a few minutes, touch it with the tip of your finger. If the spaghetti squash doesn't burn you, it's cool enough.
