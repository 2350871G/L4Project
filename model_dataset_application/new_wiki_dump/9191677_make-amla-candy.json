  "text":" Preparing the Gooseberries Wash and dry the gooseberries. Rinse the gooseberries in a colander under cool water. Gently pat them dry with a clean towel. Boil the gooseberries. Place the gooseberries into a pot. Cover them with a few inches/centimeters of water, then bring the water to a boil. Cook the gooseberries until they turn soft, about 2 minutes. The gooseberries are ready when they open up into segments when pressed. Drain and cool the gooseberries. Place a colander into the sink, then pour the gooseberries into it. Gently shake the colander to dislodge any excess water, then allow the gooseberries to cool enough to handle. Segment the gooseberries and discard the seeds. Gently press don on the gooseberries, on at a time, until they split open into segments. Scoop up the seeds that come out and discard them. If you want to, you can cut the gooseberries into smaller slices. Making the Candy Mix the gooseberries with the sugar. Place the gooseberries into a bowl. Cover them with 17.64 ounces (500 grams) of sugar, then gently toss to combine. Cover the bowl tightly, then stir the contents the next day. Place a tight-fitting lid over the bowl, or cover it with a sheet of plastic wrap. Let the bowl sit undisturbed overnight in the fridge, then stir the sugar and gooseberries the following morning. Cover the bowl again, and wait 1 to 2 days. Over time, the gooseberries will release juice into the sugar and turn it into syrup. They are ready once they sink to the bottom of the bowl. This will take 1 to 2 days. Remember to store the bowl in the fridge. Transfer the gooseberries onto plate or tray. Scoop the gooseberries out of the bowl with a slotted spoon. Let the excess syrup drip back into the bowl, then place the gooseberries into a plate or tray. Spread them out evenly so they don't touch or clump. Leave the gooseberries in a sunny spot until they dry. You are ready for the next step when the candy i dry and no moisture is left. This will typically take 3 to 4 days. Finishing the Candy Stir the spices into the sugar, if desired. Pour 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) of castor sugar into a small bowl. Add your spices, then stir everything together. You don't have to do this, but it will make the candy more delicious! For colored candy, add \u00bd teaspoon of edible food coloring powder. Toss the candy and the sugar together in a clean bowl.
