Caution: Always add acids to water, not the other way around -- as, otherwise, acid spattering can occur with dangerous consequences. Start out mixing a Tbsp per gallon of hot water, and check the reaction. If it's slow acting or does nothing at all, add a little more. Use your judgment. If you have a septic system, it's not only safe but helps boost the action within your tank while cleaning sewer pipes."
