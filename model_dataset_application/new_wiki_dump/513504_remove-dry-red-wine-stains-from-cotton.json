The dish soap should be a non-bleach, non-alkali detergent product \u2013 although it's okay to use a bleach-based product if your cotton is white. Bleach might help you remove the stain, but it might also remove any other colors from the fabric! For a slightly stronger mixture, use one part dish detergent and two parts hydrogen peroxide."

Work inward, from the outside of the stain towards the center; this should keep the stain from spreading. Before you apply the soap-and-peroxide mixture, place a towel inside of the garment to keep the stain from transferring to the other side. This way, the towel will absorb the stain. If you don't want to massage the stain with your hands, or if the fabric is particularly delicate: you can blot the stain instead.
