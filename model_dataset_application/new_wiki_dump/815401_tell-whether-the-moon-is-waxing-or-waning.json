The moon doesn\u2019t create its own light, but rather shines when it reflects the sun\u2019s light. As the moon transitions from new to full and back to new again, it goes through several phases, marked by its recognizable crescent and gibbous (\"bulging\") shapes, which are created by the moon\u2019s own shadow. The moon phases are:\nNew moon\nWaxing crescent\nFirst quarter/Half-moon\nWaxing gibbous\nFull moon\nWaning Gibbous\nThird quarter/Half-moon\nWaning crescent\nNew moon"

          "description":"The moon travels the same path around the Earth every month, so it goes through the same monthly phases. The phases exist because from our perspective on Earth, we observe the illuminated portion of the moon differently as it makes its way around us. Remember that half the moon is always illuminated by the sun: it\u2019s our vantage point on Earth that changes and determines what phase we see. During the new moon, the moon is between the Earth and the sun, and is therefore not illuminated at all from our perspective. At this time, the moon\u2019s illuminated side completely faces the sun, and we see the side that\u2019s in full shadow. During the first quarter, we see half of the moon\u2019s illuminated side and half of the moon\u2019s shadowed side. The same is true in the third quarter, except the sides we see are reversed. When the moon appears full, we see its full illuminated half, while the side that\u2019s in complete shadow faces out into space. After the full moon, the moon continues its journey back to its original position between the Earth and the sun, which is another new moon. It takes the moon a little over 27.32 days to complete one full revolution around the Earth. However, a full lunar month (from new moon to new moon) is 29.5 days, because that\u2019s how long it takes the moon to return to its position between the sun and Earth."

          "description":"On the moon\u2019s journey from new moon to full moon, we see a growing portion of its illuminated half, and this is called the waxing phase (waxing means growing or increasing). As the moon then goes from full to new again, we see a diminishing portion of its illuminated half, and this is called waning, which means decreasing in strength or intensity. The moon\u2019s phases always look the same, so although the moon itself may appear in different locations and orientations in the sky, you\u2019ll always be able to identify what phase it\u2019s in if you know what to look for."

You can\u2019t see a new moon because it isn\u2019t illuminated by the sun, and because it rises and sets at the same time as the sun. As the waxing moon moves into its first quarter, it will rise in the morning, reach its height around dusk, and set around midnight. Full moons come up when the sun goes down and set when the sun comes up. As the waning moon moves into its third quarter, it will rise at midnight and set in the morning."

The moon\u2019s phases always look the same, so although the moon itself may appear in different locations and orientations in the sky, you\u2019ll always be able to identify what phase it\u2019s in if you know what to look for. Determining Moon Phases in the Northern Hemisphere Recognize that the moon waxes and wanes from right to left. Different parts of the moon are illuminated during waxing and waning. In the Northern Hemisphere, the part of the moon that is illuminated will appear to grow from right to left until it\u2019s full, and it will then diminish from right to left. A waxing moon will be illuminated on the right side, and a waning moon will be illuminated on the left side. Hold out your right hand with your thumb out, palm facing the sky. The thumb and forefingers make a curve like a backward C. If the moon fits in this curve, it's a waxing moon (increasing). If you do the same with your left hand and the moon fits in the \"C\" curve then it is waning (decreasing). Remember D, O, C. Since the moon always follows the same illumination pattern, you can use the shape of the letters D, O, and C to determine if the moon is waxing or waning.

A half or gibbous moon in the shape of a backwards D is waning. A crescent moon in the shape of a C is waning. Learn when the moon rises and sets. The moon doesn\u2019t always rise and set at the same time, but changes depending on what phase it\u2019s in. This means you can use the time of moonrise and moonset to determine if the moon is waxing or waning. You can\u2019t see a new moon because it isn\u2019t illuminated by the sun, and because it rises and sets at the same time as the sun.

Full moons come up when the sun goes down and set when the sun comes up. As the waning moon moves into its third quarter, it will rise at midnight and set in the morning. Determining Moon Phases in the Southern Hemisphere Learn which part of the moon is illuminated during waxing and waning. In opposition to the moon in the Northern Hemisphere, the moon in the Southern Hemisphere will illuminate from left to right, become full, and then diminish from left to right. A moon that\u2019s illuminated on the left side is waxing, while a moon that\u2019s illuminated on the right side is waning. Hold out your right hand with your thumb out, palm facing the sky. The thumb and forefingers make a curve like a backward C. If the moon fits in this curve, it's a waning moon (decreasing). If you do the same with your left hand and the moon fits in the \"C\" curve then it is waxing (increasing). Remember C, O, D. The moon goes through all the same phases in the Southern Hemisphere, but the shapes of the letters that indicate waxing and waning are reversed from the Northern Hemisphere. A crescent moon in the shape of a C is waxing\nA half or gibbous moon in the shape of a backwards D is waxing. A moon in the shape of an O is full. A half or gibbous moon in the shape of a D is waning. A crescent moon in the shape of a backwards C is waning. Learn when the moon rises and sets. Although the moon may illuminate in the opposite direction in the Southern Hemisphere versus the Northern, it will still rise and set at the same times during the same phases. The first-quarter moon will rise in the morning and set around midnight. The full moon rises and sets when the sun sets and rises. The third-quarter moon will rise at midnight and set in the morning.",
