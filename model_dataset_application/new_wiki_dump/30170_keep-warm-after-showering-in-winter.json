Or you can simply keep an extra bathmat or towel next to the door, and when it's time for your shower, roll it up and place it in front of the gap. While not necessary for all bathrooms, blocking drafty door gaps can be especially important for small bathrooms or bathrooms that open into very cold rooms and hallways."

Drying your hair can leave a towel wet, soggy, and without enough absorbency to get your body dry fast.

However, if you have super long locks, feel free to use multiple towels for your hair. On a very cold day, it's worth it! Super-absorbent, microfiber towels are also good options for long hair. Consider washing your hair less frequently If you're concerned about using too many towels. Most people don't need to wash their hair daily."
