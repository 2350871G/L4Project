          "description":"Unless you\u2019re washing an entire load of laundry by hand, don\u2019t use your bathtub. Instead, use your kitchen or bathroom sink, a plastic tub, or a utility bucket. Choose something that\u2019s deep but with a relatively small diameter so you don\u2019t need to use too much water. Whichever sink or basin you pick, clean it out first so as to not soil your clothes. If you have a double-basin sink, you can use 1 side for the soapy water and the other side for the rinse water."

          "headline":"Fill up the basin with warm to cool water.",
          "description":"Check the garment care label to see which temperature is recommended for the shirt you\u2019re washing. If the label indicates cold water, or if you want to avoid any possible shrinkage, fill up the basin with cool, but not frigid, water. If the label recommends warm or hot water, use water that\u2019s comfortable to the touch; it shouldn\u2019t be boiling. When in doubt, opt for lukewarm water. To wash 1 shirt, use about 1 to 2 US gal (3.8 to 7.6 L) of water. Make sure the water temperature feels comfortable against your hands. If it\u2019s too cold or too hot, you won\u2019t be able to wash your shirt effectively."

        {
          "headline":"Add about 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of detergent to the water.",
          "description":"Choose a mild liquid or powder laundry detergent. Opt for a gentle liquid hand soap or mild dishwashing liquid if you don\u2019t have detergent on hand. Or, if you prefer, try a specialty detergent designed for use with delicate clothes or wool, depending on the type of garment you\u2019re laundering. Slosh around the detergent with your hands to mix it in with the water. Add a bleach alternative product along with the detergent to help brighten white shirts. To eliminate perspiration odors from wool sweaters, add \u20444  c (180 mL) of distilled white vinegar to the detergent."

          "description":"To treat stains before hand-washing a shirt, apply a spray-on or pen-style stain remover to the stained area. Or moisten a stain-removing laundry bar and rub it onto the affected area. Gently rub the surface of the fabric to agitate the fibers and scrub away at the stain. Allow the stain-removing solution to sit on the fabric for at least 10 minutes, or up to a few hours. Different types of stains may require different stain-removal tactics. Do a little research first to make sure you\u2019re using the most effective methods to remove the stain, whether it\u2019s a result of a leaky pen, mud, self-tanner, makeup, or something else."

Agitate it gently with your hands so that the detergent can get in and around all parts of the fabric. Try swirling, squeezing, and turning the garment around in the water. Refrain from scrubbing vigorously or wringing out the garment as you might damage the fabric."

For especially dirty garments, leave them to soak for at least 1 hour. To treat stains at this stage, try gently scrubbing stains with a stain-removing laundry bar before leaving it to soak. Then allow the shirt to soak for at least 30 minutes."

Lay a towel beneath the hanging garment to catch any drips, and allow the shirt to air-dry overnight. Avoid using a wire hanger as the metal may rust and crease your clothes. Feel free to clip your clothing up to an outdoor clothesline. Just make sure you turn brightly-colored shirts inside-out so that they don\u2019t get sun bleached. If you need your shirt to dry more quickly, direct a fan towards it. Try ironing cotton dress shirts while they\u2019re still slightly damp to achieve a crisp finish."

Adjust the sleeves and body of the garment until it\u2019s in the correct shape, then smooth out any creases. Allow the shirt to dry in this position overnight. This technique works well for knit sweaters, jersey tops, t-shirts, and sweatshirts. Avoid hanging up these up to dry as they\u2019re likely to stretch out. You may also lay out woven shirts on a towel or drying rack. Use a flat-lying rack instead of draping your shirt over the bars to avoid creasing the fabric.
