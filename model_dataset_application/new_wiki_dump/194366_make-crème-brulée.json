  "text":" Heating the Cream Preheat the oven to 325\u00ba F (163\u00ba C).  Prepare the vanilla pods. Using the knife, slice down the middle of the pods and split them open. Scrape out the pulp onto a clean surface and keep the leftover pods. Add the cream, vanilla pulp, and vanilla pods to a medium saucepan set on medium high.  Heat the cream and vanilla mixture until it just begins to boil, or until soft bubbles begin forming at the sides of the saucepan. Once it starts boiling or bubbles start forming, remove the saucepan and its contents from the heat. Let the cream mixture stand, covered, for  15 minutes. Pick out the vanilla pods when the cream has finished cooling. Cooking the Custard While the cream mixture cools, whisk the egg yolks and 1/2 cup of sugar together. Whisk together until the yolks break up completely and the mixture changes to a slightly lighter color. Slowly incorporate the cream into the yolk mixture, bit by bit, stirring constantly. If you incorporate the cream in too quickly, the eggs may cook. Don't rush this step! Strain the mixture through a sieve to remove any grit.  Pour cream into six ramekins resting on a high-walled roasting dish.  Pour enough hot water into the tray to reach halfway up the ramekins. This set-up is known as a bain marie. Place the filled ramekins into the preheated oven and bake for 40 to 45 minutes. When ready, they'll be set on the edges but \"jiggly\" at the center. Transfer the ramekins onto a cooling rack.

Allow them to cool to room temperature. Refrigerate them for up to 2 hours, covering ramekins in plastic wrap.  Caramelizing the Top Sprinkle the excess sugar over each cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.
