Then, drop off your trophies and plaques during the center\u2019s operational hours. When you arrive, pay the small recycling fee. Dropping off your trophies is completely free, though recycling fees vary from center to center. They are usually around $1 (\u00a30.74) a trophy.

Box up your trophies, and address the package to the recycling center. Be sure to include your sales order number on the outside of the box, as well as your return address. Then, visit a nearby post office and pay for the shipping expenses. If your box does not have a sales order number listed, it will be returned.

Drill a hole through the center of 2 cake trays, and reassemble your trophy. As you do this, place 1 cake tray in between the main column and the base piece, and place the other cake tray in between the column and the topper.
