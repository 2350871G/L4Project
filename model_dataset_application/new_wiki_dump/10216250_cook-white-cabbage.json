Avoid buying precut or shredded cabbage. Once cabbage is already cut, it loses vitamin content, even if it is packaged well. Don\u2019t fuss over whether you should buy organic or conventional cabbage, because it\u2019s considered pretty clean and free of pesticides."

Test its weight to make sure the cabbage is heavier rather than lighter. To ensure your cabbage\u2019s freshness, store in the refrigerator until it\u2019s ready to use. Browning and markings can be signs of worm damage in cabbage."
