Be sure to sweep and mop in the direction of the wood grain. This helps prevent dirt and grime from getting stuck in cracks between planks. A microfiber towel is also great for removing dust."

After cleaning the floor, use a handheld sanding screen to roughen up the edges and corners of the room where the buffer can't access. Use a buffer with a 150- or 120-grit sanding disc to screen the floor, or buff down the existing finish. Sanding pads are color coded, with black, purple, and brown being abrasive stripping pads. Green and blue are mid-level abrasive, and tan and white pads are mild polishing pads. The sanding discs will wear out, so you'll need at least three to screen a typical room. Buffing will not remove deep scratches or heavy damage. It will, however, help restore shine and remove surface scratches to old or dull hardwood."
