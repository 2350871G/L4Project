      "description":"The object of the game is to get 500 points first. The thrower will throw the ball, saying the amount of points it will be worth for the person who gets it. The throw can say dead, which means it has to fall on the ground before anyone can pick it up. If someone catches it while it's in the air, it will count for nothing and has to be returned to the thrower. If they say alive, you must catch it before it hits the ground, and it will count for nothing if it hits the ground. If they say dead or alive, then it's basically whoever gets the ball first, no matter if they catch it in the air or if it falls on the ground and they pick it up. Whoever reaches 500 points first is the new thrower!"
