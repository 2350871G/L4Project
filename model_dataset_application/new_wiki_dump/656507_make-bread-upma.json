  "text":" Stir-Frying the Ingredients Heat the butter and mustard seeds in the pan. Set your stovetop to medium heat. This recipe calls for one tablespoon (14.79 mL) of butter, or about 1/8 of a stick of butter. Add your butter to the pan. Let it melt completely before adding the mustard seeds. Listen up, because once your mustard seeds start sputtering in the pan you\u2019re ready to move on to the next step. Stir-fry your curry leaves, green chilies, asafoetida powder, coriander, and onions. Add your curry leaves and green chilies first, letting the curry leaves wilt a bit. Then, sprinkle in your asafoetida powder and your chopped coriander. Continue stirring as you add in your chopped onions. Mix in your chopped garlic. Continue stirring constantly to ensure your ingredients do not stick to the pan. Do not let your onions turn brown. Once the onion has become translucent, you are ready for the next step. Creating the Paste Stir in your chopped tomato. Be sure to de-seed the tomatoes before adding them to the pot. Continue stirring constantly. Make sure that the tomatoes are thoroughly blended into the other ingredients. Add the turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Measure out 1/2 a teaspoon for both the turmeric powder and red chili powder, but you can eyeball the salt. Add as much or as little salt as you like. Stir in your seasonings, and continue to cook the mixture until the tomatoes are soft. Pour in the water and lemon juice.

Finishing the Dish Add the bread pieces to the tomato mixture. You can use leftover or even stale bread. Cut or tear them into small pieces. Toss them into the mixture, and stir until all of the pieces are coated. Once the bread is covered with the tomato and spices, you\u2019re all set. Sprinkle in some coriander leaves.
