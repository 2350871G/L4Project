Ideal choices include a small screwdriver or hex wrench, a hair pin, or a heavy-duty paperclip. You can even use a bamboo skewer from the kitchen, or a cotton swab with the fluff removed from one end. If using a hair pin or paper clip, first bend it open so you have a long, straight bit of metal. If you are having trouble finding a suitable object, get creative. Open up a ball-point pen and use the ink cartridge, or check the bottom of your purse for a toothpick. You can almost always find something that will work!"

You should immediately hear a click indicating the lock has been released. If the lock has a twisting mechanism, you will need to insert the tool, and sweep it around in a twisting motion until it catches on something, and then apply a bit of pressure. You will then hear a click that means the door is unlocked. When opening a twist-lock, you may need to try sweeping the tool both counter-clockwise and clockwise until the lock releases."

Find a screwdriver that fits, and simply undo these screws. Within a few minutes, both doorknobs will come off. Simply pull any remaining locking mechanism out of the hole and open the door. It is best to alternate back and forth between the two screws as you go. You may have to apply some tension to the Doorknob by pulling on it as the screws loosen. In some cases, the screws will be hidden under a decorative collar. If so, this collar must first be removed by either inserting a paperclip into a small hole on the collar that releases it (if there is one) or gently prying up the collar with a flathead screwdriver."
