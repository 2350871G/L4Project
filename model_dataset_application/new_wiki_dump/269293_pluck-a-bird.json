  "text":" Scalding the Bird Clip the wing off the bird to be plucked at the \"elbow\" of the bird with some game shears or heavy duty scissors. (clip the non-meaty part of the bird off.) Boil water in a pot big enough to completely submerge your bird.  Submerge your bird under the boiling water for a minute and a half.  Take the bird out of the water with a pair of tongs.  Hold bird by the feet while you have rubber gloves on.  Pull feathers from tail to the head.  Cutting the Skin off the Bird Cut through the hide right at the point of the breast, and continue cutting the straight line along the breast, towards the legs. Now pull the two skin edges outward, away from each other. Use the knife if the skin\u2019s being stubborn. When you\u2019re finished most of the breast should be exposed and free from skin. Fold the wings outward and forward, and cut down behind each shoulder blade.  Cut off the feet. Find the knee joint and make a few cuts into it, but not through it. When you bend the scaly part of the leg back and forth, it should break off right at the joint. Cut and pull the skin and fat off around the legs.  Cut off the wings at a good spot. One way to do it is to remove all the hide up to the first wing joint, and then cut and break off the joint there, as you did with the leg joints. Cut and pull off the remaining skin, so your bird is completely skin and featherless.  Cut the legs off, bringing the knife back along the bird\u2019s body. As you remove the meat parts of the bird, either have a helper bring them inside or find some way to keep the flies off the meat. Remove the throat. Make cuts between it and the body if you need to, and then pull. Carefully cut between the back and the gut pouch of the bird. Cut all the way around the back in a semicircle, and then pull the insides out. Do this carefully and try not to accidentally open any of the digestive track. Dispose of the insides immediately. Take the bird inside and wash all the meat thoroughly, refrigerating until use. If the bird\u2019s skin was very tough, you may want to cook it via stew or crockpot to loosen up the meat.",
