  "text":" Harvesting the seeds Choose healthy plants to source the seeds from. You'll want to pass on the best possible traits for the next bell pepper crop, so only select the plants that are growing well and are in good health. Signs of a healthy plant include good growth; ability to cope with hot, cold, wet and cool climates; well-formed fruits; uniform growth; supple branches; thick walls on the fruits; good flavor. Select the seeds from the first fruits produced on the bell pepper (capsicum) plant. The reason for this is that the germination rate for seeds from later fruits drops to around 60 percent. Harvest the seeds from ripe fruits only. This is when the seeds are ready. The bell pepper is ripe when it has changed from green to red or yellow or from light yellow to dark yellow or orange. The seeds will appear a golden yellow color; if they are still white, then they're not ready for preserving. If the fruit has dried on the stalk, the seeds can be harvested from this too. Preserving the seeds Remove the seeds from the flesh of the fruit. Do this either using your fingers to run along the flesh and pull the seeds away or by scooping them out with a small spoon. Sort out any flesh or other matter than isn't seeds. Place already removed seeds on a plate or tray as you work on removing more seeds from the flesh. You will likely get around 200 seeds per bell pepper. Check which seeds will germinate and which won't. There is a simple test using water that will enable you to remove the seeds that probably won't germinate:\nPlace all of the seeds into a small container filled with water. The seeds that won't germinate (non-viable) will float to the top. The seeds left at the bottom will likely germinate.
