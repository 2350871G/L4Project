Open them during the day if the temperature outside is higher than the temperature indoors. Keep your windows air-tight. You may want to purchase removable window caulk or plastic to better seal them. At a minimum, stuff a towel or shirt in front of any noticeable leaks."

          "headline":"Let as much sun hit your house as possible.",
          "description":"Check for obstructions (e.g. plants, sheds) that might keep the sun's rays from reaching your house. Remove items leaning against walls on the sunny side of your house. (Ideally, put them back again at night for additional insulation)."

Home improvement stores sell magnetic register covers to \"shut off\" forced air furnace registers in unused rooms. That way when the heater does click on, only the registers in the rooms you use will pump out heat. This makes for more efficient use of the heater. Check that all heat registers are adjusted open, especially where plumbing pipes might freeze. Unblock cold air returns in heated rooms (they may be blocked with furniture or rug) so heat can circulate efficiently."

          "headline":"Cook.",
          "description":"Cooking can help you to keep warm as an activity, through the oven's warmth and by eating something nice and warm after. Bake cookies or a pie. Your oven will help to dry the air and heat the kitchen. The kitchen will be warm while you are cooking, and then you can have a great home cooked meal too! After, leave the oven on and open the oven door to let some heat in the house. Only leave the oven on for ten to twenty minutes, so you don't waste energy. Limit cooking that gives off steam, as this will increase the humidity in the air and make your house damp. Lowering humidity in the wintertime helps you to feel warmer. Water vapor (humidity) has a greater heat capacity (ability to absorb heat) than dry air. As a result, humid air feels colder in winter than does dry air and it takes more heat to make damp air feel comfortable."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Light a candle.",
          "description":"A candle/candles can produce a lot of heat, just be mindful of where they are placed and do not leave them unattended. A trip to most any grocery store or discount store can provide you with a number of candles cheap! Use a candle heater. It doesn't create as much heat as a fireplace or real heater, but will create warmth very cheaply."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Turn on some lights.",
          "description":"The average incandescent light bulb releases up to 95% of its energy as heat rather than light, making it an extremely efficient heat source. Compact Fluorescent and LED lights are not helpful in warming your room, so save them for warmer days and use the money you saved to pay the heat bill."

          "description":"A lot of people say you release one-third of your body's heat from your head but despite common belief, you release heat equally throughout your body. Either way, a hat is a good friend at a time like this. A turtleneck sweater or onesie can also work wonders. Dress in layers, especially with wool or cotton clothing. Wear slippers or warm socks. When you are sitting still, wrap a thick pure wool blanket around you. You also may want to consider purchasing a thermal shirt as wearing one under your sweater makes for a comfy shirt and an increased level of warmth. If you still get cold legs, you could buy a 2-pack of black tights from your local shop. Make sure they are opaques. Wear one or more pairs over each other under your clothes; this will provide your body with another layer of clothing to trap in warm air. Men can use long johns in lieu of stockings."
