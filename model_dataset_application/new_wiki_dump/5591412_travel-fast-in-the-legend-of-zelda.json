Many versions of the game\u2014like the Ocarina of Time, Majora\u2019s Mask, and Twilight Princess\u2014will allow you to ride the horse at the very start of the game or at least near the beginning. Just play through the normal storyline of the game and you\u2019ll eventually be able to ride Epona. Epona is not available on all versions of Legend of Zelda, especially those on portable gaming consoles like Game Boy and Nintendo DS."

For games without Epona, you can still travel fast by running using the Pegasus Boots. It allows Link to dash at an incredible speed, bashing through weak enemies with ease. Unlike Epona, Pegasus Boots are quest items that can only be acquired by finishing certain missions and can only be found on the following missions of specific game versions:\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap \u2013 Pegasus Boots can be obtained after waking the sleepy shoemaker in Hyrule. The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords/ Four Swords Adventures \u2013 Pegasus Boots can be obtained randomly on Item Podiums scattered throughout the game. The Legend of Zelda: A Link between Worlds \u2013 A character named \u201cShady Guy\u201d will give Link the boots once the hero catches him in Kakariko Village. The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening \u2013 The boots can be found inside the third dungeon of the Koholint island named \u201cKey Cavern.\u201d\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past \u2013 The boots can be obtained from a character named Sahasrahla after getting the \u201cPendant of Courage\u201d from the Eastern Palace."
