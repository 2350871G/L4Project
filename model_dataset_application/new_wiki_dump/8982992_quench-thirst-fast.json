Add ice to your drink or store a pitcher of water in the fridge so you always have access to chilled water. If you need to chill a beverage quickly and don\u2019t want to water it down by putting ice in it, try placing it (in a sealed bottle or can) into a bowl with water, ice, and a generous amount of salt. This will chill it in about five minutes. For on-the-go cold drinks, fill a thermos or insulated water bottle with ice but no water. This will cause it to melt more slowly."
