  "text":" Making the Crust Place the flour, salt and butter or shortening into a blender fitted with a steel blade. Blend the mixture until it looks like crumbs. Remove the crust from the blender and place it on a cutting board. Add the water one tablespoon at a time until the dough forms a ball. Roll the crust out using a rolling pin into a 12\" (30cm) circle. Drape the crust over a 9\" (23cm) pie pan. Trim the crust with a knife until it extends from the sides of the pie pan about 1/2\" (1.25cm). Flute or crimp the edges. Poke some holes in the crust with a fork to allow steam to escape. Set the pan aside until you've prepared the filling. Preparing the Filling Preheat the oven to 350\u00baF (180\u00baC). Place the oven rack in the center of the oven. Combine the brown sugar, sweet potatoes, and spices in a mixing bowl. Beat the ingredients together for 2 minutes using either a handheld mixer or a stand mixer with a paddle attachment. Mix the condensed milk and eggs in a separate bowl. Use a fork to combine them, beating the eggs only lightly. Add the egg and milk mixture to the potato mixture. Beat on medium speed until well blended. Pour the filling over the pie crust in the pie pan.  Tap the filled pie pan on the counter to allow the filling to settle and level out.  Bake the pie for 50 to 60 minutes. Sweet potato pies typically don't brown as much as pumpkin pies, so don't concern yourself with the appearance of the filling. Poke a toothpick into the center; when the toothpick comes out clean, the filling is done. Check the pie after 30 minutes. If the edges of the crust are brown, cover them with aluminum foil while the rest of the pie finishes baking. Allow the pie to cool for 15 minutes. Slice the pie and serve it with dollops of whipped cream.",
