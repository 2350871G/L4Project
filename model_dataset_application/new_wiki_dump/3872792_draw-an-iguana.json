  "text":" Regular Iguana Draw a triangle-like shape with curved edges. Have the slimmest part pointing right. Place it near the top left side of the paper. This will be your guide in drawing the head. Overlap a long stretched horizontal oval on the triangle-like-shape's right side.  Draw a vertical line at the center of the first shape. Draw an X-shape with its center intersecting the bottom of the first shape and the vertical line. Draw one of the guidelines for the front legs by placing a small circle below and overlapping the long oval, a little to the right of the head part. Attach to it an angled line with another small circle on its tip. Continue to make the rest of the legs in the same manner. Attach a long, curving line that starts from the other side of the long stretched oval, then back to (but not touching) the head part. Using the \"X\" guideline drawn earlier (on the head part), draw the iguana's eyes.  Start drawing the iguana's mouth and nostrils. Add the head's scaly details. Trace the outline of the iguana's legs and fill in its details. The fingers should be long and pointy. Using the long stretched oval, trace the outline of the iguana's scaly and leathery body. Add the tuberculate scales (spokes) on its back starting from the neck down to about a quarter of its tail. These spokes starts longer first near the neck and decrease in length as it goes towards the tail. Finish the other legs and its details, too. Trace the iguana's tail following the long curved line drawn earlier.  Remove unnecessary lines.  Color the drawing as desired.  Cartoon Iguana Draw a circle near the top left side of the paper. This will be your guide in drawing the head. Slightly overlap a long, stretched diagonal oval on the circle's bottom right side.  Draw a smaller circle within the long oval, near the head part. Slightly overlap this circle at the low part of the long oval. Near this small circle, overlap a small, stretched oval as a guide to a front leg. Draw another small stretched oval on the end of the big long oval--overlapped and pointing at the same direction as the big long oval. To this small stretched oval, overlap another small stretched oval on its end, making an angle. Attach a triangle on the top right side of big long oval, nearest to the angled small and long ovals. From this triangle, attach long, curved lines and trace the iguana's tail. Draw a spade shape that will overlap the circle for the head. The spade-shape's point should be pointing away from the body. On this shape, draw three horizontal lines and intersect them all with a single vertical line. Start drawing the iguana's body outline. Use the little circle and ovals as your guide in drawing its legs. Remember it has long, somewhat withered fingers and pointy claws. Trace the iguana's head. Draw its eye, mouth, and nostril using the horizontal lines as your guide. Trace its front leg and the skin that dangles underneath the iguana's head. Add the tuberculate scales (spokes) at its back starting from the top of the iguana's head. These spokes start longer first and decrease in length as they go towards the tail. Finish the other legs and its details, too.  Trace the rest of the iguana's body and tail, including its tuberculate scales.  Remove unnecessary lines.  Color the drawing as desired. ",
