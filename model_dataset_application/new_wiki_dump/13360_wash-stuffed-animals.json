Add approximately 2-4 tablespoons of either baking soda, cornstarch, or baby powder to the bag, depending on the size of the stuffed animal. Seal the bag, and gently shake it with the powdered ingredient and toy inside. After shaking, let the toy sit for 20 minutes in the bag, and then remove the stuffed animal. Gently brush off any remaining powder over a garbage, or outdoors. The powder will absorb any foul odors coming from the stuffed animal. You can also use a handheld vacuum to remove any lingering powder."
