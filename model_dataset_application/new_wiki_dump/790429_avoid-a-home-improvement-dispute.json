Mediation involves a neutral party trying to bring both sides of a dispute to a compromise. The decision isn\u2019t binding, and both parties can walk away if the mediation isn\u2019t suitable. In contrast, a decision reached through binding arbitration is final. Both parties have to accept the arbitrator\u2019s decision and there is no possibility for appeal.
