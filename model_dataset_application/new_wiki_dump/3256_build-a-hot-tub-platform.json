Pound stakes in the corners and then measure the diagonals. They should be the same, about 11' 3.5\" Wrap a string around the corner stakes and make two diagonal strings to locate the center. Pound a stake at the center location. Pound stakes at the center of each side (4' from the corner stake). Now you have a cross. Measure 32 inches (81.3 cm) from the center of the cross and pound a stake at these four locations. Now find the last four stakes by measuring 32\" from two of your last four stakes as shown in the photo to the right. Repeat this for each corner. Now you should have 9 stakes inside your 8' square. These 9 locations are where your pier footings will be placed. Dig a 15\" by 15\" square hole at each of the inside nine stakes. The hole should be about a foot deep. The bottom of the hole should be on undisturbed soil. You can use the grass to fill in bad spots elsewhere on the lawn. Fill the bottom 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) of the hole with sand.

Wiggle the block until it is level in both directions. Note that the spirit level shown in the picture is lying on its side for clarity. Repeat this process with each hole and footing, making sure that the rows are aligned. You can lay a 4\" by 4\" post down the middle of the straps to check alignment. Tamp excavated soil into the holes around the footings compacting the ground so the footing can't move. Add enough soil so the ground slopes away from the footing to prevent puddles. You should now have 9 footings in a 64\" square in the middle of an 8' staked off square. You are now ready to set the posts. Before you set the posts create (3) 4\"x6\" beams by nailing two 2\"x6\" 8' boards together. Nail the beams with 10 to 12 16d nails on each side. Set the center post first. The deck will be the post height plus 12 1/2\". Determine the first post height. The second post will be the length that is level with the first post.

Adjust until they are exactly the same. Add the center beam aligned with the two outside beams. Tack one nail in each footing strap and one in the beam holder. Recruit others to fill in the nail pattern for each beam holder and footing straps with galvanized 8d nails.  Toenail a 2\" x 6\" joist to each end of the beams. Check the diagonal to be sure it is square. When you are sure it is square, wrap a string around it and fill in with the remaining joists as shown in the plan above. Nail a rim joist to the ends of the joists and nail blocking down the center.  Mark the outside joists every 6.25\" from each side. You should meet in the middle at 50 inches (see plan). Nail deck boards at each end so that it covers the rim joist. Do both ends. Have your family members nail two 16d galvanized nails through deck board into joists at the 6.25\" marks.",
