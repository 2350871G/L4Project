      "description":"Dark Valefor is the weakest among all the Dark Aeons, but that doesn\u2019t mean that she\u2019s a pushover.

To  be prepared, you will need the following:\nFully upgraded Celestial weapons with Break Damage Limit for your party (Increases the damage you can deal from 9,999 to 99,999)\nBreak HP Limit (Raises your HP limit from 9,999 to 99,999)\nAuto-Haste (Constant Haste effect that will give you more turns in battle)\nAuto-Life (Skill on the Sphere Grid, not the same as Auto-Phoenix)\nAuto-Phoenix (Automatically uses Phoenix Down on fallen party members)\nRibbon (Optional, provides protection against all status ailments)\nGood Stats (Agility, Luck, Strength, and Defense)\nX-Potions (For healing)"

If you fail to get 2 hits on the reel, Wakka will only attack 6 times."
