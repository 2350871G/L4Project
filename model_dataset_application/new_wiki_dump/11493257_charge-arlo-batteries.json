Choose a safe spot to charge the camera where it won\u2019t be disturbed or stepped on. A countertop or table works best. Don\u2019t charge the camera on the floor unless it\u2019s an out of the way spot."

Then plug the larger side of the cable into the wall adapter. Only use Arlo products to charge the battery. Other power units and cables won\u2019t work and could damage the camera or battery."

If the blinking annoys you, turn the camera around or cover it with a towel while it charges. If the light doesn\u2019t blink, check your connection. Make sure all the plugs are fully inserted."

Then reinstall the camera where it was originally. Arlo camera batteries take 2-4 hours to charge, depending on how low the battery was. Don\u2019t unplug it before the light turns solid or you\u2019ll have an incomplete charge."
