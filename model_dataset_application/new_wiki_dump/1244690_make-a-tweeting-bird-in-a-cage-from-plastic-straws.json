Take the concertina part of the straw and bend it into what looks like a bird's neck shape. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/23\\/DVC00240_35.JPG\\/460px-DVC00240_35.JPG\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/2\\/23\\/DVC00240_35.JPG\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":613,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":1013.3333333333334,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>TOHGIN minako\\n<\\/p><p>Image by: Uploader<br>\\nLicense: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}  Sideways view\nTry to approximate how it appears here. Form the bird's beak. Turn the straw around to the shorter end above the concertina part. Return to the figure set out in step 1 and follow the exact cutting points outlined there. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/6\\/69\\/DVC00243_772.JPG\\/460px-DVC00243_772.JPG\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/6\\/69\\/DVC00243_772.JPG\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":613,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":1013.3333333333334,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>TOHGIN minako\\n<\\/p><p>Image by: Uploader<br>\\nLicense: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}Pull the cut piece away to reveal the beak shape. Return to the longer side of the straw below the concertina portion. Take each of the wide pieces and bend them, then wrap them around the backbone piece, as shown. You're about to create a knot at this point. Refer back to previous steps to help you keep track of each piece. Ensure that a loophole has been created and hold the two fat pieces between your fingers, just prior to pulling into a knot. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/c\\/c2\\/DVC00247_751.JPG\\/460px-DVC00247_751.JPG\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/c\\/c2\\/DVC00247_751.JPG\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":613,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":1013.3333333333334,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>TOHGIN minako\\n<\\/p><p>Image by: Uploader<br>\\nLicense: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}Pull into shape to create a neat and symmetrical knot. Don't make it too tight as you'll need to loosen it shortly for adding the wings. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/03\\/DVC00248_425.JPG\\/460px-DVC00248_425.JPG\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/0\\/03\\/DVC00248_425.JPG\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":613,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":1013.3333333333334,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>TOHGIN minako\\n<\\/p><p>Image by: Uploader<br>\\nLicense: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}The two fat pieces (the legs that will slide into the cage piece) should be facing forward when you are finished, in front of the neck and below the beak. Loosen the knot to create a small space. Slide the wings through this space and ensure that they're sitting evenly. Retighten the knot. Finish up by tidying the short tail. Cut off the long piece so that a short tail remains, as shown by the image. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/fb\\/Bcb10_129.JPG\\/460px-Bcb10_129.JPG\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/fb\\/Bcb10_129.JPG\\/760px-Bcb10_129.JPG\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>TOHGIN minako\\n<\\/p><p>Image by: Uploader<br>\\nLicense: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}Feather the tail. As with the wings, make small evenly spaced slits to create a feathered tail look. You can stop here if you want just a bird, or you can proceed to making a cage for it as well, as outlined in Part 2. Making the cage View the figure provided here to help you understand which parts are created to form the cage.  Cut the straw. Following the image provided in step 1 of Part 2, cut the straw into eight equal parts, lengthwise. The cuts should only come as far as the valley fold line indicated on the figure. Fold each of the eight parts. Following the figure, you will need to make both mountain and valley folds, as outlined on the figure. Valley folds: Pull each of the eight pieces out from the straw (toward you if you're rotating the straw) and bend into position. The valley fold extends from the point where you ended cutting the eight pieces. Mountain folds: Looking at the diagram in Step 1, Part 2, fold each of the eight pieces that have been folded outward up toward you so that stick up like a mountain. Cut off a small portion of the uncut end of the straw. You are going to be using this piece as a ring to thread over the other part of the straw. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/a9\\/Bcc5_470.JPG\\/460px-Bcc5_470.JPG\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/a9\\/Bcc5_470.JPG\\/760px-Bcc5_470.JPG\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>TOHGIN minako\\n<\\/p><p>Image by: Uploader<br>\\nLicense: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} The resulting ring seen apart from the rest of the straw. Place the ring at the top of the eight thin mountain pieces. Make sure each piece is included; this may take some steady handwork. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/b1\\/Bcc7_557.JPG\\/459px-Bcc7_557.JPG\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/b1\\/Bcc7_557.JPG\\/758px-Bcc7_557.JPG\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":343,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":566.5454545454545,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>TOHGIN minako\\n<\\/p><p>Image by: Uploader<br>\\nLicense: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\nThread it to about three quarters of the way down the cut straw pieces, as shown here. Create curls. The curls are designed to prevent the ring piece from slipping off the cage when you push it back up toward the top. Take the ends of each cut piece of straw and roll it over firmly to create a curl shape. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/a7\\/Bcc9_678.JPG\\/460px-Bcc9_678.JPG\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/a\\/a7\\/Bcc9_678.JPG\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":616,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":1018.1818181818181,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>TOHGIN minako\\n<\\/p><p>Image by: Uploader<br>\\nLicense: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}Repeat for each piece until all are curled. Push the ring back up toward the top, sitting just under the curled parts of the cage. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/80\\/Bcc11_348.JPG\\/459px-Bcc11_348.JPG\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/80\\/Bcc11_348.JPG\\/759px-Bcc11_348.JPG\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>TOHGIN minako\\n<\\/p><p>Image by: Uploader<br>\\nLicense: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}Pull out the valley/mountain folds evenly to form the sides of the cage. Adjust until the entire structure sits together properly and looks like a cage. Combining the two pieces Gently slide your bird made in Part 1 into the cage. The legs should slide straight into the hollow at the base of the cage. Adjust so that the bird appears to be singing from through the bars of the cage. Enjoy your tweeting bird, or if you made it in blue, your \"Twitter bird\", in its cage!",
