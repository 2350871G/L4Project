Packaging makes up 30 percent of the weight and 50 percent of trash by volume for most products. Look for bulk items made of recycled content, especially for products such as toilet paper, tissues and napkins. Be aware of double packaging, even for bulk items.

          "description":"Look for items that will last for years, rather than disposable or cheaply made products. This could mean going for a more expensive clothing item, rather than fast fashion items that will fall apart in a few weeks. Skip disposable razors, a big waste culprit, and invest in a reusable shaving razor. Go for rechargeable batteries, or plug-in appliances, and reusable items. Avoid buying individually packaged items, such as candies, chocolate bars or even to-go snacks. The amount of waste these products create outweighs their convenience. Try not to shop spontaneously for items you may not need. Before you buy an item, consider how often you will use it and how long it will last. Investing in quality products means less waste and less trips to the store."

You can also find great used and unused items (especially clothing) at a low cost to you and the environment. Look in your closet for clothing you haven\u2019t worn in the last year. Rather than throw the clothes away, donate them to second-hand stores or thrift stores. You could also throw a clothing swap party with friends to encourage some friendly barter and trade for used goods.

          "description":"Food and yard waste account for about 11 percent of the garbage thrown away in most mid-sized U.S. cities. Composting scraps and waste is a great way to dispose of them in an eco-friendly way. Find a dry shady spot near a water source. Add brown and green materials, such as leaves, twigs and grass clippings, to the spot. Shred or chop any large pieces. Moisten the dry materials with water as they are added to the pile. Alternatively, you can use a round or square bin if your backyard isn't big enough for a large pile. Be sure to add dirt to the bin first before you add brown and green materials. Once your compost pile is established, mix more grass clippings and green waste, such as fruit scraps and coffee groups, into the pile. Bury fruit and vegetable waste under 10 inches (25.4 cm) of compost material. You can also cover the compost with a tarp to keep it moist. When the material at the bottom of the compost is dark and rich in color, your compost is ready to use. This usually takes anywhere between two months to two years. If you have a wood-burning fireplace in your home, save the ashes in a tin rather than throwing them out. Cold wood ashes can be mixed into your outdoor compost heap and add valuable nutrients to your garden."

Look for this bin at your local hardware store or gardening supply store, or make one yourself. Make sure you have an even amount of green material, such as vegetable waste, fruit scraps and coffee grounds, in the compost bin. Add water to keep the compost moist. Tend to the compost and keep track of what you throw in there. A properly managed compost bin will not attract pests or rodents and will not smell badly.
