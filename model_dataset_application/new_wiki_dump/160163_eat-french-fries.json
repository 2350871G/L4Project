However, sweet potato fries are tasty alternative if you want a lower carb version. You can also sometimes find non-potato fries. Other vegetables or fruits such as eggplant, yucca, and avocado are sliced into sticks and prepared in a similar fashion to classic French fries. You can also find polenta and chickpea variations."

          "headline":"Decide what cut or style of French fry you want.",
          "description":"While classic French fries typically feature sliced potatoes, there are several different ways that the fries can be cut. Some fries are sliced extremely thin, while others are thick or have a wedge-like shape. If you\u2019re simply planning to dip your fries in a sauce or condiment, any size or shape will work. For fries that are covered with toppings, a thicker fry typically holds up better. Shoestring French fries are some of the thinnest fries that you can get. They\u2019re best used for dipping in a sauce or tossed with a seasoning. Regular or traditional French fries feature julienned potatoes so they\u2019re fairly thin. They\u2019re best served with a dipping sauce. Crinkle cut fries feature a wavy or ruffled edge. They are usually a medium thickness, and work well for dipping or covering with toppings. Curly fries are cut into a coiled, spring-like shape. They\u2019re fun to dip into a sauce or condiment, but can also work well as a base for heavier toppings. Steak fries are thick and flat, and work well if you want to add toppings to your fries. Waffle fries are thick fries that features a crisscross pattern. They also work well if you want to pile toppings on your fries. Wedges are also extremely thick because the potato is actually cut into wedges rather than slices. They hold up well to heavy toppings."

However, if you prefer a low-fat diet, you can choose baked \u201cfries.\u201d They aren\u2019t as crispy as the fried version, but they don\u2019t have as much fat or as many calories either."

Try dipping them in mustard, mayonnaise, barbecue sauce, or steak sauce if you\u2019re tired of the usual ketchup.

A classic aioli, which is essentially a mayonnaise that\u2019s heavily flavored with garlic is an ideal dipping sauce for your fries if you want to give your meal an elegant twist."
