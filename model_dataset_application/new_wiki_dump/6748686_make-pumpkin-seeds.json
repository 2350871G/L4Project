Scrape out the seeds with a spoon and transfer them to a colander. If you're going to be carving the pumpkin for Halloween, you have to cut the pumpkin a different way. Two to three inches out from the stem, insert a knife into the top of the pumpkin on a 45-degree angle aimed inward toward the center. Cut a hole around the stem on this angle. Pull out the top, reach your hand in, and scrape out the insides with a flat spoon. Transfer the seeds to a colander."
