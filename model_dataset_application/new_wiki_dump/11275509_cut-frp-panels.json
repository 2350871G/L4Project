You can do this at the installation site if the environment is right, or you can bring the panels to another site that accurately represents the temperature and humidity levels they\u2019ll experience once installed. If you\u2019re working in an unfinished job site, wait until the building is sealed off and the heating and cooling systems are up and running before acclimating or installing the FPR panels.

          "description":"FRP panels will naturally expand and contract over time. Therefore, it\u2019s important to take these behaviors into consideration when you\u2019re planning out how you\u2019ll cut and space out your panels. Depending on the sizes of your panels and what they\u2019ll be installed next to, cut the panels a little bit short to leave some room for expansion around each side. Refer to the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines for exact spacing recommendations. For example, if you\u2019re cutting a panel to fit along a wall measuring 9 ft (2.7 m) wall, don\u2019t cut the panel to 9 ft (2.7 m). Instead, cut it to 8 ft 11\u00bd in (2.7305 m) so that you can leave \u20444 in (0.64 cm) of space at both the top and the bottom. Allow for at least \u20448 in (0.32 cm) of clearance around molding, piping, fixtures, and electrical boxes. The larger the panel, the more expansion space you\u2019ll need to allow for. So, for a wall measuring 12 ft (3.7 m) high, you\u2019d leave about \u20448 in (0.95 cm) of space at the top and bottom, instead of the \u20444 in (0.64 cm) needed on on either side for a 9 ft (2.7 m) high wall."

Clamp it down, if necessary. When you make your cuts, lower the blade into the back surface of each panel. Avoid cutting the FRP panels from the front side, as you might end up with some nicks or chips along the front side of the material."

          "description":"When making straight cuts through thick pieces of FRP, choose a blade with either a diamond or carbide coating that will be strong enough to cut through the material. Create longer cuts with a table saw, or use a handheld circular saw for shorter cuts or smaller panels. Move the blade slowly and steadily through the material, applying gentle pressure on the blade to avoid chipping the panel. If you\u2019re using a circular saw, just make sure you provide enough support beneath either side of the panel to avoid making incorrect cuts or chipping the surface of the material. When making cutouts, use a jigsaw to give the inside corners a radius of at least \u20448 in (0.32 cm) to prevent stress cracking."

          "description":"Whether you want to trim off the end of a panel or create a cutout in the middle, use electric shears when working with thin pieces of FRP. Try swivel-head shears, sheet metal shears, or table shears. Aline the jaws of the blades so they can bite down on the edge of the FRP. Push the shears slowly but steadily through the FRP to avoid damaging it. Unlike saws, shears work well for both straight and curved cuts. Keep in mind that most trimmers will cut out a thin strip from your material. Make sure you line up the blades accordingly so you don\u2019t shave off too much of the panel. If you\u2019re making cutouts, create a radius of about \u20448 in (0.32 cm) around the inside edges."

Avoid cutting the FRP panels from the front side, as you might end up with some nicks or chips along the front side of the material. Saw straight cuts through thick panels using a carbide- or diamond-coated blade.

Choose well-fitting personal protection equipment (PPE) when drilling FRP. Wear a dust-filtering mask or respirator over your mouth and a pair of safety goggles or glasses over your eyes.
