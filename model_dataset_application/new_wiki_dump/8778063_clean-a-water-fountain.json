A toothbrush or other soft brush is perfect for this purpose. Use a mild soap such as dishwashing soap or even CLR to clean the fountain. If your fountain is copper, make sure you only use a very soft rag on it. Keep going until the fountain is clean. If you are having trouble removing algae, you can buy products specifically made for breaking down algae. Consider wiping the fountain down with a mild bleach solution to help keep new growth from happening. If you encounter any filters that look dirty, clean or replace them. Clean smaller fountains more often (once a month) and larger fountains less often (every other month or so)."
