Make an \u201cX\u201d on it in permanent marker so that you don\u2019t accidentally install it, as it may get nicked or banged up. Line up the edge of the extra tile with the mark on the other tile where you need to make a cut. Firmly run your knife down the edge of the extra tile to score the piece that needs trimming. If you don\u2019t cut all the way through the tile the first time, repeat the process taking care to make the second score line directly over top of the first. You can also soften the tile with a heat gun to make precise cuts. Wear work gloves while working with a utility knife and cut slowly away from your hand."
