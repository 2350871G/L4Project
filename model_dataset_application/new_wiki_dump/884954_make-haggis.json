Mince them into very small pieces, as small as you can manage. Trim off any gristle or skin from the meat and throw the trimmings away. If you're having trouble mincing the meat, try grinding it in a food processor or with a cheese grater. Always use caution when cutting with sharp knives. Ensure your cutting board is on a firm and stable surface when you're mincing the meat."

Stir in 1/2 pound of suet, 3 medium onions that have been minced, 1 cup (225 g) of toasted pinhead or steel-cut oats, 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of kosher salt, 1 teaspoon ground black pepper, 1 teaspoon of dried coriander, 1 teaspoon of mace, and 1 teaspoon of nutmeg. Stir in a few tablespoons of the water from your pot into the mixture just to moisten it. Avoid adding so much water that the haggis mixture binds together into a ball. You want to keep it loose enough to fill the casings."

If you see any air bubbles form, take a sharp skewer and poke the air so that the haggis doesn't burst. Avoid splashing the hot water as you lower the haggises.

You can cut into the haggis while it's still hot, but the haggis will spill out of the casing and you won't be able to cut it. Consider serving the haggis with neeps and tatties (swedes/rutabaga and mashed potatoes)."
