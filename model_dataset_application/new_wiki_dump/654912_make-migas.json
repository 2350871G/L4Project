  "text":" Preparing the Tortillas Slice the tortillas into strips. Place them on a cutting board and use a knife to slice them into 1/2-inch strips. It's easiest to stack the tortillas and cut them all at once. Heat a skillet or frying pan over medium heat. Pour in a pat of butter or a tablespoon of vegetable oil and heat it for a few minutes. Fry the tortilla strips. Lay the strips in the hot butter or oil and let them cook on one side for about 20 seconds.

If you wish you can fry the tortillas until they get quite crunchy, like tortilla chips. In fact, tortilla chips may be substituted for tortillas in this recipe if you have them on hand. Cooking the Vegetables and Eggs Cook the vegetables. Heat more oil in the skillet over medium heat. When the oil gets hot, toss in the diced onions and peppers. Let them cook for a few minutes, then use a spatula to stir them around. Continue cooking the vegetables until the onions turn translucent and the peppers get slightly soft. Scramble the eggs. While the vegetables are cooking, crack the eggs into a large bowl. Use a whisk or a fork to stir them, breaking the yolks and mixing them together until you have a sunny orange liquid. Whisk in a few dashes of salt and pepper to taste. Pour the eggs into the skillet. Try to distribute the egg mixture evenly across the bottom of the skillet. Let it cook for a minute so that the bottom sets a bit before finishing the migas. Finishing the Migas Lay the tortilla strips into the skillet.
