  "text":" Steps Start off by drawing a horizontal egg shape for the body of your guitar.  Draw a long rectangle at the end of the egg shape for the fret board.  At the start of the rectangle, inside the egg-shape, draw a circle.  Draw a small rectangle at the end of the fret board.  Now add the thickness of the body. This thickness will be determined by the shape you want the guitar. This tutorial will use the basic shape. Add the details like the strings, the fret divisions, and the tuning knobs.  Ink the drawing and erase the sketch.  Color the drawing and you are done!  Alternate Method Draw two ovals. The one on the left should be larger than the one on the right, like a lopsided snowman. Add two rectangles and one line to connect all the shapes. The upper rectangle will serve as the neck of the guitar, and the line is the beginning of a string. Connect the ovals by adding two lines. Add small rectangles to give the guitar a boxier, more realistic shape. Draw a small circle inside of the smaller upper oval. Add semicircles on the sides and tighten up your lines to make your guitar even more real-looking Draw two wavy lines to indicate the shape of the guitar. (At this point you should really begin to see it start looking like a musical instrument; if it doesn't, go back and make sure you haven't distorted anything.) Erase excess lines as seen. Draw six lines to render the strings of the guitar. Draw other details like the tuning pegs and frets on the neck. Outline and color the drawing. Use shades of brown, unless your guitar is unusually colorful. Experiment with different shading and patterns to find out what looks the best.",
