          "description":"Although the pit doesn't have any special abilities, it will keep the center of your avocado green. That's because the pit prevents air from circulating around the center of the avocado. Leaving the pit in your avocado is an easy way to keep part of the avocado green. If you're cutting the avocado into small pieces or mashing it, then you may not be able to leave the pit in place."

          "headline":"Submerge the cut avocado under water in an airtight container.",
          "description":"Place the avocado cut-side down in an airtight container. Then, fill the container with enough water to cover the avocado. Seal the container, then store it in your refrigerator. The water will protect your avocado from the air, keeping it green. However, some people think it makes the avocado feel slimy. This technique usually keeps your avocado green for about 2 days.Tip: If you don't have a food storage container, use a recycled plastic food container, such as an old sour cream container, instead. Just be sure to pick one that has a lid and is washed clean."

          "description":"You can place the onion next to the avocado or below it. The sulfur compounds in the onion act as a preservative, but the smell of the onion shouldn't alter the taste of your avocado. When you're ready to use your avocado, you can either incorporate the red onion into a recipe or scrap it. This technique also works for guacamole! For guacamole, dice the red onion and sprinkle it on top of the guacamole. Then, serve the guacamole with the red onion as a topping, or stir it to incorporate the red onion into your recipe."

Next, press the plastic wrap up against the surface of the avocado, and make sure there aren't any air pockets below the plastic. If you don't have plastic wrap, put your avocado in an airtight container. However, the plastic wrap may work best with citrus juice.Variation: You can store the avocado in just plastic wrap, but you may still end up with a brown avocado. Similarly, you can try using the lemon juice by itself, but it's most useful when paired with the plastic wrap."

The vegetable oil will prevent air from touching the surface of the avocado. You might also try using avocado oil, if you have any. You may find that this makes your avocado feel oily.
