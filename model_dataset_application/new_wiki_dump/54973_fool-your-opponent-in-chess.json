          "description":"Intentionally leave one of your pieces unprotected, or at least make it appear unprotected, to trick your opponent into making a rash move. Baiting is the one of the most basic strategies in chess, but also one of the most consistently successful. The \"Legal Trap,\" for instance, involves sacrificing one's queen in order to place the opponent's king in checkmate with minor pieces. Many of the most complex strategies and sequences in chess are sophisticated forms of baiting. Make sure you\u2019ve played out every possible follow up move in your head before putting one of your pieces at risk. EXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVitaly Neimer\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternational Chess Master\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVitaly Neimer is an International Chess Master and Certified Professional Chess Coach with over 15 years of training experience. He has been a part of the United States' Webster SPICE national chess champion team and is also a two-time Israeli national chess champion. Vitaly Neimer\t\t\tInternational Chess Master\t\t\t\tYou can try fooling your opponent by going \u2018all in\u2019 like in poker. Try sacrificing a piece for an attack. You might fool him, or you might give him a sacrifice. Sometimes, though, your opponent won\u2019t accept the sacrifice because he\u2019s afraid. He thinks you know something he doesn\u2019t."

          "headline":"Intimidate your opponent with superior positioning.",
          "description":"Even if your opponent has more pieces on the board, you can neutralize their advantage by getting your strongest pieces into clear, well-guarded positions. A good example of this type of placement is to set up one of your rooks at the \"7th rank\" (one row before the end of your opponent's side of the board). From there, the rook is able to keep the enemy king from escaping, all while picking off your opponent's minor pieces and being free to advance or retreat as needed. The \"Blockade\" is another fundamental defensive play that relies on cunning placement rather than capture or evasion. Setting up a blockade is as simple as blocking the path of your opponent's pieces so that they can't advance. While the opponent struggles to get around the blockade without losing valuable pieces, you can use your dominant position to lure them into danger, or escape danger yourself. Superior positioning can discourage your opponent from following through with their plans and force them to play the game you set for them. If you\u2019re careful and don\u2019t leave any obvious openings, you may psyche your opponent out and put them on the defensive. Controlling the board is often preferable to simply having more pieces."

        {
          "headline":"Think several moves ahead.",
          "description":"It\u2019s not enough to simply move one piece, with no thought to the consequences it could have multiple turns down the line. Winning strategies require forethought, and are often devised half a dozen moves or more in advance. Do your best to predict how your opponent will logically respond to the moves you make, and adjust your tactics accordingly. Look over the options they have as well as your own. Try to \"X-Ray\" the board. X-Raying refers to a skilled chess player's ability to see where his or her pieces may be in a good position to attack or defend along a continued plane of movement, beyond the most immediate openings. Learning to X-Ray the board can help teach you to be more forward thinking with your moves. Take as much time as you need each turn to decide on a move that will have the most beneficial outcome. Never move a piece without first having an attack or escape plan ready."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Examine the entire board.",
          "description":"In order to determine your best course of action, you\u2019ll often have to look at the playing field as a whole, rather than just the squares around the piece you intend to play. A broader perspective will let you spot hazards and openings you might otherwise have missed. Pay particular attention to the position of you and your opponent\u2019s king and queen pieces, as well as pieces they seem to be moving with clear purpose. If you\u2019re being judicious and weighing your options, you\u2019ll be able to thwart your opponent\u2019s plans while carrying out your own. It can help to be able to identify whether a game is \"open\" or \"closed.\" When a game is open, it means that many of the crucial squares near the center of the board are unoccupied, whereas these spaces reach gridlock in a closed game. Certain pieces, such as the bishop and queen, will have an advantage in open games where they have more room to maneuver. In closed games, pieces like the knight and pawn shine, as they can capture in close range and move around and in between stationary pieces. Chess operates on the principle of action and reaction. Analyze your opponent\u2019s movements closely. Ask yourself what you would do if you were in their position."

        {
          "headline":"Be patient.",
          "description":"Don\u2019t get in a rush to win. This is especially critical during the final stages of the game, where you will be eager to score a checkmate but may be overlooking critical mistakes. When played seriously, chess should take a while. You should be prepared to survey the board, take inventory of your pieces and form a new plan of action every time your turn comes up. Sometimes, the winner will be the player that can think ahead and outlast the other. Don\u2019t move pieces around haphazardly whenever it\u2019s your turn. Think over your options at length and only move when you\u2019ve decided on the best strategy. If you\u2019re preparing to make a move as soon as your opponent sets a piece down, you\u2019re not giving yourself enough time to assess the current situation, and it could cost you the game. A single game of chess can sometimes take days, months, or even years to complete."

          "headline":"Rely on your most versatile pieces.",
          "description":"Some pieces can move further or in more directions than others. These should be the ones that do most of the legwork on the board. The rook, for instance, can traverse an unlimited number of squares either forward, backward or to either side in a single move; the bishop can do the same in a diagonal direction. Knights can move across two spaces and up one, allowing them to navigate out of tricky situations and capture pieces in surprise attacks. The more movement options you have, the better able you\u2019ll be to pull off the strategy you\u2019ve laid out. Train yourself to think of playing pieces in tandem with one another. Use your turns to set them up, then make it so your opponent has no way out. Remember that while some pieces have abilities that others don\u2019t, they are each useful under different circumstances. Not every piece is meant to be played the same way."

          "headline":"Use pawns to protect valuable pieces.",
          "description":"Position pawns around pieces that you can\u2019t afford to lose to keep them from being taken. One of the advantages of pawns is that they have strength in numbers, making them ideal for defensive blocking. When enemy pieces approach, you can either capture them with your pawns or hold your position until your opponent makes a mistake, then follow up by mobilizing powerful pieces. This is why it\u2019s not a good idea to recklessly sacrifice your pawns. Inexperienced players too frequently sacrifice pawns, leaving their important pieces less protected. Pawns are also capable of being promoted to rook, bishop, knight or even queen pieces when they reach the opposite side of the board."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Take control of the four center squares.",
          "description":"As soon as the game starts, jockey your pawns to take as many of the four center pieces of the board as you can. You can then begin to move your other pieces in the center as the game progresses. The center position of the board is key to controlling the game, as it allows the most mobility, especially for versatile pieces like the knight and queen. Controlling the center gives you more freedom of movement, but it also puts you at more risk of being surrounded by a veteran player."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Protect your king at all costs.",
          "description":"Never make any movement without first considering whether it endangers your king. The game is over when either you or your opponent's king is cornered and can no longer escape. For this reason, the royal pieces, the king and queen, are without question the two most important in chess (the queen is the most mobile as well as the most evasive, and forcing the king into a checkmate is the key to winning the game). Use carefully considered positioning and offensive moves to defend the king while deftly whittling away your opponent\u2019s pieces. While the queen is the most versatile (and therefore the most powerful) piece on the board, losing your queen puts you at a terrible disadvantage unless you manage to promote a pawn to new queen piece. Be cautious with your queen and do whatever you can to keep her on the board as you enter the endgame (the final stages of the game when the kings come into play). One basic defense strategy is to \u201ccastle\u201d your king by moving it over two squares and \u201cjumping\u201d it with a rook that\u2019s in the same rank, so that the rook is placed beside the king. This gets the king out of harm\u2019s way while putting the rook in position to intercept an opponent\u2019s threat."
