          "description":"If the room you're going to be working on is quite large, or if you're removing several layers of paint and wallpaper, it might be prudent to rent a steamer instead of trying to strip everything off by hand. Steamers can be rented by the hour from home and garden centers. They come with a steam canister and a nozzle that you run over the walls to help loosen the wallpaper with steam. Steaming typically makes the job easier and faster. However, if you're working with wallpaper that has been painted over by more than one layer of paint, steaming might not work, since it's difficult for the steam to penetrate all the layers. In this case you'll need to strip everything off by hand. Steaming is a greener alternative to using a chemical wallpaper stripper. A steamer operates using plain water, no chemicals required."
