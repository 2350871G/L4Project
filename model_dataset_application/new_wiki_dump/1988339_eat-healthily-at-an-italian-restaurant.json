          "description":"Whether you are eating in a restaurant or eating at home, it is important to pay attention to how much food you put on your plate. This is the best way to eat healthy while eating Italian food. Even if you select a lower fat option, eating a large portion will still add excess calories. If you are eating at home, then you can use a measuring cup to ensure that you only consume one serving. Check the pasta package and any sauce you are using to find out what the recommended serving sizes are, and then measure out that amount. For example, if the recommended serving is one cup of pasta and 1/4 cup of sauce, then measure out these amounts. If you are eating in a restaurant, then you might ask the server how much pasta and sauce comes with an entr\u00e9e to get an idea of how many servings will be on your plate. Then, you can request a to-go container right when your meal arrives and box up half of the portion before you begin eating. This will help to prevent you from consuming an overly large portion."

You might even consider splitting an entr\u00e9e with a friend or family member to cut back on the calories. For example, if the entr\u00e9e has 800 calories, then splitting it with someone would cut the calories down to 400. Then you could each have a side salad with some light dressing for a complete meal that is under 500 calories."

That will prevent you from consuming too much of it. For example, if you want to try the tiramisu in a favorite Italian restaurant, ask someone in your group if they want to share it with you. You could even order a couple of desserts for your whole table to share and request extra spoons or forks so everyone can have a few bites of each item."
