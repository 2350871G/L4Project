Not to mention, the more free space you have in your cupboards, the more clutter you can hide away in those cupboards. Use vertical, tiered storage racks to create additional shelf space inside tall cupboards. This kind of shelving is available in the home goods or kitchen sections of most general retailers. Install utensil hangers on the inside of the doors of your cabinets. This way, your utensils will still be convenient, but will still be out of sight."
