At the third stop, 2 people get off, and at the last stop, everyone gets off. The question is: What color are the bus driver's eyes? A boat has a ladder with six rungs. Each rung is one foot apart. The bottom rung is one foot from the water. The tide rises at 12 inches (30.5 cm) every 15 minutes. High tide peaks in one hour. When the tide is at its highest, how many rungs are under water?"

Just before the truck crosses the bridge, a 2 pound tree limb falls and lands on the roof of the truck and remains there as the truck crosses the bridge. But the bridge does not collapse. Explain. In New York City, you see a school bus from one side. It is extremely modern. In fact, the front of the bus looks exactly like the back! All you can see is a row of windows on the side of the bus (but, you cannot see in the windows). Which direction is the bus traveling, to the left or to the right?"

When he returns two hours later to the locked car, alas, his wife has died. The strange thing is, there is someone in the car he has never seen before!!! Explain."

You need to get all three across a river in a boat. The boat so small you can only carry one (fox, chicken, feed) at a time. Yet, you get them all across without anything being eaten. How? (Hint: which of the two can you leave alone together on one side of the river?) A regiment of soldiers needs to cross a deep and fast flowing river. The bridge is out and their only chance is a small boat with two boys in it. The boat is so small it can only hold two boys or one soldier.

Two golf balls of same dimension and weight are dropped simultaneously into the barrels. The golf balls are dropped from the same height. Which ball will touch bottom first? You are on an island in the middle of a lake deep in the heart of Alaska. There is a tractor on the island that did not arrive by boat or by air.
