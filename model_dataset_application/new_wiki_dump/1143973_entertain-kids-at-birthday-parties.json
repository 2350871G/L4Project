          "description":"A theme helps encourage involvement and makes decorating easier! Ask your child what theme they\u2019d like. Once you have a theme, it may be easier to brainstorm decorating ideas and/or activities. For example, planning the decorations for an outdoor competitive adventure party is very different from the decor one might expect at a princess party. When decorating, consider banners, balloons, streamers, or other colorful decorations!"

          "headline":"Set up a scavenger hunt.",
          "description":"If your child\u2019s party calls for a scavenger hunt, prior set up is required. When creating the scavenger hunt, make sure you\u2019re coming up with clues that are challenging without being too hard! For more active children, consider a scavenger hunt that takes place both inside and outside. For older children, consider a scavenger hunt with cryptic riddles and multiple steps. For younger children, consider a scavenger hunt that can be accomplished by all of them together, with simple, easy-to-follow clues."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Prepare an arts and crafts activity.",
          "description":"When deciding what arts and crafts to do, keep the children\u2019s age in mind! Easy arts and crafts allow you to sit back, while more involved arts and crafts often require adult supervision. Some easy arts and crafts activities include squirt gun painting, egg carton animals, and canvas painting, while more involved arts and crafts activities include troll bookmarks and string art. Consider how messy the activity will be. A very messy activity might be better outside! Make sure you buy all of the supplies in advance!"

          "description":"Not only are musical activities great at keeping kids entertained, they also have the added benefit of being easy to set up. Set up a speaker and a Freeze Dance game, grab some chairs and play Musical Chairs, or, if you have the budget, rent a karaoke machine for some singing action. Even a simple dance party can often entertain kids that love music and dance."

          "headline":"Take the party outside.",
          "description":"If your house has a yard or if you live near a park, consider having an outdoor party. Bring a soccer ball or frisbee and set up a game or, for children who don\u2019t like sports, set up a tie dye t-shirt station or a flower-crown braiding competition."

          "description":"If you have a pool or are able to rent one out, consider throwing a pool party. Pool parties do require more adult supervision, but they also provide a space for unlimited fun with few to no additional items required. If you don\u2019t have a pool but live close to the beach, that\u2019s another great option! If you are throwing a party that involves water, make sure all of the children can swim! Make sure to bring sunscreen if you are going to be out in the sun all day."

Natasha Miller\t\t\tEvent Planner & CEO, Entire Productions\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: It's really smart to bring in entertainment that is specifically for kids.

Keep in mind you\u2019ll need to buy face painting paint, though those sets often include instructions. Try to teach a few adults to face paint, so you can paint more than one child\u2019s face at a time! Also, make sure there is at least one adult supervising while you face paint."
