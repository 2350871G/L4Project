Tell the difference by:\nHair: Bees appear furry all over. Wasps and hornets may have a small amount of hair on their bodies, but you\u2019d need to inspect them very closely to see it. Food sources: Bees nourish themselves from flowers\u2019 nectar. Wasps and hornets prey on other insects and/or scavenge food waste.

They usually don\u2019t use home structures to build their nests but are sometimes found in roofs, attics, and wall cavities if there is access from the outside. Bumblebees typically nest in or near the soil, such as in deserted rodent nests, compost piles, or underneath raised outdoor structures like sheds or porches. Carpenter bees usually burrow into wood to build their nests. Look for bee activity around coin-sized holes in things like eaves, porches, and trimming."
