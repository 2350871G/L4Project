          "headline":"Order a favorite main and a healthier side or vice versa.",
          "description":"Another option to keep fast food meals a little bit more nutritious is by doing a 50/50 deal between a favorite item and a more nutritious item. For example, if you're craving a bacon, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich \u2014 go for it. But instead of the hash brown as a side, get the fruit cup instead. By making that 50/50 deal you're increasing the nutrition of your overall meal and most likely saving yourself a few calories as well. Many fast food restaurants offer healthier side items to their meals. You may need to read the entire menu to see what they offer. However, fruit cups, apple slices and baby oranges are more common and more available."

          "headline":"Choose a leaner protein source.",
          "description":"One negative of some of the common breakfast options at fast food restaurants is the high fat meats they serve. If possible, try to choose a leaner source of protein. Some fattier meats that are served are not only higher in calories, but also higher in saturated fats. Try to avoid these or do not eat them on a regular basis. Eating bacon and some other processed meats has been linked to a higher risk of colorectal cancer and cancer in the lower stomach. Breakfasts meals or sandwiches that have bacon or sausage will have higher levels of fat and calories. Choose leaner protein like ham, Canadian bacon, turkey bacon, turkey sausage, cheese or eggs. Many fatty cuts of meats are high in saturated fats. This type of fat, if eaten regularly or in larger quantities, can increase your risk of heart disease and stroke."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Cut out high-calorie breads and pastries.",
          "description":"Fast food restaurants also serve a lot of high calorie breads, pastries or sugary breakfast items. These, like saturated fat, can cause health problems if eaten regularly. Refined carbohydrates include sugary foods and those made with white flour. They're typically high in calories and sugar but low in overall nutrients. These foods have more of a negative impact on your cholesterol than saturated fats. Bagels, waffles, pancakes, croissants, English muffins and rolls are all common versions of processed, refined carbohydrates. Try to limit or avoid how often you order breakfast items that contain these foods. If you can, always choose 100% whole wheat or whole grain options. For example, the Starbucks turkey bacon and egg white sandwich is served on a whole wheat English muffin."

        {
          "headline":"Stick with unsweetened beverages.",
          "description":"It's not only the food choices at fast food restaurants that make meals unhealthy. What you choose to drink also plays an important role in the overall nutrient content of your breakfast. Sweetened beverages, when consumed regularly or in large quantities, can lead to weight gain, heart disease and diabetes. Skip items like:  sweetened coffee drinks, sweet tea, fruit juice cocktails, smoothies and sodas. Stick to water or coffee and tea without sweeteners. These are naturally no calorie and do not contain any sugar."

          "headline":"Choose a small and skip the \"up-size\" option.",
          "description":"There's no doubt that one of the best ways to keep fast food meals in check is by ordering a small. Skip those bigger portions or the \"up-sized\" version to keep your meals in check. Many fast food restaurants offer you the option of increasing your meal and drink size for just just a few pennies. Resist this urge. With every size increase, there's also a significant increase in calories and fat. Also, try ordering a small. Not only is this size a little cheaper in price, but also comes with fewer overall calories. Also choose smaller meals in general. For example, instead of the double or triple burger patty, just go for a single patty instead. If you want to order a whole meal (with a sandwich, fries and a drink) consider going for a kid's meal. You get everything included but a very small amount and it's portion controlled."

When you spend time thoroughly reviewing the menu, you'll be able to see every option available. Many times, if you're just order your \"usual\" you may be missing the opportunity to find other options that are more nutritious. Also make sure you find a complete menu. The one you see behind the registers or at the drive-thru may not give you every option. Ask for a paper menu or check online. Scan the entire menu for options that are more nutritious.

Many restaurants now give the nutrition information and this is something you should check out. Once you've reviewed the menu and have picked a few things to consider, take a look at the nutrition information to see if they're truly going to fit into your diet plan.

Eating fast food on a more regular basis isn't a great option. Although there are some healthy options at fast food restaurants, it's best to include some home cooked meals. When you make more foods from home, you have increased control on the total fat, sugar, sodium and even calories your foods contain. This can help you stick to a healthier diet overall. Set a few days a week to have breakfast at home. That way, you can balance your diet a little bit easier."

You'll be pleasantly surprised how tasty this nutritious item is. Many fast food restaurants are now offering oatmeal as a breakfast option; however, things can get pretty high in calories with all the sugar and other toppings they may add. McDonald's fruit and maple oatmeal is a great choice. It's made with whole grain rolled oats and topped with your choice of diced apples, dried fruit and brown sugar. This oatmeal, with the brown sugar, is only 290 calories per serving. If you skip the brown sugar, it'll knock the calorie count down to 260 calories per serving.

They're lower in calories and are a great option to start your day with. Although the donuts at this restaurant are delicious, they can rack up both calories and sugar quickly. These sweet treats can cost you 300 \u2013 400 calories just for one. Instead, order yourself a egg white and turkey sausage wrap. You can get the egg white with vegetables (an extra hit of fiber! ), plus it comes with a high protein meat and cheese. One of these wraps will be about 150 calories total.

Many of McDonald's breakfast sandwiches are overly high in calories since they have a ton of high fat breakfast meat or are served on high calorie items like bagels or croissants. The Egg McMuffin is a pretty simple breakfast sandwich. It's an English muffin (smeared with a little butter), scrambled egg, Canadian bacon and cheese. This tasty sandwich is about 300 calories total; however, if you ask them to hold the butter, you'll save yourself 30 calories. In addition, you'll get about 17 g of protein and 2 g of fiber."

Instead, consider ordering Jamba Juice's mango peach topper. It's sweet, smooth and creamy, plus it contains your whole day's worth of fruit servings. This smoothie is about 320 calories total.
