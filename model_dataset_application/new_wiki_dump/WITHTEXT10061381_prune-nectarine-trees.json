Pruning vertical branches helps to encourage vegetative growth, pruning horizontal ones helps to encourage fruiting growth.Leave small horizontal branches intact for future fruiting growth, but cut longer ones to prevent short-term fruiting. Focus on pruning higher branches to evenly distribute sunlight to lower ones. Don\u2019t prune branches in the spring or summer.
