          "description":"Chew softer foods such as berries, fruit, or cooked vegetables at least 5 times so your saliva and digestive enzymes can mix with your food to aid in digestion. Focus on chewing all of the food in your mouth to help form a bolus, which is a round mass of food that makes swallowing safer and easier.Some fruits, like watermelon, may only take 4-5 chews before it\u2019s broken down enough to be easily digested. Avoid taking 1-2 bites and then swallowing your food or it won\u2019t be properly digested, and you can experience gas, bloating, and intestinal discomfort."

          "description":"Count each of your bites as you chew tougher or crunchier foods such as cooked meat and vegetables like celery, radishes, or carrots to help break them down into more easily digestible pieces. Some foods may not need to be chewed as many times before they\u2019re broken down enough to be swallowed easily, but aim for 30 chews.Take your time and count each of your chews to help slow yourself down and chew your food properly. Food for Thought\nChewing tougher foods properly will help you absorb more of the nutrients from them, allow you to taste more of the flavors, and make you feel fuller for longer, which can help you maintain a healthy weight."

Avoid using quick, choppy bites, which won\u2019t properly grind up your food.Eating more slowly also gives your stomach time to signal to your brain that you\u2019re full, which will help you avoid overeating."

Avoid swallowing hard or tough pieces of food whole to reduce digestive issues.Your molars are designed to help you chew up tougher foods, so use them!"

Try drinking a glass of water or a beverage about an hour before your meal so you don\u2019t get thirsty when you\u2019re eating.Drinking while you eat will dilute the acid in your stomach and flush the food through before it\u2019s had a chance to be properly digested, which can cause gas, bloating, and intestinal discomfort.
