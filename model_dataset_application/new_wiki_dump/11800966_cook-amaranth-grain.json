          "description":"Use the smaller amount of water if you want your cooked amaranth to have a sticky, porridge-like consistency. Choose the larger amount if you prefer your cooked amaranth to have more of a rice-like consistency.Both options are for 1 c\u2014or about 7 oz (200 g)\u2014of amaranth seeds. This works out to roughly a 3:1 or 6:1 water-to-amaranth ratio. For the best results, use a heavy-bottomed pot with a tight-fitting lid. You\u2019ll get better heat distribution and more even cooking. No matter which amount of water you use, the cooked amaranth seeds will be creamy on the inside while still being firm enough on the outside to \u201cburst\u201d in your mouth when you bite into them."
