      "description":"LA is a huge city. Especially in a city as large as Los Angeles, your apartment\u2019s proximity to your work or school needs to be taken into consideration. Assessing the amount of time you will regularly sit in traffic on your daily commute to and from work or school (or wherever you plan to go regularly) should be calculated. A good way of determining if a location is good for you is by doing a \u201ctrial run\u201d, by simulating your commute. Drive from your prospective apartment to work as you would as if you had already moved in. Make sure to simulate the situation as realistically as possible; driving at 8:45 AM is a completely different scenario than driving two hours later. This test-drive will give you a realistic idea of what your daily commute will be like, and how bearable or unbearable it will be. Everyone puts a different value on their time. For some, it may make more sense to live closer to work, at the expense of higher monthly rent. For others, it is sensible to have a long commute and spend less money on rent every month. Paying more money for closer proximity to work, in order to avoid traffic is a clear illustration of the popular saying that \u201creal estate is based on three things: location, location, location.\u201d"
