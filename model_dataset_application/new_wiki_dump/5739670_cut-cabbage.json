Slice the cabbage through the outer leaves to the center. Cut in \u00bc to \u00bd\" (6 to 12 mm) slices for stews, or shred to \u215b\" (3 mm) thickness for sauerkraut or slaw. You can also shred with a mandoline slicer, a grater with large holes, or a food processor's grating disk. Mandoline blades can be dangerous to inexperienced users, so select a model with a hand guard. You can slice across the wedge for short slices, or along the wedge for longer ones. Either way is fine for any recipe."
