If you don't have a wine cooler, you can chill your gew\u00fcrztraminer in the refrigerator. Check the temperature using a wine bottle thermometer. If you don't have a wine bottle thermometer, leave the gew\u00fcrztraminer in your refrigerator overnight. It may not be at the perfect temperature but it will be sufficiently chilled. If your gew\u00fcrztraminer is acidic, chill it two degrees more. If it's less acidic, chill it two degrees less."

This will let the wine aerate and improve the flavor. Use a decanter to pour the wine if you want to improve the flavor of a cheaper gew\u00fcrztraminer. Twist the bottle as you pull it away from the glass to prevent wine from dripping after you pour."

Gewurztraminer wine will range from dark yellow to copper colored. If it's too pale, it's a low quality wine. This wine should have a very strong lychee, rose, and spiced smell.

If you prefer a dessert wine, choose a medium or sweet gew\u00fcrztraminer. Keep in mind that gew\u00fcrztraminers in general are considered sweet wines because of their floral aromas. A wine with a complex floral aroma often tastes sweeter than it actually is, even if there isn't any sugar in the wine."
