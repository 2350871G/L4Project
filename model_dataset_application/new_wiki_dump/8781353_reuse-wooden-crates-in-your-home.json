They don\u2019t have to be stacked perfectly, in fact offsetting them a bit will give the nightstand a better look. You can stain or paint the wooden crates to better fit with your decor.

All you\u2019ll need are a few crates and a board, ideally made of plywood. Stack crates up to your desired height at either end. Use nails or screws to secure each stack of crates together, then place your plywood board atop them. You can use mending plates to secure the crates together if you\u2019re worried about the wood splitting."

If the bottom of your crate is completely solid, you can drill holes in it, then cover the bottom with a piece of burlap. This will let water go through, but keep the soil in the crate."
