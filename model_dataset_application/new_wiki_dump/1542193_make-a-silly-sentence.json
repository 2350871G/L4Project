If your students are more advanced, you can add additional sentence components like adverbs or possessive pronouns. Color-code each category of cards differently, to make it easier for the students. For example:\nFor beginning grammar students, just write predicates in orange, like jumped on the table; laughed; drew a picture; and flew to the moon. For intermediate classes, add adverbs (quickly; happily; loudly), and/or adjectives (silly; red; big). For more advanced classes, break the predicate into verb phrases, and a second stack of noun cards."

You can also try writing a whole \"silly story\" with your friends, where each person writes one sentence. Teaching Sentence Structure with Silly Sentences Write sentence subjects on large pieces of paper. You can use markers to write these nouns yourself, or use a computer to type them in an extra-large font size, then print them. Choose a color to write the subjects in, such as blue. Cut the paper so each noun is on its own section. For example, write The clown; The dog; The president; The tiger; and Ms. Smith. Make sure the nouns are either all singular or all plural, so they can all be used with the same verb forms. Make color-coded cards for other parts of speech. The most basic sentence structure lesson can just use subjects (nouns) and predicates (verb phrases).

For example, The clown jumped on the table. is a good silly sentence, since the subject and predicate are in the right order. Check on your students' work. This can be an activity students do in small groups of 3\u20135, or individually whenever they have play time or individual work time. Have them leave out their sentences for you to check on. Praise the students when they get a sentence right, and help them understand the right order if they make a mistake. If a student loves a sentence he wrote, or if he needs encouragement, you can save his silly sentence on a board for all the students to read and have fun with. Help students out.

Print these out and bring them to class, so the students can make more silly sentences using their favorite words. Teaching Sounds with Silly Sentences Pick a letter the student is having trouble with. This kind of silly sentence is great for students who are learning how to read, especially if they are having trouble understanding phonics, or teaching reading by connecting written letters to sounds. Pick one letter at a time, such as \"P.\" Write or find sentences that focus on this letter. Write a sentence that uses the letter many times, using clear handwriting or typing. Make sure the letter is pronounced the same each time it shows up, or the student could get confused. It can be especially helpful to use words that begin with the letter. For example, write \"Pigs play in parks and pamper Penelope with nail polish.\" Search online for \"silly phonics sentences\" for examples, such as this free example. Make a large image of the letter. Draw the letter you've chosen (P in our example) on a large piece of paper, but keep it small enough that the student could sit next to it and trace over it without standing up. Add texture to the letter. The student may learn better if there is a texture to associate with the letter. You can use dried-on white glue, glued-on sand, or any other material. Rough materials are best, since they will force the student to use more effort and movement when tracing, helping the student's memory. If you plan to make a silly sentence for several different letters, try using a material that begins with that letter. For example, glue pepper (black peppercorns) onto the P, and sand onto the S.
