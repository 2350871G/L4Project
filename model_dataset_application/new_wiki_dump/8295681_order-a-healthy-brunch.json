          "description":"Ask for one or two poached eggs. If you order one egg, you will get 75 calories including 7 grams of protein, 5 grams of fat, and 1.6 grams of saturated fat, alongside iron, vitamins, and minerals. Eggs also contain carotenoids, which may reduce the risk of age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in older adults. Two poached eggs will add up to 150 calories.

From the plum tomato, you should get about 11 calories, including 2 grams of carbohydrates, 1 gram of protein, ten percent of your vitamin A requirement and thirteen percent of your vitamin C requirement. From the toast, you will get about 65 calories, including 2.5 grams of protein, 13.6 grams of carbohydrates, and half a gram of fat. If you order poached eggs, brown toast and a plum tomato, you will be consuming 150-225 calories, depending on whether you order one or two eggs.
