      "description":"Let him/her choose some which are comfortable and appropriate for where you are going. For example, don't pack short clothes when going to Greenland. Make sure you pack enough for the holiday. If you're going for a short vacation, choose pajamas, pants, shirts, and socks. Vary your choices with your knowledge of the weather. Like if it's cold outside, you're not going to pack a t-shirt, you would pack a coat and a sweater, and so on. But do pack a mixture of T-shirts and sweaters, just incase the weather changes suddenly!"
