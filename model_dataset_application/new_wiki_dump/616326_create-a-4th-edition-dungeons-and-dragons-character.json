      "headline":"Determine your ability scores.",
      "description":"Ability scores are the base statistics for your character and can be determined with one of three methods. Note that each class depends on certain ability scores, which typically means that you should assign higher scores to these abilities. The first method uses a standard array of scores. Assign the following numbers to each ability score any way you like: 16, 14, 13, 12, 11, and 10. The second method is a little more complicated. Start with the following scores: 8, 10, 10, 10, 10, and 10. You have 22 \"points\" to spend in order to increase the ability scores. Use the following rules to spend these points and improve your ability scores, then assign the score to the specific abilities. Improving the numbers 8-12 costs one point. As such, increasing the \"8\" to a \"12\" would cost 4 points. Improving a \"10\" to a \"13\" would cost only 3: one point each for 10-to-11, 11-to-12, and 12-to-13. Improving the numbers 13-15 costs two points. As such, increasing the \"12\" from before would cost another point to become a \"13\", but an additional two points to improve to a \"14\". Similarly, improving the \"13\" to a \"16\" would cost 6 points: two each for 13-to-14, 14-to-15, and 15-to-16. Improving a \"16\" to a \"17\" costs another three points. Improving a \"17\" to an \"18\" costs another four points. As a result, upgrading a \"10\" to an \"18\" would cost a total of 16 points = 3*1 + 3*2 + 3 + 4. The third method uses randomly-generated numbers and provides the most versatile and volatile scores. For each ability score, roll 4 6-sided dice (4d6). Add the three highest numbers, ignore the lowest, and assign the sum as an ability score."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Once the ability scores have been generated and assigned, look up your character's race and determine if it has any ability score modifiers.",
      "description":"Add or subtract these from the base stats. Once the base stats have been assigned after racial adjustments, assign each score an ability modifier, with either a plus or minus sign next to the base stat followed by the number. The table shows the ability modifiers:\nAd infinitum. At first level, 8 should be the lowest ability score and 18 the highest. Average scores are considered between 12-16."

      "description":"Next to each skill ability, write down the skill points you currently have. Each skill point is equal to one-half of your level plus your ability score modifier and +5 if you are trained in that skill. As an example, say you are playing a 1st-level human rogue with the following ability scores:\nstr 11 +0\ncon 10 +0\ndex 16 +3\nint 12 +1\nwis 8  -1\ncha 14 +2\nA rogue is automatically trained in Thievery and Stealth, meaning he or she gets an automatic +5 points for both of those skills. They can also choose four of the following skills to be trained in:\nAcrobatics, Athletics, Bluff, Dungeoneering, Insight, Intimidate, Perception, and Streetwise. As an example, Acrobatics, Bluff, Perception, and Streetwise were chosen to be trained skills. This means that the rogue currently has six skills he or she is trained in and has a permanent +5 bonus to. Since Acrobatics is a dexterity-based skill, the dexterity modifier of the rogue is added to the score, which is +3 in this case. Acrobatics is now equal to 8 total skill points."
