Whisk until all the ingredients are incorporated and you have a smooth icing. Assembling Multiple Cake Layers Cut your cake. If you made a single round cake or Bundt cake and want to make a layer cake, take a sharp knife and cut the cake in half to separate the top and bottom into two layers. If you baked more than one cake and are going to layer them, don\u2019t cut them in half. Chill the layers. Place the cakes in the refrigerator for about an hour before frosting it. This will make the cake stiffer, less delicate, and easier to work with. Frost the top of the bottom layer. Place the bottom layer of cake on a cake plate. With a frosting knife or icing spatula (or a regular butter knife), spread a thin layer of icing on top of the first layer of cake. Refrigerate for 15 minutes before proceeding. If you want to add an extra element to your cake, consider adding a layer of fruit, jam, custard, or ganache on top of the icing. Raspberry, strawberry, and cherry are traditional fruit or jam choices to pair with cake. Add the second cake layer and frost. Carefully place the second layer of cake back on top of the first layer. With your frosting knife, apply a thin layer of frosting to the entire cake. This is called the crumb coat, and it will keep the final decorative layer of frosting clean and crumb free. If you made a Bundt cake, don\u2019t forget to frost the inner well along with the outside of the cake. Refrigerate the cake for 20 to 30 minutes before applying the final layer of frosting. If you are using a glaze, drizzle glaze evenly over the top of the cake one spoonful at a time. Allow the glaze to drip down over the sides of the cake. Add the final layer of frosting. Apply a thicker and even layer of frosting over the entire crumb coat. Use the back of the spatula or knife to even out the frosting and make the surface as smooth as possible. For an added touch, sprinkle the top with fruit, coconut flakes, cocoa powder, or citrus zest. Serve immediately, or cover with a lid until you're ready to eat. Finished. ",
