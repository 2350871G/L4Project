A threaded caster has a screw that screws into the chair, while a grip stem pulls out like a plug from a socket. If your chair has a swivel plate, measure the width of the plate itself.

Installing New Casters Screw in a threaded caster with your hands until it no longer turns. If your casters are threaded, align the threaded stem with chair's leg and screw it in until it stops turning. Push in a grip caster. For a grip caster (with a stem that is not threaded), push the caster's stem into the chair leg until the top of the caster is flush with the bottom of the chair leg.
