Rhubarb is fairly hard, so you can also use a vegetable brush to scrub it clean if you like. Lay the stalks on a clean towel and roll each stalk around to dry it. You can also dry the rhubarb in a salad spinner if you have one."

Smaller pieces are ideal for jams, pie fillings, and baked goods. Larger pieces are better for eating plain or making chunkier compotes. If you have specific plans for the rhubarb, consult the individual recipes to determine the right length for the pieces."
