You melt brass by putting it in a furnace in an iron pan, but it's a complicated process. Learn how to melt brass before you attempt to cast anything. To melt brass, you'll need a metal melting furnace and brass items to melt. You also will need a crucible, which is the piece of equipment that holds the melted brass in the furnace, and a skimmer spoon which is used to transport the material. Put your crucible in your furnace following the instructions of your particular furnace model, light your furnace, and then start to fill your crucible with brass after fifteen minutes or so. Keep the furnace going until your brass has completely melted. Once you start to see discolored material on top of the molten brass then you'll know your brass has melted. Remove the discolored material using your skimmer spoon and discard it in a box of sand or a heat safe trash can."

          "description":"Make sure you make the pattern .017 inches (0.0432 cm) larger than the finished casting to allow room for the molten brass. Brass gets smaller as it becomes a solid. Styrofoam is a popular option for making your pattern, or you can use wood if you would rather stick with the classic technique. Essentially what you'll be doing is breaking up a three dimensional object into shapes that will be pressed into sand. The void in the sand will form the solid cast. You can make any shapes that you'd like as long as it can withstand being shoved into a box of sand. You're making a three dimensional prototype of whatever it is that you want to cast. If you want to make basic shapes like a simple doorknob, you can design the prototype on your own using some sort of clay or the materials named above. Whittling a block of wood is always a good option too. Otherwise, if you want a more complex pattern, you'll need to buy it. Oftentimes these patterns are made by experienced metalworkers."
