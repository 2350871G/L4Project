Take the mouth pattern and lay it over your cardboard piece. Then, use your marker to trace the mouth shape onto the cardboard. Next, cut along the marker lines to create your cardboard mouth piece.

Make sure that you press the sock into the edges and hold for a second. Cut out the red foam mouth piece. After you have finished creating a border around the cardboard piece, take the mouth pattern and lay it over the red craft foam. Use the marker to trace around the edges of the pattern and then cut it out. Glue the red foam mouth piece over the cardboard. Lay the red foam mouth piece over the cardboard piece. Then, apply glue to the back of the red foam mouth piece and secure it to the cardboard piece. Make sure that any remaining marker is facing down. Check the position of the red foam mouth piece before you attach it to the cardboard piece. Create the tongue piece. Use the tongue pattern to trace the tongue piece over the black craft foam. Then, cut out the tongue piece. It should look like a black heart when you are done. Position the tongue piece over the lower portion of the mouth piece.

The flat sides of the eye pieces should be facing each other. The eyes should also be placed close together so that the fuzzy sock borders are touching. Adding the Nose, Ears, Whiskers, and Teeth Give your puppet a nose. Use a dot of hot glue to glue the pompom to the center of the sock\u2019s toe area. This will be the puppet\u2019s nose. The pompom should be positioned on the opposite of the mouth side and just a little below the eyes. Create the ears. Use the ear pattern and your marker to trace the ears onto the green craft foam.
