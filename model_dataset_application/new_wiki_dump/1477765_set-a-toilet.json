  "text":" Preparing the Toilet Location Determine what model of toilet you wish to install, and purchase it from your local hardware or appliance store.  Block the soil pipe with a rag or other cloth. This is the main pipe coming out of the floor that your toilet will eventually sit on top of. Verify that the hole in the floor that the pipe comes out of is wide enough to fit the closet flange. Place the flange over the pipe to determine if it will fit in the hole up to the collar. If the fit is too tight, you will need to use a jigsaw to cut the floor around the pipe. Measure the gap between the flange collar's bottom and the floor. Remove the soil pipe from the hole, and use a handsaw to cut the pipe to the exact measurement of the gap. File the cut end of the pipe with a PVC file or utility knife. Install the Toilet Apply PVC primer and cement on the inner surface of the closet bend and to the outside of an end of the soil pipe. Twist these pieces together to seal the connection. Coat the other end of the soil pipe. First coat the inside of the closet flange with PVC primer and then cement. Screw these together, and press downward into the hole until the collar is flush against the floor. Turn the fitting until the slots are on the right and left sides of the hole, and fasten it to the floor using stainless steel screws. For best results use an electric drill to tighten the connections. Turn off the water supply to the bathroom through the valve on the wall. Place a small bucket underneath the supply line, and use a tubing cutter to slice the pipe, but leave 1 inch (2.54 cm) free for the stop valve connection. Drain the water from the pipe completely. Detach the stop valve's handle and stem. Clean and dry the pipe thoroughly with a wire-brush pipe cleaner, and coat liberally with flux. Solder the stop valve and the supply line together around the joint. You may need to use a propane torch to heat the connection enough to melt the metal. Attach the closet bolts that should be included with your new toilet. These should be installed with the threaded ends up into the flange collar slots. Place a brass washer over each bolt, and then press a wax ring down over the flange. The flat side of the wax should be resting on the floor. Place your new toilet bowl over the flange, align the holes in the base over the bolts, and lower the bowl on to the wax ring. Press it down until the toilet is flush with the floor. Install nylon washers over both closet bolts, and alternate sides while tightening the connections with a wrench so that the bowl ends up even. Stop tightening when you encounter resistance. Cut the closet bolts with a hacksaw approximately 2 threads above the nut, and place the plastic bolt covers that came with the toilet over the nut. Snap into place. Attach the toilet tank to the bolts on the back of the toilet bowl, and alternate tightening nuts on to the bolts until the tank is secure. Connect the chain to the tank's handle. Install the supply line to the stop valve outlet and the tank's supply fitting. Use a compression ring to secure the connection. Tighten the ring's nut with your wrench. Turn the water supply back on, and let the toilet fill. Check the toilet fitting for leaks.",
