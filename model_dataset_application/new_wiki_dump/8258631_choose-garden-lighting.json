They're also easy to install because they have stakes built in, so you can just push or hammer them into the ground as needed. Lighted paths make it easier to get around outside at night. Solar-powered lights work well to illuminate pathways because you don't need a cord that could trip people up. A good option is solar-powered stake lights, which have a solar panel on each light. You should use more solar-powered lights than you would use if you were using electric lights, as they aren't quite as bright."

They make it easier for people to get around without tripping, much like pathway lights, plus they help people see any obstacles in the way. Just make sure you choose lights that are bright enough to illuminate the area. You could use something decorative and practical, such as a string of lantern lights."

However, adding lights to all stairs is a good idea, to help keep people from tripping and falling. Try using stake lights, mini spotlights, or even rope lights over stairs."

These lights can be both decorative and practical, as they help to keep crime at bay. Make sure to think about your neighbors when placing your lights.

You can choose ones that are motion-activated, so they light up when anyone walks by. You can also install ones that are set to come on at dusk and turn off in the morning, thereby automatically lighting up the area through the night. To keep your energy bill low, use LED or other low-energy lights."

Plus, they tend to wear out quicker. Electric lights, on the other hand, tend to be more reliable. They will provide lighting as long as they have working light bulbs and you have power."

Of course, these should never be pointed so they'd shine in someone's eyes. Rather, these lights should be pointed upward or downward at an angle, away from where people will be.
