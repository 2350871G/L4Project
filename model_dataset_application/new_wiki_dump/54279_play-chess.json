Games may also end in a draw if neither player can force a checkmate, such as if the kings are the only pieces left on the board. Using Special Moves Capture with pawns using the \"en passant\" rule. En passant, meaning \"in passing\" in French, is when one pawn captures another pawn after its starting move. You can only do en passant if your opponent has moved a pawn 2 squares forward from its starting position so it\u2019s next to one of your pawns.

You cannot wait to do it on any other turn after. Promote a pawn to a queen by getting it across the board. If you move a pawn to the back row on your opponent\u2019s side of the board, it immediately gets promoted to a queen or to any piece. It doesn\u2019t matter if your queen has already been captured when you promote your pawn. Thus, you could have multiple queens on the board at a time. To indicate pawn promotion in chess notation, write the square where the pawn is promoted. Then write an equals sign followed by a Q to symbolize it\u2019s now a queen. For example, you may write c8=Q. Even though a pawn can theoretically be promoted to any piece, the only situation where you would not want to promote your pawn to a queen is if doing so results in a stalemate, causing the game to end in a draw. Protect your king by castling. Once during the game, you may choose to make a special move known as castling. To castle, move your king two squares horizontally toward either rook. Then on the same move, move the rook to the square immediately on the other side of the king. You cannot castle if your king was in check during the previous move, or if it would be in check after the move. You also cannot castle through any squares that are under attack by enemy pieces.Tip: You can only castle if you haven\u2019t moved your king and rook yet during the game and if the spaces between them are empty. Developing Winning Strategies Learn the relative value of each piece. Each piece in a game of chess is valued differently depending on how powerful it is. Queens are the most powerful piece and are worth 9 points. Rooks are worth 5 points, bishops and knights are worth 3, and pawns are worth 1 point. Try to protect your more powerful pieces so you can use them later in the game. The king's value is undefined as it cannot be captured. Compare the total value of all the pieces still on the board for each player to determine who has a material advantage. Point assessment is also useful when considering possible captures. For example, using pieces with a lower value to capture pieces with a higher value gives you more of an advantage. Protect your pieces. Every time your opponent makes a move, take some time to scan the board. Move pieces out of the way if your opponent is going to capture them next turn. Try catching the piece that\u2019s threatening your piece or move one of your pieces to threaten a strong piece your opponent has. It's okay to give up a piece in order to draw your opponent into a trap where you'll capture an even more valuable piece. Try to think several moves ahead to anticipate and counteract your opponent\u2019s moves and stop any plans they\u2019re making. Aim to control the center of the board. Pieces near the center are at their most powerful since they have the most mobility and control. This forces your opponent to the sides of the board where they have fewer moves to choose from. Controlling the center helps you play more offensive and your opponent defensive. Tip: Keep 1 or 2 pawns in the center of the board so you can still use your stronger pieces to attack.",
