          "description":"Use 2 tablespoons (about 16-18 grams) of flour and .25 cups (59 mL) of water for every 1 cup (240 mL) of sauce. Mix the water and flour carefully, making sure that there are no lumps. Be sure to use cold water, since warm or hot water will cause the flour to clump together. If you want a thicker sauce, add a little more flour. Use less flour for a thinner sauce."

Keep stirring as the sauce continues to cook to prevent burning. The sauce will thicken a little more after it cools, so aim for getting it just shy of how thick you want it. You may need to experiment a bit to achieve the texture you want."

          "description":"Keep checking the sauce as it cooks to see if it has achieved the desired thickness. After that, give it an additional minute to cook before taking it off the heat. This will give the flour time to cook thoroughly so that your sauce doesn\u2019t have a strong raw flour flavor. Allowing the sauce to reach a full boil after adding the slurry can also help cook off the flour flavor. Take care not to let your sauce burn, however!"

Cook for 3-5 minutes for a light roux, which is good for sauces like bechamel or white gravy. A light roux should be cooked enough to lose the characteristic raw flour taste and smell, but not long enough that it begins to brown. For brown roux, cook for 6-7 minutes. This is an ideal roux for brown gravy. If you want dark roux, let your mixture cook for 8-15 minutes. This is a good option for Cajun and Creole sauces."

You can use it once it is warm to the touch (as opposed to hot) or even refrigerate it and use it cold. If you add the roux to a cooler sauce while it is still bubbling hot, it will break apart and form clumps. As a general rule, it\u2019s best to combine roux and the rest of your sauce when they are at similar temperatures. For example, if haven\u2019t started heating your sauce yet, add the roux while both are cold or lukewarm."
