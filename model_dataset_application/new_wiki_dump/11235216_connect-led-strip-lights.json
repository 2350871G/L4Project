          "description":"Whether you\u2019re using the LED lights to border a room, light up a vanity, or decorate a window, you\u2019ll need to measure the perimeter of where you plan to place them to know how long of a strand to purchase. Use a measuring tape to measure your intended lit space, writing down the measurements so you don\u2019t forget them. For example, if you\u2019re putting the light strip along the perimeter of a room that has 4 walls that are 12 ft (3.7 m) in width, you would need a strip of lights that\u2019s at least 48 ft (15 m) long. It\u2019s best to purchase a light strip that\u2019s a little bit longer than you need instead of one that ends up being a little too short."

Use a measuring tape to find the right spot, marking it with a piece of painter\u2019s tape or a marker so you don\u2019t forget where to cut the strip. You\u2019ll likely need to spread the light strip out to measure it accurately if you\u2019re not using the entire strand."

Your LED light strip will have markings along the strip telling you where you\u2019re allowed to cut, often marked by orange or brown dots, or even a small picture of scissors. If your desired measurement doesn\u2019t perfectly line up with marked cutting spots, you\u2019ll still need to cut along the designated lines to ensure your lights work. The distance between the cut points will differ depending on the length of your light strip that you purchased. If your LED lights are super close together on the strip, you\u2019ll likely have many more cut points available, while LED lights that are spread farther apart will have fewer cut points."

If your lights are spread far apart, you may also use wire cutters, being careful not to damage the lights. Be careful to only cut along the cut point, as cutting too close to the LED lights will prevent them from working."
