Although green, red, yellow, and orange are the most common colors, gardeners also have the option of growing dark brown and purple pepper varieties. Some fast ripening varieties can produce fruit in as little as two months but others may need over three months before they begin to flower."

Seeds that are slow to sprout may benefit from the use of heating mats. Gardeners should note that the plants will not sprout at all if temperatures are below 55\u00b0 Fahrenheit (12.7\u00b0 C)."
