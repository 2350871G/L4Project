          "description":"Expect a lower amount of sugar to affect not only the taste, but the texture of baked goods as well. While you may be eager to cut back on sweetness, be conservative with how much sugar you leave out at first. Each time you bake a particular item, cut the recipe\u2019s sugar by only a tenth. Then cut an additional tenth from the original amount the next time and compare the results. Continue cutting the sugar by tenths and testing each batch for both taste and texture. Once you make a batch where either one feels off, you\u2019ll know you left out too much sugar. To find the perfect amount to use sooner, you could also make several test batches all at once, each with a different percentage of the recommended sugar content."

Instead of cutting back by small increments, start by adding only a fraction of the recommended sugar at a time to your filling. Mix it in with the other ingredients, and then taste-test. Continue adding small increments (again, say a tenth of the recommended amount) until it\u2019s just the right amount of sweet. This works best when the filling contains other ingredients that are naturally sweet, like fruits. However, bear in mind that fruits with tart skins and/or bitter seeds will taste more sour after they\u2019re baked."

With this in mind:\nMonkeying with sugar-based recipes on your own may require a lot of trial and error. Baked goods that utilize sugar for more than just taste may be drastically affected in terms of texture and moistness.
