You can also trim off and discard any large pieces of stem that have no needles. Rosemary stems are flavorful, but they're woody, tough, and not pleasant to eat."

          "description":"Full sprigs of rosemary are great for finishing, garnishing, and adding flavor to certain dishes. You can either add the sprigs after cooking to finish a dish, or you can cook roasts, soups, and other meals with full sprigs of rosemary. Like bay leaves, rosemary sprigs that are cooked with foods are typically removed before serving."

Apply gentle pressure and slide your fingers down the stem to strip off the needles. Transfer the needles to a cutting board and discard the stems. Instead of discarding the stems, you can also hang it up to dry and store it to use as a skewer for vegetables and meat that you want to barbecue. When you want to include rosemary right in your recipes, it\u2019s best to use the individual needles rather than the full sprig."
