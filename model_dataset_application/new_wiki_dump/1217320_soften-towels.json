Furthermore, hot water can help dissolve oils that are left over from hygiene products and skin. Be aware that brightly-colored towels may fade with repeated hot-water washing. If you don't care about fading, then proceed to wash with hot water. If you want to retain the color, then wash with cold water and try other towel-softening techniques."

Use the extra rinse cycle when you machine-wash your towels, and use a half-cup of white vinegar instead of soap in the first cycle. The vinegar will remove the oils and soapy residue that toughen up your towel, making it fluffier and more absorbent. Use a light soap (or just water) in the second rinse cycle to rinse out the smell of vinegar but retain the soft finish."

Try partially drying towels on the line, then finishing them up in the dryer for extra warmth and fluff. After drying, put the towel in for another round \u2013 but select the wrinkle-free option, if available. This will fluff the towel, which should help soften the fabric."
