If your bed looks tidy, the rest of your room will as well. Make a conscious effort to make your bed each morning after waking up. A good way to launch this habit is by completing it first thing. Before heading to the shower or the kitchen, for example, simply straighten the sheets and blankets right away. Making the bed really only takes a minute or so, but if time is still an issue, pull the blanket right over your pillows to at least give the illusion of tidiness. You can skip tucking in the corners and such if you're pressed for time. Try buying bedding you love, with throw pillows in colors or patterns that you love. Creating a fun, aesthetically pleasing bed will give you incentive to make it in the morning."

          "description":"Before bed at night, you may quickly undress in your room and then slip on pajamas. To keep things neat, try to hang anything that can be worn again. If it can\u2019t, drop it right into the hamper. If you don't already have a hamper or laundry basket in your room, it's a good idea to move one into the bedroom. You're more likely to remember to toss dirty clothing in the hamper if it's sitting right next to you as a reminder. If you don\u2019t have the space to hang more items, folding works just as well. Neatly fold all items and store in a designated space like a drawer or closet shelf. Buy a hamper that closes and isn\u2019t see-through so that your dirty laundry isn\u2019t in plain sight. Choosing a hamper that\u2019s interesting or well-designed might even make you more inclined to throw your clothes in it."

You can use a broom with microfiber cloths, allowing you to simply run the broom across the floor to clean up excess dirt. You should also strive to remove any dust from places like the bedpost, drawers, and bookshelves. To make things easier for yourself, keep a dust rag or brush in your room so you'll remember to periodically dust when you have the chance.

Sometime before brushing your teeth and slipping into your pajamas, do a quick 15 minute clean of your bedroom. Pick up any items off the floor, like clothing or books. Put them in their proper space. If a surface is looking dusty, quickly dust it off. You can also do a quick sweep before bed if there's any dirt or debris on your floor. It may also help to set out the clothing you'll be wearing tomorrow. This way, you'll make less mess in the morning when getting ready to head out the door. You may find you'll fall asleep better when you start cleaning before bed. You may feel more settled and relaxed going to bed in a freshly cleaned room. Resist the urge to just push everything onto the floor or the dresser. If you don\u2019t clean it up at that moment, you have a lower chance of getting to it in the future."

Closets can become messy and cluttered quickly, as you often neglect to clean space you cannot directly see. Floor spaces blocked by your bed and other furniture also get messy. Open up the closet and look for any clutter. Some clothing may have fallen off the hanger. You may have tucked an unwanted item in the closet temporarily. Put these items in their proper place. Vacuum or sweep the closet floor and dust off the shelves. Clean under furniture. Move your bed, desk, and any other furniture aside. Retrieve any items that were caught under these pieces of furniture and put them away. Then, vacuum or sweep the floor space. Wipe down your baseboards as well, as they can easily trap dust and dirt."

If you read in your room, put the book back on your shelf when you're done. If you had a snack in your room, put the dishes back in the kitchen when you finish eating.

Put formal clothing in the back, and every day clothing and sleep wear towards the middle. It may help to divide your bedroom into different sections.

You can fold and store extra linens in a wicker basket and position it near the foot of your bed. You can also use cute, decorative boxes that you can purchase at a craft store. You can store mementos, like old photographs, in such boxes. You can also keep supplies that do not fit in your desk drawers, like pens and papers, in a box that you can tuck under your desk.
