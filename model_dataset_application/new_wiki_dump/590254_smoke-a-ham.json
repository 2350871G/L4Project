Here, the liquid penetrates the meat and keeps it moist. Meanwhile, the salt and sodium nitrite in the liquid brine cure the meat, halting harmful bacteria and turning the meat slightly pink. In one gallon of water, bring the following ingredients to a boil and then allow brine to cool completely:\n2 cups brown sugar\n1 and 1/2 cups kosher salt\n1/2 cup of pickling spice\n8 teaspoons of pink salt (not to be confused with sodium nitrite). Pink salt is a mixture of salt and sodium nitrite. It is colored pink so it's not confused with regular table salt. If you were to use 8 teaspoons of sodium nitrite in this recipe, the result could be harmful."

          "description":"You don't have to use a brining bag for brining, but it makes your job a lot easier. A brining bag will easily fit your ham, zip up for a cleaner brine, and minimize the cleanup time after you're done. If you don't have a brining bag, you can always use a clean (clean is especially important!) watercooler or container that's taller than the tallest point of the ham. If you are using a container or cooler to brine your ham in, be sure to sterilize it beforehand with boiling water. The smallest contamination could cause off-flavors in your final dish. If you're using a container or cooler instead of a brining bag, find something clean to weight the ham down with. You want all parts of the meat exposed to the brine."

Periodically, remove the ham from the refrigerator and inject it with the brining liquid. Use a marinade injector for this. You only have to do this once or twice, at several locations in the ham. Injecting the brine into the meat of the ham will make sure that the curing salts penetrate the deepest parts of the ham. When you're injecting the ham with the brine, take a little bit of time to inspect it. It shouldn't be giving off any strange odors, nor should there be any scum on the brining liquid."
