Gather the nuts when they\u2019re green to ensure that the nutmeat is still fresh and not too bitter or rancid-tasting. The nuts will have a yellowish-green color when they\u2019re mature.

However, it\u2019s often easiest to gather nuts that have already fallen. Make sure to gather fallen nuts quickly, before they have a chance to develop mold or be eaten by animals. You can also gather mature nuts from the tree by shaking the tree or knocking the nuts down with a pole."

Hit the nuts hard with the hammer to drive them through, leaving the hull behind.Warning: Always wear gloves when removing walnut hulls.

After you crack the nut, pick out the meat with a nutpick.Tip: Try softening the shells first by soaking them in water for 1-2 hours. Place the moist nuts in an airtight container overnight before cracking them. You can soften the shells a little more by soaking them in hot water again right before you crack them. You probably won\u2019t be able to crack black walnuts with a regular hand-held nutcracker. To crack multiple nuts at once, place up to 100 of them in a burlap bag and hit the bag with a mallet several times to crack the shells. You\u2019ll need to separate the nut fragments from the cracked shells by hand. If you don\u2019t want to crack the nuts right away, put them in a bag and store them at 32\u201340 \u00b0F (0\u20134 \u00b0C)."
