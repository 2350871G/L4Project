If you choose a pot that has dimensions larger than this, the roots will need to grow into the pot before the plant itself can begin to grow. In other words, the plant has to grow all the way down before it can grow upward."

          "description":"It\u2019s important to disinfect old pots before reusing them, as they can accumulate minerals or other debris that are detrimental to plant growth. Mineral salts, for example, can dehydrate your plant and keep it from flourishing. Other debris can harbor disease-causing organisms. To disinfect your pot, soak it in a solution containing one part bleach and nine parts water for at least ten minutes. Place it in a solution of water and dish detergent and then rinse. To clean mineral deposits and debris from a steel pot, use steel wool or a wire-bristle brush to scrub them away. Plastic pots only need a scrubbing pad. You can scrape off any remaining deposits with a knife. Once you\u2019ve cleaned the pot, rinse it with water and then soak it until ready for use."

Cover the drainage holes with something that will allow water to pass through, like paper towel or a coffee filter. Using a porous material like paper towel or a coffee filter over the drainage holes will allow water to pass through so your plant doesn't drown, but it slows down the process so the water can actually soak into the soil and help your plant."
