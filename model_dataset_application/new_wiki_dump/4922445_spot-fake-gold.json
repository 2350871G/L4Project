Gold bars typically have their weight inscribed on them. Make sure the actual weight matches this inscription. Many gold coins and pieces will also have their weight stamped on them.

Check the diameter and thickness of any gold coins you\u2019re considering buying. The specifications for collectible coins can be found in numismatic guides or online. Gold bars are sold in many different sizes, but the size of a standard gold bar is 7\u201dx 3 \u215d\u201d x 1 \u00be\u201d and weighs 400 ounces or 27.5 pounds. Determine the actual volume of irregular objects, such as rings, by placing them in a graduated cylinder accurate to .1 milliliters(mLs). Place 20mLs of water in the cylinder and add the object you wish to test. Record the difference in water level. 1 cubic centimeter is equal to 1 mL."

This test uses nitric acid to see if the gold has a chemical reaction with it. One hundred percent gold will have no reaction to the nitric acid. Put on safety goggles and gloves before working the the nitric acid. Make a light, small scratch on the gold using a nail file. Use an eyedropper to apply one drop of nitric acid to the scratch on the gold. If the liquid turns greenish, the item is probably mostly another metal like zinc and plated with gold.
