Cut smaller rectangular shapes out of the bags and use as separators between frozen food, such as bacon rashers, bread slices, frozen pastry layers etc. Store lettuce leaves in the bags for ready-made salads. Cover cookies, biscuits, slices etc. that need to be transported to bazaars, f\u00eates etc. Use for redistributing bulk items into smaller packaging, such as dry dog and cat food, washing powder etc. Use bulldog clips to tie down securely."
