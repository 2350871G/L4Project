          "headline":"Shoot from above.",
          "description":"Shooting the photo from above will provide a more flattering angle. It will likely emphasize your eyes and make your face and neck seem smaller. Shooting from below can make some people seem powerful, but it usually makes the chin and nose look prominent, which is not a flattering look for most people. It\u2019s best not to go too high so the photo doesn\u2019t get distorted. Hold the camera out and a little above eye level. Then take the picture."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Find the shadowed side of your face.",
          "description":"Look at your face in a mirror or the camera (or take a practice photo), and find which side of your face looks darker due to being further from the light source. Take the photo from the shadowed side for an artistic and slimming effect. This approach may not work in direct sunlight."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use artistic approaches.",
          "description":"Instead of a traditional, head-on self portrait, try taking the picture in a different way. Here are a few alternative shots you may consider:\nA profile shot from the side\nHalf of your face\u2014either the right or the left\nZoom in on your eye, mouth, or cheek"
        },
        {
          "headline":"Do not center yourself in the shot.",
          "description":"The best photographs follow what\u2019s known as the rule of thirds. This means that your eyes should be one third of the way down from the top of the photo and off to one side. This provides a more interesting photograph and probably a more flattering angle."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Keep the camera away from your face.",
          "description":"The lens of the camera will distort anything that it is physically close to. A selfie, because it\u2019s generally made by holding a camera within arm\u2019s length of your face, often makes the nose appear larger than it is, which is not a look that many people care for. If you want a close-up shot, zoom the camera in slightly, then hold it far away from you or take it further away and then crop the photo to make it seem as though it was taken close-up. If your camera has a timer, prop it up against something, set the timer and back away. The resulting photo will likely be much improved."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use your phone\u2019s main camera.",
          "description":"Though the rear-facing camera is more convenient for taking pictures of yourself, your smart phone\u2019s main camera is likely a much higher quality, and will take better pictures."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Place a mirror in front of your camera.",
          "description":"It is easier to see how you look a mirror, so if you place a mirror behind your camera or phone, you will be able to preview the picture you\u2019re about to take more effectively. Be sure you\u2019re not showing a fake smile!"
        },
        {
          "headline":"Have someone take the picture for you.",
          "description":"While this isn\u2019t always possible, having someone take a picture for you is usually preferable. You\u2019re more likely to be able to focus on what you\u2019re doing and how you\u2019re posing when you\u2019re not worrying about holding the camera and pressing the shutter button too. Ask a friend to take a photo for you. She may tease you about it, but she may also want you to take one of her. If you are at an event or doing an activity, ask someone else there to take a picture of you (and your friends if you\u2019re there with other people). Just be sure that the person is trustworthy so you don\u2019t have your phone or camera stolen."

          "description":"One of the least flattering features in a photograph is a double-chin. Usually, the double-chin look can be avoided if you lengthen your neck and move your chin out away from your body slightly. This will feel strange and awkward, but will be much more flattering in photos."

          "headline":"Pull your shoulders back.",
          "description":"Slouching shoulders and bad posture are never flattering, so be sure that you pull your shoulders down and back. This will make you look more alert, elongate your neck, and improve your photo. You may also try tilting your shoulders from one side or the other for the photograph instead of having them square with the camera."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Adjust your attitude.",
          "description":"Taking and sharing too many self-portraits that are all serious will make you seem serious or stuffy. Try taking a silly picture instead. Often when you relax and have a little fun, you will inadvertently take a more flattering picture."

        {
          "headline":"Angle your face or body.",

          "headline":"Look away from the camera.",
          "description":"Even if your eyes are your best feature, try looking away from the camera for a more interesting photograph. You can still emphasize your eyes by ensuring that they are wide open and looking above or to the side of the camera. Be sure to exaggerate looking away. If you look very slightly away from the lens, it will seem like you didn\u2019t know where the camera was. If you look at least a foot from the camera, it will come across as a deliberate choice."

        {
          "headline":"Show emotion.",
          "description":"True emotion usually comes through in your face. A fake smile is not usually a flattering smile, so if you want a smiling photo, think of something that makes you genuinely happy or something that is funny before snapping the shot. If you want to look happy, be sure you are smiling with your eyes, not just your mouth. The way to do this is to actually feel happy. It\u2019s okay to show other emotions, too, if you would prefer a self photo that is somber, flirty, sad, pensive, frustrated, or matter-of-fact. Just try being genuine."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Dress for the occasion.",
          "description":"If you are taking a self photo for a specific purpose, think about how you should dress for the picture. For a business photograph or for a profile for a business networking website, select modest, professional clothing and a neat hairstyle. For dating websites, you may want to wear something colorful or fun, but try not to look overly sexy (because you will likely look like you\u2019re trying too hard to be sexy). Style your hair in a casual way that shows that you have paid some attention to your look. For social media websites, think about how you want the world to perceive you. Your clothing choice is pretty wide-open, but unless you are showing off that you have just completed a 20-mile hike, it\u2019s unlikely that a dirty t-shirt is the best choice for a selfie."

          "description":"The duckface\u2014pursed lips that are slightly widened\u2014has become a clich\u00e9 and somewhat hated choice for self photos. Try another, more flattering, facial expression instead."

If you are able, take photos on an overcast day. If you are inside, try taking photos near a window with natural light (but not direct sunlight) coming in. If you must use light that isn\u2019t natural, avoid fluorescent lighting and overhead lighting. Indoors, you may be able to turn off overhead lights and turn on lamps for a better light effect. If direct overhead lighting (either natural or artificial) can\u2019t be avoided, use the flash on your camera to fill in light so that there are no shadows under your nose or eyes."

Bathrooms and messy bedrooms are often not the best choice for selfies, but they frequently occur there. A picture is never flattering if there is a toilet in the background. If you are indoors, find a neutral background such as a blank wall or a window. If you are outdoors or at an event, be sure to include yourself and your environment so that your picture tells a story."

Use both arms outstretched to hold the camera instead of one. Stand between two things, such as trees or bushes outdoors. Use your hand under or on your chin to frame the bottom of your photo."

          "description":"Any parts of the photograph that are not flattering can be cropped out. If you took the photo with one arm, it\u2019s usually best to crop the arm out of the picture, as it will look enlarged. If you think your hair looks crazy, crop it out. No one has to see the photos as you take them: don\u2019t be afraid to edit before you share."
