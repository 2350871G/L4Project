Your dough should be freshly-made and have rested in plastic wrap at room temperature for around 20 minutes. You\u2019ll only be working with one piece of dough at a time, so you can keep the remaining 3 wrapped in plastic so that they don\u2019t dry out. The best tool for this is called a \u201cbench scraper,\u201d which is a flat scraping tool. You can also use a large knife. You should make your dough right before you start using your pasta machine so that your noodles are fresh and taste the best."

Use the heel of your palm to gently knead the dough into shape. Keep your dough about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm)  thick and don\u2019t spread it out too much. This step is to get your dough ready for the machine, not to make it thinner. You should just use your hands for this step. A rolling pin will flatten out the dough too much."
