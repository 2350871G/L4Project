If your milk is refrigerated, take it out of the fridge and wait for it to reach room temperature. Make sure that you use fresh skim milk. Powdered milk or milk that is full or partial fat does not work to make milk paint. Don\u2019t warm the milk, just let it sit out. Warming the milk past 115 degrees Fahrenheit (46 degrees Celsius) breaks down the proteins of milk."

Once you see this, place the container with the curdling milk in a warm place and let it sit overnight or for up to two days. Make sure not to stir or to shake the container of milk. This will disturb the formation of the curds."
