          "description":"Reading the nutritional facts label will give you information that you need to make an informed decision when selecting your frozen meal. The nutritional facts label contains relevant nutrition information, such as the fat and sodium content, vitamins, and serving size of your meal. Make sure to read recommended daily values and assess if the meal you plan on buying will give you the nutrition and energy you need for the day. Note the serving size of your frozen meals, and adjust the values based on how much you eat. For example, if you have two servings in one package, you must multiply the calories by two to get an accurate account of how much you'll be eating."

          "headline":"Choose a meal low in sodium and saturated fat.",
          "description":"Too much sodium or saturated fat can be tough on your heart and blood vessels and can lead to things like high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, and heart disease. Avoid frozen meals that have more than 700 mg of sodium or more than 4 grams (0.14 oz) of saturated fat per serving. Foods high in potassium promote good cardiovascular health and can combat the effects of sodium and saturated fat. Meals that are high in saturated fat and sodium include fried chicken, Hungry Man Frozen Meals, and Stouffer\u2019s Cheese Ravioli."

          "headline":"Determine the number of calories in each meal.",
          "description":"Companies are required to list the number of calories which make frozen foods good for those that have diets that require them to calculate their daily caloric intake. While it may be tempting to go for the meal with the least amount of calories, it's advisable to stay away from meals that have too little calories. Choose meals between 350 and 500 calories per serving, so that you can get the nutrition you need while maintaining your diet. A meal that contains less than 200 calories won't give you the energy you need and you may be tempted to snack afterward. Low calorie frozen meals can lack fiber and necessary fats that keep you healthy."

          "description":"Purchase a frozen meal that has a variety of different foods to maintain a healthy and balanced diet. Things like whole grains, lean proteins, fruits, and vegetables are the healthiest options to go for. Eating a healthy and balanced diet stabilizes your weight and keeps you mentally and physically happy. Eat five portions of fruit and vegetables per day to get necessary nutrients into your system. Women should have 45 g of protein per day while men should have 55.5 g per day. Males should have 38 g of fiber per day and women should have 25 g on average."

If you see too many artificial ingredients or flavors, consider choosing a different brand or meal. Companies who utilize sustainable practices have fresher and healthier foods because they incorporate things like grass-fed beef and freshly caught fish in their meals. Some of the unhealthiest artificial ingredients found in many frozen meals include textured soy protein concentrate, carrageenan, maltodextrin, disodium inosinate, modified cornstarch, and disodium guanylate."

          "description":"Fried meals or meals with a creamy sauce or gravy are typically high in fat and sodium. Replace fried food with grilled or steamed variations. Certain frozen foods, like french fries, can be baked instead of fried to cut down on saturated fat. Meals that contain a creamy sauce like chicken pot pie can contain up to 14 grams of fat."

          "description":"Some frozen meals will come with a dessert. Instead of eating the dessert, replace it with a piece of fruit. Frozen meal desserts are often high in sodium and high fructose corn syrup while fruit is higher in fiber and has fewer calories. Healthy fruits include cantaloupe, strawberries, apples, and bananas."

For instance, if you have heart disease, you need to limit the amount of sodium and fat that you have each day and concentrate on eating a variety of vegetables, fruits, whole grains.
