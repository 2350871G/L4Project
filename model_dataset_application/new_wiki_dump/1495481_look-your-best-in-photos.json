          "description":"If you want to look good in photos, how you angle your body makes a huge difference. Standing or posing in a flattering manner can really improve your appearance. Full on body shots tend to be less flattering as they display the widest parts of your body. Instead of facing the camera directly, try turning about 30 degrees to the right. Then, turn your head towards the camera. This helps make your frame look slimmer in photos. If you want to look even slimmer, place your weight on your back leg. Then, turn your left foot slightly towards the camera. If you're sitting, move towards the edge of the chair. Keep your back straight. If you want a more laid back post, you can try leaning slightly forward and resting your elbows on your thighs."

          "headline":"Hold your head properly.",
          "description":"When it comes to looking best in photos, how you hold your head makes a huge difference. Raising your chin slightly can help slim your face and improve your look in photos. Stretch your neck before a photo. Then, push your chin forward. It might feel awkward, but it can help you look slimmer in photos. It can also give the face a more angular feel. However, make sure you don't raise your neck too high. This can result in your neck being too prominent in the picture, distracting from your face."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Smile naturally.",
          "description":"Smiling on cue can be difficult. However, a natural smile can help your photo look more authentic. Try your best to smile for real when having your picture taken. It seems odd, but practice smiling in front of a mirror. Try to think of something funny or something that makes you happy. This can help you smile. If you're able to give a natural smile on cue, this can help you look better in photos. However, watch the position of your face when you smile. Many people have a tendency to pull the chin inwards when smiling, which can result in your face looking bloated. Try to keep your head up when smiling."

          "headline":"Squeeze your shoulder blades.",
          "description":"Work on squeezing your shoulder blades together just before a picture of you is taken. Lifting your shoulders slightly and then pulling them back can help highlight your form. It also helps lift your torso, elongating your body to make you look slimmer."

Try to think of something fun to do with your arms when your photo is being taken. You can try placing your hands on your hips. This can help make your arms look slimmer. Try clasping your hands together when sitting. Just don't hold them too tight as this can result in your hands looking tense in the photo."

          "description":"If you wear make-up, spend some time making flattering make-up choices before taking a picture. This can help highlight your best features. Use a light layer of concealer. Too much concealer can make your face look pale or patchy in photos. In fact, it might be best to just use concealer when you need to. Dab it over discolorations and acne rather than all over your face. Use blush. Without blush, your face might look pale in a photo as the natural colors of your cheeks won't show up as well. However, don't overdo it. Use a light shade that works with your skin tone and try not to apply too close to your nose."

          "headline":"Wear brighter lipstick and exaggerate your eye liner.",
          "description":"Brighter colors tend to show up better in pictures. Make sure your lipstick and eye liner show up well in a photo. Dark lipstick choices can make your lips look smaller. Choose brighter shades, like pinks and reds, for photos. If you want your eyes to look great in the photo, enhance them with make-up. Add some eye liner and add shadow and mascara. Consider filling your eyebrows with pencil or powder, using a shade that matches your hair."

However, be aware of how to button your shirt for photos. If you're wearing a tie, it's best to button the shirt completely. Otherwise, you may look sloppy in the picture. When wearing a blazer, only button up the top buttons. Any other button down shirt may look best with one or two buttons near the top undone."

Even if you're insecure about your weight, a billowy top or loose fitting t-shirt will make you look larger. Select clothing that clings to your form. For women, select form-fitting dresses or flattering blouses and jeans or dress paints. For men, go for tighter jeans and slim-fitted button down shirts. If you're insecure about your weight, black can be a slimming color."

If you relax before a photo, you'll look happier and more natural. If you're camera shy, try taking a few deep breaths and relaxing when someone aims a camera in your direction. Remember, it's just a photo and if you don't like you can always request the person who took it delete it."
