          "headline":"Place the plant in bright indirect light.",
          "description":"In the northern hemisphere, if the light is from a north window, you might not have to worry too much about the sunlight being too strong. The same goes for full sun in winter because it's weaker than summer sun. However east, west or south sun is too strong for many plants and the plant must be placed further from the window or a translucent curtain  should be placed between the window and the plant. Too much sun will cause Easter cactus to turn yellow and crispy brown. The proper soil to use is a mixture of orchid potting mix and African violet mix. Mix these two in equal parts and add some cactus and succulent mix or garden sand, to help make sure that the soil drains well. It's best not to buy soil mixes with fertilizer already in them, as this can do more harm than good. Regular potting mix is too heavy for Easter cactus. This plant flowers best when its roots are crowded. It doesn't develop a large root system so only repot when it's not growing well and too crowded. Repot it after flowering during the dormant season or in the spring."

          "headline":"Water carefully.",
          "description":"One of the major care issues with Easter cactus is that it's very easy to overwater this plant. Keep your Easter cactus evenly moist and not soggy during growth and flowering. Once the soil  surface starts to feel dry to the touch, or the first segment of your (pointer) fingertip is dry when inserting your finger into the soil, the plant needs water. If your plant stems start shriveling and drying out, this means that the plant needs more water. If the plant starts turning yellow and soft your watering too much. Overwatering will cause brown scars on the plants, the plant to turn bluish grey, shrivel up and also the stems to fall off."

        {
          "headline":"Ensure the right temperature.",
          "description":"The preferred range is average room temperature (50 to 70 degree F) A good rule is the higher the temperature in a room, the more moisture a plant needs the lower the temperature the less moisture it needs. The moisture in the air (humidity) and the amount of water in the soil should be adjusted based on this rule depending on the room temperature. Do no expose your plant to extremes like cold and wet or hot and dry. A plant in a cool room grows more slowly, thus using less water and humidity. A plant in a warm room grows faster and this causes water loss. So the warm room plant will use more water and humidity."

          "description":"The plant does well in average humidity. Many sources say mist the plant daily or place it a larger tray with pebbles and water, but often times this leads to rot, fungi, mold and death of the plant. Pay attention to the plant if the stems are shriveling and the soil is moist, raise the humidity when you notice this. If you use a humidifier, indoor water decor, aquarium, or keep the plant cooler than requirements you don't need to raise the humidity."

          "description":"If these are not controlled in a prompt manner the plant will become sickly, stunted and even die. Spider mites are critters that produce fine cobwebs in your plant. These are not attractive to look at and if not gotten rid of, they will start to kill the plant and the plant will die. Many times spider mites are a sign that a plant is too hot and too dry. Cooling the plant down and raising the humidity will get rid of this pest, or help get under control. Mealybugs are white wooly bugs that resemble ghostly pill bugs. They form colonies of white wooly masses mostly in the \"notches\" or joints of the plant. These pest will not only suck the plant leaves but they can also leave a sticky honeydew trail that is a breeding ground for mold and fungus on infected plants. Scales are hard shelled insects that will resemble hard brown bumps scattered around the plant. They also excrete a sticky honeydew trail that can also support the growth of mildew or mold. You can easily get rid of these pest with by taking a damp cloth drenched in rubbing alcohol and gently wiping the pest off the plant. Drenching the plant with warm water in a shower can also help greatly. Use these techniques to treat all of the pest mentioned above. If the infestation  is heavy use any houseplant insecticide following directions on package. Watch out for slugs and snails when placed by open windows or in outdoor situations check for ragged holes in the plant. These guys can be plucked off the plant when seen. Chlorosis is a condition that causes the leaves usually of the center of the plant to turn a weird pale green yellow color. This means the fertilizer your using doesn't contain enough micro-nutrients to keep the plant healthy. All fertilizers contain three basic nutrients for plants.nitrogen(N), phosphorus(P), potassium(K) however some others have other nutrients like copper, selenium which helps plants grow better. Another problem is cold soil temps in the fall. Plastic, glazed or ceramic pots are more insulated than terracotta clay pots. Easter cactus doesn't like to be overwatered! There are several diseases of rot that will occur under soggy conditions. Drechslera Cladophyll Rot will cause black fuzzy spots of Drechslera fungus to grow on the leaves of the cactus. Erwinia Soft Rot causes slimy black spots to start at the soil line and take over the whole plant Fusarium Cladophyll Rot or Rust will cause tan to orange sores on the plant.Pythium and Phytophthora Rot will cause the plant to turn grayish green and roots to turn mushy.These rots cannot be treated and you can try to make cuttings and start new plants or throw the plant out."
