Spring and late summer are the ideal times to plant hostas, because they are in active growth phases and will take root easily. If you're going to plant hostas in late summer, do it at least six weeks before the first frost."

          "headline":"Choose a location with the right amount of shade.",
          "description":"Hostas are shade-tolerant plants that require minimal amounts of sunlight \u2013 though they also won\u2019t thrive in deep shade. The ideal location is somewhere protected from strong winds and hail, that\u2019s shaded between the hours of noon and 4 p.m., and that receives some filtered sunlight. You can protect hostas from sun, wind, and hail by planting them under established trees. Make sure you don\u2019t plant them too close to the roots, however, or the hostas will have to compete for nutrients. Hosta\u2019s shade tolerance depends on the type. As a rule, those with yellow leaves can survive more sunlight than hostas with green, blue, or white leaves. Blue hostas need the most protection from the sun. Hostas will also thrive near outer building corners that still get some mild sun exposure."

          "description":"In the area where you want to plant the hostas, till the ground to a depth of 8 inches (20 cm) using a manual tiller, rototiller, or hoe. Amend the soil with organic matter that will loosen the soil, discourage rodents, and acidify the soil slightly. Good organic matter for hostas includes aged manure or compost, peat moss, and leaf mulch. The ideal pH for hostas is between 6 and 6.5. Hostas don\u2019t need a large space for planting. If you're planting individual hostas, the hole only needs to be as wide as the root system."

It\u2019s especially important to soak the roots if that\u2019s the case with your hostas, because it will help prepare the plants for transplanting. Choose a bucket or bowl that\u2019s slightly smaller than the crown of the hosta. Fill the bucket with cold water. Rest one hosta crown on the rim of the bucket so the roots are soaking in the water below. Repeat for each hosta. Soak the plants for at least an hour before transplanting.

Use your fingers to carefully comb the roots so there aren't any tangles, and ensure all the roots are facing the direction they're growing in. Hostas, especially potted ones, are susceptible to tangled roots. The plants can strangle themselves if you try to plant them in the ground with their roots tangled."

Place one hosta in each hole, making sure the roots don\u2019t become bent or tangled. Fill the hole loosely with soil, but do not pack the soil around the roots. Make sure only the roots of the plant are buried, and that the entire crown is above the ground. Water each plant thoroughly immediately after planting. Leave enough space between the hostas to accommodate for their mature width. This will depend on the variety of hosta you have. If you're not sure, leave about 3 feet (76 cm) of space between the hostas."
