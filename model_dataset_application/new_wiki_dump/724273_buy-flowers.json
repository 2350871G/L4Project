In addition, you can call ahead and let them know your budget, and you\u2019ll get a custom bouquet designed by a professional.

You might not have as big of a selection here, but you\u2019ll usually have several options to choose from. Just pick whatever you see that you like the most! Grocery stores sometimes have a florist on duty who can help you pick out the perfect blooms. Some flowers don\u2019t ship well, even if they\u2019re in season, so you might not be able to get certain flowers in your area. On the other hand, you might have access to blooms you can\u2019t find anywhere else!"

Choose a service, then browse through their selection online. There are also services which allow you to order flowers over the phone if you would prefer to speak to an operator. Before you order anything online, always look online at the customer reviews to ensure you\u2019re going through a reputable vendor. You can also ask your family, friends, and social media contacts if they\u2019ve used a similar service and whether they were satisfied with the results. Some of the more popular floral delivery services include Teleflora, 1800 Flowers, and FTD. Keep in mind that since the flowers are being shipped, the vendor can\u2019t control the exact appearance of the arrangement when they arrive at their destination."

However, if you\u2019re buying flowers from a delivery service, take the time to make sure the blooms you pick are in season. If not, the flowers have probably been shipped from another country, and they might not be as fresh. Some flowers are perfectly fine when they\u2019re transported a long distance, but when you\u2019re buying online, it\u2019s better to stay on the safe side."

If the person you\u2019re buying flowers for is sunny and cheerful, for instance, stargazer lilies are a beautiful option, and they smell great too!

If you\u2019re not sure what to pick, think about their personality. If they\u2019re traditional, roses are a safe bet. If they\u2019re creative or tend to think out of the box, you might do better to go with another option.

Zinnias, lilies, purple hyacinth, gladiolus, and forget-me-nots are all common choices to send to a person who\u2019s grieving. Send along a short note with your flowers letting the recipient know you\u2019d love to take them to lunch when they\u2019re feeling up to it.

Use your best judgement. If you\u2019re buying an arrangement for your mom, don\u2019t choose flowers that make you think of a romantic occasion, and if you\u2019re buying flowers to take to a date, don\u2019t pick something that would look more appropriate in a hospital room."

In fact, if the temperatures will be above 70 \u00b0F (21 \u00b0C) outside, your gardenias could start to wilt and turn brown. If you\u2019re having a summer wedding, try garden roses, dahlias, birds-of-paradise, and zinnias. For a winter wedding, you can\u2019t go wrong with sweet pea, forget-me-nots, or hydrangeas."
