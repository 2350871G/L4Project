  "text":" Simple Method Gather your ingredients. You'll need milk, china grass (commonly known as \"Kadal Paasi\" in Tamil, also called agar-agar), Sarsaparilla syrup (called \"Nannaari Syrup\" in Tamil) or rose syrup, and vanilla ice cream. Boil the milk. This will thicken the milk to help the taste and texture of the drink. Boil until the milk has been reduced to half its original volume and has turned a pale yellow color. Then let the milk cool, and refrigerate to chill it. Prepare the china grass. Soak it in water for about three hours, or until it looks like pieces of jelly. Once it reaches this point, remove it from the water. Mix the drink. Fill about half of a large glass with the reduced milk. Mix the Sarsaparilla syrup and china grass into the milk, stirring well to combine the flavors. Then top with a scoop of ice cream and enjoy. Using Sago Gather your ingredients. You'll need about five cups of milk; five grams of china grass (agar agar), cut into cubes; a cup or less of sugar or Milkmaid; a tablespoon of nannari syrup or rose syrup, if nannari is not available; one small cup of sago (also called javarishi or sabudana), soaked in water for a few hours and cut into cubes; and a scoop of ice cream. Boil the milk in a saucepan. Boil until it has thickened, reduced in volume, and become slightly pink. Add sugar or Milkmaid to taste, making sure to completely dissolve it in the milk. Once the milk has boiled enough, allow it to come to room temperature, and then refrigerate to thoroughly chill it. Transfer some of the hot milk to another vessel and add the sago. Cook the sago in the boiled milk until it becomes transparent. Keep this separately and refrigerate. With the rest of the boiled milk, allow it to cool to room temperature, and then refrigerate to thoroughly chill it. Prepare the china grass or Agar Agar jelly. Soak it appropriately in water and then cut it into small cubes which you will add to your drink. Mix the drink. Pour one ladle full of the milk with sago into a large glass or tumbler, making sure that you get enough sago at the bottom of your glass. Add a tablespoon of the china grass jelly that you cut into cubes. Then add the nannari or rose syrup, and pour the chilled milk on top, leaving just an inch or two in the top of the tumbler.
