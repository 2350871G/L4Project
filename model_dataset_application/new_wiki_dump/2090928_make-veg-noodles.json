Almost any veggie can be used in this recipe. Pick a few of your favorite veggies to serve with the noodles. Popular combinations include mushrooms, onion, and zucchini; carrot, red bell pepper, and potatoes; or even green bell pepper, green onions, and baby corns. Only use 3-4 types of vegetables. Whole wheat noodles are a healthy alternative to regular Chinese noodles. Garlic and ginger are also commonly added to veg noodles, but depending on your preference, you may choose to avoid these strong flavors. Some people also enjoy adding chili sauce or powder to veg noodles. This will make them spicy."
