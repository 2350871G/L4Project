          "description":"Grilling wood is generally sold as chips, chunks, and logs. Pick an appropriate wood type depending on the type of grilling you're doing and the size of your grill. Chips have a relatively short burn time, so only use them as a last resort if other sources of mesquite are not available. Chunks are fist-size pieces of wood and work well for those in the city with smaller grills. They last a lot longer than chips, although they take longer to ignite. Logs are full pieces of wood. If you have a barbecue pit, logs can work for you. However, logs are more suited for things like campfire and chunks can work just as well for grilling in a barbecue pit."

If you don't have a smoker box, purchase one at a department store or online before attempting to grill with wood. If you're using a charcoal grill, a smoker box is not necessary."

Your meat should cook between 225 and 250 degrees Fahrenheit (about 107 to 121 degrees Celsius). If the grill becomes too warm or too hot, adjust as necessary. For a grill that's too warm, close the vents. This will reduce the oxygen level and then reduce the temperature. For a grill that's too cold, open the vents to increase oxygen flow."

As you near the end of cooking time, which varies depending on the type of meat you're cooking, it's okay to peek to make sure the meat's not burning. However, as long as the temperature is stable and the meat is in the beginning or middle of cooking, leave the lid on. Lifting the lid too often can can cause the coals to burn out too quickly."

Poultry should be cooked to 165 degrees Fahrenheit (about 74 degrees Fahrenheit). Pork and ham should be cooked to 145 degrees Fahrenheit (about 63 degrees Celsius).
