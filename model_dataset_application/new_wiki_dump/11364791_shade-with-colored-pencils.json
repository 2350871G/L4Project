When you color quickly, you\u2019re more likely to press too hard and create messy lines. Apply a consistent pressure to make your drawings come out even in color. Holding your pencil at an angle helps to control your arm movements and slow down a bit."

This is helpful for layering or if you\u2019re trying to cover a large area in a faster amount of time. The lighter you press on the paper with the colored pencil, the lighter the color you\u2019ll create. Holding your pencil farther back, as opposed to right next to the tip, will help you keep your shading light because you won\u2019t be applying as much pressure."

If you\u2019re using the tip and pressing down, know that your color is going to come out more concentrated, so you\u2019ll want to be very sure about your marks before you make them. Use the tip of your colored pencil to create fine details or outline parts of drawings. Keep sharpening your pencil when it becomes dull so the tip remains sharp."

Even if you\u2019re only using one color, apply a layer of light color by holding your pencil softly, and then keep adding light layers on top of that one until you reach your desired shade. Avoid immediately using pressure to create bright colors. This makes it very hard to add other colors on top of it, and it makes your shading look uneven."

If you rub your paper with the eraser, it\u2019s just going smear the color and ruin your picture. While it's unlikely that you'll completely erase the colored pencil marks, blotting at them with an eraser may lighten them significantly. Try purchasing colored pencils that are specifically designed to erase and come with their own special erasers if desired."

The more circular marks you layer on top of one another, the more vibrant the color you\u2019ll create. Another name for this method is scumbling. Use this method to color in a flower or large object that's all the same color."

Create your hatch marks as close or far apart from one another as you\u2019d like. The closer together you make your marks, the more colorful your drawing will seem. You might use hatch marks to show the shading and shadows of a hand or a pillow."

This creates a bunch of \u2018X\u2019 marks right beside one another. This is a great way to shade in your drawing to give it a uniform look. Crosshatching is useful if you\u2019re blending two colors together\u2060\u2014you can use one color for one set of parallel lines, and the other color for the other set of parallel lines going the opposite direction. Use crosshatching to shade in a picture of a barn or a piece of fruit."

Make the dots as thin or thick as you\u2019d like, experimenting with different versions until you find one you like the best.

As you keep adding layers, you\u2019ll need to press harder for the colored pencil to show up, which is what creates the shiny quality. Burnishing can take a long time due to the number of layers you\u2019ll need to add on top of one another to create the smooth look. Try drawing the sunset or a vegetable using the burnishing method.
