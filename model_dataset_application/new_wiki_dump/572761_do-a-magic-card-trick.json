          "description":"Make a show of shuffling your deck. Part of a successful magic trick involves drawing your audience\u2019s attention somewhere specific. Shuffle the deck once, then let your spectator shuffle the cards or cut the deck to show that the arrangement of the cards is completely random. After they shuffle the deck, memorize the bottom card. One way to do this is to cut the deck as the very last shuffling action you do, then sneak a peek at the bottom card as you tap the cards on the table. Another option is to glance at the bottom card before you go to shuffle the cards one last time. Two methods for making sure the card on the bottom stays on the bottom when shuffling are:\nWhen performing a Riffle shuffle, make sure that you always start the shuffle with the hand that has the bottom card in it.This way, your bottom card stays the same as it hits the table first. In an Overhand shuffle, angle the face of the cards away from your audience. Cut the deck, but grip the bottom card with the pads of your fingers. While you separate the deck to shuffle, pull back on the bottom card so it doesn\u2019t get pulled up, but stays on the bottom."

Your original bottom card which you\u2019ve memorized and your spectator's card will end up somewhere in the middle of the deck. When you turn the deck over and fan them out, the person's card should be on top of, and to the right of the card that you memorized. If you have good sleight of hand, you might want to cut the deck a few times.

Hold the three random cards behind the Jack that\u2019s on top so the audience cannot see them. This is essential to the trick. If you are having trouble hiding the other cards, hold them in place by putting your index finger on the top edge of the cards. Once you have given your audience a bit of time to see the Jacks, square the cards together.

At this point, the card your spectator picked is sandwiched between her hands, but she will think it is the card you just showed her. This card is on top of the deck. Go looking for the card. Tell your spectator that you're going to switch the card she\u2019s holding right now magically with the card they selected initially. Go hunting around the deck as if you were looking for their card, all the while knowing your spectator already has it. Settle on the card that's already on top of the deck which your spectator thinks is in between her hands. Do the reveal. Finally, reveal that you have the card your spectator believed was in her hands. Ask your spectator to look at the card she has, revealing that it is her original card.",
