          "description":"Sesame oil can be used like any other type of cooking oil. It works best for sauteing any meat or vegetable. Pour the oil to the pan, heat it up, then add what you want to cook. Make sure you\u2019re using the light-colored sesame oil, since the dark variety will cause your food to taste terrible if you cook with it for too long. Regular sesame oil has a smoke point of about 410 \u00b0F (210 \u00b0C), so it can get pretty hot without burning. You may sometimes see refined and unrefined white sesame oil. The refined variety is processed to resist higher temperatures, making it good for frying or cooking over high heat. The refined type is a little less heat resistant but more flavorful."

          "headline":"Make stir fry dishes using sesame oil as a base.",
          "description":"Combine about \u20442 teaspoon (2.5 mL) of sesame oil with up to 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of soy sauce and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of rice vinegar. Mix it with additional ingredients like brown sugar, chili flakes, and sesame seeds if you prefer. Begin to cook the stir fry in olive oil and then pour the sesame sauce in with about 2 minutes to go. Stir the ingredients together as they cook to finish the stir fry. A stir fry is the most common way to cook with sesame oil since it\u2019s so customizable. Try adding up to 3 cups (450 g) of any veggies and 1 \u00bd cups (337.50 g) of meat you enjoy. Also, select up to 4 cups (400 g) of rice or noodles. Another way to make a stir fry is by cooking the ingredients directly in sesame oil. Many recipes combine the oil with soy sauce or another type of oil first, but it isn\u2019t necessary. Both refined and unrefined sesame oil can be used this way."

          "headline":"Fry food by covering it with hot sesame oil.",
          "description":"Sesame oil is relatively healthy and has a high heat resistance compared to other types of oil, making it a popular choice for frying. For example, heat \u20442 teaspoon (2.5 mL) of oil in a pan, then brown fresh dumplings in it. Sesame oil has also traditionally been used to fry food like tempura, cakes, and dough. Tempura is basically a Japanese dish consisting of fried seafood or vegetables. To make it, coat the food in batter, then submerge it in a pot of hot sesame oil. Sesame oil isn\u2019t used as frequently these days because it costs more than vegetable and canola oil. However, many people use it to make a lighter, crispier batter."

          "description":"Whip up a marinade to soak meat in before preparing it! You could combine 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of sesame oil with 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of low-sodium soy sauce and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of lime juice for a basic marinade. Add seasonings like garlic, chili flakes, and ginger if you wish. Then, put the marinade in a bag with a piece of sirloin steak for at least 20 minutes. Use unrefined sesame oil to give the meat a little bit of sesame flavor. If you prefer a stronger flavor, you can use dark sesame oil as long as you mix it with other liquids like soy sauce. A marinade can be made with whatever meat and seasonings you prefer. For instance, you could mix canola oil, rice wine vinegar, honey, and other ingredients. The marinade works well for flavoring chicken, beef, and even fish."

Mix in salt in pepper, then pour it onto vegetables like asparagus or lettuce. Add oranges, sesame seeds, and other ingredients for additional flavor.
