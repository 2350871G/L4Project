Make sure to choose an insulating material that is heat resistant, such as cotton batting. Do not use polyester batting. Depending on the thickness of the insulation fabric, you may need more than 1 layer per side of the oven mitts. Compare the thickness of the fabric to the thickness of a pair of pre-made oven mitts, or just double the insulating fabric if you are unsure. It is better to have too much insulation than not enough."

Make sure to leave about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) of space around the edges if you are tracing an oven mitt and 1 in (2.5 cm) if you are tracing your hand. After you finish tracing the mitt or your hand, cut along the lines. If you are tracing your hand, keep your fingers together and your thumb out to the side of them. Your thumb should be at about a 45 degree angle from your hand to ensure that there is plenty of room for the space beside your thumb and fingers."

Try different placements of the pattern on the fabric to see what you like best, and then pin the pattern in place. For example, if the pattern has stripes, consider if you want them to go vertically, horizontally, or diagonally across the mitts.

Start in 1 corner of the mitt and draw a diagonal line 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) from the corner going from 1 edge to the other.
