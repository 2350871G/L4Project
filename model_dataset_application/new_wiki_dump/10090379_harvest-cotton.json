          "description":"Before they are ripe, cotton bolls are closed up and resemble large seeds. They are greenish brown in color and often solid. Once the plant goes into bloom, it develops the white, fluffy cotton. If you are using a cotton picker, wait until the majority of your crops have exposed cotton balls. This way, you can maximize your yield."

          "description":"Cotton is typically planted in April. In general, it takes 150-180 days from planting until cotton is ready for harvest. If you live in an area with warm temperatures in the spring and summer, your cotton should be ready for harvest by the end of July. Do this if you live somewhere with very warm springs and summers."

If your cotton is not ready for harvest in July, let it grow until the bolls open up. This on average occurs throughout the fall if you live in an area with more mild spring and summer weather."
