Black Knight\u2014The Knight class possesses great defense with decent attack damage. They're able to use skills that can summon swords, which is great in inflicting damage. This class is ideal for new players. Priest\u2014This is the best healing class with great single-target stun. Priests are able to put groups of enemies to sleep, a good strategy especially when you have a mage in your party. Ranger\u2014This is a range class with support skills such as healing. This class can also summon a bear, which can be played as the attacker or tank for the party. Warlock\u2014This class has the highest DPS because of its high speed attack, which sends damage through the roof, great for slowing enemies, making them an easy target for the rest of your party. Moreover, Warlocks can wear Plate Mail, which increases their defense. Warrior\u2014Warrior is a great tank and damage class with stun skills. A mixture between the Knight and Assassin since this class can duel wield weapons."

Having enough space in your inventory for items is important in the later part of the game, especially when you need to do heavy mob leveling. Going back to the city just to clear your inventory for more space is dreadful. There's not much to spending money in the early levels of the game, and the extra space will let you pick up everything and even store enough potions for survival. This technique works well until level 70."
