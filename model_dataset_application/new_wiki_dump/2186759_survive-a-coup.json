Move to the innermost area of your building, such as a basement or a room without windows on the lowest level of the building. If you are already in a building, then do not go out until the conflict is over. If you are outside, then get to a building right away. You may also want to stay low to the ground or even take cover under a table or behind a wall."

Your friends, family, neighbors, and others will likely be posting frequent updates during the coup. Check your social media accounts regularly during the coup to keep yourself informed. Stay tuned into social media sites like Facebook and Twitter to get regular updates on what is happening. You can also post updates for your friends and family to let them know you are okay and to give information about what is happening in your area.

If you are out in the community and the local authorities direct you to a shelter or advise you to avoid part of your city, then it is best to listen to them. Do not try to enter a dangerous area if the authorities have advised you against it. Go where they tell you to go. Also, avoid being defiant or combative towards the authorities. Even if you are in favor of the coup, do not antagonize the authorities. This may cause you to get arrested or endanger your life."
