          "description":"It might seem counterintuitive, but larger pieces work better for small spaces\u2014just don\u2019t use too many! For example, one large table in your dining room can make it feel large and expansive. Conversely, 2 smaller tables will make it look cluttered. Invest your money into quality furniture for the best value. Ask yourself how you can create more space with each piece of furniture you add. For example, use oval dining room tables instead of square tables since they usually take up less space. Use pedestal style tables\u2014which have just one central support and offer the most legroom\u2014for dining rooms and areas that need to accommodate more people at the table. Consider getting a sectional couch for your living room. This lets you seat several people on one piece of furniture instead of needing several (e.g., a loveseat and a couple of arm chairs). It will also help the room look more open."

          "description":"A great way to maximize space is to use furniture for multiple purposes. For example, a bedroom chest can be used for storing clothing as well as a makeshift bedside table. Look for any other furniture that can double as storage space and you'll minimize the clutter. Use the space underneath beds and couches to store boxes of clothing and accessories. You can mount shelves to store books, boxes, and decorative pieces, then attach hooks to the undersides to hang up coats, hats, and umbrellas. Just make sure the shelf is securely mounted to the wall so the weight of hanging items doesn\u2019t pull it down."

          "description":"It's best to give yourself the option of folding up unused furniture when unused so that they take up a minimal amount of space. Check local home improvement stores for foldable dining room tables, desks, and couches and get into the habit of folding them up when you're not using them. Consider installing a folding door if you have a one-wall kitchen. Always remove your mail and books that accumulate on your tables to motivate you to fold them up! This will eliminate lots of clutter. A folding table can double as a desk in your bedroom or table in your dining room."

You should also consider adding some hooks to hang tools, towels, and pot holders. Regardless of what you choose, you'll need to drill holes in your wall with an electric drill and fasten your shelves or hooks using nails. Visit the local home hardware store to purchase wall-mounted shelves and hooks. Try wall-mounted shelves in your bedroom if you have lots of books or toys."

Stick to thin, lightweight drapes as opposed to heavy, bulky types. Extend your curtain rod at least 4 inches (10 cm) to each side to make your windows look wider. If you want to dress your windows, stick to tailored panels or sheers. Keep your curtains open as much as possible to let in natural sunlight.

For example, select one wall in your living room\u2014such as the one behind a couch \u2013 and line it with a large mirror. You can also create a mirrored backsplash in a small-sized kitchen to provide the illusion of space. If you don't have a large mirror, create a gallery of smaller mirrors of varying shapes and sizes. Use mirrors to brighten up a room that doesn\u2019t have windows or natural light. If you hang mirrors in a room with windows, place the mirrors directly opposite the windows so that they reflect more light."

Ideally, the surrounding furniture should be able to partially sit on each one. Be sure to take measurements of the length and width of your room before buying a rug to make sure it can cover enough space\nFind a rug that is large enough to extend from wall-to-wall in at least one direction."

White, beige, gray, and black are the safest bets. Other options include ivory, cream, sand, camel, khaki, olive, tan, and charcoal. Check out the neutral blue paint options at your local home improvement store if you prefer a bit of a livelier tone. While neutrals may seem boring by themselves, they make decorating much easier. Since neutrals go well with most other colors, you can add more colorful d\u00e9cor without having to worry about it clashing with your walls."

          "description":"With a smaller space, you have fewer things to look at, which means it's easier to notice clashing elements. Choose a limited color palette and stick to it. For example, if you paint your walls gray, choose furniture and accessories that are darker or lighter shades of gray. Try to choose 2 to 3 shades and stick with them. Add a different color to spice things up, but keep it neutral. For example, a gray color palette would benefit from a loveseat that's a neutral shade of blue. Look at your room and find anything that sticks out like a sore thumb. If there's a picture frame or chair that just doesn't fit, replace it with something that fits the theme! Don\u2019t be afraid to remove things that you don\u2019t enjoy or that just don\u2019t feel right in the room. Connect adjoining rooms by using similar colors. For example, match the colors of your living room pillows to the dominant colors in your dining room to create harmony."

This is a mild way of adding variety to your room without going overboard and making things look too distracting\u2014too many patterns will make smaller spaces feel cluttered. If you want to add some patterns to your design, do so for smaller pieces of furniture, such as pillows. For example, keep your couch colors muted and add a large patterned pillow to inject some drama into your theme. You can cycle through pillows and throw blankets in different colors to go with the changing seasons."

For example, a Greek key tile pattern or colorful rug is a nice choice. When it comes to your backsplash, choose a similarly eye-catching pattern. Install a new backsplash if you want to remodel your bathroom on a budget. If you\u2019re renting, you can install a temporary peel-and-stick backsplash and floor tiles.

Select wall towels with colors that reinforce your bathroom\u2019s color scheme. For example, if your d\u00e9cor is navy blue and your walls are off-white, choose towels of these color.
