Begin touching the oil as soon as you pour it into the pan, while it is still room temperature. Touch it every thirty seconds or so after that, to avoid allowing it to get hot. As soon as it is warm to touch, remove it from the heat. If you're worried you left your oil on the stove too long and it may have gotten hot, remove it from the heat and let it sit for a bit before touching it with your fingertip.
