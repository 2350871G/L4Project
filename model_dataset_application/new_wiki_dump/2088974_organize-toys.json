          "description":"If toys are taking over your home, split up storage space by toy type. Split up your child's bedroom, or your living room, into different sections. Each section can house a different type of toy. In a child's bedroom, separate corners of each room for different toy types. You can, for example, keep stuffed animals in one corner. In the closet, one half can be dedicated to action figures while the other can store plastic animal toys. You can use decorative storage baskets and bins in common areas of your home. For example, you could keep your kid's lego collection in an attractive basket that matches the color scheme of your living room. You can also separate the toys by type. For example, place active toys on 1 side of the room, while toys that require your child to sit and play are stored in a different area. This is especially helpful for organizing a playroom."

          "headline":"Swap out a toy box for individual bins.",
          "description":"One big toy box can present a problem. Toy boxes tend to get messy easily, as they don't have separate storage compartments. Your child will also easily make a mess digging through a toy box. Instead of a toy box, make a run to a local department store. Buy a variety of bins, boxes, and baskets in a variety of shapes and sizes. You can store toys by type instead of storing multiple toys in one bin. For extra organization, look for bins divided into sections. If you're storing something like action figures, they can be divided by type in different sections of a single bin. Clear bins are a great option because they allow your child to see inside without opening the bins. This way they can pick out the toy they want without digging through several bins."

          "headline":"Buy furniture with built-in storage features.",
          "description":"When selecting furniture, look for items that come with storage features. Look for stools and bookshelves with drawers and bins built in. Many children's beds come with drawers built into the bottom. Every time you need a new piece of furniture, see this as an opportunity to further organize your child's toys."

          "description":"Once you've separated the toys into different sections and bins, label them. You don't want to be scrambling to find your child's G.I. Joes because you forgot whether you put them in the red or green bin. Labels can also help young children remember what goes where when cleaning up. If you have very young children, use visual labels. Print out a picture of the type of toy stored in that bin and tape it on. This makes it easier for your child to participate in the clean up process. You can also color coordinate the boxes if your child is very young."

Periodically do a sweep of your home. Identify any toys that are no longer used. Box up unwanted toys. Swing by a local thrift store and offer them as a donation. You can encourage your children to join in on the process. Point out the positives about donating toys, such as helping a child in need. You can also do something like provide your child with one box. Tell them they can keep everything that fits in the single box, and must discard everything else. When cleaning, always take a mental note of which toys need to be put away often and which toys you do not frequently see. This can help you decide what to keep and what to donate."

A shoe tree is a particularly good place to store plastic figurines, as these may scratch or break if stored in a box or basket."

This will keep your organizational structure intact and make cleanup easier. Be gentle when reminding your children of this rule. Do not yell, but say something like, \"Hey, are your Legos away? You need to put them away before you take out your dolls.\" Acknowledge you hear your child's complaints instead of scolding or dismissing them. This makes your child more likely to cooperate. Say something like, \"I know you think putting away your stuffed animals will take forever, but it will make things so much easier later.\" Be firm with your rule and don't allow your child to take out a new toy while another is still out.
