In order to soften everything up, of course, stew requires a substantial cooking time. This means that you actually want to avoid the fancy cuts that are considered the best for steaks, because they will turn tough and chewy when cooked in a stew. It\u2019s not the fat you\u2019re looking for in a tough cut, it\u2019s the collagen. This is the connective tissue within the flesh itself that will break down over a long cooking period, leaving the meat tender and juicy. In general, flesh from the front shoulder or rear end of an animal will be the toughest and leanest."

Even within these areas of an animal\u2019s body, however, there are all sorts of specific cuts of meat. All of the following cuts will work great in a stew: Chuck, Chuck Shoulder, Chuck Roast, Chuck-Eye Roast, Top Chuck, Bottom Round Roast, Bottom Eye Roast, Rump Roast, Eye Round Roast, Top Round, Round Tip Roast, English Roast, and Pot Roast."

However, in many cases it is instead an assemblage of the odds and ends from different cuts of meat. The reasoning here is that those pieces of meat from different parts of the animal will cook at different rates. With pre-cut \u201cstew meat\u201d that feature different cuts of meat, you'll end up with some tender pieces of meat in your finished stew, but others that are tough and chewy. Further, fat content will differ between pieces of meat, making it hard to tell how lean your meal will be. If stew meat is the best option, choose the package that seems to have pieces that are generally the same size, and which contain visible white striping within the flesh."

Since the shoulder is constantly used when the animal is alive, the muscles that make up this cut of meat are initially very tough. After stewing, however, pieces of chuck roast will be especially succulent and flavorful."

First, it will be easier to trim away the gristle from a larger cut of meat, as opposed to small pieces. Further, by doing it yourself, you can ensure that the size of the individual pieces are uniform. As a rule of thumb, shoot for cubes of meat that are a bit larger than 1x1in (2.5x2.5cm)."

Almost any cut of lamb will work in a stew, but shoulder is the best. Buy a piece of shoulder with the bone removed and cut it into evenly-sized pieces yourself. For a slightly cheaper but comparable option, look for arm shoulder chop or cut of meat from the neck."
