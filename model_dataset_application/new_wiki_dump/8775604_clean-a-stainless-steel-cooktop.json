          "description":"Mix a few drops of mild dish soap with a few cups of warm water. Dampen a sponge or dish cloth with the mixture. Gently wipe the stainless steel cooktop in the direction of its grain. The grain of a stainless steel cooktop refers to the orientation of the small flecks or striations in the surface. You can detect the grain of the stainless steel by looking closely at it. The grain may have an up/down, left/right, or diagonal orientation. There is no need to carefully measure the water or soap. As long as the water is warm and sudsy, your cleaning efforts will surely meet with success."

          "description":"If you want your stainless steel cooktop to not only be clean, but look clean, apply polish after cleaning it. After you're done cleaning your stainless steel cooktop, burnish it using stainless steel polish, lemon oil, or a silicone-based spray. Apply the polish with a clean, lint-free cloth, moving with the grain. Use another lint-free cloth to dry the polishing agent. There are a wide variety of products that polish stainless steel cooktops. Most double as cleaning agents, as well. Bar Keeper's Friend and Weiman Stainless Steel Cleaner & Polish, for instance, can be used to both clean and polish your stainless steel cooktop. Directions for use vary depending on the product you select to maintain your stainless steel cooktop's luster. Consult manufacturer directions before use. Generally, though, you'll have to aim the product's nozzle at the stainless steel cooktop, squeeze the spray handle several times, then wipe the product away."

Likewise, cleaning agents containing alcohol, mineral spirits, and ammonia can cause your stainless steel cooktop to corrode. To avoid using these products, carefully read the label on the exterior of any cleaning product before utilizing it. If you're unsure whether a stainless steel cleaning agent might damage your stainless steel cooktop, apply it to a small, relatively hidden portion of the cooktop (the back or sides, for example) and wait a day or two. Examine the stainless steel cooktop. If the area appears damaged or corroded, do not apply the cleaning agent to the rest of the cooktop. Avoid cleaning compounds that contain grit."
