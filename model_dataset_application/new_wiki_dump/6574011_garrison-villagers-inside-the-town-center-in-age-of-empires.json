Ringing the Town Bell will make your villagers garrison inside the nearest building that has garrisoning ability, not just the Town Center. This includes buildings such as Towers and Castles. If your villagers are too far away from a building that has garrisoning ability, they won\u2019t garrison when you ring the Town Bell. You may have to manually garrison them."
