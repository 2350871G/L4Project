If the flush seems weak, then you need more water. If the flush seems too strong then dial the water level back. If you\u2019ve had problems with your toilet clogging, then you probably need more water for a stronger flush. A telltale sign that your flush is too strong is that there is a lot of water left in the bowl when you hear the \u201cglug\u201d sound of the toilet flushing. The bowl should be nearly empty when you hear that sound. If the water is still above the drain hole when you hear the \"glug,\" reduce the toilet's flush level."
