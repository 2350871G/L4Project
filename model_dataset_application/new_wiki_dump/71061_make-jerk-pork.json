If you keep it on the grill, all the juice will fall out, and not into the meat. You can also use the indirect heat method of cooking. Heat one side of the grill, and keep the meat on the opposite side."

      "description":"This allows the meat to firm slightly, and retain it's tenderness. Chop the pork shoulder into bite size pieces when it is ready to serve. You can catch the drippings of the meat in a small pan and use it to make gravy for your meal. (While your meat is resting, in a small frying pan, start sauteing some diced onions with a small amount of cooking oil. When they start to brown, add your drippings from the roast. Allow the mixture to get hot. While this is going on, mix together 2 tbsp of all purpose flour with cold water, and mix well, until no lumps are in the mixture. Slowly add flour and water to your gravy until desired thickness is achieved. Allow gravy to cook for 5 minutes to that the flour taste is cooked out. You can add some of your left-over jerk seasoning to the gravy while it's cooking, for an extra hit of flavour)."
