Your loop should use up about one half to one third of the lace, and the rest of the lace should dangle to the side. Note that this method does not begin with the usual starting knot. In fact, in this method, the two laces are not tied together and the ends are not secured. Essentially, this is a decorative technique used to take care of the laces in a manner that keeps them from getting in the way as you walk. The coils formed by this knot method will stay firmly in place if secured well, but they will not secure the shoe to your foot like other knots will. Make sure that your moccasins are tight enough to be worn as slip-on shoes when using this lace tying method."

Continue wrapping the lace end around the loop in this manner until you reach the top of the loop and have only a short tail left. Make sure that each coil or wrap is immediately above the one before it. Otherwise, the overall coil you end up with may not be secure enough to hold together.
