Plus, using fresh mozzarella that will bubble as the pizza cooks will just make everything better. Slice some freshwater mozzarella and arrange it on top of the pizza. You can add different cheeses to make a more complex flavor as well. For example, slices of gouda or asiago can add some sharpness to the pizza. If you don\u2019t have any freshwater mozzarella, shredded cheese works great, too! If you\u2019re a vegan or you have a dairy allergy, use a plant-based vegan cheese to add some gooey goodness to your pizza!"
