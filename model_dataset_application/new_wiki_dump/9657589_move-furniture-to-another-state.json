If you\u2019re making a long move to another state, having movers take care of your furniture can save you time and aggravation. You should ask several moving companies for a quote before settling one one. Cross country movers usually charge by the pound or load rather than the hour. Rates average $0.50 USD a pound. If you are renting a moving truck to ship the furniture yourself, expect it to cost several hundred dollars."

If you have a lower quote from a competing company, you may be able to ask another that you prefer to match it. You are also more likely to get better rates from moving companies if you can move in an off-peak season (fall or winter). Midweek moves may also be cheaper than weekend ones."
