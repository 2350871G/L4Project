When measuring, measure the distance from the center of one hole to the center of the next. It is best to do this step with help from at least 1 other person.

The track should be close enough to the light fixture to insert the floating feed into the track. This is important because the floating feed will be the track\u2019s source of power. Insert toggle bolts into the track\u2019s holes. After threading the toggle bolts through the lighting track\u2019s holes, screw on the toggle bolt nut. The spring-loaded nut should be positioned so that it looks like an upside-down \u201cV\u201d when you squeeze it. Screw the lighting track into the ceiling.

Closely follow the manufacturer\u2019s directions included with the specific track lighting system you purchased. Put the track lighting fixtures in the track. You can find a wide variety of track lighting fixtures at most home improve stores. You should be able to find one that is a size and style that fits your needs.
