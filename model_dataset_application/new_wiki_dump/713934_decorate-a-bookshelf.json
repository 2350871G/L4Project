Be sure not to get carried away, however, or your shelf will look cluttered and disorganized. Here are some ideas:\nAdd a low maintenance plant, such as a: aloe, English ivy, heart-leaf philodendron, jade plant, moth orchid, peace lily, pothos, snake plant, and spider plant. Add a fishbowl with a betta fish in it. Betta fish are colorful and low maintenance. . If you like to collect anything, such as figurines or china, consider putting it on display on your shelf. Place photographs and artworks in frames, and set them on your shelf. Add something metallic for eye-catching sparkle. If you don't have anything metallic, then choose a figurine and paint it using silver, gold, or bronze spray paint. Add a mirror to create depth. You can either place the mirror against the back of the shelf, or place a small, framed mirror on top of a stack of books."

Use these baskets to store items you don't want on display, such as crafting supplies or video game controls.

Once you have the pegs in their new positions, place the shelf back onto them. You can also create horizontal divisions in your bookshelf by cutting a spare shelf into smaller sections, and then sticking those sections inside."
