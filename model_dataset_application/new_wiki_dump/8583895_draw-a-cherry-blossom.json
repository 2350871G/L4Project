Drawing them from different angles like in front, side, or back adds realism to your art. for the front and back angle, the circle is usually a perfect circle, while in side-view, it's an oval shape, because the flower is flat and not a sphere. Imagine a piece of paper in the shape of a circle; when you look in front, it's a perfect shape, but as you move or rotate it at the sides in different degrees of angles, it becomes an oval until it completely becomes thin in 90 degrees."
