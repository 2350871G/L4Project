If you don\u2019t have twine, you can also tear or cut the cardboard into small pieces that can fit in bins and bags. Bundles of flattened cardboard, newspapers, and magazines should be no more than 18 in (46 cm) high. Always use twine, not tape, to secure the cardboard bundles. Twine is more easily recyclable and eco-friendly than tape."

Outdoor bins must have decals on both sides and the lid so they can be clearly identified as well. Use green stickers for cardboard and mixed paper, and blue stickers for metal, glass, and plastic. Sanitation provides these decals for free, which you can order through their website. If you use bins, they must be leak-proof and durable, with tightly fitting lids."

Take your cardboard bundles, labeled bags, and bins out to the curb in front of the building and make 2 distinct piles: cardboard and mixed paper in one, and metal, glass, and plastic in another. Make sure to set all of your recycling materials on the curb, not the street. There\u2019s no limit to the amount of recyclables you can put out for collection, so stack your recycling materials as high as you need to. Putting your recycling out days ahead of time can block the street and come across as rude, so only put it outside the night before."
