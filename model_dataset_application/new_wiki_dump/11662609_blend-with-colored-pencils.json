      "description":"Press your colored pencil firmly against one corner of the paper part of one of your diagonal triangles to make a bold color starting from the corner. Be careful not to press too hard. Keep coloring with this bold color and near the middle of the paper. If you are attempting this for the first time, use two colored pencils that are within the same group, such as blue and green, to practice and work up to two completely different colored pencils as you practice more and more."

      "description":"The direction of your coloring should be forward and backward, toward the corner you started and toward the opposite corner diagonal of the corner you started. Be sure the differentiation between the value of bold to light color is smooth so that it doesn't look to choppy. Do this slowly and try to make the blending seem smooth."
