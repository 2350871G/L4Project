For example, you might get a loft bed with a desk underneath it if you want to create a study space in a small room. If you like a modern or minimalist look, you might choose simple furniture with plain lines and no adornments.

As another option, use a decorative floor lamp or table lamp to add more light to your room. You can look at different light fixture options at a local home improvement store or online. For instance, you might switch out a dome light with a pendant or chandelier for a glam or boho look. As another option, you could replace a ceiling fan light fixture with a plain dome light if you want a clean, minimalist design. If you prefer a lamp, pick a floor or table lamp that fits your style. For a minimalist look, pick a black, white, or silver lamp that will create clean lines. For a traditional style, you might pick a lamp with a nice wood or ceramic base.
