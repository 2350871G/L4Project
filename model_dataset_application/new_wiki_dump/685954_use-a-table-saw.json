Also, proper ear protection should be used because saw blades can be incredibly loud and hurt your eardrums. You can either purchase cheap, disposable earplugs or more sturdy earmuffs to protect your hearing."

          "description":"When cutting narrow, short boards, there may not be much clearance for your hands between the blade and the side fence. For this reason, you should use a push stick or a notched sled to help guide your wood as it gets cut. You can purchase these table saw pushing devices at hardware stores, online, or you can create them yourself. Some push devices will have adjustable parts for different sizes of wood."

          "headline":"Use clearance inserts.",
          "description":"If you are ripping really thin boards, you'll want to use an insert to protect your fingers from being close to the blade. An insert is a piece of wood that fits between the side fence and your saw blade and allows a buffer zone when cutting especially thin pieces of wood. In addition to using a clearance insert, you should also use a pushing device when cutting very thin boards."

If blade guard is no longer installed, purchase one from your table saw manufacturer, or re-install the one that came with the table saw originally. Many modern blade guards can be reattached to your blade by simply fitting it on top of the blade and tightening screws or plastic clamps."

Hold your board against the miter gauge fence. Use your right hand to pull the miter gauge handle and set the gauge to the back of the saw. Using your left hand, firmly hold your board against the edge of the miter gauge. Keep your fingers at least 6 inches away from the saw blade cover. The board should be sitting at a 90-degree angle to your blade on the miter gauge fence. Push the board through the blade. Push slowly but deliberately with your right hand onto the miter gauge handle and keep a firm grip on the board with your left hand. Push the miter gauge fence forward and cut your board. Pull back the board and turn off the saw. Once you've cut through your piece of wood, pull back the board to the starting position. Turn off your table saw, and you've just made a crosscut.",
