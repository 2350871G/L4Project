However, if you want to get some GX's for use in games and tournaments, then you\u2019ll want to be strategic about which Pok\u00e9mon GXs you get. Each GX has its one move that goes with a strategy in some way, so if you\u2019re getting some GXs online for battling, then you need to first figure out your what deck your building and what strategy it is using. Also, if you\u2019re getting GXs for gameplay, get ones that either have the same energy requirements as the cards in your deck, or that are evolutions of Pok\u00e9mon in your deck. It you want a common Pok\u00e9mon card instead of GX Pok\u00e9mon, you can go through this same selection process. Just note that GX cards have one special move that other cards do not have, making them more valuable. Plus, their HP is way higher than their normal form."

Checking for Fake GXs See if the card is shiny. All GXs are shiny. If the GX card looks dull, or not shiny, then it is fake. To make sure, though, compare it to a different GX card or, if possible, a GX card that is the same Pok\u00e9mon.

Misspellings in a Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s name are a quick and simple sign that the card is fake. For example: an error on the name of a Pok\u00e9mon, like Pikachu being spelled as 'Pekachu'. See if it bends easily. Be careful when bending, to avoid damaging it! Bend it only slightly. Once you've done that, take another GX card and bend that one. If that one is way sturdier than the other, then the other is fake. Observe the images on the back and on the front carefully. Sometimes, the images look uneven, or have uneven borders. This is a sign of complete fake. Also, look at the Pok\u00e9 Ball on the back. Then, get another card and compare the Pok\u00e9 Balls. The Pok\u00e9 Ball is supposed to have a dark-blue border. If one card is lighter than the other, then it is fake. Look for a thin sheet of black between the cards. All cards, including GX cards, have a black sheet between the cardboard layers.
