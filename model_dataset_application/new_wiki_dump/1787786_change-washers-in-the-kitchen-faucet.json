Once the screw is removed, gently wiggle the faucet's handle back and forth. Eventually, it should come loose. You can then pull out the handle. Not all faucets have a handle.

If the stem seems to be stuck, spray it with WD-40, wait 5 minutes, and try again. Some stems cannot be pulled out with pliers.
