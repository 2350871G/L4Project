          "description":"White or grey floors are good options for small kitchens with low ceilings. Light floors will reflect more light, which makes your kitchen look brighter. Light floors look quite nice with white or colored walls. Lighter flooring is especially popular for homes near the beach. These floors go well in many homes, though, as light neutral colors are incredibly versatile. Light colors also conceal scratches well and will fade less over time compared to dark colors."

          "headline":"Choose between light hardwood, laminate, porcelain, or vinyl flooring.",
          "description":"Each of these flooring options come in light, white, or grey tones. Visit a home supply store, and narrow your options based on personal preference and price. Laminate flooring, otherwise known as engineered hardwood, is an attractive, affordable option. Laminate costs about $1-6 (\u00a30.7-5) per square foot (square meter) uninstalled. It will cost about about $2-8 (\u00a31.4-5.7) per square foot (square meter) to install. Vinyl is an easy-to-clean and cost-effective option. Vinyl costs on average $1-5 (\u00a30.7-4) per square foot (square meter) and about $1-2 (\u00a30.7-1.5) per square foot (square meter) to install. Use hardwood floors for a timeless, durable kitchen floor option. Hardwood costs about $3-12 (\u00a32-9) per square foot (square meter) and about $5-12 (\u00a34-9) per square foot (square meter) to install. Go with porcelain tile for a durable, low maintenance floor option. Porcelain floors cost between $1-20 (\u00a30.7-15) per square foot (square meter) and about $5-10 (\u00a34-7) per square foot (square meter) to install."

          "description":"Tan floors are a good choice for traditional kitchens, especially if you have different colored kitchen d\u00e9cor. You can refinish existing hardwood or cork floors with a tan, natural shade of stain. Tan flooring is a good choice if you have natural colored cabinets or a tan countertop. Tan floors also look great with bold colored walls, like red or blue. Visit a home supply store, and purchase water-based stain in a shade of your liking. Apply the stain following the directions on the package. Remember, though, that the stain should tone your wood or make it darker. It is usually difficult and costly to stain dark woods lighter."

All flooring types can come in a tan or natural color, and you can make your decision based on your budget and style. Laminate and vinyl flooring are the cheapest options. Tile and hardwood can get pricey, depending on the quality and materials. Cork flooring is another option for natural colored floors. Cork flooring is a slip-resistant, eco-friendly floor choice. Cork floors cost about $2-6 (\u00a31.5-5) per square foot (square meter), and installation costs about $5-10 (\u00a34-7) per square foot (square meter)."
