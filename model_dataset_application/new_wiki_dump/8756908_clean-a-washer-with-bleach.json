          "description":"Most modern washing machines have a bleach dispenser drawer or compartment. Fill the drawer or compartment completely with bleach. Older models may not have a bleach dispenser. If this is the case with your washer, simply add between a half and a full cup of bleach directly into your machine's tub. If your bleach dispenser holds less than a quarter cup of bleach, you may want to consider using concentrated bleach. This will allow you to use the bleach dispenser but get the cleaning power of more bleach.

James Sears\t\t\tCleaning Guru\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: If your washing machine has a compartment for adding bleach to your clothes, you can use it to add bleach for cleaning the machine. Fill the compartment with bleach, then run the washer. After the cycle, run the machine a second time with only water to rinse out any bleach residue."
