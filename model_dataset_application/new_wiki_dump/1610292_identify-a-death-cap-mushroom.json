          "description":"Take a close look at the cap of the mushroom. The color of a death cap mushroom can vary based on its growing conditions. In general, though, the caps are off-white and can have tints of olive green, pale green, or yellow. Very old mushroom caps can become almost brown. The caps of mature mushrooms also often have 1 or 2 large cracks running across them.Note: The Amanita caesarea mushroom, which is perfectly safe to eat (although sometimes mistaken for a death cap), has a bright orange-colored cap. The caps of death cap mushrooms often have 1 or more patches of thin white veil tissue."

          "description":"Measure the cap while it\u2019s still growing in the ground without uprooting it so you don\u2019t kill the plant. Use a typical household ruler to measure its diameter. If you\u2019re dealing with a death cap mushroom, the cap itself will have a diameter somewhere between 3\u20136 inches (7.6\u201315.2 cm). It\u2019s safe to touch the mushroom directly without wearing gloves. The mushroom\u2019s toxins can only harm you if you ingest them. If you\u2019re foraging for mushrooms to eat, it\u2019s wise to err on the side of caution. If you\u2019re not sure whether or not mushrooms are death caps, leave them alone. Mature paddy straw mushrooms can have caps of a nearly identical size and shape, making them difficult to tell apart."

So, flip the mushroom\u2019s cap upside down (you may need to crouch down close to the ground) and take a look on the underside for gills. These fine gills are densely crowded together near the outer edges of the mushroom\u2019s cap and are very finely attached to the stem. The gill color is another way to distinguish a death cap mushroom from the Paddy Straw mushroom and other edible mushrooms. The Paddy Straw's gills are pinkish brown. Other mushrooms, such as those of the genus Agaricus, also have pink gills, although theirs turn brown as the mushroom matures."

          "headline":"Inspect immature death cap mushroom for a very rounded cap.",
          "description":"Tilt the mushroom back and forth to get a sense of the shape of its cap. In young mushrooms, you can observe a very rounded, bowl-shaped cap. These caps are sometimes so rounded that they curve around and nearly touch the stalk of the mushroom. However, as the mushrooms age and reach maturity, this convex shape flattens out. If you notice that the cap is nearly flat, you\u2019re dealing with a mature death cap.Note: Young and mature death caps are equally toxic. The amount of toxins in 1 mushroom is enough to kill an adult, and a few bites would be enough to kill a child or pet. Edible puffball mushrooms can sometimes look like death caps in the forest. The best way to tell them apart is to slice open the mushroom. If it has no gills, it\u2019s a puffball."

One of the death cap\u2019s most tell-tale signs is its tall, thick, white or yellowish stalk that elevates the cap above the forest floor. Death caps\u2019 stalks are often also covered with a light layer of fine scales. The stalk is typically a shade lighter in color than the cap itself.

The volva of a death cap mushroom can be fairly large, growing to about 4 centimetres (1.6 in) in diameter. The lower part of the mushroom\u2019s stalk, including the volva, is often buried in the soil around the tree it is attached to. The bulb may also break away or fall apart over time, so if it isn't present, the mushroom could still be an amanita mushroom. Paddy straw mushrooms also have a volva of roughly the same size. So, finding a volva isn\u2019t enough to guarantee that a mushroom is a death cap."

If you dig up and handle the death cap mushroom, you may inadvertently destroy this delicate skirt membrane.
