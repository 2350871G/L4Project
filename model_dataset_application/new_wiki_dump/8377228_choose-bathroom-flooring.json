It will also help you make decisions about what types of flooring you will use and how you will install it. Depending on the material, bathroom flooring materials can range in price from a little less than $1 to as much as $100 per square foot ($10.76 to $1,076 per square meter). Make sure to include the cost of labor in your budget calculations! If you opt to install it yourself, you could choose a more expensive flooring option."

Some materials handle moisture well, holding their original shaping and resisting warping. Others are better at conducting heat and keeping your feet warm. Ultimately, you will want a flooring that is durable and functional. Typically, avoid using wood flooring in a bathroom because the humidity can warp the wood.

Cheap flooring tends to need frequent cleaning and is more susceptible to damage. Some types of flooring need to be treated with chemicals regularly to prevent damage from moisture.

Vinyl sheeting is more difficult to install but better at keeping out moisture. Vinyl flooring is also warmer and softer than ceramic or porcelain tiles.

However, it can be rather expensive, with a starting price around $4 per square foot ($43 per square meter). One major drawback to linoleum is that it is susceptible to staining.

Cork flooring starts at $2 per square foot ($21.52 per square meter).
