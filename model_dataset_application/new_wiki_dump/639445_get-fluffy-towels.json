          "description":"There are multiple reasons why a fluffy towel can become stiff. However, one of the most commonly-cited reasons is the use of excessive detergent. Over time, the chemicals in detergents can build up in the fibers of the towel, making them stiffer and less absorbent. To avoid this, use a little less detergent than you're directed to use for each load. This makes it slightly easier for your machine to wash the soapy residue away with each rinse cycle. Don't be afraid to cut back on your detergent use. Odds are, you won't be left with dirty clothes \u2014 studies have shown that most Americans use more detergent than is necessary to get their clothes clean. An added benefit of reducing your detergent use is that you will also save money!"

To get the best results, you'll want to leave plenty of space in the washer for them so they can be properly rinsed and agitated. This means:\nUsing medium-small, manageable loads. Your machine should be about 1/2 full of loosely packed clothes. This goes for your dryer as well as your washer. Washing your towels on their own (without other clothes in the load). In addition to crowding the washer, clothes with things like zippers and buttons can wear the fabric of the towels."

          "description":"If your washing machine gives you the option to set different wash and rinse temperatures, use a hot wash followed by a cold rinse cycle. Many online sources recommend this. Hot water loosens the fibers of the towel and helps remove dirt, grime, and soap residue that can cause stiffness. Cold rinse water makes the fibers of the towel contract, making it less likely that they will \"clump\" together. Check the care label on colored towels before washing. Most whites will be safe for hot wash cycles, but hot water can make colored fabrics fade."

Luckily, there are several ways to avoid this problem:\nUse gentler settings in your dryer \u2014 lower heats and slower speeds\nAlternate between line-drying and tumble-drying.

The way you fold and store your towels can also have some effect on their texture. Try using the tricks below to help keep your towels fluffy. Use loose folds to prevent stiff creases in the towel's fabric. Alternatively, loosely roll your towels. One good folding method is as follows:\nHold your towel lengthwise (so that the short edge is pointing to the floor). Fold the towel in half to make a long, skinny strip. Loosely fold the towel into thirds. Fold one edge toward the center, then fold the other edge over the top and line up the edges so they form a tidy bundle. Fold the bundle in half once more and store the towel. Store folded towels side-by-side (like books) rather than in stacks. This helps prevent the bottom towels from being flattened by the ones above. If you're hanging towels from a rack, don't hang multiple towels on top of each other \u2014 this, too, can make the bottom towel stiffer."

The repetitive action of the ball circulating with the towels will gradually \"work out\" any stiff spots, leaving you with softer towels. Commercial dryer balls can be found online or at many major department stores for reasonable prices \u2014 usually no more than about $5 per ball.

If you want to do this, add about 1/2 cup during the first rinse cycle (using more for large loads and less for small loads). This helps pull the soapy chemical buildup and hard water deposits out of the towel's fibers. You should notice softer towels after just a few cycles. Only use white vinegar for this task. Other vinegars, like apple cider and especially balsamic vinegar, can stain your laundry."

As an added benefit, baking soda will also help remove odor from older towels. Note, however, that baking soda can fade bright colors. Many online sources recommend against using baking soda and vinegar at the same time. These chemicals will react with and neutralize each other (just like in the famous \"papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 volcano\" science fair project)."

When hard water is used to wash laundry, these minerals can build up and lead to stiffer fibers in the fabric of your towel. However, some \"water-softening\" products can reverse this effect. For instance, borax (sodium borate) is a safe, affordable laundry additive that can help reduce the mineral content in hard water and leave you with softer towels. Borax is available online and in the \"laundry\" section of most major department stores for cheap \u2014 rarely more than $5 for a small box."
