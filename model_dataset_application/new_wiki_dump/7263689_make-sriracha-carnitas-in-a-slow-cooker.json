      "description":"The carnitas are good as is, just in their own juices. However, if you want a little more flavor on the side, try a Sriracha-flavored mayo or a Sriracha sour cream. For the mayo, mix Sriracha, mayonnaise, and soy sauce, to taste. For the sour cream, mix about \u00bc cup of sour cream with \u00bd to 1 Tbsp of Sriracha."

      "headline":"Serve it up!",
      "description":"The carnitas go great in tacos. Warm up some corn tortillas in a frying pan, drop some carnitas in the middle of each tortilla, and add your preferred toppings. Try a little shredded cheese, some fresh chopped cilantro, a few slices of avocado, some sour cream, and some salsa or pico de gallo. If you really want to maximize the heat, add some more Sriracha!"
