  "text":" Making a 4-Point Snowflake Use a square piece of paper. If your paper is a rectangle, simply fold one corner across the paper so that two of the sides match up. There will be an extra rectangular flap that isn\u2019t part of the triangle that this creates. Cut this flap off and unfold the triangle. Fold your paper in half twice to make a small square. Fold it once lengthwise and once widthwise, in either order, to make a small square. Rotate your square. You want it to look like a diamond to you with the bottom point closest to you. Fold your diamond vertically along the middle. To do this, simply take the point on the right and fold it over to match up with the point on the left. Cut the edges. Cut shapes out of this triangle. Cut small shapes out of the edges to make intricate designs in your snowflake. Unfold your snowflake. Carefully unfold your paper to reveal your 4-point snowflake. It may not lay flat, so stick it, unfolded, into a book or in a stack of magazines for a couple of hours. Once it lays flat naturally, hang your snowflake in your window or around the house. Making a 6-Point Snowflake Begin with square paper. A good size to start with is an 8.5\u201dx11\u201d piece of paper. Cut the paper in half\u2014making the cut across the width rather than the length. Now from these two pieces, you want to cut squares. This will give you snowflakes that are 5\u201d across. To make a perfect square, simply fold one corner across the paper so that one of the sides lines up perfectly into an isosceles triangle. Trim the excess paper. Make a small triangle. Take your square and fold the bottom right corner to the top left corner to make a large triangle. Fold this larger triangle in half to create a smaller triangle. Fold your triangle into thirds. Place the point toward you. Take the top right corner and fold it straight across in the triangle. Instead of folding in half this time, fold it in thirds. Once you fold the right corner over, fold the left corner over as well. Your ending product should look like an upside-down cone with a small triangle missing from the top. If you have a protractor and want to be precise, each third will be a 30 degree angle. Cut your paper into a new triangle. With your paper folded in thirds, cut the top of the paper off at an angle.

Your snowflake is finished! If you want to make any adjustments after you unfold it, you can. If it\u2019s not sitting flat, put in in between the pages of a book or a stack of magazines.
