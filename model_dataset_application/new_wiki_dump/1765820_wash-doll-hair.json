For a Barbie doll, use a mild conditioner and gentle soap. For shampoo, it's best to use baby shampoo. If you have a doll with similar hair to a Barbie doll, consider using these products in that situation as well. If your doll is older and its hair is damaged, consider using a gentle fabric softener. This will help clean out the doll's hair and can also help restore its glow and softness. It can also remove odors that have built up in a doll's hair over time. In general, using mild products work best. Doll's hair is far more delicate than human hair, so a gentler shampoo or conditioner is ideal."

You should fill a small bowl or basin with as much softener as you need to coat the doll's hair. Place the doll's hair in the bowl and cover the hair until its soaked in softener. Then, let the doll sit for 20 minutes."
