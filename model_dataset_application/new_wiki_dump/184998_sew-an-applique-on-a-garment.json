Search for shapes online or freely draw a desired shape. Trace or draw your shape onto a piece of paper. Cut it out for use as a pattern. Attaching the applique Pin your applique pattern to the right side of your fabric. Place common pins along the edges of the pattern to hold it in place. Cut the fabric around the edges of your pattern and remove the applique.  Cut iron-on interfacing into the same shape as your applique.  Iron the interfacing to the wrong side of the applique.
