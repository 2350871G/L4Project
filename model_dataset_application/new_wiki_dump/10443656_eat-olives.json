Then simply use your fingers to pull the pit away from the meat of the olive. Discard the pit and enjoy the olive. If you\u2019re out at a restaurant or party, avoid this trick as the oils might squirt onto someone nearby, or the olive might go flying if you smash it at a weird angle."

Remove the fork from your mouth and place the pit on the side of your plate. Putting the pit between the tines keeps it secure while you\u2019re taking it out of your mouth.
