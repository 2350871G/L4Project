You can create a pile or use a bin for composting. So long as you create layers of a roughly 60/40 mix of brown (carbon-rich) and green (nitrogen rich) organic material, stir regularly, and keep the compost warm and slightly moist, the pile you start in the fall should be ready to feed your garden by spring."

The period between these dates is the average outdoor growing season where you live. Consult guides, websites, garden center employees, and neighbors for information specific to where you live. For instance, the first and last frost dates in Raleigh, NC are April 1 and November 4. But they\u2019re March 10 and November 19 in Jackson, MS. Most areas in the South have such long growing seasons that you don\u2019t need to germinate seeds indoors before spring planting. If you do start seedlings inside, be sure to put them in a window that gets at least 6 hours of sunlight every day."

Flat ground is also best, but uneven terrain can work if you terrace you plantings perpendicular to the slope. Pick a site that\u2019s close to an abundant water source. Putting your garden near your home, for instance, will help with watering and make it easier to keep an eye on any plant or weed growth, maintenance needs, and damage."

You can use home testing kits or probe-style pH testers to get a quick readout, or send samples out to a lab for a more detailed analysis. Every southern state has an agricultural extension program, and the local agents can advise you about unique conditions in your area. They will also test your soil samples so that you can add amendments (fertilizers) to your soil if needed. If you\u2019re a serious home gardener, you should test your soil every year before planting season."

Raised beds give you greater control over moisture levels as well, and provide a bit of extra protection against rabbits and other garden invaders. Garden beds shouldn\u2019t be more than 3.5 to 4 feet (1.1 to 1.2 m) wide, or you won\u2019t be able to comfortably reach the plants in the middle."

You\u2019ll also get a better idea of how much compost, topsoil, fertilizer, etc., you\u2019ll need. Size your garden based on the number of people who will actively work to maintain it. For a novice veggie gardener working alone, 100 square feet (9.3 square meters) \u2014 e.g., a 10 by 10 feet (3.0 by 3.0 m) square \u2014 is a good starting point."

Once cleared, till or hand spade your garden to a depth of 12 to 18 inches (30 to 46 cm). Work in compost and any soil amendments needed (based on your soil testing), and till the soil again to make sure these additions are worked all the way through the soil.

Consult the backs of your seed packages for the length to harvest for each plant. If you plant several rows of carrots, which have a long maturation date, you may not be able to use that space to plant more seeds later in the season. Note which vegetables you want to plant first, as well as where you want to plant successive crops. Consider the mature size of the vegetable.

The former will be harvested and gone before the latter are ready to pick. For instance, sow cabbage, carrots, and beets in the same rows as early peas and beans. You can also plant corn in between rows of potatoes, radishes in between rows of lettuce, etc. If space isn\u2019t an issue, keeping early- and late-harvest crops in separate areas will make weeding and harvesting somewhat easier, however."

Plant those in rows where they will eventually get some shade from taller vegetables, like tomatoes. If you plant taller crops on the southern edge of your garden plot, they will block more sunlight from reaching nearby shorter crops than if planted on the northern edge. Beyond the first year, your garden will do better if you practice crop rotation \u2014 planting different crops in different spots.

The mounds only need to be a few inches/centimeters high. After you\u2019ve cleared the garden plot, keep an eye on it through a few rain showers to see if water tends to puddle or the soil stays mucky. Some plants grow better with higher or lower mounds.

Consider saving rainwater in rain barrels so that you can use it throughout the year.
