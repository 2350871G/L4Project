  "text":" Preparing Colored Clothes For Washing Turn all dark and bright clothes inside out before you wash them. The majority of the fiber breakage will occur on the inside of the fabric, where no one will see. Clasp buttons, zip zippers and wash belts separately. These closures can be extremely hard on soft and colored clothing, so eliminate abrasion and fiber breakage by taking a few extra minutes to fasten up before each load. Separate black clothing, pastel clothing, bright clothing and white clothing into different loads. While you may already sort by the temperature (cold or hot), you can improve the brightness of your clothes by reducing the amount of off-color dyes the clothes come into contact with. Place delicates, belts and lingerie in a pillowcase or laundry sleeve. A bra strap wrapped around a delicate garment will break down fibers faster. Place blue jeans in their own washer load. Denim and other tough fabrics can cause more wear and tear on fibers. Just as you wouldn\u2019t wash your athletic shoes with lingerie, you shouldn\u2019t wash hard worn items with delicates. Washing Colored Clothing Purchase a high efficiency (HE) washer. Modern HE washers use a slow, longer tumbling action to wash clothes. Although any contact with the washbasin can be hard on fibers, it is gentler than the traditional agitator washbasin. Use a mild detergent. Purchase a detergent that is intended for HE washers. Fill it to less than the maximum amount, unless there is very heavy soil. Wash new bright or dark items separately on the first wash. You want to use a cold setting of approximately 60 degrees Fahrenheit (16 degrees Celsius) and the minimum level of mild detergent.  Choose a cold wash for all colored, bright and dark (separate) loads. Don\u2019t let the temperature rise above 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 Celsius). Most modern detergent brands are just as effective in cold water. Set your washer to the shortest cycle. Again, unless there is heavy soil, it will be enough to wash the clothes and prevent fading. If you have heavy soil in your socks, gym clothes or underwear, purchase an enzyme detergent. Wash these heavy soil items separately at 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 26 degrees Celsius).
