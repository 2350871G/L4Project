          "description":"For a smaller heating pad, use a mid-calf sock. For a larger heating pad, use an over the calf or knee sock. Use a sock that\u2019s 100% cotton. Choose a thick sock with a tight weave to protect your skin from the hot rice and to prevent the rice from seeping out. It\u2019s important to use cotton, because it won\u2019t burn or melt in the microwave. Make sure the sock material doesn\u2019t have metal threads in it, such as silver or copper, as these can ignite in the microwave. Don\u2019t use socks that have holes, as the rice will fall out. For a larger homemade heating pad, use a small pillowcase instead of a sock."

You could need anywhere between 4 to 6 cups (780 g to 1.17 kg) of rice, depending on the size of the sock. Leave a quarter of the sock empty so you can tie a knot in the top.
