For a monochromatic style, you can pick several shades of the same color. For example, a red house could be paired with a red door of a slightly different shade. For a light contrast, select a door color about 3 shades away from the color of your home, siding, or another exterior color. If you want complimentary colors, go for colors on the opposite sides of a color wheel. For example, choose a yellow door if you home is colored in a purple shade."

Make a quick drive through your neighborhood and check out other people's front doors. See if there are certain or color schemes that seem to be more acceptable. For example, you may notice red is a popular color in your area. If you see a lot of red doors, consider this color for your own front door. If you want to stand out just a little, pick something that fits with the color scheme but is unique. If most red doors tend to be very bright, go for a shade like burgundy."

For example, maybe the porch rails are painted yellow. You could make a yellow door to match to draw everything together. You could also look at the trim near your home. Pair a blue door with a blue trim. Or, match the color of your front door to the color of your garage door to tie everything together."

If your favorite colors would go well with your home, think about choosing one of your favorite colors for your front door. Make sure the color is fitting, however.

If your favorite colors are bright floral shades, like fuchsias and purples, this may not go great with a lighter green. However, a light pink is also a floral shade and would match better with a green house. If your home is done in muted shades, you might want to pick a high-gloss saturated color to make your door stand out. Or, pick a bold color in a muted tone to complement the other muted colors in your home."
