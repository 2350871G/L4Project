      "headline":"PROCEDURE",
      "description":"Some cultures used to make a fire inside a big hole. But the Araucanian make a fire outside the hole. There, they heat some rounded stones until they are red hot. Then, inside a big hole of more than 1.5 meter (4.9 ft) of depth lay the red hot stones. They can be carried with the spade. Over them, make a layer with half of all the collected leaves, to protect the food from the stones. Then, put the heavy food (cabbages, peeled potatoes and/or sweet potatoes and/or carrots) . Then the rest of it over the first layer. The idea is to make several layers that would all heat with the stones. At last, cover it all with the remaining leaves. Cover the leaves with some cloth that would protect it all from the earth. Now, cover all the hole with earth. The earth has to act as a heavy lid. So compact the earth. Now, take your time. You may have to wait for more than an hour. You'll know when it is well done, when you see some small strings of smoke coming from underneath of the earth-lid. As the stones as cooling down, there is no risk of burning your food. Finally, undo all the covering very carefully. Prepare your dishes! Although every food needs a special time to get cooked, the pressure of the earth makes them all cook at the same time."
