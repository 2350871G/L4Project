A short, heavy club that you can hold securely in one hand is ideal. However, almost any piece of hardwood with a decent amount of heft can be used as a baton as long as it's not hard enough to shatter your knife. Look for fallen branches and thick sticks that are tapered on one end to provide a convenient handle. Make sure the wood you select is as dry as possible. If it's too wet, it could dent or split when it starts to take a pounding. It's a bad idea to strike the blade of your knife with anything denser than hardwood."

Their irregular shape make it difficult to get a proper grip, as well, making them a clumsy and ineffective tool.

Once misplaced blow to the edge of the blade could cause it to snap. The deeper you can sink the blade initially, the better it will stay on course. When you're first wedging the knife, hit it at the base of the blade where the tang is the widest. Once you actually begin batoning, you'll want to switch your target to the tip section that's protruding out of the wood."

After a few good strikes, you should be able to cut clean through and move onto the next piece. Be careful not to strike the knife too hard. You just want to guide it down a few inches at a time. Don't rely on the baton to do all of the work. Without the pressure from your knife hand, the blade will move much slower."

If you're using a knife with a blade of 5 inches (13 cm), for example, you'll want to look for a piece of wood no more than 3 inches (7.6 cm) thick. Otherwise, there's a good chance that the blade might not make it all the way through. Inspect the wood to make sure it's a consistent width. It's easy to lose a short blade in a log that widens on one end (and a pain to get it back out).
