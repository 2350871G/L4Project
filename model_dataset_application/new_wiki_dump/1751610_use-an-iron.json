For instance, cotton responds well to high heat and steam, but some synthetic fabrics might melt or fuse if they're exposed to such temperatures. Do not use an inappropriate setting! Start with a low heat and work up. If you are ironing more than one item, start with the one that uses the lowest setting on the iron.
