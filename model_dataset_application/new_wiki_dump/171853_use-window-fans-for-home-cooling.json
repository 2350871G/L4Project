Visit your local hardware store or home-improvement store and look at their box window fan selection. While other types of fans, like circular rotating fans, are great for moving air around inside your home, they\u2019re less effective at bringing in air from outside."

          "description":"A larger fan will move more air than a smaller fan. Look for fans that will take up at least 2/3 of the horizontal width of your window frame. Make sure that the fans also fit within the lower portion of your window when the window pane is fully opened. Square fans aren\u2019t too expensive, so plan to pay $15-30 USD per fan. If you need to, measure the dimensions of your windows and take a tape measure with you to the hardware store so you can measure the fans as well. Avoid fans that are too large for the window. If you position them near the window and outside the window frame, they\u2019ll fall over."

It\u2019s best to have the same number of fans blowing in each direction. Bear in mind that setting up 2 or 3 smaller, less powerful fans is roughly equivalent to 1 large, powerful fan. If you have an uneven number of windows and can\u2019t have equivalent fans blowing inward and outward, it's better to have more blowing inward. This creates a slight positive pressure inside the home, which prevents dust and insects from coming in when the doors are opened."

If you\u2019re using fans during the day, position your outward-blowing box fans in windows located on the sunny side of the house. If you live in a single-story home, set up fans to blow inward on the shaded side of your home. Set the fans blowing outward in windows on the opposite side.
