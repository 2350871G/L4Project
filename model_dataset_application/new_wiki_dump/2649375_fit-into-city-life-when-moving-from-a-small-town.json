Moreover, large cities tend to create their own micro-climates and this can be disconcerting at first, until you learn to cope with additional heat from so much concrete, extra humidity, icy sidewalks or windy corridors caused by tall buildings and grid streets. Another thing that sometimes comes as a surprise is how cold shade thrown from tall buildings can make a street feel, especially in the mornings. Jot down and learn the average temperatures for January and July. January is usually the coldest month of the year in the Northern Hemisphere and hottest in the Southern Hemisphere, while July is the complete opposite (hottest in the Northern Hemisphere and coldest in the Southern Hemisphere). Plan on changing your wardrobe in order to adjust to your new location, depending on the seasons. Many places around the tropics do not experience the same seasons and weather patterns as those areas closer to the North and South polar regions."
