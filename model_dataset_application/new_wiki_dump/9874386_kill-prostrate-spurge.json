Spurge will usually take root and set seed after 5 weeks of warm weather. If you live somewhere cool and foggy, like some coastal regions, solarization may not work for you."

The water allows the sun's rays to go deeper into the soil in order to kill and prevent the spurge seeds from growing."

Anchor the corners with rocks or soil so the tarp does not come loose during wind or storms. Be sure you get a clear tarp so the sunlight can get through it. You can buy clear tarps at most home improvement stores and online. A black tarp will also work, since it will soak up the sun\u2019s heat and warm the ground underneath it."

Once you remove the tarp, you can resume gardening as you usually would in that area. Use caution when using this method, since any other plants that are already growing in the covered area will die."

Apply the herbicide following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions before the outdoor temperature reaches 60 \u00b0F (16 \u00b0C). Make sure to wear gloves and eye protection. If you're a home gardener, you will be able to buy pendimethalin, trifluralin, dithiopyr, and oryzalin. The other types are only available to landscape professionals.
