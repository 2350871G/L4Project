          "description":"For instance, you can paint the walls a neutral grey or cream, and then add throw pillows, blankets, pictures, and furniture to add bright colors. That way, you won't need to repaint every 3 years as your child's favorite color changes. Alternatively, try just painting an accent wall in your kids' favorite color. Then, when you repaint, you can just do that one wall."

          "headline":"Choose a subtle wallpaper if you want a pattern.",
          "description":"Patterns on the wall can be fun, but they are also easy to outgrow. Pick something that's fun, but doesn't feel too childish, like raindrops or constellations. Alternatively, try something more traditional, like plaid or a pretty floral pattern. Sticking to one accent wall can make this easier to change out. If you love the look of wallpaper but don't want to use it throughout the room, you can put wallpaper on just the closet door, only on one wall, or around your trim."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Try wall decals for an easy, inexpensive way to change up the walls.",
          "description":"Wall decals stick to the walls, but they peel off easily so you can change them in the future. In fact, some are big enough to take up the whole wall, making it easy to change the feel of a room. For instance, you could cover most of one wall with a map of the world or add decals of something your kid loves, like rainbows, unicorns, or skateboards. Another great option is to adhere a vinyl chalkboard to your child's wall, which your child can draw on. If your child has a habit of drawing on the wall, the chalkboard will provide an appropriate canvas."

          "description":"If you go for \"kid\" furniture, your child is likely to outgrow it in a few years. If you pick more grown-up furniture, you can always use it in the rest of the house if your child decides they don't like it. For instance, if you're starting with a baby's room, pick a grown-up dresser that can also function as a changing table. If you are buying a crib for a baby's room, choose a model that converts to a toddler bed and then a full bed. This will save you money as your child grows older and give the room a more grown-up look. Similarly, opt for a full or queen bed instead of a twin so your child can grow into it, if you have the space."

        {
          "headline":"Pick inexpensive items so you can replace them if needed.",
          "description":"Kids tend to destroy things. It's a fact of nature. Of course, you still want items to be sturdy, but when choosing things like rugs, don't throw a ton of money at it. Instead, pick something that's inexpensive enough that you won't mind if you need to replace it. Your kid is bound to spill something on it at some point. However, make sure any inexpensive pieces of furniture you choose, especially smaller items, won't tip over if your child messes with them. They may injure your child or break easily. Try thrift stores and garage sales for sturdy furniture that won't break the bank. When choosing furniture, consider the fabric. Pick hard-wearing fabrics like microfiber, ultrasuede, viscose, leather, or even an indoor-outdoor fabric like dyed acrylic."

          "headline":"Pull in furniture from other parts of the house to fill out the room.",
          "description":"You don't need to buy brand new furniture and accessories to complete the room. Take a rocker from the living room and put it in your kid's room, for instance, or move a nightstand from another bedroom into your child's room. If the item doesn't quite look right in the room, try upholstering it or repainting it to help it match better."

          "headline":"Put in shelves for display that your child can change over the years.",
          "description":"Every kid's room needs storage, and display shelves are a great place to start. Plus, they can change with your kids' taste, as long as you start with a fairly neutral color. Make sure you hang the shelves high enough that your child can't reach up and pull items off. For example, you can put stuffed animals or bright toys on them when your child is younger, then they can change them out for other things as they grow, such as unicorns, airplanes, books, guitars, skateboards, and so on."

For instance, include roll-out drawers under the bed, bins in the closet, and functional furniture with storage throughout the room. Other great options include a lidded hamper, storage baskets, or a storage cube with small baskets in the cubbies."

For instance, if your kid loves unicorns, add a few figurines, unicorn sheets, and throw pillows with rainbows on them. If your child doesn't know how they want their room decorated, you could use their favorite colors instead. This will help them feel happy in their space and give you a blank canvas for adding more decor when they're ready to choose a theme."

You could get a few paint sample cards from a home improvement store to help them decide, while efficiently limiting their choices a bit at the same time. For instance, if your child loves pink, you could pick out a few pinks that wouldn't be too outrageous on a wall for your child to choose from."

Pick out 3 you love, and incorporate those across the room, such as a one in the rug that matches the pillows, and then another in the bedspread that matches the curtains. Also, the patterns should look like they belong together, even if they don't technically match. For instance, blue stripes and a floral pattern can look like they belong together if the colors are complementary."

Use the brackets that come with shelves to stabilize these pieces of furniture. If the furniture doesn't come with brackets, you can buy them at a hardware store.
