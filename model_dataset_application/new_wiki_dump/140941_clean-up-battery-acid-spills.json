          "description":"Battery leaks can contain caustic chemicals that irritate the skin, lungs, and eyes. Always wear rubber, nitrile, or latex gloves before you handle the leaking battery or the leaked material. Wearing safety goggles or a face mask is highly recommended when handling car batteries or lithium batteries. Work in an area with good ventilation, blowing away from your face. If you feel a burning sensation in your eyes or on your skin, or if the spill gets on you, leave the area and remove affected clothing. Rinse in lukewarm, gently flowing water for at least 30 minutes. Acid leaks, typically from a car battery, are much more dangerous than alkaline battery leaks."

Smaller batteries that slot into electric devices are more varied, so examine the label to find the type. The most common types for small batteries are alkaline, lithium, and nickel cadmium, followed by lead-acid. Size and shape alone are not reliable identification methods."

Lithium battery voltages can vary, but are often written as multiples of 3 to 3.7. Nickel cadmium voltages are multiples of 1.2, and lead-acid batteries are multiples of 2."
