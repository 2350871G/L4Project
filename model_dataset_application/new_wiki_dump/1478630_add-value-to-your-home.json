          "description":"Cleaning the outside of your home will make it look much nicer and will add value to your home. One option for cleaning home exteriors is to use a pressure washer which sprays water at an incredibly high velocity and works well to clean exterior surfaces. Another option for cleaning the outside of your home is to use a hand-pump garden sprayer filled with a mixture of water and oxygen bleach (not chlorine bleach). Simply spray it on, let it soak for ten minutes, and then rinse it off with water from the garden hose. Some people prefer this method over power washing because the high intensity water spray from the pressure washer can get in cracks where it doesn't belong, can kill plants and other landscaping, and can erode wood and siding over time. To deep clean the interior of your home, make sure you focus on things like dusting the baseboards and ceiling fans, changing the air filters, scrubbing the grout in your showers, and cleaning out the fireplace if you have one."

New carpeting or high quality laminate flooring are also options. Opt for natural colors and materials that go with everything. Finish the flooring (whether it is carpet, laminate, or hardwood) so that it is in prime condition and add throw rugs for a little color and warmth if it gets cold in the winter."
