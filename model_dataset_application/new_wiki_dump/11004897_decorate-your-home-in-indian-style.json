          "description":"Avoid light shades and pastel colors. Instead, choose colors like red, turmeric, marigold, blue, green, ochre, jade, deep purple, and other vibrant hues. In any given room, it\u2019s okay to mix-and-match contrasting colors, like marigold and red, or you could choose to stick with one predominant color. Try to limit yourself to 3 predominant colors at the most. Steer clear of black and gray\u2014in India, they convey evil and negativity, which is definitely not something you want to bring into your home. Colors always signify something in Indian culture. For example, green is a very festive color that communicates happiness and peace. Yellow signifies learning, competence, and knowledge. Do some research to figure out what your favorite colors mean!"

Inlay work is also very popular in Indian decor, so pick pieces that have mirror, ivory, metal, or stone inlay work. The more ornate and detailed a piece of furniture, the better.Tip: For a traditionally Indian room, opt for heavy pieces made of solid wood. This will add to the ornateness and opulence of a room."

Multiple kinds of fabrics and textures for pillows, throws, tapestries, tablecloths, and runners will make your space emphatically more Indian in style. Kantha: a style of embroidery that patches together multiple pieces of fabric. Bandhani: a style of dyeing clothes with intricate, small patterns. Batik: a style of dyeing clothes that utilizes drawing on fabric with wax then dyeing the clothes and removing the wax to reveal the pattern. Cotton and silk are the most common fabrics used to make Indian textiles."

Pick paisley patterns, mandalas (intricate, symmetrical flower designs), or nature-focused prints that feature birds, animals, or flowers. The tiger is India\u2019s national animal, the peacock is the national bird, and the lotus is the national flower. If you\u2019re struggling to find inspiration for a room, visit a fabric store and see what kinds of colors and patterns catch your eye.
