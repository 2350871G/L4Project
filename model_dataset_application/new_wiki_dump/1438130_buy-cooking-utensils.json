          "description":"Mixing bowls are a great staple to have in your kitchen, and you can use them for so many different things! From mixing up a batter for cookies or tossing veggies in olive oil and seasoning, you\u2019ll find yourself reaching for these bowls regularly. Consider the different types of bowls for your own needs:\nPlastic: these are inexpensive and won\u2019t break easily, but they can sometimes absorb odors and oils from the dishes you prepare. Stainless steel: you can buy a set of nesting stainless steel bowls for about $30, and they\u2019ll last for a very long time. Glass: can double as serving bowls and are often able to be safely used in the microwave and oven. Ceramic: these are more expensive, but they usually look a lot nicer than the other kinds of bowls. They can chip easily, though, and they\u2019re very heavy. Copper: these are fashionable and effective but you have clean them after regular use. If you can, get a set of bowls that comes with fitted lids. This makes it a lot easier to store prepped foods and leftovers. Look for mixing bowls online or at your local home goods store. You can also often find sets at thrift stores\u2014just make sure to clean them thoroughly before you use them."

          "description":"You could either buy a prepared set of pots and pans from a specific brand, or you could choose each item piecemeal and create your own unique set. It\u2019s worth it to invest in nicer pieces so that they\u2019ll last you a lifetime rather than getting the most inexpensive options. Whichever way you choose to go, make sure to get the following for your basic cooking needs:\nStainless steel skillet: to sear meats and cook sauces; use with acidic ingredients, like tomatoes and vinegar (the stainless steel won\u2019t react with the acidity). Stainless steel stockpot: to make soups, stews, and chowders. Nonstick skillet: to cook eggs, fish, and other dishes that might easily stick to the pan (like a grilled cheese sandwich or a quesadilla). Cast-iron skillet: to cook meats and caramelize vegetables.Tip: Invest in a splatter guard to help keep your stovetop clean. It\u2019ll catch pops of grease and sauce and keep them off of your stove, definitely minimizing how much you\u2019ll have to clean up later."

You can bake cookies, roast vegetables, and make many other dishes on baking sheets. Line your baking sheets with parchment paper to make cleanup that much simpler. After your dish is out of the oven, you can just throw away the parchment paper and wipe down the baking sheet without having to scrub away baked-on food. You can find baking sheets online or at your local home goods store. If you aren\u2019t a professional baker, there\u2019s no need to spend more than $10 to $20 for a set of sheets."

Lasagnas, casseroles, roasts, enchiladas, and lots of other delicious dishes can be easily cooked in a baking pan. Never use a glass pan to broil meats, as they are more likely to shatter.

They\u2019re larger pieces of equipment, so make sure you have a space for one on your counter. If you aren\u2019t ready to commit to the price of a stand mixer, try a hand mixer instead.

You can buy a can opener from $10 to $30, depending on what kind you decide to buy. Manual can openers take up a lot less space and can be used even when there is no electricity. They cost less than electric can openers. An electric can opener is a little bit faster and removes the lid for you so it doesn\u2019t fall down into the can. Keep a colander or strainer in the kitchen for pasta and vegetables. A colander is really helpful when you have a pot full of liquid that needs to be drained away. You can also use it to easily rinse off fruits and vegetables or to drain canned foods. Stainless steel colanders will last a long time. Plastic ones are inexpensive, but they\u2019re more likely to get misshapen if they accidentally come into contact with a hot burner or pan. A colander is an item you can buy once and use for the rest of your life. Sur La Table and Williams-Sonoma both make stainless steel options for about $30 to $40. It\u2019s worth it to make the investment for a piece you\u2019ll use for years to come. Add more cooking utensils to your kitchen as you learn to cook. Many cooking and baking tasks can be accomplished with the tools you already have, but there are gadgets made for every kind of situation to help make them a little bit easier. Consider these other cooking utensils:\nPotato masher: used to crush cooked foods, like potatoes, beans, and apples. Grater: used to grate cheese, vegetables, garlic, ginger, and citrus peels. Garlic press: used to quickly mince garlic. Immersion blender: used to puree soups. Citrus press or juicer: used to extract juice from lemons, limes, and oranges. Mandolin: used to slice vegetables and potatoes into thin pieces.",
