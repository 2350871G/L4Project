          "description":"Sizing your pizza down from a large to a medium or small makes a huge difference when it comes to calories and portion control. Downsizing is an easy way to be healthier when you\u2019re ordering a family pizza\u2014this way, everyone can have the same number of slices, but with a healthier calorie count! For example, going from a large to a medium pizza can save you around 80-90 calories per slice."

          "headline":"Choose the thin crust option to cut down on calories.",
          "description":"Rather than stuffed, deep-dish, pan-style, or even regular crust, opt for a thin crust. This can cut out about 60-80 calories per slice, which adds up quickly! You can also request a whole wheat thin crust if the restaurant offers that option. Skipping white flour is much healthier because you'll be getting more fiber."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Choose tomato sauce over high-calorie and high-fat sauces.",
          "description":"Avoid unhealthy, sodium-heavy options like alfredo or buffalo sauce. Order a red sauce instead, such as a simple tomato sauce or a hearty marinara. If the restaurant offers more than 1 variety of red sauce, check the nutrition information to see which one is healthier. For example, Domino\u2019s Robust Tomato Sauce is healthier than its marinara sauce, since it contains less fat and saturated fat."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Ask for no cheese or reduced cheese.",
          "description":"If you don\u2019t mind a cheese-less pizza, this is your healthiest option. Otherwise, ask for less cheese to reduce the sodium and fat. Odds are, you won\u2019t even miss the extra cheese! Many pizza places even offer a low-fat cheese option, usually with 33% less fat than the normal cheese. Request this option if it\u2019s available, then ask for either the regular amount of cheese or a reduced amount. Avoid all double, triple, and 5-cheese options. You can save 100 calories per slice just by ordering regular cheese over triple-cheese. Skip out on sprinkling parmesan cheese on top of your pizza to cut down on even more calories."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Skip the dipping sauces to cut out unnecessary calories.",
          "description":"High-calorie dipping sauces may taste good, but they can rack up calories quickly. Instead of ordering ranch or a garlic butter dipping cups, eat your pizza sans extra sauce. If you really don\u2019t want to forgo dipping sauce, try a healthier alternative, such as a Greek yoghurt ranch dressing. You can save around 200-250 calories by skipping the garlic or ranch dipping cups."

Some popular options include spinach, fresh tomatoes, broccoli, mushrooms, bell peppers, and red onion. Vegetables give you more nutrients and help you fill up, while adding fiber and minimal calories to the pizza. For example, you could order a veggie-loaded pizza with red bell pepper, spinach, onion, mushrooms, tomatoes, and black olives."

Protein will raise the calories count, but it\u2019ll also keep you feeling full, so you won\u2019t be as tempted to overeat. For example, you could order a pizza topped with grilled chicken, sliced tomatoes, mushrooms, and onion."

This way, you\u2019ll only need to eat 1-2 slices of pizza and still feel full! If you take your pizza home, you could also make your own salad or eat a side of fresh carrot sticks, broccoli, or cucumber slices. To make the meal even healthier, opt for a lower-calorie salad dressing, such as balsamic vinaigrette, over ranch or caesar dressing. Eat your salad before you dig into the pizza to fill up on veggies first!"

          "description":"If veggies aren\u2019t your favorite, go for some fresh fruit instead! Oranges, apples, grapes, or watermelon make great side dishes and can satisfy any dessert cravings with their natural sweetness. Since most pizza places don\u2019t offer this option, you\u2019ll likely have to purchase and prepare your own fruit sides."

You should also avoid sodas that claim to be zero-calorie or sugar-free, since they can contain potentially harmful artificial sweeteners."
