Slats are typically available in 1\u201d, 2\u201d and 2.5\u201d widths. Prices for blinds can range widely, from $70-$120 for an average window size of 36\u201d wide by 60\u201d tall.

These are safer options if you have small children who might pull on cords. You can also choose blinds that resemble shutters from the outside of the window. Some blinds have rounded corners while others have square corners."

          "description":"Blinds can be mounted on the inside of the window (inside mounting), on the outside of the window on the wall (outside mounting), or on the ceiling above the window (ceiling mounting). Determining the best positioning for the brackets will depend on style preference as well as wall material that may affect the ease of bracket installation. Hold the blinds against the window to ensure they will fit properly for your preferred positioning. Inside mount: The blind slats are measured to fit inside the frame of the window and the mounting brackets are placed inside the top of the window frame. Outside mount: The blinds are measured to overlap the window frame and the mounting brackets are installed on the wall above the frame. Ceiling mount: The blinds are measured to overlap the window frame and the mounting brackets are installed on the ceiling directly above the window."

Use a level to ensure the marks are even and so that the blinds will hang evenly. Consult the instructions that came with your blinds kit for exact specifications, as they vary by manufacturer. If you are using inside mount blinds, hold the head rail up either flush with the wall inside the window jamb, or hold it back closer to the window."

          "description":"The best choice of anchor to secure the mounting bracket will depend on the type of wall you have. For drywall and plaster, use drywall anchors to hold in the screws. For brick or concrete walls, use masonry anchors. To install anchors, predrill a hole that is a suitable size for the anchor at the spot where you need the mounting bracket screw to go. Push the anchor into this hole until it is flush with the wall. For heavier blinds, you will need more secure brackets and wall anchors that can handle the extra weight."

You can move this support bracket 2-3\u201d to either side of the middle if its center placement interferes with the mechanics of your blinds.
