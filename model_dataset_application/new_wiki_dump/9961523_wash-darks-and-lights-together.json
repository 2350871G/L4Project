Lower temperatures will keep the dye in clothing and prevent bleeding, while also stopping the clothing from shrinking. In addition, 75 percent of the energy used to do a load of laundry comes from heating the water. By washing your clothing in cold water, you\u2019ll save money on your energy bill."

The shorter the wash cycle is, the less chance there is that the dye from darker clothing will bleed onto lighter clothing. Never stuff your washing machine completely full. The washing machine needs room for water, and cramming it full of clothing could lead to leakage."

          "description":"If clothing is new, the dye on the fabric is still fresh, making it easy for water to cause the color to bleed. Whenever you buy new colored clothing, wash it separately from light clothing at least once before adding it to your laundry. If you buy new white or light clothing, however, it won\u2019t matter if you mix them together, as light and white clothing won\u2019t bleed onto dark clothing. You can also place the new colored clothing in a bucket of soapy water for half an hour to see if the color runs. If it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s alright to place it in a load with your lights."
