          "description":"If a nuclear attack on your region or city is imminent, the local and national news media will be reporting on the event. Also pay close attention to any ballistic-missile warning systems that may broadcast a warning across radio, TV, or even though text messages. Hawaii's ballistic-missile-threat system is a good example of this type of warning. Even 5\u20137 minutes of warning before the blast will provide enough time for you to take steps that will save your life."

Enter the building as soon as you hear the siren, even if you suspect that it may be a drill and want to be sure that the alert is real. Make your way to a central room and stay there. If you're planning for a nuclear war weeks or months in advance, make a plan regarding how you'll get yourself to a large, secure building within 5 minutes of a bomb warning."

Stand or sit in the middle of the room and wait for the bomb to hit. Locating yourself away from exterior windows and walls will decrease the amount of radiation you receive."

A large wave of radiation will sweep outward from the bomb location. This radioactive fallout will take several minutes to arrive at your location. So, stay indoors (preferably still underground) where you'll be relatively safe from the radiation. If you step out within the first few minutes after the blast, the radiation wave is likely to kill you."

While you must stay inside for 30 minutes after the blast, after that time has passed, you can quickly relocate yourself to a larger, sturdier building if there's one within \u20444 mile (0.40 km). Again, seek out a central room or basement away from windows. Once you're in a safe, sturdy building, stay there for up to 24 hours."

You'll also receive information regarding parts of the city that are heavily radiated and should be avoided. If you don't have a radio or phone with you, try to find a public building that would have a phone or TV."

Use masking tape to tape the plastic bags up on the inside of your home's windows. Taping plastic on the inside of the windows will protect you should an air blast from an atomic bomb shatter the glass and send shards flying inward.
