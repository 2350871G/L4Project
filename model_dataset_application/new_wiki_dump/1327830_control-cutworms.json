Most gardeners don't know they have a cutworm problem until they see evidence in the morning after a night of feasting has occurred. By then, there's no telling how many worms are in the garden. Catching the population before it explodes will help save your garden. Here's what to look for:\nPlants cut off near the base of their stems. Plants that are wilting or damaged. Cutworm droppings. Cutworms themselves, which you can find by overturning the soil with your hands in the vicinity of the damage. They can be many different colors, including grey, brown, pink, black, and so on. Some are spotted, some have stripes, and some have no markings."

If you place barriers around the stems, the cutworms have a much more difficult time accessing the stems. Cut 4-inch pieces of cardboard, plastic, or another firm material cut in the shape of a tube to serve as collars for your plants. You could also use cardboard tubes or metal cans with the ends removed. The downside to collaring is that every single stem will need its own collar to keep the cutworms away. If you have a large garden with hundreds of plants, you may need to combine this method with others so you don't spend your whole summer fashioning little plant collars."

The cutworms won't be able to climb the surface of the cardboard and metal or scoot in underneath the bottom. If you cut out the collars from cardboard or plastic, make sure the seam is securely taped so that there's no gap for cutworms to crawl in."

Then, cut a slit in each piece lengthwise and slip the straws over the plant stems. Poke the ends beneath the surface of the soil. Alternatively, you can wrap each stem with a piece of cardboard, thick paper or aluminum foil, taking care to push the sleeve below the soil."
