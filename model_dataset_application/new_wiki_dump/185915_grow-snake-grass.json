As long as it gets a bit of sun, it\u2019ll have all it needs to grow. You may want to consider building a retaining wall to prevent it from growing out of control.

Lay fine mesh at the bottom of the container to protect the drainage holes. Planting snake grass in a container will help prevent it from spreading too wildly.
