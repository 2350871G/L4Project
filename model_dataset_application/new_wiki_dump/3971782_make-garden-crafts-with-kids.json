The soil should be suitable for plants to grow in; make sure it's not too acidic. Shape the pure loam into a golf-sized shape ball using water to make it pliable and insert the seeds into each ball as you go, or sprinkle seeds in prior to shaping balls if easier. Method 2: Use semi-dry, living compost (not sterilised) and powdered red clay. Mix one part seed mix, three parts compost, and five parts clay. Shape into a round ball with your hands, adding enough water to make it pliable. It should have the consistency of cookie dough. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/28\\/Make-a-Seed-Bomb-Step-3Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Make-a-Seed-Bomb-Step-3Bullet2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/28\\/Make-a-Seed-Bomb-Step-3Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Make-a-Seed-Bomb-Step-3Bullet2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nMethod 3. Alternatively, save up small biodegradable cardboard cartons, such as egg cartons or find biodegradable netting, such as old cotton stockings. Fill the egg cartons with the preferred soil and seed mix as above methods outline. Pinch the tips over so that the contents won't fall out. With stockings, you can fill them with a seed and soil mix, then twist, tie and cut them out much like you'd do if you were making sausages. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/d\\/df\\/Make-a-Seed-Bomb-Step-3Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Make-a-Seed-Bomb-Step-3Bullet3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/d\\/df\\/Make-a-Seed-Bomb-Step-3Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Make-a-Seed-Bomb-Step-3Bullet3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nMethod 4. Mix sawdust on a ratio of 5 parts sawdust to 1 part seed with a rapidly biodegradable, non toxic and preferably food safe glue and a small amount of seaweed extract. The mix should not be wet, but moist enough to form a ball. It's better to make this version in small batches. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/56\\/Make-a-Seed-Bomb-Step-3Bullet4.jpg\\/v4-460px-Make-a-Seed-Bomb-Step-3Bullet4.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/56\\/Make-a-Seed-Bomb-Step-3Bullet4.jpg\\/v4-760px-Make-a-Seed-Bomb-Step-3Bullet4.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"

  "text":" Garden markers Make markers for plants so that you know which plants are growing. These could be for a flower garden, herb garden, veggie patch, or a special ornamental garden. It would be good to match making the markers with the child's interest in a particular part of the garden. Make markers from pebbles. These are easy to make and can be very colorful additions to the garden. Select paint that is suitable for outdoor projects. It needs to be able to withstand what the elements will throw at it. Also find suitable markers that can withstand outdoor use. Choose suitable pebbles or stones. The main feature is that they are smooth and there is enough surface space for writing on the name of the plant and adding a little decorative flair. Craft stores and garden stores will often sell bags of river stones or large pebbles; these are perfect. Otherwise, hunt around in the garden; with your kids, of course! Clean the surface of the pebbles. If the pebbles were sourced from the garden, wash them in warm, soapy water, to remove dirt. Allow them to dry fully before painting. Lay a protective surface down for painting. Arrange the paints and the pebbles in readiness for painting. Ask the kids to decide which plants they want to make markers for. It can be a good idea to write down a list of the plants, so that none of the plants are forgotten. If the kids are too young to do the writing, you'll need to do this part. Get painting. Paint the top and sides of each of the pebbles. There is no need to paint the bottom, as this will be resting in the soil. Be sure to choose a variety of colors for the painting; this is a lot more interesting for the kids than a single color. Allow the first layer to dry completely. Then paint another layer for good measure. Allow that layer to dry before decorating the pebbles. Use either a glass paint marker or a Sharpie marker to write the plant names onto the pebble markers. Allow to sit for at least one hour, so that the writing dries and will not smudge off. Add decorative elements. Use different colors of paint to paint on patterns, such as dots, circles, hearts, leaves, etc. It could be as simple as making a straight line border or as complicated as drawing a picture of the plant itself; this will depend on the age, talent and interest of the kids. Allow to fully dry. Paint a clear coat over each pebble. This provides the final layer of protection. Allow to dry overnight. Head out into the garden the following day. Place the painted pebble markers in a carrying container and ask the kids to place them in the soil next to or in front of the plant that the marker was made for. Take a photo of your proud kids. All done! Wash a food-grade plastic container thoroughly. This could be anything from an ice cream container to a yogurt pot. Leave the container to dry.  Draw a stencil of the marker shape. A picket fence shape is best, with a flat end for the top and a pointed end to pierce into the soil. Trace around the stencil all around the plastic container. Fit in as many as you can so that you can make the most of the container. Cut the labels out using a strong pair of scissors.  Write the plant names on each label with a permanent marker that will not erase when watered or rained on.  Use by piercing the soil with the pointed end. Be sure it is in far enough so as not to blow away. Choose a pot piece for each specific plant. Since each plant may take up a different amount of space, you'll want to customize the marker for each plant\u2019s size. Write the plant name around the top of the pot piece. Make sure it's written clearly so that you can read the name. Consider using a stencil to create uniformity.

Try a few positions before deciding where it sits best (don\u2019t embed the pot deeply into the soil until you are sure you like the location). Done! Golf ball ladybugs Gather a bundle of old or new golf balls. If using old golf balls, wash them well and allow to completely dry before using. Use paints that are suitable for outdoors. You'll also need primer paint and some sandpaper. Ask the kids to sand the golf balls. This roughs them up enough for the paint to stay stuck to the balls. Apply primer paint to the roughed up surface of the golf balls. You might need to do this step, depending on the ages of the kids. If using spray primer, ensure that you're working in a well-ventilated area. Allow to dry completely. Paint each golf ball completely red. Allow to dry, then apply another coat for completeness. Allow the second coat to dry. This forms the ladybug's body. Paint the face of the ladybug. Choose one side or \"end\" of the ball to be the ladybug's face. Paint a black circle here. Paint a black line from the top center of the black circle to what is now the back of the ladybug. This forms the division between the ladybug's wings. Dot paint three dots on each side of the line. This forms the standard ladybug spots. Allow all the black paint to dry. Repeat for each golf ball.  Add the ladybug's eyes. Decide where her eyes will sit and paint two small white dots on the face. Allow to dry completely. Then, using the tip of a pencil, dot in to small dabs of black paint for the pupils. Allow to dry completely. Paint each finished ladybug ball with a clear coat to seal and protect the little creations. Allow to dry overnight. Next day, have the kids go into the garden space where you'd like the decorations to be placed. Have them place ladybugs on the soil, in plant containers, on rocks, or wherever else you've deemed appropriate. They look good grouped together or in a line. Seed bombs Buy or harvest your seeds.

With stockings, you can fill them with a seed and soil mix, then twist, tie and cut them out much like you'd do if you were making sausages. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/d\\/df\\/Make-a-Seed-Bomb-Step-3Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Make-a-Seed-Bomb-Step-3Bullet3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/d\\/df\\/Make-a-Seed-Bomb-Step-3Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Make-a-Seed-Bomb-Step-3Bullet3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nMethod 4. Mix sawdust on a ratio of 5 parts sawdust to 1 part seed with a rapidly biodegradable, non toxic and preferably food safe glue and a small amount of seaweed extract. The mix should not be wet, but moist enough to form a ball. It's better to make this version in small batches. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/56\\/Make-a-Seed-Bomb-Step-3Bullet4.jpg\\/v4-460px-Make-a-Seed-Bomb-Step-3Bullet4.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/56\\/Make-a-Seed-Bomb-Step-3Bullet4.jpg\\/v4-760px-Make-a-Seed-Bomb-Step-3Bullet4.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Allow the seed bombs to dry out for 24 hours. Arrange the seed bombs on a dry tarpaulin or on sheets of newspaper laid out in a sheltered area such as a shed. Here they are ready for use. Plant the seed bombs. If you have a plot with rows already dug for planting, install a ball every few feet (meters), (or as recommended by the seed producer), then cover over with existing soil. If you are looking to re-vegetate open space with grass or tree seeds, just throwing the seed balls will create a more random, realistic landscape, then bury them sufficiently to retain the moisture for the seed. If you'd rather store the seed bombs for a bit, keep them in a cool, dark, and dry place for no longer than several weeks. It is best to use them when fresh though, as the seeds might begin to sprout! Watch for the growth. If made correctly, the seedling will be visible within 2-3 weeks, or quicker in warmer conditions. The process doesn't really speed up germination time dramatically, but when the seedling starts growing it has ample nutrients directly at its roots so will grow quicker and more healthily. Fairy houses See How to make a fairy house for one approach to putting a fairy house together.  Make a fairy house from basic unwanted food containers. You'll need a cup (or a mug) and a bowl, some markers, paint and any other decorative items (optional). You'll also need some glue suitable for ceramics. The bowl and the cup can be purchased from a thrift store if you don't have old ones at home to spare. The paint must be suitable for ceramics. Check the the bowl sits in a nicely balanced way over the cup or mug before proceeding; it must be a good fit. Paint the bowl and the cup or mug. Paint the bowl one color and the cup or mug another color. Allow to dry fully, then paint another layer for a smooth look. Allow to dry. If needed, paint one more layer for good measure. Add decorative paintwork to the cup and bowl. For the bowl, paint large round circles in a different color at varied intervals across the bowl. These will appear like mushroom spots when the fairy house is put together. For the cup or mug, paint a door and two windows. The door should be centered away from the handle and begin from the open end of the cup or mug. Attach the two pieces together to make the fairy house. Carefully glue the bowl (open end facing down) down onto the solid end of the cup or mug. Allow to dry. This forms the little fairy house. Decorate a little more. If wished, you can twist a piece of artificial plant around the handle to cover it up. A small chimney could be glued on; use a small block of wood (paint it first). Other decorative elements can be glued on, such as pieces of lace for curtains, etc. Varnish or clear coat the entire house. This will provide a layer of protection for the fairy house. Allow to dry overnight. The following day, place the little fairy house in the garden. Let the kids decide where it's best placed.",
