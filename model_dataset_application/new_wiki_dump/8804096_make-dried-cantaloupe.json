Cut slices at half inch intervals to create long, thin cantaloupe strips. Do this with each eighth of the cantaloupe. If you\u2019re unsure about where to start cutting, you can use measuring tape to guide your blade."

Note that trays will vary in shape and size depending on the dehydrator you\u2019re using, which might limit the amount of slices you can dry at one time.

If you live in an area where the temperatures easily reach or exceed 100 degrees Farenheit (38 Celsius) and it\u2019s not too humid, you\u2019ll be able to dry your cantaloupe slices in the sun. Cover a cookie sheet in cheesecloth and place the cantaloupe slices atop it. Then leave the whole thing outside in direct sunlight. Turn the fruit slices over once a day so they\u2019ll dry evenly. Bring the tray in at night to avoid dew forming on the fruit. It should take two to four days for the cantaloupe slices to dry completely. You may want to check the forecast to guarantee a sunny period of four days before attempting this method. You can protect drying fruit slices from insects and birds by covering them with a bug screen or cheesecloth."
