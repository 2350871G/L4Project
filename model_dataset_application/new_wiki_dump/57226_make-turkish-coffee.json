If you're working with whole beans that must be ground, measure 2 heaping teaspoons of beans for each coffee. Arabica beans are most often used for Turkish coffee, and Kurukahveci Mehmet Efendi is among the most popular brands."

You can use a Turkish coffee mill if you have one, or use the finest setting on an electric grinder. You can also grind fresh beans at the grocery store, and many of these grinders have a Turkish coffee setting. Properly ground Turkish coffee beans will look like soft cocoa powder. Because the beans must be so finely ground, many people purchase pre-ground Turkish coffee blends."
