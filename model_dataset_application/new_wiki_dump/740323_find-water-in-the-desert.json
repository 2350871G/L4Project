          "description":"Dense vegetation and most trees cannot survive without a steady water source. If you are unfamiliar with local vegetation, aim for the greenest plants you can see. Deciduous and wide-leafed trees are typically a better sign than pine trees, as they tend to require more water. If you can identify local plants, see below for species to look for. In North America, look for cottonwoods, willows, sycamores, hackberry, salt cedar, arrow weed, and cattails. In Australia, look for desert kurrajong, needle-bush, desert oak, or water bush. Keep an eye out for mallee eucalypts, or eucalypts that grow with multiple stems emerging outward from the same underground tuber."

This means a north-facing canyon if you are in the Northern Hemisphere, or a south-facing canyon in the Southern Hemisphere. Find these with a topographical map if you have one, or eyeball the surrounding landscape. Snow or rainfall is more likely to be retained in these cooler canyons, sometimes for months after a major rainstorm."

It's usually about 2 ft (0.6 m) in diameter, with long spines that end in a curve or hook. It may have red or yellow flowers at the top, or yellow fruit. It grows in drainages and on gravelly slopes. Cut off the top of the cactus with a machete, tire iron or other tool. Mash the white, watermelon-like interior into a pulp and squeeze out the liquid. Minimize the amount you drink.
