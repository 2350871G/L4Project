This program can detect any copy protection method that might be used by your disc. This is only necessary if you are using Alcohol 120%, as Alcohol 120% asks you for the protection type before ripping. If you are using CloneDVD or ImgBurn, you don't need to identify the copy protection."

Not all ripping programs require AnyDVD to be running, but it will make the process much more likely to succeed. AnyDVD is a paid program, but you can use the trial version to make your copies. You don't need this for Alcohol 120%. Instead, use the copy protection identification step above. AnyDVD runs in the background and you don't need to do anything to get it to work."

Most modern drives support this, though you may run into issues on older computers. Philips, Lite-On, and Plextor drives are the best for copying games, and nearly all models support RAW DAO. If your drive doesn't support this mode, then you will likely need to install a patch later on in order to play the game."

If you are using Alcohol 120%, ensure that you have determined the correct protection method that the disc uses. Insert the disc, click the Create Image (or similar) button, and choose the correct drive from the image ripping software. Set a location for the image. When the disc is ripped, an image file is created on your hard drive. This file will be the same size as the disc, so make sure your hard disk has enough free space. If you are using Alcohol 120%, select the copy protection method in the Datatype menu. Lower the read speed. Copying a game with protection software is tricky, and ripping it too fast can cause errors. Set the ripping speed to 4X or lower to ensure that no errors occur during the ripping process."
