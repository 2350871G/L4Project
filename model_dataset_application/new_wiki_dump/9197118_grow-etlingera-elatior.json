Water these flowers frequently if rainfall is inadequate for keeping the soil moist, but ensure it doesn\u2019t become waterlogged. If your area gets so much rain that the leaves are dropping and the soil is waterlogged, simply dig a trench near the etlingera elatior to direct water away from the roots of the plant."

However, if you happen to notice either a grasshopper or aphid infestation, apply neem oil to your plant to eliminate the pests. Neem oil is incredibly effective and won\u2019t harm birds, bees, or butterflies. You can also purchase a package of ladybugs at your local garden shop and gently sprinkle them onto your plants to rid them of aphids. Another way to rid your garden of grasshoppers is to spray a botanical insecticide, like organic pyrethrins (also found at your local garden shop), on the plants."
