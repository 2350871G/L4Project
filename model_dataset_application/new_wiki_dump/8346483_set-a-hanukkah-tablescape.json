          "description":"As the title \u201cFestival of Lights\u201d suggests, the most exalted Hanukkah tradition is the ritual lighting of a new candle for each day of the celebration. The menorah itself will be your most important decoration, and should assume the central position on the table so that it commands the most attention. Let a different member of the family light one of its eight candles every night. Ordinarily, the menorah is placed in front of a window or in sight of the front door so that it can be seen from outside. Start your own tradition of using a menorah that\u2019s a family heirloom."

          "headline":"Burn scented oils.",
          "description":"Oil also has an important history with Hanukkah, as it was used to keep the candles lit and purify the temple in Jerusalem after it was reclaimed. Carry on tradition by placing small bowls or basins of olive oil at either end of the table. This way, you can purify and invite blessings into your own home. For a more modern touch, you can set up scent diffusers to incorporate oil into your Hanukkah decorations while also filling the room with pleasant fragrances. Make sure the oils you use are permissible under kosher laws."

          "headline":"Place a few dreidels around the table.",
          "description":"The dreidel is as much a symbol of Hanukkah as the menorah. In historical times, these simple spinning toys were made by Jewish children, who used them to amuse themselves during holiday festivities. Include a dreidel with each place setting on the table so everyone can have a little fun once dinner has concluded. Many dreidels are inscribed with words, numbers or symbols, allowing you to use them to play games for special prizes. Bring the beloved toy to your table in the form of dreidel-shaped napkin rings or candle holders."

          "description":"The six-pointed symbol represents the Jewish people and their beliefs. As one of the key images of the Jewish faith, it can often be found in the foreground of major celebrations. Proudly show off the Star of David on your dinnerware, clothing or in standalone decorations. You can also craft your own Star of David decorations by creatively arranging different materials. The Star of David serves as a visual reminder of the covenant that exists between God and the Israelites."

Fried foods are in keeping with the holiday\u2019s oil motif and call to mind the single jar of oil that miraculously lit the Jewish temple for eight full days. This is one of everyone\u2019s favorite parts of the celebration! Take a look at recipes for favorites like latkes and sufganiyot. Have a special dessert like rugelach ready to cap off a delicious meal."

The gifts are usually simple and small enough to fit at each of the table\u2019s place settings. Though it\u2019s not a hard and fast rule of celebrating Hanukkah, exchanging gifts is a good way to get in the giving spirit. One time-honored Hanukkah gift is gelt, or chocolate coins wrapped in shiny metallic foil. Nowadays, families can give clothing, jewelry or even gift cards."

Set out a lavish runner as the focal point of the table, or fashion handmade name cards to go at each guest's seat. The possibilities are nearly endless!

Arrange these accents directly over the table or pin them up them in the background and enjoy the occasion in style.

The essence of the holidays is to extend love and kindness to those who are dear to us, regardless of whether or not they share our faith. Non-Jewish friends and relations are often more than welcome to join in celebrating the holiday. Many people convert or marry into the Jewish religion, meaning that there can be a mixture of religious traditions within a single family."
