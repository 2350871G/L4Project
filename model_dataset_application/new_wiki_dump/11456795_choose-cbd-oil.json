          "description":"Since CBD oil is still being tested, tell your doctor what you plan on taking it for and ask them if it will work for you. If you suffer from seizures caused by Lennox-Grant syndrome or Dragnet syndrome, your doctor may prescribe a CBD oil capsule. Otherwise, if you want to take CBD oil for pain or anxiety, your doctor may be able to give you recommendations on what to choose. Side effects of CBD oil may include dry mouth, drowsiness, fatigue, reduced appetite, or diarrhea. CBD oil may cause negative interactions with blood thinners."

          "description":"While CBD oil is meant to help your body relax and ease stress, too much at once can make your symptoms feel worse. Look for CBD oil products that have 250 mg concentrations so you can see how it affects your body. As you get more comfortable using CBD oil, experiment with low doses at higher potencies, such as 500 mg or 1,000 mg, to see what they feel like. The concentration will be clearly listed on the packaging so you can identify the oil\u2019s potency. Every person will have a different level of tolerance for CBD. While you may be fine with a few drops of 500 mg oil, another person may require multiple drops or a higher concentration to feel the same effects. Some studies have found that some CBD oil products have a lower concentration than what\u2019s listed on the packaging."

Check the label or package of the oil for testing information so you know if it's safe to use. If you don\u2019t see any testing information or confirmation on the package, the oil may have contaminants that could give you adverse long-term effects.

Read the label on the back of the CBD oil product that you\u2019re interested in and look for an ingredient list and a break down of their percentages. If you don\u2019t see any ingredients listed, the product may be low-quality and you should avoid it if you\u2019re able to.
