          "description":"Each section will be equal to 1 head length, which is the length of your person\u2019s head from top to bottom. Generally, adult figures are 8 head lengths tall, so marking this on your paper at the beginning will help you keep the proportions of your drawing right. Draw horizontal lines to divide up the vertical line, and keep in mind that the top horizontal line will be the top of your person\u2019s head and the bottom line will be the bottom of your person\u2019s feet. If you want to draw a child, divide the vertical line into fewer head lengths since children are generally shorter than adults. For example, use 3 head lengths for a toddler, or use 6 for a 10-year old."

Don\u2019t worry about making the shapes precise yet since this is just a rough sketch. The outline of the head should fall within the top head length section. The outlines of the person\u2019s body and arms should start in the second head length section and extend down to the fourth section. The outlines of the legs should take up the lower 4 head length sections."

At this point, you can start adjusting the proportions of the body to make it look more masculine or feminine, depending on what you\u2019re going for. If you want to draw a person with masculine features, broaden the shoulders, chest, and waist, and also take in the hips so they\u2019re narrower. In general, use more angular lines as you define the outline of your drawing. To draw a person with feminine features, narrow the shoulders and chest area, and broaden the hips and thighs. Try to use rounder, softer lines to outline your figure."
