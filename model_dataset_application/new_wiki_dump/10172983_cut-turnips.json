Try to peel short strips rather than long, to avoid getting caught on any bumpy knots in the skin. Peeling is necessary for older, larger turnips, however if the turnips are very young, you don\u2019t have to peel them. If they are golf ball sized, this means that they are small enough to not need to be peeled. If the turnip skin is very thick and tough, you can always wait until after chopping to peel each slice. Using a paring knife rather than a vegetable peeler will make this easier too."

          "description":"Hold the turnip with one hand, and make a careful, steady cut with a chef's knife. This creates a flat surface to rest the turnip on the chopping board. A chef's knife which is 8 - 10 inches (20 - 25 cm) is best for slicing through turnips safely. Removing the bottom of the turnip also removes the hairy roots, which are often found at the base of the vegetable. The base of the turnip is often thicker and isn't generally eaten anyway."

Be careful to make sure that the knife doesn\u2019t slip, and slice it firmly through the turnip to create halves. Using a chopping board rather than a plate, as well as a recently sharpened knife, will make chopping up the turnip safer and easier."

          "description":"Lay each half flat on the chopping board, and slice into semicircles that are around \u00bc to \u00bd an inch thick. You can continue cutting them into cubes if needed, or just leave them sliced. To further chop up the turnip, cut each semicircle in half lengthwise, and then into thirds or quarters depending on the size you prefer. Grating the turnip is also an option. You can use a food processor or hand-held grater to do this. For roasting, cut the turnips into wedges. For mashing the turnips, cut them into eight pieces."
