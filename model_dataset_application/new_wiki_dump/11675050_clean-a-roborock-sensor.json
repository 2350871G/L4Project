If the sensors are particularly dirty and a dry cloth isn\u2019t helping, you could try using a slightly damp cloth to wipe down the sensors. However, this could potentially damage the sensors and void any warranty you have on your vacuum, so proceed with caution."

They\u2019re each about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long and they\u2019re reflective. Different models of Roborock vacuums may have slightly different layouts.
