          "description":"If you\u2019re going to be watering your garden with a hose, make sure the spot you choose to start planting is reachable by the hose. Avoid choosing a spot in your yard that collects water when it rains\u2014you want well-draining soil. You can always use a watering can to water your plants as well. To find out if your soil is well-draining, dig a hole that's 1 foot (0.30 m) deep and 1 foot (0.30 m) wide. Fill the hole with water and time how long it takes to drain\u2014if it takes less than 30 minutes, the soil drains properly. If your soil is of poor quality, you can buy nutrient-rich, well-draining soil at a garden store or online."

          "headline":"Use a shovel to loosen rocks and soil before planting.",
          "description":"You want your soil to be soft and broken up enough for roots to be able to flourish. Use a shovel or rake to loosen the soil so that it's not caked together, digging into the soil in all different directions. Remove any particularly large rocks from the area. Loosen the soil to about 1 foot (30 cm) in depth."

          "headline":"Amend your soil with nutrient-rich compost.",
          "description":"You can buy soil at a gardening store that is well-draining and rich with nutrients, if desired. You could also add in your own compost if you've started creating some. Spread the rich soil evenly throughout your planting area. Create a layer of soil or compost that's at least 4 inches (10 cm) thick. If your soil is made up of heavy clay, till the compost into the soil to improve drainage."

          "headline":"Plant seeds or young plants in squares instead of rows.",
          "description":"Divide your garden into squares to create a grid, measuring each square to be 12 by 12 inches (30 by 30 cm). When you go to plant the seeds, read the back of the package where it says something like \u201cspace after thinning\u201d to find out how far apart to spread the seeds in the square. For example, if your lettuce seeds need to be 6 inches (15 cm) apart from one another to grow properly, divide your square into 4 sections and put a seed in the middle of each section. Planting in squares instead of rows will help conserve energy and space since the seeds are planted closer together."

          "description":"You may have a great grid system for your garden, but make sure you plan out a way to reach all of your plants. You\u2019ll want to easily water, prune, and check up on them without trampling on other plants. This is more important for larger gardens. If you can reach the middle of your garden by standing on the outskirts, you don\u2019t need to design pathways in the middle. The pathway just needs to be big enough for you to walk\u2014how wide you make it is up to you."

          "description":"Some plants love shade and will dry out if they\u2019re in constant direct sunlight, while other plants need lots of sun to thrive. Consider each plant\u2019s sunlight needs when deciding where to place them. For example, you can place a plant that likes shade under a taller plant that loves the sun\u2014the taller plant will provide a shadow to rest in for the shade-loving plant. Plants that need full sun should be planted in a spot that gets at least 6-8 hours of sunlight a day."

          "description":"Planting too many plants before you know what you\u2019re doing will leave you feeling overwhelmed, and your plants might not thrive as well. Start off with a small garden of 2 or 3 different types of plants, learn how to grow these, and expand your garden later on. A small garden will make watering and maintenance much easier. You can plant as many of the 2 or 3 types of plants as you'd like\u2014you might start off by planting 5 or 6, or plant the entire seed packet, depending on how much space you have available."
