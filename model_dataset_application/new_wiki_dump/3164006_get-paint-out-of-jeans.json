The first thing to do in the case of a water-based paint stain is to add some warm water to the affected area. Dab a washcloth in some warm water and press it gently against the stain, letting the warm water soak into the jeans fabric."

          "description":"Once you have let some warm water soak into the stained area, it should be ready for some real cleaning. Add one tablespoon of laundry detergent to half a cup of water and stir. Once the two have mixed into a consistent solution, rub some of it onto the stain with your damp washcloth. Rub the stain in a gentle circular motion; if the stain is sufficiently big, begin rubbing the outside perimeter of the stain and gradually work your way inwards. Rubbing as such will minimize the risk of spreading the paint stain around further."

If that is the case, using an Isopropyl rubbing alcohol solution and dabbing it on the stain should work towards lifting the paint away from the fabric. Nail polish remover works too as an alternative to traditional rubbing alcohol, but may prove damaging to fabric. If you're at all concerned whether it's going to leave a stain of its own, do a test scrub of the nail polish remover on a part of your jeans that won't be easily seen, such as the inside or the bottom of a pant leg."

Use some more rubbing alcohol and apply it to the stain if you're not yet getting the results you'd like."

If the paint stain you're tending to is already dry, you can remove at least some of the mess by taking a knife to the surface material. Scrape a blunt knife along the surface; in doing so, you'll hopefully get the excess that wasn't able to latch itself directly onto the fabric.

While paint removers are the most effective antidote for paint stains, they're not promised to be safe for use on clothing. An oil solvent is your best bet; they're relatively inexpensive and can be bought at any supermarket or arts store.

Use a toothbrush if you think the washcloth isn't working as well as it should be. If you think a heavier-duty chemical is needed such as industrial paint remover, it's a good idea to test the chemical on an innocuous part of your pants (such as the inside of bottom pant leg) first before moving in to solve the stain.
