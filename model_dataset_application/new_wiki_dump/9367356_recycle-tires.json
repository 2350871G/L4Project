Simply screw 3 metal eyebolts into the top of a used tire (and secure them with washers and bolts on the underside), spaced evenly apart, and loop a piece of sturdy rope or metal chains through the eyebolt holes. Find a sturdy tree branch in your yard to hang the swing from. You can screw 4 metal brackets into the top of the tire if you want to make it even more secure."

For plants that require a lot of sun, be sure to choose a sunny spot for the tire. Fill the inside of the used tire with dirt and potting soil, then plant some flowers inside. Be sure to water the plants regularly. You might also want to consider painting the outside of the tire so that it looks nicer in your yard or garden. A green color would work well for this to blend in with the plant theme. You can even get extra fancy by wrapping the outside of the tire in old yarn or rope."

Let the paint dry, then position it outside in your yard. Purchase several bags of sand from your local home improvement store and fill the inside of the tire with the sand. Make sure you put down some plastic first, otherwise you\u2019ll get sand all in your yard if you ever want to get rid of the sandbox.

Once the paint has dried, you should stack the tires, one on top of the other, and use some firm adhesive glue to connect the top and the bottom tires. After this, you can glue a table top to the uppermost tire. You can use a piece of wood, slate, or glass as the garden table top. Alternatively, you can make a decorative flat-top garden tire table by gluing a round piece of wood (the same size as the interior hole of the tire) inside the tire, and then gluing rope around the exterior."
