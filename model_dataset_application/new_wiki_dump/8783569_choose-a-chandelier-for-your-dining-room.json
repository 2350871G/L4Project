Record these dimensions so you can refer to them later when browsing different types of fixtures. Measure the room in feet and the light fixture in inches. One helpful guideline is to add together the room\u2019s length and width and pick out a fixture with an equivalent measurement. For example, a chandelier for a 20 by 25 feet (6.1 m \u00d7 7.6 m) dining room should therefore be no larger than 45 inches (110 cm) in diameter. Take into account the height of the ceilings as well. Choose a larger chandelier if you have vaulted ceilings, and a smaller piece if you have lower ceilings so it doesn\u2019t overwhelm the space."

Since you can\u2019t try out different chandeliers it will help to stick closely to the measurements you took down. In the end, you may have to eyeball and use your best judgment.

If you\u2019re attempting to brighten a larger area, opt for a model that features multiple bulbs or reflects light in many different directions. The chandelier you settle on should enhance visibility without being harsh or glaring. You also have the option of choosing between conventional bulbs and powerful LEDs that give off more light in a smaller space. Connect your chandelier to a dimmer switch so you\u2019ll have full control over the amount of light it gives off. If the chandelier doesn\u2019t provide enough light in the space, hang wall sconces or put a lamp on the buffet table."

For a more organic setup, have your chandelier measured, lined up and hung in relation to the position of the dining table, not the other way around.

Try suspending the fixture at different levels until you find one that allows the eye to transition seamlessly from floor to ceiling. A good rule of thumb is to find the height of your ceilings in feet or meters, then multiply that number by 3 and convert it to inches or centimeters: for example, a dining room with a 9 feet (2.7 m) ceiling will accommodate a chandelier up to 27 inches (69 cm) high. Chandeliers are generally mounted to hang 30\u201336 inches (76\u201391 cm) from the top of a table or other surface. Make sure that the light doesn\u2019t shine in your eyes when you\u2019re sitting at the table, but don\u2019t put it so high that it\u2019s not noticeable in the room."

Otherwise, it can bleed together with nearby ceiling lights and floor lamps, resulting in a washed out glare. Find a sensible spacing between individual lights so that no part of the room is either too bright or too dark. If you\u2019re using a lighted chandelier, turn off some of the surrounding lights so they don\u2019t end up competing. Chandeliers comprised of lots of small crystal or glass pieces are designed to diffuse light with a sparkling effect, which means they often don\u2019t even need an integrated light source."
