Some weed killers will only target specific styles of plants, so determine which types are present in your rock beds. Broadleaf weeds, like dandelions and ragweed, can be targeted separately with a broadleaf killer without damaging any other grasses. Grassy weed killer will target Bermudagrass and others, but it is not selective and will your lawn if it comes into contact with it. Sedge weed killers will help take care of crabgrass and is specific to this type of weed. Most plants like this form from bulbs, so it may take multiple sprays to fully remove them. Non-selective sprays will kill everything they are applied to. This will also include plants that you have planted and your lawn, so use non-selective spray sparingly."
