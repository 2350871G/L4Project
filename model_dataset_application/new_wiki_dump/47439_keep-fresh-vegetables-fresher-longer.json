Keep bagged lettuce mix crisp and fresh by slightly dampening a piece of paper towel, tucking it over the top of the leaves, and then clip the bag closed. The lettuce will remain crisp for at least a week or more. Make sure the paper towel is not too wet. If it is, just replace with a fresh paper towel. After slicing a tomato or onion, place a folded paper towel over the cut edge and either wrap in plastic or place in zippered sandwich bag.  Fresh clean carrots can stay crisp if closely wrapped in a plastic bag to prevent evaporation or stored in an airtight container. They can last up to a week longer rather than go rubbery. Potato, onions, ginger, garlic and sweet potato (kumara) should be stored in the dark (or an opaque bag) as sunlight makes them sprout and inedible.
