Once the area is clean, you can see what needs to be done. Rodents can carry some nasty diseases (Hantavirus for one, but it is rare) so you may want to wear high-quality respiratory protection."

      "description":"Thoroughly examine for any opening 1/4\" or larger. Close off any crawl space doors with an actual door instead of a casual closure such as a piece of wood pulled over an opening. You can stuff small openings with steel wool. Medium openings can be bridged with 1/4\" hardware cloth (mesh) stapled over the opening. Make sure to check where plumbing, electric and heating enter and exit your house."

      "description":"Fill or bridge gaps where the house meets the ground to prevent entry. You should safely get up on the roof prepared to fill holes where vents exit the roof and where two roof lines intersect. Bring along hardware cloth and fillers as used in the crawl space. This is important because arboreal rats have no problem jumping on to the house, moving in, and finding their way to your generous supplies of food, water, heat, and shelter."

The material used is made of a flexible rubber,which is vulnerable to chewing by mice and other rodents. Rodents chew through the lower corners to gain access to their new home. A flexible metal strip can be secured to the garage door weather seal where the seal meets the ground. The garage/ home will then be better protected against pesky rodents sneaking inside."
