If the diode is reverse biased, then the reading on the meter should be infinite resistance, which means the diode is open. A lower resistance for either type of diode means the diode is shorted and needs to be replaced. In either of these cases, you should replace your diode. If you see no reading at all, make sure the leads are securely clipped onto the diode. Check if your leads are functioning properly by testing them on a brand new battery. Set the multimeter to voltage mode and attach the red clip to the positive end and the black clip to the negative end. If the reading doesn't match the voltage of the battery, you need new leads."
