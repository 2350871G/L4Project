          "headline":"Soak the rice for 20 minutes.",
          "description":"Put the dry rice in a large mixing bowl. Run warm water in the sink, then add enough warm water to the bowl to cover the rice. The precise amount isn't important. Set aside for 20 minutes. This softens the rice for a slightly quicker cook time and draws the starch out for a better texture. While you wait for the rice to soak, you can save time by preparing the rest of your ingredients (e.g., chopping your onion, measuring your spices, etc.) and proceeding through the next few steps."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Toast the seasonings in oil.",
          "description":"Heat the oil in a large, steep-sided saucepan or pot over medium heat. When the oil is hot (drops of water in the pan should sizzle instantly), add the cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, cloves, and cumin seed. Let these ingredients cook for about a minute as you stir them frequently. \"Toasting\" these ingredients will help release their flavor for a tastier, more aromatic final product. Your goal isn't to char or fry these ingredients, so stir often."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Brown the onion slices.",
          "description":"Add the chopped onion to the pan. Stir to combine with the seasonings. Let the onion sautee in the pan, stirring about every minute or so. Cook the ingredients together for about 10 minutes. The onion is ready when it reaches a pleasant brownish color with crisp, semi-blackened edges. It should be soft to bite into and shouldn't have the bitter \"bite\" of a raw onion. The time it takes to get to this stage can vary depending on your stove, so keep an eye on your pan."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Drain the rice and add it to the pan.",
          "description":"Once the excess water has been removed from the rice, stir it in with the other ingredients. The rice will still be damp and will sizzle when it is added. Stir frequently to prevent burning or sticking. Continue like this for a few minutes to \"toast\" the rice. To drain rice, you will want to use a fine mesh colander or strainer. Don't use the sort of colander you'd use for pasta \u2014 the rice will fall through the holes. In a pinch, you can even use a clean coffee filter. The rice may turn an opaque white color as it toasts. This is normal. You don't want it to turn brown, however. This is a sign that it is burning."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Add water and salt.",
          "description":"After a few minutes of toasting the rice, pour the water into the pan along with a few pinches of salt. Increase the heat slightly to bring the water to a boil."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Simmer, covered, for 15 minutes.",
          "description":"Stir the ingredients in the water a few times to combine, then cover the pan with a lid to keep the heat in. Reduce the heat to bring the water to a gentle simmer. Let the rice cook undisturbed for about 15 minutes or until it reaches your preferred texture (see below). As the rice simmers, it will gradually absorb the water and grow softer. Basmati rice is generally best when it is fairly soft and fluffy, which usually takes about 15 minutes. However, if you like it firmer or softer, you may want to stop the cooking process a few minutes on either side of this."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Let the rice sit in the pan.",
          "description":"Turn off the heat. Let the rice sit undisturbed for about five minutes. The rice will continue to cook and absorb some of the moisture. At this point, most (or all) of the water should be gone from the pan. If the rice is still firm or crunchy, it's not done yet. Add a little extra water to the pan (if none remains) and simmer for another 10 minutes. After this, let the rice sit for five minutes as normal."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Fluff and serve.",
          "description":"When rice finishes cooking, it settles to the bottom of the pan, taking the shape of the container. Stir the rice up with a fork. This is referred to as \"fluffing\" the rice. It will give the rice more volume and allow any inner moisture to evaporate more easily. About a minute after fluffing, the rice is ready to serve. Scoop portions onto serving plates. It should cling to itself somewhat, so it can be eaten with a fork or spoon."

          "headline":"Toast the rice in a pan.",
          "description":"Pour a teaspoon or two of oil into a wide, steep-rimmed pan. Warm over medium heat for a few minutes until hot (a drop of water should immediately start to \"dance\" and sizzle). Pour the dry rice into the pan and stir to coat with oil. Spread the rice out into a single layer. Let the rice cook for about 10 minutes this way, stirring frequently. As the rice toasts, it should gain an opaque white color \u2014 it will look almost pearly. If it starts to turn brown or black, you're using too much heat or not stirring enough. This technique brings out the naturally nutty flavor of good basmati rice and improves its texture. You should be able to smell the former as the rice cooks."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Add the ingredients to a slow cooker.",
          "description":"Remove the toasting rice from the heat. Pour the rice into a slow cooker (e.g., crock pot, etc. ), then add the lentils, broth, bouillon, chopped onion, and seasonings. Stir a few times to combine. If you like your rice somewhat spicy, at this point, you can try adding a dash of cayenne pepper or a generous pinch or red pepper flakes to give the mixture some heat. Paprika is another good choice for its easy flavor."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Simmer for 4-5 hours or until soft.",
          "description":"The convenient thing about this recipe is that it doesn't require much work from you. Simply set the slow cooker to medium heat and let the ingredients cook for several hours. Different cookers will cook the meal at different rates. After about an hour and a half, you can carefully remove the lid and test the rice and lentils for texture. Both should be soft and smooth. If either has a stiff or crunchy texture, let the mixture cook for another forty minutes before trying again."

          "headline":"Alternatively, use a pressure cooker.",
          "description":"Though they aren't as common as they once were in the US, pressure cookers are commonly used in Indian cooking. They are cheap, easy to use, and work similarly to slow cookers. The most important thing to remember when using a pressure cooker is that they work much faster than slow cookers and that you must allow the high-pressure steam to dissipate before removing the lid. See below for instructions:\nAdd the ingredients to the pressure cooker. If you have an electric pressure cooker, set it to high pressure. If you have a stovetop pressure cooker, set it over high heat on the stove. When the meter indicates it has reached high pressure, reduce the heat to low. Let the mixture cook for 6 minutes at high pressure. Turn off the heat and let the cooker sit for 10 minutes. The contents will continue to cook. After this, release the rest of the pressure with the valve and remove the lid."

One easy example is curry, a spicy stew-like dish that is usually associated with India. Serve it in its own bowl with the rice on the side or spoon it over the rice and let the rice soak up the juices \u2014 it's up to you.

Try laying the main dish over a generous bed of rice so you get a little of each in every bite. A delicious, nutritious Indian favorite you may want to try this with is tandoori chicken. A good vegetarian option which uses greens and cheese is Saag Paneer."

Making nut-and-raisin rice is easy \u2014 just add about 1/2 to 3/4 cups of each when you start cooking the rice in liquid and stir. Continue cooking the rice as normal. Halved cashews and chopped almond slivers are especially good choices, though other nuts like peanuts can also work well."
