          "description":"This is the first, and most basic, observation you can make about someone\u2019s handwriting. To determine what size the handwriting would be classified, visualize the paper you might have learned to write on as children. It is lined paper, with faint mid-lines down the center of each line. Small letters would fall below the midline, average letters hit the midline, and large letters take up the entire line. Large letters are a sign that someone is pretty outgoing, sociable, and may like being the center of attention. However, it can also indicate false confidence and a desire to be something they're not. Small letters can mean someone is more shy and timid. Small letters can also indicate meticulousness and intense focus. Average size letters mean the person is well-adjusted and adaptable. They occupy a nice middle ground between two extremes."

Someone's method of writing certain letters can be great clues into their personality. A narrow loop in the lowercase \u201ce\u201d can indicate skepticism or suspicion towards others. This person may be guarded and stoic. A wide loop can show that the person is more open to new people and experiences. A person who dots their lowercase \u201ci\u201d very high may be more creative and free-spirited than a person who dots the \u201ci\u201d right on top. Those people tend to be more structured and detail-oriented. If the dot on the \u201ci\u201d is an open circle, the person may be more spirited and childlike.

Someone who uses a large \u201cI\u201d may be cocky and a little overly confident.

Crossing a \u201ct\u201d very high up can mimic having high goals and high esteem, while crossing the \u201ct\u201d low can indicate the opposite. If their \u201co\u201d is left open, the writer may be more of an open book. They tend to be expressive and willing to share secrets.
