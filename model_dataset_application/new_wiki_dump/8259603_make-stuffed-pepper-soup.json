Cook the beef and break it up with a spoon as it cooks. Once it's brown and cooked to 160 degrees F (71 C), scoop it out of the pan and set it aside. Drain the grease from the pan if there's more than a tablespoon. For an even leaner soup, consider substituting ground turkey breast for the beef. This will also cut out some of the grease that ends up in the soup."

Saute the vegetables for 3 minutes or until they begin to soften a little. Add the minced garlic and cook the mixture for another 30 seconds. The garlic should just begin to smell fragrant. Avoid overcooking the garlic since it can burn quickly."

Once the rice is cooked and fluffed, you can add it directly to the soup or let people stir the rice into their soup bowls.

Cover the slow cooker and cook the soup on low for 5 to 6 hours or on high for 3 hours. Add the cooked rice before you're ready to serve the soup. Wait to garnish the soup with any fresh herbs (like parsley) or cheese until right before you're ready to serve it."
