  "text":" Making the basket Weight the container. To prevent it from falling over when using, add something to the base of it such as a stone, a few pebbles wrapped in newspaper or some other similarly weighted object. Glue to the base of the container to prevent it from shaking around. Make the rope circles. Wind the thick piping cord around and around the outside of the container. Glue each round in place as you go. If you run out of a length, simply cut some more piping and join as neatly as you can, trying to hide the join. Cut the piping neatly where it finishes at the top of the container. Stitch the join at the top row of piping directly to the container. Use a large, sturdy needle to pierce through the plastic or paper container. Fill the container with suitable filling. Soft toy stuffing, batting, old scraps of fabric, etc., will all work. Pile up a little at the top, to create the rounded effect of a pincushion. Attaching the pincushion top Cover the top of the basket with fabric. Velvet, strong cotton, linen or similar strong fabrics are suitable for this part of the pincushion. Stitch or glue in place.  Cover the raw edge. Run the piping braid around the join at the base of the pincushion top, to hide the stitches or gluing. Join and cut off neatly. Cut off any loose or fraying parts to neaten.  Attaching the base Draw around the base of the container onto a piece of strong card.  Cut out the circle shape from the card.  Use this template to cut out a circle of plain fabric.
