Pinch the plant at the desired point between your finger and your thumbnail until you feel the stem break. Then gently and carefully remove the unwanted section of the plant. If you prune by hand, dip your fingers into a solution of powdered milk and water when moving between plants. The protein in the milk solution can deactivate viruses and bacteria that might otherwise spread between your different plants."

At this point the plant should have a sizable root system, which it will use to quickly strengthen the remaining stem and grow new buds. The center stem of most pepper plants will likely look like a \u2018Y\u2019 when the plant is this tall. Make sure the point you are pruning from is above this \u2018Y\u2019, as this is the base of your pepper plant. Pruning excess foliage at this stage will encourage the plant to strengthen that base.

Pat Browne and Steve Masley, of Grow it Organically, say: \"By taking off the top of a pepper plant, you create a shorter, bushier plant, and it's usually stronger and more stout. This happens because the branches form at leaf junctions and grow outward, instead of growing straight up, which can make the plant floppy.\""

          "description":"Nodes are sections of a stem where new leaves and stems can develop. If these areas look overly crowded, or underdeveloped, prune them back. While it may feel a bit harsh, limiting leaf production ensures that the leaves you do have left are fully developed. It also promotes further stem growth. If you are leaving very few leaves per node early on in the growing season, try to leave a few more as the season progresses. By the mid-to-late growing season, the stem structure should be fairly strong, and leaving additional leaves allows the plant to best use increasing levels of light. These leaves can also provide shade for incoming fruit."
