          "description":"Place the fruit in the microwave and set it in the defrost setting. Then, set the timer for no more than 30 seconds for smaller fruit, such as blueberries, to make sure the fruit doesn\u2019t overcook. For larger fruit, such as a frozen banana, set the timer for about 2 minutes. If your microwave doesn\u2019t have a defrost setting, you can also use the 50% power setting. This will ensure that the outside of fruit doesn\u2019t start to cook will the inside is still frozen."

          "headline":"Check if the fruit is equally thawed across the plate.",
          "description":"Before microwaving the fruit any longer, open the microwave door and check to see if the fruit is done defrosting or needs to be stirred. If some of the fruit is partially thawed while other sections are still frozen, use a spoon to stir it up so it defrosts more evenly. Because frozen fruit tends to defrost unevenly in the microwave, remove any pieces that are done before defrosting the rest for more time. Strawberries, for example, tend to defrost unevenly because they come in a wide variety of sizes. Therefore, some of the smaller strawberries may be done after 30 seconds, while larger ones may need more time in the microwave. Make sure that you use a spoon or fork when handling the fruit, as using your hands can cause bacteria to transfer."

Make sure that you reset it to the defrost setting before pressing the \u201cstart\u201d button.

Then, seal the baggie tightly to keep any water or air from getting in. Allowing any air or water into the baggie while the fruit defrosts could introduce bacteria.

Then, fill a large bowl with the cold water, leaving about 2 inches (5.1 cm) at the top so it doesn\u2019t spill over when you add the fruit.

          "description":"To make sure that the water stays cold so the fruit won\u2019t grow bacteria as it defrosts, remove the fruit from the bowl every 30 minutes and drain the water. As you change the water, press down on a piece of the fruit with a spoon to see if it\u2019s done thawing. If the fruit is still frozen, refill the bowl with cold water and return the fruit baggie into the water as quickly as you can. Smaller fruit, such as blackberries, raspberries, and blueberries, will likely thaw quicker than larger, more dense fruit, such as apples or peaches. Checking the fruit when you change the water will let you know as soon as it\u2019s done defrosting so you can use it immediately or transfer it to the refrigerator."
