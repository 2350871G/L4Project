This displacement of the sensors could be good (landing in a hole next to a big number, and being awarded the big number) or bad (you could get the ball perfectly in the Jackpot hole, but if the sensor is displaced, it could ruin your luck by awarding you something else).

However, DON'T wait too long, because if you do, other people may end up nabbing that big Jackpot, instead of you.
