          "headline":"Plan and check out your route before lifting an item.",
          "description":"Never pick up a heavy object without first knowing exactly where you plan to take it and how you\u2019ll get it there. Look over the entire route and make sure there are no obstructions along the way. For instance, if your kid has already opened a box of their toys and spread them on the floor, it could be very dangerous to carry a heavy box through that area."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Get close to the object and take a wide stance.",
          "description":"Place your feet at just beyond shoulder width and stand as close to the object as you can. If you\u2019re picking up a smaller moving box, for instance, stand so that your toes are beyond the front of the box. Taking a wider stance gives you a stronger, more stable base for lifting. It also makes it easier to lift with your legs instead of your back. Your goal is to reach out as little as possible to grab the item before lifting it."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Crouch down with your back straight and head forward.",
          "description":"Your back should maintain its natural, slight curve. Never arch your back to bend over top of the item. Also, don\u2019t look down at the item as you crouch\u2014keep your head level and look straight forward. Your feet should be flat on the ground with your weight centered over them. Arching your back and neck puts all the weight of the object you're lifting onto the muscles supporting those areas. Instead, you want the more powerful muscles of your legs and core to take on the weight."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Keep your hands below your shoulders and grip firmly.",
          "description":"Slide your fingers under the item, beneath its center of gravity. For a moving box, you may be able to instead grip your hands around the far corners, near the bottom. Use your thumbs, fingers, and palms to secure a firm grip. If you can\u2019t get a good grip, don\u2019t try to lift the item. Tilt a lighter item forward to slide your fingers underneath if necessary, but don\u2019t risk pinning or crushing your fingers beneath a heavier item. Instead, use a dolly or hand cart to lift and move the item."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Breathe deeply throughout and exhale as you lift.",
          "description":"Don\u2019t make the mistake of holding your breath while you lift\u2014this robs you of oxygen. Instead, breathe slowly and deeply throughout, and time a full exhale for the moment when you begin to lift the item. Holding your breath naturally tenses your core muscles, which is helpful when lifting. However, you can\u2014and should\u2014engage your core muscles without holding your breath. Even a brief shortage of oxygen may reduce your lifting and carrying capabilities. Also, it's possible that you might black out and be injured."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Push upward with your feet and legs to stand upright.",
          "description":"Focus on drawing your power from the ground up. Push off straight up from your feet, then use your leg muscles to propel your body straight up. Use your arms to hold the item steady, and your core muscles to keep your body balanced and stable. Your posture should remain in its natural curve throughout the lift. If you\u2019re arching your back and then straightening it out while lifting, you\u2019re at a much greater risk of injury."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Keep the item at waist height as you hold it.",
          "description":"The bottom of the item should be right about at your hips, with your hands at or just a little above that level\u2014depending on where you\u2019re gripping the item. Do not lift the item above shoulder height without assistance. Hoisting heavy objects higher than shoulder level is an easy way to injure your back. Instead of trying to move a box onto a high shelf to unpack later, for instance, move it to a table and unpack it there."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Pivot your feet instead of twisting your back to turn.",
          "description":"While holding the item, start every turn at your feet and follow with your upper body. Do not twist at the waist and then shuffle your feet to reposition them. If you twist your back without moving your feet, you'll put enormous strain on your spine and its supporting muscles. Put your stronger leg muscles in charge of turning instead."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Put the item down the same way you lifted it.",
          "description":"Do the entire process in reverse: square up your body, with your feet a bit beyond shoulder width; use your legs to lower yourself down, keeping your back at its natural slight curve and your head pointed forward; and release your grip once the item is securely in place. Make sure to keep breathing while putting the item down as well!"

So, instead of packing fewer, bigger boxes full of stuff, fill more, smaller boxes with your moving items.

Use proper lifting technique to tip up one side slightly and slide a sheet of cardboard beneath it. Then, do the same with the other side. From there, you should be able to safely push the item across multiple types of flooring. Push with your legs, keeping your back at its natural slight curve, your head up, and your arms bent. Don\u2019t arch your back when pushing. It\u2019s easier on your back to push rather than pull. You can also buy moving sliders to place under furniture and other heavy items.

Hand trucks are great for moving boxes and appliances\u2014you just need to slide the platform under the item, secure the item in place with the straps, tilt back the handle to lift the item onto the two wheels, and push or pull the hand truck to your destination. Hand trucks are often called dollies, although technically a dolly has a level platform and four wheels (meaning you have to lift the item onto it). You can rent hand trucks and other moving tools from home improvement stores and tool rental stores. If you rent a truck from a moving company, you may also be able to get some moving tools to use. No matter what moving tools you use, make sure you know how to use them properly, follow all safety recommendations, and don\u2019t exceed the maximum safe load.

The more in-shape your body is on moving day, the less likely you\u2019ll be to injure your back.

Then, every hour or so, take a break, drink some water and rest for 5 minutes, and do some stretching for another 3-5 minutes. Finish off your day by doing some light stretches as well. Hip twists, shoulder rolls, toe touches, and several common yoga poses are all good back stretches to utilize. Drink water during your hourly break, and also several times in between each break.

In theory, they help stabilize your core and back muscles, thereby reducing your risk of injury. While this may be the case, it\u2019s also true there is inadequate scientific evidence to confirm this claim. So, it\u2019s possible that it may not actually help to wear a back belt, but it also likely won\u2019t hurt to do so. It may be detrimental, however, if wearing it gives you a false sense of security, leading you to try lifting too much or with poor technique. Most back belts are made of sturdy fabric, loop over the shoulders, and are secured at the waist by adjustable hook-and-loop (Velcro) closures."

To combat general back soreness, take it easy for a few days, alternately apply ice and heat to the area as needed, and use anti-inflammatory pain relievers if necessary.
