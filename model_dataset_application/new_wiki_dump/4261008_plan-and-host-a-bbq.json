Make sure there are some side dishes like potato salad, salad, couscous, watermelon, etc. Have drinks such as lemonade, beer, smoothies or even just water! You want most foods that are able to go on a grill since you'll be barbecuing them. Salads just be made before-hand to give yourself more time ahead."
