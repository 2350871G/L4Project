Avoid overloading plugs and check light fixtures in your home and use bulbs that are the correct wattage. Check that your home contains GFCIs (ground fault circuit interrupters) or AFCI's (Arc fault circuit interrupters), which prevent electrical shock and fire by shutting off faulty circuits. Be careful about do-it-yourself electrical projects. Studies have shown that many home fires are caused by improper installation of electrical devices.

          "headline":"Ensure you have an adequate smoke alarm system.",
          "description":"Having a smoke alarm in the house cuts your risk of dying in a fire in half. Almost 60% of all fatal residential fires occur in homes that don't have smoke alarms, so this may be the single most important thing you can do to keep your family safe from fires. If your home doesn't have smoke alarms, now is the time to install them on every level of your home and in each bedroom. If possible, choose one with a 10-year lithium battery. If your smoke alarm uses regular batteries, remember to replace them every year (hint: change your batteries when you change your clock back from Daylight Saving Time in the fall). Test your smoke alarms monthly, and be sure your kids are familiar with the sound of the alarm. Because smoke rises, smoke detectors should always be placed on ceilings or high on walls. If a smoke detector near the kitchen goes off while you're cooking, do not take the battery out of it\u2014you may forget to replace it. Open the doors and windows instead. Or you might consider installing a rate-of-rise heat detector for places like the kitchen, where smoke or steam from cooking are likely to cause false alarms. These alarms can sense when the temperature reaches a set critical point or when it rises by more than a certain number of degrees a minute. If you're having a new home built or remodeling an older home, you may want to consider adding a home sprinkler system. These are already found in many apartment buildings and dormitories. Carbon monoxide alarms also can be lifesaving."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Have fire extinguishers around the house.",
          "description":"Be prepared for any accidents by having fire extinguishers strategically placed around your house\u2014at least one on each floor and in the kitchen (this one should be an all-purpose extinguisher, meaning it can be used on grease and electrical fires), the basement, the garage, or workshop area. Keep them out of reach of children. Fire extinguishers are best used when a fire is contained in a small area, like a wastebasket, and when the fire department has already been called. The best time to learn how to use the fire extinguisher is now, before you ever need it (if you have any questions, the local fire department can help). Fire extinguishers have gauges on them indicating when they need to be replaced and should be checked regularly to make sure they're still functional. If you're ever in doubt about whether to use an extinguisher on a fire, don't try it. Instead, leave the house immediately and call the fire department. The NFPA says to remember the acronym PASS when operating an extinguisher:\nPull the pin. Release the lock with the nozzle pointing away from you. Aim low. Point the extinguisher at the base of the fire. Squeeze the lever slowly and evenly. Sweep the nozzle from side to side."

          "description":"The location of a smoke alarm is very important. It is necessary to have a smoke alarm in each bedroom as you are most vulnerable in bed. If you or family members sleep with the door closed connect the alarm with others in the house. Interconnecting smoke alarms are especially important when there is more than one story or if the bedrooms are located in different parts of the house. Smoke alarm manufacturers recommend replacing smoke alarms every ten years. If your house has more than one-storey place one on each level and at the bottom of each stair well. Avoid placing a smoke alarm near air-conditioning or heating. The air flow coming out of the unit may blow the smoke away and fail to alert you."

(500 mm) below the ceiling line. For a cathedral ceiling make sure the smoke detector is between 20 in. (500 mm) and 60 in. (1500 mm) from the apex.

Fires can start when food is left unsupervised on a stove or in an oven or microwave, grease spills, a dish towel too close to the burner, a toaster or toaster oven flare-up or a coffee pot accidentally left on. Always supervise kids while cooking and practice safe cooking habits such as turning all pot handles in so they can't be accidentally knocked over and not wearing loose-fitting clothing that could catch fire around the stove. Make your fireplace safe. Keep your fireplace clean and covered with a screen to keep sparks from jumping out. Only wood should be burned in the fireplace because paper and other materials can escape while burning and ignite nearby items. Never leave a fire burning unattended and make sure a fire is completely extinguished before leaving the house or going to bed. Have the chimney professionally cleaned once a year. Keep your kids safe from matches. Playing with matches is still the leading cause of fire-related deaths and injuries for kids younger than five years. Always keep matches and lighters out of children's reach. Store flammable materials such as gasoline, kerosene, and cleaning supplies outside of your home and away from kids. Use candles safely. As decorative candles become more popular, candle fires are on the rise. If you light candles, keep them out of reach of kids and pets, away from curtains and furniture, and extinguish them before you go to bed. Make sure candles are in sturdy holders made of non-flammable material that won't tip over. Don't let your children no use candles unsupervised in their rooms. Be careful of holiday dangers. Around the holidays, there are even more potential fire hazards to think about. If you use a real Christmas tree in your home, make sure to water it daily and do not tie electric lights strung on a dried-out tree. All lights and lighted window ornaments should be inspected every year to make sure that cords are not worn or frayed, and all candles should be used with care. The number of fires started by candles nearly doubles during the month of December. Ensure you have an adequate smoke alarm system. Having a smoke alarm in the house cuts your risk of dying in a fire in half. Almost 60% of all fatal residential fires occur in homes that don't have smoke alarms, so this may be the single most important thing you can do to keep your family safe from fires. If your home doesn't have smoke alarms, now is the time to install them on every level of your home and in each bedroom. If possible, choose one with a 10-year lithium battery. If your smoke alarm uses regular batteries, remember to replace them every year (hint: change your batteries when you change your clock back from Daylight Saving Time in the fall). Test your smoke alarms monthly, and be sure your kids are familiar with the sound of the alarm. Because smoke rises, smoke detectors should always be placed on ceilings or high on walls. If a smoke detector near the kitchen goes off while you're cooking, do not take the battery out of it\u2014you may forget to replace it. Open the doors and windows instead. Or you might consider installing a rate-of-rise heat detector for places like the kitchen, where smoke or steam from cooking are likely to cause false alarms. These alarms can sense when the temperature reaches a set critical point or when it rises by more than a certain number of degrees a minute. If you're having a new home built or remodeling an older home, you may want to consider adding a home sprinkler system. These are already found in many apartment buildings and dormitories. Carbon monoxide alarms also can be lifesaving. Have fire extinguishers around the house. Be prepared for any accidents by having fire extinguishers strategically placed around your house\u2014at least one on each floor and in the kitchen (this one should be an all-purpose extinguisher, meaning it can be used on grease and electrical fires), the basement, the garage, or workshop area. Keep them out of reach of children. Fire extinguishers are best used when a fire is contained in a small area, like a wastebasket, and when the fire department has already been called. The best time to learn how to use the fire extinguisher is now, before you ever need it (if you have any questions, the local fire department can help). Fire extinguishers have gauges on them indicating when they need to be replaced and should be checked regularly to make sure they're still functional. If you're ever in doubt about whether to use an extinguisher on a fire, don't try it. Instead, leave the house immediately and call the fire department. The NFPA says to remember the acronym PASS when operating an extinguisher:\nPull the pin. Release the lock with the nozzle pointing away from you. Aim low. Point the extinguisher at the base of the fire. Squeeze the lever slowly and evenly. Sweep the nozzle from side to side. Fire Alarms Understand the importance. A smoke alarm can alert you and give you time to escape. Alarms can be wired to mains with battery back up or battery only. Wired alarms are more reliable in the long term. Decide which type is more suitable. The two main types for home is photoelectric and ionization. Both alarms are very effective, but photoelectric are more effective for detecting smouldering fires. Many homes have the ionisation type installed, however fire fighters recommend that photoelectric type should be installed in bedrooms and adjacent hallways. Install the alarm. The location of a smoke alarm is very important. It is necessary to have a smoke alarm in each bedroom as you are most vulnerable in bed. If you or family members sleep with the door closed connect the alarm with others in the house. Interconnecting smoke alarms are especially important when there is more than one story or if the bedrooms are located in different parts of the house. Smoke alarm manufacturers recommend replacing smoke alarms every ten years. If your house has more than one-storey place one on each level and at the bottom of each stair well. Avoid placing a smoke alarm near air-conditioning or heating. The air flow coming out of the unit may blow the smoke away and fail to alert you. Install on the wall if necessary. Smoke alarms should be installed on the ceiling, but if this is not possible you may install it on the wall. In this case fit it between 6 in. (150 mm) and 12 in. (300 mm) below the ceiling line. Check with the manufacturers instructions if it is suitable for wall mounting. Locate the smoke alarm from dead space. When fitting the smoke alarm near a corner location on the wall, avoid placing it in dead space. The corner can create dead space because it traps hot air and stops it from reaching the smoke alarm. In this case fit the smoke alarm between 12 in. (300 mm) and 20 in. (500 mm) below the ceiling line. For a cathedral ceiling make sure the smoke detector is between 20 in. (500 mm) and 60 in. (1500 mm) from the apex. Check the manufacturers instructions to make sure it is suitable for wall mounting. Maintain your smoke alarm so it will continue to work effectively. Here are some things you should do:\nTest the alarm weekly. Clean the smoke alarm and ceiling around it with a vacuum cleaner each month. Change the battery at least once a year with the battery specified by the alarm manufacturer. Fire Blankets Understand what they are used for. A fire blanket is very effective for smothering flames. You can use a fire blanket to cover a pan of burning cooking oil or burning clothes on a child. Fire blanket contains display instructions for their use. Put out oil fires. A fire blanket can be used to smother a cooking oil fire. Ensure the blanket does not contact the burning oil and that the stove is off. Never use water to put out oil fires. Throw the blanket out if it has been used. A fire blanket should only be used once. When you buy a new one ensure it meets the appropriate country standards. Put the fire blanket in the best place. Fire blankets should be placed where they can be easily reached in an emergency. Place it near the normally used path to exit the kitchen. Home Escape Plan Draw a floor pan of your house and identify two ways to exit for each room. If you live in a two-storey house find a way to escape from the second level. Choose a meeting place. You should have a designated meeting place at the front of the house where everyone should meet. Most people use their mail box as their meeting place. Check that the Windows and fly screens open freely and that children can open them. Give special considerations to elderly or disabled people. Display the escape plan in a central area of your home. You could put it on the fridge or notice board. Practice the escape plan at least twice a year. Ensure you are able to escape from your home in the event of a fire. When at home keep a key inside the deadlock so you can leave quickly. Remember you may have less than two minutes to leave. Practice Fire Drills at Home Understand it is important to practice escaping. Planned escape routes are a necessity, especially if a fire were to occur during the night. Go through each room in your house and think about the possible exits. You should have in your mind two escape routes from each room, in case one is blocked by fire. Inspect the room to make sure that furniture and other objects are not blocking doorways or window. Train your family basic evacuation procedure. When there is smoke, crawl low and get under the smoke. Alert others as you go. When there is smoke crawl low to get under the smoke. Test each door with the back of your hand. Close the door as you go through it to prevent fire and smoke from spreading. Never go back inside the house, once out you stay out. Meet at the assembly area such as the letterbox. Make sure your family know how to call the fire service. Alert others as you go. Fires are frightening and can cause panic. By rehearsing different scenarios, your family will be less likely to waste precious time trying to figure out what to do. Make sure that the windows in every room are easy to open and are not painted over or nailed shut. Remember these may be your only way out in a fire. If you live in an apartment building, make sure any safety bars on windows are removable in an emergency. Be sure to know the locations of the closest stairwells or fire escapes and where they lead. If your house is more than one story tall or if you live above the ground floor of an apartment building, an escape ladder is an important safety feature. You should have one escape ladder made of fire-safe material (aluminum, not rope) in each upper-story bedroom that is occupied by a person who is capable of using it. Like fire extinguishers, escape ladders should be operated by adults only. The ladder must be approved by an independent testing laboratory, its length must be appropriate for your home, and it must support the weight of the heaviest adult in the house. Discuss and rehearse the escape routes you've planned for each room of your home. Designate a meeting place outside your house or apartment building that is a safe distance away (a mailbox, a fence, or even a distinctive-looking tree will do) where everyone can be accounted for after they escape. Every so often, test your plan. Use your finger to set off the smoke detector and let everyone know it's time for a fire drill. See if everyone can evacuate your home and gather outside within 3 minutes which is the time it can take for an entire house to go up in flames. Be sure any babysitters in your home know all escape routes and plans in case of a fire.  Fire Extinguishers Select which type of portable fire extinguisher. There are many types available. Each type may be rated for one or more classes of fire. Some fires can be extremely dangerous to use on certain classes of fire and can increase the fire threatening your safety. Understand the six classes of fire. Class A: Wood, paper, plastics, etc. Class B: Flammable liquids. Class C: Flammable gasses. Class D: Metal fires. Class E: Energized electrical equipment. Class F: Cooking oils and fats. Learn about the different types of fire extinguishers and what they do. Water (Colored red): Dangerous if used on flammable liquid, energized electrical equipment and cooking oil or fat fires. Wet Chemical (Colored oatmeal or oatmeal label): Dangerous if used on energized electrical equipment. Foam (Colored blue or blue label): Dangerous if used on energized electrical equipment. ABE or BE Powder (White label): Specific types of powders available for metal fires. Carbon dioxide (Black label): Generally not suitable for outdoor use. Suitable only for small fires. Vaporizing liquid (Colored yellow or yellow label): Check the characteristics of the specific agent. Understand the three different types of fire extinguishers. They are Rechargeable, non-rechargeable or aerosol. Rechargeable fire extinguisher: Designed for households in various sizes and different extinguisher mediums. Non-rechargeable fire extinguisher: These contain a powder extinguishant. Aerosol fire extinguisher: These are non-rechargeable and cover a wide range of fire classes. Check the manufactures recommendation for specific use. Get your fire extinguisher replaced, serviced or refilled after use. Check that the fire extinguisher you use complies with your countries safety standards and read the label carefully before you need to use it. Always have rechargeable fire extinguishers serviced and maintained by a qualified agent. Dispose aerosol fire extinguishers before the use by date. Know when and how to use a fire extinguisher. Fire extinguishers are for small fires only. Make sure you don't place yourself in danger by using one, be sure that before you attempt to put it out it is small enough to be managed by a fire extinguisher and that you aren't going to spread it. Put the fire out with care. Before you use the extinguisher to fight, make sure you have a clear view and can approach it safely. Do not attempt to fight the fire if it is too hot or fierce. Fire can block your escape when they become out of control so ensure your back is towards an exit and you have a clear path to escape. If it is not safe run away and call the fire service. Put out oil and fat fires. Never use a water extinguisher to put out cooking oil or a fat fire. A BE fire extinguisher is recommended to have in kitchens. It is best to place it in the path you use to leave the kitchen, such as the kitchen door. When using a powder extinguisher on burning cooking oil or fat it is recommend you stand two meters away from the fire and aim over the pan. Do not aim the extinguishant directly into the pan that contains the oil or fat because it might spread the fire around the kitchen. Caring for Pets Extinguish open flames. Pets are generally curious and will investigate cooking appliances, candles or even a fire in your fireplace. Ensure your pet is not left unattended around an open flame and make sure to thoroughly extinguish any open flame before leaving your home. Remove stove knobs. Ensure you remove stove knobs or protect them with covers before leaving the house. A stove or cook top is the number one piece of equipment involved in your pet starting a fire. Invest in flameless candles. These candles contain a light bulb rather than an open flame, and take the danger out of your pet knocking over a candle. Cats are notorious for starting fires when their tails turn over lit candles. Beware of water bowls on wooden decks. Do not leave a glass water bowl for your pet outside on a wooden deck. When filtered through the glass and water, the sun\u2019s rays can actually heat up and ignite the wooden deck beneath it. Choose stainless steel or ceramic bowls instead. Pet-proof the home. Take a walk around your home and look for areas where pets might start fires inadvertently, such as loose wires and other potential hazards. Keep your pets safe. Keep pets near entrances when away from home. When leaving pets home alone, keep them in areas or rooms near entrances where firefighters can easily find them. Secure young pets. Especially with young puppies, keep them confined away from potential fire-starting hazards when you are away from home, such as in crates or behind baby gates in secure areas. Practice escape routes with pets. Keep collars and leashes easily accessible in case you have to evacuate quickly with your pet or firefighters need to rescue your pet. Consider using monitored smoke detection services. As an added layer of protection beyond battery-operated smoke alarms, smoke detectors connected to a monitoring center help save pets who can\u2019t escape when left home alone. Affix a pet alert window cling. Write down the number of pets inside your house and attach the static cling to a front window. This critical information saves rescuers time when locating your pets. Make sure to keep the number of pets listed on them updated.",
