  "text":" Eating Plain Noni Fruit Wait until the fruit has tender, translucent yellow skin before eating it. That's when the noni fruit is fully ripened. If your noni fruit is hard and white or green, it\u2019s not ripe yet. Don't try to eat your noni fruit before it's ripe or the skin will be too tough to chew and swallow. Place the ripe noni fruit on a plate or cutting board. Cutting noni fruit can get messy, so it\u2019s best if you cut it on something. That way you can eat it right then and there or transfer it to a plate for serving. Use a knife to cut the noni fruit into thin slices crosswise. Cut the slices so they\u2019re about .25 inches (0.64 cm) thick. If your noni fruit is really ripe, it may fall apart slightly as you\u2019re cutting it because of how mushy it is. If one of the slices falls apart, just continue slicing the fruit. Chew the seeds in the noni fruit or spit them out. Noni fruit contains a lot of seeds on the inside that are safe to eat. If you don\u2019t want to eat the seeds, spit them out into a napkin or trash can as you\u2019re eating the slices of noni. Try pairing noni fruit with salt and a strong cheese if you don\u2019t like the taste. Sprinkle salt onto the noni fruit slices. Then, grab a slice of cheese and sandwich it between your fingers with the noni. Eat the cheese and noni together in one bite. Making Noni Juice Rinse a fully ripened noni fruit with water. You want to wait until your noni fruit is ripe before you use it to make juice. When the fruit is tender and a translucent yellow color, it\u2019s ripe. If your noni fruit is hard and a green or white color, it\u2019s not ripe yet. One noni fruit will make enough juice for 2 people. Blend the noni fruit in a blender with 1 cup (240 mL) of cold water.
