  "text":" Assembling Your WetJet Slide the poles together with the latches lined up. Swiffer WetJets come in 3 pieces. Line them all up, with the mop on the bottom, the pole with the handle on top, and the third piece in the middle. You should hear a click when they slide together. Once the poles are assembled, it\u2019ll be pretty difficult to disassemble them. Slide open the battery compartment and put in 4 AA batteries.

Slide the tab upwards, so that the battery compartment slides out of the WetJet base. Then, insert 4 new AA batteries. If you just bought the WetJet, it should come with batteries that you can put in. Attach the pad print-side down. Don\u2019t remove the plastic layer on the back of the cleaning pad.

Mopping with the WetJet Use the WetJet on finished hardwood, ceramic, vinyl, or laminate floors. The WetJet will work well on most kinds of floors, but you shouldn\u2019t use it on unsealed wood floors or carpeted floors.

In fact, if you mop too often, dirt may stick to your damp floors. Try and mop about once a week or every other week. You may want to mop your kitchen floors more often than the rest of your floors. Changing the Pads and Refilling the Solution Replace the WetJet pads after every use. Just unpeel the dirty pad and toss it away. Put a new pad onto the bottom of your Swiffer so that it\u2019s all set to go next time you need to mop your floors.
