Even if it doesn\u2019t need to be washed after you use it, rinse out the cloth thoroughly under warm running water, then wring out the excess water and either lay the cloth flat or hang it up to dry.

Put a drop of dish soap on the cloth and work it into the fabric, then rinse it out until all the soap and dirt are gone. If you are using a face cloth, wash it this way after every use, then wash it with your regular laundry about once a week. It\u2019s especially important to rinse Norwex Antibac cloths very well, because they contain silver. If you don't rinse the soap out of a cloth, it will leave a residue that will reduce the silver\u2019s effectiveness at killing bacteria."

This will allow the fibers to well, releasing dirt and other debris that may be trapped deep inside the cloth. Use tongs to remove the cloth from the hot water when it's finished boiling. Alternately, you can pour boiling water over your Norwex microfiber cloth, along with a little detergent. Let it soak for 10 minutes to open the fibers and release dirt and odors."
