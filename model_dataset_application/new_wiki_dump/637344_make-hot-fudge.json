If you decide that you want your fudge to get hard when it hits cold ice cream, substitute the syrup for extra sugar, or try removing the syrup altogether for a slightly less sugary fudge. You may choose either golden syrup or corn syrup. Golden syrup is made from sugar cane, while corn syrup is made from \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 corn. Golden syrup has a richer, more complex flavor profile than corn syrup, although it's more expensive. In America, most corn syrup is genetically modified."
