          "description":"While it's more expensive, cotton is generally a solid choice for a shower curtain. Cotton curtains tend to hold up best and are also easiest to wash. They can also give your bathroom a dressier feel. Cotton absorbs moisture easily. If you get a cotton curtain, make sure you get a quality liner to go with it. Keep in mind that a cotton shower curtain will need to be washed once a month to stay nice and clean."

          "description":"If you don't want to spend a lot of time maintaining a shower curtain, vinyl curtains can be a great option. They can be cleaned and come in a variety of colors, making coordinating them with other bathroom decor simple. In addition to vinyl, you can try synthetic materials such as nylon or polyester. Because vinyl shower curtains are cheaper, they're great if you plan on switching up your bathroom decor frequently."

          "headline":"Go for an organic option.",
          "description":"If you're environmentally conscious, you may want a curtain that reflects these values. Look for curtains made of environmentally friendly materials, such as hemp, if you want a curtain that minimizes use of chemicals and artificial materials. Keep in mind, organic curtains may be more expensive and more difficult to maintain."

          "description":"Microfiber curtains are more moisture-resistant than cotton curtains but softer than things like vinyl and polyester. Such curtains are heavier, so they may work well if your bathroom has heavy water pressure. They are also machine washable, which can cut down on cleaning time. Since microfiber curtains are heavier, you'll want to make sure your curtain rod is sturdy enough to hold one up."

          "headline":"Select a solid liner material.",
          "description":"Almost all shower curtains will require some kind of curtain liner. Take this into consideration as well. You want to choose a solid liner that will protect your curtains from moisture. Go for curtains that are clear or light. These allow more light in the shower. Most liners are made out of vinyl. If you're environmentally conscious, it may be difficult to find an alternative. However, if it's important to you, try to seek out non-vinyl liners in a store or online, but keep in mind they will be harder to maintain. Weighted liners work best, as these stay in place more easily. Look for mold-resistant curtain liners. They're more pricey, but you won't have to replace them as often."

          "headline":"Consider decorative curtains.",
          "description":"If you want a very decorative bathroom, consider decorative curtains. These curtains usually have a pattern or texture that makes them spruce up a room and are made out of higher quality fabrics. These are usually a good choice for a guest room. Also, as such curtains are more susceptible to damage from moisture, they may work best if you use your bath more than your shower. Decorative curtains are more expensive and difficult to maintain. Therefore, you should only opt for them if you're looking to make a room really stand out for whatever reason. They are not the most practical choice. Use decorative shower curtains in bathrooms where they won't get a lot of use, like your guest bathroom."

          "description":"If your bathroom has a more minimalistic design, or if you're going for practicality over decoration, see if you can find a solid color shower curtain. For simplicity's sake, a solid color curtain will work in most bathrooms when it falls into line with the existing color scheme. For example, a solid earth-toned curtain would go great in a bathroom with neutral colors."

          "headline":"Keep colors consistent throughout your bathroom.",
          "description":"You want to make sure your shower curtain does not clash with the existing color scheme. If your bathroom is colored in neutral shades, like whites, you can try adding a splash of color with a brighter curtain. However, if your bathroom already has a strict color scheme, try to choose a curtain to match. For example, say your bathroom has yellow tiles and a yellow sink. Try to pick a curtain in a complementary color, like a gray or green curtain. You could also do a curtain that contrasts with yellow, like a purple curtain."

Most hardware in a bathroom is somewhat subtle. However, if you have very large mirrors or very ornate light fixtures, you may want to opt for a plainer curtain. This will prevent the curtain's design from being overwhelming."

This can cost a bit more money but will be worth it as it will more adequately protect your bathroom floor from moisture. Measure your shower before going out to purchase a shower curtain. This will help you determine whether you need an extra large curtain. You can also use 2 shower curtains for an extra long shower rod and part them in the middle."
