Set your table saw for a 3/8\" inch cut. Place a piece of the 13 1/4\" tongue trimmed wood on the table saw. Carefully push the wood towards the blade. Once the saw has cut into the wood about an inch use a push stick and carefully guide the wood through the blade until fully cut. Make sure the wood is far enough from the blade, then carefully pick the wood up. Flip over the piece of wood over to the side that has not been cut and repeat the instructions for this step. You are going to need to rip two of the 13 1/4\" pieces of wood. This will give you four 3/8\" thick boards."
