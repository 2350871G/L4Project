Determine what you use on a daily basis and seek to have those items easily accessible. For example, if you do not use your food dehydrator often, place it into storage (basement, garage). It will save valuable space for items you may use on a daily basis (toaster, coffee maker). You may also determine usage of items based on season. For example, during the winter months you may not entertain as often. If so, you can place your serving trays and extra dishes in the basement until spring or summer comes.
