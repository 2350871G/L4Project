          "description":"Add 1 tablespoon of butter to your pan and turn the heat on to medium-high heat. Let the butter melt and heat your pan. You can cook your frittata in a 12-inch nonstick saute pan or cast-iron skillet. The pan doesn't have to have shallow sides since you won't be flipping or folding the frittata. Make sure the pan you use is oven-safe since you'll be finishing the frittata in the oven or under the broiler."

          "headline":"Warm or cook any vegetables and meat you're using.",
          "description":"As the butter melts and your pan heats up, add any pre-cooked vegetables and meat to quickly warm them up (about 2 minutes). You can use leftover vegetables or meat that you have in your refrigerator. Spread them so they form a single layer on the bottom of the pan. You can start with 1/2 cup of veggies and 1/2 cup of meat, although you can add more if you'd like to make a bigger frittata. If you're cooking raw vegetables, be sure to completely cook the vegetables (the time will vary depending on what veggies you're using)."

          "headline":"Mix up an egg base.",
          "description":"Add 1 ounce of grated Parmesan cheese, 6 whole eggs, and 1 teaspoon of ground black pepper into a mixing bowl. Whisk the mixture until it's completely combined. You can transfer or make the base in a mixing bowl with a pouring spout. This can make it easier to pour the egg mixture into your pan."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Pour the egg base into your pan and cook it.",
          "description":"Pour the egg base evenly in your pan so that it touches any vegetables and meats you're using. Stir and cook the frittata over medium-high heat for 4 or 5 minutes. The eggs will just start to firm up. If you want to use any chopped fresh herbs, sprinkle them over the top now. Use a heat-proof rubber spatula to stir the eggs. This will also prevent the spatula from scraping and ruining the bottom of your nonstick pan.If using a pan with a handle, be careful to use a pan that has an oven-proof handle before placing it in the oven or broiler/grill. Plastic handles can melt and catch on fire, while wooden handles risk burning."

          "headline":"Finish your frittata by baking or broiling it.",
          "description":"If you'd like to ensure a golden color on the top of your frittata, heat your broiler to high and place the frittata under the broiler for 2 to 4 minutes. The frittata should brown and puff up. If you're not comfortable with broiling, you could bake the frittata to finish it. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bake your frittata for 8 to 10 minutes or until the eggs are set. Broiling the frittata will also create a crispy top. Just keep a close eye while broiling the frittata since it will finish cooking very quickly."

You can serve the frittata hot, right out of the oven or cooled to room temperature. Always take care when using sharp knives. You should also remember to use oven mitts to take your frittata out of the oven or from under the broiler."

These cheeses are known for the following characteristics:\nFeta: use this cheese if you want a sharp, salty flavor. Ricotta: use just a little of this cheese for a really creamy taste. Goat cheese: pick this cheese for a tart and rich flavor. Cheddar: choose this cheese for its great melting quality and traditional taste.

Use cooked pasta that isn't covered in sauce or the frittata may not set up properly. You'll want to add about one cup of pasta along with your other ingredients. Rice is another good starch option to add some substance to your frittata. Add 1 cup of cooked rice along with your other ingredients."
