Dip one side of a bread disk into the reserved fruit juice and place into the ramekin, juice side down. Take a rectangle, dip one side into the juice, and place the juiced side against the mould of the ramekin. Repeat with another rectangle. Spoon in some of the mixed fruit and push it down. Take another disk, dip one side into the juice and place on top, juice side up. Just before closing the cling film, give the pudding a final push down, twist to close it and set aside. Repeat exactly the same process with all the remaining ramekins."
