          "description":"A well-coordinated room will look expensive even if the elements of the d\u00e9cor are cheap. Choose a theme that will tie together your room. This will help you look for inexpensive pieces while making it seem as though you have paid an interior decorator. Rooms that seem confused, cluttered, and mismatched have the look of cheap rather than luxury even if the pieces are lovely. For example:\nA beach-themed room would have pictures of the ocean, shell decorations, and a blue-green palette. A rustic, woodsy theme would have wood detailing, paintings of landscapes, and an earthy palette. Industrial themes use repurposed items, steel accents, and sharp edges to give the room a more modern edge. Gray, brick red, and black are popular colors. Minimalism is a popular and trendy design scheme where you use as few pieces as possible to decorate your room. Simple furniture and white or neutral colors will make the room look as though it could feature in a magazine, likes Home and Garden, but the style is inexpensive to recreate."

          "headline":"Focus on a neutral color palette.",
          "description":"Stick with white or light neutral shades, such as brown or gray, for the base color. Your walls and larger furniture pieces should belong to this color scheme. For example, you might have beige walls with white doors and gray furniture. Your feature elements will stand out against neutral colors more, which will make them seem more prominent. Some neutral colors you can mix and match include:\nGray\nSlate Blue\nTaupe\nSoft yellow\nOff-white shades like ivory and cream\nCoffee brown\nTan\nBeige"

        {
          "headline":"Add accent pieces.",
          "description":"Accent pieces are small decorative items that contrast with your neutral color scheme. They are usually either brightly colored or patterned. Accent pieces can be easily and cheaply be replaced if you ever change your style. Make sure all of your accent pieces are the same color for maximum effect. Some items you might consider for accents include:\nVases\nPillows or cushions\nBlankets or throws\nPicture Frames\nOttoman\nTablecloths\nFlowers\nFigurines\nStriped, dotted, or chevron patterned objects"

Having one grand piece will draw attention to it, making it seem important and pricey. A room in which there is no clear focus tends to feel cheap. Some good focal points for a room include:\nA large painting\nA unique table\nTwo retro mod chairs\nA wall decal\nFull-length book shelves\nAn ornate mirror"

          "headline":"Consider getting rid of dated details.",
          "description":"To some, the key to making d\u00e9cor seem expensive is to follow modern trends. To help your room remain stylish and cool, you should reduce the dated elements of its d\u00e9cor. Some common out-of-style elements include:\nVertical window blinds\nFormica tables\nClear plastic furniture\nFurniture painted to resemble marble or stone\nBroken or damaged items such as torn posters, cracked vases, or splintered wood.Obviously, antiques can lend an expensive looking touch to any room, especially if it is an family piece you have inherited and haven't had to pay for. As long your antiques are in good condition and tie in with the rest of the room's d\u0117cor, keep them. Don't ditch them just because they are old. It \"is\" possible to combine modern and antique pieces in a room."

        {
          "headline":"Avoid clutter.",
          "description":"Ironically, having less\" clutter in a room makes the overall impression that of luxury. You do not want a room that is filled with furniture and decorative items and resembles a second hand shop. Limit how many decorative pieces display. This creates the impression that you spent more on a few, expensive items instead of buying many cheaper items. When placing your decorative items around the room, keep a little bit of space between each item. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/1\\/1a\\/Fake-Expensive-Decor-Step-6.jpg\\/v4-460px-Fake-Expensive-Decor-Step-6.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/1\\/1a\\/Fake-Expensive-Decor-Step-6.jpg\\/v4-760px-Fake-Expensive-Decor-Step-6.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\nDecorative shelves should ideally not be crammed with items. It's tempting to fill that space with stuff. Instead, only fill 1/2 to 3/4 of the space, leaving some empty space. Keep your surfaces, such as coffee tables, counters, and TV stands mostly clear. Choose only one or two items to place on these surfaces. For example, you might keep a lamp on a side table with a single picture frame but nothing else. If in doubt, remove. Try taking out a piece of furniture. See what happens if the coffee table is simply moved to the another room. Or see what happens if you remove throw pillows/cushions. You may find that less is more."

          "description":"Thrift stores, charity shops, consignments, estate sales, and antique stores will often have old vintage or antiques items that are much cheaper than new. This is a great way to get inexpensive but quality items, such as wooden tables or embroidered chairs. Old wooden furniture can always be repainted. If you find a piece that is chipped or faded, you can paint it to match your color palette. You may find interesting and unusual items in these stores and shops. These will seem expensive because they are unique. For example, you might find a lunchbox from the 60s with old superheroes on it, or you might discover an antique milk pail that you can use for flowers."

If the artwork is in the public domain, you can even print out your own copy at a print shop, and frame it yourself. This is a great way to get quality reproductions of famous art pieces in your own home without paying a fortune. When sending the work to the print shop, make sure you send an HD copy so that you get the best image possible. You can also tear out images from an old calendar and frame them.

Cut the wallpaper to size of the backing of each shelf. Paste it on using wallpaper paste. Let it dry before you put items back on the shelves. If you are using the bookcase to display decorative objects like vases or figurines, you might want to choose a solid color for the wallpaper, so that more attention is drawn to your collection. If you are just using the shelves for books, you can choose a bold pattern, such as chevron stripes, polka dots, or a floral design. This will make the shelves an accent piece in their own right."

Plain white ceramic tiles, on the other hand, can be cheap. With a little time and effort, you can turn tiles into something stunning and extravagant. Find a stencil of a design you like, such as a fleur-de-lis or a bird. Press the stencil down on the tile, and paint over the design. Let the tile dry, and you have an easy, beautiful tile. You can then adhere it to the wall using tile mastic. Good places for painted tile backsplashes include underneath cabinets or above a countertop.
