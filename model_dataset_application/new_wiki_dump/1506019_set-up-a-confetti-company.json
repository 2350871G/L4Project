      "description":"Confetti was originally made of shredded ticker tape, but later, tiny pieces of colored or metallic paper became popular. In recent years, there has been an increasing demand for designer confetti that uses custom color ranges, shapes, or both. Many confetti companies offer confetti products that can be used as party favors, such as confetti eggs and confetti cones. Additionally, decorative packaging is used to make the confetti more attractive to buyers. Traditional confetti is made by shredding strips of paper or punching holes into colored sheets of paper to make tiny, round pieces of paper. To create custom designs, you'll need a pattern hole puncher. Ask at your local craft supplies store if they sell any, or go directly to the manufacturer to ask if they can create a unique design for you. Customers who buy confetti from confetti companies can be private individuals who want to use confetti for a wedding, baby shower, or any other kind of festive occasion. They can also be event and party planners who need large amounts of confetti for all of the events they organize and cater."
