Stick the wide end of the filling hose over the tip of the faucet. The filling hose for the washing machine will fit snugly over many standard faucets.

You might need to hold the drain hose in place and point it at a drain if you aren\u2019t able to securely hook it in place. Dry out the machine\u2019s wash basin and spin tub with a towel. Open up both of the washing machine\u2019s compartments. Wipe them out with a dry towel to remove excess moisture before you store the machine. This will ensure that the washing machine is fresh and dry the next time you want to use it. Disconnect the washing machine and put it away. Pull the filling hose off the faucet and the machine\u2019s water inlet and unhook the draining hose from the sink. Unplug the power cord from the electrical outlet.
