          "description":"In a simple substitution cipher, you can assigning letter values to other letters. For example, A may equal C and and F might equal J. Make sure you don\u2019t choose easy combinations like A = B or A = Z. They\u2019ll be easily broken. Make decoder rings. Those decoder rings you got in a box of cereal years ago may come in handy, but you can make your own too if you want. Write your letters, A through Z, in a large circle. Then, write the substituted letters inside the large circle to form their own smaller circle. Now you\u2019ll have a key for your cipher. Randomize the cipher. Once you\u2019ve got your keys and your friends have theirs too, you can cut out both rings from the paper. Turn the smaller ring inside the larger outer ring to create new substitutions. When you pass your note, write what A equals, and the reader will know where to set their rings."

          "description":"To make a slightly more complicated substitution cipher, you can make your own simple symbols to stand in for letters. The more each symbol looks different than the letter it represents, the harder the code will be to crack. Make sure each symbol is also simple and easy to draw quickly. Create a key for your new language. Make a master key that shows which letter matches up with each symbol. As you practice writing in your new script, you\u2019ll become more familiar with the symbols, but you\u2019ll need a key at first to remember which is which. Share the key with friends. Your language won\u2019t be of much use if only you can read the notes you pass! Share the key with your friends, advising them to keep it safe so that no one else finds and learns the symbols. Write your messages in the new language. Practice the symbols until you can read and write them as quickly as your native language. It\u2019ll take a while, but you\u2019ll get to know the symbols well over time."

Some foreign alphabets may not contain all the letters in your language. Greek doesn't have Y, but there's a visually similar Upsilon (Y in capitals), so you might use that instead. Make sure your reader knows that you\u2019re going to be substituting some letters for others not in the language. Test some examples. For example: \"See you tonight\" becomes \"\u03a3\u0395\u0395 \u03a4\u0397\u039f\u03a5 \u03a4\u039f\u039d\u0399\u0393\u0397\u03a4,\u201d with \u201cyou\u201d subbed out for \u201cthou\u201d because Greek doesn\u2019t have a character for \u201cY\u201d."

          "description":"Transposition codes take your normal message and rearrange the letters according to a simple, agreed upon rule. This type of cipher can be harder to crack than a substitution cipher, because there will be no frequently used words to be found: they\u2019ll all be scrambled. Write your message normally. Because you\u2019re going to be scrambling the message, you\u2019ll need the normal message as a starting place. Choose something simple to start with like, \u201cHow are you today\u201d\nDecide how to rearrange the letters. A simple transposition cipher, for example, might take each letter and place them in reverse order within the word, but not the sentence. \u201cHow are you today\u201d would become \u201cwoh era uoy yadot\u201d. Let your friends know the rearranging order. They\u2019ll need to know how you scrambled the words so that they can read your messages. Pick something a little more difficult than just reversing the letters, as the example of \u201cwoh era uoy yadot\u201d can be easily cracked. Try using a matrix. Draw large box on a piece of paper and divide it evenly into rows and columns. Write your normal message with one letter written in each smaller box. Your new message will be made by making the vertical columns into sentences instead of the horizontal ones. To decode, your friends will have to make their own grid, write the sentences vertically, then read left to right as normal."

Be aware that this may be easy to crack, because none of the words are scrambled. Write your message starting in one of the corners of the paper. Make a column up or down from where you started. Write in a straight line all the way to the next edge of the paper. Write the next column when you reach the edge. Once you reach the edge of the first column, start writing the next line in the opposite direction. If you started writing upwards from the bottom left corner, you\u2019ll now write in a line going down to the next edge of the page. Repeat for each column. Continue writing your message up and down the paper, like a snake. When looked at by anyone else, they\u2019ll only see a block of text that makes no sense when read from left to right. Sign your message with a small snake. Your friends will know how you\u2019ve written the message and how to read it. Meanwhile, no one else will know what it means."

This should be a common book that both you and the receiver of the message own. It must be the exact same edition so that the words and pages are in exactly the same places. Determine your method. Book ciphers often use three numbers separated by commas to denote information. (100,28,5) might mean that the target word is on the 100th page, the 28th line and the 5th word in that line. Write your messages using the method. Your \u201cwords\u201d will be made up of groups of numbers and almost impossible to break.
