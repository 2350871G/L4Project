A 2-hole button will not be the sturdiest, and for a pair of pants, which centers a great deal of pressure on the pants, a 4-hole button is preferable, particularly if there is only one. However, if the rest of the buttons are 2-hole buttons, it will do the job! Pierce the fabric below the button holes and pull through.

To reinforce the stitch, you should make at least as many loops around the button as you stitched through the fabric. Keep the loops tight so that you are successfully reinforcing the button. Pull the needle downward below to the button. Once again missing the button holes, pull the needle through the fabric below the button on the opposite side as where the needle came through. Tie off the button on the underside by making a loop. Use the excess thread to make a loop below the button and pull the needle through, tying a simple knot with the thread. You can repeat this process as many times as needed to make the button feel secure. Trim the thread directly above the knot to avoid undoing the knot by accident. Stitching Pants with a 4-Hole Button Choose a 4-hole button to match others, or for a sturdier hold. While 2-hole buttons are much easier to stitch, 4-hole buttons are a stronger choice, as you can stitch them with an 'X' pattern to keep them firmly attached to your pants. Use an 'X' pattern when stitching. As usual, enter the button hole by piercing the fabric behind and catching the needle on the other side. Then, insert the needle downward through the buttonhole diagonal to the one you came up through. Stitch in the same direction 4 to 5 times before switching to the other diagonal pair of holes. If there are other buttons that use a stitch that looks like two letter 'I's next to one another, called \u201cII\u201d stitches, you can stitch them to match by not crossing over to the diagonal hole when making the stitch. Instead, stitch through the hole straight across. Place a spacer below the button to leave enough room. An 'X' stitch in a 4-hole button is sturdy enough that it can be difficult to fit it through the buttonhole if it is sewn on too tightly. You can avoid this by using a piece of paper thin cardboard with a 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide 'V' cut into it and placing it below the button as you are stitching. The spacer should not block the button holes, but keep the button's edge sitting above the fabric. Create a thread shank. A thread shank will strengthen the button, and can be completed by following the shanking instructions above. You simply miss the button on your last upward stitch and wrap it around the button before piercing back down to the underside of the pants. Be sure to tie a knot below the button.
