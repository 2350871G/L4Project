          "description":"You can get the motivation you need just from imagining how beautiful and organized your house will look after you\u2019re done. This alone can make you feel like getting up and starting to clean. Look at pictures either online or in magazines of your ideal home. Imagine trying to get your own home as close to your vision of the perfect home as possible. Seeing how others organize and arrange their own houses can inspire you to make your home as beautiful as you can. You can even look at pictures of your house when it is in its ideal state for inspiration."

Kadi Dulude\t\t\tCleaning & Organization Expert\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: A clean room is so much more than just a clean room. When it's finished, you'll feel better because the air is fresh and your things are in place, and you'll enjoy being in your room. When you're done, be sure to sit down in your clean room and enjoy the feeling you have, and remember that feeling for the next time you need motivation to clean your room."

Ask your friend to check in with you every twenty minutes or so to check your progress. Just the feeling of having someone who is keeping track of your cleaning can be enough to motivate you to do it. You can also talk to your friend on speaker phone as you are cleaning. Talking with them will make cleaning more enjoyable, and they can check up on you to make sure you're cleaning."

This may seem like an extreme measure, but sometimes you need the pressure of other people seeing your home to really get the drive to clean. Make sure to give yourself enough time to clean before your guests come over."

If you aren\u2019t working within a certain timeframe, you are slower and more easily distracted so that cleaning can take all day. Setting an alarm will help you to stay focused on the task at hand. You can set an alarm for each room, or you can set an alarm for the amount of time you\u2019ll be cleaning in general. Setting a timer may also motivate you to do a race against the clock, so that you will be cleaning faster and more effectively."

Instead, do as much as you can manage for that day. Try and come up with a cleaning routine. Cleaning a few days a week for forty minutes each time is much more manageable than spending an entire afternoon cleaning."
