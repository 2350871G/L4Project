          "description":"Mixing 2 shades of the same color together is the best option for making minor changes to a red paint\u2019s color profile. Modify a red paint by mixing it with a darker shade of red that is the same brand and type of paint. Add maroon, burgundy, or crimson to a light red and mix it thoroughly with a mixing stick or brush so that the 2 shades combine thoroughly. This is the simplest way to make minor adjustments to your red. Stick to the same category of paint when mixing. If your base paint is acrylic, mix it with other acrylics. If your base paint is a semi-gloss oil-based paint, mix it with other semi-gloss oil-based paints. If you mix different types of paint, they may blend into an inconsistent texture or color. If you\u2019re working in low-light conditions, it can be hard to see a difference in a red paint when you mix it with another red."

          "headline":"Add a little bit of green paint to make a deeper red.",
          "description":"Complimentary colors can be combined to make different shades of brown. If you want to push a red into a darker shade without adding black, use a little bit of green to give your red paint a brownish undertone. Start with a combination that is 1-part green to every 10-parts red before increasing the amount of green that you\u2019re using. Darker colors will radically change a lighter paint rapidly. Err on the side of caution by starting with a conservative amount of green before you go further. You can identify a color\u2019s complimentary color by referring to a color wheel and looking for the color that is on the opposite side of your red. If you add black to a color, it will naturally absorb more light. Adding a little green is a good way to keep a red vibrant and vivid without making a room feel smaller or a painting appear flatter."

          "description":"A violet undertone will make a shade of red darker and deeper. Mix darker reds with softer blues and lighter reds with deeper blues to darken your red paint. Start by mixing 1-part of your analogous color and 10-parts of your red before you increase the amount of blue that you\u2019re adding.Tip: Mixing analogous colors often makes a paint feel dynamic and unique. If you\u2019re trying to make a statement on an accent wall or make a focal point pop, consider this option. Analogous colors refer to colors that are next to one another on the color wheel, like light green and bright yellow or dark orange and light red. If you use too much blue, your red will end up looking purple."

Black is the strongest color in terms of how potent it is at modifying a paint color, so work in smaller increments when increasing the amount of black in a mixture.Warning: It is very hard to reverse the changes to a color if you add black because it is such a potent pigment. In addition, black changes a color so quickly that it can be hard to identify how much you need.

Mixing a paint with gray instead of black means that you\u2019re adding some white to your color, which will create a more neutral impression. The white and the black will cancel each other out in terms of vibrancy, resulting in a flatter, muted red. Combine red and flat gray if you\u2019re trying to make your wall or painting feel neutral. If you\u2019re worried about making a room feel smaller when you paint a wall red and gray, use a lighter shade of gray. It will mute the red without making it feel dark.

Choose a red that is a few shades darker than your current red and apply it on top of your first coat to create a stronger color. This method works best with paints that are water-based or translucent. Watercolor paints don\u2019t often come in different shades. If you\u2019re painting with watercolors, use less water to make a color darker. You can use color swatches to identify the color of your wall. Hold up shades of red against the wall until you find a swatch that blends with your wall perfectly. Color swatches are normally organized with the lightest tone of a color on top of a slide and the darkest tone of color on the bottom. Move down 2-3 boxes on a slide to choose a tone that will mix well with your first coat."

If you\u2019re painting interior walls, this is easily done by taking your can of gloss paint to the store that you purchased it from and asking for a flat latex version of the same color.
