Apply the gel along window and door trims, behind the trashcan, and along the cabinet doors in your kitchen and bathroom. Also apply bait gel under sinks where the drainpipe enters the wall in your kitchen and bathroom. Apply gel bait in the crevices and cracks of your kitchen drawers, and along upper shelving and baseboards. If you have children or pets, then make sure to apply the gel in areas that are out of their reach."

Make sure to place the bait stations against the walls and in corners in high traffic areas like your kitchen and bathroom. Place bait stations behind the refrigerator, microwave, oven, toasters, toilet, and other major appliances in your kitchen and bathroom. Also place them underneath your dishwasher, refrigerator, oven, washer, dryer, and hot water heater. Identify high traffic areas by looking for roach droppings. Roach droppings resemble ground black pepper."

Also place these traps against the walls and in corners in high traffic areas. Place sticky traps in the same areas you place bait stations. Do not spray sticky traps and bait stations with insecticides or cleaning products. These will contaminate the baits. If the bait is contaminated, then the roaches will not enter."

The layer should be barely visible to your eye. Do not apply too much boric acid. If you do, then the roaches will be able to detect it and they will avoid the area.
