Creating the Dough Combine the egg white mixture with the egg yolk mixture. After you thoroughly mix the egg white mixture, pour the egg yolk mixture into the egg white mixture, scraping the bowl if necessary to get all the mixture out. Fold the ingredients together. Use a spatula or large spoon to fold the ingredients together, lifting up the mixture from underneath, then folding it over on itself. Fold the ingredients until they are just blended. Folding as opposed to rapidly mixing or churning will keep the dough light and airy as opposed to dense. Prepare two baking sheets. Spray two baking sheets with non-stick cooking spray or grease the sheets with butter. Greasing or spraying the baking sheets will stop the bread from sticking. Scoop the mixture onto the baking sheet. Use a large spoon to scoop the mixture into 10 equal-sized portions onto the baking sheets. Try to make roughly round portions that are approximately \u00be inch (1.9 cm)  thick and 4-5 inches (10-12.7 cm) in diameter. Baking the Bread Bake the bread in the oven for 30 minutes. Place the two baking sheets in the middle rack of the preheated oven. Bake the bread for about 30 minutes, until the tops are golden brown. Keep an eye on the bread. Some oven times vary, so be sure to pull out the baking sheets when the bread is golden brown on top. Place the bread on a cooling rack. Once the bread has finished cooking, take it off the baking sheets and place them on a cooling rack. You can also put the bread on a plate or counter if you don\u2019t have a cooling rack, though it may be denser if you don\u2019t use a cooling rack. Serve and enjoy. Serve the bread as soon as it\u2019s cool enough to eat. When the bread is fresh out of the oven, it is crumbly and airy, similar to the consistency of a meringue.
