Choose a post-emergent herbicide to kill the actively-growing grass. Spray the herbicide on your lawn as per the package directions. Post-emergent herbicides are available at your local lawn and garden shop. Use metsulfuron to kill the bahiagrass without harming a bermudagrass lawn. Use metsulfuron, sethoxydim, or atrazine to kill the bahiagrass without harming a centipedegrass lawn. Use atrazine to kill the bahiagrass without harming a St. Augustinegrass lawn.

Use a sharp mowing blade, as dull blades produce brown-edged grass. Keep bermudagrass and zoysiagrass at a height of 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm), centipedegrass at a height of 1.5 to 2 inches (3.8 to 5.1 cm), and St. Augustinegrass at a height of 2.5 to 4 inches (6.4 to 10.2 cm). Don\u2019t cut more than one-third of the grass height at a time, or the roots may stop growing. For instance, if you want to keep your grass at a height of 2 inches (5.1 cm), cut it when it reaches 3 inches (7.6 cm) tall."
