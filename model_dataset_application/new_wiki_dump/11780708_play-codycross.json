You'll start with Planet Earth but as you solve twenty groups, you'll finish a World and move on to the next World, such as Under the Sea and so forth. You'll see this world name inside the bright yellow \"sun\" near the top-center of the screen. You'll find back and forward jump buttons at both sides of each World, but moving between worlds won't work until you complete the existing groups in that World."

Each group has progress bars beneath them, and the group you are presently on will have a constantly-bouncing ID picture above it. Moving backward into already-solved groups will trigger a fail-safe, asking you whether you'd like to Restart the puzzle or Continue to correct your mistake. The letters to solved puzzle lines will be shown, but the clues will no longer be shown. There's a left-arrow in the top to skip back to the menus for the groups and so on."

Lines will have the same amount of letters to each word, but unlike a regular crossword puzzle, only one set of words or phrases will link together and is colored in a different color. The currently-selected line you are about to solve (momentarily) will be highlighted in yellow, but other lines will be white upon trying to solve. Solved lines will revert to the same color scheme and not allow re-entry into that line via the arrow buttons. The next designates your cheat/helps. For starters, they always give you one cheat - your CodyCross letter cheat - but using it will cost you one of your game-coins. The next will give you the clue for the across-word which is highlighted on the crossword box above in yellow. There should be one forward and one back button on this line too, to advance from line to line. Your special CodyCross keyboard will be shown at the very bottom of the screen and isn't used by any other apps. It's still in the Qwerty format, but it doesn't have an uppercase-lowercase system, numeric and emoji switcher, nor predictive text line. You can't enter by dictating words like you could've with phone-based keyboards."

Solved lines will turn navy-blue and copies of some of these letters might \"fly\" into other lines where they will be permanently placed as navy-blue tiles. Be prepared; CodyCross sometimes uses the same clue over and over and over again! And more towards the first World, CodyCross will often even turn around the words to make the same word. Except for the special down line, there are no ties to other words formed via the other correct line solves. Line answers (inside each row) will never be related to the world you're working on but will solve the clue\nLet your clues guide you to whether CodyCross wants a singular or plural word. Often, if the clue designates the plural form, the answer will almost always be a plural word. The same goes for the tense of some words (past tense clues refers to past tense verbs)."

Other cheats include random-letter solves (placing a bunch of unconnected letters on the board or simplifying your keyboard for the letters in that across-row for 2 coins) or a full-row solve for three coins."

Tapping it will allow you to switch on/off different settings that aren't commonly set, including the ability to give you harder clues (harder-mode), skip filled squares, erasing wrong words when typed into the boxes, selecting the first slot when you tap anywhere in a row, vibrating on every keypress, setting your country or language, and even a logout button for connecting to Facebook - which can also earn you coins."

If you buy the 56 tokens for $4.99 you'll be ad-free for one month, or with 120 tokens for $9.99, you'll be ad-free for three months. Other options cost more, with 320 tokens for $24.99 and 6 months ad-free, or 750 tokens for $49.99, with 1-year ad-free. Earn your 1 free token which you can get after you watch an advertisement.
