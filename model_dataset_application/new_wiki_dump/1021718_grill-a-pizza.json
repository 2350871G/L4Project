Most professional pizza ovens get much hotter than home ovens, resulting in a crispy crust. You can achieve a crispy crust at home by using a very hot grill. Your grill should be about 550, but 600 degrees is better (with the lid closed). Have your grill heating while you finish up with your ingredients."

Most stores sell pizza sauce already made in a small jar or can. If you can't find it, marinara sauce is a decent substitute. You can also use Alfredo sauce, too."

However, try not to get them too big, as it can be more difficult to flip. You'll need to turn the pizza as you roll to get it rolled out evenly. You'll also be fighting the elasticity of the dough. You don't want to get the dough too thin, as it can go through the grate. Keep it a little thicker than you would normally roll the dough. Lightly flour a pizza peel or other flat surface (like a pizza pan) to take the pizza out to the grill."

Brush the side that's sticking up with more olive oil, then let it cook for about 3 minutes with the lid open and then a couple minutes with the grill closed. Check it after a minute or two with the lid closed. The bottom should be starting to set up. You don't necessarily want that side crispy. Lift up the edge of the pizza with tongs to check it.

Cooking the Crust Roll out the dough. Flour a clean surface, and use a rolling pin to roll out the dough into your desired shape. Both round and square will work, as long as they fit on your grill. However, try not to get them too big, as it can be more difficult to flip. You'll need to turn the pizza as you roll to get it rolled out evenly. You'll also be fighting the elasticity of the dough.

The oil will help keep the pizza from sticking. You can use a plain olive oil, or you can use one flavored with another herb or seasoning, such as garlic, to add flavor to the pizza as you grill it. Oil the top side of the pizza. Oil is your friend when it comes to grilling pizza because the dough has a tendency to stick.

Check it after a minute or two with the lid closed. The bottom should be starting to set up. You don't necessarily want that side crispy. Lift up the edge of the pizza with tongs to check it.
