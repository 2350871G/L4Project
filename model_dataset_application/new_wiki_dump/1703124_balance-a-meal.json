Whole fruits and vegetables can include fresh, frozen, or canned items with no other ingredients (like sugar or salt) added. Equivalents of 1 cup of fresh fruit would be 1 cup of 100% fruit juice or \u00bd cup of dried fruit. Equivalents of 1 cup of fresh raw or cooked vegetables would be 1 cup of vegetable juice or 2 cups of leafy greens. Choose vegetables from all five subgroups: dark green vegetables, red and orange vegetables, legumes (beans and peas), starchy vegetables, and other vegetables."

          "headline":"Aim for whole grains.",
          "description":"Make about a quarter of any balanced meal consist of grains, with at least half of those grains being whole rather than refined. Grains include food made from wheat, rice, oats, cornmeal, barley or another cereal grain. Easy examples of foods that fall into the grain category are bread, pasta, oatmeal, breakfast cereals, tortillas, and grits. Whole grains are any grains that use the entire grain kernel, such as whole wheat flour, brown rice, oatmeal, whole cornmeal, and bulgur wheat. Look for \u201cwhole wheat\u201d on the labels of food you eat, and favor these items over refined wheat products like white bread, white rice, etc. Aim for a minimum of 3 \u2013 4 ounces of grain foods per day, or a recommended amount of 6-8 ounces. 1 ounce could be a \u00bd cup of pasta, rice, or oatmeal; one slice of bread; \u00bd an English muffin; or 1 cup of whole grain cold cereal."

          "description":"Choose proteins from a variety of different food sources for the healthiest level of nutrients. Aim for proteins to take up about a quarter of your plate for any balanced meal. Eat both animal proteins and plant proteins. Animal proteins include meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs. Plant proteins include beans and peas, nuts, seeds, and soy. Choose different plant and animal proteins for each meal or day so that you get a wide variety. Aim for about 5 \u2013 6 ounces of protein foods per day. 1 ounce of protein could look like 1 ounce of lean meat, poultry, or fish, or a \u00bc cup cooked beans or tofu. Note that proteins like seafood, nuts, and seeds can also be good sources of oils, which are another essential addition to balancing a meal. Look for meat and poultry that are low in fat and added sodium. Eat unsalted nuts and seeds."

          "description":"Drink or eat milk products to receive the calcium and other nutrients present in cow's milk. Favor low-fat versions to reduce fat intake. Aim for about 3 cups of dairy per day. A cup of dairy could mean 1 cup of milk, yogurt, or soymilk; 1 and \u00bd ounces of natural cheese; or 2 ounces of processed cheese. Dairy products are generally considered to be all foods made from cow's milk; however, products like butter, cream cheese, and cream are not generally considered part of this food group for nutritional purposes due to their low calcium content. And butter and cream are really made from fat."

Prep several portions of food to eat throughout the week, or eat dinner leftovers for lunch the next day, for a way to save time but still eat well. For a quick lunch, try a sandwich with two slices of whole grain bread, lettuce, onion, tomato, a slice of low-fat cheddar cheese, and a few slices of lunch meat. A side salad with two tablespoons of salad dressing and a single cup of 100% fruit juice could complete the meal. For a simple balanced dinner, try 1 cup of cooked carrots, 1 cup of steamed string beans, 1 cup of cooked brown rice, and a single grilled pork chop. Water or low-fat milk could serve as a healthy drink. When planning meals and shopping for ingredients, reduce or eliminate pre-packaged or prepared foods, sodas, salty snacks, and dessert foods.

You may not include all food groups in every small snack, but each snack should contain more than one type of food. For example, try a snack of apple slices and celery sticks with peanut butter to dip them in for a healthy snack that contains, fruit, vegetables, and some protein and oil. Eating snacks can be a great way to get a full day's worth of balanced nutrients if you get hungry between meals or have trouble eating substantial meals to contain enough food from each food group."

For example, diabetics may be advised to opt for whole grains over refined grains and restrict their dietary intake of fruits and fruit juices. Those with high cholesterol and heart disease may make animal products and fatty foods a smaller amount of their daily intake. Those needing to lose weight may put a heavier emphasis on vegetables and reduce the use of butter, oil, shortening, sugar, or salt when cooking.

If you are lactose intolerant, include lactose-free or lactose-reduced dairy products, or substitute cow's milk for non-dairy milks such as those made with almond, soy, coconut, rice, etc. Look for calcium-fortified foods and beverages, or foods naturally high in calcium like sardines, tofu, tempeh, kale, collard greens, and other leafy greens. If you are a vegetarian or have other restrictions on animal products, eat more plant proteins like beans and peas, nuts and seeds, and soy products to account for your daily protein intake.
