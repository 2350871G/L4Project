If you\u2019re dealing with the latter, the drain is likely clogged. You\u2019ll need to unclog the toilet. If the bowl isn\u2019t filling quickly enough, it could be an issue with the tank, like a low water level."

          "description":"The flapper is a piece of plastic or rubber which sits over the valve at the bottom of the tank. Unless your toilet isn\u2019t flushing at all, there should be a chain connecting this to the trip lever, a small arm running from the flushing handle. The chain should have just enough slack for the flapper to rest over the valve, sealing it. But it should be tight enough to lift the flapper when the flushing handle is used. When you flush the toilet, the flapper should stay open for 2-3 seconds. Otherwise, the bowl won't be getting enough water."

You can easily disconnect the chain, and place a different link through the hole to adjust the chain\u2019s overall length. The chain should be left with about half an inch of slack. Adjusting the chain means you may come into contact with the water in the toilet\u2019s tank. As long as you wash your hands afterwards, this is perfectly safe."
