Look for rocks, plant leaves and flowers, or insects you can preserve and keep on display. Take a walk down to a beach and look for sea glass. Another way is to begin to invest in an object you wish to collect, such as saving bottle-caps you\u2019ve found on the ground or gotten from your beverages. Others can help you begin or grow a collection by bringing you items such as coins or snow globes back home as gifts. Also consider buying a book on collectibles or joining a club of fellow enthusiasts."

          "description":"Many arts and crafts can be started with few materials. Writing, sculpting, drawing, and more will likely be available to you simply by using what you already have on hand. In addition, you can go to various stores, including dollar and thrift stores, to supplement your projects with cheap material such as scrap wood, fabrics, or metal. Search for craft projects on sites such as craftster.org or Pinterest and join art groups on Reddit. Look around your house before you begin. Often unused material can give you an idea for a project or help you complete one at low cost. You can use old electronics, wood, fabric, or paint to make miniatures, for example. Retail stores have some cheap supplies, such as coloring books and paint-by-numbers kits. Hobby stores will also have kits that can help you start doing activities such as building model planes or whittling."

Your local community center or library may offer free classes on anything from square dancing to programming, but you can also search local colleges and businesses for inexpensive classes. Sites such as khanacademy.org and coursera.org offer free classes on a variety of subjects. Youtube, podcasts, and phone applications are a great way to start. For example, try the free Duolingo application to learn a language."

Others, such as reselling, may require a more intensive investment to start but pay for themselves in time. Many hobbies have the potential to be monetized. The first goal with a hobby should be enjoying yourself. For example, when writing a blog or making online videos, don\u2019t expect to get paid. It may never happen."

Go online to a site such as eBay or a bulk store to get a lot of material at once. You can also purchase used clothing or get fabric scraps from a fabric shop for needlework hobbies such as sewing, for example. A cheaper option for a technology hobby is to rebuild old or broken computers. You can buy a computer or get it from someone you know. Selling creative products you make from cheap material helps you continue to fund your hobbies. You can always find beginner kits, such as paint-by-number sets or guitars that cost a fraction of an official model. These can be found at retail stores."

If you wish to continue with the hobby, you can continue to rent until you wish to buy your own equipment. Speak to people involved in your hobby to find places to rent equipment or try to borrow from people you know. Renting is useful for outdoor hobbies such as skiing or kayaking. Renting can also help you down the road for situational problems during your hobby, such as when you require a specific tool to use once in metalworking or gardening. Groups are also good for borrowing equipment. For instance, in a board game group, you can enjoy the games others bring without having to supply any games yourself. Computer companies also offer month-long trial versions of their products. Photo editors, for instance, can download Photoshop and buy after the trial."
