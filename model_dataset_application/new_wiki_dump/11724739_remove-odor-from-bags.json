          "description":"Sometimes, a good airing out is all a bag needs to smell better. Open the bag up and leave it outside for a day. Check it after a few hours to see if the smell has improved. If so, you don\u2019t have to take further steps to mask odors. Pick a nice day to air the bag out so it doesn\u2019t get rained on. Alternatively, you could leave the bag in your garage with the door open or a covered porch for a similar effect. Remember to bring the bag back inside to really test the smell. You might not fully smell odors outside."

          "headline":"Wipe the inside of the bag with a vinegar solution to remove smells.",
          "description":"Make a 1:1 solution of warm water and white vinegar. Add a drop of dish soap and stir it to make some suds. Then dip a clean sponge or rag into the mixture and squeeze it out. Scrub the inside of the bag with the damp sponge or rag, rewetting it as needed. Remember that the sponge shouldn\u2019t be soaked. Make sure it\u2019s only damp. If you aren\u2019t sure what type of material the bag is made of, put a small dab of this solution in a hidden spot and let it sit for a few minutes. If you don\u2019t see any discoloration or damage, then it should be safe for the rest of the bag. You can also load some plain vinegar into a spray bottle and lightly spritz the inside of the bag."

        {
          "headline":"Apply a store-bought deodorizing spray if the smell remains.",
          "description":"Open the bag up and spray a commercial odor eliminator, like unscented Febreze or Lysol, inside. Keep the bag open and let it air out. Once the spray dries, check to see if the odor is gone. You could use a scented product as well, but the smell may be a little overpowering. If you\u2019re cleaning a handbag, only spray the interior. It could leave a mark on the exterior, especially if the bag is leather."

          "description":"Baking soda can neutralize odors throughout your home, including inside your bags. Either sprinkle some into the bag, or put some in a plastic bag and leave it open inside the bag. Close the bag and give the baking soda a few hours to absorb the odors. You can also use a baking soda pod designed for refrigerators. This keeps the baking soda contained and you won\u2019t have to worry about making a mess with it."

Seal the bag up and let the kitty litter absorb the odor for up to a week. Place the bag somewhere it won't get knocked over. If the kitty litter spills out, it'll be difficult to get it all out of the bag."

          "headline":"Use dry coffee grounds for a potpourri effect.",

Twist the top and seal it with a rubber band. Then close the bag and leave it overnight to see if the smell improves. If you like the smell, you can leave the coffee grounds in the bag for a continuous effect. Put the filter in a safe place where it won\u2019t break open. You can try different coffee flavors, like French vanilla or hazelnut, for an even stronger effect."

Open up the sheet and spread it on the bottom of the bag. Take out the old sheet and add a new one when the fresh smell starts fading."
