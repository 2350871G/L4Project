          "description":"You can turn regular milk into evaporated milk by removing about 60% of the water. This means 30 ounces (3\u00be cups / 890 mL) of regular milk will make 12 ounces (1\u00bd cups / 350 mL) evaporated milk, the amount typically found in one can. You can use full fat, reduced fat, or skim milk. Non-homogenized milk (including raw milk) will separate into fat and liquid as you heat it. This makes it a poor choice for making evaporated milk unless you add an emulsifier, such as lecithin."

Depending on the pot size, stove temperature, and amount of milk, it can take anywhere from another twenty minutes to a couple hours to finish making evaporated milk. Alternatively, bring the milk to a low boil and stir constantly for ten minutes. This requires a deep pot to prevent boiling over, and comes with a high risk of a \"scorched\" taste. If you dislike a light brown color or caramel flavors, you can heat the milk below simmering, at around 160\u00baF (70\u00baC). It may take several hours to boil down, but the result will have a pure milk color and flavor."

Just keep a watchful eye on the pot and whisk at least once every five to eight minutes so the milk solids don't scorch. Reduce heat and whisk vigorously if the milk rises above a low simmer.
