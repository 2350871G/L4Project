However, you may need to take your newborn outside to catch a bus or to walk to your destination with them. Your newborn will be more susceptible to the cold when you go outside with them. Make sure that you dress them in warm clothes, such as long sleeved fleece pajamas, and appropriate outerwear, such as a coat, hat, mittens, warm socks, and booties. Layer your baby\u2019s clothing to ensure that they are warm enough and to make it easy to remove unneeded clothes when you are back inside with them. For example, you might dress your baby in a long sleeve onesie, a cardigan, and coat, plus a hat, mittens and warm socks and booties. Avoid bulky coats and sweater when you place your newborn into a car seat. Dress them in a few thin layers instead. Newborns and infants lose the most heat out of their heads. Make sure that the baby is wearing a warm hat whenever you leave the house."

          "description":"Babies can suffocate on loose blankets in their crib or bassinet, so do not place extra blankets in the crib or bassinet with your baby. Instead, use a sleep sack to keep your newborn warm at night. A sleep sack is like a wearable blanket for babies that goes right over your baby\u2019s clothes and zips up in front. Sleep sacks come in different styles. For example, you can get sleep sacks that include Velcro swaddle wraps as well, which can help to increase your newborn\u2019s sense of security. You can also get sleep sacks that are sleeveless and ones that have long sleeves. If you do not have a sleep sack, then you can also use a receiving blanket to swaddle your newborn, but make sure to keep the blanket under the level of their armpits."

          "description":"When you need to take your baby somewhere in their car seat, make sure to place a blanket over their legs and feet for extra warmth. This will help to protect your baby from the cold air as you take them to the car. Once your baby is in the car and the car has warmed up, you can remove the blanket if you think your baby is warm enough. If you have to be outside with your newborn for a few minutes to walk to the car or bus stop, then place a couple of heavy blankets over your newborn\u2019s abdomen, legs, and feet. Avoid attachable sleeping bags for car seats. These were once popular accessories for keeping babies warm in cars, but they are no longer considered safe for babies."

Watch your newborn for signs that they are too warm, such as skin that is flushed or reddish, warm to the touch, or sweaty. Rapid breathing is also an indication of overheating. Be aware that overheating is a risk factor for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), so it is crucial to avoid making your baby too warm."
