To clear the false alarm, enter your four-digit PIN again then press OFF. Testing Your Security System Enter your four-digit PIN then press TEST. Then press [0]. The alarm will sound for a few seconds, then the display will read \"Test\" or \"Test in Progress\". Open a door or window to test it. You should hear three beeps, followed by the name of the zone (if your security system is voice equipped). Bang near a glass break detector to test it. You should hear three beeps, followed by the name of the zone. Walk by a motion detector to test it. You should hear three beeps, followed by the name of the zone. Test a smoke detector by inserting an Allen key into the \"Test\" hole of the smoke detector. This will sound the fire alarm without notifying the fire department. Test all other security functions by calling your security company.  Deactivate test mode by entering your four digit PIN and pressing OFF, or by calling your security company. Should you forget to deactivate test mode, test mode will deactivate automatically after four hours. Bypassing a Security Zone Enter your four-digit PIN, followed by BYPASS, followed by the two digit code for zone to be bypassed. The keypad should beep once. Bypassing a zone disables it while armed. If a bypassed zone is tripped, the alarm system will simply ignore it. You have to bypass the zone every time you want to arm the security system, as bypassed zones are reset upon disarming the security system. Bypass all zones. Enter in your four-digit PIN, followed by BYPASS, followed by the \"#\" key. The keypad should beep for every bypassed zone. Sounding an Alarm Manually Hold down the appropriate letter key. Alternatively, press the specific two buttons. To sound a fire alarm, press the button with a pictogram of a fire for two seconds. Alternatively, press the two buttons with arrows from the fire symbol. To sound a security alarm, press the button with a pictogram of a police shield for two seconds. Alternatively, press the two buttons with arrows from the police symbol, or press the panic button on the keychain remote. To sound a medical alarm, use a medical pendant you are wearing or press the HELP button on the medical intercom. Alternatively, press the button with a pictogram of a medical cross for two seconds, or press the two buttons with arrows from the medical button. Enter your four-digit duress PIN in an emergency \"duress\" situation. If forced to disarm your security system, enter this four-digit code onto the security panel and press OFF. The system will act normally, but the police will be notified Immediately. There will be no notification (phone call or text message) that the dispatch center has received the alarm. The police may take up to 5 minutes to arrive. Make sure that everyone knows this PIN, and make sure that it is only used in an emergency. Changing, Adding or Removing a Security Code Enter your four-digit security code. Next press CODE, then the user number. The defaults are follows:\n01 is reserved for the installer code. 02 is reserved for the master code. 03/33 is reserved for the partition code. Follow the appropriate step: To add/change a user code, enter their code. The security system beeps once. To delete a user code, press # then 0. To change the permissions of that code, press # then 1 then any of the following:  0 is arm only. 1 is guest. 2 is duress code. 3 is master code. Clearing a False Alarm Signal Call the toll free number for your security company. The toll free number is usually written on any yard signs or on your security panel. Explain what happened. Say your passphrase. This is required to cancel your alarm. If you do not say it, then the police will be dispatched to your home. Be polite. Being rude will just aggravate the situation. Troubleshooting Check to see if the sensor is within range of the RF receiver and charged (if the sensor is wireless) or if the wires to the sensor are not cut (if the sensor is wired).  Check that the security system is receiving power. If your security system is displaying \"NO AC\" or \"AC LOSS\" on the screen, then make sure that there is no blackout in the area and that the outlet for the security system is receiving power. If your security system is displaying \"LO BAT\", then replace the battery on the security system (if no zones are displayed) or any zones displayed. The security system requires a lead-acid battery, and the sensors require alkaline batteries. Call the toll free number for your security company. The toll free number is usually written on any yard signs or on your security panel. Bypass any faulty zones. Until the security company provides you with the necessary resources to service your alarm, bypass them. When a service person does come to service your security system, check their credentials. You do not want them to break your security system even further.",
