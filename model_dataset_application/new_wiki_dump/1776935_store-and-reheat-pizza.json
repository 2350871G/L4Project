          "description":"If you take a little time when you\u2019re putting the pizza away, you\u2019ll end up with fresher-tasting leftovers, and the texture will be much more similar to the way it was originally. Start by putting a layer of paper towels or parchment paper on the bottom of a plate or a container that\u2019s big enough to hold 1 or 2 slices of your pizza. While it can be tempting to throw the whole box of pizza straight into the refrigerator, it can make your pizza soggy. The moisture from the tomato sauce, veggies, and meat will soak into the crust, making it hard to get the perfect texture no matter how you reheat the pizza. If you know in advance you\u2019re planning to freeze the pizza, it\u2019s better to use an airtight container, rather than a plate. In a Hurry? Let the pizza cool to room temperature, then place the slices in a resealable plastic bag. They might dry out a little more than they would if you layered them with paper towels, but they'll still stay fresher than putting the whole box in the fridge."

If you need to, divide the pizza onto more than 1 plate or container."

If you stored your pizza on a plate to start with, transfer it to an airtight container instead. However, do keep the paper towels between the slices. Defrost your pizza for about an hour on the counter before you re-heat it for the best results. Tip: If you buy a frozen pizza, it will often last in your freezer for about a year. However, these pizzas are flash-frozen commercially and designed to have a longer shelf life. To be safe, consume pizza you freeze yourself within 6 months."

          "description":"Preheat your oven to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) for 5-10 minutes, allowing it to come all the way up to temperature. When it\u2019s ready, place your pizza on a baking sheet, then place it in the oven for about 5 minutes. Whether you\u2019re heating up a whole pizza or just a slice, the oven is a great way to get a crispy crust with bubbly cheese that\u2019s similar to your original pizza. If you have a pizza stone, place the pizza on that. It will distribute the heat evenly, resulting in an even crispier crust. For easy cleanup, line your baking sheet with parchment paper before you place the pizza on it. Tip: If any of the toppings look soggy, wilted, or dried out, pick them off before you reheat the pizza."

Let the pizza heat for 6-8 minutes without removing the lid. When it\u2019s ready, you\u2019ll have a nice, bubbly top, warm toppings, and a beautifully crispy crust. Covering the pan allows the toppings to heat evenly while the crust is crisping on the bottom. If your skillet doesn\u2019t have a lid, cover it with foil, instead. After 6-8 minutes, if your crust is still soggy but the toppings are warm, take the lid off of the skillet and let it continue to heat for a few more minutes."

However, if you\u2019re in a hurry, sometimes it\u2019s the only way to go. To get the best possible texture out of the microwave, put a paper towel between the plate and the pizza, turn your microwave to 50% power, and nuke your pizza for about 1 minute.Tip: To keep the crust from getting soggy when you microwave it, try adding a glass of water. Place a microwave-safe glass that\u2019s about half-full of water into the microwave along with your pizza. The water will absorb some of the microwaves that are bouncing around, which will cause the pizza will heat more evenly."
