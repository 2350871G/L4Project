You'll need to cook and stir the roux for 30 to 45 minutes so it becomes dark in color. The roux should become a dark mahogany color. You can cool the roux and use it in your gumbo recipe. Don't worry if the roux looks thinner than traditional roux used for thickening. Roux for gumbo is meant to be thinner and more flavorful. If you don't want to use the roux right away, you can store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week."
