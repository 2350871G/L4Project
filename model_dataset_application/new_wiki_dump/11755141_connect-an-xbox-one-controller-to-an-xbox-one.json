  "text":" Connecting Wirelessly Turn on your Xbox One console. You'll see the power button on the right side of the unit if you have it positioned horizontally. Insert batteries into your controller. Some models of the Xbox remote, like the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 and the Xbox Adaptive Controller have built-in batteries and come with a USB-C cable for charging. Other models of Xbox controllers require AA batteries or rechargeable batteries to work. You can get an Xbox One Play & Charge Kit that comes with a rechargeable battery and charging cable. Press and hold the Xbox button on your controller. This is the large circular button centered in your controller with the Xbox logo. The button should flash to indicate that it's unpaired and looking for something to connect with. You can release the Xbox button on your controller when the button is flashing. Press the bind button on the console. If your Xbox One X or Xbox One S is horizontally positioned, you'll see this button on the right side of the unit's face, below the power button.
