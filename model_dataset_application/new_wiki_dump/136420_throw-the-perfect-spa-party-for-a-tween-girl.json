Buy the lipsticks and glosses, buy different colors of lipstick, maybe a soft plush pink, a juicy light berry-looking red that's appropriate for tweens, or a sparkly lipstick. There are many colors to choose from. Buy some blush, you can get a dusty rose, a caramel color, or a dark brown. Something that will complement the skin complexion instead of standing out.

Spin it in a circle and whoever it is facing has to paint just one of her nails that color. Whoever it landed on will spin the bottle next. Games like that.
