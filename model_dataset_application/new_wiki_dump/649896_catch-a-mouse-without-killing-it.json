  "text":" Preparing to Catch the Mouse Begin by cleaning your space. Mice are initially attracted to your cozy environment. If you clean out your house and make it less hospitable, mice will be less inclined to stay. Remove all clutter throughout your house. Don't leave out clothes, papers, or materials that mice could use to create nests. Don't forget to tidy up storage spaces, especially where paper goods or old clothes are kept. Clean up and seal away all food. Be incredibly through about this, as mice can make a meal out of almost anything. Wipe up crumbs from behind appliances and in cabinets.

Set this tube on the counter so that the end with the peanut butter hangs out over the trash can. If using a purchased live trap, be certain to follow the packaged instructions. Handling the Mouse Remove the mouse from the trash can while wearing gloves. Be sure to wear rubber, latex, or vinyl gloves since mice carry communicable diseases. Get your cleaning supplies out, so that you can immediately disinfect the space once the mouse is contained. You'll need a mixture of bleach and water in a spray bottle. Transfer mouse to a container. The mouse shouldn't be able to get out, but must have ventilation to breathe. Do not put the mouse in cardboard, since it can easily chew through cardboard containers. Now you can thoroughly disinfect your trashcan and countertops with a mixture of bleach and water after you've removed the mouse. Throw away the cardboard tube. Remove the mouse from your house.

You can increase its chance of survival if you release it near some kind of shelter. Avoid urban areas, where the mouse might simply return to another home, and wide-open spaces, where it can't find shelter from predators. Deterring Mice From Returning Clean and disinfect areas of mouse contamination. Open windows for ventilation  and spray any droppings with a mixture of bleach and water. The ratio of bleach should be one part to ten parts water. Do not sweep or vacuum up mouse droppings or nesting materials. These can kick up dust which could carry disease. Wait five minutes for bleach mixture to soak into the droppings. Then, use a paper towel to scoop up the droppings and throw away. Disinfect floors once you've cleaned the countertops by mopping with a bleach and water mixture. Remember to wash bedding in hot water and clean any upholstered furniture you think mice might have contaminated. Deter mice from coming back.
