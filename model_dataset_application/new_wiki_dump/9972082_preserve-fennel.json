Stored in a glass container, it will only last 3-5 days. Freezing Pre-Portioned Fennel Leaves Remove the leaves from the stalk to preserve fennel tops. Do so by cutting the leaves off with a knife, or by gently using your fingers to pull them from the stalk. Freeze small portions of fennel in an ice cube tray. Put about 1 spoonful of leaves in each section, then top the leaves with water and freeze the trays. This creates perfectly-portioned cubes that are easy to simply drop in soup and sauce recipes as desired. Transfer the frozen cubes to a storage container. Once the fennel ice cubes have frozen completely, transfer them to a plastic bag or storage container to keep them fresh. Blanching and Freezing Fennel Bulbs Separate the leaves from the bulbs. You can cut the leaves away or use your fingers to pull them off. Be careful not to bruise the bulbs, which could cause them to rot. Boil a large pot of water on high heat to blanch the bulbs. Once the water is boiling, add the fennel and continue to boil it for 30 seconds to 2 minutes, depending on how tender you want the bulbs. Blanching is essential to retain to the color, texture, and flavor of the fennel. Remove the fennel with a spoon and dip it into a bowl of ice-cold water.

Use glass or plastic containers with lids, or simple plastic freezer bags. When you are ready to use them, simply remove the fennel from the freezer, thaw it, and use as you would normally use a fresh bulb. Fennel can be stored in the freezer for up to 6 months. Pickling Fennel Cut a fennel bulb into thin slices. Using a sharp knife, cut the fennel into very thin,\u20444 inch (0.64 cm) slices and set aside. Combine pickling ingredients in a small saucepan and boil. Add 1 cup (240 mL) of white wine vinegar, 1 cup (240 mL) of water, \u20444 cup (59 mL) of sugar, and 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of coarse salt. Continue to boil the ingredients until the sugar and salt are completely dissolved. Experiment with adding additional flavors like orange or peppercorn, or find a recipe online for other options. Allow the liquid to cool for 5 minutes. Do not cool the liquid completely. It should still be warm when you begin the next step. Add the fennel. Allow the fennel to steep in the liquid for about 20 minutes. Use it immediately, or place it in canning jars to store it for up to 1 week in the refrigerator. Use the pickled fennel as a topping on salads or meat dishes. Drying Fennel Seeds Remove the seed heads from the fennel stalk. Using a knife, carefully cut the seed heads off of the plant. If you handle the heads too roughly or quickly, you may lose a lot of seeds, so be gentle. You can dry the fennel leaves as well, but it usually isn\u2019t recommended because they tend to lose most of their flavor during the process. Place the seed heads in a paper bag and shake the bag firmly. You can be rough here. The goal is to break the seeds loose from the head. Firmly shake the bag up and down for about 30 seconds. Separate the seeds. Remove the rest of the plant matter from the bag. Check the heads to be sure the seeds have been released, and if not, use your fingers to remove them. Spread the fennel seeds evenly on a drying screen. Allow the seeds to dry out in a warm, ventilated space for 2-4 days.
