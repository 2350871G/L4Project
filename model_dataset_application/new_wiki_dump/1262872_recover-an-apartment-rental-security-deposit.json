This can also tell you a lot about the quality of the landlord. Repainting is always considered normal wear and tear, and is not grounds for someone to lose a deposit. Nail holes are covered up by painters as a normal part of their work--generally not even considered a repair--and your landlord knows it. So if the landlord answers that they charge tenants for repainting and filling in nail holes, it should tell you they take advantage of their tenants."
