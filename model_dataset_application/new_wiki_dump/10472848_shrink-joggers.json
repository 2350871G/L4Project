Turn the machine on, select the hot wash option, and press start. If you\u2019re joggers are dirty, read the instructions on your laundry detergent packet and add the powder or liquid as directed. If the joggers are clean, there is no need to add detergent. This method is most effective for joggers made from natural fibres such as cotton, linen, or wool. Choose the longest wash cycle available. This will give the joggers more exposure to hot water which will help encourage them to shrink."

If your joggers have any prints on them, turn the pants inside out before placing them in the dryer. This will help to protect the prints from being damaged by the heat and agitation of the dryer."

If you are unhappy with the size, put them through another hot wash and drying cycle. Continue to repeat the process until you are happy with the size of the joggers or until they stop shrinking. The joggers will not normally shrink more than 1 size."
