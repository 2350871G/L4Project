Light these grills 30\u201345 minutes before you cook the chicken, waiting until the charcoal turns white and the flames die down. You may use a gas barbecue instead, which could only require 15\u201320 minutes of heating before use. If you plan to marinade the ingredients, which is optional, you may wish to wait until that step before you light the barbecue. Binchotan charcoal is favored by yakitori chefs due to its long burning time and minimal odors. However, a fire starting pan may be required to light binchotan charcoal. While grilling is by far the most common method of cooking yakitori in Japan, instructions are also included below for frying pans and broilers."

Chop larger pieces in half lengthwise if necessary to keep pieces roughly the same size. Optionally, the thinner, dark green pieces can be chopped finely and used as garnish on the final dish. Chopping the scallions first allows you to use the same knife and cutting board for the chicken. If you cut the chicken first, wash the knife and cutting board immediately afterward, to reduce the chance of contamination from raw meat."
