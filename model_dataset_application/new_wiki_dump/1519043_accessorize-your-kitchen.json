Think about how you want your kitchen to feel and then choose a theme that best matches that atmosphere. If you already have a theme in your home, consider using this in your kitchen as well. For example, if you want your kitchen to feel crisp and clean, opt for a minimalist or Scandinavian theme. If you want a relaxed feeling in your kitchen, opt for a beachy theme. French country, modern, shabby-chic, and art-deco are other popular themes that work well for kitchens."

This will help your kitchen look cohesive, which helps to create a nice, calm feeling in the space. For example, if you have a Nordic theme, opt for tea towels that are blue or red, or have anchors or waves on them. If you have a minimalist theme, pick accessories that are black, white, or have geometric patterns. Old style kettles and vases are a great way to create a vintage theme. Pick white-washed items if you have a shabby-chic theme. Brass and steel accessories help to create an industrial feel in your kitchen."

If you have flowers growing in your garden, put them in a vase to display them. If you find it difficult to keep plants alive, opt for artificial plants instead!

Consider placing your children's artwork in frames to give your kitchen a personal touch."

Retire your plastic scrubbing brush or sponge and replace it with a wooden scrubbing brush. If you leave your tea towels on display in your kitchen, replace them with pretty, clean ones. If you are using an old container as a fruit bowl, consider investing in a nicer looking one. Wire, wooden, and ceramic fruit bowls are all beautiful options."

Driftwood lampshades work well for beach themed kitchens, wire lampshades are a great option for minimalistic kitchens, and chandeliers help to create a luxurious feel. Consider permanent light features for a luxurious look. Chandeliers and naked bulbs are great options! If the space feels dark, choose bulbs with a high wattage."

If your kitchen is quite large, it can help to break it up into different areas, creating a designated cooking space that's separate from the rest of the room. Steel, tile, or glass splashbacks are all popular options. Choose a mirrored splash back to make your kitchen look bigger and lighter. Opt for a white splashback to make your kitchen feel crisp and clean. Choose a granite or quartz splashback if you want a bold look."
