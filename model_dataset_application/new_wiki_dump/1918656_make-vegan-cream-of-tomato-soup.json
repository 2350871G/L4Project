  "text":" Preparing the Rosemary Croutons Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) and spray a flat baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray.  Toss the bread cubes, olive oil, garlic and rosemary in a large bowl, using either a spoon or clean hands. Make sure that all the ingredients are well combined. Spread the cubes onto the baking sheet. Bake them for 12 to 15 minutes, depending on the desirable crispiness you wish. Remove the croutons from the oven and set the baking sheet on your range top so the croutons can cool.  Preparing the Tomato Soup Place the onion, garlic cloves, coconut oil and tomato paste into either a blender or a food processor.  Puree the mixture until it is smooth.
