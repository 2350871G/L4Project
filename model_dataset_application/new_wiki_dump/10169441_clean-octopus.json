Removing the Beak Spread the tentacles to locate the beak. The beak is found amid the start of the tentacles. It is black and looks similar to a bird\u2019s beak. The beak is used by the octopus for predation, and is similar in structure to a fingernail. It is solid, muscular, and inedible; not something you want to find in your dish!

Firmly press the soft surrounds of the beak using your thumbs. This will push it through to the other side so that it can be disposed. Rinsing the Octopus Hold the octopus under cold running water. If the head is still attached, begin with it flipped inside out to make sure that any remaining entrails are washed away. Then turn the head back the right way around to rinse off the outside. It can help to have a large bucket in the sink when you are rinsing the octopus, as the process can get slippery. Flush the eye sockets. Run each empty socket under the cold water.
