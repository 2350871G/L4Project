By asking people to take off their shoes before they have stepped onto your hardwood floors, you are lowering the chances that dirt, rocks, or scuffed shoe soles will cause any damage to your flooring. Some people opt to offer their guests slippers to wear around the house after they have removed their shoes."

You and your guests will have a space to wipe off and remove your shoes before stepping onto the hardwood floors. The right rug can really tie a room together! Visit your local home decor store or look online for a rug that will match your style and protect your floors at the same time."

Felt tips are easy to apply and can make a world of difference when you are trying to keep your floors pristine. Giving your floors a sweep every couple of days will prevent any dust or debris from getting beneath your furniture legs and rubbing against the wood floor."
