Squash that are larger or overgrown are often mealy, but they're perfect for baking. Pro tip: scour the farmer's market right before it closes.

Leave the skin on summer squash. Unlike winter varieties, the skin of summer squash is one of the most edible and flavorsome parts of the squash. There's no need to remove it, unless you don't want it there for cosmetic reasons. Remove some of the moisture from the squash by salting it gently before you cook with it. This will bring some of the water to the surface, which you can rinse off by running the sliced squash under the water once more.

Probably the most common way of preparing squash for this dish would be to cut it into disc-shaped slices, then fry them on both sides. They'll cook relatively quickly.

If you want, put the other half of the squash back on the \"boat\" before you close it up in aluminum foil, to make a full stuffed squash (good if you overload it with fixings!) or you can use every half for a separate boat, depending on how much you need to make.

Rotate the squash a few times to ensure an even cook, but otherwise leave them alone. Always put the lid back on when you're cooking squash, to ensure that the heat cooks the insides, as well as the bottom. Check the packages or the squash directly every five minutes or so to check for doneness. If you put them in a package, the squash will be done when the package is steaming and smells fragrant, and the squash is fork-tender. Open up a package carefully and check one to be sure."

It's a great way of using up as many summer squash as you want, and is perfectly for one of those mid-September cold snaps. This recipe calls for 4-6 small-medium squash, grated coarsely, and serves 3-4 people. Use a box grater or a plane grater after trimming off the ends of the squash. Run the squash through the coarsest setting. If you want the squash more fine, run it through whichever setting you wish. Salt and squeeze the grated squash to remove some of the water, and rinse it thoroughly in a colander. Squeeze the rest of the water out of it and prepare the rest of the vegetables."

You don't have to \"toast\" the rice, so this step only takes a very short amount of time. Warming the jasmine helps to bring out some of the flavors.

Stirring the egg and lemon vigorously, add small spoonfuls of the broth from the soup, very slowly, to bring the temperature up and cook the egg without curdling it. Go slowly and keep stirring. When the egg mixture is steaming in the bowl, it's done, and you can pour it into the soup pot, while stirring it in. This will thicken and flavor the soup. If the idea of tempering eggs grosses you out, or if you'd rather not have them, add the lemon juice directly into the soup and thicken the soup with cornstarch or flour, if desired."

It's a great way of using up as many summer squash as you want, and is perfectly for one of those mid-September cold snaps. This recipe calls for 4-6 small-medium squash, grated coarsely, and serves 3-4 people. Use a box grater or a plane grater after trimming off the ends of the squash. Run the squash through the coarsest setting. If you want the squash more fine, run it through whichever setting you wish. Salt and squeeze the grated squash to remove some of the water, and rinse it thoroughly in a colander. Squeeze the rest of the water out of it and prepare the rest of the vegetables. Dice additional vegetables. There's plenty of room to add whatever vegetables you like to this dish, or you can just go with a simpler squash-and-rice version if you're not a veggie-head. You've really got to try it with the following additions, though:\nOne inch of grated ginger\n2 medium carrots, peeled and chopped\nOne small-medium white onion, chopped\n3-4 cloves of garlic, minced\nOne bunch of chopped Italian flat-leaf parsley\nBrowned sausage or bacon (optional) Sautee vegetables over medium heat in olive oil. Start in a pot big enough for a sizable pot of soup, and saut\u00e9 the onions, garlic, carrots, and ginger until the onions become translucent. This should take 5-7 minutes. If you want to add sausage, bacon, or other meats to this recipe, cook the meat in the bottom of the pan first, remove it from the pot, and return it back in 5-10 minutes before its done cooking. Add 3/4 cup of jasmine rice. Measure out some jasmine rice, rinse it in clean water to remove dust and sediment from the grains, and add the rice directly into the onion mixture at the bottom of the pot, and stir it for 1-2 minutes, until the rice becomes fragrant. You don't have to \"toast\" the rice, so this step only takes a very short amount of time. Warming the jasmine helps to bring out some of the flavors. If you don't have jasmine rice, plain white rice, short grain brown rice, or any variety would be perfectly fine as a substitution. Use what you like. Add the grated squash. As soon as the rice becomes fragrant, add the squash to keep it from browning or burning. Stir the squash quickly to coat everything in the mixture, and keep stirring it for a minute or two to coat it thoroughly. Add four cups of water or chicken stock. Depending on how big your squash are, and how big a pot of soup you want to make, you can mess around with this amount. Read the directions on the rice you have to make sure you've got enough water to cook the rice to doneness, plus two cups. You can add water if necessary. Bring the soup to boiling, then reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer. The rice should take approximately 20-30 minutes to cook, which should be the perfect amount of time for bringing the flavors together. It's usually best to cook with the lid on the pot, slightly askew, and to lower the temperature so it's at a gentle simmer, just barely boiling. Temper the soup with egg and lemon. When the rice appears done, beat two eggs into a heat-resistant bowl with the juice of one lemon, then temper the egg mixture and add it to the soup to thicken it. Stirring the egg and lemon vigorously, add small spoonfuls of the broth from the soup, very slowly, to bring the temperature up and cook the egg without curdling it. Go slowly and keep stirring. When the egg mixture is steaming in the bowl, it's done, and you can pour it into the soup pot, while stirring it in. This will thicken and flavor the soup. If the idea of tempering eggs grosses you out, or if you'd rather not have them, add the lemon juice directly into the soup and thicken the soup with cornstarch or flour, if desired. Season the soup liberally. It's important to wait to season the soup until after you've tempered it. Very salty broth can curdle eggs more quickly, rather than tempering them. Perfectly edible of course, just not quite the texture you're looking for. Season this soup with salt and black pepper. If you want, a little cayenne also goes nicely with this basic recipe, and you can season it however you prefer. Top with fresh chopped parsley and grated parmesan. After tempering the soup, remove the lid and let it continue cooking gently for 5 or 10 minutes, just to let the flavors come together. Taste it to check for salt and serve with fresh chopped parsley and grated parmesan cheese on top. Serve with a lemon wedge. Trying Other Recipes Make ratatouille. A classic of French cooking, ratatouille uses summer squash and the related eggplant as a centerpiece of simplicity. Its late-summer cuisine at its finest, and it's pretty easy to make with fresh vegetables. In a pot, saut\u00e9 a diced green, yellow, and orange pepper, in olive oil, adding two cloves of minced garlic, a half cup of diced onion, and three diced tomatoes. Season with thyme, bay leaf, and kosher salt. Remove from heat when the tomatoes are broken down and the mixture has the consistency of a sauce. Spoon the tomato mixture into the bottom of a cast-iron skillet, a dutch oven, or another baking-ready cooking vessel. Set the oven to 275, and top the tomato mixture in the skillet with 3-4 various summer squash, sliced into rounds, and one smallish eggplant, sliced into rounds, and top it with 3-4 cloves of minced garlic, salt, pepper, and olive oil. Cover the skillet with foil, roasting for about two hours, then remove the foil and bake it for 30 minutes more. Sprinkle some balsamic vinegar and fresh chopped herbs over the top to serve. Make summer squash rice. Integrating some grated squash into a rice dish can be an excellent way to spice up plain-old rice, either as a side or as a centerpiece dish. This recipe goes incredibly well with any type of curry or Indian dish. Coarsely grate two small-medium summer squash, and saut\u00e9 gently at the bottom of a pot with onions and garlic. Season with one tablespoon each of cumin and coriander powder, and a 1/4 teaspoon of turmeric. Stir. Add a cup of jasmine rice to pot and stir until fragrant. Add 2 1/2 cups of water, bring to a boil, cover and reduce heat to low. The rice should be done in 30-40 minutes. Serve topped with chopped cilantro, raisins, and sliced almonds. Make a raw summer squash salad. Summer squash is perfectly tasty when eaten raw, and this cold salad is perfect as a side dish for hot summer days, or even as a topping for burgers or hot dogs. It has a consistency and taste a bit like cole slaw. Grate three or four small-medium squash, and mix in a bowl with one medium grated carrot, half a red onion, sliced finely, some minced bell pepper, a minced clove of garlic, a sprinkling of sunflower seeds, and a bunch of chopped parsley. Dress the salad with two tablespoons of good olive oil, a tablespoon or so of balsamic vinegar, the juice of half a lemon, and salt and pepper to taste. If you'd prefer, you could also dress the salad in any commercial bottled salad dressing you like. Make squash fritters. Squash fritters are bit like potato pancakes, but with a slightly different texture, and more colorful to boot. These are great topped with applesauce, tomato sauce, coleslaw, or just eaten solo. This recipe yields about 20 fritters. Grate, salt, and squeeze 4-5 small or medium squash, rinsing them thoroughly to get the water out. Grate half a medium white onion, as well, and mix with the squash in a bowl, adding a cup of white flour, one half teaspoon each of salt and sugar, and an egg. Mix thoroughly. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat, until shimmering, and add a spoonful of the fritter mixture. Cook on each side 3-4 minutes, or until golden brown, then remove and blot with paper towel to remove excess grease.",
