          "description":"You can use this theme for any birthday, but it works especially well for first birthdays and other milestone birthdays like turning 16, 30, or 40. Go with banners, balloons, and party favors that announce the person\u2019s age and make sure that the age number appears prominently throughout the d\u00e9cor. For example, for a first birthday, the d\u00e9cor and party favors can feature the number \u201c1\u201d or say \u201cHappy 1st Birthday!\u201d on them. The cake and Mylar balloons can be shaped like the number \u201c1,\u201d as well. You can also base color choices on the age. For example, a Sweet 16 party can be decorated in shades of pink. Black and gold decorations are popular for 40th birthday parties with an \u201cOver The Hill\u201d theme."

          "headline":"Base the theme around the season for an easy option.",
          "description":"Seasonal themes are great options that never go out of style. They're also extremely customizable and you should be able to find decorations at your local craft store or online quickly and easily. If you aren't sure what kind of theme to go with or if you don't have much time for planning, consider a seasonal theme! For example, a summer birthday party can have a tropical color scheme and feature beach themed decorations. If the party is in the fall, you could have a burgundy, brown, and orange color scheme and use autumn-themed decorations featuring leaves, pumpkins, cornucopias, and pinecones. The season can also dictate activities for the party. For example, you can have pumpkin carving or pumpkin painting activities at a kids\u2019 autumn-themed party. Bobbing for apples is another fun idea for fall!"

        {
          "headline":"Feature a favorite animal, sports team, or other interest in the d\u00e9cor.",
          "description":"You probably know the person well enough to pinpoint one of their favorite hobbies or interests, but if you aren't that close to them, don't be afraid to ask someone who would know! Finding decorations that match a very specific or obscure interest may not be feasible at your local craft store, so try looking online instead. For example, a child who loves unicorns might love a unicorn-themed party with unicorn imagery and pastel decorations. If the person loves Harry Potter or Star Wars, you could go with decorations that reflect those interests. A football or hockey themed party would work great for a sports lover, and you can even zero in on a specific team and use the team colors for your color scheme. Create a Disney-themed party with decorations featuring their favorite Disney characters and settings."

          "headline":"Go all out with a location-based theme for a creative solution.",
          "description":"Transform the party space by creating an atmosphere based on a location. Depending on what you choose, this may be the  most work-intensive choice, but if you have plenty of time for planning and have a creative streak, consider making a big splash with this approach. Go with a location or atmosphere that you know the person really loves! For example, create a carnival-themed party with brightly colored or striped d\u00e9cor, carousel imagery, tents, clowns, and lollipops. You could also consider a garden theme, a castle theme, or a zoo theme. Jungle, safari, and outer space themes are also very popular."

You can also try something more on-theme; for instance, for a royal-themed party, create a scroll-shaped banner with a message like, \u201cHear ye, hear ye! It\u2019s The Queen\u2019s birthday!\u201d\nFor a disco-themed party, you could have a banner with an iconic disco quote like, \u201cLet\u2019s get down tonight!\u201d, \u201cStayin\u2019 Alive\u201d, or \u201cShake your groove thang!\u201d\nHang the banner somewhere prominent so that everyone can see it!"

You could also create themed garlands using paper or cardboard cutouts. For example, use flower-shaped cutouts for a garden party, a string of cardboard crown cutouts for a royal-themed party, or T-rex cutouts for a dinosaur-themed party. String together photos to create a very personal garland. For an 80s themed dance party, string together paper cutouts of boomboxes and stereo speakers."

Balloon solutions can be simple or elaborate, depending on what you want to do and how much time you have. For example, for an easy option, blow the balloons up yourself with an air pump and scatter them around the room or tape them to objects. You can also rent a helium tank, fill the balloons, and either tie them to objects in the room or simply let them float along the ceiling. For a quick option, go with Mylar balloons in different shapes and colors and have the party store fill them with helium for you. Go all out by creating a balloon arch."

Images that include their friends and family members are also a great idea, especially those that you know will be in attendance at the party. You may want to print the images from digital files to prevent original photographs from getting damaged, though. For example, you could include pictures from their very first birthday party, a summer vacation, and dancing at prom. You can also create the collage as a keepsake and include blank space for the party goers to write birthday messages and well-wishes."

You can keep things simple and go with plastic, solid-colored table coverings that match the party\u2019s color scheme. You can also use on-theme printed tablecloths, like galaxy prints for an outer space theme or colorful stripes for a carnival theme. You can buy printed tablecloths for almost any theme you can imagine, or you can make them yourself using butcher paper, printed images, and glue. For a ruffled look, buy several tablecloths in a few different sizes and layer them on each table. Collage printed photographs on craft paper to make a customized, personal print!"

You can use plain confetti, or go with an on-theme solution like star-shaped confetti for an outer space theme. Scattering glitter or sequins on the tables can create a similar effect and may even work better if you\u2019re doing a disco or carnival theme."

If you have trees that are fairly close together, drape the lights between them. You can also wrap the lights around tree trunks and thread them through the foliage. Buy colored lights to match the party's theme or go with white lights for a classic look. You can also find delicate fairy lights that come with battery packs if you don't have access to electricity. Attach lightweight Chinese paper lanterns to the string in between the lights to create even more ambiance."
