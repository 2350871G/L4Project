With enough sunlight and the right temperature, indoor bamboo plants add a great green accent to your living space.

In a container, the bamboo won\u2019t grow as tall is it would in the ground outside. Generally, a bamboo plant will reach about 75% of its maximum possible height if it\u2019s grown in a container. Container bamboo species include Yellow Groove, Viridis, Albostriata, and Alphonse Karr.Planting Tip: Choose a container bamboo if you have a small outdoor space or you live in a location where you need to bring your bamboo plants inside during cold weather."
