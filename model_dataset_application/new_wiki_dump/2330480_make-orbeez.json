          "description":"Visit a craft store or toy store to find Orbeez, and choose a package in your favorite color or get a mixed package. If you plan on making a lot of Orbeez,\"look for multi-packs, which can contain up to 10,000 Orbeez pellets, to save money. Otherwise, stick to packages of 100, 200, or even 500 Orbeez. If you can\u2019t find Orbeez in a store, you can order them online through the company\u2019s website or Amazon."

          "description":"Use a pair of scissors to open the packet, making sure not to spill any of the tiny Orbeez on the ground. Carefully empty the contents of the package into a large bowl. If you do spill the Orbeez on the floor, you can use a vacuum to clean them up. After you sweep them up, empty the vacuum chamber and dispose of the spilled Orbeez."

          "headline":"Add 1 cup (240 mL) of warm water for every 100 Orbeez.",
          "description":"Use filtered water to make the largest beads, and carefully pour the water over the beads in the bowl, making sure that none of the water splashes out. Make sure you have enough water for the Orbeez, since they\u2019ll absorb the water as they grow and expand in the bowl. If you want to preserve the Orbeez and play with them for a long time, add a pinch of salt to the water. The Orbeez won\u2019t be as large, but they will retain water for longer. If you don\u2019t have filtered water, you can still make your Orbeez. They might be a bit smaller than ones made with filtered water, but they\u2019re still fun to play with!"

          "description":"The Orbeez will slowly grow to about 100 times their original size in the water. Check on them every hour to make sure there\u2019s enough water for them in the bowl. If not, add an additional 1 cup (240 mL) of water. For very large Orbeez, replenish the water after 4 hours and leave them to soak overnight. If the Orbeez aren\u2019t perfectly round, that means they haven\u2019t soaked up enough water. Leave them in the water until they\u2019re perfect spheres."

        {
          "headline":"Play with your Orbeez!",
          "description":"Run them through your fingers, bounce them on the ground, or play a fun game with them. If you drop one of the beads on the floor, pick it up to avoid slipping or falling, since Orbeez can be slippery. Play mini bocce ball, where you and your friends try to get your Orbeez close to a target ball, like a marble. You can use different color Orbeez for different teams, and each team can take turns rolling the target ball. Try playing bullseye with a friend and two different colors of Orbeez. Simply draw a bullseye on a sheet of paper and take turns with your friend trying to roll an Orbeez into the center of the bullseye. Play Orbeez croquet with your friends. You can fold pieces of paper or use paper clips to create your course \"hoops.\" Create an Orbeez obstacle course, like putt-putt golf. Challenge your friends to get Orbeez through the course in as few tries as possible. Use different colored Orbeez to play classic games, like marbles or Chinese checkers."

        {
          "headline":"Store the Orbeez in a resealable bag or container.",
          "description":"When you are finished playing with them, put them into a container with a lid or a plastic bag with a zipper. Make sure the container is completely closed and airtight, and store them for up to a week. If your Orbeez accidentally dry out, don't worry. Just re-soak them in warm water to make them grow again. If your Orbeez smell moldy, throw them away and grow a new package."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Dispose of your Orbeez in the trash or by reusing them in your garden.",
          "description":"When you\u2019re done playing with your Orbeez, never rinse them down the drain. Instead, throw them away or mix them into the soil of your potted plants, where they will help the soil retain moisture. Orbeez were originally developed to slowly release water into soil, watering plants gradually. As they sit in the soil, they will release their water and become smaller. If you mix them into the soil, you won't have to water your potted plants as often."

Then, put the finished water marbles in a container and let your children play with them between their fingers. Some of the games recommended for store bought Orbeez might not be ideal for your homemade batch. Starch can dry and leave a glue-like trail behind, so you should plan accordingly when you play games with your homemade water marbles.
