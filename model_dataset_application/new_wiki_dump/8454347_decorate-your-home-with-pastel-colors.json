          "description":"If you only want to add small touches of pastel to your home, then adding small accessories is the best way to do it. For example, in the kitchen you could put out a light blue butter dish. In the living room, look for light green coasters. In the bedroom, add a lampshade in a light pink or purple color. For a bold look, choose all pastel accessories. Or, simply add a few here and there."

          "description":"A good way to add a touch of pastel to your home is to put pastel throw pillows on your couch, chair, or bed. Consider the colors that you already have in your room when choosing pillows. Choose colors that would pair well with the existing colors in the room. If you have a lot of neutral colors in the room, almost any color will work, like light pink, green, blue, or yellow. Colors like light yellow and purple are great for creating a relaxing environment. You could also put a pastel throw blanket on your couch or bed."

You can leave them set out on the table to show off at all times, or only set them out when a meal is being served. Look for pastel tableware at any home decorating store, or at big-box stores. For a feminine and glamorous feel, pair the pastels with metals like gold and brass."

Set them outside of your door, or put your indoor plants inside of them. You can choose one color, or choose an array of colors for a cheery look. Put a few planters in various sizes and pastel colors together for a fun, colorful vignette."

Look for a bedding set with a comforter (or duvet cover), sheets, and pillowcases. They can be in a solid color, or in a design, like stripes. If you don't want all of your bedding to be in pastels, just buy a comforter. Pastels can add a soothing effect to your bedroom. If you don't want the bedroom to appear to \u201cgirly,\u201d you can choose pastel colors like light blue and green."

Stencils are usually made of flexible plastic. Stencils in the shape of flowers and geometric patterns are especially common for walls. Make sure not to get paint outside of the stencil.

You can choose to paint just the molding near the ceiling, or all of the molding in the room. Consider the color your wall is before choosing a pastel color.

The best wall to paint is the one that is directly in front of you when entering a room, or the wall that the couch side tables are in front of.

Painting a room in a pastel shade can make a small room appear larger."

If you are reupholstering on your own, make sure to purchase fabric made specifically for reupholstering furniture. It will only be a decorative piece of furniture if you don't.
