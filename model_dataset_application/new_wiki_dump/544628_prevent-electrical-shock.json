In basic terms, electricity naturally tries to flow to the earth or ground through any and all materials that will conduct an electrical current. Certain compounds, like wood and glass, are poor conductors of electricity. Other materials, like seawater and many metals, conduct very well. The human body is able to conduct a current largely due to the amount of sodium and water in the body, and an electric shock happens when electricity flows through parts of the body. This happens most often when a direct source of electricity is exposed to human contact. It may also flow into a person through another conductor, like a pool of water or a metal pole. To learn more about electricity and the cause of electric shock, read about it here or ask a trusted electrician."

However, any time you are having serious or major electrical issues, you should hire a professional electrician. It may be expensive, but it is cheaper than a stint in the hospital. There are essentially two types of electricians you can hire, \u201cmaster\u201d electricians and \u201cjourneyman\u201d electricians. Both types are usually licensed by the state - but not always. Master electricians generally own businesses and can employ other licensed electricians and helpers or apprentices, while journeyman electricians can work for a master electrician or be self-employed and hire a single helper or apprentice. The rules of what each type of electrician may do and may not do varies by state, county or locality."

This helps to ensure that, even if you make a mistake, you won't be electrocuted. There will be a main electrical panel somewhere in your home (usually in a basement or garage). This panel has a simple on/off switch that allows you to cut the flow of electricity to your entire house.

You need to be aware of these mistakes and take all the necessary precautions to avoid. Some things to avoid are:\nAvoid touching a bare wire that may be conducting a current. Avoid overloading power strips and other receptacles with multiple plugs. Using only two plugs per outlet lessens the risk of shock and fire. Utilize three-prong plugs whenever possible. The third prong, which grounds the electrical current, should never be removed. Never assume that someone else turned off the power source. Always check for yourself!"

This will prevent any accidental shocks from occurring. Never use an electrical appliance while in the bath or shower. If your toaster or another electric appliance is near your kitchen sink, never use the running water and the appliance at the same time. Keep it unplugged when not in use. Store outdoor electrical equipment in a place where it will be kept dry, like a garage shelf. If a plugged-in appliance falls into water, do not attempt to retrieve it until you turn off power to the corresponding circuit. Once the power is off, you may retrieve the device. Once it is dry, it can be evaluated by an electrician to see if it is suitable for future use."

Make sure that the appliance is set to the appropriate voltage input, and use a 100-240V to 110V or 220V transformer to avoid mistakes caused by accidentally plugging in appliances into the wrong voltage. Understand that the key difference between an adapter and a transformer is that an adapter just allows the appliance to be plugged in, but a transformer steps the voltage to the correct voltage. For chargers, an adapter is fine, but for laundry machines, kitchen appliances, hairdryers, and other appliances without a built-in transformer, use a transformer."

Also, if something does go wrong and you do get shocked, this second person can immediately get you the help you need. Make sure you communicate well with this other person. Many electrical accidents occur because of miscommunication. You need to be able to trust that when this person says the power is off, it is actually off. Even if you trust this other person with your life, it is probably a good idea to double check and make sure the power is off for yourself. Never assume anything when dealing with electricity."
