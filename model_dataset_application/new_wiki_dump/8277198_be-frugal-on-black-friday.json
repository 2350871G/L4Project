          "description":"Before you pull on your scarf and mittens and prepare to wait in line for hours first thing in the morning, have a clear idea of what you\u2019re shopping for and whether it\u2019s worth it. If you\u2019ve already got a Christmas list for reference and you\u2019re trying to check off items at bargain prices, Black Friday sales may save you a substantial amount of money. If you\u2019re simply intoxicated by the idea of discounted goods, however, or you\u2019re just shopping to see what\u2019s out there, you may end up parting with more money than you planned to. Black Friday sales are most favorable to shoppers when they can identify a few things they need, that they can score for significantly less, and only buy these items. If there\u2019s nothing you absolutely have to have, and you\u2019re feeling tempted to shop purely for its own sake, you may be better off finding something else to do with your time."

          "headline":"Preview Black Friday deals.",
          "description":"Traditionally, Black Friday sales ads have run in the newspaper on Thanksgiving day. Nowadays, though, it may be possible to take a look at upcoming specials through store websites or even smartphone apps a few days in advance. Browse through early listings to see how things are being priced, and whether a particular store has what you\u2019re looking for on sale. Being able to look at products and prices in advance will help you calculate a realistic shopping budget, another must for saving during the Black Friday frenzy. Go through reputable channels (such as official sites like Macy\u2019s and Brookstone, or bargain shopping apps like Flipp and Slice) to guarantee that the sales you find are legit."

          "description":"If you\u2019ve scanned through previews of Black Friday sales and something has caught your eye, take a scouting trip to the store that\u2019s selling it and give it a closer look. This way, you\u2019ll be able to inspect the product for quality and see if it suits your budget and personal tastes before committing yourself to buying it. Some basic recon will also familiarize with where to find the item before the store is overrun with swarming crowds. Browsing before doing the bulk of your shopping can provide an opportunity to learn about exclusive in-store deals. Devise a \u201cbattle plan\u201d by plotting your path through a store that you expect to be busy."

          "headline":"Limit yourself to a handful of stores.",
          "description":"Instead of just darting aimlessly from one sale to another, come up with a few stores in particular to visit. In the interest of time and expense, try to keep this number around five or six at most. Settle on stores that stock a wide range of items to get as much done in as few locations as you can, or stores that provide specialty products you can\u2019t get anywhere else. If possible, have a shopping buddy to go deal-hunting with. The two of you can split up and cover more ground, getting to hot items faster and eliminating the need to trek all over town."

You\u2019ll be much more careful about comparing prices and making necessary compromises if you know you can\u2019t exceed a strict total. Having a fixed budget in mind might also force you to get more creative about picking out gifts, which means you could end up with more items than you originally expected for the same amount. Make sure your primary finances are in order before you set aside money for shopping. Be conservative. It\u2019s always better to spend less now and not have to worry about financial security later on."

For instance, if your daughter has asked for a new winter coat, and you want to get your best friend a toaster as a housewarming gift, pick these items out first. After your main shopping is done, you can start browsing freely if you have some spending money leftover. If you\u2019re not shopping for anything in particular, think of what you could personally use in your wardrobe or around the house. Write down the price beside each item on your list and make sure it corresponds with your budget."

You can find some remarkable bargains on Black Friday, but you might be able to track down an even better one somewhere else. Pore over newspaper ads, mailer promotions, store websites and shopping apps to find out who is offering what for how much. That way, you\u2019ll know exactly where to go once it\u2019s time to get shopping. For the sake of business, most stores are willing to match low prices with competitors, saving you money and the need for an extra trip uptown. Pay attention to less obvious stores that might be offering deals on the same products. For instance, you can find a variety of name-brand goods at drugstores, which are likely to be less crowded than mall shops and more popular destinations."

          "description":"Check the mail around Thanksgiving and sign up for store newsletters for a chance to receive coupons that could save you even more on Black Friday purchases. Coupons are an often overlooked way to be thrifty, and, when combined with slashed rates on promotional items, can help keep a little bit of extra money in your pocket. Tuck some coupons in your wallet or checkbook before you head out for your first stop of the day. To prevent overspending, only use coupons for the limited number of stores you decided on ahead of time. In addition to coupons, there are websites where you can go to buy discounted gift cards that will allow you to save a few more bucks on Black Friday purchases."
