  "text":" Loosening the Bottle Cap Use hot water. Hot water has been known to loosen various styles of lids. Be careful when heating and applying hot water to your lid. Use a towel if the cap is too hot to grip. Do not make the water too hot and run it over the cap for too long. This could potentially melt the cap or damage the bottle. Bang the cap. Firmly hold the bottle of water in your hand and hit the cap against a hard surface. You can hit the cap pretty hard and you shouldn't have to worry about the bottle exploding. On cheaper bottles, it can explode easier. Ask a friend. See if your friend or neighbor can loosen the cap for you. It could hurt your pride, but if they can open the bottle, it should be worth it. Breaking the Seal Locate the seal. The seal of the bottle cap should be located at the very bottom of the plastic cap. The seal is a perforated line. Find a sharp object. Scissors will probably be the easiest and safest, but you could also use a steak knife. Be careful when handling sharp blades. Begin sawing the seal. Start a sawing motion, back and forth, with the blade along the seal. Continue until you've broke the seal. Try using your hands. After a portion of the seal has been broken, it should be easier to use your hands. Twist the cap firmly in a counter-clockwise direction. Saw the rest of the seal. If you were unable to twist the seal off using your hands, continue sawing the seal with a blade. Finish by sawing the entirety of the seal before using your hands again. Remove the cap. Once the seal is fully cut, you should be able to open the bottle with ease. Opening with a Rubber Band Locate a rubber band. You might have one lying around the house, but if not, purchase a pack at your local convenient store. Apply a rubber band around the cap. Begin to secure the cap with the rubber band. The rubber band will act as an extra grip. Wrap it around a few times. Be sure the rubber band is fully wrapped around the cap and is tight. The rubber band's lengths should be equally spaced. Twist counterclockwise. Apply all your pressure into breaking the seal. It should crack once this is finished. Remove the cap. Once the seal is broken, you should be able to remove the bottle's cap with ease. Now enjoy the water. Using the Traditional Approach Get a bottle of water. It doesn't matter what brand, just use whatever is easiest for you. Position the bottle. Grip the bottom part of the bottled water with your left hand, or right hand if you are left-handed. Hold it tight. Grip the cap with your other hand. Hold this tight as well. If the ridges on the cap are too sharp, use your shirt as a buffer between your hand and cap.but only some shirts will work Twist the cap counter-clockwise. Use your strength to twist until the cap becomes loose. Make sure you are holding the bottle tightly so only the cap twists, not the bottle. Careful what angle you position your bottle. You don't want to be mopping up the water. Unscrew the cap. Once you break the cap's seal, use your fingers to lightly unscrew the lid. Enjoy the water. You now have an opened bottle of water.",
