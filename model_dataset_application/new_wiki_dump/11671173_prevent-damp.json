          "description":"Condensation occurs when warm air touches cold surfaces, so try to keep your home around the same temperature as much as you can. Keep your bedroom 61\u00b0F to 68\u00b0F (16\u00b0C to 20\u00b0C) and the rest of the house 66\u00b0F to 72\u00b0F (19\u00b0C to 22\u00b0C). When you're not home, make sure the temperature stays above 59\u00b0F (15\u00b0C). For example, don't alter your thermostat to be extremely cold during the day and hot at night or vice versa."

          "headline":"Use a dehumidifier in your kitchen, bathroom, or basement.",
          "description":"Dehumidifiers take moisture out of the air, so it\u2019s best to place them in areas that collect the most moisture. The capacity of the dehumidifier you\u2019ll need depends on the size of the room and how much moisture is in the space. For instance, a 30-pint dehumidifier will work for a slightly damp (50% to 70% humidity) room about 300 square feet (28 square meters) in size. For a moderately damp (60% to 70%) area of 1,500 square feet (139 square meters), a 70-pint dehumidifier is a good choice."

          "description":"Use a dry rag to wipe window sills, window panes, and countertops where moisture might form and settle. Moisture is more likely to show up near your windows in the winter when it\u2019s warm inside and chilly outside. If you have double or triple-paned windows and notice fog or moisture between the panes, it\u2019s a sign that your windows need to be replaced."

Wet surfaces dry slower when it's chilly outside, which can end up creating excess moisture. Save painting and cleaning for days when you can comfortably open a window to prevent trapping air and causing condensation."

Dig a small trench at least 6 inches (15 cm) deep to prevent moisture buildup. Moisture travels from the soil through porous materials (like concrete slab) through a process called capillary suction."

The extra space will allow air to flow between the furniture and the wall, preventing trapped air from causing condensation.

For bathrooms, it's usually located in the ceiling above or near the shower and you use a light switch to turn it on. Be sure to clean your inside extractor vents by wiping them with a rag dipped in soapy water. Closing the door to the kitchen or bathroom will also keep moisture from spreading to other rooms in the house."

It\u2019s okay if you can\u2019t vent on opposite sides, just open 1 or 2 windows or doors to allow moist air to escape. However, if you live in a hot, humid environment, it\u2019s best to rely on the air conditioner and a dehumidifier. As an alternative, leave your ceiling fans running during the day or at night while you\u2019re sleeping."

If the recipe calls for leaving the lid off, be sure to turn on the exhaust fan or, if you don\u2019t have one, a ceiling fan or small electric fan will do the trick. Cracking a window will also help keep the moisture level down when you\u2019re cooking."
