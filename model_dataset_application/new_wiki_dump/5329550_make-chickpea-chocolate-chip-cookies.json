Because everything you need will be in one place, you don't need to waste time rummaging through cupboards. Open the can of chickpeas and dump them into your colander or strainer. Rinse them well and place them into the food processor. Portion out the salt carefully, baking soda, and vanilla extract. Do this using your measuring spoons. Then, add the ingredients to the food processor. Grab your measuring cups and use the correct cups to measure out your peanut butter, milk, oats and brown sugar.
