  "text":" The Technique of Sweating Vegetables Place your cut vegetables, herbs and seasonings and your fat in a cold frying pan. They should not be more than a 1/4\u201d (.6cm) deep in the pan. The best pan for sweating vegetables is a stainless steel skillet with deep sides and a glass cover for observing the sweating process. Put the pan on the stove and turn the heat to low.  Cover the pan. You want to keep the moisture and flavors released by the heat in the pan. Using a spatula or a large spoon, stir the vegetables frequently as they cook.  Listen for a sizzle. The vegetables should not fry and you should not hear a sizzle. If the pan sizzles, turn down the heat or remove the cover. Check your vegetables when you stir them if you do not use a glass cover. They should not brown or turn golden. Turn down the heat if you notice browning. Add a teaspoon of extra fat to the pan if the vegetables stick to the pan.  Cook the vegetables until they are very soft and translucent. The time will vary with the type of vegetables and their size; the smaller the vegetable pieces, the quicker they will soften. Preparing Aromatic Vegetables for Sweating Wash all of the ingredients carefully.  Peel carrots, onions, garlic and any other vegetable that is normally peeled before cooking.  Dice, chop or otherwise cut your vegetables into the size/shape specified in your recipe. Usually a recipe will describe what size the pieces of vegetables should be before they are sweated. If not, use these guidelines. If the aromatic vegetables will be used to make a sauce or will be strained or mashed, the pieces should be small, about 1/4\u201d (.6 cm) in size. If the vegetables will be used in a stew or a dish that will cook for a long time, the pieces should be larger: 1/2\u201d to 3/4\u201d (1.3 to 1.9 cm) in size. Cut tomatoes in half, then scrape out the seeds and \u201cgel\u201d and discard them before dicing tomatoes. Remove the seeds and the white membrane from peppers before dicing them. Smash or finely mince garlic cloves before adding them to the rest of your aromatic vegetables. Mince parsley and any other leafy greens called for in your recipe.  Read the recipe regarding the preparation of ginger if it is used to season sweated vegetables. It may call for grated, minced or powdered ginger. Consult the recipe for the amount of vegetables to sweat. Generally, you don't lose much volume during the sweating process; if a recipe calls for 2 cups of sweated vegetables; start with about 2\u00bd cups of fresh vegetables. If the recipe gives you actual amounts of vegetables to sweat, use those amounts. Aromatic Vegetable Combinations Make mirepoix by sweating a ratio of 2 parts onions, 1 part celery and 1 part carrots. A whole bay leaf is usually added as well. Use butter as the fat. Make soffritto by sweating equal parts of onions and garlic with a little chopped fennel added in. Soffritto recipes often include small amounts of prosciutto, a type of ham. Use olive oil as the fat. Make sofrito by sweating 2 parts onion to 1 part tomato. Use olive oil as the fat. Make refogado using onion, peppers, and tomatoes, in equal parts with a small amount of garlic added for. Small amounts of fresh basil and/ or oregano are sometimes added. Use olive oil as the fat. Make duxelles using equal amounts of diced mushrooms and onions. Many types of mushrooms can be used. Use butter as the fat.
