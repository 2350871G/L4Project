If you\u2019re interested in government-owned vehicles in particular, look at the websites of local or national agencies for relevant information. If you\u2019re interested in cars owned by the U.S. government, search for auctions near you on the GSA\u2019s auto auction website: https://www.usa.gov/auctions-and-sales. You can start to search for state government surplus auctions at this website: https://www.usa.gov/state-surplus-sales\n\nPolice departments also routinely auction off surplus vehicles, so you may want to look at their websites."

The information government auctions provide about the vehicles up for sale is generally much more reliable and comprehensive than what you\u2019ll see at any public auction. At a government auction, you\u2019ll have access to the maintenance and repair histories of vehicles.

Unlike government auctions, most public auctions aren\u2019t transparent about the histories of the cars being sold. For this reason, you should assume that any car you find at a public auction will require fixing. Avoid cars that are sold as \u2018Miles Exempt.\u2019 This term means that the auction does not guarantee the accuracy of the mileage displayed on the car\u2019s odometer. You won\u2019t be able to test drive a vehicle before bidding on it, so take care before making a final decision."
