          "description":"Baseball bats are traditionally made from ash wood. Other common choices include maple and birch. Ash is a strong lightweight wood that provides both strength and flexibility. Maple is a more dense, heavier wood that is great for power hitters. Birch provides heavier weight like maple while still allowing for some flexibility like ash."

Find a lumber yard to get custom cuts of wood, or visit a home improvement store to see what they carry. You can also order blanks online ready to be turned into a bat. If starting with a square piece of wood, use a chisel to remove the corners of your blank. Cut a small amount from the four long edges of the blank to create an octagonal shape. Removing the corners will cut down on the amount of wood you need to remove with the lathe and make it easier to craft your bat."
