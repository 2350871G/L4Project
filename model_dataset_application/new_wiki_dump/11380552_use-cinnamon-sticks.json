Fold the cinnamon sticks into a triangle shape, then pull the cord tight to secure the shape. Tie the loose ends together at the top. To hang the ornament, cut another piece of leather cord about 4 inches (10 cm). Loop it around the top of the triangle and tie it in a knot to secure. You can also use a piece of twine or hemp instead of a leather cord. For more of a holiday vibe, use craft glue to glue a 1 inch (2.5 cm) piece of tree garland onto the bottom corner of the triangle cinnamon ornament."
