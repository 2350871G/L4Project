      "headline":"Choose your color themes.",
      "description":"Choose two colors - one a little more neutral, and one bright one. Blair's color theme is hot pink and rainbow, which are both bright. If you enjoy a lot of bright color, go for it. If you prefer to be more subtle, go with the recommendation; one light/neutral color, and one bright one. Such as a light blue and hot pink or baby pink and neon green... the possibilities are endless. Also be sure you have your furniture color theme picked out. Blair's furniture is all antique-looking wood, but you can pick anything, from white, to chrome... etc."

      "description":"Will you need to repaint anything? This could include furniture, walls, lamps, etc. Do you need more lighting? Put that down on your list. Do you need a place to store jewelry, makeup, books, school stuff and the likes? Or perhaps just a new bedspread? Good places to go for bedroom furniture and accessories are Pier 1 Imports, Target, occasionally Walmart and IKEA. Also whatever local stores you have."
