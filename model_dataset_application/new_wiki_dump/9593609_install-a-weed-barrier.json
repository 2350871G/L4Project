          "description":"You can use a wide variety of mulches in your garden. Straw, shredded leaves, and compost are great options. You can also use wood chips or peat moss. Many organic materials can be used for mulch. It's really up to you what you use. For instance, straw and shredded leaves might be good in areas where you're walking, while compost near plants will provide added nutrients.

Steve Masley\t\t\tOrganic Vegetable Gardener\t\t\t\tMulch will also preserve water for your plants! The team at Grow it Organically say mulch is essential to helping your plants retain water. They say, \"Putting a layer of fine compost around the plants reduces your water loss by about 20-30%. It also cools the soil, so the plants don't dry out as fast and they don't get as stressed out.\""

Therefore, you need to apply it in a nice, even layer that's not too thick and not too thin. It's easiest to bring a wheelbarrow of mulch over to the area.
