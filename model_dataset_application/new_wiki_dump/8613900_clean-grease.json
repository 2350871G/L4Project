If you\u2019re cleaning a spill on a fabric or wood, make sure to blot very gently. The goal is to remove as much grease as possible without making the grease penetrate the material. If you\u2019re cleaning fabric or a carpet, you may consider getting a spoon, a coated piece of cardboard, or something similar and using it to collect as much grease as you can."
