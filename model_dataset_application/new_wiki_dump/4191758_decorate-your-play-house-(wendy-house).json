  "text":" Shell decoration Choose a thick piece of string. Thread all different sized shells from the beach onto the string. To do this, pierce small holes in the shells, then pull the string through and knot the string at either side of each shell. Leave a gap between each shell added, for best effect. The shells can be painted if wished. Or, add glitter or stickers. Get a pin, and hammer it in to the wall of the Wendy house.  Tie a loop in the string. Hang the decoration on the pin. If wished, add another pin and string it across like a garland rather than simply dangling down. If you need extra holding power, tape some masking tape around the string so that it is secured against the wood wall. Decoupage Grab a magazine or two. Start cutting out your favourite things from the magazine. For example, cut out fancy dresses, kittens or puppies, love hearts, food or makeup. Cut out as many as needed to cover the cardboard. Arrange the cut-outs on a large piece of cardboard. Check that the cardboard will fit in a certain spot inside the Wendy house before proceeding. Glue or tape the cut-outs across the cardboard. Completely cover it, then allow to dry (if using glue). Paint sealant such as Mod Podge over the top. Allow to dry. Tape the decoupage poster to a wall of the Wendy house. Repeat as many times as you'd like if you want to cover a lot of the inside walls. Pebble art Grab some pebbles suitable for painting on. Clean them if you brought them in from outside. Cover a table with newspaper. This will protect it from paint. Arrange paints in any colours you like on the table. Start painting the pebbles. Choose designs such as ladybirds (ladybugs), strawberries, faces, animals, etc. Patterns and shapes are a good choice too. Allow to dry. Paint with a sealant such as varnish or Mod Podge to fix the paintwork. Add to the Wendy house. Arrange on windowsills, in baskets or jars, and anywhere else you'd like them to be.",
