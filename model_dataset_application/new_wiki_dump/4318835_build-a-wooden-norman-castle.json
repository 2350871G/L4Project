  "text":" Building the walls Start with the four side vertical posts. Glue the vertical posts in place on the board. To work out where they should be placed, slide in the horizontal base posts and at each end of these, place the vertical posts, one at each corner. Allow to glue firmly in place before proceeding. Then, lay down the horizontal posts between each post and glue firmly in place. Build the walls. Glue the 4-inch wood pieces in a piled fashion on top of the base horizontal posts. Do this for each side of the castle. Glue firmly in place. Leave a gap for the drawbridge as you build. Leave a hole on side, of the height and width of your choice, for the entrance to the castle. Shortly you'll add a drawbridge to this, so it helps to use the size of the drawbridge planks to help you to determine the width and height of this gap. Review your castle so far. Once you have piled and glued the castle together, your castle should look like the one shown in this image. Decorating the castle and surrounds Paint the castle with a grey paint. This can be acrylic paint or poster paint with PVA glue. Paint grass on the plywood base. Leave a 3-inch (7.5cm) gap between the castle wall and the grass; this will be for the moat around the castle. Divide the castle walls with bricks. Use a black marker, black felt-tip pen or black paint and a fine paintbrush to draw lines vertically and horizontally to form bricks. This step is optional; if you find it too difficult, draw a few indicator bricks on just the edges, to give the overall impression of brickwork. Paint the moat.  Design the drawbridge. You can use craft sticks, matchsticks, or similar for making a drawbridge from. Use cross sticks to hold it all together and ensure that it fits the width of the gap that you've left. Cut some wool and plait it to make it into a rope. You'll need two ropes for each side of the drawbridge. Attach the rope pieces to the bridge first, then to the wood.
