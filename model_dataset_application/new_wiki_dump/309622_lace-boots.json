Ask a sales clerk for advice or read the packaging to determine the right boot lace length. If you are getting new laces, measure the laces that came with your boots. The right length depends on a number of factors, including how many eyelet pairs the boot has, the amount of vertical and horizontal spacing between the eyelets, and your desired lacing method. On average, though, you'll need 45 inches (114 cm) for 5-6 eyelet pairs, 54 inches (137 cm) for 6-7 eyelet pairs, 63 inches (160 cm) for 7-8 eyelet pairs, 72 inches (183 cm) for 8-9 eyelet pairs, and 96 inches (244 cm) or more for 10+ eyelet pairs."
