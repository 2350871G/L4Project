          "description":"Almost any type of compact table or desk can be appropriated for this purpose, so explore several different options and go with one that looks the most natural in the space you\u2019re decorating. It\u2019s also worth putting some thought into any additional features you might want, like drawers, cabinets, or built-in lighting elements. The table you choose should be low enough to avoid looking out of place for it\u2019s intended use, but high enough to sit at comfortably. Extra storage space can be a major plus if you have a habit of stockpiling cosmetics or prefer to keep all of your beauty supplies in one place."

          "headline":"Include your table in a unifying color scheme.",
          "description":"Color is another important consideration when narrowing down your choices. To determine which style would look best in a given space, it's important to first take stock of what's already there. If possible, you'll want to find a table you can tie in with your walls, flooring, and surrounding furniture to create a seamless transition for the eye. A vibrant patterned table will make a bold statement in a muted setting, for instance, while neutral tones like black, white, gray, and natural wood finishes have the advantage of going with the greatest number of accessories."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Substitute a cozy seating solution.",
          "description":"Forget the short, knobby powder room stools you\u2019re used to hunching over. Pull up a cushioned bench or chic high-backed chair and take a load off while you put your face on. One of these perches can make your dressing area much more comfortable, especially if you tend to spend a lot of time there. Bring in a chair with adjustable height settings if you\u2019re having trouble finding one that\u2019s the right height for your table. Chairs that roll or swivel can increase your mobility and lend a commanding air to vanities that double as letter desks."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Get creative with your main mirror.",
          "description":"If your dressing table is going to be primarily a decorative fixture, look at a variety of styles to find a replacement that matches the sensibilities you\u2019re expressing. You could also trade in a large central mirror for several smaller ones to establish a busier look, or install an elaborate folding mirror that lets you view yourself from different angles. For a centerpiece that's truly one-of-a-kind, play around with mirrors fashioned from other objects, like a repurposed painting, oversized clock, or vintage window frame. If you're the crafty type, you could even try putting together one of your own. Keep in mind that the mirror you settle on should be the right shape and dimension to give you a good look at yourself from where you\u2019ll be sitting."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Utilize multiple lamps for consistent lighting.",
          "description":"Rather than relying on a single light shining off to the side, position one at either end of your vanity and switch them both on while you\u2019re putting on your makeup. Twin light sources provide illumination from both sides, which can keep you from ending up with uneven eye shadow or the wrong shade of foundation. Soft white bulbs tend to provide the best conditions for applying makeup. Fit your lamps with adjustable shades to cut down on glare. Overly intense lighting can also throw off your brush hand. A soft desk lamp centered above the table will also give off a modest yet revealing glow."

          "description":"Your vanity isn't just another piece of furniture\u2014it's an extension of your bedroom. Research different design styles to identify one that would look at home in your living space. You can then base your secondary accessories on your style of choice. Sticking with a distinct set of characteristics can help you focus your vision and avoid inconsistencies. There are dozens of different interior design styles that provide inspiration for your dressing table, from contemporary minimalism to art decor to French rustic. Avoid mixing and matching your decorations indiscriminately. A classic Victorian-style vanity will stick out like a sore thumb in a mid-century modern bedroom."

          "description":"Place a few framed pictures of your loved ones along the rear edge of the table where you can glance at them while you\u2019re getting ready. Since your dressing table is one of the main focal points of the bedroom, it makes a great place to show off your spouse, children, or pets. Be sure to situate framed photos someplace where they won\u2019t accidentally be knocked over and broken."

          "headline":"Add a flower arrangement or potted plant.",
          "description":"Plants can offer an infusion of color and create an appealing natural contrast to all the man-made objects on your tabletop. An assortment of festive succulents or spray of fresh daylilies may be just the thing you need to tie the various components together. If you desire even more greenery, make room beside your table for a full-figured specimen, such as a towering ficus or cascading fern. As an added bonus, fresh flowers will fill your dressing area with a delightful fragrance, making it smell as beautiful as you look."

          "headline":"Accessorize with chic antiques.",
          "description":"If you\u2019re on the hunt for something eye-catching and out of the ordinary, think throwback. Scour antique malls, flea markets, yard sales, and specialty boutiques to unearth fascinating finds. A clamshell compact, ivory comb, or embossed powder box can complete a vintage-themed vanity and make it feel like a piece of living history. Antiques make an alluring addition to vanities that are mostly meant to be admired from a distance. One of your own cherished family heirlooms could also serve as a unique and meaningful conversation starter."

          "headline":"Surround yourself with stunning artwork.",
          "description":"Hang up paintings from your favorite artists of past and present to cover bare walls and breathe new life into a stale bedroom. Those who prefer a more contemporary atmosphere might shop around for quaint wall hangings, woven tapestries, or spunky pop art offerings. Classical reproductions like Jacques-Louis David\u2019s \u201cPortrait of Madame Recamier\u201d or Boticelli\u2019s \u201cBirth of Venus\u201d can serve as a source of inspiration for your daily beauty rituals. Wall art is especially useful for filling in blank space around corners and alcoves."

Configure the items in your organizer by tone, or group like products together to streamline your morning routine. Hiding the organizer in a drawer may help reduce clutter, though many are unassuming enough to be left out in plain sight. Some organizers are designed with flair in mind as well as functionality. Keep your overarching theme in mind when picking out one of these decorative storage aids to make sure it's a good match for the rest of your decor."

          "description":"Invest in a set of sleek holders to highlight your collection of bracelets, necklaces, and rings. Not only will this spare them the fate of being lost in a drawer somewhere, it will also keep them together for comparison when you\u2019re deciding on a piece to pair with the evening\u2019s outfit. Choose holders and similar displays that are in keeping with the style you\u2019ve chosen for your dressing area. Minimalistic holders in bold colors and abstract shapes will seem to rise right out of a sleek, modern desk, for instance, while a hand-carved wooden rack will look right at home on a rustic mahogany table. Jewelry can make a dazzling decorative touch on its own, even if you rarely get a chance to wear it."

Do the same for your hair dryer, curling iron, laptop, speakers, and any other appliances you need to have close at hand. They\u2019ll stay powered up and you\u2019ll eliminate the need to make a million trips back and forth. If open outlets are few and far between, a hidden power strip will make it possible to hook up more devices at once while also economizing the space you have available. Snap a selfie at your dressing table when you\u2019re done fixing yourself up to check out your handiwork!"

          "description":"Deep trays with raised edges will work best, since they\u2019ll ensure that everything remains upright. Arrange the bottles from biggest to smallest, or order them into neat sections according to their purpose. Feeling and smelling irresistible will then be as simple as working your way down the line. If you\u2019ve got too many products to fit into a single tray, go through and throw out anything you don\u2019t use to determine which ones make the cut. For a more picturesque presentation, transfer your liquid beauty products to ornate glass containers. Don\u2019t forget to label or color-coordinate the containers so you\u2019ll know what\u2019s in them."

Clear some space near the center of the table where you'll have no problem focusing on your finer features. You can move your mirror around as needed to make room for other supplies. Look for makeup mirrors in shapes, sizes, and frame materials that complement your other furnishings. Many makeup mirrors also include convenient built-in lighting elements, eliminating the need to tilt your face at impossible angles or rely on a harsh overhead fixture."
