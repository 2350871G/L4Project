Your going to want the patches to be able to open the trial maps in SparkEdit, to use them, download ppf-o-matic and patch 'sparkify' onto 'bloodgulch.map'. when you're done modding it, just patch the 'undo sparkify' onto the map! then you done. find the patches here: http://files.halomods.com/viewtopic.php?p=488965&sid=66bd23de4af75c1e827a4dd160df3eec Set-Up to Mod Install WinRar to program files.  Navigate to where you downloaded HMT.  Right-click on the HMT icon.  Scroll down to Extract to HMT folder and enter it.  Click the icon that has a music symbol: Halo Mapping Tools.  Hit File on the top left.  Click Open.  Navigate to your Halo maps folder.  Open the map you want to mod. For this tutorial we will be using Bloodgulch. Change pistol to sniper Open the map you want to mod according to the instructions above. The box on the left holds everything in the map. There is also a scroll box to the right of the this window. Scroll down to the bottom, you should see a line that says [Weap] Weapons (20 Items)  Double-click on this, and 20 lines of text should expand.  Find the text that says weapons/pistol/pistol.  Click the text once and see the screen change to list the available plugins.  Download some plug-ins into this utility section; extract them to your hmt plug-in folder.  Look for text that says something like: Zoom levels 1 Minimum Zoom 2 Maximum Zoom 2 Change the text to look like this: Zoom levels 2 Minimum Zoom 2 Maximum Zoom 8 What this does is increases the zoom level of the weapon; we just gave the pistol the zoom level of the sniper.  Projectile Swapping Scroll up until you find a line of text that says, [proj] Projectile (21 items).  Double click on this and scroll down until you see a line of text that says, Weapons/shotgun/pellet.  Click once on this text.  Go to the top of the screen where you should see some text and drop-down boxes, under text that says, Tag Editor.  Click the button that says Swap. It will open up a window at the same place. Scroll down until you find text with a bunch of numbers and letters that says Vehicles/scorpion/tank shell.  Double-click on this text, and return back to the projectile box.  Hit the button that says Save and you have made your first mod. You will probably want to wait until you get more experienced with modding to post a mod as these mods are easy for the more experienced so your mod will be looked down on, and probably flamed. Make a pistol to shoot Master Chiefs Open Blood Gulch with HMT.  Near the top you will see text that says [bipd] bidped (2 items).  Double-click text.  Select the text that says characters/cyborg/cyborg.  At the top of the screen, under tag information, there will be a box that has these letters/numbers in it: B7F240.  Copy this text.  Click on [proj] Projectiles (21 items).  Scroll down to weapons\\pistol\\bullet and click.  Paste the numbers and letters you copied from the Master Chief biped into the box.  Click the Save button and play Blood Gulch.  Verify your pistol shoots Master Chiefs. This mod technique can be applied for a lot of things, the next mod we will make is a good example. Change the game type You may have wondered before how to get new game modes: Team Slayer, King of the Hill, Juggernaut. Here's how:\n\nClose all other windows by My Computer. Open My Computer if it is not already open. Start the Halo Trial as usual. Go to Multiplayer and create a game. See Slayer and CTF on the select a game screen. Click on CTF but do not click OK and do not double-click. Just select CFT. Hold down ALT and hit the Tab key. You should see My Computer again. Go to My Documents. Double-click My Games. Double-click Halo Trial. Double-click Saved. Double-click playlists. Double-click default_playlists. Go down to the folder that reads 32. Double-click that and you should see some weird file called blam.lst. Copy that by right-clicking and selecting Copy. Open My Computer again. Go to Local C: and right-click anywhere in the window. Hit paste to make a back-up copy of CTF. Return to the place where there are those numbered folders 00-37. Double-click Folder 34. Right-click on the blam.lst and select Copy. Return to the numbered folders list. Go to Folder 32 again. Hit paste and when it prompts: \"Do you want to overwrite?\" click OK.\nPress ALT and Tab again. Now you're back at the Halo screen. Hit OK and select the settings and everything for your new game. If you're experienced with a computer just follow these instructions:  Load the game as normal. Click Host an Internet Game. Click on the Blood gulch map and click OK.\nClick on CTF but Do not start the game. Minimize the game. Go to My Documents/My Games/Halo Trial/saved/playlists/default_playlist\n\nCopy the file from one of these folders. The file should be called blam.lst. '00' for Classic Slayer\n'01' for Classic Slayer Pro\n'02' for Classic Elimination\n'03' for Classic Phantom\n'04' for Classic Endurance\n'05' for Classic Rockets\n'06' for Classic Snipers\n'07' for Classic Oddball\n'08' for Classic Reverse Tag\n'09' for Classic Accumulate\n'10' for Classic Juggernaut\n'11' for Classic Stalker\n'12' for Classic King\n'13' for Classic King Pro\n'14' for Classic Crazy King\n'15' for Classic Race\n'16' for Classic Rally\n'17' for Classic CTF\n'18' for Classic Invasion\n'19' for Classic Iron CTF\n'20' for Classic CTF Pro\n'21' for Classic Team Race\n'22' for Classic Team Rally\n'23' for Classic Team Ball\n'24' for Classic Team King\n'25' for Classic Team Slayer\n'26' for Slayer\n'27' for Oddball\n'28' for Juggernaut\n'29' for King\n'30' for Crazy King\n'31' for Race\n'32' for CTF\n'33' for Assault\n'34' for Team Slayer\n'35' for Team Oddball\n'36' for Team King\n'37' for Team Race\n\nPaste the copied file in the folder named '32'. Go back to Halo and click on OK.\nStart the game and enjoy! Note that you will have to close and restart the game while in online mode to switch between more than 2 game types.You do not have to save the blam.lst in another folder. The only difference is that one u close the online game, you will need to shut down the game and then restart the game and it will be back to normal!",
