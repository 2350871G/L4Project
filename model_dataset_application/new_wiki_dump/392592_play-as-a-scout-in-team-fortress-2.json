To do maximum damage with this weapon, you have to be up close to your target. Reload this weapon whenever you're out of combat range, and make sure to think ahead and plan your reloads carefully if you have to do so during battle. This could mean popping behind some cover to do so. The scattergun like the shotgun has a very diverse shot pattern, but this changes from competitive to casual play. The spray of bullets is a consistent pattern with no random crits, as where it is random in casual and with crits."

This weapon does more damage than the Scattergun at long ranges. The Pistol also has a very fast rate of fire. You can use it as a second-hand weapon to the Scattergun. To fire it at maximum speed, you should rapidly click the mouse button instead of holding it down."

You should only use this on an unsuspecting enemy whose back is turned, or when the Scattergun and Pistol are not available for use. This weapon, compared to the other melee weapons in the game, swings faster, but each swing does less damage, so it isn't like the burst damage of the other melee weapons. Beware if your target is also trying to use their melee, as a critical hit from it will kill you instantly if your health is low."
