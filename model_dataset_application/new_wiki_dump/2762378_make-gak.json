Thirty drops per small bottle of glue gives a good color, but you should feel free to add as much food coloring as you\u2019d like. The more drops you add, the deeper your color will be. Try mixing shades to create a new color. Mix blue and red to make purple or mix blue and yellow to make green. You can also try making the mixture with glitter. If you mix too many colors, your mixture will turn an unpleasant shade of brown. You can always make the color darker, but you cannot lighten your color, so it's best to go slowly and add more color later if necessary."
