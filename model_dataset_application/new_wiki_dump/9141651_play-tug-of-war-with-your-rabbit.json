Look for a toy rope that is small enough for your rabbit to handle. You can use toy ropes made for very small dogs, or designed specifically for rabbits. Alternatively, you can make your own by tying knots along a thick strip of felt or terry cloth. Avoid rope toys made of plastic or nylon, as they can be hard on your rabbit\u2019s teeth. Hemp or felt are good options."

Most chew toys for rabbits are long and narrow in shape, making them perfect for tug of war. You can find chew toys for rabbits at your local pet store or online. You can also make your own chew toy for your rabbit at home by repurposing cardboard tubes from toilet paper or paper towels. Always take away any cardboard tubes that have holes or tears in them so the bunny does not swallow any cardboard."

Allow the bunny to play with other toys or on its own. This way, the rabbit\u2019s teeth and mouth are not at risk of injury. Rabbits like to climb and hop around, especially on ramps and soft surfaces like carpet. You can play a game where you encourage the rabbit to climb or hop to a certain spot by tapping on the spot. You can also use a treat to encourage it to climb or hop. You can also use a rubber ball to play with the rabbit. Try rolling the ball to the rabbit. Encourage it to roll the ball back to you by making a rolling motion at the rabbit."
