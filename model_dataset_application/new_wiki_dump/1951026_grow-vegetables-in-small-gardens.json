Build a square foot garden by using untreated lumber. Cut four boards into 4.25 ft (130 cm) lengths. Nail or stake all four ends together to create a square. This will be the outline of your garden. Use strips of wood or string to divide your square foot garden into 16 equal sections. Each section will serve as a separate planting area. To use string, just drive small nails into the rim of the bed at one foot intervals. Then, tie string on each nail so that it runs across the bed. This will make a grid you can use for square foot gardening. Group the same type plant seedlings into one square foot block. For square foot gardening, it\u2019s OK to plant more densely than normally. You could grow one tomato or eggplant per square foot, or 3 to 4 leafy plants per square. Each square within your square foot garden will yield its own vegetable planting."
