          "description":"When you arrive in your new home, make an effort to get to know your neighbors. You might feel strange, or awkward, but even if you don\u2019t become lifelong friends, you will benefit from being on friendly terms. A simple smile and wave will be enough for most people. Stop by your immediate neighbors\u2019 homes to say a quick hello and introduce yourself or your family. You can ask questions about the neighborhood (such as trash pick-up days), and can answer a few questions about yourself and your family. If you feel comfortable, you can host a little party for your neighbors to get to know them, offering them a chance to meet you and get to know a little bit about you in a casual, relaxed setting. Building a group of friends often starts with one person. From there, they can introduce you to their social circle, and help you connect through mutual interests. Your neighbors are a great place to start building that network."

Choose a church or meeting to attend, or choose several and visit a new one each week. See where you fit in and feel comfortable. While some religions have strict rules about which church you can attend, most do not. Look around, visit different churches, and meet with different clergymen to find the right fit for you."

          "description":"Groups run the gamut, from Young Republicans to book clubs. Evaluate your interests and search for a local group of people who enjoy similar hobbies or interests. Social groups often have chapters worldwide. If you are already a member of any type of group, meet with the group\u2019s leader to see if there is a branch in your new community, or a similar organization you can join. Some apps are intended for this exact purpose. Meetup, iGon, Weave, and Majikal are just a few that offer groups, events, and local business opportunities. A word of caution, however: any time you meet strangers, be wary of divulging contact information, and always meet in a public place."

Search to see if your town has a message board or Facebook group, and join in the conversation. Some towns have Facebook groups specifically for selling or buying items, much like Craigslist. Although this might not seem like the ideal way to make friends, selling or searching for certain items could connect you to people in similar lifestyle situations, such as people with young children, or people who love to garden. Visit your city\u2019s website for information about message boards. Many cities will have these groups posted directly to the city\u2019s website."

While not every person you work or go to school with will be an instant connection, make yourself known and familiar around the office or school. If your colleagues are grabbing dinner after work, or having a drink, tag along. This will allow you to socialize without the pressure of getting work done, and will provide a low-key means of getting to know your coworkers. Make use of after-school programs or extracurricular groups to meet more people in a setting they are familiar or comfortable with. If you're not currently in school, you can even consider taking a course at a community college or joining an intramural sports group to meet people with similar interests."

If cleaning out your new home is drastically outside of your comfort zone, find a cleaning service and utilize their skills. You can meet some wonderful people by simply inviting them to perform a service for you. While this may not be a great way to make friends, it is a great way to get an idea of what types of people and activities you have in your new town. You can ask the people you\u2019ve hired what they like to do for fun, where they like to eat, etc. Always treat people helping you with kindness. If they are providing a service, offer a tip. If they are helping for free (such as a neighbor helping you move in), give baked goods or a gift card in exchange."

In volunteering your time, you are giving back to your community, while meeting new people and making acquaintances. When volunteering in a new place, start one volunteering position at a time. Even if you are a volunteer veteran, different cities and organizations place different expectations upon their workers. Volunteer according to your interests. This will help you find people who enjoy similar things, which will increase the likelihood of making lasting connections. If you volunteered with other organizations back home, the organization might have a chapter in your new town. Your previous chapter can send an email or make a call to make introductions. Habitat for Humanity and the Special Olympics are two nonprofits that have branches or offices in numerous towns."

Visit your city offices to find out what new laws or ordinances are being proposed, what types of services your city has to offer, and to discover whether or not your city has pressing needs you can assist with. Although many boards will require an election process, city offices often have volunteer opportunities, and are happy to help people get involved. When visiting your city office, offer your help. You can lead a park clean-up every Saturday morning, or offer a free yoga class during office lunch. The office may not have any available volunteer positions, but either way, you are making yourself known in your new home."

You will likely pay a higher price, but you will meet more locals this way, and can talk to the owners and workers about your new town. Coffee shops are often great places to visit as you work to build community. Striking up a conversation with a stranger over coffee can provide a lot of insight into your home. Libraries are also a great place to meet new people, as well as find community event postings and get recommendations from locals regarding things they love around town. If you find a place you love, show it! Visit regularly, and let your face become familiar to the workers. You can build connections with the workers, or you might find yourself getting along with other regulars."

If your city does not have any events like this organized, offer to help! If you have experience organizing parties or planning community events, offer your services. You might not get paid, but you can certainly get your name out in your new community, and you will come into contact with a lot of new faces."

Check books out from the library, go for a stroll in the park, and enroll in a community class. These are all excellent ways to meet new people and make friends, and they all cost little to nothing--a great option for someone who has just incurred the expense of moving. Most libraries have classes and groups that meet throughout the week. Join a book club, or meet with a \u201cMommy and Me\u201d group to give yourself some more structure to your week, and meet people in your area. Community centers typically have classes that might be offered at gyms and community colleges, but at a fraction of the price. Take advantage of these savings, and learn something new."

Although there is nothing wrong with watching TV, doing nothing else may result in lower self-esteem or a rapid loss of free time. If you must watch TV, try to do something productive during the inactive time, such as cleaning, cooking, or using a new skill such as knitting."
