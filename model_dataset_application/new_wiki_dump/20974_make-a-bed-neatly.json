Bed skirts come in different lengths. Measure from the floor to the top of the box spring to determine what length you need. Choose a bed skirt that matches the color of your sheets or complements the color scheme in your bedroom. For a classic, feminine look, use a ruffled or gathered bed skirt. For a sleek, modern feel, opt for a tailored bed skirt. A bed skirt is also sometimes called a bed ruffle or a valance."

Mattress pads are sold according to the size of your bed. If you have a Queen Size bed, you'll need a queen size mattress pad\nSome mattress pads also provide extra cushioning.

Make sure the elastic edges are tucked all the way under the mattress so that they don\u2019t ride up or come undone. If you have a tall mattress, like one with a pillow-top, a deep fitted sheet will cover the mattress better. Most sheet sets come with a fitted sheet. However, you can also use a flat sheet. Simply tuck it tightly around the mattress. Linen FAQs\nWhat\u2019s the best thread count?Higher isn\u2019t always better, contrary to popular. Stick to a 300 thread count. A lower count won\u2019t be very soft, and a higher count could rip. Do I need to iron my linens?It\u2019s not necessary, but ironing your sheets gives your bed a super crisp, polished look. The only material that shouldn\u2019t be ironed is flannel. How do I make my sheets last longer?Keep at least 2 sets of linens. That way you don\u2019t wear out 1 set by washing it every single week. Is a fitted sheet necessary?No. In fact, many hotels use a flat sheet to wrap around the mattress."

Check that the top edge of the sheet is still aligned with the top edge of the mattress after you make any adjustments. If the sheet is crumpled or has creases from being folded, iron the sheet before setting it on the bed. Put sheets that have a pattern on the bed with the pattern facing down. That way, when you fold it back over the blanket, the pattern will be showing. What Kind of Sheets Are the Best? The softest: Go with 100% Egyptian cotton for a super luxurious bed. You can also look for sheets with a sateen weave, which makes them silkier. The warmest: Cozy up to flannel or jersey sheets during the cooler months. The most kid-friendly: Sheets made with a cotton-polyester blend are durable and can handle a lot of washing. The crispest: Sheets with a percale weave will fold more cleanly."
