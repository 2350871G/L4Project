  "text":" Inverted 'L' Gallows Use a stout piece of lumber, at least 3m long, preferably between 4m and 5m. Make sure that it is at least 20cm (8\") wide, and is fashioned as a square  or rectangle. Attach another piece of lumber of a similar type but 1-2m long to the top of the first piece of lumber to make an 'L' shape.  (Optional) - Attach 4 pieces of lumber to the end of the long piece of lumber opposite to the 1-2m long piece. The 4 pieces can be as long as you want, and attached in the form of a cross, with one on each side of the square diameter of the pole. This is for stability, and can be used as a stand when braces are attached, or as an anchor when buried deep enough. Add a brace to the 'tail' of the 'L' (the 1-2 m long part) at about 45\u00ba to connect to the main pole. This helps brace it and prevent it from breaking. Notch a grove onto 'tail' of the 'L' part, about half a metre from the end. This is where you will loop the noose. Dig a hole deep enough and stand up your gallows. The optional 'cross-bar anchor' while help greatly in providing support for it. Operation - Your victim stands on a stool/chair, and the noose is looped around the neck. When the time is ready, the stool is kicked away. Hanging Frame (full-frame-and-stand-with-trapdoor design) Make the floor out of planks. This floor should be around 3m by 2m for a one person gallows. Make the floor elevated 2-3m by making legs and braces for it, so it resembles a stand or a large table. Add a staircase for convenience, or you can keep it as is and use a ladder every time. The Hanging Frame Take two 3m long posts/poles that are fashioned into square diameters (similar to that as described in the inverted 'L' design) and attach a third pole 2m long across the top of them both. You can add two braces from the center of the third post attaching to the other two posts at a 45\u00ba angle. Cut a notch into the top of the third post for your noose.  Putting them Together Attach the posts to the top of the stand. If you use longer 5m posts, you can run the posts through the floor of the stand to the ground. Make sure that they are still attached though. On the floor of the stand, directly underneath the cut notch, cut out a 1m by 1m square. This will be your trapdoor.",
