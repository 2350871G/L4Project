          "description":"The average cost of a full renovation for a medium-sized bathroom is about $10,000 USD. For a large master bathroom, aim to save about $15,000 USD to cover any additional tile or plumbing you need to complete. When you set your budget, make sure you stick to it closely so you don\u2019t accidentally overspend. The $10,000 estimate is if you plan on replacing your fixtures, tiling, cabinets, and countertops. You may spend more or less depending on the size of your bathroom and the amount of work you do. Try to save an extra 10% of your total budget in case you need to make any emergency repairs. If you\u2019re working on a half-bathroom, plan on saving about $5,000-$7,000 USD."

          "description":"A different paint color or a new vanity might be enough to make your space feel like new. If you already like the layout of your bathroom, consider replacing only one aspect of it to save money and work time. However, if you need to make major adjustments, it will be easier to renovate everything at once so you don\u2019t need to do it again in a few years. Try changing the accessories in your bathroom first to see if that\u2019s all you need. When making a budget for a partial renovation, look for the costs of the components you want to replace and save about 10% more than the cost."

Save pictures you like or bookmark them to look at later. Traditional bathrooms usually feature a full bath and shower combination. Modern bathrooms look sleek and contemporary, but most tend to only have a shower stall instead of a bath.

          "description":"Pick the paint or tile colors you want for your bathroom so you can base the rest of your design around it. Settle on at least 3 colors so you have a primary, secondary, and accent shade. Try using light colors, such as white, cream, or yellow, to make your space feel larger and more inviting. Make sure your decor and accessories match the color scheme for your bathroom, or else you\u2019ll need to buy new decorations.Tip: Follow the 60-30-10 rule when choosing colors for your bathroom. Your primary color for the room should take up 60%, a secondary color should be 30%, and accent colors should cover 10%. For example, you may have white walls and cabinets as your main color, black floors and countertops for your secondary, and blue accessories as your accent."
