Players who take the commando approach don\u2019t stand still for very long and fare better with guns that shoot quickly, reload easily and have a high ammo capacity. If you plan on jumping into the thick of things, grab a gun with a quick rate of fire that can hold a lot of darts, like the Retaliator (Preferably with a drum) or the Rapidstrike ECS-18. If you want to use customizable guns, use the Stryfe or the Modulus ECS-10 blaster \nBe sure to pack a secondary weapon such as the disruptor for when your main gun runs out of ammo.

Defensive players tend to post up in one place and maintain a limited amount of movement within the area. For these folks, weapons that fire in powerful bursts at close range will be ideal. Try the classic Nerf Ballzooka if you want to pack a punch, or the two shot Roughcut and its one shot cousin the Brainsaw. Mounted machine guns and heavy artillery such as the Rhino-Fire (note: this blaster jams often)  with large magazines are ideal for defensive players."

          "description":"If you\u2019re playing in a more open space, you have the option of a \"sniper\". Nerf \"sniper\" rifles do not fire darts from long range or with greater precision than assault-style weapons and pistols. designated modded snipers can be a great asset to securing victory in a Nerf war, especially when you\u2019re playing with large teams. The Longshot CS-6 (especially modified) is generally regarded as Nerf's most well-rounded sniper models, though you might also fare well with the silence and range of a bow and arrow, such as the sleek and minimal MEGA Lightning Bow or the beefier MEGA Thunderbow. Some crossbows such as the Elite Crossbolt are also somewhat more accurate with a high capacity. You can be a sniper for defense too. If you're out of darts, have a magazine/clip refill and if you have a storage stock, store a magazine in it. If your sniper is completely out of ammo, have an accurate pistol or even a silent-strike blow-dart pipe. Some examples of accurate pistols are Falconfire, fire strike and clear shot. Patient players with good aim make the best snipers. When sniping, keep yourself concealed to avoid being forced into a showdown."

Though different Nerf weapons have different functions and characteristics, it\u2019s more about how you play the game. If you\u2019re just in it to have a good time, you can make almost any type of gun work for you. Simpler is better for players who frequently play many different roles. Nerf\u2019s Zombie Strike line makes for good all-around weapons, with average range, decent ammo capacity and simple firing mechanisms."

Heavily-armed defensive or stationary players will be able to make use of heavier guns like the N-Strike Vulcan,Stampede or the Doominator Blaster, whereas player who needs to be mobile and quick on their feet should opt for less bulky weapons like the Elite Retaliator or the Strongarm. Nerf guns can get quite heavy. The N-Strike Stampede ECS, for instance, weighs in at a whopping 5 pounds. This can make them hard to wield effectively if you tend to be quicker on your feet."

Load up on extra Nerf magazines (sold separately) so that you can reload mid-game\nCertain Nerf blasters like the Disruptor and the Hammershot are cylinder loaded, which means it\u2019s easy to scoop darts right up off the ground if you need to quickly reload on the spot."

Long-range weapons like the 3D printed Caliburn, longshot (especially modded) or even a Nerf bow-and-arrow can help you accomplish this feat while putting yourself at medium to low risk. Modded long-range weapons can send darts flying up to 100 feet. If the Nerf blaster is not modified but its range is high then it can reach a maximum of 65 to 100 feet. By using optionally available modding accessories such as stronger springs, the range of every model can be increased up to 65 to 100 feet on the basis of their mod capabilities."

It may just be the thing that pretend-saves your life! Make sure you save a few darts for your sidearm. Many of the more compact Nerf blasters only hold between 1-3 darts.
