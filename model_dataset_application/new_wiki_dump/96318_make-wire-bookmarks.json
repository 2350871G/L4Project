Leave approximately 2 inches (5 cm) unbent and without a design. Hammer the wire design flat. Do this carefully, in small, repeated knocks. Try to make it as flat as possible, as this is the part that will sit inside the book. Bend a loop shape out of the unbent 2 inches (5 cm) of wire that you left while making the design in step 1.  Tassel Take the piece of thin wire. Bend one end of this into a small loop so that the beads can't slide off. String the beads on. Leave about half an inch of wire unbeaded, as this will be the part that you attach to the thick wire of the bookmark. Bend this section of thin wire around the loop that you created on the thick wire of the bookmark. This forms the beaded tassel that dangles off the bookmark. Give as a gift, or enjoy it for yourself.  Finished. ",
