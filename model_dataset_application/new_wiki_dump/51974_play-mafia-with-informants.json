The first person to nominate the person \"on trial\" has to give their reason for nominating him or her. Then the person who seconded the person \"on trial\" has to give their reason. The person that is on trial has the opportunity to give their defense. The defense can be as long as the person wants it to be, and another person may come to another person\u2019s defense. Next it is time to vote to see if the person is killed or not. If the majority wants the person to live, than that person will stay alive, and if the majority wants that person to be voted off, then they are dead for the round. After a person dies, the moderator can tell everyone what the person was in the game. This process will continue until someone is voted off. If a person is voted for and survives, that person is immune to being killed until the next open kill. Someone in each round must be voted off.
