Take a mould of the shape which you would like to provide the cake with. For example, you could use a heart shape mould, a circle mould or a square mold, depending on the person you're giving the paper cake to. Transfer the wet paper mixture to the mould.  Let the mixture dry in sunlight or in air for two to three days. For best results Let it dry for four complete days. Do not take out the mixture from the mould before three days have passed. Making the cake cream Make the cream bag first. Take a health drink packet and cut the bottom edge in the shape of one fourth of a circle. Wrap a rubber band or a thread around to close the bag. Make a small hole at the tip of the bag. Prepare a required quantity of poster or watercolor and some talcum powder to it. Then mix it all together well. Choose the poster color according to the color of the cake, or according to your preference. Transfer the cream mixture to the cream bag. Close the bag with either a rubber band or thread. Press the bag on the cake. Create beautiful patterns on the cake. Let the cream dry for 1-2 days. Done.
