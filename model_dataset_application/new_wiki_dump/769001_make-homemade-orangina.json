Making soda water can be done through fermentation using yeast and sugar (as demonstrated in How to Make Cream Soda), but the most effective, efficient and inexpensive way is through forced carbonation using a rechargeable siphon, as shown in the video below. You can buy these from Amazon, cooking utensil stores such as Williams-Sonoma, eBay vendors and other sources. Be careful of used siphons; see the Warnings below."

Stay away from Chinese-made soda charger cartridges, as they have been known to impart a bad taste to the resulting carbonated water due to the use of low-quality CO2 gas."

If your tap water does not taste good, neither will the resulting soda water; use filtered or bottled water for best results. Use cold water, or cool the siphon in the refrigerator before using. Warm soda water does not taste good!"
