          "description":"Unless your deck is less than a year old, a clear or fully transparent stain or sealer is not recommended. For a natural wood look that still hides knots and grain pattern, choose a semi-transparent stain. To cover the wood completely and hide its natural color and grain patterns, choose a solid stain instead. An oil-based stain or sealer will penetrate the wood deeper and last longer, but a water-based product will be easier to clean. It\u2019s also best to choose a stain that provides:\nA waterproof finish (not just water-resistant) to protect it from the elements. UV-resistance to protect it from the damaging rays of the sun. Protection from water damage (it will contain a mildewcide). Insecticide if your home is prone to wood-eating bugs."

You can either buy large sheets of plastic or cut open plastic garbage bags, but make sure you cover  up nearby plants before you move on to the next stages."
