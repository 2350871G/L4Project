Chop garlic before freezing to make it easier to throw into a dish quickly. Freezing chopped garlic in oil prevents it from freezing solid, which will allow you to scoop only appropriate amounts out when you're ready to use it. Using olive oil can make your garlic last longer than any other oil. Peel the cloves and pur\u00e9e them. Pur\u00e9e with oil in a blender or food processor using 2 parts oil to 1 part garlic. The pur\u00e9ed garlic will stay soft enough in the freezer to scrape out parts to use in saut\u00e9ing. Freeze this mixture immediately\u2014do not store it at room temperature."
