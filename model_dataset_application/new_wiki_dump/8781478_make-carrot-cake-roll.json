Next, line a 10-inch (25-cm) by 15-inch (38-cm) jelly roll pan with parchment paper. Spray the paper with nonstick cooking spray and lightly flour it before setting it aside. If you don\u2019t have parchment paper, you can substitute foil. You can use butter to grease the pan in place of the cooking spray if you prefer."

Once the batter is fully mixed, add 2 cups (100 g) of shredded carrots. Use a rubber spatula to gently fold them into the batter until they are fully incorporated. Baking and Cooling the Carrot Cake Pour the batter into the prepared pan. When you\u2019re finished mixing the carrot cake batter, carefully pour it into the prepared jelly roll pan. Use the rubber spatula to spread it evenly throughout the pan. The batter will be fairly thin, so be sure to spread it to all the corners of the pan.

Sprinkle a kitchen towel with powdered sugar. While the carrot cake is baking, lay out a clean kitchen towel on the countertop.

As soon as the cake is finished baking, immediately turn it out onto the kitchen towel. Start with the short end of the cake and roll it up tightly with the towel.

You want the cake to be room temperature before you add the filling, or the cream cheese frosting may melt out of it. Making the Filling Cream the cream cheese and butter together. To prepare the filling, add 6 ounces (170 g) of softened cream cheese and 4 tablespoons (57 g) of softened, unsalted butter to a medium bowl.

Filling and Rolling Cake Unroll the carrot cake. Once the cake is cooled and the filling is prepared, carefully unroll the cake. Make sure that it lays flat on towel so you can easily spread the filling over it. If you like, you can sprinkle the top of the cake with more powdered sugar before you add the filling. Spread the filling over the cake and reroll it. When the cake is laid out flat, use a butter knife or offset spatula to spread the filling all over the top of it. Next, start at the short end and roll the cake back up tightly with the filling inside. Leave a \u00be-inch (19-mm) border on all sides of the cake when you spread the filling.
