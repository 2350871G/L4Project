          "description":"An easy and efficient way to separate your crystals is by their finishing method. Some crystals have a shiny, smooth outside, and they go through a polishing process to tumble them. Raw crystals refer to stones that are not tumbled and still look as if they came out of the ground. Separate your crystals based on these categories before you place them in your storage solution. In addition, some crystals such as Selenite or Labradorite are really sensitive and can break easily. For instance, you can place all of your tumbled stones in a box and put your raw specimens on a bookshelf."

Make a pile for any red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, clear/white, and black crystals. This way, you can easily pick out a perfect stone to use during your healing session. For example, if you want to feel more grounded and secure, select a piece of garnet to use while you\u2019re meditating. To increase clarity and focus, pick a piece of quartz to keep on your body throughout the day."

You can also arrange your crystals based on size. Put the large crystals toward the back, and place the small ones along the front.

A great way to do this is to arrange some of your crystals along a windowsill 1-3 days before the next full moon cycle. Leave the crystals on the windowsill for 1-3 days after the full moon so they can absorb as much energy as possible. This is a great short-term storage method."
