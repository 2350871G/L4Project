To finish your bead, knit 2 together to the end of the next row.

Casting off is the process of securing the end of the knitting. To start, knit the first 2 stitches. Then, loop the first stitch on the right-hand needle over second stitch. Then knit another stitch and loop the first stitch over the second stitch again. Repeat this to the end of the row to bind off all of your stitches. Cut and tie off the last stitch in the row.

Pull the tail of the yarn through the loop all the way to secure the last stitch in the row. If desired, you can double-knot the last stitch. Sew the ends together with a yarn needle. Thread a needle with the tail end of the yarn. Insert the threaded yarn needle through the first stitch in the row on both ends of your i-cord. Then pull the yarn until it is taut. Repeat this for the rest of the row to secure all of the stitches. You can sew together the ends of pieces for earrings to create knit hoop earrings or leave them straight. Add a clasp if needed for a bracelet or smaller necklace. For a snug-fitting necklace or bracelet, add a closure instead of sewing the strand ends together. Use pliers to open a jump ring, which is a small metal ring used to attach a closure to the end of a necklace. Loop the jump ring around the end of the i-cord, and then attach it to the end of 1 side of the clasp. Use the pliers to close the ring. Repeat this for the other half of the clasp. You can purchase a simple necklace or bracelet closure at a craft supply store, such as an s-hook or lobster clasp. Jump rings are often sold along with closures, but you can also buy them separately. Mount earring pieces onto fishhook bases. Fishhook earring bases have a small metal loop with a tiny opening. Slide the part of the knit earring piece that you want to go on the base over the loop. Do this for both earrings. This will connect them to the earring bases. If you are using a chunky yarn and the opening is too small to slide the yarn over easily, then open the metal loop slightly with a pair of pliers.
