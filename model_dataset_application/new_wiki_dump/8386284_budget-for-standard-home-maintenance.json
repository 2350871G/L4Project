According to this rule, you should budget between 1 and 2 percent of the purchase price of your home for annual maintenance and repairs. If your home is older or you live somewhere with inclement weather, you should budget around 2 percent or higher. For example, if you bought a home that cost $300,000, you should save between $3,000 and $6,000 annually for maintenance. The money that you save using this method should be used to cover the expenses associated with home repair, such as the cost of supplies or contractors."
