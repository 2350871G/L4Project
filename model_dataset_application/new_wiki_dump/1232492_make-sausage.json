It makes sure that the meat is ground up properly, and it also enables you to grind the sausage to the exact specifications dictated by your recipe. More importantly, it saves time. Some standard mixers come with a meat grinder attachment, which works very well for making sausage. Get a grinder with both coarse and fine settings since different recipes call for different meat textures. If you would prefer not to grind your own meat, you can ask the butcher to grind it for you."

          "description":"This is another vital piece of equipment if you plan on making sausage more than once. Stuffing sausage into pork casings greatly improves the taste of your sausage because it allows the flavors to mix and marinate with each other. This doesn't happen as much when the meat isn\u2019t in a casing. You can stuff sausages by hand if you\u2019re an expert stuffer -- which you\u2019re probably not. So, most likely, the results won't be as good. Some meat grinders come with a sausage stuffing apparatus. If you prefer not to buy a sausage stuffer, you can make loose sausage meat by forming it into patties instead."

          "description":"The most common casings are made from salted pork intestines. They are available at many butcher shops as well as online, and they are most commonly sold by the foot. Fifteen feet (4.6 m) of pork casings, for instance, is roughly equivalent to 1 pound. If you prefer not to use the traditional casings made of pork, synthetic casings made from collagen are available as well. You also can use blanched savoy cabbage leaves as casings if you want to avoid using pork."

          "description":"Before you get started, clear out your freezer to make room for the meat, fat, and all of the equipment you'll be using, including the bowls. It's very important to keep everything cold while you're making sausage. If the fat starts to get soft, it won't properly emulsify with the meat. That means when it comes time to cook the sausage, the fat will separate from the meat instead of cooking with it. In other words, the sausage will be ruined. Keeping everything cold prevents this from happening. Freeze the meat and fat solid before you get to work. This way when you\u2019re working, it will still remain cool even as it thaws. Place the equipment in the freezer for a couple of hours before you start making sausage. When you're ready to start, check to make sure everything is cold enough. The ingredients and equipment should be so cold that it's uncomfortable to work with them. If your meat and materials start to warm up during the sausage-making process, periodically put them back in the freezer to cool down. Then, take them out when they\u2019re cool enough to work with again."

Take the meat out of the freezer and run it through the grinder using either a coarse or fine setting, depending on your preference. Some recipes recommend using a specific grinding setting, but many leave it up to individual preference. The coarse setting is similar to a rough chop. It grinds the meat into thick chunks, while the fine setting grinds up the meat finely.

It takes some practice to get the hang of how fast to crank the stuffer and fill the casing. So, go slowly at first since you don't want the casing to rip. If you have sausage meat that won't fit in the stuffer, keep it in an ice cold bowl until you run out of sausage. Then, quickly fill the stuffer again.

If you're making sausage links, place the mixed sausage back in the freezer and prepare the sausage stuffer. Stuffing the Sausage Prepare the sausage stuffing equipment. Take the sausage stuffer out of the freezer, and set it up according to the manufacturer instructions. Run warm water through the sausage casings, and get them ready to stuff by draping one end over the rim of the bowl while the tail continues to soak in warm water.

If you run out of casing, remove it from the stuffer, tie off the end, and resume with a new casing. Keep stuffing casings until you run out of meat. Form the links. You should now have one or more coils of sausage knotted at one end of the casing and open at the other.

Drying and Storing the Sausage Hang the sausage to dry. Use a wooden drying rack or another type of rack to hang the sausages up to dry. Drape them over the rack at every other twist so that the links hang down but don't touch. Let them dry for an hour and a half. Pop the air bubbles. Sterilize a needle by heating it over a flame, and use it to prick each sausage where you see an air bubble. This lets out any air that is trapped inside and flattens the casing against the meat. Store the sausages. Place the sausages in a container in the refrigerator overnight so that the flavors continue to meld. After eight or so hours, the sausages are ready to eat. Cook them within one week, or freeze them for up to several months before eating.",
