          "description":"Very small holes are usually caused by nails or screws and can be repaired easily and quickly with spackle. There are a variety of spackling pastes for sale. It's usually a good idea to get a lightweight spackling paste that uses the new primer technology, so that a crack does not develop at the seam between the wall and the patch. Small cracks between molding and trim can be filled with spackling paste but it is probably easier to use paintable caulk, which is available at any home improvement store. Simply run a bead of caulk along for crack and smooth with a wet finger."
