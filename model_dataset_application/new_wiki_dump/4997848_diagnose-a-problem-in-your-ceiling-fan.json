In this case, you'll need to check the switches in your breaker box. The breaker box has a metal door and can be found in the basement or garage. If you live in an apartment, it might be in a hallway or utility room. If you can, use the wall switch to operate the fan rather than a remote. When the circuit to your fan is tripped, the power to your fan is disconnected. If the fan trips your circuit breaker, other appliances may also not work in your house."

Check to make sure that all of the wires running from the wall are properly connected to the switch. Most ceiling fan switches will have 2-3 wires running from the wall to the switch as well as a metal ground wire that\u2019s not connected to anything, coming out from the wall.

If the circuit regularly trips when you turn the fan on, it could be overloading the circuit and points to a more serious electrical problem. If this is the case, contact an electrician. Checking the Wall Switch Purchase a volt reader or multimeter online or at a hardware store. Voltmeters and multimeters are handheld electrical devices that are able to read the electrical current coming from your switch. If there is no current running through your switch, it means that the wiring or switch is faulty and should be replaced. Voltmeters are typically cheaper than multimeters. Unscrew the plate covering the switch for the fan. Wear a pair of rubber gloves when working with the switch so you don\u2019t accidentally electrocute yourself. Use a Phillip\u2019s head screwdriver to remove the screws in the top and bottom of the plate covering the switch on the wall. Then, slide the plate off to expose the wires inside of the switch. Your switch should have 2-3 wires connected to the wall and a metal \"ground\" wire hanging from the top of the switch. Unscrew the switch from the wall. Use the screwdriver to unscrew the top and bottom screws that hold the switch in place. Remove any electrical tape that might be holding the switch or the wires in place and pull the switch out from the wall so that you can look at its wiring.

Most ceiling fan switches will have 2-3 wires running from the wall to the switch as well as a metal ground wire that\u2019s not connected to anything, coming out from the wall. If the wires are disconnected, you'll have to turn off the power from your breaker box and properly connect the switch to the wires in your wall. Hold one probe against the bottom contact on the side of the switch. Flip the switch to the fan to the off position. Then, turn on your voltmeter or multimeter on and hold one of the probes against the black metal screw, or contact, on the side of the switch. The black metal screw is the power that\u2019s running to the switch. If you\u2019re using a multimeter, remember to set the device to volts. Hold the other probe against the metal wire and read the display. Place the other wire against the metal wire. The display should read around 120V. If it doesn\u2019t read anything, it means that there is no power running to your switch and your switch is faulty or your wiring is damaged. Test the top contact on the switch. Remove the probe from the bottom screw and place it against the top screw. Then, take the other probe on your voltmeter or multimeter and hold it against the ground wire again. The top switch should also read 120V. If you aren\u2019t getting any volts coming into either screw, it could mean that the wiring connected to the switch is faulty. Test the red wire on the other side of the switch if you have one. Hold one probe against the ground wire and the other probe to the contact connected to the red wire on the opposite side of the switch. Again, this should read 120V. If the wires are connected and you\u2019re getting a 0 voltage reading on the switch, contact an electrician to check your wiring.

Diagnosing Motor Problems Turn the fan\u2019s lights on, if it has them. Flip the switch and pull the fan chord that controls the lights to the fan. If the lights turn on but the fan doesn\u2019t work, there is most likely an issue with the fan\u2019s motor.
