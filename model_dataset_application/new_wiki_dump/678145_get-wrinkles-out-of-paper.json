It\u2019s important to be gentle, though, because you may rip the paper if you use too much force. The goal is to flatten it, so it\u2019s as smooth as possible."

          "description":"Your hand may not be able to smooth all of the wrinkles from the paper, but a significant weight can often press out the creases and folds. Look for items around the house that are fairly heavy, such as thick books, pots and pans, or even bricks. Choose objects that are as large or larger than the paper to ensure that the entire surface is covered. You don\u2019t necessarily need one extremely heavy object. Try stacking several smaller objects on top of one another to create a significant weight."

Check that the entire sheet of paper is covered, so all of the wrinkles can be smoothed. If your heavy object isn\u2019t large enough to cover the paper, place two or more side by side to ensure that the full surface is weighted down. Depending on the items that you\u2019re using as weights, it may be a good idea to throw a towel over the paper before placing the objects on top to prevent it from getting dirty."

The amount of time necessary depends on how wrinkled the paper is and how heavy the objects on top are, but the longer you let it sit, the better. Typically, you\u2019ll want to wait at least 24 hours. In most cases, using weight alone isn\u2019t enough to completely smooth all of the wrinkles out of a sheet of paper. However, it can help get rid of some of the creases before you move onto one of the other methods."

Cover the ironing board with a clean towel or sheet before setting the paper down to ensure that it doesn\u2019t get dirty. Depending on the type of paper and what kind of ink is used on it, you may want to lightly mist it with distilled water before setting it on the ironing board. The water can help soften the paper, so it\u2019s easier to press out the wrinkles. However, it can also make some types of ink, such as inkjet printer ink, run, so you may want to mist a test page before doing it to the paper that you\u2019re trying to smooth. If you don\u2019t have an ironing board, any flat surface, such as a table, counter, or even floor, can work. Just make sure to line it with a very thick cotton towel to protect it from the heat."

While you should move the iron just as you would with clothing, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that you\u2019re working with paper, which is more fragile than fabric.
