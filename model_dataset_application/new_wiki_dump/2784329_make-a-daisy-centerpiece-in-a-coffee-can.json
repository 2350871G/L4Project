The combination of the metal steel can with the soft flirtiness of flowers will compliment any table setting. Determine if you want fresh or silk flowers. Today's silk flowers are extremely realistic and can pass for the real thing. Price out both to weight cost versus style benefits. Visit a reputable florist. If you plan to go with fresh flowers, be sure you are getting quality blooms. It's imperative that the flowers that are placed inside the can are hearty and fresh.
