These agencies provide a wealth of information and offer workshops and seminars designed to improve your gardening skill. Fill your growing trays or cell packs with commercial soil and sow the seeds according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions. Water the growing trays well and place them in a warm, sunny spot but avoid setting them on top of radiators or other heating elements."

Clipping unwanted seedlings may seem tedious and difficult to do but unless you have an unusually large garden, you don\u2019t need 35 pepper plants. It\u2019s much better and easier to grow five health plants than to have a dismal array of withered vegetables and flowers."
