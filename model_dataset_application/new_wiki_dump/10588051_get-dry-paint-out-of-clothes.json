Check the label on the tube or can of paint you used to see if it says \u2018latex\u2019 or \u2018acrylic latex.\u2019 Proceed with the following method if the paint is latex-based, also called water-based. If you can\u2019t find the original paint tube or container and still aren\u2019t sure, try testing a small area of the surface you were painting. Dip a cotton ball into a little bit of denatured alcohol and rub it over a tiny surface area of your painting project. If the paint comes off, it\u2019s latex-based. If it doesn\u2019t come off, it\u2019s oil-based. If you don\u2019t want to risk wiping paint off your project, think back to how you cleaned your brush. Oil paints require solvents like mineral spirits or turpentine to wash brushes, whereas latex-based paints only need water."
