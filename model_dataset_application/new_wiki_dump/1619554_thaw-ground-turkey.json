Place the ground turkey, in its packaging, in a dish or a plastic bag just in case it leaks. Put the ground turkey on a shelf or in a drawer in your fridge away from any open foods, such as fruits and vegetables, just in case there are any leaks. Never thaw frozen ground turkey on the counter because bacteria can develop on the outer parts of the meat that warm up first."

          "description":"The ground turkey will stay good up to 2 days after it thaws. Refreeze it within this timeframe if you will not be able to cook it all. If you don\u2019t want to wait until the turkey is thawed all the way, keep in mind that it is perfectly safe to cook it while it is still all or partly frozen. It will just take about 50% longer to cook this way than thawed ground turkey. You can also finish thawing the turkey in a dish of cold water or in the microwave. Keep in mind that the meat will begin to lose quality the more you thaw and refreeze it. This is due to loss of moisture every time you thaw it out."
