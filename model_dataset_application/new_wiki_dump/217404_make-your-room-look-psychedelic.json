          "headline":"Invest in a blacklight.",
          "description":"Blacklights are staples for psychedelic rooms. Paired with some posters, or even just a lot of white fabrics, black lights lend a trippy, hazy quality to any bedroom. Blacklights can be long, cylindrical lights, or you can purchase standard-sized black light bulbs to be placed in a lamp or overhead light."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Drape scarves over lamps.",
          "description":"To create a muted, flowy look, drape transparent scarves over your lamps each time you turn them on. This will soften the light of the lamp, and create different tones depending on the color of the scarf. Most thrift stores have an abundance of vintage scarves, so there is no need to spend a lot of money to achieve this effect. Don\u2019t hang fabric too close to light bulbs or leave it there for a long time since it could be a fire hazard. Try draping a scarf over a ceiling light to make your whole room look hazy."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Enlist the help of sheer, lightweight curtains.",
          "description":"Lightweight curtains are a must for the windows, as they also mute light and create a softer, lighter touch. Avoid covering up all of the light coming in through the windows with heavy blinds or heavy, dark curtains. Opt for sheer curtains. Psychedelic rooms thrive on sunlight during the day. Rely on natural light as much as possible. Natural light creates a hazy, dreamy effect that artificial lighting cannot quite replicate. If you can, choose the room with the most natural light for your psychedelic room."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use string lights.",
          "description":"String lights are great for drawing attention to a large tapestry, highlighting a rustic wooden headboard, or even curled around the base of your mid-century furniture. Although you can use standard Christmas tree lights, many companies now have smaller LED lights in various colors and shapes. Some companies have string lights that run on solar power. This can lend a hand to a hippie vibe in your room, as solar power reduces the need for carbon-based power sources. Look for string lights with different covers, such as stars or medallions to add new funky shapes to your room."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Get a lava lamp.",
          "description":"The final piece of the lighting puzzle is a lava lamp. Although they don\u2019t give off a ton of light, the dancing shapes and trippy lava effect are absolute staples in creating a psychedelic, 60s and 70s themed room. If you are buying a lava lamp secondhand, request to plug it in before purchasing. The elements of the lamp can break down over time, and dissipate entirely, or stop warming enough to move around in the lamp."

          "description":"You can purchase vintage memorabilia on eBay, Etsy, or in thrift stores, or you can make use of stores such as Target that occasionally carry items in the style of the psychedelic era. Memorabilia might be larger, including bean bag chairs, or might be small, such as a mushroom-themed trinket. You can also make use of wicker, whether that is in the form of baskets, shelves, or furniture. Look for movie and music posters from the 70s to hang on your walls."

          "description":"Although black lights are great on their own, they really pop when paired with black light posters with cool designs and wild colors. Stores such as Wal-Mart frequently carry black light posters, but they can also be found on sites such as eBay and Etsy. Black light posters are widely varied, so you can probably find a poster that you\u2019ll like. Designs include flowers, buses, landscapes, mandalas, and even abstract designs."

          "headline":"Decorate with scarves and tapestries.",
          "description":"Draping, flowing fabric is a staple of psychedelic decorating, so adorn your walls with large tapestries of peace signs, celestial bodies, mandalas, and other psychedelic images. A lot of companies sell simple, light tapestries that can be hung up with a pushpin or temporary hook. If you live in a dorm or apartment, these will help you decorate without doing any damage to the walls. Hang a scarf or rug over a wooden rod and hang it on your wall to make an easy tapestry."

          "headline":"Use peace signs, mushrooms, and VW van images.",
          "description":"When searching for decor for your psychedelic room, look for peace signs, VW vans, and mushrooms, as all of these items are associated with the psychedelic lifestyle and decor of the 60s and 70s. If you have tie-dye clothing or clothing featuring psychedelic imagery, you can also hang these up on the wall or a hanging rack and use them as a form of decoration."

Pick wildflowers and place them in a vase in a macram\u00e9 plant holder, or braid wildflower crowns to wear on your head or hang over your dresser mirror. If you don\u2019t have wildflowers or are in the midst of winter, you can also bring fake flowers into your decor, focusing on sunflowers and other bright, sunny options. Try putting real or fake sunflowers in tall vases or spreading petals on top of your tables and dressers for a calming ambiance."

Many of these items can be found for a good price at thrift and antique stores. Mid-century furniture is currently enjoying a moment, so try to find pieces in thrift stores or replicas in department stores to avoid a hefty price tag. Look for wicker or bamboo furniture to help complete your look."

Whether you have carpet, tile, laminate, or hardwood flooring, amp up your 70s style by including a high-pile rug in your room. High-pile rugs are not as popular as they once were, but most large hardware stores such as Lowe\u2019s and Home Depot possess a wide variety of rug options."

Candles typically burn cleaner, while incense will release a bit more smoke. There are some scents associated with the 60s and 70s, including patchouli, nag champa, and earthy oils such as cedar and sandalwood. If you are sensitive to smoke or scents, make sure you keep a window open or a fan going."

Hippies are known for their attachment to the earth and nature, so bringing a bit of nature into your room with you will lend to a psychedelic atmosphere. Research your plants before you purchase, as some plants are toxic to pets if ingested. If you do have pets, try to keep your plants off of the floor or similarly out of reach. Hang plants from the ceiling, set them on window sills, and keep some on tables around your room to create a \u201cjungalow\u201d look."

Most 60s and 70s decorating opted instead for muted colors such as mustard yellow, mint green, or robin\u2019s egg blue. Before painting the entire room, paint a few strips to make sure the color is one you like. If you cannot paint, you can stick to tapestries and wall hangings to create the right ambiance."

Beads vary in both texture and color. Whether you prefer a muted vibe (browns and creams) or you like bright pops of neon color, there is a bead curtain for you. Beads can be purchased online from retailers such as Amazon and Etsy, and have enjoyed a comeback in stores such as Target.

To round out your psychedelic ambiance, set aside a space for a record player (new or vintage) and your favorite records. Many new artists release their work on vinyl in addition to CD and digital downloads. If you do not want to spend a lot of money, you can usually find vinyl for good prices at thrift and antique stores."
