Soil probes are narrow metal rods that push through the soil easily when it is wet but are met with resistance when the soil is dry. Push the soil probe into the soil about 1 foot away from the tree trunk until it stops sliding easily. Pull the probe back out of the soil and measure how deep it slid. If it is less than 1 foot, give the tree more water."

Unfortunately, weeping cherry trees are susceptible to a variety of pest infestations. Aphids, borers, caterpillars and scale insects may attack the tree. Spray your tree to fight aphids. Aphids, tiny soft-bodied insects that are usually green or red, can usually be controlled by spraying the tree with a strong spray of water from the garden hose. This crushes them and knocks them to the ground. Aphids rarely manage to get back on the tree but, if they return, spray them off again.

Caterpillars will make nests or tents in the weeping cherry branches and eat the leaves. Remove the nests by hand or with a long stick and put them in the garbage or step on them to kill the caterpillars. Consider the kinds of disease your tree might be attacked by. Weeping cherry trees can develop canker, crown rot, root rots, leaf spots, rust and verticillium wilt. Cut away cankers. Cankers are bacterial or fungal infections that cause darkened patches of bark that often ooze sap. Remove the entire branch with sharp pruners or loppers when cankers appear. If  cankers develop on the trunk, it will be weakened and the tree should be removed for safety. Combat crown and root rots. These rots are caused by a fungal or bacterial infection. These infections take hold when the crown or roots are kept too wet. The most common symptoms of these diseases are wilting and yellow or brown leaves that may drop from the tree. When weeping cherries contract these disease they often cannot be saved. Try digging the soil away from the crown and top roots carefully and let them dry for a while before watering again. Watch out for rust. Rust is a fungal infection that causes orange, powdery-looking areas on the leaves. Remove the infected leaves and clean up debris from around the tree. Look for leaf spots. Leaf spots are brown or black spots on the leaves which are caused by bacteria or fungi. Remove the infected leaves and clean up debris. Do not wet the leaves when watering as this is conducive to rust and leaf spot infections.",
