Make sure your knife is sharp so it easily slices through the tough skin of the orange. A paring knife or a larger carving knife works well. Don't use a chopping knife because the flat cutting edge of the knife makes it harder to use. To test the knife, try to slice into the fruit's skin. If the knife doesn't slice easily, get a sharper one or sharpen the knife."

Boiling Oranges to Remove the Pith Place the orange into a pot of boiling water. Put a small or medium pot of water on the stove, and start it boiling. When the water boils, carefully set the orange into the boiling water. Don't drop the orange or you risk splashing boiling water on yourself. Let the orange sit for about ten seconds and remove it. Use a metal or heat-safe spoon to bob the orange around in the boiling water. After ten or less seconds, scoop the orange out with the spoon. Set it on the counter to cool. Make four vertical slices into the peel around the orange. After the orange has cooled for a few minutes and isn't hot to the touch, use a sharp knife to slice the peel. Slice into the orange from the top to the bottom. Make four vertical cuts, evenly spaced around the orange. Pull the peel off and remove any pith pieces. Slide a finger under a section of peel and remove it from the orange. Perform this same task for each of the four sections of peel. Discard the peels or save them to use for another purpose. Scrape or cut off small pieces of pith. Use a sharp knife or your fingernail to gently scrape off any slivers of pith that may not have come off with the peel.
