Use 220-grit sandpaper for a smooth finish that works well with stains. Sand in the direction of the wood\u2019s grain."

Once you\u2019ve added water, mix it in with the stain and test the stain on a piece of spare wood with filler on it again.

Let the liquid sit for the recommended amount of time, then wipe it away with a clean, lint-free cloth. You can either try to strip the stain from the small section that contains wood filler, or you can remove the stain from the entire piece of wood. Apply the stain again to the even, unstained surface for better results. Alternatively, you can apply the stain to the surrounding area to match the wood to the wood filler section."
