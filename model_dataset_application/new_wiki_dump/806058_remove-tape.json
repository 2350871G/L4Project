Figuring out what you're working with will help you to plan the removal job properly:\nIf you're removing Scotch tape, you should be able to remove the tape quickly without leaving much residue that will need to be removed. Use your fingernail or a knife to remove the tape, then wipe the surface down with a clean cloth. If you're removing masking tape, it's likely that some sticky residue will be left over on the glass, though the tape itself should be fairly easy to remove. It's likely that you'll need a small amount of acetone or commercial Goo Gone to get the glass cleaned up. If you're removing duct tape, it's likely that you'll need to spend some time scraping the tape off vigorously, using a putty knife, scraper, or some other kind of knife. You'll also need to spend some time with isopropyl alcohol, paint thinner, or some other kind of cleaner."

Soak the surface by wetting a sponge or towel with warm water and pressing it on top of the surface. Wait for a minute or so before starting to pick at the tape. If it doesn't come off, wet the sponge or towel once more and wait for another minute before trying again. If the surface is not easily damaged, rip the piece of tape off to save time and clean up the residue afterward.
