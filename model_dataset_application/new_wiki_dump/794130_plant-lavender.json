Choose the sunniest spot in your yard for lavender, as it needs at least eight hours of sun every day to grow healthy. Look for a spot that's sheltered, but not shaded. Lavender can blow over in high winds, so it's a good idea to plant it near a wall or other large plants that don't loom too high, but are large enough to block the wind."

          "description":"Lavender won't grow well in damp, soggy soil. It needs dry, sandy soil that drains very quickly so the roots won't rot. Check the soil's drainage by digging a hole and filling it with water. If the water drains quickly, the soil should be fine. If it stands in the hole and drains slowly, you'll need to amend the soil or find another spot. You can improve soil drainage by tilling the soil to a depth of about six inches and mixing in some builder's sand. This helps mimic the beachy natural conditions in which lavender plants thrive. You could also choose to grow lavender in a pot or a raised bed, which allows you to control the soil's properties more carefully and tailor them to the lavender's needs."

You may need to add lime to the soil to increase its alkalinity. A little lime goes a long way. Add just 2 or 3 ounces per cubic foot of soil. If you're using potting soil, check the label and buy soil with the correct pH."
