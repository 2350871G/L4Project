Have a few people write 2 or 3 notes each, and ask them to mix the notes up before giving them to you. Then see if you can tell which notes were written by the same person. You could also ask each person for a sample that you know they wrote and try to match the notes to the right person."

          "description":"The devil is in the details! Whenever possible, examine original documents, which reveal more detail than photocopies. Line weight, subtle retouches, and other tiny details might not be visible in copied samples. Typically, you\u2019ll compare a known sample with a questioned sample. A known sample is a document that you\u2019re reasonably sure a writer composed. A questioned sample may or may not have been composed by that writer. If original samples aren\u2019t available, you can still form conclusions based on letter shape, stylistic idiosyncrasies, arrangement, and other qualities visible in copied documents."

          "headline":"Obtain both requested and collected known samples, if possible.",
          "description":"Requested documents are samples someone prepares and submits for comparison. Collected samples, such as letters and signed forms, are documents that someone created without knowing they\u2019d be used in a handwriting comparison. Both have advantages and disadvantages, so use both whenever possible. You\u2019ll know beyond doubt that someone composed a requested document if you watch them write it. However, since they know it\u2019ll be used for comparison, they might try to disguise their handwriting. A collected document is less likely to be disguised, but you can\u2019t be absolutely certain that the writer actually composed it."

          "description":"Choose known documents that fit the same category as your questioned sample. For example, if you're trying to find out if someone wrote a full letter written with cursive, compare it with a letter you know that person wrote. You'll have an easier time comparing 2 similar documents, and your results will be more reliable."

          "description":"Handwriting changes over time due to a variety of factors. If your questioned sample is dated, try to compare it with collected samples written around that date. Requested documents are best if the unknown sample was composed recently. Obtaining similarly dated samples is especially important when comparing samples written by children and the elderly. Handwriting changes as children mature and can deteriorate with advanced age or illness."
