You can create waves with 1 or 2 braids, or make curls by twirling her hair around your fingers.

If you can, hold her neck and the roots of her hair while you brush so you don\u2019t yank her head. It\u2019s ok if you see some strands come out while you brush. This is normal, especially if this is the first time you\u2019ve brushed your doll\u2019s hair. Take your time while you detangle!

For even tighter curls, wind the strand of hair around a pen or unsharpened pencil. Hold the hair around the pencil for a couple of seconds, then slowly slide the brush out. If you can see the natural direction of the curl, twirl it around your fingers in the same way. If not, curl it however you think looks best! Make sure your doll\u2019s hair is wet when you curl it.

While her hair is still wet, braid it back tightly into however many braids you want. Leave the braids in for a day or so, then take them out for a permanent wave style. The longer you leave the braids in, the longer the waves will last. You can do regular braids or French braids in your doll\u2019s hair. Braid close to her scalp to create the most waves."
