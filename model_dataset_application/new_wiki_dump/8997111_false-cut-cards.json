Your thumb, middle, and ring finger should be holding the deck by its edges. Use your other hand to cut out a middle portion of the deck.

Once you've separated the middle portion, lay those cards flat on the table while still keeping the other two halves separated by your fingers and thumb. Try to hide the break as much as possible, so people don't know you're doing a false cut. Put the top portion of cards on top the cards on the table. With the cards still separated by your thumb and index fingers, peel off the top portion of cards and lay them on top of the cards you put on the table. All of the cards on the table will still be in order, but if done fast enough, will look like you've already cut the deck. Put the rest of the cards onto the table while keeping them separated. Use your thumb to keep the deck separated as you lay the last portion of cards onto the deck on the table. Keeping them separated will allow you to do the last move and finish your false cut. Take the cards from below the break and slap them on top of the deck. Now take your free hand and pull the bottom portion of the deck out from the cards on the table and put them on the top of your other pile of cards. The cards will now be in the original order, but it will look like you split them multiple times.",
