          "description":"Phillips head screws are those that have two grooves forming a cross. In some cases one of the grooves will be longer than the other; if one groove is longer, this is the groove you should use when trying to unscrew your screw because it is easier to use with a variety of improvised tools. Phillips head screws are particularly prone to being stripped, when the corners formed by the grooves are worn. This makes it very difficult to unscrew your screw because there are no longer solid grooves in which to insert your tool. Be very careful when using these methods so as not to strip your screw."

If your butter knife is of low quality and strength or the screw is very tight, then you may bend your butter knife rather than unscrewing the screw. Be aware of this potential damage."
