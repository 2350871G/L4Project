Whether the liquid is urine, vomit, a drink, or some other kind of liquid, the first thing to do when you get liquid on your bed is strip it down completely.

Treating Different Types of Stains Use an enzymatic cleaner for urine. Enzymatic cleaners are the spray cleaners made to clean up pet messes, but they work just as well on human messes. Spray the cleaner on, and let it sit for about five to ten minutes. Blot up the cleaner at the end. Other options for urine include laundry stain removers and a home mix of two parts vinegar to one part water with a capful or two of tea tree oil in it.

Dampen a sponge, then apply a little bit of dishwashing detergent or even hand soap. Dab at it with the sponge. You can even scrub a little to help remove the stain. Drying the Mattress Stomp on the mattress to absorb the liquid. Take the mattress outside. To ensure you've gotten as much moisture out as you can, lay a towel out on the wet area. Jump up and down or stomp a bit on the wet part, which will help release more of the moisture. Keep going until it's not leaving moisture on the towel. Place it in the sun. To make sure the mattress is thoroughly dry, the sun can do wonders. Take the mattress outside to a sunny area, and use a chair on each corner to keep it off the ground and promote air flow. Let it sit in the sun to dry out. Use a dehumidifier or fan. Place the mattress with a chair under each corner so you have air flow underneath, and then use a dehumidifier or fan in the same room. If you're using a dehumidifier, it can help to close the door. A space heater can also help. You can also just prop the mattress up against the wall with the appliance nearby. Deodorize and dry the mattress with baking soda. When the mattress is mostly dry, you can sprinkle a little baking soda on top to help absorb any moisture left.
