  "text":" Making the Dough Combine 2 1/2  cups flour, 3 tablespoons sugar and 1 teaspoon salt in a large bowl.  Slowly shred 1 cup cold butter using crosswise motion on a grater.  Place shredded butter into the bowl together with the dry ingredients. Mix until thoroughly combined using your fingers. Beat the egg yolk with water in a small bowl, reserving the egg white until later.  Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Mix together with a wooden spoon until the dough starts to come together. Using your hands, knead the dough in the bowl. Place the dough in a small dish and cover it with plastic wrap.  Chill the dough in the refrigerator for an hour. While the dough chills, prepare the blueberry filling. Making the Blueberry Filling Juice a whole fresh lemon juice it well.  Place a small saucepan on medium heat.  Combine the sugar, fresh lemon juice, and blueberries in saucepan.  Stir together with a wooden spoon until well blended. Cook for about five minutes until bubbly and mixture has the consistency of jam. Remove from heat. Set mixture aside and cool for about three minutes or to lukewarm. The mixture should not be cold. Assembling the Pop Tarts Remove the dough from fridge. Use a rolling pin, roll the dough onto a lightly floured surface, making a 1/4-inch thick disk 12 inches in diameter. Cut the dough into even rectangular slices using kitchen scissors and set aside.  Grease or line a baking sheet.  Place the rectangular slices carefully onto the prepared baking sheet.  Brush the beaten egg white over each rectangular slice using a pastry brush. Scoop two tablespoons of blueberry filling on top of each slice. Place another rectangular slice on top of the blueberry filling, like a sandwich.  Seal the edges and prick the edges with a fork. Sprinkle reserved sugar over each tart. Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (176\u00b0C).  Chill the pop tarts in the freezer while the oven preheats and remove after 10 minutes.  Bake for 18-25 minutes, or  just until the dough starts to puff up and turn light brown.  Remove from oven. Transfer to a rack and let cool for  five minutes. Serve warm.
