          "description":"Painting is one of the cheapest ways to make a big change to a room. Light colors are always recommended for small rooms or low ceilings. If you prefer dark walls, avoid using white on the ceiling. This creates a horizontal line that will make the ceiling look even lower. Try painting the ceiling a few shades lighter than the walls instead. Pale blue or aqua tinted ceilings give the illusion of distance and will make ceilings look further away. Expert Answer\t\t\t\t\t\tQ\t\t\t\tWhen asked, \"What color paint makes the ceilings look higher?\" Sam Adams\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFull Service Contractor & Owner, Cherry Design + Build\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSam Adams is the owner of Cherry Design + Build, a residential design and construction firm, which has been operating in the Greater Seattle Area for over 13 years. A former architect, Sam is now a full-service contractor, specializing in residential remodels and additions. EXPERT ADVICE\t\t\t\tSam Adams, owner of Cherry Design + Build, responded: \"Try painting your ceilings a slightly off-white color in a flat paint. Flat paint makes the ceilings go away because shadows don't cast on them easily, and light doesn't reflect off the paint. Your ceilings don't necessarily look higher, but they are less apparent.\""
