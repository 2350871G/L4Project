Even if you can't get to the dishes right after a meal, make sure the kitchen is clean before bedtime to prevent an unmanageable mess. Clean out your sink. After dinner each night, wash the dirty dishes that have accumulated through the day. If you have a dishwasher, load the dishes in for cleaning. If you don't, set them in a rack to dry once hand cleaned. When the sink is clear, wipe it down with soap and a dish towel to sanitize and clean it. Rinse with water. This step should take only a few minutes to complete. Spray a kitchen cleaner on the stove top, tabletops, and counters. Then wipe down with a clean paper or cloth towel. Be sure to clean any spots or stuck-on food as you go. It should only take a minute's worth of work. Inspect the kitchen floor for any spots or spills and use the same cloth you used on the counter to wipe them up.

Set rules in your house to require everyone to pitch in. If someone goes in to get a snack, make it clear that it's their responsibility to clean up immediately after they make the mess. Keeping a Bathroom Clean Spray a glass cleaner on the mirror if has spots on it. Use a paper or cloth towel to wipe it down quickly. It should take only a few seconds, and if there's no visible debris on the mirror, skip the step. You'll get to it when you do your heavier cleaning. Wipe down the sink with the same cloth you used on the mirror. If you didn't clean the mirror, simply spray the cleaner in the sink and on the faucet and wipe up. Spend no more than 30 seconds on this step unless you have trouble spots that need attention. Use the same cloth from the sink and mirror to wipe down the edges of your tub, if you have one, and then the toilet seat, and rim. Make sure to do the toilet last. These tasks take only 1 minute to do. Scrub the toilet bowl with a toilet brush if there's a visible ring. It should take only 30 seconds. Leaving a ring to sit will make heavier cleaning take longer. If there's no ring, skip it for later. Spray an all-purpose daily cleaner on the shower doors or curtains and wipe down with a clean, dry cloth. Once you get this into your routine, it should take 1 minute and will help drastically cut down on the build-up of soap scrum. Keeping a Bedroom Clean Take 2 minutes to make the bed. If you're in a hurry, pull the comforter over unkempt sheets, and smooth it down. You'll be getting in it soon anyway. Hang your worn clothes from the day on hangers or toss them into the dirty clothes hamper. Take a minute to put away any jewelry or accessories, which will help keep the room clutter-free. Clear off the nightstands from last night. Remove any old water glasses, magazines, or items you don't need right by the bed, and put them in the proper place. This should take 30 seconds. Keeping a Living Room Clean Straighten up the sofa. Remove any toys, books, or junk, and fluff the pillows. Fold any throw blankets, and put them back in place. This step takes 1 to 2 minutes and is essential in keeping the room clean. Wipe down table surfaces with a clean cloth to remove crumbs, prints, or water rings. Spending 1 minute on this step will ensure you're lightening your load when it's time to do a more substantial cleaning job. Use a hand-held vacuum to pick up any dirt, food, or miscellaneous grime on the floor or rugs. Take 1 to 2 minutes here, and don't forget to zip over the surfaces of sofas or chairs if needed. Clear the floors of any clutter. Take up to 4 or 5 minutes to put away any toys, books, games, or other items that aren't where they belong. With this last step, your home should be in top shape for the day.",
