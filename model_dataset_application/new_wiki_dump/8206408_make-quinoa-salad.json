Place the rinsed quinoa in a large pot and with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 2 cups (470 ml) of water. Bring the water to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Let the quinoa simmer, boil lightly, for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the pot from heat and let it sit for 5 minutes. You'll know the quinoa is cooked when it has absorbed most of the water.

Drizzle a little extra olive oil or sprinkle more salt and pepper until the salad tastes the way you want it to. Serve the salad at room temperature. Leftovers will keep in the refrigerator.
