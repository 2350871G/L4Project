If you are making invitations for an adult baptism, your designs could include a bible, crucifixion symbols, sea shells or other items from the beach, candles or other forms of light, doves or other symbols of peace. Of course, this is completely up to you. If you're happy with a simple border, by all means! Choose whatever speaks to you; it's your (or your child's) moment!"

If desired, include a Bible verse or two that has meaning to the family or person being baptized. Make sure the message condones the right level of sincerity; baptism is a very important event for most believers. Keep the font elegant, but easy to read at a glance. Don't use fancy script (cursive) that is often found on wedding invitations for titles and headers. Include a brief statement about gift expectation. If you don't want attendees to bring gifts, then may be you should suggest they donate to your faith-based organization instead? Whatever your preferences, make them clear. Don't forget to include the necessities! Time, place, occasion, and if there will be a gathering afterwards need to be listed on your invite."

Make sure you also purchase your envelopes at the same time to match sizes. If you're printing at home, make sure your printer can handle the type of paper and photo qualities you're employing.

If you're worried about the shabbiness of paper printing, a simple solution is just to back your template on color coordinated cardstock. Print out two invitations per printer sheet and use the thicker paper as a border -- it will give it texture and durability."

Using cardstock or other thick paper increases the risk of jamming your printer. Make sure your printer is capable of printing on thicker paper, and if it is, make sure you're feeding the paper from the correct tray for cards. After the cards are all printed, attach any embellishments you see fit. It's best to use craft glue -- make sure not to use too much! Gloopy invitations are not the way to go. If attaching things like seashells, ribbon, or doilies, give the invitations 30 minutes or so to dry. Be incredibly careful when stuffing them into their envelopes."

Invitations should never be sent without a return address. If your invitations are heavy, make sure you have adequate postage. Maximum letter weight is 3.5 ounces in the US."
