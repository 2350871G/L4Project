          "description":"Drippings from raw meat, poultry, and seafood can contaminate other foods even before you head to the checkout line. Place raw foods in the bottom of your shopping cart as far away from ready-to-eat items as possible. Never store meat on top of produce or place a bag of veggies directly on top of a package of raw meat. Ready-to-eat foods are items that don't need to be cooked or have already been cooked. Examples include fruits, vegetables, and deli meats. Foods that aren't ready-to-eat, such as raw chicken breast or raw ground beef, need to be cooked before you eat them. Cooking raw meats kills germs and makes them safe to eat. If drippings from raw chicken breast get on an apple, eating the apple will put you at risk of getting sick."
