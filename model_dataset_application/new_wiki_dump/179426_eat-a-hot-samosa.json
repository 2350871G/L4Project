The sauces come in as many varieties as the samosas themselves, with two sauces being the standard offering on the plate. The sweet and sour chutney, made with tamarind fruit, pairs well with potato samosas. Whatever samosa you order, find your ideal pairing by trying it with both the sweet and sour sauce as well as a cilantro dip, made with cilantro and green chiles."
