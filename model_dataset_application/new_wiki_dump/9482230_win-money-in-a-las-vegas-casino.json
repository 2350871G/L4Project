Limit your time at slots and roulette, which have the worst odds, and try your luck at blackjack, craps, baccarat, or poker."

Smaller, off-strip casinos are usually frequented by locals, so the odds are a little better in order to keep them coming back. If you want to play poker, though, it's best to avoid playing at smaller, off-strip casinos, where locals are probably very experienced."

Determine how much money you can spend in the casino in a given gambling session, and only gamble that much. Avoid trips to the ATM to take out any more cash. If you\u2019re going to be gambling in Vegas for multiple days, come up with a gambling budget per day. Separate the money into envelopes and only carry that day\u2019s bankroll with you to the casino floor."
