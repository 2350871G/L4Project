      "headline":"Start shooting at the Flesh Lips with your shotgun.",
      "description":"You will get 1-2 shots at best; don't be too greedy or they might get close enough to attack you. Getting attacked while shooting at medium range is worse than getting attacked at close range, as their medium range attack deals more damage than the close one."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Move around constantly.",
      "description":"Once they get near you, run towards the opposite end of the room; this way they'll never be able to catch you, but be careful when running to the opposite side. Make sure you don't walk directly underneath them or you might get caught by their feet."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Keep shooting and running.",
      "description":"Do this until one of them dies. It takes around 8 shots of the Shotgun and 24 shots of the Pistol to kill one of them. Shotgun is advised when you're up against two of them as the shots will cause damage to both of them."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Use your pistol.",
      "description":"Once you've killed one of the Flesh lips, start using your pistol to shoot the second one until it dies. Using the pistol will immobilize the Flesh Lip and halt its advances towards you. However, this will not work when there's still two of them because the pistol can only target one enemy at a time, leaving you vulnerable to attacks from multiple enemies."

    {
      "headline":"Stay away from the last Flesh Lip.",

      "headline":"Shoot the last Flesh Lip until it dies.",
      "description":"Since the last Flesh Lip will be alone, you should have no problem killing it. Once it is dead, you'll be treated to a cut scene."
