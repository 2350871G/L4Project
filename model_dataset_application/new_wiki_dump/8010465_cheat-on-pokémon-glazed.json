LATIOS\n0199 - JIRACHI\n019A - ARCEUS\n019B - DEOXYS Look up Pok\u00e9mon Emerald codes for more codes to use. Since Glazed Pok\u00e9mon is built on Pok\u00e9mon Emerald, most codes should work. Be careful, as some codes may not work properly due to the ROM already being hacked. Using Codes in VBA-M Launch VBA-M and load the Pok\u00e9mon Glazed ROM. The game will need to be running in order to enter cheats for it. The process for entering codes varies slightly if you're using a different emulator, but the codes are the same for all emulators. VBA-M is a popular GBA emulator that you can use to load ROM files. ROM files are copies of the game file, and Pok\u00e9mon Glazed in a hacked version of the Pok\u00e9mon Emerald ROM. Click the Tools menu and select \"Cheats\" \u2192 \"Enable Cheats.\" This will turn cheats on for the emulator. Click the Options menu and select \"Game Boy Advance\" \u2192 \"Real time clock.\" This feature is required in order for some codes to work. Open the Cheats menu again and select \"Cheat list.\" This will open a new window. Click the \"Add new cheat\" button. It looks like a green bookmark. Enter a description for the code. This is so that you can recognize it. The description has no bearing on if the code works. Select the type of cheat you're using. Most of the cheat codes listed above are \"GameShark Advance\" codes, unless otherwise specified. Some emulators will auto-detect the type of cheat, but VBA-M users will need to select GameShark Advance from the drop-down menu. Paste the code into the \"Codes\" field. Make sure that you are only adding the code for a single cheat at a time. Click \"OK\" once you've pasted the code. You can find a list of codes lower in this article. If the code was multiple lines, you'll see multiple entries on your code list. Try to use only a single cheat at a time. Unless specified otherwise (some cheats require a master code enabled as well), you should only run a single cheat at once. Using more than one at once increases the chances that you'll break the game. Click \"OK\" to close the Cheat List. You'll be returned to the game and it will unpause. Use your cheats. Once the game is unpaused your your cheats are enabled, you can use them immediately. For example, if you have the Walk Through Walls cheat enabled, you'll immediately be able to pass through normally blocked objects like trees and gates. If you enabled the Unlimited Master Ball cheat, you'll find them in your PC. Using Codes in My Boy! (Android) Load your Pok\u00e9mon Glazed ROM in My Boy! This is the most popular emulator for Android devices. If you're using a different emulator, the same codes will work but the process will likely be a little different. Tap the \u2630 button. You'll find this at the top of the controls in the center. Select \"Cheats\" from the menu. This will open the Cheats screen. Tap the \"+\" button in the upper-right corner. This will allow you to enter a new cheat. Give the cheat a name. This will help you identify it later. The name does not have an impact on the cheat itself. Tap \"Cheat code\" and paste the code. My Boy! will automatically detect what type of cheat code it is. You'll find a list of codes at the bottom of this article. My Boy! already has the real time clock enabled, so you don't need to manually turn it on. Tap the \u22ee button and select \"Save.\" This will save and apply the cheat. Only use one cheat at a time (unless necessary). To help reduce crashes, try to stick to one cheat at a time. Adding multiple codes will allow you to switch between them. If you don't need any cheats at the moment, disable any active cheats. Some cheats require a master code as well as the cheat code. Try out your new cheat. After entering the cheat and returning to the game, you should see your cheat code take effect immediately. The process for using the code will vary depending on the code. For example, if you're using the Unlimited Trade Stones cheat, you'll be able to purchase them for free from any Poke Mart. The Trade Stone will replace the first item the store offers. The cheat code list above describes any special conditions you need to meet to use a cheat.",
