If you don't know her favorite foods, you can check out her Profile on the website, or make basic foods. The foods you will need are: Bread, Milk, Eggs, Common Fruits (like Apples, Bananas, Grapes, and oranges), Common Vegetables (Carrots, Tomatoes, Corn, Lettuce), and sweet treats (like Ice Cream, Candies, and Cakes). Wash your doll's hair. She gets dirty too! You may want to wash her with plain water, as some shampoo's may hurt the hair or make the color funny. Wash her a few times a month. Have a spa day. She needs to be pampered, because after all, doesn't everyone? Have a hot tub (this can be your sink or a dish of water), Jars of Beauty Cream (beads with craft foam on top), and \"Special\" foods such as truffles and caviar. (Note: if you have a Ghouls Alive, which is electric, build a hot tub out of an old shoe box or tissue box and fill it with clear plastic scraps or blue paper.) Get her parents. Sure, they may stop her from going to a party or ground her, but they can also comfort her when she is sad, talk to her, be her friend (if she has none), and give her healthy limits and rules on what she can and cannot do. Make her a school. Well, school's not fun, but she may love a certain class or have a special friend whom she meets at school! Make a few classrooms, a bathroom (one for guys and one for girls), and a Casketball Court/Outdoors space. Some basic classes to have are Math, Science, English, and Gym. And you will also need books and pencils (the My Froggy Stuff Channel on Youtube.com has many video tutorials on how to make these). Get her a pet. This can be a common one like a cat or dog, or a bizarre one like a Snake or a Lion! Just make sure you pick a practical pet, for example, a Vampire shouldn't have a Wolf for a pet, and a Fire Elemental shouldn't have a Fish! Give her a house and friends and a place to sleep. This is the most important thing, aside from food! Make sure her house is (mostly) color coordinated, and that she has a bed, a couch, a Television, and a few chairs (maybe a book shelf or computer). For friends you can read her profile and find out who are her best friends. But remember: Frankie Stein's BFF's are Draculaura and Clawdeen Wolf, and Cleo de Nile is friends with Ghoulia Yelps, Deuce Gorgon, and Draculaura. Also, optional: Find her a boyfriend, crush, or other Love Interest. Celebrate her birthday. She'll want a special day just for her, and make the party as special as she is! Have streamers, party foods, and a Birthday cake in her favorite color. To pick a Birthday, you can use a day that's meaningful to her. For example: for a Werewolf who is fifteen, you might  look back 15 years and find out when there was a solar eclipse, or for a Vampire who is 160, look back 160 years ago and find when a Blood Moon or a Witch Trial occurred. For gifts, remember what each girl likes.

(Note: Try not to make your character get too old, after she is 18 or 19 make her stay ageless forever.) Keep her happy! Such sources of happiness are often hobbies, like sewing, drawing or computer games. Also consider scrapbooking, learning the guitar/clarinet/violin, participating in outdoor sports games, and fashion design. Pick a hobby that relates to what type of Monster she is, for example Sewing is Good for Frankie Stein, and Fashion Designing is perfect for Clawdeen Wolf. Making a Frankie SteinDoll Have Frankie be all clumsy and confused. Remember, she's only 15 days old! Describe her beginnings. If she came with Watzit, have him bark and meow at random intervals. Enjoy Frankie's cooking. Food for Frankie is up for grabs. She says that everything she's tried is the best thing ever, so she has no favorite food. Note her clumsiness. Make her trip over her own two feet sometimes. Fashion her wardrobe. For clothes, give her a dress. Extra points for blue plaid or black with white stripes. Don't forget to put the bolts in her neck to good use! This goes double if you have the Ghouls Alive Frankie Stein doll (which lights up and makes electrical sounds). Creating Draculaura Remember that Draculaura is a vegan!  Make sure all her clothes are pink and black. She also loves frills and boots! Choose suitable employment. If you give her a job, choose one that does not involve handling milk, meat, egg or cheese. Design other characters. If you have Count Fabulous, try to make him look as much like a girl as possible. Make or buy her a coffin, and make it pink or black.  Adding Clawdeen Wolf\\/Howleen Wolf Feed her only meats. Hot dogs for Howleen, Steak for Clawdeen. Keep her fashion in her favorite colors. If you have Clawdeen, make sure all her clothes are purple, green, gold, and black. If you have Howleen, any color is okay. Make sure to buy her sister. And use old Bratz for siblings, and old Barbies for parents. She has a huge family! Fashion pet accessories. If she came with crescent or cushion, make these pets beds, food dishes, and don't lose them! Give her a large house. And bunk her with her sister, in the cartoons the two share a room! Have her Howl! Whenever there is a full moon, let her howl outside! Make sure her room is purple, gold, green or orange. A bunk bed is also a good idea. Choose an appropriate pet. For a pet, a cat, dog, hedgehog, or bat will do. All these pets are a good idea for the wolf sisters! Make Clawdeen loyal to her friends and confident, and make Howleen a bit annoying, nosy and fun. These are their personalities. Talk in character. If you voice them when you play, both sisters have Brooklyn accents. They also fight and argue sometimes. Creating a Lagoona Blue or Sea Monster made with a Create a Monster Kit Make sure she has a ready source of water in her home or her skin will dry out!  Describe suitable employment. A good job for her would be as a lifeguard, or working in an amusement park with a water slide. Give her a bathing suit!  Feed her anything you think a mermaid or a sea monster would eat.  Make her walk in any shallow source of water you can find. This may even include your sink or bathtub! Give her a pet that - if it were real - would be able to live in the water. Fish (especially those that live in the ocean), crabs, starfish, shrimp and clams are all good for this. Make her get jumpy in Geology class. For Lagoona, volcanoes, rocks and deserts combine to make a nightmare! Understanding Ghoulia Yelps Give her a job as a bookstore or computer store worker, a computer trainer, or tutoring other (imaginary) monsters in Mad Science.  Make sure she has a computer!  Feed her either brains or fast food.  Note that she is a polite student. When she is in school, have her raise her hand all the time with correct answers to questions. Creating Operetta Allow her to listen to music to her heart's content unless she is in school.  Have her sing! Then, pretend that there are other monsters around and they are going crazy over her. Make her act bored in Mad Science class.  Creating Jackson Jekyll Remember, Jackson appears only during daylight hours!  Make up rules for casketball, and have him play it.  Give him almost any regular teen job. Forget those that would require working at night such as being an usher in a movie theater. Tell him things like \"Forget Holt Hyde, you are you!\"  Feed your pet. Crossfade - if you have him - enjoys toy insects or imaginary insects. Creating Rochelle Goyle Don't get her near water unless it is shallow enough for her to wade. Being made of stone, she sinks instead of swimming. That goes for Roux, too, if you have her. Feed her hard rock candy. If you want to know what that is - go wild with creativity! Use the color gray to excess in her home!  Pretend that any job you give her is located in a fancy building. Rochelle loves architecture. In her home, use statues and paintings. See previous step for explanation. Create aVenus McFlytrap Note that you don't have to feed this one. She is a human plant. Do, however, provide her with fresh water and sunlight. Refer to How to Create a Minimalist Home or How to Reduce Your Carbon Footprint at Home for how to decorate her home. Venus is an environmentalist to the nth degree. Alternatively, just give her a tent. Venus loves camping. Provide employment. If you give her a job, make sure that nothing in her job description involves working with wood. Venus, being a human plant and an environmentalist, would hate that. Take care of her pet. If she has Chewlian, feed him with toy insects or imaginary insects. Pick up all litter you see when you are with her.  Make a friendship. If you have lagoona, make her Venus's bff-they are both environmentalists! Spoil Cleo de Nile Give her a room fit for a queen! Wall colors like gold, purple and teal are perfect. Give her a huge bed and lots of furniture! For a pet, give her some animal that might live in the desert, like a snake or a camel. But don't give her a spider! Cleo is afraid of spiders! Have her be a little bossy, like she owns everything. Don't take this too far, as she wouldn't ever bully someone or take their food, but have her act like she owns the world. Occasionally, have her show her truly nice side and go out of her way to help someone else. Remember that Cleo is proud. Never have her do something that would hurt her pride! Always have her doing everything properly and better than perfect, but have her occasionally fail so she doesn't become a Mary Sue character. Do not leave Cleo in the dark. Never leave Cleo in the dark because she would freak out. Understanding Robbecca Steam Keep her away from water. Since she is a robot she hates the rain and water. If she is in the water she will rust! Adding roommates. If you have Venus and/or Rochelle make them her roommates because they are her roommates in the book series. Remind her about her pet. If she came with Penny, her mechanical pet penguin, have her forget her wherever she goes. Robbecca is very forgetful! Have her be late wherever she goes. Her internal clock broke years ago. Have her regret each Father's Day, and go in the catacombs often. One day her dad disappeared in the catacombs and she always goes down there to search for him. Making Abbey Bominable Be aware of her special powers. Whenever Abbey touches something pretend it turns into ice. Abbey has ice powers! Make Abbey eat Yak Cheese, and pancakes.  Enjoy winter activities. In the Wintertime have Abbey go Snowboarding! Make Abbey's house have a lot of ice in it.  Don't let Abbey date anyone! She says its not honorable! But do show the budding romance between her and Heath Burns (if you have his doll). They can still like each other even if Abbey won't date!",
