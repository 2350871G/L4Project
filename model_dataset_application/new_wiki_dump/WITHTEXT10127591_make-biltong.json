In addition, pour in 30 g (2 tbsp) of salt, 100 g (6.7 tbsp) of brown sugar, and 15 g (1 tbsp) of baking soda. Use a spoon to mix it all together. This creates your rubbing mix, which adds additional flavors to your biltong. If you\u2019d like, you can also use 14.8 g (1 tbsp) of paprika or chili flakes. The baking soda dries out the meat."

Then, place the bowl inside your refrigerator for 12-24 hours. The longer you refrigerate the meat, the more flavorful the biltong will taste. If you\u2019d like, you can stir up the meat every 3-4 hours so each side flavors evenly. Alternatively, use another glass or ceramic baking dish, and lay your pieces of meat flat inside the container."
