Google search is another good way to find online photos. Try using keywords like \"Fashion Fall 2014\", with the season and year for current styles, or indicate your age and personal style, for example, \"Teen girl preppy style\". Put all the photos you choose onto a word or google docs file and print them off. Alternatively, cut out photos from magazines."

Experiment with patterns. If you want your collage to be temporary, pick up a cheap corkboard and some cute pins and thumbtacks."
