In some cases, the information can be inaccurate. For example, in 2018, Japan's EEW system miscalculated the intensity of two separate tremors. Most systems are in beta and only transmit to commercial users. Some systems are developed by for-profit companies, and you may have to pay a subscription fee (such as Shake Alarm). Other systems are government funded but have partners that develop their own equipment. For example, Weather News Japan has a program called \"The Last 10-second\" that requires a JP\u00a5300 subscription to use. The window of time between an EEW and the feeling of a tremor is a few seconds to a few tens of seconds. For example, in the East Japan quake, people had 15-20 seconds of warning if in the Tohoku region. You may not receive an EEW before feeling the temblor. Conversely, you may receive an EEW and not feel shaking. EEW systems do not relay earthquake predictions or forecasts; rather, they share information about an earthquake in progress."

You may not be able to get the alerts in English, but you can recognize the sound of the siren and know to take cover. In California, USA, you will receive an alert on your smartphone that reads something like:  \"Earthquake! Expect shaking. Drop, Cover, Hold on.

These alerts currently are not broadcast on radio, television, or sirens, though research into how they can be transmitted is still being conducted.

One major hazard is a brick fa\u00e7ade, as that could potentially break apart and fall. Drop, cover, and hold on. First, get down to the ground.
