          "headline":"Make a plan with your entire family involved.",
          "description":"Everyone who will need to evacuate in the event of an emergency should be present as you talk about the plan and what it should include. Call a family meeting and include children in the discussion. If you intend to coordinate your evacuation with distant family members, give them a chance to offer suggestions, too. If someone can\u2019t participate in the initial discussion, give them a copy of a draft version of your evacuation plan and ask for their advice. Keep the conversation appropriate to the age and abilities of each person. Small children, for example, might not be able to help with deciding which shelter to choose, but they can tell you what toys they\u2019ll need to take to be more comfortable."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Determine how you\u2019ll receive emergency alerts and warnings.",
          "description":"A weather radio, which runs on batteries, is a great way to stay up-to-date in the event of a hurricane. It typically broadcasts updates from the National Weather Service office on a continual loop. Sign up for text, email, or even Twitter alerts from local emergency agencies, too. For example, reach out to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or your local police department to see if they offer electronic disaster alerts for your area. Keep fresh batteries in your radio and make sure to have extras on-hand in case they die out. In the event of a hurricane, you\u2019ll end up listening to your weather radio a great deal. While text and electronic alerts can be helpful, do not count on the reliability of cell service during a hurricane evacuation."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Select at least 3 sheltering locations.",
          "description":"If you live near a coastline and need to evacuate from a hurricane, you may need to travel more than 300 miles (480 km) to find adequate shelter. Contact government authorities in your area, such as FEMA, to see what mass shelters are available to you in the event of a hurricane. Call hotels in possible destination cities to inquire about rates and make a reservation if you are sure of your evacuation date. If you are involved in a church or other organization, inquire about their plans in the event of a hurricane. You might find that they have a plan in place to set up a shelter at a specific location. Don\u2019t discount the possibility of staying with friends or relatives. This option is a great deal cheaper than a hotel and will give you more privacy than a mass shelter. Consider how much space you\u2019ll need and your budget as well. If you are travelling with a large family, a mass shelter will be the cheaper option. However, if you are travelling with a pet, a hotel might be more expensive, but you\u2019ll likely get to keep your animal with you."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Map out your potential evacuation routes.",
          "description":"In the event of an evacuation, the roads will likely be flooded with people trying to leave the area. For each shelter destination, come up with 2-3 different ways of getting there. This may mean taking different highway routes or even going with public transportation instead. Invest in a good map app and think about taking backroads for some of the way to get away from traffic if you can. Write down general directions for each of your routes, so that you won\u2019t be completely reliant on your phone, in case it dies or loses service. Check with local emergency officials to see what evacuation routes are suggested for your area. Taking an official route might save you time and be safer."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Establish a family and household communication plan.",
          "description":"If your family evacuates from a hurricane, decide how they will communicate or contact one another to get ready. Create a phone chain list to determine who is responsible for contacting who. Decide if talking or texting will be your primary contact type. It\u2019s also a good idea to set a standard response time to keep anyone from getting overly worried. For example, if you are a family member and receive the text message \u201cEvacuate\u201d from another family member, then you need to respond in less than 30 minutes. This is an especially important step if you have an extended family to evacuate or if you live in a large city where it might take a while to get everyone together."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Make an evacuation kit.",
          "description":"Your emergency kit should be stocked with items that would make it possible for you, and your family, to survive for at least 72 hours without assistance. Place all of the items in plastic storage bags to protect them and they should all go in a duffle bag(s) or portable bin(s). Your kit should include: 3 days of non-perishable food for each person; 3 gallons of water per person; flashlight; extra batteries; first aid kit; all electronics chargers; maps; financial and personal documents; prescription medications; personal toiletry items; changes of clothes. Create a separate car emergency kit as well. It should include a flashlight, signal flares, jumper cables, and perhaps extra gallons of gas. It is common for gas stations to run out during an evacuation. Good examples of evacuation food would include granola bars, dried fruit, or crackers. Bring your insurance documents and anything that might be irreplaceable, such as an original birth certificate or social security card.
