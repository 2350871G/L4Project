A Japanese garden with blooming cherry blossoms, bamboo accents, and tranquil fountains. A woodland garden with large trees, shade-loving plants, fairy decorations, and bold, richly-colored flowers."

Decide what color combination you want and choose flowers, containers, decorations, and furniture within that color scheme. Look at gardening websites or magazines for inspiration. For instance, if you choose a blue and yellow color combination, plant flowers like irises and black eyed susans, use blue and yellow planters, and select furniture and garden art in either of these colors. If you want a pink and purple theme, try planting flowers like azaleas and bellflowers, hanging pink and purple wind chimes, and displaying pink or purple garden sculptures."

If you imagine yourself sitting amongst the flowers, set up a bench or chairs in the middle of the garden. If you would like to have meals with family and friends in your garden, set up a dining area in a spot with adequate lighting or shade to make it comfortable. Visit your local gardening center or home improvement store to look for special garden furniture that is rain-resistant and comfortable."
