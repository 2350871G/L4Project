Clean off all the slopes on your property to remove material that might come loose. Move this debris away from the slope, on the base, or off your property altogether. You might need a professional with heavy equipment to remove heavy rocks and soil. Consult a contractor on hauling away heavy material like this. Be courteous to your neighbors when you relocate this material. Don't put them in a place where they could slide onto your neighbors' property."

Whether you have scrap wood, lawn cuttings, or spare parts, pile all debris at least 10 feet (3.0 m) away from the edge. Keep any loose material like firewood or trash cans away from the slope as well. Don\u2019t dump water at the top of the slope either. This can gradually erode the soil and make it looser."
