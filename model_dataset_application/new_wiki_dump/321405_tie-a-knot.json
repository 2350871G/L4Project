          "description":"This knot, also called a bowline hitch, makes a fixed loop at the end of a rope or string. The loop can be secured over an object like a post or passed through a ring or hole before the knot is tied. Hold one end of the string in each hand. Make a loop with the end of the string in your left hand. The end should be under the main portion of the string. Put the end of the string that is in your right hand through the loop that you have made with your left. The right hand end should come towards you as it goes through the loop. Bring the right end up and around the left end (that should be pointing up since you created the loop with it.) Pull the right end back through the loop. This time the end should go away from you.

Cross the end in your right hand (end A) over the end in your left hand (end B) so that the rope forms an X.\nWrap end A so that it goes under end B and comes up again. Bring end A back over end B to form a half-knot. Place the top of end A over the top of end B. Bring end A back over end B to form an overhand knot.

Take a small rope or chord (rope A) and pull it under the rope you want to climb (rope B.) Form a loop with rope A and pull the loop over rope B. The two ends of rope A should hang down under rope B. Pull the loop over rope B and around again so that it is back up on the other side. Repeat this step three to five times, depending on the thickness of your rope. Bring the ends of rope A through the loop. Doing this will secure rope A to rope B. When you pull on the ends of rope A, the knot will stay in place. When you loosen the knot, the knot will be able to slide up and down rope B."

Tying Knots for Specific Uses Palomar knot is used to secure a fishing line to the hook. Put one end of the fishing line (end A) through the round hole at the top of the hook. Pull the same end back through the hole but be sure to not pull it all the way. You should have a loop on one side of the hole and the two ends of the line on the other. Create circle by bringing the loop over and forming a loop on top of the two ends. Wrap the end of the loop through the hole created but do not pull it tight yet. Pull the hook through the end of the loop (which should be rather small now.) Pull the hook and ends of the line in opposite directions so that the knot is tightened. Cut off the end of the line that is not connected to the fishing pole. Chinese Sliding knots are useful when making adjustable necklaces. Lay the ends of the string so that the ends lie parallel to each other. They should run parallel for about four inches (10 cm). Pull the end of the right chord (end A) so that it doubles back four inches (10 cm). It should make a long C shape. Hold the chord down and loop the same end back four inches (10 cm) leaving some chord at the end of end A (you will need it to finish the knot.) Wrap end A around all of the stacked up lengths of switch-backing chord. Wrap the end from front to back several times. Feed end A through the loop. Slide the wrapped loops down so that the knot is tightened. End B (the left end) should be able to move freely when pulled. Make another of these knots if you wish. Quick release knots are used to tie a horse up so that when required the rope can be released by pulling the loose end. Take a rope and fold it in half. Take the loop made in the middle and wrap it around a pole from the back of the pole to the front. The left side of the rope will be the quick-release end (end A) and the right side of the rope with be the standing end (end B). Make a loop (loop 1) using end B. Pull that loop through the original loop that is wrapped over the pole. Make a loop (loop 2) using end A. Pull loop 2 through loop 1. Pull down on end B to tighten the hitch.
