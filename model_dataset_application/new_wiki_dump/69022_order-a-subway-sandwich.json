If you\u2019re typically capable of eating an entire sandwich and happen to be very hungry, order a footlong. If you\u2019re just stopping by for a light lunch, order a 6-inch sandwich."

          "description":"Every Subway offers honey oat, Italian herbs and cheese, 9-grain wheat, and Italian bread. Italian and honey oat are classic sandwich choices, while 9-grain wheat provides a healthier option. Italian herbs and cheese has the strongest flavor profile. Select your bread based on what you\u2019re in the mood for, and what kind of sandwich that you\u2019re getting. Some Subways offer other bread options as well. You may run across hearty Italian, jalapeno cheese, or rosemary and sea salt. These breads all have unique flavor profiles, and you can choose one if you want to try something new. Subway also offers a flatbread, but it isn\u2019t as healthy as some of their other breads, like the Italian bread. Choose it for the texture, not the healthiness factor. Some Subways offer lettuce wraps, regular wraps, and gluten-free bread if you\u2019d really like to keep the calories to a minimum."

Most of the menu items are named after their meat, like the Classic Tuna or Rotisserie-Style Chicken. Some of the sandwiches have slightly ambiguous names, like the Cold Cut Combo or Spicy Italian. If you want to know the traditional contents of each sub, you can either ask the sandwich artist or consult a menu. If you\u2019re getting turkey, ask to upgrade it to the Subway carved turkey. It\u2019s a deli-style cut that offers a better texture, and it usually doesn\u2019t cost very much."

It\u2019s a meatless option, and is high in protein and carbohydrates. You don\u2019t have to order meat if you don\u2019t want it. You can always start by jumping right into the vegetables. The Veggie Delight is a vegetarian sandwich that features no meat."

Deciding between toasted or untoasted boils down to whether you want your sandwich to be warm or not. The oven will make your bread a little crispy and usually adds a delightful texture to your sandwich."

Say, \u201cOnly a little lettuce\u201d or, \u201cPlease add more tomatoes,\u201d and they\u2019ll adjust your order accordingly.

If you\u2019re looking for a specific sauce, ask to see if they have it even if it\u2019s not listed on the menu. Try to avoid mixing sweet toppings with spicy or salty sauces and vice versa. A Sweet Onion Teriyaki Chicken sandwich with banana peppers and olives probably won\u2019t pair well with a spicy chipotle sauce."
