Maintain adequate humidity with a humidifier or a humidity tray, which is a shallow dish or pan filled with pebbles and water. Set the humidity tray below the umbrella plant.

To age the water, fill the watering container a few days before watering the plant and leave it uncovered. This will allow the chlorine to dissipate and the water will be at room temperature when the plant is watered. This is a tropical plant that can be stressed by fresh, cold tap water. If the leaves become wrinkled, the plant is not getting enough water. If it is being overwatered, the leaves will turn black and drop."

          "description":"Give the dwarf umbrella plant a balanced houseplant fertilizer that is designed for foliage plants during the spring, summer and fall. A fertilizer ratio of 8-8-8 or 10-10-10 is fine. Use a liquid, water-soluble fertilizer mixed at half the rate recommended by the manufacturer. A common half-strength dilution rate is about \u00bd teaspoon of fertilizer per gallon of water, but this varies. Pour the fertilizer solution evenly over the potting soil every two weeks immediately following a regular watering. Do not give the umbrella plant fertilizer before watering it as this could burn the roots. Fertilizer should not be given to the plant in the winter. The plant grows very slowly during the winter season and will not utilize the fertilizer."
