  "text":" Boiling the Eggs Boil the eggs. Place them in a single layer saucepan, covered with enough water so that 1 \u00bd inches (2cm) of water sits above the eggs. Turn the heat to high. Allow water to come to a rolling boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 1 minute. Remove from the heat. Cover for 14 minutes. Rinse the eggs by running them under cold water continuously for 1 minute.  Preparing the Boiled Eggs Crack and peel the boiled eggs. Carefully remove the shell and rinse with cool water to ensure that all of the shell has been removed. Gently dry with a paper towel. Slice the eggs in half, lengthwise. Lift out the yolks, placing them into a glass bowl (slip a teaspoon in to help shift the boiled yolks out neatly). Set the whites aside. Making the Deviled Eggs Mash the yolks. Add the mayonnaise, vinegar, mustard, salt and pepper and mix to combine well. Spoon or pipe an even amount of the mixture into the waiting egg whites. Top each one with a pinch of paprika. Creating the Deviled Egg Flower Count the number of deviled eggs you have prepared. For example, if you cooked six eggs, you'll have 12 prepared deviled eggs. Locate a large, rectangular white platter to showcase the deviled egg flower.  Create the flower base first. Working from the bottom of the platter upwards, lay sprouts of any sort (alfalfa, clover, broccoli, onion, etc) across the bottom of the platter as pictured. The sprouts serve as the grass. Fresh sprigs of dill will also work just as well. Peel a long stem from a young, fresh leek, green onion, or chive. This will act as the flower stem. Consider adding \u201cleaves\u201d by adding smaller leek stems to the sides of your main stem. Arrange the deviled eggs. Place the deviled eggs in a circular pattern, beginning at the top of the leek stem. Leave a center hole. Place one deviled egg in the center. This will form the middle part of the flower. Top with a small edible flower. Or, you could top with a special garnish like chopped chives, pimento or relish. It's your choice. Finished. Serve in the middle of a table or as a party platter.",
