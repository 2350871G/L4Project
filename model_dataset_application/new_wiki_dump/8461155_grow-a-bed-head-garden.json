          "description":"Choose a smaller area to start your bed head garden, rather than an entire yard. If you go with too large of a space, you might exceed your budget and abilities. Starting small will also help get your neighbors accustomed to your garden\u2019s natural look. Some homeowner associations discourage bed head or natural gardens, and some local ordinances ban or set limits on natural landscaping. If you have any concerns, call your local government office or neighborhood association and ask about applicable codes."

          "description":"Keep track of your garden area over the course of the day. Note which areas receive the most sun and which remain shaded, and choose plants that are appropriate for your site conditions. If a patch of your garden receives at least 6 hours of sun, go with plants that do best in full sunlight. Choose plants that thrive in partial sun or shade for areas that receive less than 6 hours of sunlight. To fully understand your garden\u2019s light conditions, it\u2019s best to make observations over the course of the year. Light conditions will vary as the sun\u2019s position changes from season to season."

          "headline":"Choose an assortment of native species.",
          "description":"Visit a local nursery or home improvement store and look for plants that are native to your location. Since they\u2019re adapted to your climate, native species will require less watering and maintenance. Call your state or local government\u2019s natural resource department or a nearby nature center for help finding a reputable nursery that offers native plants. Plants will be marked full sun, partial sun, or full shade to help you make appropriate choices for your light conditions. You should also go with various heights to add aesthetic interest. For example, you could choose Foxgloves, a mid-height wildflower native across Europe for color. For groundcover, you could go with a locally native fern or ivy. Finally, you could add height with a tall grass, shrub, or tree, like Paul\u2019s Scarlet, which is a shrub or small tree native through continental Europe."

If you want immediate coverage, you can purchase more seedlings and plant them 2\u20134 inches (5.1\u201310.2 cm) away from each other. To reduce your cost, you can wait a season or 2 for full coverage and plant your seedlings 10 inches (25 cm) apart."

For a more natural look, use the borders to create gentle curves around your planting area instead of framing it with straight lines."

          "headline":"Include a walkway for foot traffic through large planting areas.",
          "description":"Consider using a hardscape walkway if your planting area is larger and you need a pathway through it. A path will help prevent anyone passing through the space from picking up ticks that might be hiding in taller plants. Use natural materials for your walkway, like natural stone, wood steps, or bark mulch. When you clear out the planting area, designate a space for the path. Use a rake to spread mulch in a 2 in (5.1 cm)  layer, or position wooden or stone steps to create a walkway."

You can use a do-it-yourself kit available at a home improvement store or nursery to find out the pH and get a rough idea of nutrient levels. A DIY will likely suit your needs well, but for a more thorough analysis, you can send a soil sample to a nearby garden center or soil-testing lab.

Your soil analysis will help you determine which other amendments to add. For example, if you need to add acidity, sprinkle a layer of used coffee grounds over your garden.

Stake a newly planted tree for about year after planting by tying a short stake 1.5 feet (46 cm)  in length at a 45 degree angle to its trunk.
