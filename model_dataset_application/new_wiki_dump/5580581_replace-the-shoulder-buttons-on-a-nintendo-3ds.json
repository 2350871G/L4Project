Remove the game cartridge, SD card, and stylus. Then loosen the four silver screws along the back of the 3DS (they are attached to the cover) and take the cover off. Remove the battery from the 3DS.

Caution: Don\u2019t yank the shell up, as the shoulder ribbons will be holding the top of the shell to the main body. Tip the shell back so that the interior of the 3DS is exposed. Gently lift the body connectors for the shoulder button ribbons off the main body of the 3DS. Remove the three screws holding the cover on the Left Shoulder Button. Place the screws into the second small container, and gently remove the cover. Caution: the L button ribbon feeds through the button cover, so make sure to slide the ribbon out as you lift off the cover. Carefully lift out the L button ribbon. Replace it with the new L button ribbon, making sure it\u2019s well seated by pressing it into the recess on the shell.
