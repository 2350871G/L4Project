          "description":"In order to determine how big or small you want your jewelry piece to be, familiarize yourself with some basic jewelry measurements. There are common, standard sizes for necklaces, and bracelets (depending on if the jewelry is for men or women), and how long you want the piece to hang. For example, different necklace styles are certain lengths. Chokers are about 14 \u2013 16 inches in length, princess style necklaces are about 17 \u2013 19 inches in length, and rope necklaces are about 34 inches in length and longer. Necklaces that fall just below the collar bone tend to measure about 17 inches for women, and about 20 inches for men.

For example, in order to start making charm earrings, you first have to select the charms you want to use. Charms can be found online, at craft stores, or jewelry stores.

That way, you get the hang of the technique with lots of repetition, so your final product is of high quality. No matter what kind of jewelry material you are using, always try to practice the technique first, before using your actual, precious jewelry materials.
