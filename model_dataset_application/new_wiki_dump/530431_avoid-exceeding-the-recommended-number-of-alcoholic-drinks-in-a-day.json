          "description":"It is recommended that men drink no more than 2 alcoholic drinks each day, while women are recommended to consume no more than 1. This is because men and women have a different body-to-fat ratio and alcohol affects the 2 sexes in different ways. It probably does not seem like a lot, especially if you are used to drinking more than this on a regular basis. The feeling of being tipsy or drunk comes from your body trying to rid itself of excess alcohol and become healthy again, so by avoiding getting even a little tipsy, your body will find it much easier to process your drink."

Sip your drink slowly, and savor the flavor of your beverage to make it last much longer. You'll find yourself enjoying the taste of your drink more, and nobody will try to buy you another as you will still have a glass when others have finished theirs."

You won't have to drink alcohol to get rid of your thirst, and having a stomach full of water will make you sip your drink slower. By alternating your drinks with water and non-alcoholic beverages you reduce the chance that you will get a hangover or feel off the next day by diluting the alcohol you have consumed."

It is generally best to avoid social situations where you would be pressured to drink, but if you must attend the event, drink water or non-alcoholic drinks."

This shows you exactly how much you've been drinking, and can allow you to notice trends in your habits. Write down your number of drinks in your journal as you consume them to keep an accurate total. It's very important that you are 100% honest to yourself in your journal for it to be effective.

After having a few days without any drinks, set a date in the future where you will abstain from alcohol for a week straight.
