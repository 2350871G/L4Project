These instructions are for heads measuring 19 inches (48.26 cm) in circumference, with additional instructions regarding how to scale the size of the visor up or down as needed for larger or smaller sizes. To measure your head circumference, wrap a flexible measuring tape around the head, placing it just above the top of the ears. The tape should be gentle and flat. Make sure that it it centered over your occipital bone, or the bump in the middle of the back of your head. It is generally a good idea to measure your head size several times for the sake of accuracy. If you can look in the mirror or have someone else help you measure, the results will generally be even more accurate."
