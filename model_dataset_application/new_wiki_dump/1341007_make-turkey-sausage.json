      "headline":"Combine all the seasonings in the small mixing bowl.",
      "description":"This will include: 2 tbsp. (30 mL) chili powder, 1 clove of garlic (minced, either with garlic mincer or by hand), 2 tsp. (10 mL) cayenne pepper, 2 tsp. (10 mL) onion powder, 1 tsp. (5 mL) crushed red pepper, 1 tsp. (5 mL) dried oregano, 1 tsp. (5 mL) paprika, 1/2 tsp. (2.5 mL) sea salt, 1/4 tsp. (1.25 mL) marjoram, 1/4 tsp. (1.25 mL) thyme, 1/4 tsp. (1.25 mL) black pepper, and 1/8 tsp. (.625 mL) fennel seeds. To ensure an accurate and evenly combined seasoning mix, use a wire whisk until the seasoning colors look even throughout the bowl. The garlic clove will stick because of the moisture, so be sure to mix thoroughly. An easy way to mince garlic without a garlic mincer is to place the clove under a butcher knife and slam a closed fist (side of pinky finger down) onto the knife. Be very cautious when using this method that the butcher knife does not slip from your grip or that you slam your hand onto a sharp edge. Season to your desired taste. If you prefer your turkey sausage not as spicy, try less cayenne, paprika, and crushed red peppers. Also, experiment with other flavors such as minced onion, cumin, nutmeg, ginger, basil, and sage to create your perfect seasoning combination."

      "description":"Be sure to meticulously combine the seasonings within the ground turkey. Add the egg to create a goopy texture. The egg will add volume when you are cooking the meat. Your hands will be covered with this mixture, so don't be shy about digging in. Kneading the ingredients completely throughout the turkey will ensure the best taste all around and avoid someone getting suckered into a big bite of intense seasoning."
