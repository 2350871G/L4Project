You don\u2019t want to let all of the trapped dirt loose in your home. Take the rug into the yard or at least onto the porch. As you gather the rug up and carry it outside, be careful not to drop debris from it onto the floor.

          "description":"For light rugs, give them a good shake up and down to release as much of the dirt as you can. Dirt gets trapped until the shag, but it\u2019s not always held tight in the rug. Shaking the rug will allow a lot of the dirt to fly out of the rug. Be sure to shake it with the wind blowing away from you and not to shake the dust out around other people. For larger rugs, have someone help you by holding onto one of the corners. Then you can shake the rug together to release the dirt."

Be sure to hang it so that the shag is folded against itself and the smooth underside is outward. If you have nothing to hang the rug on, you can have someone hold it as long as you are extra careful."

Once you stop noticing dust fly from the rug, it is clean enough. Give it a brief final shake and place it back in your house. It is a good idea to wear a mask over your mouth and nose, especially if you have allergies, to avoid breathing too much of the dust flying out of the rug. Beat rugs once or twice a week depending on whether or not they are in high traffic areas. Rugs that don\u2019t get walked on often can be cleaned every two weeks."

Professional cleaning is typically reserved for Oriental, Persian, or other hand-woven rugs that are significantly valuable.
