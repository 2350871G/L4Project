If clothing cannot be removed immediately, at least try to remove excess food immediately, and coat the stain in cool water. Be careful while removing the offending item, as you do not want the stain to transfer to multiple areas. To prevent this, you can cup your hand over the stain as you remove it."

Gently dab at the stain, avoiding a wiping or scraping motion, as these can bury the stain deeper into the fibers. Your rag can be damp or dry, but for this step, avoid an extremely wet rag. The goal here is not to transfer water, but to remove any lingering tomato residue."

If the stain is small, you can place the stained area into the cold water, instead of the entire garment. If you are using the sink, make sure to clean it thoroughly before using it for laundry. Stains transfer to fabric easily, so you do not want any debris left in your sink."

If the stain is persistent, you can reapply the detergent and try again until the tomato stain has been eliminated."

Typically, the best way to go about this is to make a paste and rinse in cool water. Create a paste of water and cream of tartar. Apply this paste directly to the stain, then rinse with cool water. Baking soda, salt, and water. Similar to cream of tartar, create a baking soda, salt, and water paste, then apply it directly to the stain. Let it sit for 10 minutes, then rinse it out with cool water. Blue Dawn dish soap can be used. Apply a pencil eraser-sized amount of Dawn soap to the stain, rubbing it in with your finger. Rinse the stain in cool water until the water runs clear and no more soap bubbles are visible. The dish soap helps remove the oil from the fabric."

If it is a large stain, you may want to place the garment in the washer on its own to prevent transferring the stain to another garment. Look closely at the item after removing it from the washer. If the stain is still there, treat it again before drying it. Sun and heat can actually set the stain."

If the garment has already been dried and the stain is set in, try rubbing the area with dish soap, an ice cube, or a white cloth moistened with vinegar. Then, launder the item again."
