For instance, you might be able to find a piece of copper tubing at a hardware store that could replace one of the tubes in a chime set. Alternatively, you could just reduce the number of tubes. If one from a five-tube chime set is damaged, you could remove it and still have a four-tube one."

Lay newspaper on the ground, then poke pencils or similar objects through the paper and into the soil. Place the tubes upright over the pencils, and they will stand in place as you work and let the pieces dry. Place toothpicks in the holes where the strings go.
