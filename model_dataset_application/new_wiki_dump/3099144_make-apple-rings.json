          "description":"This is more important for deep fried apples, and is optional for dried apple rings. Apple peel contains a great deal of fiber and other nutrients, so you may want to consider leaving the apples intact for dried apple rings. To peel the apples, use a sharp knife to peel off the skin. You can also use a vegetable peeler or mechanical apple peeler, which is a hand-powered crank device that turns an apple on a spit and peels it with a blade."

          "headline":"Core the apples.",
          "description":"Use an apple corer to remove the core from each apple. It\u2019s important to use an apple corer, because taking out the center of the apple will give you the traditional apple ring shape. Hold the apple still with one hand and center the corer vertically over the top of the apple core. Push the corer all the way through the apple, then pull it back out to remove the core. If you don\u2019t have an apple corer, use a thin, long, and sharp knife to cut out the core from the center of the apple. Cut a small circle around the core, remove the knife, and push the core out through the bottom."

          "headline":"Slice the apples.",
          "description":"The easiest way to do this is with a mandolin, because it will ensure uniform thickness for each slice. Press the bottom of the apple onto the mandolin using the vegetable holder. Use swift downward motions to slice the apple into rounds. If you don\u2019t have a mandolin, slice the apples by hand with a sharp knife. For dried apples, slice the fruit into rings that are one-eighth to one-third inch (3.2 to 8.5 mm) thick. Thinner rings will dry faster, but can easily become crispy and hard. For deep fried apples, slice the rings one-quarter inch (6.4 mm) thick. Lay each ring out flat in a single layer. Take a small biscuit or cookie cutter and cut a smaller ring from the center of each apple slice. Then, do the same with a medium biscuit cutter so that you get a small, medium, and large apple ring from each apple slice. If you have shaped cookie cutters in graduated sizes, you can use these instead of plain circles to make shaped apple rings."

          "headline":"Place the cut rings into a bowl of lemon water.",
          "description":"Fill a large bowl with cold water and squeeze in the juice from one lemon. This will prevent the apples from browning. Let the apples soak for about five minutes. To add a hint of floral nuttiness to the apples, add 1 teaspoon (6 ml) vanilla to the bowl as well."

You can also season the apples with spices such as:\n\u00bc teaspoon (1.25 g) cinnamon\n\u215b teaspoon (0.625 g) ginger or cardamom\nPinch of cloves\nAny combination of the above, or any other spices you wish to experiment with"

Use a deep fryer or candy thermometer to maintain a consistent temperature. The best oils for frying include coconut, peanut, and canola. In case you don\u2019t have a thermometer, drop a single popcorn kernel into the cold oil. When the kernel pops, your oil is ready.

Lay the apple rings side by side, but make sure they don\u2019t touch or overlap, otherwise they won\u2019t dry consistently. If you're drying your apples in the oven, preheat the oven to 150 F (66 C). Set your dehydrator to between 110 and 135 F (43 and 57 C). With a lower temperature, the rings dry more consistently and thoroughly, but will need longer to dry.
