          "description":"Many species of lake weeds flourish when they can take root in underlying soil. You can prevent this by creating steep banks on the edge of your lake or pond, that descend directly into deep waters. Consider constructing lake banks with a 3:1 grade that descend into a water depth of 5ft. This strategy will prevent submersed plants from rooting in the lake, but it will not help with algae or free floating plants."

          "headline":"Keep your lake deep.",
          "description":"Make sure that your lake maintains a depth of 2-3ft at its most shallow point. This will help prevent weeds from taking root if they continue to proliferate throughout your lake or pond. Keep in mind that this will only work for rooted weeds, not algae or free-floating plants."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Create a buffer zone around your lake.",
          "description":"Lake weed proliferation is usually caused by an overabundance of nutrients in the surrounding soil. The runoff from fertilizer in the soil feeds these lake weeds and causes them to grow in large numbers. Create a riparian buffer zone by planting 100ft of natural plants or trees between your fertilized land and your lake to prevent runoff from entering the lake. Choose plants that will prevent erosion and that do not require any chemicals to be applied. If you have livestock, nutrients from their feed and animal waste may also enter runoff and cause weed proliferation. Consider building a fence around your livestock or keep them at least 100ft away from the lake's edge."

        {
          "headline":"Be proactive.",
          "description":"Once you notice a significant lake weed issue, be sure to address it as soon as possible. Continual overgrowth will lead to more serious weed problems. The more you allow the weeds to grow, the more expensive and time-consuming it will be to address the problem at a later date. If you notice too many ducks or feeding fish around your lake, you may want to take steps to reduce their presence. Their waste can contribute to the growth of weeds."

This is a non chemical reusable product that is safe for fish. Some vegetative growth is necessary for the health of the lake. If you use a benthic barrier, leave some area uncovered to allow for natural vegetative growth. Don't cover fish spawning or bird nesting areas."

They can be cut with a sickle or pulled up by hand, then removed from the water with rakes or hoes. Most lake weeds are perennials, meaning they will continue to sprout throughout the season due to underwater roots. You must remove them from their underlying roots in order to be properly control them."

        {
          "headline":"Use weed removal devices.",
          "description":"Depending on the size of your lake or pond, and the weeds you are trying to remove, you may need an underwater or motor-driven device. Controlling lake weeds by hand can be labor intensive and difficult, as these weeds usually grow back quickly. Motor-driven underwater removal devices can help cut lake weeds loose under water, like water lilies and water milfoil. There are also aquatic weed harvesters that collect weeds for removal. Motor-driven devices often leave cut-up weed fragments in the water. New weeds may grow from these pieces so be careful when removing weeds this way. For surface algae in smaller bodies of water, water pumps can circulate the top layer of water to prevent algal scum from settling. Mechanical control of lake weeds can be likened to mowing a lawn. These devices will trim the weeds, but it is a temporary solution."

          "headline":"Dredge and deepen the lake.",
          "description":"If the weed problem is severe, and weeds cover over 25% of the lake surface, consider dredging and deepening the lake. This will remove existing weeds and the bottom layer of sediment, as well as any underlying nutrients that cause weed proliferation. Dredging and deepening will reveal a layer of nutrient-poor soil, limit the amount of sunlight weeds are exposed to, and make it more difficult for weeds to take root."

If you are unsure of the weed, call your county extension office or an herbicide dealer to make sure you buy the effective herbicide. Make sure you understand the effects and implications of applying an herbicide before doing so. Read the label on your herbicide to understand the restrictions and wait time on boating, swimming, and fishing before applying. This may be an important factor when choosing an herbicide. Herbicide comes in both liquid and solid form, as sprays or granules. For algal weed control, consider using copper sulfates or copper chelates, such as Cutrine Plus. These can be applied directly to the infested area as per the instructions on the label. For certain submersed plants, such as pond weeds, and free-floating plants, such as duckweed, consider using a diquat or fluridone. Rooted-floating plants, such as water-lilies, and emergent plants, such as cattails, are best treated with glyphosate. Check your local and state regulations before using herbicides in a body of water. Permits are required for some types of applications."

Keep in mind that grass carp will eat almost any submerged vegetation, not just invasive species or weeds. Grass carp will not help much with duckweed or watermeal. It is recommended that you stock 15 to 30 fish per acre of lake. Get carp that are at least ten or twelve inches long. Grass carp can be invasive.

You can research your particular weed to see if there is an insect species that may help. You might also reach out to your local department of wildlife or agriculture, Noxious Weed Control Board, or an ecologist.
