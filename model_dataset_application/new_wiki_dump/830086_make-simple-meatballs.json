Pinch the meat between your fingers to blend instead of kneading or smashing the meat. If not using your hands, a sturdy wooden spatula or spoon will do. Mix as little as possible for the best texture-- just until everything is well mixed. The more you mix the meat, the tougher it gets."

You can make bigger or smaller meatballs, of course, but know that you must adjust cooking times accordingly. Larger meatballs will take longer to cook, and you must be careful not to let the outsides burn while the insides finish. Smaller meatballs may dry out if you're not careful -- they must hit the heat and come off quicker."

But the best way to cook meatballs is in the sauce they were served. Hit up an 3/4-inch of sauce to a simmer and then just dump the meatballs in, turning occasionally for 30 minutes. This will bring out a richness in the sauce and cook the meatballs in a nice, tenderizing liquid, preventing drying out. A slow-cooker filled with sauce and meatballs can accomplish the same thing for beautifully rich, slow-cooked meatballs."

Roasting tends to bring out a slightly deeper flavor, as the edges brown and crisp, so choose the method that you think is the best -- neither skillet nor oven is the \"right\" way. Finish the meatballs with 2-3 minutes in the broiler to get a wonderfully browned, crisp edge if desired."
