Hold your mirror up to the wall to see how much space it will take up. Finding a stud can be useful, but not necessary if you have a strong enough hanger. Once you have a good place, mark where the top of your mirror will go with a pencil or some painters tape so you'll be able to measure for the hangers. You can also use those pencil marks and a level to make sure your mirror will be straight. If your mirror is too large to hold up easily and mark at the same time, measure it with some measuring tape or a yardstick, and see how those dimensions fit.

In both cases, you should be sure to mark where the hanger will go, not the screw. You won't be hanging your mirror from the screw. If you have a hanger wire, probably only on a smaller mirror, you will only need one hole. Measure the width of your mirror, and mark a point in the middle of that line. Take the wire in your picture, and hold it taut from the center to measure the distance from the top of wire to the frame. Then, transfer that measurement to your markings on the wall so you know where to put the hanger. If you have D-rings, they will be fastened to the mirror, and not move. Measure how far apart your fasteners are from one another, and how far they are from the top of the mirror. Once you have these distances, transfer them to the wall by measuring and marking from your earlier pencil line."

Most cleats can hold a lot of weight, but you'll want to check the packaging to be certain. A bathroom scale should be enough to get a good weight. Find a place to hang the mirror.

Adhesives are most common with frameless mirrors, mostly because there is nothing else to put a bracket or screw into. If your mirror has a frame, you're probably better off using hangers or other tools. Frameless mirrors are most commonly used in bathrooms. Purchase the glue. Make sure you get adhesives specially made for hanging mirrors. It will need to stick to both the mirror glass and your wall. Plus, because frameless mirrors are normally in placed in bathrooms, your glue will also need to withstand the more humid environment. Measure your mirror. A ruler or tape measure should do. This will be important when you think about where the mirror needs to go. It should lay flat against the wall, so there needs to be plenty of space. There cannot be anything between your mirror and the wall if you are using adhesives. Mark the wall where you want your mirror to go. Use the measurements you got before and trace where you think the mirror would look best to make sure it will fit there. You can lightly mark the wall in pencil to see where it will go. You can also use those pencil marks and a level to make sure your mirror will be straight. Once your glue dries, you won't be able to readjust the mirror without damaging your walls (and possibly the mirror), so your measurements need to be exact. You only get one shot at this. Apply adhesive. Follow the instructions on your glue to make sure you use the proper amount, and put it in the right places on either the back of the mirror or the wall. You should only need to apply it to one surface, not both, but check the instructions to be sure. Push the mirror on to the wall. Hold in place according to the instructions on the adhesive so that it dries. It will probably be quickly, but you don't want to let go until the glue is set. Depending on the size of your mirror, you may want another person to help. Clean off your mirror. Now that it is in place, polish or wipe down the mirror so your surface is clean and reflective.
