  "text":" Preparing Classic Saltimbocca Purchase 6 cuts of veal scaloppine or 6 thinly cut chicken breasts. No matter which meet you choose, ask your butcher to cut them thin, if possible. You can also thin them yourself at home, but this step will save some time and effort. Scaloppine is also known as a veal cutlet, just with a more specific name. Both chicken and veal are used for saltimbocca, but the more traditional recipes are veal-based. Cover the cutlets with plastic wrap and flatten to 1/4\" (.6cm). Flatten the cuts evenly with a meat mallet or rolling pin. If the cutlets were cut thin by a butcher you should still take this step to lightly tenderize the meat. Place one sage leaf on top of each cutlet. Fresh sage is always best. If the leaves are large, about the size of your index finger, then one leaf is fine. You can use 2-3 smaller leaves as well. Lay a slice of prosciutto on top of the sage leaf. Pound the cutlets a few more times to secure the prosciutto and sage to the cut of meat. Use 1-2 toothpicks to hold everything together. The best way to do this is by weaving the toothpick up and down through the prosciutto and veal/chicken. Note that some chefs skip this step, opting to be careful flipping and turning the meat as it cooks. For restaurant-quality looks, however, the toothpick is a must. Place the flour in a shallow dish and season liberally with salt and pepper. A tablespoon of each is a decent start, but you can season the flour with as much salt and pepper as you prefer. Use a fork to mix it evenly into the flour. Dredge the front and back of the meat with flour. Simply dip both sides of the meat into the flour, aiming for a light, even coat on the entire thing. Make sure the prosciutto is covered as well. Heat 3 tablespoons of butter in a frying pan on medium-high heat. You can replace the butter with olive oil, but the traditional dish uses butter.

Once the broiler is off, pour some sauce over the meat and serve hot. You can garnish with fresh parsley or Parmesan, if desired. Lemon wedges are also common. Making Variations Melt Fontina cheese on the tops of the cutlets for a decadent dinner. This works particularly well for the quick recipe, as it already uses the broiler. Either way, this is an easy variation. Once the cooking is done and before pouring the sauce on top of each saltimbocca, top each cutlet with a piece of fontina cheese. Place each cutlet on a baking sheet and broil for 2-3 minutes, until cheese is melted. Top with one more piece of sage and enjoy. Add shallots, mushrooms, and/or garlic to your sauce for a more robust flavor. After flipping the final cutlet of meat, toss in 2-3 minced shallots, 1/2 pound of sliced mushrooms, and/or 2-3 minced garlic cloves into the pan.
