          "headline":"Let your toddler stir.",
          "description":"One easy way you can let your kids help you cook is by giving them a spoon. Let them stir things as you prepare a meal. Depending on their age, you can give them small bowls to stir or let them stir an entire bowl. You or your partner can help them stir by holding their hand and teaching them how to mix ingredients. For example, you can let them mix together dry ingredients for a cake, or mix the eggs into the cake mix. You may let them try mixing the seasonings into dips or sauces. You can also try letting your toddler mix things with their fingers. Just make sure they wash their hands first. Place the bowl on a surface where your child can easily get to it. You may want to prepare ingredients at a table where they are sitting in a chair. If they try to mix ingredients at a counter and are too short, they can easily knock the bowl off the edge and cause a mess. Don't let toddlers stir things in hot pans. There is a serious burn risk when children are around hot stoves."

        {
          "headline":"Allow them to measure ingredients.",
          "description":"You may want to let your toddler measure ingredients that go into the recipes. This may be easier for your child and less of a risk. Teach your child to carefully measure out each of the ingredients and use the right measuring spoon or measuring cup. For example, your child can measure out half a cup of flour, put almonds into a \u00bc cup measuring cup, or place two cups of already chopped spinach into a measuring cup."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Let your toddler cut soft foods.",
          "description":"Teach your child how to use a butter knife or plastic knife by showing them how to hold it, which side to slice with, and how to hold the food being sliced. Then, allow your toddler to help you cut and slice soft foods. For example, you can let them cut bananas, strawberries, soft cheese, and soft vegetables. You can purchase kid-friendly plastic knives that are appropriate for toddlers when supervised by an adult. Teach your child the dangers of sharp knives and to only use the kid-friendly ones. Tell them they shouldn't touch knives without adults present."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Consider letting the toddler crack eggs.",
          "description":"One fun thing your toddler may be able to do is crack eggs. First, teach your child the proper way to crack eggs. Then, monitor as they crack the eggs for your next recipe. Double check to make sure no egg shells get into the dish. You may want to place a towel under the bowl or take other precautions to help keep messes at a minimum."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Ask your toddler to add ingredients.",
          "description":"If you have already measured out ingredients, ask your child to add them to the dish. You can let your child pick up a small bowl and pour it into the mixing bowl, or have them add cut up vegetables and put them in a pot. For example, if you are making a cake, you can let your child pour the sugar you have already measured out into the bowl. You can let them add raisins to a salad, put carrots into your stir fry, or add the cheese on top of your casserole. You can open canned vegetables and let your child pour the contents into the pot. However, teach your child about the dangers of the sharp edge of a can."

        {
          "headline":"Allow them to help prepare produce.",
          "description":"Your toddler can help you in the kitchen by helping you with your produce. This means they can rinse or wash fruit and vegetables before you get ready to use them. Show them how to rinse off the whole piece of produce while explaining the importance of washing produce before eating it and why produce is important to eat. You can also have them tear greens, broccoli, or cauliflower into small pieces. You can also have them tear apart herbs or remove stems. They can mash potatoes, cauliflower, or other vegetables. This is a great way for you to help your toddler learn the names of different foods and expose them to a wider variety of healthy foods."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Give them a brush.",
          "description":"Another way you can let your child help you prepare food is by giving them a brush and letting them help you cover food. Show them how to dip the brush into the oil, butter, or marinade and then how to gently cover the food. You can let them spread olive oil over fish or brush butter over bread."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Let them sprinkle seasonings.",
          "description":"If you don\u2019t think your child is old enough to help with the actual food preparation yet, you can let them do small things, like sprinkle seasonings. Show them how to pick up a few herbs and place it in the dish or gently sprinkle salt and pepper. Measure out how much seasoning should go on the dish if you don\u2019t want too much. If it doesn\u2019t matter, like if you\u2019re adding basil or cilantro to a dish, you can let your toddler pick up some with their fingers and put it on the food."

          "headline":"Always monitor your toddler.",
          "description":"The best way to keep your child safe in the kitchen is to monitor them. The kitchen holds many potential dangers, such as sharp knives, raw meat, and hot surfaces. It takes only a moment for a child to grab a knife or touch a hot pan. Always watch your child closely when you are letting them help in the kitchen. You may consider having another adult in the kitchen with you when your toddler is helping. This gives an extra set of eyes to watch the kid."

          "headline":"Remind your toddler about kitchen dangers.",
          "description":"Your toddler is learning about cooking through you. This means they don\u2019t necessarily know that stoves are hot, pots that have been on the stove can burn, that knives are sharp, or that they shouldn\u2019t put their fingers in their mouth after touching raw meat. You need to remind your toddler of these things as you continue to cook together. Before you start cooking together, you should do a basic kitchen safety lesson with your child. Outline what can be dangerous, what they can and can\u2019t do, and what they should do with the help of a grown up. Make a list of things they can do and things only adults can do. Be sure to explain the reasons so they understand why they can or cannot do certain things. Make rules, like always washing their hands and not touching the stove."

          "headline":"Prevent scalding accidents.",
          "description":"Since your toddler is helping you cook, they may be around hot stoves or pans full of hot food. This presents a danger to your child. To help prevent your child from getting hurt, you should take extra precautions with hot items to ensure your child\u2019s safety. For example, don\u2019t place hot bowls or pans near the edges of counters or in places where your child can reach. Consider using the back burners of the stove so your child won\u2019t accidentally touch them. Move handles of pots and pans towards the back of the stove so your child can\u2019t grab them."

          "description":"Some nights, you may be rushing around trying to get dinner fixed for your family. You may not have the time to watch your child closely, help them with difficult or more dangerous tasks, and talk them through the process of cooking. If you are in a hurry, don\u2019t let your toddler help you cook. If your toddler is really interested in cooking, or you want to include them in the kitchen, choose a few nights a week when you have time to let them help you in the kitchen. Choose a time when your toddler feels good and is not fussy or grumpy."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Plan ahead.",
          "description":"Planning the meals or dishes you want your toddler to help you cook ahead of time can help keep the time stress-free and help keep your child safe. Involve them in easy recipes with few ingredients or difficult tasks so they can help instead of watching you tackle hard cooking techniques or dangerous steps. For example, you may want your child to help you make a salad, homemade pizza, or an easy cake."

          "headline":"Get your toddler a step stool.",
          "description":"Your toddler is probably too short to reach the counter. To help them be able to reach the counter and help you while you cook, get a sturdy step stool for them to stand on. Make sure it is safe and that your child won\u2019t be able to fall. Watch your child closely while they are on a step stool."

Choose a variety of different ingredients and place them on the counter. Let your child choose which foods you will make that day. This helps gives them a sense of independence and helps them be interested in the food. For example, you may set out multiple types of bread, three different kinds of fruit, five different vegetables, and different spreads.

The child can carry one or two plates at a time to avoid dropping, or you can set all the dishes on the table and allow them to put them out into the correct places. If your toddler is going to be carrying dishes, you may consider using plastic just in case they drop them."

While you are in the kitchen, give them some clean pots, pans, spoons, spatulas, and other safe cooking equipment. Let your child pretend to cook with you as you cook the real thing. You can even verbally walk your child through the preparation process. For example, you may say, \u201cI\u2019m putting the squash in the pot!\u201d and have your child pretend to do the same thing with their empty pot. You may also just encourage your child to make music on their pots and pans as your cook. Your toddler might also find it fun to play with toy cookware along with you as you cook."

For example, you may let your toddler pull the top off the leftover chicken, pull the green beans from the produce bag, or open the box of cake mix."

You want to encourage them to enjoy cooking, not be afraid of it. Make sure to thank your toddler and praise their efforts in the kitchen. If your child drops an egg on the floor, don\u2019t yell at them. Don\u2019t get angry if they accidentally add too much milk or they knock over olive oil."
