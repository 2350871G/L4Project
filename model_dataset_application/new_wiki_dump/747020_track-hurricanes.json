Do an internet search of your town, city, and county with the word \u201calerts\u201d to find out if these measures are available in your area. If you're a student, your college or university likely has an alert system you can sign up for. Some communities will send out severe weather warnings even if you don't sign up for them.

Even if the tropical storm is expected to strike a city well away from you, its outer bands may still spawn heavy rains, gusty winds, and even tornadoes. It's always better to be over-prepared than under-prepared. It's also possible that a hurricane may change its course and head towards your location. At that point, it may be too late to take any safety precautions. Within 24 hours, a hurricane warning is typically accurate within 125 miles (201 km). If it's predicted to hit a day from now in a city that's 125 miles (201 km) miles from you, it's possible it could hit your city instead."

Many weather apps and websites have Doppler radar maps you can view. A hurricane is composed mainly of the eye, the eye wall, and the surrounding rain bands. The wind and rain are most intense in the eye wall, which encircles the very center of the storm. On a Doppler radar map, the very center should have less rain, usually green or blue on radar maps. The eye wall surrounds that, and it is usually red or orange on radar, indicating the high intensity of this part of the storm. The rain bands will spiral out from the center as the hurricane spins along its path. The bands can be red, orange, yellow, green, and blue, depending on the intensity."
