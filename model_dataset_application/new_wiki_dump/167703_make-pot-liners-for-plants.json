The material you use simply depends on the size of the pot you\u2019re lining and what material you have at your disposal. Look around your house for material you can repurpose into pot liners. Plastic milk gallons, bottles, and similar items can be great pot liners. You can cut off the spout, wash out the inside, and nestle the body of the jug or bottle into a similarly sized pot. You must use a material that you can poke holes in. It is critical that water can drain from your pot liner."

For example, if you are using a piece of burlap, place it within the planter and mark where the burlap extends beyond the rim of the planter. If you\u2019re using an old plastic carton, mark where you\u2019ll cut the plastic so that it nestles discreetly into the pot. The liner can fit all the way to the bottom of your planter, but it doesn't have to. If you have a very deep pot, you might not want to fill the entire thing with soil. If you create a pot liner that is sturdy and strong enough to hold your soil and plant, you can always try creating one that hangs from the rim of the planter without actually going all the way to the bottom. The planter or pot will appear to be completely full, but only the liner will actually be full. If the liner doesn't reach the bottom of the pot, you can also place rocks or packing peanuts in the pot."

However, you should leave enough material so that you can grasp it when you need to pull out the liner from the pot. Using sharp scissors, cut the liner material along the marks you made against the planter. Place it in the pot, and double check if you need to trim again. If you\u2019re using a fabric liner, such as burlap, try letting the liner show for a decorative, rustic look. You can leave excess material on either side of the liner so that they act almost as handles when you need to pull the liner out of the planter or pot. Just make sure that you practice pulling the liner out of the vessel a couple times before you fill it with heavy soil. You need enough material to get a sturdy grasp."

That will defeat the purpose of your liner! The drainage holes are absolutely crucial for healthy plants. If the roots are constantly soaked, they cannot get the air they need. Plants often die from sitting in stagnant pools of water and developing rot. Whether you\u2019re using plastic, fabric, of filters, you must cut or poke holes into the bottom. This is another huge benefit of using pot liners. When you\u2019re planting in a pot or planter that does not have drainage holes, the pot liner will allow you to lift the plant out of the pot, let the roots drain properly, and place it back into the pot."
