Enroll at a professional photography institute or take classes as your local community college. Don't assume that you have to attend a top photography school. Learn the basics, regardless of where you go, and practice constantly to improve your skills."

          "headline":"Develop your travel skills.",
          "description":"If you think you'd love to become a professional destination wedding photographer, travel and photograph as much as you can. This will give you valuable practice with photographing in new places. It will also help you become comfortable with traveling with your expensive photography equipment. While you probably won't need different photography equipment to shoot destination weddings, you will need to practice traveling and storing it. Consider using durable cameras, tripods, and flashes. Travel with plenty of backup equipment. Putting your photos on a blog will show clients that you genuinely love to travel and can work in a variety of settings."

          "description":"Work locally for a while and build up a client base. Be available to photograph any kind of event (graduations, senior photos, engagement shoots, etc). Not only will you get technical photography experience, you'll also create a network of potential clients. Avoid jumping right into destination wedding photography. You'll need lots of experience to become just a wedding photographer without the added pressure of travel as well."

          "headline":"Shoot local weddings.",
          "description":"Offer to photograph weddings for friends and relatives. Tell them you'll do this at a free or reduced rate. Photographing local weddings for friends and relatives will give you a chance to practice your craft and gain experience. You'll be able to use some of the images in your professional portfolio. If you don't know anyone needing a wedding photographer, find out if any friend or relatives still have their wedding dresses and would be willing to put on a mock wedding for you to photograph."

          "headline":"Work as a second shooter.",
          "description":"A second shooter is essentially another photographer hired by a professional photographer to work the same event. You might talk with other wedding photographers and ask if any of them are looking to hire a second shooter for an event. This will give you valuable experience about what goes into shooting a wedding. You may even be asked to travel for the event. If no photographers are hiring second shooters, ask if you could apprentice under any of them."

This is important to work on since it will help you attract and connect to clients. It will also help your potential clients decide if you'd be a good fit for photographing their destination wedding. For example, you might find that you enjoy shooting artistic or creative photographs. Or you might try to tell a story using a photojournalist style. You'd be considered traditional if you take very formal, posed photographs."

If you've worked in many places, try to showcase your range by including pictures from all over the world or photos taken in different styles. If you don't have many destination wedding photos, keep the portfolio minimal, but include your absolute best work. Show your portfolio to potential clients.

Have plenty of business cards to distribute and offer fliers that showcase your work. Talk with management at the location you're photographing to see if you can be listed in their brochures as a recommended or featured wedding photographer. Many couples rely on photographer recommendations when getting married away from home."

For a single day's work, you'll have to schedule several days to travel and prepare. It may be difficult to schedule destination weddings as well as local events throughout the week.

For example, try to offer 3 or 4 packages in a variety of price ranges. You should also only offer what you feel comfortable providing. For example, don't offer videographer service if you don't want to be filming throughout part of the ceremony. Each package option should list a price and what it includes (like a certain number of hours coverage, prints, online galleries, videographer services, or second shooters)."

Since you'll be traveling, you should also decide if you'll be charging travel expenses or if you'll include that as part of your overall package fee.
