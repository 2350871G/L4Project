Wear black or dark blue to keep you hidden from your opponents. Wear something comfortable. You\u2019re going to be running around a lot, so make sure that you\u2019re not wearing any heavy or baggy clothing."

To make it harder to hit your sensors, tighten your vest so that it doesn\u2019t wobble around. To tighten your vest, push it all the way up on your torso, and then tighten and buckle the shoulder and side straps. Some vests go off accidentally if they\u2019re too loose. Make sure that it\u2019s tight by double-checking the shoulder and side straps before the game starts. If your vest is loose, it\u2019ll be easier to hear it rattling around when you\u2019re moving.

Before the game starts, discuss a general strategy for working together. This could be as simple as assigning roles, or as complex as setting up specific plays. Consider using simple hand signals to indicate the location of an enemy, or ask for covering fire. Split your team into two smaller teams and use one for offense and one for defense if you\u2019re playing a game of base defense or capture the flag."
