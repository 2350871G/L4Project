  "text":" Making a Cheesesteak with Real Cheese Take a partially-frozen hanger steak and cut it very thin. A thin cut of steak will cook very quickly and will let the different flavors \u2014 cheese, onions, peppers \u2014 intermingle, with your bread as the bed. You can cut the partially-frozen steak with a large, sharp chef's knife, or you can use a commercial meat slicer for easy preparation and uniform thickness. Most people won't have a meat slicer; a sharp knife will do just fine, even if it takes a bit longer. Briefly saut\u00e9 onions and pepper over medium-high heat, about 5 minutes. In a large skillet coated with a neutral oil, fry the onions and (if desired) peppers until both are translucent and barely browned on the edges. Stir occasional and salt as necessary. Remove and set aside when finished. Coat the same skillet with enough oil and add thinly-cut steak. Allow the meat to brown without stirring or agitating. At a high enough heat \u2014 and depending on the thickness of the meat \u2014 this process should only take one or two minutes. Do not overcook. With two sharp spatulas, begin to chop steak into even thinner bits. Hold the steak with one spatula while you chop it with the other. Once the steak is chopped into smaller bits, turn it over to ensure that it's cooked on both sides. Cook for no longer than 30 seconds. Add onion and pepper to meat and assemble your steak in a long line roughly the size of your roll and cover with two slices of cheese.
