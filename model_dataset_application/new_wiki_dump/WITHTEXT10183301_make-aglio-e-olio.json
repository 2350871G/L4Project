  "text":" Heating the Noodles Bring a large pot of water to boil and add kosher salt. Set a 5 to 6 quart (4.7 to 5.6 liter) pot on the stove and pour in enough water to come 3/4 up the side. Put a lid on the pot and turn the burner to high. When the water boils add 1 to 2 tablespoons (14.8 to 29.6 ml) (18 to 36 g) of kosher salt. The salt will flavor the pasta as it boils. Add 1 pound (450 g) of spaghetti. Remove the lid and put the dried noodles into the salted water. Stir the noodles immediately so they don't clump together. You'll also need to stir the noodles frequently throughout the entire cooking time. Boil the spaghetti for 8 to 11 minutes. Set a timer for 1 minute less than the recommended time on the package. Since spaghetti noodles are made with different types of flour, it's important to follow the package instructions. Just cook it for 1 minute less than recommended. Reserve 1 cup (240 ml) of the pasta water and drain the spaghetti. Turn off the burner and use a mug or ladle to remove 1 cup (240 ml) of the water from the pot. Set this aside and place a colander in the sink. Pour the noodles into the colander so they drain. Avoid rinsing the noodles with cold water or the oil and garlic sauce won't soak into the noodles. Cooking the Sauce Heat 6 tablespoons (89 ml) of olive oil and the garlic for 5 minutes. Pour 6 tablespoons (89 ml) of the olive oil into a large skillet and stir in 4 medium cloves of thinly sliced garlic. Turn the burner to medium and cook the garlic in the oil until it turns a pale gold color. Slice the garlic as thinly as you can. The garlic will sizzle a little as it cooks. Add the spaghetti to the skillet with \u20442 cup (120 ml) of the pasta water. Pour half of the reserved pasta water into the skillet and add the drained spaghetti. Use tongs to toss the noddles with the water, oil, and garlic. Add more of the remaining pasta water if the sauce is too thick and you'd like to thin it. Simmer and stir the noodles for 2 minutes over high heat. Turn the burner up to high so the pasta water begins to bubble. Stir and cook the spaghetti in the sauce so the noodles are coated. Stir in the remaining olive oil and serve the pasta. Turn off the burner and pour in the remaining 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil. Toss the noodles so they're completely coated with the oil. Divide the pasta among plates and serve it immediately. While you can refrigerate leftover aglio e olio in an airtight container for up to 3 to 5 days, the oil may thicken on the noodles. Trying Variations Add pepperoncini if you want spicy pasta. To make aglio e olio pepperoncini, stir 1/2 teaspoon (1 g) of red pepper flakes into the olive oil and garlic before you add the noodles.
