Go online to find information about your growing zone. Warm temperate sundew varieties need temperatures like those found in USDA zone 9. This means that outdoor temperatures can\u2019t fall below about 20 \u00b0F (\u22127 \u00b0C) for the plants to survive. The cold temperate Drosera linearis likes hardier winters like those found in USDA zones 1-7. Many other cold temperate Drosera species will do well in zones 1-9. As a general rule of thumb, if you live in conditions similar to zones 8 or 9 and only experience mild winters, your sundew should be able to survive outside throughout the year."

Check for signs of germination after three weeks, but keep the pots in the sealed bags until the seedlings look like they\u2019ve fully rooted into the soil. This could take a few months.
