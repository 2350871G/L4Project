          "description":"The game of Snaps is a fairly simply concept that requires nothing other than at least two people, the ability to snap your fingers, and some creative thinking. The basic idea of Snaps is to spell out individual letters of a word using either a statement or a snap of your fingers. There are at least two players in Snaps. The snapper is the person who chooses a word and then snaps out the answer. The receiver is the person who listens to the snapper and guesses the word. For consonants, you\u2019ll say a sentence or statement in which the first word starts with the same letter that you are trying to spell out. For example, if you choose \u201cGeorge Washington,\u201d your first letter is a \u201cG.\u201d You\u2019ll clue the receiver into the name by starting with a sentence like \u201cGet ready.\u201d This lets the receiver know that the first name of the person or the clue is \u201cG.\u201d\nFor vowels, you snap your fingers- hence the name of the game. Each vowel corresponds to a specific number of snaps. \"A\" is one snap, \"E\" is two snaps, \"I\" is three snaps, \"O\" is four snaps, and \"U\" is five snaps. Thus, for the second letter of \u201cGeorge Washington,\u201d you would give two clear snaps for an \u201cE.\u201d\nThere is no cue for a space in between words."

          "headline":"Choose the name of a person that you want the receiver to guess.",
          "description":"Since the idea of Snaps is to guess the name of someone, choose one that everyone can easily guess, such as a politician or celebrity. For example, you can use \u201cHillary Clinton\u201d or \u201cBritney Spears.\u201d\nTry to avoid difficult names or names that start with difficult letters. For example, the name Xavier would be difficult to use because of the \u201cx.\u201d There are no words with which you could put together a cue sentence."

To make it a bit more difficult, you can snap your receiver a clue to the person\u2019s name. For example, if you want the receiver to guess \u201cGeorge Washington\u201d you could snap out the clue \u201cfirst President.\u201d For \u201cMarlon Brando\u201d you could use \u201cthe Godfather.\u201d"

If you\u2019ve decided to use a clue instead of the direct name, you\u2019ll need to devise a clear clue for the receiver. For example, for the name \u201cGeorge Washington,\u201d you\u2019ll need to have brief statements to clue your reader into each consonant in the name or in the clue. You could use \u201cRead the newspaper\u201d for \u201cR.\u201d If you decide to use \u201cfirst President\u201d as your clue, you could use \u201cParty on\u201d as your statement for the letter \u201cP.\u201d"

Before you start spelling out your letter with statements and snaps, clue your receiver about the nature of the word with a simple sentence. If you\u2019re using the direct name of a person, say \"Snaps IS the name of the game.\" This lets your receiver know that you\u2019re spelling out the name of a person. If you\u2019re giving the receiver a clue about the person, such as \u201cRocky\u201d for Sylvester Stallone or \u201cthe Godfather\u201d for Marlon Brando, say \"Snaps ISN'T the name of the game.\" This clues your receiver that you\u2019re spelling out a clue to the name. Give the first letter to the receiver. After you\u2019ve clued in your receiver that you\u2019re giving her a name or a clue, give her the first letter of the word with either a statement or snaps. Most names will begin with a consonant, so you will likely begin with a statement.

When the receiver has figured out the first letter, move on to the second letter of your name or clue. Only do this once they\u2019re ready to go and you\u2019ve either figured out a next statement or vowel, depending on the second letter. Second letters are often vowels, so your next clue will probably be a series of snaps. For \u201cAl Pacino\u201d you will want to snap clearly once to indicate to your receiver that \u201ca\u201d is the next letter. Remember to snap clearly so that your receiver can hear each individual snap. Follow the same pattern for the rest of the letters. Use the same pattern of snaps and statements until you\u2019ve finished spelling out either the name or the clue. If there are any parts that the receiver didn\u2019t get, go back and give the statements or snap series again. Guess the person\u2019s name or clue. Have your receiver guess the person once you\u2019ve finished spelling out the name or clue. If he doesn\u2019t get it, you can either help him or play another round of snaps to solve the name. If you decided to use a clue to a person\u2019s name, have your receiver guess the clue first and then the name. Guessing a Snapper\u2019s Word Pay attention to the snapper\u2019s first line. Make sure to pay close attention to what the snapper says before he begins using snaps or statements. This will help you know if he is using a name or a clue about a name. If the snapper is using the direct name of a person, he will say \"Snaps IS the name of the game.\" If the snapper says \"Snaps ISN'T the name of the game,\" then you know that he is spelling out a clue about a person. Listen closely to the first statement or series of snaps. The snapper will either give you a clue or snap for the first letter of the name or clue. Make sure to pay close attention to this so you get the game off to a good start. For example, if the snapper chose \u201cBenjamin Netanyahu\u201d as the name, he would first say a statement like \u201cBe prepared\u201d to let you know that the first letter of the name or clue is \u201cB.\u201d\nIf he chose the name Iggy Pop, on the other hand, he would first snap three times to let you know that the first letter is \u201cI.\u201d Follow this pattern until the snapper finishes the name or the clue. Listen to the snapper\u2019s statements and snaps until he says that he is finished so that you can successfully solve the name or clue. If it makes it easier to remember each letter, write them down on a piece of paper. Guess the name or the clue to the name. Once the snapper has finished spelling out the name or the clue, guess what it is. If you can\u2019t get it, either ask the snapper to clarify something or play another round of snaps to solve the name.
