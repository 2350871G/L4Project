  "text":" Making Cubed Lanterns Prepare your leaves. Find some leaves outside, rinse them under cool water, then pat them dry. You can leave the stems on or cut them off, but make sure that each leaf is smaller than 8 inches (20.32 centimeters), otherwise it won't fit in your lantern. Set the leaves aside when you are done. Consider pressing the leaves between the pages of a heavy book for several days. This will help dry the leaves out further and flatten them. Cut four 8 by 16-inch (20.32 by 40.64-centimeter) rectangles out of wax paper. You can make your lantern a different size if you want to, but the rectangles need to be twice as long as they are tall. For example, you can make a mini lantern using 4 by 8-inch (10.16 by 20.32-centimeter) rectangles. Fold the rectangles in half widthwise to make 8-inch (20.32-centimeter) squares. Make sure that you are folding the sheets with the wax sides together, otherwise, they won't stick when you iron them. Run your fingernail along the folded edges when you are done to sharpen the crease. Place the leaves face-down inside the folded paper. You can place as many leaves as you want inside each paper, but the light will shine through better the fewer leaves you use. These will be the panels for your lantern. For a twist, consider adding a sprinkle of glitter inside the folded paper. Cover the sheets with an ironing cloth, then iron them until the wax melts and sticks. Place your first panel on the ironing board, and cover it with an ironing cloth. Set your iron to the lowest setting; you want it to be warm, not hot. Cover your work with the cloth, then press the iron over it for 2 to 5 minutes. Flip the paper over, and press it again for another 2 to 5 minutes. Repeat the process with the other sheets, working one at a time. If you don't have an ironing cloth, you can also use an old pillowcase or thin towel instead. Wait for the paper to cool, then tape the panels together to form a long strip. Line the sheets up side-by-side to make a strip with the edges touching. Make sure that the front of the leaves are facing you. Cut three 8-inch (20.32-centimeter) long strips of washi tape, and tape the strips together. For a neater finish, make sure that the folded edges of your panels are facing the same direction. If you are making a smaller/larger lantern, cut your tape accordingly. Consider using washi tape with a wood grain pattern. This will make your lantern look more like a lantern. You can also use black washi tape instead. Consider giving your lantern a border. Cut a 32-inch (81.28-centimeter) strip of washi tape, and place it along the top, long edge of your wax paper strip. Repeat this step with a second 32-inch (81.28-centimeter) strip of washi tape for the bottom edge. Fold the strip to make a cube, then tape the first and last panels together. Make sure that the backs of the leaves are inside the lantern. Next, cut an 8-inch (20.32-centimeter) strip of washi tape, and place it along the edge of the first panel. Align the first and last panels together, then fold the tape onto the last panel. Use the lantern. Get an LED or battery-operated tea light, and turn it on. Set it down onto your table, then place the lantern over it. Avoid using real tea lights, as they can get too hot, and may cause the wax paper to melt and come apart. Making Cylindrical Lanterns Prepare the leaves. Find some leaves outside and rinse them off with cool water. Pat them dry. If you want to, you can trim the stems off. Next, place the leaves between the pages of a book, and stack several more heavy books on top. Leave the leaves there for 2 to 3 days. Get a small, round lid. The best type of lid would be the cardboard or wood kind that comes from a cheese container. You can also try using a lid from a yogurt or ice cream container instead. If you are using a plastic lid, you will need to use a hot glue gun to attach it to the lantern. Cut two rectangles out of parchment paper. Measure the circumference of your lid first, then add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) for the overlap. Cut your parchment paper according to that measurement, making sure that both sheets are the same size. Your lantern can be as tall or as short as you want it to be. Coat one of the sheets of parchment with glue. You can do this using a spray-on glue, or you can paint it with white school glue and a foam brush or paint brush. Be sure to coat the paper evenly, from edge to edge. Keep your work area clean by working on top of some newspapers or a cheap, plastic tablecloth. Add the leaves. You can use as many or as few leaves as you want, but the fewer leaves you use, the better the light will show through! For a twist, consider adding a sprinkle of glitter. Cover the leaves and paper with another layer of glue, and press the second sheet of parchment paper on top. Simply spray another layer of glue on top, or paint the glue on using a foam brush or paint brush. Let the paper dry. To help it dry nice and smooth, place a stack of heavy books on top of it for about 1 hour. Cut two \u00bd to 1-inch (1.27 to 2.54-centimeter) wide strips out of paper for the top and base of your lantern. The strips need to be the same length as your parchment paper. You can use construction paper, scrapbooking paper, or even wrapping paper for this. Try to use a color and/or pattern that matches your leaves. Glue the strips to top and bottom edges of your parchment paper. Coat the back of each strip of paper with glue, then align it with the top and bottom edge of your parchment paper. Run your fingers over the strips to seal them. Wrap the parchment paper around the  lid and glue it in place. Draw a line of glue around the outside edge of your lid first. Next, wrap the parchment paper around it, making sure that the bottom edges align. If your lid is made out of cardboard or wood, you can use hot glue or white school glue. If your lid is made out of plastic, you must use a hot glue gun; regular glue won't hold. If you are using hot glue, squeeze the glue out 1 inch (2.54-centimeters) at a time. If you squeeze it out all at once, the glue will dry too fast, and the bond won't be as strong. If you are using white school glue, position the lid so that the top is facing inside the lantern, then use clothespins around the base to hold the lantern together until the glue dries. Glue down the seam. You should have about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of excess parchment paper. Draw a line of glue along the edge of the parchment paper, then press it down onto the lantern. Place the lantern, seam-side-down onto the table, then run your finger along the seam from inside the lantern to seal it. You can use a glue stick or white school glue for this. If you are using white school glue, secure the lantern at the top and bottom with a clothespin until the glue dries. Add a handle. Use a hole puncher to punch two holes into the top of your lantern. Try to get the hole into the middle of your \u00bd to 1-inch (1.27 to 2.54-centimeter) wide strip of paper. Next, cut a piece of string, and thread it through the holes. Tie the ends of the string together to make a loop. Use the lantern. Get a battery-operated or LED tea light, and switch it on. Place it into the lantern, then give the lantern to your child to hold. Making Round Lanterns Find some leaves you'd like to use, then clean them. Rinse the leaves under cool water, then pat them dry. Next, trim the stems off; this will allow the leaves to lay more smoothly against your lantern. Because the leaves are going onto a curve surface, there is no need to press them. Mix together equal parts of glue and water. Find a bowl or disposable container, then fill it with equal parts of white school glue and water. Stir the two together using a plastic fork or spoon; you can also use a popsicle instead. Avoid mixing too much glue-water at one time. This project may take a while, and you don't want the mixture to dry before you use it all. You can always mix up more glue-water later. Blow up a balloon, then set it down in a large mug or small bowl. How big you blow up your balloon is entirely up to you, but the bigger you blow it up, the more leaves you will be able to fit. Consider placing a small pebble or marble inside the balloon first. This will act as a weight, and help keep the balloon steady while you work. Tear white tissue paper into 2 by 3-inch (5.08 by 7.62-centimeter) rectangles. You can cut the rectangles if you want to, but tearing them will allow them to overlap better and give you a smoother finish. The size does not have to be exact. Start applying the strips to the balloon. Dip your first strip into the glue-water, then run it over the rim of the bowl to get rid of any excess. Place the strip on top of the balloon and smooth it down. Keep applying the strips in a similar manner, overlapping them slightly. Leave the bottom part of the balloon (the part that's inside the bowl or mug) uncovered. You want about a 6-inch (15.24-centimeter) opening. Don't worry if it appears jagged; you can always trim it up later. If the balloon as to get too drippy, you can apply the strips of paper dry. Apply the leaves to the balloon. Paint the back of each leaf before you press it against the balloon. You can use as many or as few as you want. You could even overlap the leaves, if you'd like. Keep in mind that the more leaves you use, the less light will be able to shine through. Apply two more layers of paper on top of the balloon. Use the same technique as before. Again, if the balloon starts to feel too wet, stop dipping the tissue paper into the glue, and simply press it on top of the balloon instead. The tissue paper will stick to the damp paper that's already on the balloon. Wait for the balloon to dry, then deflate the balloon and take it out. Take the lantern off the mug or bowl and turn it around. Cut a hole near the tail end of the balloon. Slowly release the air from the balloon, prying it away from the sides of the paper as you do. If the lantern collapses, wait until you have taken the balloon out, then push the walls back out from the inside. Add a handle. Punch two holes near the top of the lantern, about \u00bd to 1-inch (1.7 to 2.54-centimeter) away from the rim. Next, thread some string through it, then tie the ends together to make a loop. If the top opening is jagged, you can trim it down using a pair of scissors. Use the lantern. Get a battery-operated or LED tea light and turn it on. Place it inside the lantern, then hang the lantern up, or give it to your child to hold. Making Glass Lanterns Prepare your leaves. Trim the stems off of the leaves first. Next, rinse the leaves under cool water, then pat them dry. Place them between the pages of a book, then stack several more heavy books on top. Let the leaves sit there for at least 36 hours. This helps absorb any excess moisture and flatten the leaves. Get a glass vase, bowl, or jar, and clean it well. Wash your glass object using warm water and dish soap. Dry it off with a soft cloth. Finally, wipe it down with a paper towel or cotton ball soaked in rubbing alcohol. This will get rid of any oils or fingerprints that may prevent the decoupage glue from sticking. From now on, try to handle your glass object only from the inside. Coat your glass object with a layer of decoupage glue. You can do this using a foam brush or a paintbrush. If you are working on a large glass object, paint only a small section of it so that the decoupage doesn't dry out before you get to it. Many decoupage glues, such as Mod Podge, come in different finishes, including satin, glossy, and matte. Choose one that appeals the most to you. A glossy finish will blend with the glass the best, and a matte finish will give you a frosted look. Press the leaves against the glass object. You can use as many or as few leaves as you want. If you plan on layering or overlapping the leaves, however, be sure to paint the backs with more decoupage glue. This will ensure that they leaves stick together. Let the leaves dry, then paint another coat of decoupage glue over the leaves. Apply the glue directly to the leaves, then spread it outward towards the edges of the leaves. Be sure to coat the glass part as well. This will help seal the leaves in and prevent the leaves from peeling away. Depending on what type of decoupage glue you are using, it may take 1 or 2 hours for it to dry. Let the lantern dry completely. At this point, you can choose to apply a second or even third coat of decoupage glue. If you choose to do so, let each coat dry before applying the next. Consider adding a wire handle if your glass object has a neck. Get some 18-gauge wire, and cut a 24-inch (60.96-centimeter) long piece using wire cutters. You can use any color of wire you want, but your lantern would look better if the wire matches the leaves. For example, if you are using lots of red, orange, or yellow leaves, a gold or copper-colored wire would look lovely. If you do not wish to add a handle, click here to learn how to use your lantern. A wire handle will only work for glass objects that have a neck, such as jars. They will not work for glass objects with smooth walls, such as vases. Make a loop in the middle of the wire. Find the center of the wire, then fold it around a pencil or pen to make a loop. Twist the wire 3 to 4 times to hold the loop, then pull the pen or pencil out. Use a pair of needle-nose pliers to pinch the coils together. Wrap the loose ends of the wire around the neck of your lantern. Take one end of the wire, and twist it around the other 3 to 4 times, as close to the neck of the lantern as possible. Use a pair of needle-nose pliers to squeeze the coils shut. Cut the wire that you used to create the coils off using a pair of wire cutters. Try to cut it as close to the coils as possible. Use your needle-nose plies to fold down any bits of wire that stick out. Fold the remaining wire strand over to the loop you made earlier. Thread it through the loop, fold it back up, then wrap it around itself 3 to 4 times. Pinch the coils together with a pair of needle-nose pliers. Your handle is now complete. Use the lantern. Because this lantern is made out of glass, it is safe to use with real candles. You cannot wash it, however, so it would be best to use candles that are already in a container, such as glass votives and tea lights. Alternatively, you can always use a battery-operated or LED tea light instead.",
