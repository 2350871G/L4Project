Put a box of books or magazines in your reading nook so they are easily accessible and add a lamp for extra lighting. Use your reading chair or beanbags as extra seating when you\u2019re hanging out with friends or watching movies. If you\u2019re buying beanbags, consider getting a few so your friends can join you in the reading nook. Stack the beanbags on top of each other when you aren\u2019t using them."

Place the couch opposite your bed or TV to make the room look balanced. Put a few cushions or throws on the couch to make it look extra comfy and inviting. Check out garage sales to find cheap, second-hand couches. If the upholstery on the couch is a little ripped, simply place a throw or sheet over the couch to cover it."

If you don\u2019t normally have a TV in your bedroom, ask your parents if you can borrow the family TV for the day to hang out with your friends. If you are using a projector, make sure that you have a blank wall to project it onto or hang up a sheet instead."

If your bed is against a wall, consider placing the throw pillows against the wall to act as a backrest. This is a great option if you are sitting on your bed to watch a movie or TV show. Opt for velvet or fluffy pillows to give your bed a luxurious feeling. Alternatively, pick waffle-textured or linen pillows for a minimal look.
