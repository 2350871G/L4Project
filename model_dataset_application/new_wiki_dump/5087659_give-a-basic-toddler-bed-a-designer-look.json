          "description":"Most retailers only carry limited designs in toddler beds, limited only to the latest trends in comic, movie and cartoon characters. Disney\u2019s Cars characters are all the hype these days for boys\u2019 toddler beds; Disney Princesses are all the rage for the girls\u2019. When it comes to colors, you are limited to choosing between blue, red and green for boys; pink, yellow and white for girls. Therefore, if you want to give your toddler's bed a more unique, sophisticated and designer feel, it's a much better idea to design and create the bed yourself. You don't even have to buy a new bed, you can just re-design an old one."

          "headline":"Consider what kind of material your toddler's bed is made from.",
          "description":"Most parents prefer wooden toddler beds, although there are other types such as plastic toddler bed, canopy bed, portable bed or cot. Whatever the type you have, all of these beds have very basic features; all of them are low to the ground, have side rails to protect your little one from falling when sleeping, and a foot and head board. If you are especially creative and if you have the talent, you can stencil your toddler\u2019s bed frame with designs that you can download online or have made yourself."
        },

          "headline":"Choose a suitable type of paint.",
          "description":"You can definitely paint over the original design of your toddler\u2019s bed if it is made of wood, even more so if the toddler bed is painted white. White furniture is like a blank canvass waiting for the artist\u2019s hand in creating unique patterns and designs. You will want to choose a paint that\u2019s water based (acrylic; latex) because this gives a better gloss and color retention. It\u2019s also quick to dry so this fits your weekend project better. It has less odor and low on VOC\u2019s (volatile organic chemicals) that are flammable. These features are best suited to your toddler\u2019s bed rather than oil based paints that are flammable and gives out a strong odor."

        {
          "headline":"Pick a paint color.",
          "description":"You can choose from a variety of paint colors available at your local hardware or home shopping store. If your toddler hasn\u2019t chosen his or her favorite color yet, go with gender-neutral colors like grey, plum, wine, aqua, ivory and tan. These colors provide an additional canvas for your toddler\u2019s bedroom color scheme. However, you can also work with whatever color palette comes to your imagination. Ask your local hardware store if they can give you free paint swatches so you can decide which hues and colors you want."

        {
          "headline":"Look into fabrics.",
          "description":"Choose basic, solid color fabrics that you can use as a canvas for your creativity. A simple white duvet can be embellished with trims, fabric flowers, or if you have the talent, you can embroider on the white duvet or bed cover. If you want, skip using a duvet and create a quilt instead. It\u2019s traditionally used as a bed cover but since this is a project you are doing on your own, you are only limited to your own creativity."

          "headline":"Think about pillows.",
          "description":"Another vehicle to add a splash of color to your toddler\u2019s bed are his or her pillows. Go with colors that compliment whatever color you've chosen for the bed cover or the duvet. You can also go for pillows with white pillow covers and just add trimming and embellishments of your choice to the pillow covers to up the design factor."

        {
          "headline":"Select some complimentary decorations.",
          "description":"You can go with minimalist and contemporary designs, rustic and country styles or colorful and eclectic options. You can base the design on your toddler\u2019s temperament and character. For example, if she is bubbly and perky, then go with colorful and eclectic designs with splashes of color everywhere. If your toddler is contemplative, mild mannered and shy, you can go with a modern and contemporary or minimalist design where he or she can be most comfortable in. Some decorations include a bookcase, a study table, a lamp, some decorative hangings such as buntings and even pictures of your toddler or the whole family in frames."

You can use a HVLP (high volume low pressure) spray painter, as this is easier and less time consuming. You can check your local hardware store to see if they can rent a HVLP spray painter; most stores allow rental for around a hundred dollars."

Make sure to cover the floors and the nearby area with old newspapers and wear something that you won\u2019t mind getting dirty. If you have purchased a toddler bed that has a frame that has already been treated with lacquer or urethane, you will need to strip this down using a TSP or Tri Sodium Phosphate. TSP basically is just a chemical that \u201crinses off\u201d whatever chemical was applied initially to furniture.

Again, check with your local hardware if and how much they rent this out. Just make sure to ask help from a professional if you are hesitant about using the orbital sander. However, you can definitely sand down the bed frame by hand; it isn\u2019t as hard to do."

The idea is to not redistribute the fine dust all over the bed surface and all over the place. The next step is to apply your primer. This is an important part of your project because it gives the bed frame a nice even and professional looking finish. You can apply the primer as you would the paint. You can use roller, brush or the HVLP sprayer. Some of the best brands of primer in the market are Kilz and Zinsser. Both primers have a selection of low-odor types so you definitely want to use those."

No hard work necessary because you just need to re-sand lightly and smoothly. The goal is to make the surface as smooth to the touch as possible. Once more, after sanding, clean the surface using a vacuum or cloth with rubbing alcohol."

When using a paintbrush, use a 2\u201d paint brush for wide surfaces and a 1\u201d paint brush for narrow surfaces. Make sure that your strokes are even and paint along the direction of the grain. The same technique applies when using a roller. The trick to painting is sure, even and quick strokes. Avoid re-working over what you have already painted on especially if it has begun to dry."

If you want to go with graphic designs, do not overload the duvet with a lot of it because then, it would look disorganized and loud. Simple, one-theme graphic designs are best. If applying trims to the duvet, make sure that all trims are straight and aligned along the sides of the mattress (not the duvet itself) as you will want to create depth when applying these trims to the duvet. You can also use piping, lace, jewelry, cord, tassel trims or the more playful venice trims. Most of these trims need to be machine sewn or if you have the time, hand stitched to the fabric rather than applying them using fabric glue.

Most professional workers are able to score a discounted rate for some building and paint materials. However, with a little bit of effort you can find these same kind of \tmaterials in architectural salvage stores or reuse centers or even from your neighbor\u2019s garage \tsale. Decorating your toddler\u2019s bed won\u2019t be that pricey since it would mostly involve just re-painting \tthe bed frame with whatever color your toddler wants and there\u2019s a range of paint colors available in the market to choose from. You can hand paint or use HVLP (high volume; low \tpressure) sprayer. Tons of duvets, bed and pillow covers are also available on the market. There\u2019s an array of fabrics printed with \twell loved cartoon characters and fabrics in basic colors \tthat you can mix and match with other decors in your toddler\u2019s bedroom; and these come in \taffordable prices that can fit your budget. Figure out if there is any risk involved in the project. Generally, anything involving plumbing, lifting heavy loads, electrical and wiring should be done by a professional. It simply isn\u2019t worth your time, effort and money to try doing these things on your own, especially if you have zero knowledge on these skills. Painting a toddler\u2019s bed or any other furniture in your home can mostly be done outside in a well ventilated area or even inside, as long as you do it without the kids around and make the area is well ventilated as possible. Make sure that you have all of the necessary equipment. Paint, a simple paintbrush and a roller tray are basically all you need in vamping up your toddler\u2019s bed. If you want to use a HVLP sprayer, ask your local hardware store if they can rent out this equipment to you for a day or two. Sewing your toddler\u2019s duvet or bed cover is something that you can do, or you can choose to buy basic bed covers at the local home shopping store and decide later on if you want to embellish or decorate the covers more. Think about whether you have the necessary DIY skills to complete the project. The last thing you should consider is you. Do you have the time and patience see the job through? Can you make the necessary adjustments in your schedule to finish the job? What if it doesn\u2019t turn out the way you want it to? Do you have a back up plan? Can you follow directions and are you resourceful? These questions are here to help you evaluate your capacity to see a D.I.Y project through. If you answered positively to these questions then, by all means, decorate your toddler\u2019s bed on your own. It might be a bit daunting at first, but you might be surprised to find out that you may have the aptitude for D.I.Y.",
