  "text":" Choose a Room and Get Your Supplies Identify an area to house the ironing board and laundry supplies. You will be building a small, thin shelf to hold supplies and grab the ironing board. So you\u2019ll need not only an area to house the items, but enough space to allow the ironing board to comfortably be used. If your laundry room isn\u2019t feasible, consider a large closet or spare bedroom for your organizing system. Make sure you have room on one wall to mount a shelf that will hold your ironing board. Check the wall to ensure you can drive screws into it and that its sturdy enough to hold the supplies. Pick up lumber for shelves. You\u2019ll need a 10-ft. piece of 1x8 and a 2-ft. piece of 1x6. This will be used to create the shelves and overall structure. Purchase two hooks that will be mounted outside the shelf to hold the top of the ironing board. Look for a set that comes with its own pair of screws or mounting materials. Buy paint or stain (you\u2019ll want the organizer to at least look pretty), sandpaper and liquid nails glue. Big tools you\u2019ll need include a jigsaw, electric screwdriver, clamps, nail gun and safety equipment (glasses and gloves). Build the Organizer\\/Shelf Mark where you plan to cut your shelves. Use a pencil and tape measure to align the sides. Measure from the bottom 2 in., 14-3/4 in. and 27-1/2 in. to mark the bottom of the shelves. Add an optional touch by cutting a 1 x 1 dog ear at the bottom of the sides for decorative flair. Cut out the shelves, following your pencil guides. Carefully sand cut pieces to remove debris and smooth wood. Glue each side to the back of the shelf. This is where using clamps may come in handy. Clamp the system down after you have applied the glue. Add supportive nails (about three nails) to the glued area to ensure the system stays in place. Center and glue the top piece to the shelf. Proceed the same way as you did when gluing and nailing the sides--clamp the system down after you apply glue and then add nails. Consider leaving a 2-in. overhang on each side for decoration. Add paint or stain to finished shelf. Consider sanding and then removing the debris with a soft cloth before adding paint or stain. Mount Shelf and Use Drill pilot holes into the top face of each side piece before adding screws to the wall. Mount shelf on the wall by adding another screw or nail to the bottom section (so it cannot move). Add hooks to the front of each side panel. You will hang your ironing board from these hooks so make sure you allow for enough room for the board to hang evenly. Follow mounting instructions on the package. Place ironing/laundry supplies inside shelf and hang ironing board on the top hooks. ",
