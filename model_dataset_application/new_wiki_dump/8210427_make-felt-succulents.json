If you don't have hot glue, you can use fabric glue instead, but you may have to tape or clip the felt roll shut until the glue dries. Don't have any glue at home? Lightly stitch the roll shut using a needle and matching thread. Succulents are usually either a dark green or a light, green-grey, but you can make yours any color you want."

You can make the leaves rounded or pointed, depending on what you want your succulent to look like. Make the bottom of each leaf straight and flat instead of pointed. This will make them easier to attach. Plan on having about 12 big leaves and 6 small leaves for each stem that you make.

Start rolling from one of the long edges, and use a line of hot glue along the other long edge to secure the stem. Set the stem aside when you are done. Succulents are typically dark green or pale, green-grey, but you can make your succulents any color you want. Cut some 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) squares, then trim them down into leaf shapes. Keep the bottom of the each leaf straight. You can make the edges curved or straight, however. Glue your first leaf to the stem Draw a line of hot glue along the base of one leaf. Place the stem on top of it; make sure that it is centered and perpendicular to the leaf base (not parallel). The leaf should be about \u00bc to \u00bd-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) up the side of the stem. Glue your second leaf on top of the first one, sandwiching the stem in between. Take your second leaf, and draw a line of hot glue along the base. Place the leaf over the stem, making sure that the two leaves align. Run your finger along the base of the leaf to seal the glue. Open up the leaves. Once the glue has set, gently grip the two leaves by their points, and pull them down so that they are perpendicular to the stem. Glue down your next set of leaves about 1 inch (254 centimeters) above the first set, but have them face the opposite direction. Rotate your stem so that you see just the sides of your first set of leaves. They should be making a slight V-shape.

Pull them down so that they are perpendicular to the stem. Cut two mini leaves. These leaves should be shaped just like the others, but only \u00bc-inch (0.64-centimeter) tall and wide. Glue the mini leaves to the top of the stem, between the two larger leaves. Make sure that the mini leaves are pointing in the opposite direction as the ones just below it. Do not pull the mini leaves apart. Enhancing Your Succulents Consider dyeing your felt first. Most succulents aren't a bright green color craft felt typically comes in, but rather a soft, pale green.
