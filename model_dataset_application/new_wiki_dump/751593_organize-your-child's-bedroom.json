          "description":"Each article of clothing should have a distinct and separate space. Although it may be easier to simply store everything in the dresser, or everything in the closet, each different type of clothing should have its own place. Have your child try on their clothes so you can separate out items that don\u2019t fit for keepsakes or donation. Place coats, sweaters, dresses, and shoes in the closet. These items will typically be too bulky to fit into a dresser drawer. Place shorts, pants, and leggings in their own drawer, or their own section of a single drawer, setting aside a separate drawer or section for shirts. Do the same for pajamas, socks, and underwear. This way, when you need an article of clothing, you know exactly where to find it."

Some days, you might find a large number of toys or clothing items your child no longer needs or wants, and other days, you might not be able to find any. Look for toys covered in a thin layer of dust. If dust has enough time to accumulate, your child has likely lost interest in the toy. Similarly, look for clothing items that have remained folded and untouched through 2-3 weeks of laundry. These items are not being worn, and someone else may be able to benefit from them."
