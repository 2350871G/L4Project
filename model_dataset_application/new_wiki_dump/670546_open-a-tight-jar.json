Then, wrap your stronger hand around the lid and twist anti-clockwise as hard as you can. The increased grip from the rag should make twisting the lid off much easier."

Then, use your dominant hand to twist the jar anti-clockwise. Your hand will be able to grip onto the elastic band as you twist, making the jar easier to open. If one elastic band doesn't do the trick, you can wrap several around the lid for more stubborn jars."

Then, twist anti-clockwise as hard as you can. The plastic wrap will grip to the moisture in your hand. The more grip you have, the easier it is to twist a lid off a jar. Once you get the lid off, layer plastic wrap over the jar before putting the lid back on. This will make twisting the lid off much easier next time you need to."

The rubber gloves will give you more grip on the lid, making it easier to twist open."

Slowly rotate the lid around, letting the flame heat up the lid. This process shouldn't take more than a minute. If you see the lid start to bubble or drip, immediately remove it from the heat. This heat, much like the hot water, expands the molecules making it easier to open. Make sure to open the lid with a thick rag or gloves after heating it as you could accidentally burn yourself.
