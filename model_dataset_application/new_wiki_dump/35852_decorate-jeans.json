          "description":"Fabric markers draw like ordinary markers, but are made with permanent inks that are designed not to wash out. Fabric markers are likely to work best on white or light-colored denims, although some are designed to show up on darker fabrics. Try drawing or writing free-hand designs on your jeans. You may wish to sketch in your designs with pencil before going over them with fabric markers. You can use lace to create a delicate marker pattern on your jeans. Just pin the lace to the part of the jeans you\u2019d like to decorate, color over the part of the pattern you\u2019d like to transfer with a fabric marker, and remove the lace when you\u2019re done."

          "description":"You can use fabric paint to create your own designs. You may wish to lightly sketch in your design with pencil before starting to paint. Keep your painting surface completely flat and prevent bleed-through by inserting a piece of cardboard into the part of your jeans that you\u2019d like to decorate. Fabric paints come in a variety of textures and application types. Some come in tubes with applicator tips and are designed to be applied in a controlled line, while others are designed to be brushed or sprayed on. Keep in mind what sort of design you would like to do and select an appropriate paint for the job."

          "headline":"Use stencils to add designs with fabric paint or markers.",
          "description":"You can purchase stencils to use or make your own. Stenciling usually works best with fabric paint that can be brushed on or applied as a spray. If you are using spray paint, make sure to protect the area around the stencil with a sheet of cloth or plastic so that you don\u2019t get paint where you don\u2019t want it. For brush-on paint, try using a foam brush with a small amount of paint on it so that your stencil designs don\u2019t become runny or smudged."

Focus on pockets, cuffs, or the fronts of the thighs. If you wish to add any embellishments to the back of your jeans, take care not to position them in a way that will make sitting uncomfortable. For example, some flat sequins or gems on your back pockets are probably fine, but raised embellishments on the backs of your thighs might create discomfort."

If you prefer, you can use a bedazzler to mechanically add studs and gems to your jeans. Add your studs in a pattern, focus on a pocket, or place them around hems or along seams. You may wish to mark in the desired placement of your studs with a pencil or marker before you start studding."

Use a sewing machine or sew on your patches by hand. Sew on several patches at various locations for a classic patchwork look. Try using the patch material over one or both of your back pockets.
