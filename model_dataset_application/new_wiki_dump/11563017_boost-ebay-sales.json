          "description":"eBay has a built-in sales report tool so you can measure how well your products sell and find listings that haven\u2019t been doing well. Go to your eBay account and select the Sales Report option from the subscription menu. Check for products that are still unsold so you know which listings aren\u2019t selling in your shop and need improvement. You must have made a successful sale within the last 4 months to access the sales report option. You must view your sales reports once every 60 days, or else you will have to opt back into the program."

          "headline":"Opt for popular items that will sell through quickly.",
          "description":"While you can try to sell random and unique items on eBay, they may not sell as well as popular products, such as phones, clothing, and home decor. When you\u2019re searching for products to list on your shop, look for items that have a high demand so you can sell them quickly. Try to find products that are rare or unique within their market, such as limited-edition items or promotional items, since they tend to sell for more money. You will have more competition trying to sell items in popular categories. If you sell handmade items, look at trends that are happening online or in design magazines."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Check the sell-through percentage of items with an online trend tool.",
          "description":"Online trend tools allow you to search for products so you can see your competitors, the prices items sold for, and the amount of time it took for them to sell. Type in the name of the product that you want to sell, and scroll through the results that pop up so you can see the information. If the product has a sell-through percentage above 50\u201360%, it will usually sell within about 2 weeks. Some services that you can try include Terapeak, Vendavo, and KBMax. If you have an official eBay store, you may have access to trend tools with your account. Check the services offered with your eBay account to determine what\u2019s available."

          "headline":"Bundle related items together to make more of a profit.",
          "description":"Bundling allows you to make more money off of your sales without trying to find multiple customers. Think about common items that you would want or need with the products you\u2019re listing on your store. Combine items that work well together into a single listing so you can charge more and seem like you\u2019re offering a better deal than your competitors. For example, you could bundle cases or accessories if you\u2019re selling a cell phone. As another example, you can add controllers or games if you\u2019re selling a video game console.Tip: Offer freebies with your products as a promotion to help your eBay store get more traffic. While it may not boost your profits, you could sell more products and boost your visibility in other searches."

          "description":"Be sure to include the name of the brand and product right in the title so it shows up in searches right away. Specify any details that make your product unique, such as the year it was made, the condition it\u2019s in, and the available size. If you don\u2019t know what keywords to include, try searching for the product on eBay to see how other sellers are listing the information. For example, rather than writing, \u201cMadden 2019 Game\u201d as a title, you may instead specify, \u201cMadden 2019 Game for Xbox One, New in Shrink Wrap in Box.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re selling a pair of jeans, your listing may look like, \u201cAmerican Eagle Women\u2019s Skinny Jeans, Size 2 Regular, Light Blue.\u201d\nCheck the spelling of your listing title since they may not show up in searches if there\u2019s a misspelling."

Break your sentences into bullet points so it\u2019s easier for your customers to scroll through the listing and find what they\u2019re looking for. Avoid using a lot of special formatting, such as colored or bold text, since they can look distracting and hard to read. Mention positive customer feedback you\u2019ve had in the past if you have any. You can either quote positive reviews directly or mention that you have many happy customers so buyers check your feedback rating. Some categories on eBay, such as electronics, sporting goods, and baby supplies, require product identifiers like the brand, product IDs, and manufacture dates if you\u2019re listing them new or refurbished."

          "description":"Look up the product you\u2019re listing through the eBay search and sort the list by items that have sold. Pay attention to the prices that the items have sold for in the past and how long it took them to sell. Set your prices about the same as the lowest one from your competitors so buyers are more likely to see your product, but you\u2019re still able to make a profit. For example, if a pair of shoes recently sold for $120 USD, you could set the price for the same pair at $120 as well. Keep in mind how much your expenses cost and charge enough for your item to make a profit. You can also use the \u201cPrice it for Me\u201d tool on eBay, which automatically compares similar products, but it may not be as reliable as setting the price yourself. Look up prices on other websites as well to see how much they\u2019re charging. For example, look at similar items on Etsy if you sell craft products.Warning: Don\u2019t base your list prices off of other sellers\u2019 asking prices since they may not have done research and they may be over- or underselling."

Look for the Category option of your listing and select the one that\u2019s most applicable to your item. There may be additional subcategories to choose from once you select the first one, so be sure to specify what it fits into the best. For example, if you\u2019re selling a sundress, the category it would best fit into is Clothing, Shoes, and Accessories. There may be multiple categories that your product fits into. Try searching for the product on eBay to see what category other people are listing it under. For example, put stuffed animals in the Dolls & Bears category instead of Toys & Hobbies."

Use your phone or digital camera to take pictures from multiple angles so buyers can see the product. Make sure to photograph any details or damage that you specified in the listing so the buyer isn\u2019t surprised when they receive their product. You can upload up to 12 pictures per listing, so choose the best photos you\u2019ve taken. Don\u2019t use stock images that you found online since it could make your listing seem like a scam."

When you make your listing, select the box under Promoted Listings and select the percentage that you\u2019re willing to give to eBay. Once you set the percentage, your listing will feature more prominently in searches and your products will get more views. The higher percentage that you allow eBay to take from the sale, the more traffic your item will receive. The average percentage that eBay takes varies between categories, but it\u2019s usually between 3\u201310%.

You may also pay to run promotions through social media to reach audiences that are outside of your friend group. Include a link in your promotion and write a short description of what you\u2019re selling. Publish the promotion when you\u2019re finished so more potential buyers look at your products. You may not reach as wide of an audience promoting on social media. Be careful not to promote too much on social media since people may think it\u2019s spam and ignore the posts."

Check the return policy you have on your profile and extend it to 30 or 60 days if it\u2019s not there already. That way, buyers will feel like they have an ample amount of time to try the product to see if they like it. While some buyers may take advantage of the return policy, many people will forget about it and won\u2019t think to return the item.
