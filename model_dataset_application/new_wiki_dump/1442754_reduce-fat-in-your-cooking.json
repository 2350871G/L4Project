          "headline":"Roast or broil meat and vegetables to get rich flavor that's low in fat.",
          "description":"Start by trimming the meat of visible fat and place it in a roasting dish with vegetables. If you're making a large piece of meat, cook it at low heat for a long time so the meat tenderizes. To cook thinner cuts of meat or vegetables, place them on a sheet about 3 inches (7.6 cm) below a broiler and broil them until they're as cooked as you like. Keep in mind that thin cuts of lean meat should usually be cooked quickly so they don't become tough."

        {
          "headline":"Grill lean meats and vegetables to add a smoky flavor.",
          "description":"Grilling is a great low-fat technique since any fat from the food will drip through the grates instead of being reabsorbed by the food. You can also add a handful of woodchips to the grill to enhance the flavor of the smoke. To make it easier to grill vegetables, place them in a grill basket which you can set directly on the grates."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Stir-fry to quickly make a low-fat meal.",
          "description":"Skip the batter and slice lean meat or vegetables into thin strips while you heat a skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Spritz a little cooking spray into the pan and add the prepped food. Keep stirring as the food cooks so it heats evenly and doesn't stick. This is a great way to get caramelized flavor without adding a lot of fat. If the food starts to stick to the pan, add a few spoonfuls of water or vegetable stock."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Steam meat and veggies to create tenderness without the fat.",
          "description":"Instead of cooking meat and vegetables in fat, such as butter or oil, cook it in water! Heat about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water in a pot until it starts simmering and producing steam. Then, put your food into a steamer basket and set it into the pot. Put the lid on and steam the food until it's tender and cooked throughout.Variation: If you don't have a steamer basket, heat 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 44 ml) of water in a covered skillet. Once it starts to steam, add the food so it's in a single layer. Then, put the lid on and steam the food until it's tender. The bottom of the steamer basket shouldn't be touching the water or the food will boil instead of steam."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Avoid deep-frying or pan-frying foods.",
          "description":"Foods that are battered or fried in oil and grease are high in saturated fat. This is because the food absorbs some of the fat as it fries. Instead of using these methods to get crispy foods, try coating foods, such as chicken pieces or fish, in panko breadcrumbs or crushed cornflakes before baking them. If you choose to stir-fry foods instead of deep-frying them, you can add extra crunch by sprinkling some toasted nuts over the food just before serving."

          "description":"Limit the amount of saturated fat you cook with, but recognize that your body does need nutritious forms of monosaturated fat, such as canola oil, olive oil, safflower oil, and sunflower oil. For example, instead of spreading margarine or butter on your baked goods, drizzle a little extra-virgin olive oil. Avoid eating foods made with hydrogenated oils and trans fats. These will raise your bad cholesterol while lowering good cholesterol."

Try substituting puree, such as applesauce, pear sauce, or canned pumpkin, for all of the butter or oil in cakes, muffins, and quick bread. Applesauce is a great fat replacer in cake, muffins, and cookies. Try shredding zucchini to use in brownies or chocolate cake."

          "description":"You can use low-fat, nonfat, or Greek yogurt in most recipes that call for sour cream or mayonnaise. If you're not ready to give up sour cream yet, try switching to a reduced-fat version. Yogurt even works as a substitute for mayonnaise in cold salad recipes, such as tuna or chicken salad. You could also try low-fat ricotta instead of full-fat sour cream."

If you don't want to compromise flavor, you could use reduced-fat versions of these cheeses. You should also try to reduce the amount of cheese you use when you cook. For example, save it for a garnish instead of adding it to a sauce."

Incorporate other forms of protein, such as seafood, beans, or tofu, that are lower in fat, for instance.Tip: Canadian bacon is a great low-fat substitute for bacon or pepperoni. For example, instead of making chili with ground beef, you could use ground turkey breast or use half of the recommended amount of ground beef with black beans."

Keep healthy choices, such as chopped fruit, vegetable sticks, plain pretzels, or unbuttered popcorn. If you like to snack on nuts, limit yourself to a small handful since these are naturally high in fat."

You'll probably find that you use less than if you poured the dressing or sauce over your food. To make lower-fat choices, pick vinaigrettes instead of very sweet or creamy dressings.
