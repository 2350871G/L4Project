The quills are designed to stick into things and stay there, and as soon as the porcupine knows they are stuck in something, it will eject them from its skin and run away. Also, they cannot shoot quills--only let them go from their skin once they have stuck into something. First, sneak up on the porcupine until you're right behind it and it doesn't notice you. (Or get within accurate cushion-throwing distance, but be careful, you only have one shot per animal.) Then, slowly pull back your arms and suddenly throw the cushion or blanket down onto the unsuspecting porcupine. Making sure you are wearing gloves, pick up the soft object (after you are sure the quills were released) and observe the stuck quills! Pick these out and safely put them into a plastic box in your backpack. Be careful-- they are sharp!"

This returns its nutrients to the environment. If you're interested in eating the porcupine (not a common food, but it is edible), skin the animal and bag up the skin. Dress the animal and place the meat in the remaining two bags--like with the skin but only two. Discard the leftovers into the woods for scavengers. Take the quills out of the skin at home as described above, and put the meat in the freezer while you do this--and only do it before you cook the meat; the skin will spoil so you must do it now."
