This is an effective method for smooth guacamole, which can keep green in the fridge for 24\u201372 hours. Before eating, pour the water out slowly while holding back the guacamole with a spoon. Stir before serving to mix in the last few drops of water. This may be unpleasant in chunky guacamole, made with avocado slices instead of mashed avocado. One test with whole avocados failed within four hours. The more mashed and stirred your guac is, the better this will go."

Most experts agree that this only protects the guacamole directly under the pit, by blocking the air. Any food-safe object could be used for the same purpose \u2014 but the pit is conveniently at hand."
