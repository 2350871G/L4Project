          "description":"You might need to trade the crib for a toddler bed when your child is as young as 12 months old. Generally, your child will be ready for a bed when they are 18 months old or older. You\u2019ll know when your child is ready for a toddler bed when you hear or see them climbing out of their own crib. If your crib has the option of converting into a bed \u2013 for instance, by lowering one side of the crib rails \u2013 you won\u2019t need to invest in a separate bed. Simply follow manufacturer instructions and remove the toddler rail. Before changing your convertible crib into a bed, make sure that your particular model meets current safety standards and has not been recalled. In the U.S., you can do this by checking the Consumer Product Safety Commission website at https://cpsc.gov/. If you don\u2019t have a convertible crib, you\u2019ll need to invest in a toddler bed. Unlike cribs, toddler beds are small and low to the ground, allowing your child to get in and out of bed on their own. A toddler bed is acceptable until your child is about 4 or 5 years of age. If you have other, younger children, you can keep the toddler bed and pass it on to them when your toddler outgrows it."

          "description":"Toddler beds, like normal beds, require sheets, pillows, and blankets. You can obtain these items online or in many home and bedroom stores. Take your child with you to the home good store and allow them to select a set of sheets they like. Your child might be interested in sheets that are blue, yellow, or multicolored. Sheets with popular animated characters might also be of interest to your child. Direct your child to various sheet and comforter sets to help them make a decision that will get them excited about their room and their bedtime. Add some small stuffed animals to your child\u2019s bed. You could give your child a personalized pillow with their name on it. Ensure your toddler bedding is made of soft, nontoxic, non-flammable material. Check the bedding\u2019s packaging to determine if it is or is not made of appropriate materials."

Some toddlers like rugs that are shaped like an animal \u2013 for instance, a zebra rug or a bear rug. But these rugs might scare some toddlers. Take your toddler to the store and ask them if they would like a particular rug before making your purchase."

For instance, your child might enjoy an image of a happy monkey or similar beast. Other toddler rooms have walls covered in brightly colored abstract art. You can also paint directly onto the walls. For instance, some people like to paint trees or birds onto their walls. Some toddler rooms feature more classically-inspired murals that excite the eye. Try hanging some family photos on the wall of your toddler room. Make sure the frames are securely mounted well out of your toddler\u2019s reach. Select frames that use shatter-proof acrylic glass, or remove the glass altogether. Make sure that all decorative items are made with non-toxic materials and free of small decor that can easily break off. Avoid alphabet charts and similar decorations that are geared towards babies. In the past, many people chose pink walls if their child was a girl and blue walls if their child was a boy. However, this is no longer preferred."

Swap it with a storage basket for toys and games. Remove chairs and swings that you used in the nursery, as well as toys or objects that your toddler is no longer interested in. Add a beanbag chair or a soft child\u2019s chair to the toddler room. Draw a plan showing where you\u2019d like everything to go before you start rearranging your toddler\u2019s room."
