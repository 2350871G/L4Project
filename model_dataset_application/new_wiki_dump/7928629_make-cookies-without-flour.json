To replace flour as a binding agent, replace flour in your recipe with chopped nuts (like pecans, macadamia nuts, or walnuts) or rolled oats. These will bind your other ingredients together and help the cookies hold their shape as they bake. Try a no-bake chocolate oatmeal cookie or traditional flourless almond cookies. You could also try baking cookies using a ground nut flour or wheat germ."

Meringues and macarons are good examples of flourless cookies that rely on egg whites for body. You could also make mini-Pavlova cookies that are like little meringues. Fill these with fruit, nuts, or chocolate for a simple flourless dessert."

Carefully chop the chocolate and nuts until they're the size of chocolate chips. Set these ingredients aside. You could use a food processor to chop the nuts and chocolate, if you don't want to chop them by hand. Just ensure not to chop the nuts and chocolate into a fine powder."

It's helpful to let the egg white fall into one bowl so you can place the egg yolk in the other bowl. Do this for every egg. Since you'll only need the egg whites, you can cover and refrigerate the egg yolks for another recipe (like lemon curd, creme brulee or a custard)."

The dry ingredients will dissolve in the egg whites to create a dark thick cookie dough. Stir in the chopped nuts and chocolate. You can use a rubber spatula to stir in the chopped nuts and chocolate if the dough gets too thick. Check the bottom of the mixing bowl to ensure there isn't any flour or cocoa that hasn't been stirred in."

Leave 3 inches of space between each cookie since they'll spread as they cook. Bake the cookies for 25 minutes. They'll become crisp and crackly on the outside when they're done.

The bowl and beaters need to be completely clean and free of grease. Check the egg whites to ensure that no yolk is in the bowl. These can prevent the egg whites from beating to full volume.
