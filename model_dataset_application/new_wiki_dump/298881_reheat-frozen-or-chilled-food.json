Stir regularly as the food heats up. Depending on how much food you have, reheating could take about 20 minutes. Ideal foods to reheat in this way include soups, stews, liquids, beverages, and chili. For beverages, avoid adding additional water."

Cook for about five minutes, and then use a spatula to flip the food. Cook for another five minutes, or until it\u2019s heated through. This method is ideal for noodles, pasta, rice, or other grains. You can also use this method with beans. Frying in a bit of oil will make the noodles or rice slightly crispy."

The water will add moisture back to the grains, and will bring the grains back to their original consistency. Pour the grains into a pot with \u00bd cup (118 ml) of water or broth.
