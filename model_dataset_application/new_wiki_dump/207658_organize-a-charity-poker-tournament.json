      "headline":"When people arrive on the day of the tournament, give them their chips and start the games.",
      "description":"Everybody should begin with the same amount of chips. People will play until they run out of chips, and then they can either buy back in (paying more money for a fresh stack of chips) or quit. As play continues, players will bust out and choose to leave. When you are playing multiple tables, it is unfair to have a large disparity in the number of players at each table. During play, the tournament director should re-seat players at different tables to keep a reasonable balance. If at a three table tourney where 10 players start on each, a particular table experiences a rash of bust outs and is left with 7 players while the other two lose only one between them. Players at the table of 7 are playing 30% more hands in the blinds, which causes irritation to the players. Refer to Reseat Players in Poker Tournements."
