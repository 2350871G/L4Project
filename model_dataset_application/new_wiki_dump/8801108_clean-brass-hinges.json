          "description":"There are two kinds of brass hinges: solid brass hinges, and hinges made of brass-plated steel, zinc, or cast iron. Place a magnet next to the brass hinge you\u2019re interested in cleaning. If it sticks, you\u2019ll know it is not made of solid brass. If the brass hinge you\u2019re interested in cleaning is made of brass-plated zinc, cast iron, or steel, clean it very gently or the brass coating might come off."

          "description":"Mix hot water with a few drops of liquid dish soap. There is no need to measure the volume of soap or water \u2013 just get the solution sudsy. Dip a warm sponge or cloth in the water and wipe the hinge down. After you\u2019ve given it a thorough once-over, dip an old toothbrush in the water and clean any crevices or hard-to-reach places that you weren\u2019t able to wipe down during your first cleaning."

          "description":"If your brass-plated hinges are unlacquered, you could wipe the hinge with an old toothbrush or rag dipped in ammonia if soapy water doesn\u2019t do the trick. Rinse the hinges off in your sink beneath swiftly-flowing water. Dry with a clean, soft cloth. Do not use this method if your hinges are lacquered, as you will damage the coating. To determine if your brass-plated hinges are lacquered, conduct a visual inspection. The lacquer forms a thin, clear shell over the brass-plated hinge. Brass plate is almost always lacquered."

Popular brass cleaning products include Wright\u2019s Premium Brass Cleaning Polish and Brasso Multipurpose Polish.

Place the hinges in the pot, bring it to a boil, then turn the heat to its lowest setting. The amount of time it takes to get your brass hinges clean by simmering them in milk depends on the extent of grime and tarnish the hinges have acquired. Use tongs to pull the hinges out every 10 minutes  and examine them. If they\u2019re clean, turn the stovetop off and rinse your hinges in water. If the hinges are not clean, drop them back in their milk bath."

If, after another dip in the crockpot, the paint is still not coming off or has only partially come off, rub a cloth dampened with mineral spirits over the entire surface of the hinge.
