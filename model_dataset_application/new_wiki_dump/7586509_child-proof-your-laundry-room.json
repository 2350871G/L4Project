For childproofing purposes, keep as many cords, pipes, tubes, and connections out of sight or out of reach as possible. A washing machine should be connected directly to a standard 110 volt outlet (in the U.S.), while a dryer should be plugged into a dedicated 220 volt line. Make sure all connections are secure and out of reach of children. If necessary, use childproofing outlet covers that prevent access to the plugged-in connection.
