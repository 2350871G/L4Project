Any camera that is capable of long exposure of at least five seconds is okay to use. A film camera, digital camera, or even your smartphone will work."

An exposure range from 5 to 40 seconds is best if you are using a camera with a manual exposure setting. A longer setting than that may cause the photo to come out blurry. ISO (International Standards Organization) determines the sensitivity of the sensor in your camera. This affects the exposure of your photos."

An interesting foreground will fill up the negative space left by the small size of the moon in your photo. Consider a cityscape. The shape of the skyline will provide an interesting foreground for your photo. Go out into nature. A clear sky and natural landscape is a sure way to have an interesting foreground. Go to the mountains or a forest for a sure way to fill the foreground in your photo."

Try estimating the moon\u2019s direction and elevation one or two night before the eclipse. The moon will appear in the same position 50 minutes later each night.
