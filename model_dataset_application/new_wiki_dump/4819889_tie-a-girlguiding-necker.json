Ask them to hold down the point furthest away from you. Alternatively, use something such as a paperweight or heavy book. Begin rolling. Roll the necker from the middle and stop 3\u20134 inches (7.6\u201310.2 cm) from the end. Shake the necker. Take hold of the necker in the middle and shake it about three times, as this will neaten out the rolling. Tying the necker Place the necker around your neck. Ensure the necker is still rolled at this point. This will create two strands. Fold the left hand strand in half. To do this, take the left hand strand and fold it back on itself, towards you. Take the right hand strand and cross it over. The right hand strand should then be crossed over the folded back left strand. Fold the right hand strand underneath the left hand strand. Do not bring the strand all the way around, just underneath. Fold the left hand strand diagonally over the right hand strand.
