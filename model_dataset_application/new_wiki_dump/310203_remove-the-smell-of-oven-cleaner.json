          "description":"On top of smelling like grandma\u2019s house and the holidays, the smell of vanilla can also act as a great mask for other odors. After you\u2019ve cleaned your oven, there are two ways you can use vanilla to make it smell more pleasant:\nFill a small bowl with water and add one teaspoon (six ml) of vanilla extract or 10 drops of vanilla essential oil. Dip a cloth into the bowl and wring out the excess water. With the damp cloth, wipe down the insides of the oven, including the walls, bottom, roof, and the racks. Dip the cloth into the water often, and go over the entire oven a few times to spread the vanilla smell. Instead of wiping the oven down with vanilla, you can also bake the vanilla to get the smell into the appliance. Preheat the oven to 250 F (121 C). Fill a small baking dish with an inch (2.5 cm) of water and add in one teaspoon (six ml) of vanilla extract. Place the bowl in the oven and let it heat up for about an hour. Check on it every 15 minutes or so, and add more water as needed if there's a lot of evaporation going on."

          "description":"Lemons are another miracle odor killer, and they\u2019ll leave your kitchen smelling summer fresh and yummy. Not only that, but citrus itself is a great cleaner, so lemons will help loosen any leftover grease and buildup in your oven as well. Preheat the oven to 250 F (121 C). Cut two lemons in half and squeeze most of the juice into a baking dish. Add an inch (2.5 cm) of water, and place the lemon halves into the dish as well. When the oven is hot, place the dish on the rack and allow it to heat up for 30 minutes to an hour."

The citrus in the orange has a similar cleaning power to lemons, and it will also make your house smell fresh and clean. Preheat your oven to 250 F (121 C). Peel an orange with your fingers or a knife and set the flesh aside for eating or juicing. Place the peels on a baking sheet and bake them for 30 minutes to an hour. After an hour, turn off the oven and open the oven door slightly to allow the citrus smell to escape. You can use any citrus for this, or a combination, such as lemons, limes, and grapefruits. If you don't have any citrus fruits, you can also pour 1 cup (240 mL) of white vinegar into an oven-safe bowl and put it in the oven for 20 minutes at the lowest temperature setting to get rid of the oven cleaner smell."
