The company may boast their olive oil is from Italy, but the oil may only have been packaged in Italy.

Olive oil only lasts for two years, and that's assuming it's stored in perfect conditions. Even when stored properly, the flavor diminishes with time. The older the harvest date, the less taste the olive oil will have. If a bottle does not have a harvest date listed, put it back. Never purchase olive oil without knowing the harvest date."

          "description":"A seal of approval from at least some kind of olive oil organization should appear somewhere on the label. California-based olive oils, for example, should have a seal of approval from the California Olive Oil Council. This increases the chances the oil is quality. Olive oil that comes with a seal of approval also tends to be more upfront and honest about factors like harvest date. The seal of approval is usually found on the back of a bottle of olive oil."

Low levels of FFAs do not necessarily mean olive oil is high quality, but high levels indicate a poor quality oil. Look for oils with free fatty acids less than 10 meq/kg. Free fatty acid levels should be listed on an oil's ingredients label. Avoid purchasing oils that do not list fatty acid levels."

          "description":"Polyphenol contributes to the amount of heart-healthy antioxidants in olive oil. In general, a higher polyphenol content indicates a healthier olive oil. A polyphenol content below 300 is considered low and one above 500 is considered high. One downside to a higher polyphenol content, however, is the taste. Some polyphenol contents are over 800, which can make olive oil a little more bitter."

          "description":"If you're looking for an oil to drizzle over breads, cheeses, or meats, go for extra virgin varieties. Extra virgin olive oil is best served unheated and will therefore be very flavorful when used as a condiment. When using olive oil as a salad dressing or for mild foods like mozzarella, go for a mild or medium strength oil. Heartier foods or more flavorful vegetables like tomatoes pair well with a more robust oil."

Therefore, there is little point splurging on an expensive, flavorful cooking oil. Go for a slightly lower priced oil. It will probably not taste as good as pricier brands, but taste is less important with cooking oils. Extra virgin olive oil tolerates heat best, so opt for cheat brands of extra virgin olive oil for cooking."

          "description":"Many people assume filtered oil is higher quality, but this is not necessarily always the case. It depends more on how quickly you intend to use the oil. Unfiltered oils sometimes have a stronger taste, but you need to use them quickly as they spoil much faster than filtered varieties. In general, go for filtered oil if you need olive oil with a long shelf life and opt for unfiltered varieties if you plan to use the oil right away."

          "headline":"Choose the taste you want.",
          "description":"Different brands and types of oils have different tastes. Make sure to account for taste when selecting your oil and pick an oil that corresponds to your desired taste. Extra virgin brands of Colavita tend to have a very complex taste. For a more neutral taste, go for Bertolli extra virgin. Think about other factors, such as the oils spiciness, grassiness, fruitiness, and so on. It may be difficult to assess this at a grocery store. If you need a very specific flavor, shop at a farmer's market. Those selling olive oil will generally be able to give you a good overview of their product's flavor."
