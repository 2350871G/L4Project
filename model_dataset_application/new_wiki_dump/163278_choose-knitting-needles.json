Many knitters enjoy using metal needles because you can work quickly with them and because of the clicking sound they make while you are using them. However, if you are not concerned with knitting speed and/or find the clicking sound annoying, then metal needles might not be the best option for you. Most metal needles are made of aluminum, but you can also find metal needles that are made from nickel or brass."

You can also find plastic needles in extra-large sizes that other needles are not available in, so these may be a good option for knitting projects that require using a super bulky yarn or uncommon materials. Keep in mind that the yarn will easily slide off of plastic needles while you are working with it, which can be a bonus for speed knitting, or frustrating if you drop a stitch!"

Circular needles come in many different sizes and with different lengths of wire or nylon cord extending between the needles.

Double pointed needles are also great for smaller circular projects, such as socks and mittens. You can get double pointed needles in many different sizes. Double pointed needles come in sets of four or five needles. You may want to get a set of needle point covers if you plan to use double pointed needles. Stitches can easily slip off the ends of double pointed needles, especially if you are using metal or plastic ones. Place a needle point cover over one end or both ends of the needles while you work to avoid dropping a stitch."

You can attach different lengths of wire between circular needles or use extenders to make longer straight needles as needed. Keep in mind that these sets can be expensive, but it may be less expensive than buying all of the different needle types and sizes that you might use."
