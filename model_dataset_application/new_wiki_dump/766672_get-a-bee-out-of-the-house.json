          "description":"A clear bowl or cup is preferable, though not necessary. A plastic cup or bowl is also preferable, since its lower mass will reduce the risk of damaging your wall or window during the trapping process. You can use any regular cup or bowl you might have around your house. While a bowl allows for a wider margin of error when trapping the bee, the cup is easier to keep covered and move out once the bee has been trapped."

          "headline":"Wear a long-sleeved shirt and pants.",
          "description":"Long-sleeved shirts and pants provide maximum coverage over your body, making it less likely for you to be stung. Do not wear shorts or T-shirts when trapping a bee in a container."

          "headline":"Trap the bee within your cup or bowl.",
          "description":"When the bee has landed on a flat, smooth surface, slow bring the container of your choice toward the bee with one hand. When you\u2019re within six to twelve inches of the bee, rapidly bring the container over the bee, trapping it within. Do not attempt to trap a bee which is on the carpet. The chances it will escape are too great."

          "headline":"Choose a cover for your container.",
          "description":"You can use a wide variety of materials to cover the container which you have trapped the bee beneath. When trapping bees with a bowl, you could use a folded newspaper, a full sheet of thick paper, or a manila envelope. When trapping bees within a cup, you could use a notecard or magazine. Think about the radius of your cup or bowl\u2019s open end and choose a cover which corresponds appropriately. Whatever you choose, it should be relatively thin."

          "headline":"Place the cover between the bee and the surface it landed on.",
          "description":"After choosing your cover, slip it slowly between the lip of the bowl or glass you trapped the bee under and the wall or hard surface on which the bee was sitting. Starting at one edge of the container, ease it up by about one or two millimeters. Slip your magazine or notecard beneath the container and continue to push it across the surface the bee was sitting on. The bee will likely be surprised and fly about after having the container placed over it; this will make the process of easing the cover over your container that much easier."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Take the bee outside.",
          "description":"With the cover safely over the container you've captured the bee in, move to an open door. Take the bee about ten paces from your home and remove the paper holding the bee in the cup or bowl you've trapped it in. Place the mouth of the cup or bowl on the ground, then slide the cover off. Ensure that it flies or crawls out and run quickly back to your home, closing the door firmly behind you before the bee can find its way back in. Don't take the bee too far away. Its hive is likely nearby and without access to it, it will surely die."
