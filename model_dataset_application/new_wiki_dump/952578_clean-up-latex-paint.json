      "description":"Removing paint from CARPET is easily removed when paint is still wet with a stain remover. Spot Shot is a recommended brand of stain remover. Using a white rag, scrub off paint. Clean with water then repeat the steps with the stain remover. Depending on the spill this could take repeating several times until desired results are reached. If the paint is dried however, use Goof Off first to work loose and soften the paint then proceed with the stain remover."
