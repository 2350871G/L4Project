You can choose Serif, Merrilee, Grimm, or Alessa. Serif is a sprightly lightning-element warrior. He possesses high defense and can damage a single target. This is a very good starter Eidolon for players who need a tank to protect them. Merrilee is an ice-element sylph. She uses magic and is a range-support type. Most Wizards and Sorcerers go for Merrilee because of her ability to cast a magical shield that regenerates the health of party members. Grimm is a fire-type Eidolon and quite favorable in Infernal Abyss since the monsters in this dungeon are weak against fire elements. Grimm is mostly partnered with tanks such as Guardians and Berserkers because of his devastating damage and AoE skills. Alessa is a young unicorn and a master of the element of light. This Eidolon has a high evasion rate and possesses skills for both single and AoE. She's also equipped with a skill that can damage an enemy continuously."
