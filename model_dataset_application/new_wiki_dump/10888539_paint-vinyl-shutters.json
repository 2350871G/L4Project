          "description":"If your shutters have been around for a few years, chances are they will need to be thoroughly cleaned. Kill the mildew or mold using a mixture that is one-part bleach and four-parts water. Put that mixture in a garden sprayer or a spray bottle and apply to the shutters. Rinse thoroughly with a hose to remove any excess bleach. Keep the surface wet long enough for the bleach to do its job. This means you should wait a few minutes before rinsing the shutters. Make sure to protect your eyes and skin as well as any plants when you\u2019re working with bleach. A long-handle scrub brush can help work the solution into hard-to-reach corners. You can use the brush to scrub the entire surface of the shutter as well."

Laundry detergent and water is an effective way to cleanse your shutters. This is also a good time to scrape or sand away any loose or peeling paint.

If you are giving the shutter its first coat of paint, it is recommended you apply primer first. Using primer before painting allows better coverage for the top coat, giving the shutter a nice, polished look at the end."

Once the coat is dry, the paint is flexible enough to expand and contract as the temperature changes. This helps the paint prevent peeling and flaking.
