This is especially true if the teabags come in a tin or other container that is relatively airtight.

If possible, choose an opaque container, such as a metal tin, so that the tea won't be exposed to light. Clear containers are fine if you plan to store the tea in a completely dark area.

For this reason it\u2019s best to keep different teas in separate airtight containers. For example, put green tea bags and Earl Grey teabags in separate containers. Otherwise, the delicate green tea may end up tasting more like Earl Grey. Never mix different kinds of loose leaf tea together in the same container."

It's also a good idea to write the expiration date on the container, which you can find on the tea's original packaging. Opening storage containers repeatedly exposes the tea to oxygen, which will degrade the quality. Clear containers can be useful, since you'll be able to see inside without opening them.

It's best to go with a climate controlled storage area that has air conditioning, if possible. For example, if your cupboard is near the oven or your laundry room, it will probably get too warm for tea storage.

Lots of areas that seem safe in the kitchen might actually be too humid for tea storage. For example, don't store your tea near an oven or stove, since those areas tend to get humid. Avoid counters near the sink, where dishwater splashes, and under the sink, which tends to be damp. Many basements are dark and cool, but they may be too moist for tea storage."

For example, don't store your tea near a spice rack or close to pungent smelling foods like garlic and onions."

However, some people feel that cold storage is the best way to maintain the flavor of delicate teas, like green and white tea. If you want to store tea in the freezer, be sure to secure it inside several airtight layers first. For instance, you can put the tea in a sealable plastic freezer bag and then put the bag in an airtight jar or tin. If you have a vacuum sealer, use that to seal your tea before putting it in the freezer."
