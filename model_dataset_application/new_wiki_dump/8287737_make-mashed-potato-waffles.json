Add 1/4 cup (60 ml) of the reserved water from the potatoes and keep mashing until the potatoes are smooth and almost runny. Taste the mashed potatoes and add salt and pepper to your liking. You want the mashed potatoes to be thinner than you'd usually serve on their own. This is because you'll be mixing in flour and eggs which will thicken the mashed potatoes."
