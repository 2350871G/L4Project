Although you can technically convert FPM to cubic feet per minute (CFM), it\u2019s much easier to use an anemometer that will do this for you. You can typically an anemometer online or at most home improvement stores. To convert FPM to CFM, multiple the FPM by pi times the radius of the duct squared. You can also use an online converter tool to convert FPM to CFM."
