The best day to have a party is a friday, so before the party starts, if your friends aren't coming, they can drop off their stuffed animals before home time so you can walk home with your stuffed animals and their friends."

If your parents don't allow your friends to come over, tell them to drop their stuffed animal off at your house. Offer to pick your stuffed animal's buddies up and if you use the car, then buckle ALL their friends in. Ask them if their stuffed animal can stay for a sleepover, and let them get their PJs."
