Break up the meat as it cooks with a spoon or spatula. You want the meat to cook until it is well-browned all over and no pink remains. At medium-high heat this will usually take five to seven minutes, but feel free to cook longer as needed."

There are a few different ways to drain it \u2014 see below for suggestions. One easy option is to set a metal colander in a large glass bowl, then pour the contents of the pan into the colander. The grease will drain into the bowl, where you can allow it to cool and transfer to the garbage. Another option is to set a lid over the pan, then shift it so a small crack remains at one side. Carefully tilt the pan to drain the grease into a container that won't melt from the heat, then discard in the garbage. Don't pour grease down the drain. It can solidify, clogging the drain."
