Then use the four corners of the square/rectangle to draw a line reaching the four corners of the page. This will create a 3D effect. The bigger the square, the closer the image will appear and the smaller the centre square, the farther away the image will seem."

The forehead hair can be made wavy, getting wider as it reaches the ears. The length of the hair can be perfected later on. This is the pencil work that needs to be light yet well defined. You may have to erase many lines to get the look right. The details like eyes, nose, lips need not be stressed while sketching as while coloring, it may not remain the same size as was with the pencil work. If you tend to get the color smudged, you can leave coloring the facial features for last. You can use coloring pencils to make thin and fine lines (over your pencil work) after coloring the entire picture."

Draw a small u shape, to make the pupil. Make the three bent lines on both sides for both the eyes. The pupils can be shaded with blue or brown pencil with dots inside to create more emotions and glow on it."

Now that the face looks ready, you can make the lines darker, especially if you are not planning on coloring it. Simply shading the entire drawing with a pencil can also look tremendously impactful."

You can mirror the shoulders to make them exactly in the same position or you can try a variation by bending one more than the other. The angles differ. The thickness of the arm can be simply maintained by straight lines as you don't need curved lines while drawing long sleeves. The palm need not be showing all the fingers clearly. You can choose to make them clearly or just make two U shapes, for the thumb and them a bigger U for the fingers collectively. You can use two tones of beige color to make the finger lines. Cover the neckline. Make a U shape at the end of the neck to make the neckline."

Draw some curved sleeping lines to show the legs in the sitting position. Extend the robe further below and make the lines in a more wider as it reaches the hem or the feet. Make the hem wavy or you can show a pleated or folded look with box-like pattern drawn near the hem."

You can make a double S shape which gets thinner at the end and make small shapes of design on it. Not much of the throne needs to be visible as Jesus will be having most of it covered. Only the handle, legs of the throne and small portions of the backrest might be visible. Make feather-like shape for the backrest. Try to make it beautiful using a clear outline, borders on the top and then some pattern on it. Color the borders with golden or any shimmery colors."

The palm can have a small u for the thumb and a slightly larger u for all the four fingers together. Not much detailing needs to be done with their fingers.

Make the outer wavy line first and have them join the cherub's body in a curved line. Keep making more and more wavy lines inside the wing if you like, to make them look layered. While coloring, you can use a single color for the entire cherub. You can use a darker shade of the color you used to shade the folds and outline of the body."

Carefully avoid touching the nose and the lips. Start the beard near the ears and finish it with small vertical lines. Make it a little longer at the center. Have a small portion of the chin, bow the lips show above the beard for a proper look. Doing the moustache and the beard after coloring the face is wiser as it will stand out and it won't smudge or spread with the skin color as you sketch it the last."

When you add the tie up or any other pattern to fasten the curtains at the center, make the curtain narrow down at that point. Make some lines of shading starting right where the curtain is tied up (the center). Remember that the lines will be closer and clustered near the tie up and will become broader as it reaches out.

Only a single side of the cherub may be visible, i.e. either the left or the right. So, the back can start near the waist. You can complete the entire stretch from the waist to the toe in one wavy line. Make the feet in a curved box shape. Just make the big toe stretched out. Draw wings. Start at their shoulders and make wavy lines reaching the toes. You can make the wings like bird's wings. Make the outer wavy line first and have them join the cherub's body in a curved line.

Draw an oval or a curved line on the forehead of Jesus to make His crown. Start a little above the eyebrows and make both the corners go up. Give shape to the crown. Make a pointed top and have the crown shaped circular as it reaches the forehead. Embellish the crown with diamonds of the color you like. Shape the diamonds in any way you like, like round, ovals, square, triangle etc. Make the base color of the crown golden using golden color.

You can make the legs simple or make them in a different shape with wavy lines with floral cushion etc. Show depth by drawing a line going up from the right side of the footstool. At the end of it, draw a leg. The leg at the back tends to be smaller in pictures. So draw that one smaller and slightly higher than the front one. Make Jesus's feet. Draw two u shapes for the feet. Make double lines for each foot to show footwear. Color the footwear golden or any other color you like. Add a border to Jesus's robe around the hem and the sleeve. Make the ends of the robe and the sleeve stand out with double lines or adding another color to it. Make prints on them and add a different color to the lace and border. You can make a prominent print on the sleeves like below the shoulders to add a prince-like touch to Jesus's robe. Make a cloud-like shape or an almond shape and make more layers inside to complete the print. Add curtains. Make a 3 shape at the extreme left of the drawing for curtains. Make both the top and the bottom end open. Add a flair at the lower half. Add a band or a tie up look with double lines at the middle of the curtains and then make a bow shape with the loose ends hanging down. When you add the tie up or any other pattern to fasten the curtains at the center, make the curtain narrow down at that point.

Color it last after coloring the curtains so the motif and the spots show clearly and don't mix with the background. Make a tassle at the end of each curve to add a touch of creativity to it. Make a carpet. Make a long and rectangular carpet to fill the empty space on the floor. Add double lines at its borders and keep it bright with a neatly colored look. Fill the empty spaces. Add a string of leaf-like pattern around the curtains. Make pillars to the left and the right side of Jesus or leave them clear colored in a single color of your choice.
