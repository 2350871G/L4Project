      "description":"Although Oreo cookies (along with some of the Oreo and Oreo filling) will work, some places say you can use brownies while others say you can substitute Andes candies, but most will need to be ground or cut up into tiny pieces so as to make them able to hold the remainder of the levels on top of one another. You will need at least 10 Oreo cookies for one level of the trifle, but this number will vary based on how big you intend to use to fill the container with, along with how chocolatey you'd like your recipe to be. If using brownies, you can use brownies from a standard box mix, make homemade brownies, or buy unfrosted brownies from a store. You should cut the brownies into small chunks before using them in the trifle."

      "description":"Although you'll need at least one package of instant vanilla pudding, you can add several drops of mint extract and some green food coloring to the mixture until the colors and tastes are close to mint or at normal mint levels. Let the pudding chill slightly before moving on. Sometimes around the Christmas holidays, some stores carry mint puddings which you can make (oftentimes, this will be in store-brand types). While this will help negate the taste of the vanilla when it reaches your mouth to be eaten, sometimes this is not possible. You may choose to purchase them and use them instead. If not, you are forced to use the alternative-given procedure given above (within this step)."

Layer that with a layer of the thick layer of cut-up cookie pieces. Place some whipped cream or Cool Whip cream (not spray-styled cream as that spray is too thick) as another layer, then run another set of cookie pieces or brownie pieces-layer and repeat."
