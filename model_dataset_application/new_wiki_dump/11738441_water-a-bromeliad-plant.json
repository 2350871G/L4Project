To get rainwater, place a plastic bucket or glass jar outside (with a collection funnel) and let it fill up during the next downpour. Don't use a metal bucket because metallic elements seeping into the water can harm the plant. If you can't gather rainwater, let tap water sit for a day or 2 before using it to water the plant so that some of the chlorine and lime can evaporate. Avoid using purified or distilled water because the use of reverse osmosis filters out a lot of the minerals that bromeliad plants need to thrive."

If you don't detect any moisture in the top 2 in (5.1 cm) of soil, wait another day or 2 before checking it again. Bromeliads are generally very tolerant of droughts and don\u2019t like to be overwatered."

You should fill this cup and let the water spill out onto the soil around the base of the plant. Rinse out the tank once a week by pouring the water into a bowl or cup.

Don't worry about giving it too much water because air plants only take in the moisture they need. During the winter, decrease the frequency to once every 3 weeks.
