As a bonus, coffee grounds can absorb odors, so they might help keep your trash from smelling bad. While you can just throw grounds in the trash, there are a variety of ways to reuse them. Reducing the amount of trash you send to the landfill is good for the environment."

Additionally, coffee grounds can cause major septic system problems, so keeping them out of your plumbing is especially important if you have a septic tank."

Search online to see if this service is available in your area. You fill the bin up with compostable waste, then they pick it up and replace the filled bin with a fresh one. If you don\u2019t want to pay for curbside composting service, you can also make your own compost pile."

Every 10 minutes, rotate the baking sheet and check to see if they\u2019re dry. Wet coffee grounds promote mold growth, so any that you\u2019re storing for reuse need to be dried."

Massage your face and any areas of dry, flaky skin, then rinse off the grounds and oil with lukewarm water. If you have oily skin, skip the olive oil. Just massage your face with coffee grounds, then rinse. A teaspoon or so of grounds here and there won\u2019t clog your drains, but you still shouldn't get in the habit of pouring them down the drain. For larger amounts, like \u20444  c (59 mL), you'll definitely need to collect the used grounds with a drain stopper instead of letting them go down the drain."
