This way, the prizes won\u2019t be packed together so tightly that they\u2019re hard to pick up with a claw. This effectively means that you should look for prize pits that aren\u2019t more than about halfway full. Be on the lookout for prize pits where all the stuffed animal prizes are facing outward and look very tightly packed. The prizes in those machines will probably be very hard to pick up."

Although 4-pronged claws are pretty good at picking up stuffed animals, you\u2019ll have the most luck with most prizes by using a 3-pronged claw. 4-pronged claws are great for grabbing around the chest area of a stuffed animal. When you use this type of claw on a stuffed animal, try to maneuver the claw so that the four prongs are positioned both above and below the arms with the central part of the claw close to the neck or high chest area."

          "description":"As that person is playing, pay attention to how the machine operates and how difficult it is to pick up a prize with it. Count how many seconds the machine gives the player after they put their money in, as well. For example, when the player ahead of you goes to pick up a prize, look to see how loose the grip on the claw is. If it\u2019s a very loose grip and doesn\u2019t hold on to prizes very well, you probably shouldn\u2019t play that machine, since it\u2019ll be very difficult to win. Another thing to pay attention to is how easy the crane is to move around. It will be useful to know ahead of time how jerky or smooth the crane moves around over the prize pit.Tip: Some claws drift to the right or left when they move up and down. Pay attention to how the claw drifts when the player ahead of you drops it into the prize pit."
