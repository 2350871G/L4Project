EXPERT ADVICE\t\t\t\tKatherine Tlapa, an interior designer, responds: \"A curtain rod should be 6-8 inches above the window. If you have low ceilings and can't go that far up, just put them as high as you can above - this helps the window and ceilings appear larger\""

          "description":"Extending your curtain rod 3\u20136 inches (7.6\u201315.2 cm) beyond the frame of your window makes your window seem larger and allows additional light to stream in. This way, when your curtains are open, they will rest against the wall rather than blocking the light from the window. Note that some curtain rods are a fixed length, while others are spring-loaded and adjustable. If there isn't enough room on either side of the window for a rod that extends on either side, use 1 curtain panel instead of 2 and push it all the way to 1 side when you open it to keep the window from looking too small."

A rod that is longer than this without support brackets at this interval will have difficulty supporting the weight of your curtains. Make sure you install the brackets in a location where they won't interfere with hanging, opening, or closing the curtains."

Take a picture of the room where you'll be hanging the curtain rod, and bring it with you when you look at finials.

Use your finial to highlight a pattern or motif already present in your room, perhaps a part of the upholstery or wallpaper, for a greater design impact. For example, if you have floral wallpaper, you could choose a fleur-de-lis finial to enhance the flower motif. If you redecorate the room, you can easily swap out the finial to match the new look while keeping the curtain rod in place."
