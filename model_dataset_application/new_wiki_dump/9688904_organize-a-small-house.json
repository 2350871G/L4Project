          "description":"The living room is often the largest area of a house, but many people use it exclusively as a family or TV room. To open up more space, try dividing your living room into multiple zones with their own unique designs. These quadrants can stand in for rooms that you don\u2019t have enough space for, such as a dining room, playroom, or den. To partition the area with dividers, purchase large curtains, tides, or free-standing walls and arrange them inside your living room. To create quadrants without using dividers, arrange objects in the room based on their specific function."

          "description":"For most people, a bedroom is a private area that doesn\u2019t easily convert into a family or guest room. However, bedrooms are often the perfect location for a home office, personal den, or other private space. Converting your bedroom into a multi-purpose personal area will open up more rooms throughout your house without removing any privacy. If necessary, divide the room into quadrants so you have distinct areas for sleeping, relaxing, doing work, and the like. For particularly small rooms, see if your furniture items can serve 2 or more purposes, such as using your bed as a sofa or office chair."

To open up an extra room for more important things, clear out your dining room and eat in the kitchen instead."

Often referred to as smart furniture, these objects fulfill a main function, like seating, while hiding a second function within, typically additional storage. Common forms of smart furniture include storage cubes that double as foot rests, tables that come with drawers, and cabinets that contain a desk-like board you can pull out. Look for objects around your house that can serve multiple functions, such as a chair you can attach a storage bag to or a TV stand you can keep things on. You can often find cheap furniture at garage sales, thrift shops, and flea markets, many of which either serve multiple purposes or can be easily converted into multiple-purpose objects."

          "description":"Depending on how much room you have, a full-sized bed may not be a good option. Instead, try going with something that better utilizes the space around it. For tiny houses, a loft bed installed over your bedroom will open up a massive amount space. For houses where the bedroom doubles as the living room, buy a futon so you have both a couch and a bed. If you end up purchasing a regular bed, try to get a model that has drawers inside the bed frame. If you want to use your current bed, try holding it up on firm wooden blocks to create extra storage space underneath."

This will open up a lot of additional space while providing the exact same level of functionality. If possible, convert your table into a storage area as well by placing a long tablecloth over it and hiding containers underneath."

This will open up a lot of extra space for heavier and more fragile items. Instead of a professional pot rack, try purchasing a large pegboard.

Creating an open-faced pantry with a free standing or wall mounted shelf system will better utilize the available space while encouraging you to pare down and organize the supplies you already have.
