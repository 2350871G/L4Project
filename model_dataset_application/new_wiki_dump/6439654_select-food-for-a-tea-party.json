Think about what you can save money on; for example, paper napkins don't have to come from a high end retailer. Milk can be from anywhere, as long as it's fresh. Shop for any vegetables, i.e. cucumber, at the market or greengrocers instead of the supermarket. A bakery, especially at the end of the day, might be a more cost effective option for some items than the supermarket. Don't over cater. Unless you want to be eating tea party food for days after your event, or worse, throwing away spoiled food, buy enough food, not too much."
