This process should get most of the dry powder up. It's best to get as much of the dry powder up as you can, as when you add a stain remover or any wet ingredient, it will spread the stain around a bit."

          "description":"Pour a little of the cleaner on a white washcloth, and then dab at the stain with the solvent. As the cloth becomes saturated with the makeup, move to a clean spot on the washcloth. This might remove all the stain, and you won't need to take further steps. To get the solvent out of the carpet, blot it with a clean, damp cloth. Work in a ventilated area when using dry cleaning solvent. Even though dry cleaning solvent is a liquid, it doesn't contain water. Therefore, it's less likely to spread the stain around. Plus, it helps get up greasy or messy products like eyeshadow."

Rearranging the cloth so you have a clean area to work with, press down again. Repeat this a few times. While water can spread the stain, a barely damp washcloth will pick up some of the powder without spreading it; just make sure you dab and don't rub the stain, which will spread it around."

Rub at the stain with a clean towel until it comes up and you get all of the cleaner out. If you don't have glass cleaner, you can pour 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of ammonia into 0.5 cups (120 mL) of warm water. Use it the same way as the glass cleaner. Always spot check the carpet first, as most glass cleaners do have some dye in them. Never mix ammonia and bleach, as it makes toxic fumes.

This should bring up the stain. Test the hydrogen peroxide on a hidden part of the carpet first to make sure it won't stain. It's best to only try hydrogen peroxide if you have light colored carpet because it can cause bleaching."
