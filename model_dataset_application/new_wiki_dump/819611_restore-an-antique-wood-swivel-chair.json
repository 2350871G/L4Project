Consider whether the chair is solid enough to be worth salvaging and if parts or mimic parts can be made for the chair. Another thing to check for is insect damage; if the chair has holes in it, does this effect the look or even the stability of it?

Indeed, if the swivel mechanism needs replacing, unless you are keen to work it out and possibly make errors, or you know what you're doing, it's recommended to get some professional help.
