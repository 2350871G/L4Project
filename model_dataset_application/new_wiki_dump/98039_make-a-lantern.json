          "description":"Decide on what moss, or combination of moss, you\u2019ll use inside the lantern, and then place it on the polyester filling. There are a couple of ways that you can do this:\nRemove the polyester filling from the Mason jar and roll it around in the moss, then add additional moss and hold it on to the filling as you lower the filling into the Mason jar. From there, you can use your fingers to place any additional moss between the filling and wall of the jar, until you\u2019re happy with how it looks. Keep the filling in the jar and, holding the jar on its side, use your fingers to gently place bits of moss between the filling and the wall of the jar, until you\u2019re happy with how it looks. Note that you only need to place the moss on the outer layer of filling. You\u2019ll only be able to see the moss that shows through the glass walls of the Mason jar, so don\u2019t worry about putting moss anywhere except for between the filling and the jar\u2019s walls."

          "description":"Avoid the temptation to completely cover the walls of your Mason jar in moss. Too much moss will block the light from the electric candle. More moss may look nicer when the lights are on, but when the lights are off, the filling will simply look like a twinkling fairy light behind a lovely forest pattern."

          "headline":"Remove some filling from the middle of the lantern.",
          "description":"Use your fingers to carve out a core inside the lantern. This is where your tea light will sit. Be sure to leave enough filling that it firmly holds the moss against the walls of the jar. Carving out a hole slightly larger than the tea light will work fine. It may take some experimentation to see what\u2019s perfect. After trying the lantern out, if you want the light to shine through more vibrantly, you can remove a bit more filling."

        {
          "headline":"Place the lid on the jar and test the lantern.",
          "description":"Once you place the lid on the jar, turn it upside down so that the jar is sitting on its lid. Everything should stay in place. If it doesn\u2019t, add more filling. At this point you can also test the lantern by turning on the electric tea light and making any adjustments you want to make in order to get the look you desire."

If you don\u2019t like the way the lid looks bare, you can glue some fabric on the lid and wrap that in twine instead. It\u2019s recommended to use a neutral or earthy shade of twine to match the natural mossy colors of the lantern."

Next, pull the wire upwards and loop it over the jar to the desired size of the handle that you want, then cut the wire. Wrap one end of the wire around the jar\u2019s mouth, bend the wire up as if making a handle, and then secure the end of the wire to the start of the handle by bending it into a loop with pliers.

Lay out your materials. Have a few clumps of polyester filling and moss in front of you, plus your open mason jar(s), with the lid(s) nearby. You\u2019ll also want to have your electric tea light ready. Measure how much polyester filling you need. To do this, simply grab some filling and place it inside your Mason jar. The jar will need to be well packed with filling, but you\u2019ll need some space right in the middle to place your electric tea light. Sprinkle some moss into the empty Mason jar. The bottom of the Mason jar will be the top of your lantern. To make sure it\u2019s well covered with moss, sprinkle some into the jar before adding your polyester filling. Add your moss to the outer layer of polyester filling. Decide on what moss, or combination of moss, you\u2019ll use inside the lantern, and then place it on the polyester filling. There are a couple of ways that you can do this:\nRemove the polyester filling from the Mason jar and roll it around in the moss, then add additional moss and hold it on to the filling as you lower the filling into the Mason jar. From there, you can use your fingers to place any additional moss between the filling and wall of the jar, until you\u2019re happy with how it looks. Keep the filling in the jar and, holding the jar on its side, use your fingers to gently place bits of moss between the filling and the wall of the jar, until you\u2019re happy with how it looks. Note that you only need to place the moss on the outer layer of filling. You\u2019ll only be able to see the moss that shows through the glass walls of the Mason jar, so don\u2019t worry about putting moss anywhere except for between the filling and the jar\u2019s walls. Don\u2019t go overboard. Avoid the temptation to completely cover the walls of your Mason jar in moss. Too much moss will block the light from the electric candle. More moss may look nicer when the lights are on, but when the lights are off, the filling will simply look like a twinkling fairy light behind a lovely forest pattern. Remove some filling from the middle of the lantern. Use your fingers to carve out a core inside the lantern. This is where your tea light will sit. Be sure to leave enough filling that it firmly holds the moss against the walls of the jar. Carving out a hole slightly larger than the tea light will work fine. It may take some experimentation to see what\u2019s perfect. After trying the lantern out, if you want the light to shine through more vibrantly, you can remove a bit more filling. Place the tea light inside the lantern. You\u2019ll want the \u201cflame\u201d to be facing the bottom of the jar, which will be the top of your lantern. Add a small amount of filling to the jar once the electric tea light is in. This will help hold it in place and keep it from jiggling around. Place the lid on the jar and test the lantern. Once you place the lid on the jar, turn it upside down so that the jar is sitting on its lid. Everything should stay in place. If it doesn\u2019t, add more filling. At this point you can also test the lantern by turning on the electric tea light and making any adjustments you want to make in order to get the look you desire. Decorate the jar. Once the lantern is done, wrap some twine around around the neck of the jar (just below the ridges that you screw the lid on to) and tie it in a bow. If you don\u2019t like the way the lid looks bare, you can glue some fabric on the lid and wrap that in twine instead. It\u2019s recommended to use a neutral or earthy shade of twine to match the natural mossy colors of the lantern. Enjoy your lantern! It\u2019s not much to look at in the day, but it\u2019s lovely in the dark. Follow these instructions to switch the lantern on and off:\nStand it up (lid up), open the lid, remove the piece of filling that holds the electric tea light in place, switch on or off the tea light, then replace the filling and the lid. Making a Lanterns Out of Old Jars Gather your materials: Glass jars Design templates Removable adhesive paper Scissors Glass frosting/frosted glass spray Candles (votives or tea lights are recommended) Heavy wire (optional) Wire cutters (optional) Pliers (optional) Sand, sea salt or epsom salt (optional) Wire hangers (optional) Ensure that your jar is clean and dry.  Draw designs on the non-sticky side of removable adhesive paper. You can use stencils or free-style it \u2014 just make sure your designs are easy to cut out! You can also use stickers whose shapes you like, as long as don't mind throwing them away. Cut out your designs and stick them to your jar. Be sure to stick them to the outside of the jar. Spray the jar with glass frosting spray. Ensure that you\u2019ve sprayed the jar evenly, and that you\u2019ve covered the designs that you\u2019ve stuck to the jar. Allow the glass-frosting spray to dry. Make sure it\u2019s completely dry before you move to the next step. It may take less than 10 minutes to dry, depending on the spray. The drying time should be clearly stated on the back of the spray can. If you\u2019re unsure of whether the spray is dry, touch the glass. It should feel dry. Remove the adhesive designs from the outside of the jar. Once the glass frosting spray is completely dry, you can remove the adhesive designs. This will leave you with a frosted glass lantern with clear spots where the designs were. Place a candle inside your lantern. To keep the candle stationary, you can nestle it into some sand, sea salt, or epsom salt. Add a handle (optional). If you want to hang your lantern, you\u2019ll need to add a handle. To make a handle:\nTo determine the length you need, wrap a piece of strong wire around the mouth of the jar, just beneath the ridges where the lid would screw on. Next, pull the wire upwards and loop it over the jar to the desired size of the handle that you want, then cut the wire. Wrap one end of the wire around the jar\u2019s mouth, bend the wire up as if making a handle, and then secure the end of the wire to the start of the handle by bending it into a loop with pliers. Bend the free end of the wire into a handle and then secure it to the wire that sits around the jar\u2019s mouth, on the other end of the jar, by using pliers to bend it into a loop around that wire. Enjoy your lantern!  Making a Thumb Tack Paper Lantern Gather your materials: Card stock paper in colors, patterns, and textures of your choosing A pencil and good-quality eraser A thumb tack Scissors or a paper cutter Double-sided tape A styrofoam or foam board (for poking holes) Design stencils (optional) Decide on the size of your lantern. You\u2019ll be making this lantern by drawing on a piece of card stock, poking holes in it, taping it into a tube, and placing it over a candle. Before drawing on the card stock, decide on your lantern\u2019s size and, if necessary, cut the paper to size. You may want to choose the size of your lantern based on the candle you plan to use. You can also choose the size of the lantern based on the card stock you have or where you want to use the lantern. Draw your design on the card stock paper. Use a pencil to very lightly sketch in your desired design right at the center of the card stock. This will be the front of your lantern. You don\u2019t have to limit yourself to the front of the lantern. You can also do a larger design that goes all the way around, or off to the side. It\u2019s up to you! It may be tempting to get ambitious with your design. Just remember that the more holes you poke, the more time it\u2019ll take you to make your lantern! Remember to sketch lightly so that it\u2019s easier to erase the pencil markings once you\u2019ve poked your holes. Use a thumb tack to make holes along the lines of your design. Try to keep the space between holes as even as possible. Do this until the design is complete. You\u2019ll want to place the card stock on a piece of styrofoam or foam board for this step, so that the thumb tack has a firm surface it can fully sink into. One to two millimeters between holes would work well, but it doesn\u2019t have to be exact \u2014 you can eye it! Erase the pencil marks. Use a good, soft eraser to remove the pencil marks along your designs. A thick, soft white eraser will work well. Be sure to press gently as you erase the pencil marks, and do not hold the paper against a hard surface as you erase them, otherwise the holes you\u2019ve made may close up a bit. If the holes do close up a bit as you erase the pencil marks, it\u2019s not a big deal \u2014 just use a thumb tack to gently push them outward again. Roll the card stock into a cylinder and fasten its sides together. To fasten the sides together, place double-sided tape on the back of one side of the paper, and on the front of the other side so that when they overlap they\u2019re extra secure. If you have a large candle, you can wrap the card stock around the candle to get the shape you want. Place your paper cylinder over a lit candle. Place a votive into a glass votive holder and light it, then place the cylinder over the lit votive. To reduce the fire hazard, you can use an electric candle. Enjoy your lantern!  Making a Paper Bag Lantern Gather your materials: White paper bags (3.5 inches by 6.5 inches recommended) A bone folder (to help fold the top of the bag down) Pencil (optional) Stencils (optional) Craft knife (also known as an X-ACTO blade, optional) Small piece of cardboard (optional) Wire for hanging (22-gauge, cut into 17-inch strips recommended) Grommets and grommet pliers Electric tea lights Fold over the top inch of your paper bag. To do this, fold the top of the bag over in a slow, circular motion, moving around the bag. Clean up your fold. Pull out the gussets (the folded-in parts) on both sides of the bag and work the bone folder around the top fold until the fold is clean and the bag is flat (with the gussets out and flat too). Make a design on the bag. Use a pencil to stencil in a design on the front of the bag, then cut out the shape with a craft knife. Place a piece of cardboard inside the bag as you cut to protect the back of the bag. If you don\u2019t want to make a design on the bag, you can move down to the step in which you add grommets to the sides of the bag. Add grommets to the sides of your bag. Place 1 grommet in the middle of each side of your bag, roughly 1/2-inch down from the top of the bag. To find the center, use the crease from the mid-line of the gusset as your guide. Note that it\u2019s not necessary to hang your lantern. Some people simply drop a tea light into a white bag and leave it at that! Loop wire through the grommets to form a \u201chandle\u201d. To fasten the wire securely to the bag, pull it through the grommet and then twist the end of the wire upwards along the rest of the wire. Before you had a tea light to the bag, make sure that the wire is securely fastened to the bag. Place a tea light inside the bag. An electric tea light is highly recommended, as a regular tea light can pose a fire hazard, particularly if the lantern is hung somewhere where it might be jostled. Enjoy your lantern! ",
