Wood chip and that newsprint-type insulation have an R value of 4 to 8. Your R value should be R50. If you\u2019re not sure if that is what you have, contact a professional to inspect it for you. Contact an insulation installer and they will blow new, environmentally-friendly, highly efficient insulation into your attic. This will drastically change your energy bill. In the worst-case scenario, you've inherited Zonolite or vermiculite insulation which contains asbestos and will need to be removed immediately. Consider the insulation in your outer walls as well."

You can find supplies for this at any home improvement store. If your window frames are warped, beyond repair, or incredibly old, it might be time to install new, energy efficient windows. You may also consider adding energy efficient doors to keep in heat and avoid energy loss.

This temperature should allow you a sufficiently high water temperature for showers without wastefully overheating the water. Check the pipes and knobs on the heater as well. If they are loose, it may be leaking water or heat or it may be prone to bursting."

If your toilet is running constantly or you find a leaky faucet you should call a plumber to repair or replace them. Use a dye test to test for leaks in your toilet tank. You can purchase the dye at any home improvement store. Drop a single tablet into the tank and wait 10 minutes. If you see colored water in the bowl, you have a leak and need a plumber. Leaking pipes cause mold to develop in addition to wasting water. If you do find leaking pipes, you may also want to get a professional mold inspection. This should have been done prior to closing during house inspection process. It is required for FHA financing\nCheck underground for leaking pipes as well.

You can also get a \u201csmart\u201d thermostat that learns to adjust the temperature automatically based on your preferences. During cold months, set the temperature lower at night and when you are out of the house. Adjust the program to turn up the heat at times when you are actively using your home. Reverse that during warm months. Using an air conditioning unit during hot months may help you to cope with the heat, but it can also be expensive. You can also use fans and humidifiers for comfort during hot months."

They have longer lives, burn on less energy, and provide the same amount of light as incandescent bulbs. They can be found at any home improvement store or online. The energy cost savings of a single lightbulb are relatively small, but when you factor in all the lightbulbs in your home over a long period of time, the savings are significant. An incandescent lightbulb\u2019s energy will cost $201 over 23 years while an Light Emitting Diode (LED) bulb will be $38 over that period."

If they are not, spend extra upfront to get energy efficient models that will save you in electricity costs over time. You can also consider upgrading older appliances if they are included. Look for the Energy Star logo on appliances to tell if they are energy efficient. They will include an Energy Guide label to tell you approximately how much energy the appliance should cost you annually. You might also consider installing motion sensors that will automatically turn off lights when no one is in the room. Your utility company may offer a credit or rebate for upgrading appliances.

This only applies for an existing home that is your principal residence. New construction and rentals do not apply. Relevant appliances include stoves, heat pumps, air conditioning, water heaters, furnaces, fans, insulation, roofs, windows, doors, and skylights. You can apply for these credits on the Department of Energy\u2019s website. The site will also inform you about local and state benefits you can apply for.

If you\u2019d like to remove your PMI before you can pay off a sufficient amount of the principal, you can also remodel to increase your house\u2019s market value, refinance, or get a new appraisal. Remodeling can increase the equity of your home. This is because the additions you make add value greater than the cost of the additions and this will reflect in the equity to meet the 20% level."

Consult with your mortgage lender, an accountant or tax advisor, an attorney, and so on to discuss your options and opportunities for savings. The initial costs of a consultation will likely be a drop in the bucket in comparison to the significant savings you can accumulate for years to come. Refinancing your mortgage or appealing your property tax assessment, to name a few examples, can easily save you thousands of dollars in the years to come.

If you are using a moving company, they may charge based on cargo weight. Go around your house and get rid of unneeded items before you start packing. Hold a garage sale or donate items to charity (and earn a tax deduction). Find free boxes. When you order something over the internet, save the box instead of throwing it away. You can also go around to local businesses, especially liquor stores, groceries, and drugstores and ask for spare boxes. Try to move during the off-season. If you are hiring movers, try to schedule your move between September and May and on a weekday instead of weekend. Movers tend to charge less during these less busy times.
