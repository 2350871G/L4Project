Do your best to make the pieces the same size. If your vegetables are not the same size (and especially the same thickness), they won't finish cooking at the same time. When you take your vegetables out of the pan, some will either be over or under-cooked."

          "description":"In theory, you can saut\u00e9 vegetables in any pan, but some work better than others. A wide saut\u00e9 pan with straight sides or a skillet with sloped sides works best. Your pan should have a dense bottom so as to distribute heat evenly. A stainless steel, non-stick, aluminum, or anodized pan will work well. For dense vegetables like potatoes and cabbage, cast iron works well because it holds and evenly distributes heat."

          "description":"Choose an oil or fat to saut\u00e9 your vegetables in. Butter or any kind of oil will work. You can also use bacon fat, though this option is less healthy. While any oil will work, oils with a high smoke-point such as canola oil, peanut oil, and regular olive oil work best. Oils with a lower smoke point like extra virgin olive oil nut-infused oils can be used, but often lose their flavor when cooked at high temperatures. If you choose to saut\u00e9 in butter, adding a tablespoon of oil to the pan will help keep the butter from smoking and burning."

If you put them in before this, the oil won't be hot enough to brown them, and they may stick to the bottom of the pan. In adequate light, hot oil will become iridescent and colorful. When it takes on these characteristics, it's ready."

Minced garlic typically should be added one minute before the other vegetables. Hot peppers like jalape\u00f1os can be added five minutes before the other vegetables. Since garlic cooks quickly and burns easily, you want to saut\u00e9 it first, letting it get to a light brown color. Remove it from the pan before adding your other vegetables, then return it to the pan right as the other veggies finish cooking."

If the vegetables are piled on top of each other, the steam from the lower vegetables may become trapped. The result can be steamed vegetables rather than saut\u00e9ed ones. If you have too many vegetables to fit in the pan without overcrowding, cook them in two or more batches."

          "headline":"Cook until done.",
          "description":"How long this takes will depend on the type of vegetables. Between three and ten minutes is typical, but you'll probably need to experiment some to get this right. Vegetables with the longest cooking times include carrots, onions, and hearty greens like collards. These can take 10-15 minutes. Potatoes can take even longer, and some people simmer them in water first to make them saut\u00e9 more quickly. Covering your pot with a lid for the first few minutes may help speed up the process. Vegetables with medium cooking times include broccoli, cauliflower, bell peppers, and Brussels sprouts. These can take eight to 10 minutes. You can shorten the cook time, though, by placing these veggies in the pan with a few tablespoons of water before adding the oil. Wait for the water to evaporate, then add the oil and continue cooking. Vegetables with short cooking times include mushrooms, corn, tomatoes, and asparagus. These can cook in as little as two minutes. Spinach and other greens have the shortest cooking times, as they will quickly wilt. A minute or two should do it. If you are cooking vegetables with different cooking times in the same pan, add the ones that need to be cooked longest first, let them cook partially, and then add the vegetables that require less cooking time. Or, cook individually and then mix."
