This requires the proper exploit, an exploitable game, and an Action Replay device to connect your Xbox memory card to your computer. You'll find an overview of the process below, but for detailed instructions click here. Download an All-In-One exploit for your Xbox. You can find these by simply searching for \"all-in-one xbox exploit\" in Google, but they can't be linked here. There may be different versions of the exploit for different exploitable games. Get an original copy of a game that can be exploited. Common exploitable games include \"007: Agent Under Fire\", \"Mech Assault\", and \"Splinter Cell\". These games have errors in them that allow the mod process to install itself. You may need to download a specific All-In-One exploit depending on the game you get. Connect the Action Replay to your computer and plug in your Xbox memory card. Copy the All-In-One exploit onto the memory card, and then copy it from the memory card to your Xbox's hard drive. Start up the exploitable game and load the saved game that you copied over. This will start the flashing process. Select \"Backup eeprom\" from the menu that appears. Select \"Install softmod\" or \"Basic install\". The option will vary depending on the exploit and version you are using. After the mod is finished, you'll be asked to select the dashboard you want to use."
