          "description":"If you are noticing a lot of ice build up in your freezer, it may be a sign that something isn't functioning correctly. One potential problem is is blocked airflow. Freezers need to have proper airflow around the cooling coils and vents. If any of the freezer's vents or coils are dirty, blocked or clogged, this could cause an issue with ice build up. Condenser coils are usually located in the back of the freezer, towards the bottom of the refrigerator. You'll likely need to remove a panel to access them. Some refrigerators will have condenser coils that run up and down the entire back of the fridge. Use a soft brush to gently remove dust and dirt from the coils. Check the vents inside the freezer itself. Make sure there is no ice or food items clogging them up. Your freezer may be too close to a wall to allow for proper ventilation. Try moving your freezer away from any walls or tight spaces."

          "description":"Your freezer door should create an airtight seal when it's closed. However, if the seal itself is old or warped, it may be allowing air to flow in and out of the freezer. Airflow will cause ice to build up rapidly in your freezer. Check your freezer door's seal to make sure there are no spaces where air is escaping. Make sure something in the freezer isn't holding the door open a bit. There may be a tiny space where air is entering the freezer. Run your hand along the edge of the seal to feel for any loose or cold areas. You may need to replace older magnetic seals if they are no longer functioning. You can try wiping the seal down to remove any buildup that may be preventing an airtight lock."

          "description":"Setting your freezer's temperature either too high or too low can cause excess ice to build up. In order to prevent these freezer crystals from accumulating, it can be a good idea to take a look at your freezer's thermometer. Try to adjust the thermometer to an ideal temperature to reduce the amount of ice that is forming in your freezer. Your freezer should be set to 0\u00b0F or -18\u00b0C. Make sure you don't change the temperature by opening the door too often or by not closing it all the way."

          "description":"Anytime you open the door on your freezer, warm air will come rushing in. When this warm, moist air enters the freezer it will immediately freeze onto any surface it touches. Always open and close your freezer door quickly to avoid any unnecessary ice build up in your freezer. Only open the door when you need to put something in or take something out. Avoid looking too long for something in the freezer. Only open the door when you are ready to take it out. Always make sure the door is fully and completely shut when you close it."

          "description":"Much of the ice that forms in a freezer comes from the moisture in the food. In order to help cut down on the amount of ice in your freezer, it can be helpful to take air out of any freezer storage bags. Removing the air will trap the moisture in the food, instead of allowing it to escape and turn into ice elsewhere in your freezer. Squeeze the air out of any plastic freezer bags that you store food in. You can use a drinking straw to suck most of the air out of a bag, creating a near vacuum seal. Any resealed bags should be closed tightly, leaving little room for air. Solid containers should be full of food to avoid leaving much space for air. Make sure any containers with lids are securely shut. Try to use storage bags that are specifically designed for freezers."

Try to remove food that has been stored for a long time to help prevent the buildup of freezer crystals. Write the date on something you are adding to your freezer. This will help you track how long it's been stored. Freezer burn will take months to occur. Try to use or remove items that have been stored for more than a few months."
