          "description":"Some pans work better than others. Ideally, you'd like to use a heavy pan like a cast-iron pan. These pans can reach really high temperatures that help sear the edge of the meat and keep in the flavors. They also help to produce that slightly crusted char that provides a sweet flavor. Many prefer a cast-iron pan because it can be used to sear the meat before transferring it into the oven. A griddle pan could work as a substitute for a flat pan. Select a smaller pan if possible. If you choose a larger pan you may be tempted to cook more than one steak at a time, and potentially miss the mark on the doneness."

          "headline":"Preheat the pan.",
          "description":"The reason you preheat is that the steak tastes better when the edges get seared quicker. A preheated pan allows the ribeye to brown evenly, eliminating the water and creating a sweet caramelization. Aside from that, a hot pan eliminates the need to flip the meat multiple times during cooking. If you have to flip the ribeye multiple times, don't worry too much. Some tests have shown the meat to be cooked more evenly and quickly when flipped multiple times."

          "headline":"Heat some oil.",
          "description":"Choose something neutral like groundnut oil, which has a mild flavor and doesn't burn at high temperatures. Some other oils with high with smoke points are peanut oil, rice oil, and corn oil. If the oil is not hot, it could transfer an oily or greasy flavor to the meat. Use about a quarter cup (60ml) in a traditional 12-inch pan. Do not use butter as your medium, because it smokes too quickly at high temperatures. Do not mix butter with the oil. It will not stop the milk proteins in the butter from burning. To know when the oil is ready, wiggle the pan around and there should be a nice, free-flowing movement to the oil."

If the meat is cold, the outside of the meat may get dried out before everything is cooked through. It may take up to 30 minutes for a fresh out of the fridge ribeye to be ready for cooking. Be cautious not to leave the meat out too long, however; it could invite bacteria growth. Room temperature meat also cooks quicker. If it's not room temperature, there is a risk of a cold center."

In general, however, many chefs recommended dressing a steak with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, some black pepper, and kosher salt. Wait until just before cooking to apply the spices. Seasoning too long before cooking could cause the salt to dry out the ribeye."

If the meat releases, it's likely ready to flip onto the other side. If not, it needs more time. The generally accepted practice is to flip the steak one time.

In general, however, the steak should be on each side for 2:30-4:30 minutes, depending on the level of doneness you prefer. This helps it cook all the way through, as well as cook off some of the fat. For a 3.5cm/1.3in. steak, the following is a good guideline:\nRare \u2013 2:15 per side (125 F/ 51C) \u2013 There will be significant redness inside. A very pliable ribeye. Medium-rare \u2013 3:15 per side (135 F/ 57C) \u2013 More pink than red, this steak will be slightly tougher than rare and have considerable juices flowing. Medium \u2013 4:15 per side (140 F/ 60C) \u2013 Slightly pink inside, there will be minimal juice escaping. Well-done \u2013 Over 4:15 per side (155 F/ 68C) \u2013 Cooked until thoroughly dark, the level of doneness ranges from spongy to hockey puck, depending on the desired result. Some prefer to get the initial char and then put it into the oven. This is a good way to retain moistness and flavor."
