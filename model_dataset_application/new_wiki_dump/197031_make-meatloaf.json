To this end you want the bread pieces to be well torn up. If you're using oatmeal, it is best to use a food processor to grind it up, so that it is in smaller bits, because that will act as a better binder. However, it isn't entirely necessary, so if you can't grind it, your meatloaf will still come out fine (just a bit more crumbly)."
