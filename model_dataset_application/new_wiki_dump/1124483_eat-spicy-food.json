          "description":"It is always best to know your adversary before going into battle, right? Chiles are perceived as hot or spicy to us because they contain the chemical capsaicin, which enters your bloodstream and essentially convinces your body that your temperature is rising. This helps explain the sweating, flushing, and occasional light-headedness that can accompany eating spicy foods. Carried in oils in chiles, capsaicin is also a skin and mucous membrane irritant. Capsaicin is a natural defense mechanism developed by certain plants to prevent mammals from eating them. Most mammals take the hint and move on, but not us."

Our brain neurons responsible for pleasure and pain are adjacent and possibly interconnected. This helps explain why many people get a rush out of risky behavior, especially when they can experience danger/pain without much risk, such as in eating spicy food."

          "description":"People tend to assume that spicy foods cause ulcers, heartburn, and other gastrointestinal discomforts, but in fact there is no real evidence to support this. If they have this effect on you, it is likely just a sensitivity you have, like others may have to dairy, fatty foods, etc. Indeed, there is growing scientific evidence that spicy foods are good for you:  they may help you consume less calories by reducing sweet/salty/fatty cravings; increase calorie burning by increasing your body\u2019s perceived core temperature; have beneficial impacts on cardiovascular health and cholesterol levels; and, surprisingly enough, reduce gastric acid production."

          "description":"Pepper spray does indeed contain capsaicin, the same thing in those chiles you want to add to your dinner plate. So don't treat them lightly, unless you want a taste of what it is like to be pepper sprayed. Use gloves when preparing chiles. Or, at very least, wash your hands thoroughly after handling them. Protect your eyes and other sensitive areas. Consider eyewear when cutting chiles. Do not rub your eyes, nose, or mouth before washing your hands. For that matter, if you need to use the bathroom or have an itch in a sensitive area, make sure you wash your hands before (and after!). The hottest parts of a chile are the seeds and the inner membranes (usually white) that hold them in place. This is where most of the capsaicin is located. Scrape these away while preparing a chile if you want to tone things down."

Add a little spice to common foods in your current diet. Add a shake of red pepper flakes to your soup, or put a splash of hot sauce in your ketchup. Serve diced peppers, or a chile-based sauce, on the side, and add it to your food as you eat. This gives you maximum control over the spiciness."

Slowly but steadily move up the ladder from milder to spicier chiles. You can train your body to adapt to hot weather, and you can do the same with hot chiles. The Scoville Scale is the standard guide for heat in chiles. The more Scoville units, the more capsaicin, the spicier the chile. Use it as a guide on what chile to try next."

Dole out the capsaicin in smaller doses so your body can absorb it more efficiently. If you don\u2019t overwhelm your taste buds with heat, you\u2019ll be better able to appreciate the range of flavors in spicy dishes."

The idea of \u201cno pain, no gain\u201d might urge you forward, but use common sense in deciding when you\u2019ve maxed out your body\u2019s adaptability to spiciness. If you seem to have reached a plateau as you work your way up the Scoville Scale, you may just want to accept that as your limit.

If you\u2019re lactose intolerant, or at a sports bar or on a date where ordering a tall glass of milk is not ideal, there are alternatives. Capsaicin is soluble in alcohol, meaning alcoholic beverages will help wash some of it (and its burn) away. So here\u2019s your excuse to have a beer with those hot wings. Capsaicin is also soluble in oil, so you can try swirling a little vegetable or olive oil in your mouth and spitting it out (at home, preferably). Also, foods with a higher fat content like dark chocolate might provide some relief. Sugar water is another option, especially at home. Sweet (or salty, for that matter) flavors help mask the spice, and the sugar solution helps produce a coating, soothing effect as well. Add a tablespoon or so of sugar to a glass of water. This, like oil, works best as a rinse that you spit out. Avoid plain water, as whatever cooling effect it may have is countered by the fact that it just redistributes the capsaicin around you mouth or down your throat."

As noted, chiles have no unique impact on the digestive system that requires unique treatments. Try chewable or liquid antacids, Pepto-Bismol, or other such treatments that tend to work for you. If you have frequent heartburn, talk to your doctor or pharmacist about the range of over-the-counter and prescription pills now available, most of which are taken daily (before symptoms arise).
