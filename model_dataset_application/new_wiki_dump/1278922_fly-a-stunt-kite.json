The shorter rod will be stuck horizontally across the kite into the two rod fittings at the top tip of the kite. This short rod is going to keep the kite spread open near the top. Be sure to keep the kite strings (bridle) out of the way. At the base of the kite, insert one of the longer rods through the rubber fitting near the center of the kite. Stick the other end of the rod into the rubber fitting on the corresponding side edge of the kite. To match the completed side, insert the other long rod into the center rubber fitting. Then stick the corresponding end of the rod into the other rubber fitting on the side of the kite."

Hold up the kite strings to check and see if they are equal in length and balanced as you hold them. If there are any areas of your kite that are lopsided and disproportionate, it will greatly hinder the way your kite flies."

Be sure to connect your right side line to the right side bridle knot and the left side line to the left side bridle knot. Stick your thumb and pointer finger in the loop of one of your kite lines. Spread your fingers apart so the loop is taut around your fingers. Tilt your thumb and pointer finger downward, so they are on the outside of the loop. Touch your thumb and pointer finger together. The loop should now look like a very loopy and round capital \u2018A\u2019. With both fingers touching, slide the line off your pointer finger, so your thumb is now holding both loops. Insert one bridle knot through this loop and tighten the loop by tugging on the end. Do this same procedure with your other kite line and the other bridle knot."

Your lines should be unwound about 75\u2013100 feet (22.9\u201330.5 m) from your kite. Stand upwind from the kite and securely grasp onto both of your kite lines. Your lines should be running evenly back toward the kite from your standing position. If your lines come with looped handles, insert your wrists through the looped handles. The shorter your lines are, the less reaction time you have to make necessary adjustments to your kite. The longer your lines are, the more difficult it is to do tricks with your kite; especially for beginner kite flyers."

          "description":"Keep your hands symmetrical to allow the kite to find air balance for the first few minutes. To steer and spin the kite to the right, gently tug on the right string. To steer to the left, gently tug on the left string. When you finally get the hang of these movements, you can alternatively try giving slack to your left side string to steer the kite to the right, and vice versa. This \u201cpush turn\u201d is a little bit more advanced handling than normal \u201cpull turns\u201d. Your kite will spin in a circle if you hold one of the lines down for too long, That can look cool, but it will also tangle your lines. To fix this, find balance once again, and steer your kite the other way to untwist the lines."
