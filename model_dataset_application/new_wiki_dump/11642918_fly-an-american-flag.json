          "description":"There are special hooks that clip the flag to the pole rope and keep it secure. Take a bit of rope at your eye level and pinch a loop between your fingers. Insert that bit of rope through the hole on the bottom of the hook and loop it over the top. Pull the rope back so it tightens around the hook. Some clips may use different instructions, so confirm the procedure on the product you use. Starting at the eye-level is important so the flag doesn\u2019t touch the ground while you\u2019re hanging it. This is a violation of the flag code. If the flag is large, work with a second person to hold the flag so it doesn't touch the ground. You can buy flagpole clips from hardware stores or on the internet."

Raise the American flag up and attach the other flag 1 foot (0.30 m) below it. For example, in New York, the order of prominence is American flag, New York State flag, New York City flag. The only exception to this rule is if you\u2019re hanging the POW/MIA flag for veterans. This can go above state flags and directly below the American flag. Do not hang a company or business flag on the same pole as the American flag. This is against the flag code. Place it on a separate pole to the audience\u2019s right of the American flag."

Keep track of these holidays and display your flag to show your patriotism. Traditional holidays to display the flag are Memorial Day, Veterans\u2019 Day, July 4th, and Flag Day. If your state or city has particular patriotic holidays, you can also display the flag on these days. Some calendars list days that you should fly the flag on.
