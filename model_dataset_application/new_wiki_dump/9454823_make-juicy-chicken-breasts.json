If you bought a package of pre-cut cutlets, trim them so they are all very close in size. The pieces don\u2019t have to be identical, but get as close as you can. When you cook pieces of chicken that aren't similar in size, the small pieces will end up dry and overdone."

Use a meat tenderizer to pound the meat until the piece has an even thickness. Concentrate on the thickest areas, and pound them down to be even with the thinnest area of the breast. Once you\u2019re happy, move on to the next piece and repeat. Be sure to pound all the pieces to be about the same thinness so they will cook evenly. If you don\u2019t have a meat tenderizer, improvise with a rolling pin."

Add \u00bc cup (75 g) of regular salt to the bowl. Pour in 4 cups (950 ml) of water. Stir the brine until the salt dissolves. Try adding a handful of fresh herbs to your brine for an added kick.

Put the marinade in a heavy-duty zip-lock bag, then fully submerge the breasts in the marinade. Seal the bag tightly and put it in the fridge. After 6 to 8 hours, drain the marinade and proceed with your recipe. Examples of store-bought marinade flavors you can try are Lemon Pepper, Orange Sesame, and Teriyaki."

          "description":"No matter what cooking method you choose, always preheat before adding the chicken. To keep the breasts juicy, they need to cook quickly using high heat. Preheating ensures that your grill, oven, skillet, etc. is at full temperature and ready to go when you add the meat to it. An oven is ready when the \"Preheat\" light turns off, or it beeps. For a gas grill, turn the heat to high and put the lid on for 10 to 15 minutes. For a charcoal grill, close the lid and let it heat up for 5 minutes. For a skillet, place it on a burner over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Flick a drop of water into the skillet; if it sizzles, the skillet is preheated."

If your breasts have been pounded quite thin, insert the wand horizontally, from the side, rather than sticking it into the top. Chicken breast is ready once it\u2019s internal temperature reads 160\u00b0 F (71\u00b0 C). It should still be juicy at this temperature. Anything over that will compromise the juiciness."

It will come away easily. Plate the chicken and serve immediately."
