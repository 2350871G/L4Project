The more blankets you can use, the better. You should have at least one layer of blankets covering your whole car, but if you can double or triple up the blankets, it will give your car more protection. If you\u2019re short on blankets, cover your windows first. Duct tape the blankets at the bottom of your car.

  "text":" Driving in Hail Pull over under a freeway overpass for cover if you can. If you\u2019re already driving and hail starts to come down, look for the closest cover for your car. Freeway overpasses and gas stations with canopies are great options for last-minute coverage if you're caught in your car when hail starts.
