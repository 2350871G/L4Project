But it has half the calories of an equal serving of romaine lettuce, and about 40% of the calories you\u2019d get in an equal serving of iceberg lettuce. It also has vitamin A and vitamin K in ample amounts. Arugula, likewise, is low in calories, and weighs in at just six calories per cup. It also has a variety of nutrients and phytochemicals that could prevent certain types of cancer. Possibly the lowest-calorie salad green is watercress. Watercress is an aquatic plant native to Asia and Europe. It has just four calories per cup."

          "description":"If you\u2019re looking for salad greens packed with vitamins and minerals, you\u2019ll need something more substantial than arugula and iceberg lettuce. Instead, you\u2019ll need to choose spinach. Spinach has lots of vitamin K, C, A, and B-complex vitamins. It also has a hefty dose of calcium and iron. Another nutritious salad green is romaine lettuce. Unlike iceberg lettuce, romaine has lots of vitamin A \u2013 81% of your daily dose per cup, in fact. It has ample quantities of vitamin K, too. Spinach has more vitamin K per serving than any other salad green. Romaine lettuce has more vitamin A and more vitamin C per serving than any other salad green. Romaine and spinach are just about tied for having the most folate per serving."

For instance, you could mix one cup of arugula, one cup of chopped romaine lettuce, and once cup of spinach in a tasty salad. Or you could mix one cup of kale, one cup of iceberg lettuce, and one cup of radicchio. Remember, there is no wrong way to mix salad greens.

If you have kidney stones, for instance, you should avoid spinach and Swiss chard.

Your exact caloric needs depend on your age, sex, activity level, and weight. Use a caloric intake chart like the one produced by the American Diabetes Association to determine your caloric needs based on the relevant data. There is no daily nutritional requirement for salad greens. Instead, there is only a requirement for vegetables. If you wish, however, you could use salad greens to satisfy your daily nutritional requirement for vegetables. Most adults require two to three cups of vegetables per day. However, this metric counts two cups of raw salad greens or one cup of cooked salad greens as a single cup. In other words, you will need to consume four to six cups of raw salad greens in order to meet the average daily nutritional requirement. If you are very active, you will need to consume more food \u2013 including more vegetables \u2013 than someone who is less active."

Fresh salad greens need to be refrigerated at 32 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit (zero to four degrees Celsius). There are several options for you to store your salad greens in the refrigerator. If you have unpackaged salad greens, wash and dry them before attempting to store them. You could choose to store your salad greens in a plastic container lined with paper towels. For instance, you might line a plastic storage container intended for use in the fridge with paper towels, then pour a layer of salad greens into the container. On top of that, place another paper towel and top it with more salad greens. Continue in this way until the container is full. You could also place your salad greens directly into your crisper drawer. The crisper drawer is the bottom-most drawer in your fridge. Just empty it of its contents, line it with paper towels, and add alternating layers of salad greens and paper towels. Stored properly, your salad greens will last over 10 days."
