          "description":"Deadheading means trimming off blooms when they first begin to fade. For rosette salvia, the flowers will usually fade towards the middle of the summer and begin dropping seeds. Plan on removing any flowers as soon as they begin turning to a dull green or brown color. Trimming the flowers causes the salvia to bloom a second time. Normal salvia blooms are colorful, so you can easily see when bright blue or violet flowers begin fading."

Using a sharp pair of shears, trim the stem right above the leaves and buds. These buds branch off into secondary flower spikes. Rosette-type salvia plants grow stems out of a circle of leaves close to the ground. Tall flower spikes form on these stems. Rosette salvia plants include Woodland Sage, Caradonna, and May Night Sage."

The salvia\u2019s flower stalks grow out of it. Snip all of the remaining stems right above these leaves. After trimming the stalks, only the leaves and possibly a small amount of stalk should remain. Be sure to take out any dead plant material you notice, since it can prevent light from reaching the bottom of the plant."

You can protect them by spreading an organic compost, followed by an organic mulch like pine bark. Spread these products as far as the pruned salvia reaches, but avoid letting it touch the plant\u2019s stem. You can also cover the plant with fleece or leaf-filled garbage bags and a tarp. Weigh these items down to keep them in place. The first frost happens around fall when the temperatures drop below 32 \u00b0F (0 \u00b0C)."
