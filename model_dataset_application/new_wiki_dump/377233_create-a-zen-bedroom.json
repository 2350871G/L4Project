Having a clean space to rest is the first step to feeling more at ease when you go to bed, and this goes for all of your surfaces\u2014floors, desks, walls, etc. Put clothes from the floor in the closets, drawers, or hamper. Give the floor a little sweep every week as well for that extra clean feeling under your feet. Arrange and file papers on your desk. Loose pens, messy makeup, or other types of clutter need to be put up or away. Get a \u201cchange bowl\u201d for you to put your keys, headphones, or loose articles without a place so that they still feel organized, too. Only keep what you need to get through the night on your bedside table. That means a glass of water and maybe a tissue. Swap out your phone\u2019s alarm for a conventional alarm clock. This will reduce the urge to use your phone before bed or during the night. Move your phone charger across the room or into the bathroom, for example."

          "description":"Feng shui dictates that your bedroom\u2019s \u201ccommanding position\u201d of the bed is farthest away from the door. The \u201ccommand position\u201d is the place in the room where you\u2019re most ready to deal with whatever comes your way, literally and figuratively. If distance is not achievable, at least position your bed so it faces the door to create a feeling of security and safety. Don\u2019t forget you can position your bed in a corner if you have space. This supposedly offers better chi by not aligning the bed with the entrance to the room. If you have a window, position the bed to where you can see both the door and the window\u2014unless you aren\u2019t on the ground floor. Then it is still a safe feeling to put the headboard at the window. Don\u2019t totally block your natural daylight, though!"

          "description":"Having a more open floor plan in the bedroom helps in feeling less cluttered, just like a clean desktop. The easier it is to move in the room, the more comfortable it will feel. To save work, practice by drawing different arrangements before starting to move the furniture. Do not block out windows or doors in order to make distance with furniture. Instead, consider removing a piece of furniture to another room if it is too crowded. Less is more! Try to center pieces of furniture on their respective walls. This helps to keep corners and walkways from getting too cramped."

          "description":"Sleep is best done in the quiet, peaceful darkness. Opt for blackout curtains on the windows that will not only keep out light but insulate from extra noise. Closing the door when you go to bed will also make sure that anyone else in the hall or room next to you doesn\u2019t unintentionally wake you up. If you live in a noisy part of town or near an active roadway, try a white noise machine or swiveling fan to counteract some of the noise. If you like to wind down at the end of the day to TV, do so in another room. You don\u2019t want to leave the TV on overnight or associate your room with being awake. During the day, open the blinds. Let in natural daylight, if you can, over artificial lighting."

Light blues and greens work as well to create a feeling of calmness without making the room feel too dark. Shades of blue are considered the most psychologically calming color to humans.

Do not forget to water and provide light per your plant\u2019s instructions. The act of taking care of the plant itself can be a form of meditation.

They create active energy that opposes the peaceful feeling of sleep. Hide them in a closet or leave them in the bathroom. Don\u2019t have anything hanging above your bed either.

Do some reading or your bedtime routine without your screens. Unless your phone is also your alarm clock (which you can change), try leaving it charging overnight in the bathroom or kitchen.

Feel the stresses or anxieties of your day leave your body before you lie down to rest. Avoid pairing meditation with yoga just before bed.

Negotiate a few degrees of cooler temperature with a more insulated blanket. If a thermostat is not available to adjust, try using a fan.
