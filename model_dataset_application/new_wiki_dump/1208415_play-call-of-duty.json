It's important to be comfortable with these mechanics before you start a game. When learning primary gameplay mechanics, it's best to start with a game that uses clunkier mechanics (e.g., Modern Warfare Remastered) than a newer game. This will allow you to understand the base mechanics without some of the extra conveniences you'll find in newer games. A good way to learn these mechanics is by starting an offline multiplayer game by yourself and testing out each of the buttons on your controller. Once you're comfortable with the buttons, their functions, and general movement, you can start doing more complex things like shooting, reloading, switching weapons, and so on."

Each game has slightly different secondary gameplay mechanics, so spend some time getting to know them before jumping into a multiplayer game. Playing the campaign is a good way to do this. Observing other players' uses of secondary mechanics may also help you."

Passive players wait for enemies to come to them, while aggressive players take the fight to the other team. It's good to be aggressive in Call of Duty, but you might want to start out by playing passively until you've mastered the basics."

Call of Duty games all have fairly quick TTK values, so you shouldn't need to empty your whole magazine into an enemy player; a few rounds will usually do the trick. TTK will vary depending on the gun you're using. Once you understand your gun's TTK, try to use the appropriate number of rounds per engagement. It can be tempting to reload as soon as you've shot an enemy two or three times, but make sure you've actually finished off the enemy before doing so."

          "description":"With the exception of Call of Duty 1, 2, and 3, COD multiplayer is fundamentally identical across its various games: after selecting a game type, you're placed in a lobby with other players, and your teams are determined randomly (not applicable for free-for-all game modes). You'll then play at least one round of the game type. Depending on the game type, you may play several rounds before the match is officially over. Typically speaking, you'll be placed in a new match within a couple minutes of the last one ending if you don't exit the lobby."

          "headline":"Know how to level up.",
          "description":"Leveling up is automatic in every Call of Duty game. Playing in matches (e.g., killing enemies, completing objectives, etc.) earns you experience points (XP); once you've earned enough points to level up, your character will do so. As you level up, you'll unlock new weapons, perks, killstreaks, and so on. Most COD games allow you to unlock attachments for your guns by using the guns in question (e.g., getting a certain number of kills with an AK-47 will unlock a red dot sight for the AK-47). Games in the Black Ops series handle unlocks in a different way: once you level up, you receive a token that you can spend on any item for which your current level is appropriate."

If you're an agressive player, rush the enemy team as soon as the match starts, and if you're a conservative player, hang back while everyone else rushes. Versatility is key in Call of Duty, so you will occasionally have to change up your playing style to fit maps or gametypes. For example, if you usually play aggressively but you're defending an objective, it's best to play more conservatively for the time being."

          "description":"After you play enough to reach level 4, you'll be able to create your own \"classes\", which are loadouts including weapons, grenades, and modifiers of your choosing. While classes vary slightly from game to game, most include the following aspects:\n\nPrimary weapon \u2014 Your main weapon. Categories include assault rifles, SMGs, shotguns, sniper rifles, and LMGs. Secondary weapon \u2014 Your backup weapon. Categories include pistols, riot shields, rocket launchers, and\u2014in some games\u2014shotguns. Lethal and Nonlethal \u2014 Throwable items. Lethal items include things like grenades, Semtex, and throwing knives, while nonlethal options include flashbang grenades, stun grenades, and so on. Perks \u2014 Modifiers that change attributes about your character. Perks do things like allowing you to run faster, carry more ammo, avoid showing up on the minimap, and so on. Killstreaks \u2014 Rewards you can earn for getting consecutive kills without dying. These include things like radar for your team, airstrikes, gunship support, and tactical nukes. Some games also have death-streaks that will activate after several deaths with no kills. Wildcards \u2014 Modifiers in the Black Ops series. These allow you to \"break\" the game's rules by doing things like taking an extra attachment for your secondary weapon or replacing your secondary weapon with a primary one. Attachments \u2014 Items that go on your primary and secondary weapons. These include scopes, silencers, grenade launchers, heartbeat detectors, and so on. Specialist \u2014 Games in the Black Ops series allow you to play as a \"Specialist\", which is a set character with specific abilities.

By default, you can aim down sights (ADS) by pressing the left trigger (consoles) or holding down the right mouse button (PC).

Exceptions to the one-shot kill rule include Black Ops 3 and Infinite Warfare, as these games both use your primary weapon's stock as a melee weapon. Some games, such as Black Ops 3 and Advanced Warfare, use a punching animation instead of the knife."

It's important to reload whenever you have enough time to do so; even if you only used a couple of bullets, reloading will ensure that you have a full magazine for your next encounter. The exception to this rule is if you're in an area with a large number of enemies. If you have enough bullets in your gun's magazine to take on one or two more people, it may make more sense to do so before reloading; you can always switch to your secondary if another enemy comes around the corner before you finish your reload. Guns such as LMGs (light machine guns), sniper rifles, and shotguns typically have high reload times, so it's best to reload these in cover rather than on the go."

When playing objective-based games like Search and Destroy, you'll want to make sure that you're not just treating it like an iteration of Team Deathmatch. Kills aren't always the only end goal."

A good rule of thumb is to reload after every engagement. For example, if you kill two enemies and you know a few more are coming, duck back into cover and reload before proceeding. Spraying through your entire magazine by holding down the trigger isn't recommended, as doing so is both inaccurate and wasteful. Try tapping the trigger to fire in bursts."

There are a few key points to help get you started in Nazi Zombies mode:\nUse your knife for the first few rounds. Ammo is invaluable, and you can kill zombies in one or two strikes with the knife during the initial rounds. Go for headshots. Zombies can soak up a huge amount of body damage unless you have an exceptionally powerful weapon (e.g., the Ray Gun). Run away if you get hit once. Zombies can down you by hitting you more than once, so let your health recharge before re-engaging the zombies. Don't skip the upgrades. Buying weapons, upgrading them via the Pack-a-Punch machine, and purchasing drinkable buffs will all help you survive for longer. Avoid getting cornered. It's better to kite zombies around the map by running in circles than to get stuck in between a burning car and a mob of the undead."

Completing Spec Ops missions in a certain amount of time will unlock more missions. There's no specific strategy for Spec Ops since each mission is different. In Modern Warfare 2, speed-running Spec Ops missions when possible is often more viable than slowly inching your way through them.
