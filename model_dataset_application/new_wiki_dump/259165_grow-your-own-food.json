Make sure they are planted after the threat of frost is over.Tip: Legumes do well in a temperate rainforest and are a great source of protein. Lettuce, cabbage, kale, and tomatoes are all great options to plant in the summer."

          "description":"Most fruit, like apples, oranges, lemons, and limes can be grown on trees in a 12,000 square feet (1,100 m) area. Start with planting a fruit tree in a pot to monitor the soil and water intake, and then transfer it to the ground after 1 year during the early spring. Most fruit trees will not start bearing fruit until they are 2 to 3 years old. Vine fruits, like grapes, can be grown anywhere with a trellis that they can climb."

          "description":"If you live in an area that gets below freezing and has a lot of precipitation, plant grains like rye. Rye is able to withstand the cold temperatures and the heavy rainfall that will happen in many areas of the world. Plant your rye in the early fall before the first frost hits. Winter grains will usually give a higher crop yield than summer grains."

Corn does especially well in the midwest area of the United States. Rice needs a tropical climate to grow. Southeast Asia is the best climate for rice crops."

Plant root vegetables in July or August to prepare for a fall harvest. You can grow these even if the threat of frost is near, since they are hearty enough to withstand it."
