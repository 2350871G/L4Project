  "text":" Using a Paper Bag Get a paper bag. Brown paper bags are perfect for ripening peaches. The fruit releases ethylene gas naturally, and the thin paper traps the gas without also trapping moisture. Plastic bags on the other hand, cause peaches to ripen too quickly and then rot. Add your fruit to the bag. Place the unripe peaches into the bag. For added ripening powers, place a banana or apple into the bag with the peaches. These fruits give off high levels of ethylene gas and will cause the peaches to ripen faster. Let the peaches ripen. Leave the bag in a dry area at room temperature for 24 hours. The number of peaches and the original ripeness will determine the total amount of time to ripen the peaches fully. Check the peaches. After 24 hours, check your peaches to see how ripe they are. If they give off a soft scent and are slightly soft to the touch, then they are ripe and ready to eat. If not, then replace them in the bag for an additional 24 hours. Repeat this process until they are ready. If they are not ripened, leave in for another 12-24 hours. Enjoy your peaches. Once all your peaches are ripened, they are ready to eat! They are good stored at room temperature for several days, but can be kept longer when placed in the fridge. Using Linen Cloth Lay out a linen napkin. Select a clean, dry area (such as a space on your kitchen counter) to lay out a linen or cotton napkin. Make sure that it is flat for optimum use of space. Lay out your peaches. Place your peaches stem-end down on the linen towel. Spread them out so that they are equidistant from each other, and so none of them are touching (even if you are ripening many peaches). Cover the peaches. Place a second linen or cotton towel over the top of the peaches. Cover them completely, and if possible tuck the sides so that the edges are closed off to fresh air. Wait for them to ripen. Ripening your peaches with a linen towel may take several days, but will provide juicier fruit. Check your peaches 2-3 days later, paying attention to their softness and looking for that classic peachy smell. If they aren't quite ready, replace the towel and check back a day later.
