Most vegetables grow well in a variety of different climates, but it's a good idea to learn what grows best in your region's garden zone before deciding what to plant. Choose vegetables that can be harvested at different times. This way, you'll have produce all summer instead of all at once. Some plants don't grow well in certain regions. Find out if the vegetables you want to grow require a cold snap to get started, or if they'll wither and die when the temperature gets too hot. You might have to be selective about what you grow if you live in a climate with very short summers or an area that doesn't get much water. Choose plants with similar growing and soil conditions to make it easier to care for your vegetable garden."

Avoid areas that are shaded by your house or a tree during part of the day. Choose a spot with good drainage and rich soil. You determine if an area has good drainage by checking it after a heavy rain. If a puddle forms, that area is probably not suitable for a vegetable garden. If the water seeps into the soil quickly, it should be fine. Choose a flat area without roots and rocks. This will be much easier to till the soil to prepare the garden for planting. If your soil doesn't have good drainage, you can create a raised bed which allows plants to grow above ground level. Some vegetables grow well in large pots, too. If you don't have a yard, peppers, tomatoes and potatoes can all be grown in pots on a patio or fire escape."

Figure out how much space you will need for the plants. You need to know how much space to leave between the seeds or seedlings you plant, as well as how much space the mature plants will take up. Squash, zucchini and pumpkins  take up a lot of space and produce a lot of fruit, while potatoes, carrots and lettuces stay relatively contained. Planting vegetables in rows helps you keep track of which plants are which. Factor in extra space between the rows to allow you to walk into the garden to weed, fertilize, and water it, as well as to harvest ripe vegetables."

Nurseries have good selections of seeds and seedlings and staff who can help you decide which varieties to buy. Fertilizer. A good natural fertilizer will boost your vegetable plants. Work bone meal, blood meal or fertilizer into the soil. Compost works well. Mulch and topsoil. Vegetable plants need to be protected from wind and heavy rain when first planted.

Use the soil tiller, hoe or rake to break up the soil into small pieces, working it to a depth of about 12 inches (30.5 cm), depending on how deep your vegetables need to be planted. Work fertilizer into the soil with a garden rake. Be sure to distribute it evenly. Be sure to take the time to remove large rocks buried in the dirt. They'll get in the way of your plants' roots, and it's worth taking the time to clear the area. If you're concerned about the quality of the dirt in your yard, buy a soil testing kit to find out how many nutrients and organic matter it contains, as well as its pH level. All of these factors affect the nutrition and growth rate of your vegetables. After you've tested the soil, you can add whatever it might be missing."
