If you are trying to remove folds from a large curtain, you may need to work in sections, moving the section on to the flat surface to remove the folds. You may lay down a piece of cardboard or a clean towel underneath the curtain to protect the surface from heat if you are concerned about damaging the surface.

Holding it \u00bd - 1 inch from the curtain should be close enough for the heat to straighten out the folds. Run the hair dryer or iron over the folds slowly in small circular motions. Let the dryer hover over the fold for a few seconds, shaking the hair dryer or iron slightly. This will let the hot air disperse over the vinyl without burning it."

It may take a few minutes for the fold to straighten out so be patient and work slowly. You may place your hand on the fold lightly to check that the curtain is not too hot or sticky as you remove the folds.
