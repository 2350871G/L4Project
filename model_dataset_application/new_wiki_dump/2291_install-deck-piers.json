Be careful to center the hole on the position for the pier. Specification for distance between piers can be found in most books about deck construction. These holes are one foot square and one foot deep. The existing ground around the hole should be undisturbed as it provides the lateral support for the post. Poor positioning of the hole will result in a larger hole and less support. This is the completed hole. Note the sides are vertical and the bottom is flat. Fill the bottom with about one inch of gravel, sand or pea gravel. This will allow you to create a flat level surface to place the paver on. It also absorbs some of the expansion and contraction that characterizes some soils. Compact the gravel at the bottom of the hole. This is important to prevent the weight of the deck from pushing the piers down and creating sags in the deck. Place the paver in the bottom of the hole and check for level by placing a post with square cut ends on the paver. Then check the level in both directions on the posts top. You may also use a small 12\" level on the paver. If it is not level, add more gravel or sand and re-compact. Once the paver is level in all directions it is time to determine the pier length.
