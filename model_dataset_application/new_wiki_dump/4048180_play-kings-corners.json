Otherwise, a player can discard cards onto any of the foundation piles on the table:\nTo discard onto any pile, the discarded card must be the opposite color of the top card, and it must be one number smaller. The sequence of cards in the game is king, queen, jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, ace. So, for instance, on a black king, you could only place a red queen. On a red five, you can only place a black four. On a red two, you can place a black ace. When a player discards on top of a foundation pile, make sure the cards overlap so all the cards underneath can still be seen. If the last (or only) card in a foundation pile is an ace, nothing can be played on this card: the pile can only be merged with another pile."

          "description":"Any player (when it\u2019s that player\u2019s turn) can merge piles on the table if the cards complete the sequence. Once a foundation pile has been moved, the player who moved it can fill the empty space with any card or card sequence from their hand. To merge piles, they must match the red-black alternation, and the pile on top must complete the numeric sequence. For instance, if you have a foundation pile containing a six, five, and four, you can place those cards (in that sequence) on top of another foundation pile with a seven as the top card, as long as the seven and six from the separate piles are opposite colors. When a pile is completed and contains all the cards from king to ace, that pile can be shuffled back into the deck in the center."

Always remember to pick up one card at the beginning of each turn. Player two is to the left of player one, so that the game is played in a clockwise direction. When it\u2019s any player\u2019s turn, if they cannot discard after drawing from the deck, play passes on to the next player. When the center deck runs out, continue playing without drawing cards."
