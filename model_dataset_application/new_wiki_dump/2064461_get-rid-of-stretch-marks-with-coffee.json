      "headline":"Mix the coffee grounds with aloe vera gel.",
      "description":"Mixing the grounds with aloe vera will yield a thick paste consistency that will help you spread the coffee grounds onto your stretch marks. Aloe vera also contains vitamins C and E, as well as other nutrients that can moisturize your skin and encourage the stretch marks to fade. Exact proportions are not important when mixing the coffee grounds and aloe vera. Aim to use just enough aloe vera to hold the coffee grounds together in a paste. Aloe vera gel can be purchased in the skin care section of most grocery stores. It can also be harvested by slicing open the plant's leaves if you grow aloe vera as a houseplant."

    {
      "headline":"Apply the coffee and aloe vera paste to your skin.",
      "description":"Ideally, your skin should be cleaned before applying the mixture. Use your fingers to spread the coffee paste onto your stretch marks, rubbing it in to ensure adequate coverage. Allow the mixture to remain on your skin for about 20 minutes."

      "headline":"Wipe the coffee paste away with a damp cloth.",
