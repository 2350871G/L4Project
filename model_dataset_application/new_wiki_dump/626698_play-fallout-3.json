      "description":"You can be either good, bad, or neutral. Playing as a good character doesn't mean you have to be a saint; look for a way to swipe a nice flamer from the Brotherhood of Steel, or all those credits the caravan heads carry? If you see them while you're exploring the wasteland, tail them for a while. Chances are they'll get into a fight or two. While they can hold their own for a while, eventually they'll be overtaken. Now's your chance to swoop in and take the pickings from their fresh corpses with no loss of karma. Hey, life is tough in the wasteland, and even the holiest of the holy would do the same to you. Just remember, they won't be using it anymore, anyway. Note that if a trader falls, this also means the caravan will no longer be accessible in the wasteland. Oh, and don't forget to grab the trader's key and loot his Brahman...all in the name of survival, of course."

If they're in your field of vision, V.A.T.S. will detect them. Remember that you score an automatic critical for massive damage if you can hit an opponent without them sensing your presence."

You can also conserve ammo by using bats, sledge hammers, shish kebabs, and other melee weapons when you're close to easy or wounded opponents."
