Plastic cups or toilet paper rolls can be cut into 2 inch (5.1 cm) strips and placed around tender young plants to protect them from these pests. Another way to avoid cutworms is to use sterile soil to start your seedlings. This helps prevent any pests that overwintered in your garden from eating your baby plants."

Handpicking is a good way to get rid of these caterpillars. Drop the hornworms into a cup or jar that contains soapy water, which will kill them. Those that don\u2019t run around their garden barefoot may prefer to squash these pests underfoot. Gardeners that have an aversion to either method can instead dump any caterpillars they find into the garbage bin."

Premade row covers can be bought at garden centers, but gardeners can make their own. All you have to do is stick hoops into the ground and cover them with either perforated plastic or fabric sheeting. These materials should let in both sun and air but also serve as a barrier for most bugs. It\u2019s a good idea to weigh down row covers on one end using bricks, wood planks, or other sufficiently heavy materials."

Mix it up according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and spray the plants thoroughly, covering the tops and bottoms of the leaves as well as the stems. It can be sprayed on flowers and landscape plants every three to five days until the caterpillars are under control. Gardeners who cannot find BT should try Neem based sprays instead. These sprays should only be used as a last resort because a number of beneficial insects may perish along with the caterpillars."
