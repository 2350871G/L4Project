  "text":" Building a Simple Raft Gather your simple supplies. You'll need tape and 10 straws. It's best if the tape is waterproof. Put the 10 straws long side by long side, forming a rectangle.  Carefully tear off a piece of tape a little longer than the width of the rectangle. Put it down on the middle of the straws, sticking them all together. Flip it around and fold over the tape ends sticking out. Put your new raft gently onto a tub of water. It should float. If it does, you're done! If not, proceed to the next step. Take another supply: aluminum foil or tinfoil. Tape a sheet of it to the bottom of your raft and a little bit up around the edges. Your raft is complete! Crafting a Simple Sailboat Make a simple raft from method one.  Put a straw through the 2 straws in the center. This may be hard, but it should work out. Reinforce the straw mast. Do this by taping the mast around the base to make it stay up straight. Cut out a piece of white paper a bit smaller than your base raft.

Put your new raft gently onto a tub of water. If it works, done! If not, tape a sheet of aluminum foil or tin foil to the bottom of your raft and a little bit up around the edges. Creating the Egyptian Sailor Make a simple sailboat from the last method.  Make a deck. Gather more straws, paper, and scissors. Take a sheet of paper and make a cube. This will be the base of your deck. Take your \"deck\" and cut a tiny square out of it. This is your door. Tape it down somewhere in the middle of your boat somewhere.  Make two castles 'castle'. Castles are like passenger seats. Cut a cube, but leave off one side. Tape your \"castles\" down on either side of the boat.  Use your scissors to cut a tiny design out of the sides. If you want to do it before you tape it down, that's fine, too. Create oars. Cut a small length of straw and tape it to the side of your raft. Repeat about 3 times, then repeat it on the other side. Test it in water. If it floats, you're good! If it doesn't float, tape a sheet of aluminum foil or tin foil to the bottom of your raft and a little bit up around the edges. Designing the Ultimate Ship Make an Egyptian Sailor (method above) with only one castle and no oars.  Use a piece of paper and cut out a long rectangle. You'll use this to make a crow's nest. Just fold it around and tape it. Cut a circle bigger than the bottom of the nest and tape it at the bottom. Then cut a small square out of the side, but don't cut the last side. Tape it to the mast, the door should be facing outwards.  Make a ladder up to the crow's nest: Cut a long piece of paper long enough to reach from the bottom of your ship to the door of the crow's nest. Fold it into a tiny square by folding it over again and again and again and again. Once you've got the thick square, snip two tiny rectangles into it. Be careful, you don't you may accidentally snip the ladder rungs apart. Unfold the ladder carefully. It should be a long ladder patterned thing. Tape one end of it to the bottom of the ship, and the other end to the crow's nest, just beneath the door. Test it in water. If it floats, you're good! If it doesn't float, tape a sheet of aluminum foil or tinfoil to the bottom of your raft and a little bit up around the edges. Try an optional addition: Use the mast technique from above to put in a small piece of straw at the castle-less front of the boat. Cut a circle and tape it onto the top of the straw. This is your steering wheel. Cut a tiny slit in the straw. Then, cut a piece of paper big enough for a table. Fold the straw back a little, exposing the slit. Put in the paper and let go of the straw. Holding a Straw Ship Race Invite 2 or more friends over to your house or bring a tub filled with water to a park.  Gather supplies and have everyone make a simple sailboat, an Egyptian sailor, or an ultimate ship. If anyone wants, they can add variations too. Have everyone take a piece of paper and fold it to make a paper fan. Search up how to make one. Have everyone help you make a racetrack by creating some kind of long container and pouring water into it.
