This genetic code will give you more DNA points popping blue bubbles or is also known as cure. During the game, researchers will frantically look for a way to cure the virus you unleashed, sending groups of people to other countries to uncover the secret in order to eradicate the worm. Whenever there are researchers, blue bottles will appear. Catalytic Switch is very effective during the middle and later part of the game."

Most of the countries have ports, especially countries that are difficult to infect such as Greenland and Iceland. With this gene, infection spreads through water; this includes ships and will be more effective than normal."

This increases the chance of your plague mutating and will be helpful since you will be focusing on spreading the worm later on. You can also use Genetic Mimic; this gene makes your plague harder to cure. The chance of mutating doesn't require DNA points."

Choosing a rich country will delay the generation of your DNA points, which will affect the outcome of the game. It's advisable that you choose India as your starting country because of its warm temperature; it's granted that your Neurax is used to hot climate. Furthermore, having China as a neighboring country will boost up the spreading of your Neurax once it crosses the border."

The egg will make Neurax Worm produce eggs, which will eject from the host brain in the thousands. This is effective in crowded countries such as China. This will also unlock the three key transmissions in this mode. Upgrade each: Bird 1, Insect 1, and Rodent 1 to have the Neurax travel in different living creatures to hasten the infectivity."

This will unlock Undulatory Locomotion. Undulatory Locomotion has the ability to propagate flexural waves along the length of worm, increasing the infectiousness. If you have enough DNA points, evolve Undulatory Locomotion after Concertina."

The Neurax will start spreading to other nations, and the number of people infected grows. If you don't have DNA points at this time, go back to the game and pop bubbles. Once you have enough points, evolve the Air and Water gene. Air can make your worm dehydrate to become lighter, allowing them to float in the wind, which is useful in countries with arid condition. This also invades planes, which can help the migrate to other country. Water gene makes your Neurax develop flexible cell membranes, allowing them to survive at a range of depths. This also affects people's water, infecting them if they drink straight from the tap. Effective in poor countries."

Now that we have spread to other countries, it is best to strengthen Neurax by evolving the Drug Resistance 1. Your worm will become resistant to class 1 and class 2 drugs, increasing the ineffectiveness of the drugs in wealthy countries. If you have enough DNA points, evolve Cold Resistance 1 and Cold Resistance 2. Since our Neurax is already used to hot climate, it's ideal to focus on Cold Resistance instead of Heat Resistance.

If you still have enough DNA at this point, go back to Abilities and evolve the Drug Resistance 2 and then return to your game and watch the Neurax spread across the country.
