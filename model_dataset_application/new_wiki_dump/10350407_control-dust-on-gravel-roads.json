You can use a handheld liquid sprayer to cover your gravel road with water. If you have a long enough hose, you can attach it to an outdoor water faucet and spray the road. You can also alter the direction of your sprinkler heads to periodically cover the road with water."

          "description":"Wind adds to your dust problems by blowing around the dust and depositing it in unwanted places. You can put up a fence or a wall of shrubs along the side of the road to act as a windbreak. For maximum protection, you'll want to install a windbreak on both sides of your road. If you're only building 1 windbreak, place it on the side of the road that is closest to your home to reduce the amount of dust coming toward your house. Picket and board fences work well for this purpose."

          "description":"The amount of dust released from the road has a direct correlation to how fast you drive on it. Driving slow will prevent the potholes from getting worse and will also reduce the amount of dust released from the road. Though it might be inconvenient on longer stretches of road, any reduction in speed will help keep the dust down."

For a road that was treated the previous year, you'll want to get .5 pounds (0.23 kg) of calcium chloride for every 1 square yard (0.84 m). It is recommended to buy calcium chloride flakes for better storage and easier mixing."
