Because yams have a thicker consistency than water or broth, the more cubed yams you add, the creamier the soup will be. For creamy soup, yams go well with coconut oil, carrots, ginger, and garlic. For a chunky stew with a base that has a broth consistency, try stew meat and chopped onions, tomato, and bell peppers."
