      "description":"Taking the UK maximum height of 60m, 200 feet, we need to do some calculations. A kite doesn't fly vertical, so to get a kite 60m or 200 feet into the air you will need to let out, say around 80m, 262 feet of line. 80m, 262 feet of wire, makes for a good antenna on 1.9 mhz or 3.5 mhz. The antenna will also work on 7 mhz but you will require an antenna matching unit. Look for lightweight but strong wire. Many electronic shops do large reels on single colour wire around 100m per roll \"equipment wire\". Be aware that some insulated wire is more prone to building up static charges than others. For example, kynar insulated wire wrapping wire picks up static very quickly. Surplus antenna wire, which consists of braided copper around a steel core, works much better and does not build up nearly as much static. Get an earth rod. This is very important as voltages may be induced on the wire you are flying, and these need to be discharged safely to ground. You can pick up an earth rod from a DIY store. It is recommended that you use of either an RF choke or a high value resistor (100k, for example) from the random wire input to the ground. This should be connected BEFORE launching the kite. Static can build up on the line very rapidly. You will need some incidentals, such as a hammer to bang in the earth rod, a bungee cord and a couple of climbing style carabiners. The carabiners are used to attach the kite line to the kite, and also to get the kite down at the end of the day."

      "description":"As earlier stated, you should not fly your kite close to an airfield or in a busy residential area but this article assumes you have a nice suitable location in mind. Lay out the kite, and run out the control line to its full extent. Do the following to prepare the kite and antenna for flight:\nBeside this, run out the wire antenna. The wire antenna should be a good 5 to 10 meters ( longer than the control wire. Do NOT connect the wire antenna directly to the control line as this can cause the line to fail. The two lines should be separate; it is recommended that you use a small length of rope on the kite before attaching the wire antenna. Secure the main control line to the ground. You won't be able to hold the kite because these kites pull far too much, so you need to locate a suitable fence or tree. You can use a ground stake, but these are not always strong enough and you won't be able to pull a tree out of the ground... hopefully. Put the earth rod into the ground. In the first instance, attach the wire antenna to the earth rod. Use the RF choke or a high value resistor from the random wire input to the ground. Have the battery and radio and matching unit close to the earth rod. At this point, you should be ready to go. Check once again that the weather is OK, with no lighting forecast."
