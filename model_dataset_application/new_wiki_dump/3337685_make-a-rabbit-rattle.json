  "text":" Preparing the Felt Pieces Cut the felt fabric as follows: Cut two oval pieces for the rabbit's head (front and back). While the diameter is up to you, a reasonable size would be about 10cm/4 inches. Cut out two small circles for the cheeks. Cut out ear pieces proportional to the head size. You'll need four larger ear pieces (front and back) and two smaller pieces of the same shape for the inner ears (front only). Sew the face on one of the head pieces as follows: Stitch the cheek pieces in place at an even distance across from each other. Embroider eyes, nose and mouth as shown in the image. Making the Ears Sew the inner ears to the front ear pieces.  Sew each of the ears together. Stitch around the edges of the front and back pieces to join each ear. Leave the bottom straight edges open. Stuff quilt wadding or other stuffing into the ears to give them their shape.  Attaching Ears and Making the Handle Arch Stitch the rabbit's head together. Sew along the edges of the head, leaving a small opening for the stuffing. Add the stuffing until firm. Finish stitching. Sew the ears to the top of the rabbit's head.  Make an arch shape. Cut out an arch shape from the felt in the same size as the hoop handle piece. You'll need both front and back pieces and they must completely loop around the hoop handle piece. Sew the arch together topside (the longer edge) only. Double check that it slips over the hoop handle piece once stitched. Sew two hearts on the arched piece as decoration. Adding the Hoop Handle Wrap one side of the hoop handle piece with the arched felt. Secure it by sewing the inner arch side of arched felt around the hoop. Glue the completed rabbit's head onto the wrapped plastic hoop with hot glue. Done. The baby's rattle is now ready for use.",
