If you use things that could peel off, like glitter or glued-on paper, brush a thin layer of decoupage medium over it and let it dry completely before using. This will prevent the decorations from coming off. Avoid adding anything that\u2019s too bulky to the middle of the bookmark since it will affect how the bookmark sits in your book. If you want to use something like pom poms or chunky rhinestones, for instance, attach them to the outside edges instead."

Folding an Origami Heart Bookmark Fold the paper in half horizontally, unfold it, then fold it vertically. Use a square piece of paper in any size. Align the bottom edge with the top edge and make a crease. Then unfold the paper and align the left edge with the right edge. Crease the fold before opening the paper back up.

Fold the bottom edge up to the middle crease, then flip the paper over. Pull the bottom edge of the paper up so that it aligns with the center crease. Run your finger along the fold to crease it before flipping the paper over onto the other side. Take your time and line up the edge with the middle crease as perfectly as possible. Sloppy folds can ruin the project. Bring the bottom corners in to the middle vertical crease. Fold up the left and right corners so that the bottom edges line up with the crease in the center of the paper. Crease them securely to hold them in place. Avoid overlapping the edges in the middle or leaving a space between them. Try to get them to rest against each other. Flip the paper over, fold the bottom corner up to the top edge, then turn it back over. Turn the paper over onto the other side. Then, take the corner at the bottom and bring it up so that it meets the flat edge at the top. Crease the fold and then flip the paper back over. Don\u2019t let the tip go past the top edge of the paper or your finished heart won\u2019t look right. Open the left and right flaps at the bottom edge and flatten them down. Find the 2 flaps in the center of the paper along the bottom. Place your index finger inside 1 flap to open it, then press down to flatten it into a triangle shape. Repeat with the other flap. Make sure the crease in the center of the flattened triangle lines up with the bottom edge of the paper and that the 2 tips of the flattened triangles point towards each other. Fold the 2 square corners of the opened flaps up to meet the bottom edge. Find the small squares at the bottom edge of the paper that were created when you flattened the flaps. Take these corners and fold them up to the bottom edge of the paper to create small triangles with the tips pointing down. For example, on the right flattened flap, fold the outer right corner up and in. On the left, fold the outermost left corner up and in. Fold the bottom tips of the 2 triangles up about \u20444 inch (0.64 cm). To round out what will be the top curves of the heart, take the 2 tips of the small triangles that are pointing down away from the paper. Fold them up slightly and crease them to stay in place. You can fold the tips up more or less than \u20444 inch (0.64 cm), depending on how you want to shape your heart. For instance, folding them up less will make the arches pointier, while folding them up more will make the arches flatter. Bring the left and right edges in to line up with the middle crease. Fold the 2 outer edges of the paper in so that they align perfectly with the crease in the center. Then, press down firmly to crease the 2 folds. Avoid folding in the heart shape, created by flattening the flaps and folding them into triangles, during this step. Flip the paper over to see your finished bookmark! To use it, simply slip the page you want to mark underneath the bottom point of the heart.",
