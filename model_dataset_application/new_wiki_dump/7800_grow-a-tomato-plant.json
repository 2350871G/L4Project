This is also a method to consider if you want a large yield of fruit. You\u2019ll have to find a spot that receives 6 to 8 hours of sunlight each day. If soil-borne diseases break out, you\u2019ll have a difficult time sterilizing the entire area or replacing the soil. These gardens are more vulnerable to moles, gophers, birds, squirrels, and deer."

          "description":"This is a great option if you\u2019re concerned about pollutants in your soil. You could even replace the soil if disease breaks out or if necessary. The non-compact soil allows for better drainage and aeration than in-ground gardens. If you suffer from back or leg pain, you have the advantage of not having to bend over as much. As for disadvantages, you\u2019ll have to leave enough space between beds for efficient maintenance and harvesting. You\u2019ll also have to pay up front for materials, such as untreated lumber and soil. Raised beds also dry out faster than planting in the ground."

          "description":"Some containers are more portable than others. They\u2019re great if you don\u2019t have much yard space. However, they require more frequent watering, since the soil dries out quickly. You\u2019ll also need to invest in additional support structures if you live in a climate that gets high winds. Some popular forms of containers are:\nUpcycled buckets are cheap and easy to acquire. They\u2019re usually lightweight enough to transport, but you have to drill your own drainage holes. Dark plastic can overheat and leach toxic chemicals into the soil. Metal buckets can rust and stain your patio or deck. Barrels are attractive and provide enough space for roots to flourish. Just keep in mind that they\u2019re difficult to move and will eventually rot. You\u2019ll also have to drill your own drainage holes."

They also need strong hardware to anchor them in place. Hanging baskets can be adapted to upper-story apartments by hanging them from the window sill. Just keep in mind that your options will be limited to small varieties like cherry tomatoes. Upside-down planters can be made from upcycled buckets. In this state, tomato plants don\u2019t need to be staked. Birds are less likely to pick at tomatoes because they have nowhere to perch.

You'll need about 5 to 8 pounds per square foot (25 to 40 kilograms per square meter). Turn compost into the top 3 inches (6 to 8 cm). Before setting your seedling or plant in the soil, toss a couple handfuls of organic material or egg shells in the bottom of your planting hole.

If your soil tests above 6.8, water your tomatoes with a mixture of equal parts cold coffee and water. You could also add a mulch pf pine needles.

Make sure to trim off the lower leaves of the plant and do not bury them. If you bury them then they will rot. When removing the plants from their pots, tap the bottom of the pot and try to get the roots and soil all in one piece. This is important because ripping the roots apart could damage the plant."

A cage should be at least 48 inches (1.2 m) tall. Cages can bend if the plants get heavy and sometimes collapse in summer storms. Remove leaves and secondary stems as the plant grows. A stake should be at least 0.5 x 2 inches (1.3 x 5 cm) wide and 6 to 8 feet (1.8 to 2.4 meters) long. Pound stakes about 12 to 24 inches (30 cm to 60 cm) deep, at least 2 inches (5 cm) away from the plant.

Drip or soaker hose watering aimed at the roots is better than overhead watering, which can encourage diseases. To prevent mold or fungal diseases, water plants in the morning. Water less frequently after 10 days. Ensure plants are receiving 1 to 3 inches (2.5 cm to 7.6 cm) of rain weekly. If not, give each plant about 2 gallons (about 7.5 L) per plant per week, beginning by about the end of the second week after transplanting.

Use half the recommended concentration of chemical fertilizer per gallon/liter (using package directions). Do not use lawn fertilizer. The ratio of minerals in lawn fertilizer is for growing stems and leaves. Over-fertilization can cause plants to grow too quickly, leaving them more susceptible to disease and insects."
