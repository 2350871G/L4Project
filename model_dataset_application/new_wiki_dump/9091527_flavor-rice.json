However, keep in mind rice is sometimes used to cool down your mouth when eating something spicy. Use a salsa that's slightly more mild than the dish you're making so the rice isn't overwhelming. If you're making a very spicy dish, use something like carrot juice instead of salsa. This way, your rice will have a savory flavor to match without being too hot."

The flavor will seep into the rice during the cooking process, creating a rich built-in flavor for your rice. You can also add in herbs or spices that pair well with the vegetables you're adding. For example, add in some freshly minced garlic alongside diced onions."
