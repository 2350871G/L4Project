Wire 1 terminal of your system's transformer to the appropriate thermostat. Connect the other side of the thermostat to the first terminal of the zone valve operator.

Connect a wire from the zone valve operator's second terminal to 1 of the boiler's \"T\" terminals.  Wire the third terminal of the zone valve to the other \"T\" terminal.
