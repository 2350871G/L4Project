If you're playing Pok\u00e9mon Red, Blue, Yellow, or Green, you'll need to transfer to Gold, Silver, or Crystal in order to be able to evolve Chansey.

In order to evolve Chansey, you will need to raise its Friendship level to at least 220 (255 is the max).

      "description":"Determining Chansey's Friendship level is a little difficult, as you can't see the numbers anywhere in the game. Instead, you'll need to talk to a specific person and use the phrase they say to determine Chansey's Friendship level. When checking Friendship, make sure Chansey is the first Pok\u00e9mon in your party. The phrase listed below will indicate that your Chansey has a Friendship level of about 200-250. Generation II: Talk to the woman near the Bike Shop in Goldenrod City. \"I get the feeling that it really trusts you.\" This is the same for HeartGold and SoulSilver. Generation III: Find the house in Verdanturf with a woman and a Pikachu. Talk to the woman to determine your Friendship level. \"It seems to be very happy. It obviously likes you a whole lot.\" This is also the same for Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby. In FireRed and LeafGreen, talk to Daisy in Pallet Town. \"It looks very happy. I wish Rival could see this and learn something from it.\" Generation IV: Talk to the Beauty in the Pok\u00e9mon Fan Club in Hearthome city, or talk to Dr. Footstep south of the Pastoria City entrance. \"I get the feeling that it really trusts you.\" (Diamond and Pearl). \"It's very friendly toward you. I can tell you treat it kindly.\" (Platinum)\nGeneration V: Talk to the woman in the Pok\u00e9mon Fan club in Icirrus City. \"It is quite friendly to you! You must be a kind person!\". In Black 2 and White 2, you can call Bianca. \"You two sure get along great! It looks like you are having fun together! You seem bright and cheerful!\" Generation VI: Talk to the Pok\u00e9mon Breeder at the Pok\u00e9mon Fan Club in Laverre City. \"You must really like your Chansey and always keep it by your side!\" Generation VII: Talk to the woman near the TM shop in Konikoni City. \"You clearly love your Chansey, and you must spend a lot of time together.\""
