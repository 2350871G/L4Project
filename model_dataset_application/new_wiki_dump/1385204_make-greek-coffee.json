The type of bean, the roast, and the grind all contribute to the unique flavor of Greek coffee. Two of the most popular brands of Greek coffee are Loumidis and Bravo. Greek coffee does sometimes use dark-roasted beans, but a light roast is more common."

It\u2019s usually an hourglass- or cauldron-shaped metal pot with a long handle. Greek coffee is made right in the briki, which is warmed over a gas stove. You can heat a briki on an electric range as well, though Greek coffee is traditionally made on a gas stove or over an open flame. If you want to make traditional Greek coffee but don\u2019t have a gas stove, you can use a small single-burner camp stove as well. A briki comes in many different sizes, and you should use the correct size for the amount of coffee you're making."

Do not stir, swirl, or otherwise disturb the coffee at this point, or you will destroy the foam, which is an integral part of Greek coffee.
