          "description":"Lemongrass can be grown from seeds for very little money and with very little supplies, most of which can be found right near your home. The best time to begin growing is mid-February to early March, however, with the right care, you can grow them any time of year. Stop at a garden store to find a 1-gallon container for every plant you\u2019d like to grow, as well as sterilized seed starting mix, potting soil, and several seed starting trays with plastic domes - plastic bags also can work as a substitute. Seeds are sometimes harder to find at garden stores, but you can also buy them online at multiple nurseries. If your seeds will not be constantly at least 70 degrees while they are germinating, consider buying a seedling heat mat as well to help nurture your seeds at a constant temperature as they grow."

          "description":"At this stage, the seeds are too fragile and vulnerable to go directly into soil, so you need to give them 1\u20132 weeks in a dark, warm place to sprout by tending to them very carefully. This is easier in a warm environment, but it\u2019s possible to do in a colder place as well. Put your seed starting mix into your seedling trays, inserting them about \u00bc of an inch deep. Place the domes, or your plastic bags, over the seeds so they are covered. If the area around the seeds is cold, place your seedling heat mat beneath the trays. Spritz the seeds with water daily, keeping them moist but not wet, replacing the dome or plastic bag each time. When green seedlings appear from the seeds, remove the dome or bag from the trays and move them into full sunlight."

          "description":"Seedlings need more room and nutrients in order to grow into stalks, and each will need their own 1 gallon container to do this properly. So when your seedlings are roughly 6 inches long, it\u2019s time to transplant! Fill each of your 1 gallon containers with 1 gallon of rich, well draining soil. If you purchased fertilizer, mix a \u00bd cup of this with your soil before filling your container. Move each seedling to its own pot, placing it roughly a \u00bc of an inch down into the soil. Water your plants at least 2 or 3 times every week, or a few times more if the weather is over 80 degrees and the soil feels dry like sand."

Stop by any Asian market. Usually they can be found in abundance. If there isn\u2019t an Asian market in your neighborhood, a local health food store, organic grocery store, or co-op. Stop at a garden store. Purchase as many 1 gallon (3.8 L) planting pots to accommodate each stalk, potting soil, and a large jar that will comfortably fit your stalks if you don\u2019t already have one at home.

          "description":"With only some sun and a jar of water, roots will grow from the fleshy white base of the plant. It's important to grow these roots before placing your stalks into the pot, as they will help transfer nutrients to the rest of the plants, helping it grow faster and stronger. Find the spot in your house that gets the most sunlight for the longest time during the day, south facing windows are usually the best. It\u2019s helpful to observe your home at several key hours in order to determine this, including early 8 am, 12 pm, and later as the sun begins to set at 5 pm in the winter, or 7 pm in the summer. Fill up the jar with an inch or two of water and place it in the sunny spot in your home. Place the stalks into a large glass jar. Be sure to insert them with the thicker, lighter side down. into a large jar with an inch or two of water at the bottom. Change the water in the jar daily. If you skip a day or two, it won\u2019t be fatal to your plant, but be sure to change it out at least every 48 hours. Wait 1\u20132 weeks. Stalks will be ready to plant when roots at the base grow about 3 inches long, and new leaves appear at the top of the stalks."

          "description":"When it looks like the stalks are getting a bit crowded, most likely the roots of your plants are fighting for nutrients. Replanting them into a larger container or outside will help the roots of your lemongrass stretch out and absorb as many nutrients as possible. Fill a larger pot with soil, and dig a hole roughly the size of your old pot. Hold the stalks firmly in one hand, and tip the pot over to release the roots. Transfer it to the larger pot filled with soil. You can also move your plants to the ground outside using the same method. If you do so, be sure to plant them 36-60 inches apart. However, keep in mind that you should only do this if you live in a warm climate, classified Zone 7 or higher. Otherwise, you\u2019ll want to keep your plant in pots so you can move them back inside once the weather becomes too cold, or prepare to harvest them from the ground entirely."
