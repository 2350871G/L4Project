Essentially, you want to adjust your camera\u2019s settings so that it enters into a \u201csports\u201d or \u201caction\u201d mode. The number of settings you must adjust to get your camera into this mode is entirely dependent upon the quality of your camera. For smartphones, you will need to activate your camera\u2019s burst mode and/or turn on its Tracking AF setting. If you are using a point-and-shoot digital camera, you will need to manually switch your device into sports mode or action mode. If you have a DSLR camera, you will need to manually adjust your shutter priority mode, shutter speed, and its ISO setting. You will also need to turn it to a high speed shooting mode, place it in continuous focus mode, and select a suitable focus point setting."

The shutter speed dictates the length of time your shutter is open and your camera\u2019s sensor is exposed to light. While slow shutter speeds capture blurry pictures, faster shutter speeds freeze, or stop, the action and produce crisp images. Locate the labeled dial on top of your DSLR camera.
