Check the quilt for embellishments, appliques, and loose seams or lace. See if there are any highly saturated or contrasting colors, hand dying, or batiks. Quilts with embellishments shouldn\u2019t be washed in a washing machine. Loose seams should be repaired before washing the quilt. Quilts with vivid colors may bleed. Test the fabric with white cotton fabric dipped in hot water. Rub the quilt\u2019s highly saturated area and see if any color comes off. If so, use a color catcher product in the washing machine."

Hang it on a balcony or clothesline, or spread it out on the ground. If you spread it on the ground, place a bedsheet underneath it and another on top of it. Weigh the corners down. You can also air dry a quilt on a balcony by laying down a mattress pad and spreading the quilt out on top of it. If birds are a concern, spread another mattress pad on top.
