Other materials you will need are a 5\u201dx5\u201dx1/2\u201d foam sheet, glue, string, markers, tape, craft paint, a serrated knife, a silver marker/sharpie, brown construction paper, nine wooden skewers, a ruler, and a black 20\u201d x 30\u201d poster board. Use the following Styrofoam balls for the planets: 1 each of 5\u201d, 4\u201d, 3\u201d, 2.5\u201d and 2\u201d balls, and 2 1.5\u201d balls\nAdult supervision is recommended when using the knife. You\u2019ll need the following paint colors: yellow, orange, red, green, light blue, and dark blue. These materials can be purchased at any craft store or the craft department of a superstore."

          "headline":"Slice all of the foam balls in half.",
          "description":"Ask an adult for help with this step. Use the knife to cut all of the balls except one of the 1.5\u201d balls in half. It doesn\u2019t have to be exactly in half, close to half is fine. Rub the two halves together over a trash can to brush the crumbs away after cutting. Rubbing the knife with beeswax or candle wax before cutting will make it easier to slice. Squash the second 1.5\u201d ball on the table to compress it to about 1.25\u201d thick, then cut it in half."

Draw a second circle around the outside of the first circle about 1\u201d away. Use the tip of the knife to cut out the ring. Again, have an adult help with this step. Make a uniform second circle by tracing around the exterior of your 4\u201d ball."

Repeat this process with each planet\u2019s orbit, moving the pencil to each mark. Trace a dashed line on top of the pencil with the silver marker. Glue each planet somewhere on its orbit.
