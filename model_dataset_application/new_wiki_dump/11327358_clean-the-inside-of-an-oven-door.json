  "text":" Washing the Door Interior Open the oven door and wipe away loose grime. Use a damp microfiber cloth to avoid scratching the glass. Rinse the cloth in clean warm water if it becomes too dirty and is no longer wiping effectively. There's no need to use soap at this point. Make a baking soda and water paste in a medium-sized bowl. By slowly adding water to \u20442 cup (120 mL) of baking soda and stirring, you can create a whitish-looking paste. Stop adding water when the paste is about the consistency of shaving cream. Soak the paste on the oven window before wiping it away. Make sure the layer of baking soda paste on the window is even. Allow the paste to sit for 15 to 20 minutes, then wipe it away using a clean and moistened microfiber cloth. Scrape and polish the door with a razor and dry microfiber cloth. Apply the razor to scour away any remaining gunk. Make sure to use the flat edge rather than the corner of the blade, as the corner may scratch the glass. Use the cloth to buff away any remaining streaks on the glass. If you scratch the glass, put a little metal polish onto a soft, dry cloth and gently rub the scratch. Cleaning inside the Door with Wire Remove the access panel or drawer located below the oven door. To remove the drawer, pull the drawer out until it stops, then lift the front of the door until the stops clear the guides. Pull the drawer forward to fully remove it. Locate the slots below the oven door. There should be about three of them. These slots lead into the space between the two panes of glass that make up your oven door, and are typically used to promote air flow throughout the oven. Attach a moist glass cleaning wipe to a piece of coat hanger wire. The wire's flexibility will help you get to the hard-to-reach places between the door. However, be careful not to scratch the glass with the metal hanger, particularly if the cloth somehow comes loose. Slide the wire and cleaning wipe through the slots and scrub. By moving the cleaning wipe from side to side and bending the wire as necessary, you can clean the glass. To make sure you clean all of the glass, move the wire up through each of the slots in the bottom of the oven door to clean that area. Replace the access panel or oven drawer. To do this, align the drawer rails with the guides, then slide the drawer back as far as you can. Raise the drawer front and push inwards until the stops pass over the guides. Then, lower the drawer and slide it shut. Scrubbing inside the Door with a Yardstick Place a large towel on the floor. This will be used to protect the oven door when it is removed. Make sure to use a towel you are willing to get dirty, as the oven door will likely be coated in food particles, grease, and other debris. You can also place the towel on a large surface in the kitchen. Open the oven door and unlock the hinge locks. Hinge designs vary between models so consult your model's use and care manual for the exact way to do so. Typically, hinge locks are located in the front corners of the body of the oven, and can be pulled towards the door frame until they are in the unlocked position. Place the door in the removal position, lift free, and place on the towel. The removal position is when the door is open about 3 in (7.6 cm), or 75 degrees. Make sure nothing is obstructing the door, then lift the door up and out until both hinge arms are clear of the slots. For your safety, use two people for this step as the door will be heavy. Exercise caution when lifting. The door handle should be facing down and the inside window of the oven should be facing up. Prepare the cleaning solution and assemble the cleaning wand. Mix 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of mild dish soap with about 4 cups (950 mL) of warm water in a medium-sized container to make the solution. Wrap a washcloth or dishcloth soaked in the cleaning solution around the end of the yardstick to make the cleaning wand. Then secure it with tape or rubber bands. Move the yardstick inside the opening at the bottom of the oven door. Thoroughly wet and rub any stains you can see. Let the solution soak into the stains for at least two months, and rewet the cloth as necessary. Don't force the yardstick between the glass, and allow yourself plenty of room to maneuver the yardstick around. Be careful not to bend or break the glass. Rinse and dry the oven door. Soak the cloth in clean water and reattach it to the yardstick. Use the cloth to remove all the soap residue, then replace it with a paper towel. Reinsert the wrapped yardstick inside the door and soak up the remaining moisture. Let the door air dry for 1 hour. Reattach the oven door with care. Move the door to the rest of the oven and hold the door in the position in which it was removed. There should be about 3 in (7.6 cm) of space keeping the oven from being shut. Seat the left hinge arm fully inside the hinge slot, before doing the process again with the right hinge arm. Finally, lock the hinge locks, located in oven body's frame, and close the door.",
