One cup (250 mL) of milk should reach room temperature within 45 seconds and boil within two and a half minutes. Stir it every 15 seconds to keep it from boiling over. You can also try setting your microwave to 70 percent power for a slower boil. You should still stir the milk every 15 seconds."

If you\u2019re making a sauce or a glass of warm milk, set the heat to medium. To keep the milk from boiling over, don\u2019t turn your back on it and stir it every few minutes. Lower the heat when the milk starts to boil to avoid scorching it."

Eventually, the steam breaks through violently and the milk boils over the sides of the pot. Keeping a long-handled spoon gives the steam a way out before too much pressure builds. You should still put the spoon to use every few minutes and stir the milk to release steam."

When you see tiny bubbles and steam, the milk has met its boiling point of 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82 degrees Celsius). If your stove runs hot and you can\u2019t boil milk slowly enough directly over a flame, you could use the double boiler method."
