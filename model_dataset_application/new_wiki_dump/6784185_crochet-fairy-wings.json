  "text":" Part 1: Shaping the frame for the fairy wings Cut three 6 foot (1.66 meter) strands of 12-14 (1.8mm) gauge galvanized wires.  Bend the ends of two of the galvanized strips of wire around two circular objects. Suitable circular objects could be a can, pot, or bottle. Bend them so that they meet close to the middle. Both strips should form the shape of a B when aligned side by side. These two wire shapes form the frames of your fairy wings. Shape wire frame so that it comfortably supports the wearer's back.  Bend the third strip of galvanized wire to meet at both ends.  Bend one end of the wire strip folding 3 - 4 inches (8 -10cm) tightly against itself.  Use round or needle nose pliers to grasp the folded end of the wire from about 1/2 inch (2cm) to form a rounded hook shape.  Twist electrical or masking tape around the folded end of the wire to keep wire from getting caught on clothing or scratch wearer.  Grasp the other end of the wire About 1/4 inch (.75 cm) using round nose pliers.  Keep a tight grip on the pliers while holding the wire with your other hand and twist a loop.  Rotate the circular piece of wire to face the two end parts downward.  Connect the hook from one end through the eye on the other.  Tighten with flat nose pliers to close the hook firmly holding the eye loop.  Bend the circular galvanized wire strip from the center, both sides. Bend inward to shape it like an hourglass silhouette. This hourglass piece will form the wings' support frame to be attached to the back. Bend a hook on both ends of each B-shaped wing.  Connect both wings to either side of the top of the hourglass wire frame. The hooks of both wings should be latching on to the frame for the back support. Cut an 8 feet long strip of galvanized wire.  Bend the wire to connect both ends, meeting at the middle. The wire should form the shape of an \"8\". Bend both ends of the wire to form a hook and eye.  Turn the 8-shaped wire sideways. Place it in the middle of the hourglass shaped frame. Cut eight 12 inch (30cm) strips of wire that are thinner or more flexible than the frame wire.  Secure all wings to the frame with these thinner weaving wires. The wing frame is now completed. Crocheting and stitching fairy wings with yarn and clear plastic Cut the top and bottom ends off eight 2 liter (0.53 US gal) plastic bottles.  Make sleeves. Flatten two of the plastic bottles by folding both sides with a wooden dowel or flat object.These create plastic sleeves. Set aside for use shortly. Make plastic wing shapes. Cut four of the plastic bottles from one side to make four rectangular flat plastic pieces. These must be larger than the wing span created earlier. Place each rectangular plastic piece against each wing shape, overlapping to ensure that you can get the whole wing shape. Trace the edges of the wing shape onto the plastic pieces with a dry erase marker. Cut each rectangular plastic to the shape of the wings. Cut neatly and precisely. Use a hole punch to perforate the edge of the plastic wings. Punch 1/2 inch (1.75cm) from the edge, punching a hole every inch (3cm) along the perimeter of each plastic wing. Insert drawings or shiny glitter paper cut-out shapes into the sleeves of the flattened bottles you squeezed earlier (in step two).  Perforate with the hole punch along the open ends of the flattened bottle sleeves.  Stitch the edges of the flat bottle sleeves with crochet needles and yarn]]. This will enclose the paper drawing shapes. Crochet each plastic wing onto the wing frames. Knit along each perimeter hole made earlier and link firmly to the wire wing frame. Crochet or use hot glue gun to secure the decorated plastic sleeves on the surface of the wings.  Twist and tie an elastic cord to the support frame. This will tie around the wearer's shoulders and waist. Use glitter glue or stickers to add color and personal style to your fairy wings. This step is optional. Crocheting the wings with fine copper wire Select the proper wire for your crocheted fairy wings. Wire comes in many different colors, metals, thickness and hardness. For Crochet, A thin, soft, flexible wire is preferred. Look for wire thickness labeled 26, 28, or 30 Gauge. Larger gauge is more difficult to bend and work with. Here is a link to gauge comparison and conversion chart PDF if your wire has different or no labeled gauge https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wire_gauge & https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Gauge_Chart.pdf Keep wire on spool when stitching to avoid cutting too much (waste) or Not enough wire for your chain pattern. If the spool is too large you can unwind a good enough length of wire and wind it around a smaller spool or reel a loop using your finger's diameter as a guide. Cast on one end of the fine copper wire onto the first set of the wing frame.  Crotchet chain stitch 28 or 30 gauge cooper wire  Loop the copper wire around the frame wire. Crochet slip stitch from the front to the back, then back into the center of the loop. Keep looping all around the wing frame until you get back to the first loop stitch.  Loop into the copper wire's first loop.  Continue looping into the next copper wire loop.  Slowly turn the wing each time you loop into the next.  Continue the same pattern until you reach the middle of the wing.  Stitch the last loop with a spiral shaped wire, to add details.  Add beads, if wished. Embed beads or other figure shapes at random places between the thread of wire, along the loops.",
