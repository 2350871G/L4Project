          "description":"All species of phlox produce flowers in a wide range of colors including white, pink, red, lavender and blue. Different varieties serve different needs in the garden. Do some research to decide which one is right for your growing zone. Purchase potted phlox plants sold locally at garden centers or farmer's markets for transplanting any time during the growing season. Your local garden center or nursery can advise you on which species grow best in your area. Garden and meadow phlox are perfect for garden borders, since they grow quite wide and tall. Low-growing phlox varieties are perfect to use as groundcover in shady areas, especially as many are mildew-resistant. You can also buy bare-root plants from a mail order company, but bare root plants are best planted in the spring."

However, some are tolerant of partial or filtered shade. Find a location that works for the variety you have chosen. Phlox grown in the shade often produce fewer flowers. They are also at increased risk for contracting a disease, so if you choose to plant phlox in the shade, look for a variety that is mildew-resistant."

If you see standing water and puddles there, the soil doesn't have good drainage. If the area is wet, but not soaking, it should be fine for growing phlox."
