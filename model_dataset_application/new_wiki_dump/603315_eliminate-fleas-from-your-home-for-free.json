          "headline":"Isolate your pet from people and other animals.",
          "description":"If you\u2019ve noticed fleas on your pet, act quickly so that they don\u2019t spread to other animals or people. Place your pet in a bathroom, mudroom, or another space without a lot of soft surfaces where fleas can easily hide. It's best to do this in a room with a door so that your pet won't get near other animals or people. This will keep the fleas from spreading as you work on cleaning the house. Make sure your pet is comfortable. Place water and a favorite toy or blanket in their enclosed space so that they feel safe and calm. Keep your pet isolated until you have finished bathing them and cleaning the house."

        {
          "headline":"Comb your pet to get rid of their fleas.",
          "description":"Spread a sheet on the floor and have your pet sit on it. This will catch any fleas that escape the comb. Use a fine-tooth comb to go through all of your pet\u2019s hair, frequently dipping the comb into a bowl of water that contains a few drops of dish soap. The dish soap will immobilize the fleas. After you\u2019re done combing, empty the bowl of water down the drain. Flush the drain with some extra water to make sure you've gotten rid of all of the fleas. Bundle the sheet in a plastic bag and close it tightly. This will prevent any living fleas from escaping when you carry the bag to the washing machine."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Bathe your pet with warm water and dish soap.",
          "description":"Place your pet in the tub or sink where you usually bathe them and rinse them with warm water. Squeeze a couple of drops of dish soap into your palms and rub the soap into your pet's coat. Take care to avoid getting any soap in their eyes, as it could irritate them. Rinse the pet with more warm water, and then dry them off with a towel. Use soap that is mild, dye-free, and fragrance-free. Dish soap is generally safe to use on pets, but ask your vet if you have any concerns. For example, it may not be safe to bathe some types of rabbit."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use a steam cleaner if you have one.",
          "description":"Follow the directions on your steam cleaner and use it on the carpets and furniture in your home. This includes couches, curtains, and beds. The high temperature of the steam will kill the fleas and any eggs. It's also a helpful tool for cleaning hard to reach spots, like deep carpeting. Don\u2019t forget the pet beds! If you don\u2019t have a steam cleaner, see if you can borrow one from a friend. It\u2019s also pretty inexpensive to rent one from a hardware or home improvement store. If you can\u2019t borrow or rent a steam cleaner, that\u2019s okay. Just skip this step and go straight to vacuuming."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Vacuum your floors and furniture.",
          "description":"Run your vacuum cleaner in each room of your house. Make sure to reach all of your floors, area rugs, and soft furniture, like couches. Throw the bag away outside to make sure any surviving fleas don\u2019t escape into your home. If your vacuum doesn\u2019t have bags, take the cannister outside to empty it in the outside trash can."

Wash them in hot water with your normal detergent. Also wash any bedding that your pet uses, including their pet bed itself. You should also wash towels and any throw blankets that you use."

The soap will create a barrier on the surface of the water; the fleas will be able to get in, but won\u2019t be able to get out. Place the soapy water next to the lamp so that the bulb is near the bowl. The light will attract the fleas to the water. You can do this in any room where there might be fleas."

          "description":"You might have to spend a few bucks if you want to try this method, but it is still cheap and effective. Diatomaceous earth is a type of sand made from algae that have fossilized. It kills many pests, including fleas. Sprinkle a layer of food-grade diatomaceous earth on your floors, remembering to also hit area rugs. Let the powder sit for 1-2 days and then vacuum it up. This powder is safe for people and animals. You can purchase it online or in box stores. Make sure to empty the vacuum bag or container outside so that any living fleas don\u2019t escape back into your house."

The potassium in the peels will kill the fleas. Once the peels start to blacken, throw them away and replace them with fresh peels. If your pet tries to eat the peels, you can just use this method in rooms where your pet doesn\u2019t go. Banana peels are not toxic to pets, but you can check with your vet if you have any concerns."

Place the garlic in a large pot and pour in 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of nearly boiling water. Cover the pot and allow the mixture to steep for 12 hours. Pour the mixture through a strainer and place the water in a spray bottle. Spray the garlic water around your yard, making sure to spray the areas nearest your home. Don\u2019t soak the yard. A little garlic is fine, but too much could kill helpful insects. A little exposure to garlic won't hurt your pet, but if you have any concerns, you can keep them away from the area that you've sprayed."
