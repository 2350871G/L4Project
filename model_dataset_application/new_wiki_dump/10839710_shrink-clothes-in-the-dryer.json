Different varieties of cotton-based material require different shrinking approaches, and confirming what kind you have will inform which one you choose. If the label states that the garment is pre-shrunk cotton, don\u2019t bother trying to shrink it. It has already been shrunk, and it won\u2019t shrink again."

Simply putting them in the dryer is the safest way to shrink pure cotton. Contrary to popular belief, high temperatures are not the primary cause of cotton shrinkage. Instead, shrinking results from agitation, or the vigorous motion of the drying cycle. This means that you can dry a cotton garment on high or medium heat and end up with similar results."

To shrink your garment more dramatically, use a high-agitation setting and allow it to dry for the entirety of the short cycle. Repeat if the garment did not shrink enough."

Shrinking in blended fabrics often takes place gradually, not all at once. The higher the percentage of fibers besides cotton, the more times you will need to wash and dry your garment to get it to shrink. One exception to this rule is rayon \u2013 because it is made from natural fibers, it tends to shrink.
