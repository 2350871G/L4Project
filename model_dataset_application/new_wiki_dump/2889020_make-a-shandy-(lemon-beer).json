      "description":"As long as you have a lighter beer, you really can't go wrong. Here are some types of beer that you can use as the base for your shandy:\nWheat beer. Silky and smooth, but a little heavier, pairs wonderfully with the lemon. Lager. Crisp and refreshing, this makes a somewhat lighter shandy. Pilsner. A little more distinctive-tasting than your average lager, this beer creates a more complex shandy."

    {
      "headline":"Choose and pour your lemonade.",
      "description":"Whether you choose sparkling lemonade, regular lemonade, or lemon soda (such as Sprite or Squirt), your shandy is pretty much guaranteed to be good. A couple words of advice:\nIf you can, choose all-natural lemonade. With a great beer, natural lemonade tastes amazing. Sure, you can make a perfectly acceptable shandy with lemonade made from concentrate, but it won't have the same pizzaz as all-natural lemonade. If using a soda such as Sprite, add a little bit less than the specified amount (~150 ml). Lemon sodas are pretty sweet; a shandy made with lemon soda ends up being a little sweet for many people, overpowering the taste of the beer. You can always add more soda in at the end after tasting."
