      "headline":"Ask a Gryffindor student for the Fat Lady portrait password.",
      "description":"The Fat Lady's portrait is located at on the Seventh Floor of the Grand Staircase, and the password will take you to the Gryffindor Common Room. The Prefects of Gryffindor, Ron and Hermione are told on the train, but as you (Harry) and Ron confront the Fat Lady, you will discover that Ron has forgotten the password. Ron suggests that you ask another Gryffindor student. The Gryffindors are the students with red stripes on their uniforms. Just ask one of these students and they will tell you that the password is Mimbulus Mimbletonia, just like in the book."

    {
      "headline":"Talk to a Ravenclaw student to get the Basil Fronsac password.",
      "description":"This portrait is on the Second Floor and will take you to the Grand Staircase. Basil will instruct you to ask a Ravenclaw student where Rowena Ravenclaw came from. Ask any student and they will tell you that she was from the glens. Return to Basil's portrait to give him the information, and he will tell you that the password is Studious Success."

      "headline":"Get the Owl Wizard portrait password using the Daily Prophet.",
      "description":"This passage will take you from the Library to the Fourth Floor. When confronted, the Owl Wizard will ask you to look in the Great Hall for the Daily Prophet and retrieve the headline. In the Great Hall, perform the \"Accio\" charm on the owl reading stand at the front. You'll see a scene with four owls swooping down, in which one of them drops a Daily Prophet on the nearest table. Pick up the newspaper and Harry will read the headline out loud. Return to the Owl Wizard to read him the headline. He will say that the headline is boring and tell you that the password is No news is good news. The owls will only come down if the sky is turned off using Depluso and the candles are put out."

    {
      "headline":"Ask a Hufflepuff for the Giffard Abbott portrait password.",
      "description":"This portrait is on the first floor of the Grand Staircase, and the password will take you to the Transfiguration Courtyard. This is another useful passageway if you don't want to pass through the Viaduct to get to the other half of the castle. Since you helped Cedric Diggory last year, any Hufflepuff (the students with the yellow stripes on their uniforms) will be happy to inform you that the password is Dragon's Egg."

    {
      "headline":"Help get food for Damara Dodderidge to retrieve her password.",
      "description":"This password will take you to the Clock Tower. Damara, who is starving, will ask you to tell Giffard that she wants food sent up. Go talk to Giffard, and he will ask you to tell her that he will see what he can do. Deliver the good news to Damara, and she will tell you that the password is Chops and gravy."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Locate the Percival Pratt portrait password.",
      "description":"This password will take you from the Grand Staircase to the Boathouse. The portrait will tell you to \"Seek the man with faces three\" to find the password. Look on the Seventh Floor for a portrait of a black-robed man. He will say that he doesn't know the password, but to talk to Basil. Do so, and then Basil will send you to the shepherdess on the Second Floor. Just look around and you'll find her, she isn't difficult to miss because she often shouts out comments to passers-by. She will suggest you talk to Google Stump, who is the only portrait in the Viaduct Entrance. Finally, he will send you to Giffard, who, thankfully, tells you that The password is absurd. Go back to Percival, and he will gladly lead you to the boathouse."

      "headline":"Soothe the Nervous Gentleman to retrieve his password.",
      "description":"This password will take you from the Herbology Corridor to the Fifth floor. The Nervous Gentleman is across from the portrait of an eye. Anyone would feel awkward being watched by an enormous eye. All you have to do to soothe him is to cast \"Reparo\" on the two broken suits of armor on either side of the eye. The eye will be covered up by a Gryffindor banner and the Nervous Gentleman will thank you by telling you that his password is Flaming earwigs."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Ask Google Stump for his password.",
      "description":"This password will take you from the Viaduct Entrance to the First Floor. Google instructs you to rid the Viaduct Entrance of everyone around, so just hold your wand up at the students (or if you've learned \"Stupefy,\" you can cast that) to make them run away. Confront Google again and he will tell you that his password is Volo futurus unus, which is Latin for \"I want to be one.\""

    {
      "headline":"Get Boris the Bewildered's password from Myrtle.",
      "description":"This password will get you to the Second Floor from the Third Floor. Boris has not heard his password in fifty years, in fact, he's forgotten it. You have to rediscover it by asking anyone who was at Hogwarts fifty years ago to tell you the password. Since Myrtle has a crush on Harry, she will tell you that the password is Forget-me-never."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Use the Incendio spell to get The Man With Faces Three's password.",
      "description":"This password will take you from the Seventh Floor to the Fourth Floor. This man wants you to find \"himself\" in another portrait. What he means is to find the other door of his passageway, which is on the fourth floor, covered in cobwebs. Burn the cobwebs away with Incendio (if you have not learned the spell yet, you will have to wait until you do) and talk to him. He will say that his password is Three heads are better than one."

    {
      "headline":"Ask The Astronomer for his password.",
      "description":"This password will take you from the Dungeon Level of the Grand Staircase to the Seventh Floor. Hannah Abbott will not come to the Dumbledore's Army meeting unless you find a passageway to get her there safely. The passageway is simple: Just ask the Astronomer his password. He will tell you that his password is Scurrilous scoundrel."

    {
      "headline":"Get The Slytherin Witch's password by eavesdropping on Slytherins.",
      "description":"This password will get you to Dungeons from the Dungeon Corridor. This portrait of a rather nasty Slytherin Witch only lets through Slytherins who know the password. She suggests that you ask another Slytherin student, but since you know that Slytherins won't tell you something someone non-Slytherins shouldn't know, you'll have to eavesdrop. Put on your Invisibility Cloak and go to the Dungeon corridor (at the end of the grand staircase). Two Slytherins will be there, and you'll need to follow them to the portrait. They will tell the Slytherin Witch that the password is Slytherins are Supreme. Take off your Invisibility Cloak and return to the corridor to tell the Witch the password. You must have completed Ginny's quest to get the Doxy Venom from Umbridge's office to do this, therefore unlocking the privilege of the Invisibility Cloak."
