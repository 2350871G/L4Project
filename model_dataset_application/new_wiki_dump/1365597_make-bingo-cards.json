Each of the words/numbers/symbols should be separated by a comma. The bingo card generator will then randomly assort these items into separate boxes. For example: \"bat,bird,turtle,deer,hippo,dog,cat,bear,lion,.....etc.\" You can also do the same with numbers (3,5,17,24,56,78,....etc.) and/or symbols ($,&,*,%,@,....etc.).

The bingo card generator will first ask you whether or not you want a free space on your bingo card. Click on either \"Yes\" or \"No.\" The generator will then ask you to fill in the text of the free space. This could be something simple such as \"Free Space\" or something more complicated. You can choose from any number of letters, symbols, and/or numbers found on your keyboard. You will then have to decide where you want the free space to be located. There are generally two options, either \"Center\" or \"Random.\" Most of the time free spaces are placed in the center of a bingo card."

However, you can increase/decrease these numbers based on the amount of words you have, the type of bingo game you play, etc. You can even make bingo cards with elongated rectangles rather than the normal squares if you decide to do so. The generator will ask you to write in the number of squares you want your bingo card to have lengthwise. Click on the box and insert a number. The generator will ask you to write in the number of squares you want your bingo card to have height-wise. Click on the box and insert a number. Multiply these numbers together. You should have the same amount of words (assuming you don't have a free space) as the product of these numbers multiplied together. If you don't, you will have to either adjust the number of squares on your bingo card, or add/subtract words from your list."

Then click on \"Generate Bingo Cards.\" The generator will link with your printer. When your computer pulls up your print box, make sure to change the position of your sheets to \"Landscape Style.\" Since bingo cards get pretty beat up over the course of numerous games, it is best to print the cards out on card stock rather than traditional printer paper. You should also consider getting your cards laminated. Companies like FedEx and UPS offer pay-for laminating services. You may also have a local laminator near you."

Creating Bingo Cards by Hand Draw a large square. Do so on a piece of card stock paper. Use a ruler to help guide your lines. It is best to know ahead of time the number of columns/rows you will be using so that dividing them up later doesn't become to hard. For example, it is best to draw a top line of 10 inches if you wish to have 5 columns. That way you can easily divide them into columns (each column is 2 inches wide). If the top line were 9 inches, and you wish to have 5 columns, the math becomes much more difficult. In traditional bingo games, the top line and bottom line are the same length. However, this is only if you plan to have a traditionally square bingo card. Divide the large square. On both the top and bottom lines, make a small pencil mark where each column line will be. Connect the corresponding top and bottom marks with a straight pencil mark (use a ruler as a straight edge). On the left and right lines, make a small pencil mark where every row will be. Connect the corresponding left and right marks together using a pencil mark (use a ruler as a straight edge). Fill in your squares. You can put a term in each square such as \"dog,\" \"moose,\" etc. You can also put in numbers such as 56, 76, 87, etc. If you wish, you can also put in pictures of terms. Example: If you are making a bingo card for your Spanish classroom, you can put in Spanish words on the bingo card. Then call out English words, and the students will have to match the English word to the correct Spanish word on the bingo card. Feel free to decorate the card as well. Give the bingo cards a title. Draw designs surrounding the actual square itself. Be as creative as you want. Repeat the previous steps. Do so until you have enough bingo cards for the entire group of players. On each bingo card the words should be placed in different positions so that no two players have the same cards. If you are only using the square on each piece of card stock, you can cut the square out with a pair of scissors. If you have a design surrounding the bingo square on the rest of the card stock, do not cut out square.",
