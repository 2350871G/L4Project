  "text":" Peeling and Parboiling the Potatoes Peel the potatoes. Wash and scrub the 2 pounds (908 grams) of potatoes, then use a potato peeler to completely peel them. Dispose of the peelings and place the potatoes in a large pot. Cook the potatoes over medium high heat. Fill the pot of potatoes up with cold water until the water covers the potatoes by about one inch (2.54 cm). Then turn the heat to medium high. Bring to a boil and reduce the heat. Cook the potatoes over medium heat until they reach a boil, then reduce the heat to medium low. Cook about 6-7 minutes on medium low heat. Cook the potatoes for about 6-7 minutes, then poke one of the potatoes with a fork. If the fork can pierce the potato fairly easily but still meets resistance in the middle of the potato, the potatoes are done parboiling.

Partially cooking the potatoes ensures that they will be light and crispy when fried or baked instead of dense or mushy. Drain the potatoes. Once parboiled, pour the potatoes into a colander to let the water drain away. Pat the potatoes with a paper towel, then place them on the counter to cool. Forming the Tots Shred the potatoes. Once cooled, finely shred the potatoes. You can use the food processor, making sure to use the grating attachment, or use a box grater to grate the potatoes by hand.

Form the paste into cylindrical tots. Scoop the mixture out onto a clean cutting board or counter. Pick up small scoops of the mixture and use your hands to shape it into cylindrical tots that are a little shorter than the length of your thumb. Frying the Tots Heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Place a large stockpot on the stove over medium heat. Pour in the vegetable oil and wait a minute or so for it to heat. Place the tots in the skillet. Drop the tots individually into the skillet, placing them about 1 inch (2.54 cm) apart. If the skillet isn\u2019t large enough to fit all the tots, fry them in batches so that the skillet doesn\u2019t get overcrowded. Flip the tots over at about 2 minutes. After the tots have fried for about 2 minutes, use a spatula to flip the tots over to the other side so that they cook evenly. The tots should be getting golden and start to look crispy. Remove the tots from the skillet. After about 3-4 minutes, the tots should be golden brown and crispy.

Let the tots sit on the paper towels for about 30 seconds, then serve while hot. Garnish with parsley if you wish and serve alongside ketchup, mayo or your favorite dips. Baking the Tots in the Oven Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (218.33 C). Begin baking your tater tots by preheating the oven to 425 degrees F (218.33 C). If you want extra crispy tots, preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (232.22 C). Spread the tots on a baking tray. Cover the baking tray with parchment paper, then place the tots on top. Parchment paper will make cleanup easier than baking the tots directly on top of the baking tray. Toss the tots in olive oil. Drizzle 1 tablespoon (14.79 ml) on the tots, then toss them to lightly coat them in the oil. Then arrange the tots so that they are about one inch (2.54 cm) apart to ensure that they don\u2019t stick together. Bake the tots for 15 minutes and flip. Place the tots in the preheated oven and cook for about 15 minutes. Then use a spatula to flip the tots onto their other side and place them back in the oven. Bake the tots for 15 more minutes and serve. Keep the tots in the oven for another 15 minutes, then take them out and transfer them to a plate or serving platter. Garnish them with parsley if you wish, then serve them alongside your favorite dipping sauces.",
