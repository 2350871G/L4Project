This can disinfect these items and reduce the risk of contamination from other plants or pathogens. Look for pharmaceutical or food-grade peroxide. You may need to dilute the peroxide before using it. Use caution if you want to use a hydrogen peroxide solution over 10%. This can burn skin and plant tissue."

Add 2.5 teaspoons of hydrogen peroxide to each liter of hydroponic water. This can kill bacteria and fungi, prevent root rot, and stimulate oxygen circulation. In turn, your hydroponics may flourish."

It\u2019s also a natural weed-killer that doesn\u2019t use chemicals. Pour the peroxide on in the early morning or late evening to prevent the sun from quickly breaking down the solution. Avoid pouring over weeds that are in pots or plant beds. This may scorch both the weeds and your plants, killing both.
