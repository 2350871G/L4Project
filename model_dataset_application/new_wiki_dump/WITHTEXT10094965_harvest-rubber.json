          "description":"In theory, you can harvest rubber from a tree that is younger and/or smaller than these recommendations. However, the amount of latex you'll harvest is very unlikely to be worth your time and effort. Also, since younger trees can be more tender and have thinner bark, you're more likely to cut through into the cambium\u2014the very thin layer between the bark and wood that's responsible for the tree's growth. Doing so is bad for the tree's health."

          "description":"Face the tree, and plan a cut that will descend from your left to your right, no more than halfway around the tree. The cut should descend at a 30-degree downward angle from left to right, since the latex-containing lactiferous vessels descend at a slight angle from your right to left. Use a level, a protractor, and a piece of chalk to mark out your cut, if you want to ensure greater precision. The planned cut can be made at any height."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Make your cut 4.5 mm (0.18 in) into the bark.",
          "description":"Use an awl (a sharp, pointed tool) to cut along the line you made, just barely breaking through the surface of the bark. Other sharp-ended implements will work as well, but may offer you less depth control. If you cut more than 6 mm (0.24 in) deep, you'll pierce the cambium and damage the tree. You'll know you've pierced the cambium if the latex doesn't flow well and the area turns dark brown. If so, leave the tree alone to heal (for several months, at least) before tapping it again in another area."

          "headline":"Attach a 4 L (1.1 US gal) bucket to the tree.",
          "description":"The latex will flow down the channel you've just made, so you need to place a collection vessel at the bottom right end of the cut. Traditionally, metal collection buckets are tied securely to the tree with sturdy rope. The bucket will be fairly heavy when it's filled with latex. So, if you're concerned that you may not be able to tie it securely enough to the tree, consider supporting the bucket from beneath with scraps of wood, other buckets, concrete blocks, etc. Alternatively, you can plan out your cut so that your collection bucket will rest on the ground. But you should still tie it snug up against the tree bark."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Retrieve the bucket of latex 6 hours later.",
          "description":"Latex will flow for about 6 hours from a fresh cut until it coagulates, so check back after that amount of time to see how much you've collected. If you're lucky, the 4 L (1.1 US gal) bucket may be more than half full! For the best results, you should make your cuts early in the morning and collect your bucket around mid-day or early afternoon."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Repeat the process with a fresh cut each day.",
          "description":"You can, for instance, make a cut at the same height on the opposite side of the tree on the second day, then make a new cut on the original side (but either higher or lower on the trunk) on the third day. Over time, the original cut will heal over and you can create a new cut there. If the latex production reduces noticeably, give the tree several days of rest before tapping it again. Creating new cuts each time you collect won't produce the same quantity as an alternative method\u2014creating a single channel that you'll use to collect on a set schedule over a long period. However, the daily cut method is easier to do and can still produce ample latex."
