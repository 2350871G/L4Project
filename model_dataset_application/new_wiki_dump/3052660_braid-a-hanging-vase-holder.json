  "text":" Braiding the Upper Part Thread four pink cords to a wooden circle.  Upend a sky blue cord on the pink cords with the left end of cord short.  Bring the right side cord over the left one; wind the right cord around the pink cords for six times.  Braiding the Middle Part Tie up the sky blue cord to fix the pattern. Cut off any excess cord; glue the cut part to prevent unraveling. Divide the pink cords into two parts; each part must have four cords, so make the two parts respectively.  Make a loop with the right two cords; place the left two cords on the loop; thread the left two cords down to the right cords; bring the left two cords over to thread the hoop.  Tie up the knot.  Make the other part (using the remaining divided cords) in the same way.  Finishing the Braiding Braid the same knot with two parts at a distance of about 5cm/2 inches.  Make the twined knot in the same way as you made a twined beginning knot.  Cut off any excess sky blue cords and glue in place to prevent unraveling; leave the pink ones as they are, dangling down below the blue knot. You may wish to cut them evenly wherever they end naturally though, to neaten the final look. Add the container of choice. Before hanging high, always test it hanging at a low level first, to be sure it isn't strained.",
