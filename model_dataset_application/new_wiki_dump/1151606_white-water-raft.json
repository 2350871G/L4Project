          "description":"While you may initially want to sit on the inside of the raft, this will actually increase your chances of getting thrown overboard. Instead, sit on the outside rim of the raft and use the cross tubes or foot cones to plant your feet inside of the raft. If your raft has foot cones, place your foot closest to the inside of the raft under it. If your raft has cross tubes, sometimes referred to as a thwart, you can place one foot under them to help stabilize you. Your other foot should be wedged under the outside tube for stability. Sitting in the middle position will minimize your chances of getting thrown overboard. Do not push your feet too deeply into the cross tubes or foot comes, or they may become caught if your raft flips over. Those sitting in the front will get to see the most downriver but must also have skills to steer the raft for the rest of the group."

          "headline":"Use the correct hand position when holding your paddle.",
          "description":"An improper grip on the paddle while your raft goes downstream could be a safety hazard for others around you. One hand should be placed firmly on the shaft of the paddle while your other hand should be at the end, covering the \"T\" grip. The \"T\" grip can cause injuries to the face and body of other rowers if it flys out of your hand. Practice alternating with both hands to see what feels most comfortable for you."

          "headline":"Learn how to use the paddle.",
          "description":"Using only your arms will tire you out quickly. Instead of using your arms alone, lean into the stroke as you paddle and use your body weight to lean back. Synchronizing your paddling with others will give you more control over your raft. You should also lean into the stroke when you perform a backstroke. To perform a backstroke, lean forwards and pull your paddle backward as you use your leg to anchor you. Paddle hard while you go down the rapids to help stabilize you in the raft. Those in the raft should try to synchronize their paddles with the people in the front. The paddle in the water creates a resistance that makes another bracing point for you, which is the reason why increases your stability."

        {
          "headline":"Pull your paddle into the raft and brace yourself when going over a bump.",
          "description":"Often an instructor or experienced white water rafter will yell \"bump\" if your raft is about to go over a hard object such as a rock. In this case, you should pull your paddle out of the water and lean in towards the center of the raft. Place the \"T\" grip on your paddle on the ground and maintain your grip on it as you go over the rough spot."

More importantly, they will likely set the pace and yell out instructions as your raft goes down the rapids. Follow the instructions exactly as the raft instructor lays out and try to stay calm if it gets bumpy. The instructor will often point into the direction where they want the raft to go.

If you are new to white water rafting, experienced rafters will be able to help you and answer questions as you go. White water rafting in the dark is incredibly dangerous because you can't see where someone is if they get thrown overboard, and you also can't see potential obstructions like rocks in the distance."

This disrupts your breathing pattern and clouds your judgment which could make it harder to get back onto your raft. Stay calm and aim to reach the surface of the water. Once you do that, you can better assess how to move forward and get yourself out of harm's way.

Many times when you're thrown overboard, you'll end up right next to the raft.

The Whitewater swimming position is when your feet are pointed out in front of you over the water while you float down the river on your back. Your knees should be slightly bent so that you can absorb any shock from oncoming rocks or shallow areas of the river. When you are going downstream in this position, try to take breaths when the water is low, not on the crest of the wave. Do not try to stand in the water because your feet and ankles can become stuck in rocks and cause serious injury.
