  "text":" Prepare the Dough Place the butter in a mixing bowl with the confectioner\u2019s sugar.  Beat the ingredients at medium speed, using a handheld mixer or a stand mixer with a paddle attachment. The mixture should be pale yellow and smooth in texture when you are done. Add the egg and beat the mixture for an additional minute.  Add 1/2 cup of the flour and beat the mixture until the flour is just incorporated.  Repeat the process, adding flour in 1/2-cup increments until you have added all three cups.  Sprinkle the dough with kosher salt and beat the dough for 30 seconds.  Place the dough on a clean surface and divide the dough into 2 halves.  Place one half back into the mixing bowl.  Add the cocoa powder to the mixing bowl and beat the dough until the cocoa powder is thoroughly incorporated.  Roll the Dough into Logs Divide each flavor of dough in half.  Cover your work surface with parchment paper.  Roll 1 plain dough half onto the parchment paper into a rectangle measuring 10\" by 8\".  Cover your work surface with another piece of parchment paper.  Roll 1 chocolate dough half onto the second piece of parchment paper into a similar rectangular shape. Using the parchment paper will make it easy to lift the rolled-out dough from the surface when you are ready to stack it. Place the chocolate dough on top of the plain dough making sure the parchment paper is on the top.  Peel the parchment paper off the chocolate dough.  Trim the edges of the stacked dough with a chef\u2019s knife until the dough is even, with no overlapping. If you have a clean ruler, you can use it now as a guide. Starting with a shorter end, use clean hands to fold the edge of the dough up and over, transforming the edge into a tightly rolled circle. Continue rolling the dough inward until you have formed a log shape. Repeat the process with the remaining dough to make a second log.  Cover each log in plastic wrap and refrigerate the logs from 1 hour to 1 day.  Bake the Cookies Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.  Remove the plastic wrap from 1 dough log and place the log onto a cutting board.  Place the sharp edge of a chef\u2019s knife 1/4\" from the front edge of the dough.  Slice through the log until you form one circular pinwheel cookie that is 1/4\" thick.  Place the cookie on a baking sheet at least 1-1/2\" from the edges. The cookies need room to spread slightly as they bake. Continue adding cookies until you have 1 dozen cookies on each baking sheet. Make sure to leave about 1\u201d of space between the cookies. Cover the baking sheets in plastic wrap and refrigerate them for 15 minutes.  Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180\u00b0C) while the cookies are chilling in the refrigerator.  Remove the plastic wrap from one baking sheet and bake the cookies for 5 minutes.  Turn the pan 90 degrees and bake the cookies for an additional 4 to 6 minutes. Let the cookies set, but do not let the plain dough brown too much. You want to have the best possible color contrast for your pinwheel. Remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to cool for 2 minutes.  Remove the cookies from the parchment paper with a spatula.  Place the cookies on a wire rack to cool. Allow the baking sheet to cool and cover it with fresh parchment paper if you plan to bake additional batches of cookies. Repeat the baking steps with the second sheet of cookies. Continue cutting cookies, placing them on baking sheets, refrigerating them and then baking them until you have prepared as many cookies as you want.",
