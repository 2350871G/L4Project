          "description":"Tomatoes grow best at daytime temperatures of 70 to 80\u00ba F (21\u201327\u00ba C), and nighttime temperatures of 60\u201365\u00ba F (16\u201318\u00ba C). Make sure you can maintain these temperatures in your greenhouse for several months before you plant. Ideally, bring temperatures to the lower end of this range on overcast days, and raise them to the upper end (or even slightly higher) during clear, sunny days. You'll also need to keep humidity below 90% to prevent excessive leaf mold. Ventilate regularly to bring fresh, dry air into the greenhouse, especially on cool, cloudy mornings."

There are a few guidelines and tips that apply to all regions, however:\nTomatoes marketed as greenhouse varieties are more tolerant of greenhouse conditions. The letters VFNT and A after the name mean the variety is resistant to disease. \"Indeterminate\" tomatoes grow and produce fruit indefinitely, taking advantage of the longer growing season inside a greenhouse. If you're short on space, plant a \"determinate\" variety, which stops at a certain height."

You can use your preferred soil-less mix, or one of these options:\nPerlite bags or rock wool slabs are the cheapest options in many areas. Some growers prefer a 1:1 mix of sphagnum peat moss and vermiculite. Purchase sterile soil mix or make your own. Never use soil or compost from your garden without sterilizing. Choose this option if you do not want to install an irrigation system."

A 5:2:5 nutrient solution that contains calcium and magnesium is ideal. Dilute the solution according to label instructions."

Provide plenty of sunlight and keep the temperature at 75\u201380\u00ba F (24\u201327\u00ba C) during the day. To keep temperatures under control, you may want to start the tray in partial sun. Move to full sun once all seedlings have sprouted. This usually takes 5 to 12 days."

          "description":"Transplant the seedlings to small pots in the greenhouse about two weeks after they emerge. After six to eight weeks, or once seedlings are 4-6 inches (10\u201315 cm) tall, transplant them to larger pots or bags. A typical plant needs roughly \u00bd to 1 cubic foot of potting material (3.7\u20137.5 gallons, or 14\u201328 liters). Even smaller varieties may produce less fruit if grown in smaller pots. If you see any insects, mold, or disease spots on a plant, do not bring any of them to the greenhouse. Give each plant about 4 square feet (0.37 m) of floor space. Planting too close together can reduce airflow and encourage disease."

          "description":"Before the final transplant, you may want to check soil pH, which ideally falls between 5.8 and 6.8. If your soil is too acidic, add about 1 tsp (5 mL) hydrated lime for each gallon (3.8 L) of potting mix. Besides raising the pH, this adds calcium that can prevent blossom rot later on. If your pH is fine, mix in gypsum or calcium sulfate instead to add calcium without changing the pH. Alternatively, just choose a fertilizer that contains calcium and apply every week or two. In a hydroponics setup, you can supply calcium by injecting calcium nitrate into the irrigation feed. This requires a second injector, as calcium nitrate cannot be stored with your main fertilizer."
