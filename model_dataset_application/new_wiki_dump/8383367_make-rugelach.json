          "description":"Measure out 2 cups (240 g) of flour and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Place the dry ingredients into the bowl of a food processor. Cover the processor and pulse the dry ingredients to combine them. If you don't have a food processor, you can make the rugelach dough in a mixing bowl. Just whisk the dry ingredients together."

          "headline":"Add the cream cheese and butter.",
          "description":"Cut 8 ounces (226 g) of cold cream cheese and 1 cup (230 g) of cold unsalted butter into cubes. Add them to the dry ingredients in your food processor. Cover the processor with the lid and pulse the mixture 10 to 12 times. The cream cheese and butter should turn into large crumbles as they mix with the flour and salt. If you're using a mixing bowl instead of a food processor, let the butter and cream cheese soften. Use an electric mixer to combine them with the flour and salt."

          "headline":"Mix in an egg yolk and vanilla.",
          "description":"Place one egg yolk into a small bowl and beat it with 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Pour it into the butter and flour mixture in the food processor. Cover the processor with the lid and turn it on. Let the processor run until the rugelach dough starts to clump together. If you're using an electric mixer, just beat the egg yolk and vanilla into the butter and flour mixture until the dough starts pulling away from the sides of your mixing bowl."

          "headline":"Shape the dough into disks and chill them.",
          "description":"Dump the dough mixture onto a counter or work space. Use your hands to form the dough into one large ball. Take a sharp knife and carefully cut the dough into four equal parts. Shape each portion into a 1-inch (2.5 cm) disk and wrap each of them in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough for a minimum of 2 hours. You can chill the dough for up to three days or freeze them for up to three months. If you freeze the dough, thaw it in the fridge before you roll it out and fill the rugelach."

Add 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon of light brown sugar, and 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder. Stir the mixture to make the chocolate filling. To save time, you could substitute the bittersweet chocolate with miniature semi-sweet chocolate chips that you don't need to finely chop."

To make any flavor of fruit filling, just warm up 1/4 cup (80 g) of marmalade or jam until it turns liquid. Stir in 1 tablespoon of sugar and let the sweetened jam cool. Stir in 2 cups (10 ounces or 400 g) of finely chopped dried fruit (like apricots, cranberries, cherries or currants) until the fruit filling mixture is combined. Consider using a food processor to finely chop the dried fruit. This will ensure that the pieces of fruit are small and uniform."

Use a rolling pin to roll the disk out into a large circle. The circle should be about 1/8-inch (3 mm) thick. You can sprinkle more powdered sugar if the dough sticks. The circle of dough doesn't have to be completely neat. It's fine if there are cracks around the edges since you'll be rolling the dough into crescents."

If you want, you can use more than one type of filling for a circle of dough. Just place half of one type of filling on one side of the circle and use the other type for the rest of the circle.
