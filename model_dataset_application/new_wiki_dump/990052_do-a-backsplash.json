          "description":"Many people pick glazed ceramic tiles when making a backsplash, but there are a wide variety of options. You could hire a professional, but they often charge about $20 per square foot to install tile. These tiles usually cost on average about $5 to $10 per square foot, unless you choose designer tiles instead, which cost more. The cost for a do-it-yourself tile backsplash can run as little as $200. You will need to decide whether to use border tiles as well as what are called decorative field tiles. Some tiles come with adhesive backs and some don\u2019t. Slate tiles are less expensive. You can get these materials at home centers. Mosaic tile sheets are popular. You may want to seek professional help if you are using unique materials. The backsplash tiles can mirror your own artistic sensibilities. People make backsplashes out of marble tiles, metal, subway tiles, glass, pearl shell, and ceramic. Tile is the most popular with natural stone second. Some people use wallpaper as a backsplash."

          "description":"You will also need tile spacers, adhesive, grout, grout sealant, and tools such as a grout float and a trowel. Tile spacers are necessary for laying tile. Place the tile spacers in between the tiles at each corner point. People generally use one of two kinds of mortar when making a backsplash: thinset, and mastic. For glass tiles, it's best to use a white, latex-additive thinset mortar. Stone tiles usually require white thinset mortar. Use mastic for ceramic and some porcelain tiles. Thinset mortar can be used for most other tiles. Buy a notched trowel that matches the size of your tiles. You will usually want a trowel with 1/4- or 3/8-inch notches. You will apply the mortar by using the trowel's flat side to spread it onto the wall."

Use tape to protect the edges of the backsplash area, and shut off any power in the area before you remove cover plates that might be in the backsplash area. To turn off power to the kitchen, find the residential service panel, which is usually in the basement or garage. It might be in a closet or laundry area in an apartment or outside in warmer regions of the country. It's usually a gray box. Find the switch marked as kitchen, and switch it to the off position. Now, put a piece of cardboard or craft paper on the countertop to protect it from any damage during the course of the project."

          "description":"Figure out where the tile is going to go before you actually apply it to the kitchen wall. Sometimes, it works best to center your tile around a focal point like a faucet. Mark the start and the end point for the tile so you know how much you are going to need and where you plan to put it. Lay out the tile on the floor or on a large table to make sure the layout works, then measure it to be sure it fits the dimensions on the wall. Use tile spacers to account for grout. Put tile spacers in the corners of the tiles as you lay them to create even grout lines. Some smaller tiles have small protrusions called lugs that fit into the tiles next to them to create space for the grout. Grout is a mortar or paste used to fill the spaces between the tiles, giving it a finished look. Start with the spot on the wall that you can most easily see. Then, move outward and upward from that point. Use a level or straight edge to make sure the tile isn\u2019t crooked. You might need to cut tiles if they won\u2019t fit. A tile cutter will work for ceramic or porcelain tiles. Natural stone or thicker glass tiles may require a wet saw. Be very careful when using any cutting instruments.

EXPERT ADVICE\t\t\t\tSam Adams, owner of cherry Design + Build, responded: \"You should start where you want a central focal point, like behind the range or the kitchen sink. Start in the center and draw a level line up from the counter top to the cabinet or hood, whatever is above it. You can center one tile that's split 50% on each side of the line or place two tiles that butt into each other on the center line. As the backsplash works its way up and spreads to the outsides of the upper cabinets, you get an even reveal of the tiles on each side, and it looks intentional, purposeful, and symmetrical.\""

Start spreading the mortar or mastic on the wall where you will place the tiles. You will want to begin with a 2-foot section. Spread the mortar in a thin layer by using a trowel. Press it at a 45 degree angle. This method will make the mortar fully adhere to the wall. Now, use a notched edge of the trowel to add more mortar on it, and comb even ridges in one direction. Working in small sections helps prevent the mortar from drying as you apply the tile. Use the trowel to apply mastic in similar fashion. You will want to use the right trowel size. If you are using natural stone tile, you will want a notch trowel that is \u00bc by \u00bc inch in size. You may choose thinset/adhesive for glass tile instead or tile with adhesive on the backs."

You are going to have to cut extra tile pieces if there is space left between the top tile row and kitchen cabinets. You don\u2019t want the tiles to sit directly on the countertop. Leave a small gap that you will caulk later. Use plastic tile spacers to create even grout lines by placing them in the corners of the tiles..

You can use caulk or silicone sealant to fill any expansion gaps between the tiles and counter or cabinets. Use a grout float to fill the joints. Push the grout at a 45-degree angle with the grout float. Scrape away extra grout when the joints are filled. Hold the gloat a a nearly 90-degree angle to scrape it off. Shape and firm up the grout by dragging in instrument across every joint. Use the edge of the grout float, a toothbrush handle end, or even a finger. Use a damp sponge to wipe away excess grout. Fill a bucket with the amount of water recommended on the grout packaging. Add the grout powder and mix together. Use unsanded grout if the gaps are less than 1/8 of an inch. Let the mixture stand for 5-10 minutes and then mix again. Apply the grout with a grout float tool at a 45-degree angle, working diagonally and wiping off any excess grout. Work in sections.

This can take over a day and sometimes as much as three days. Apply grout sealant. After the grout has dried, put sealant on the lines and joints. Some sealant comes in a spray-on bottle, and other sealant is applied with a sponge or brush. Start at an end tile, and spread a uniform coating of sealant over all of the grout, including in the corners. Wipe away any excess sealant with a rag. Let the sealant dry for about an hour, and apply a second coat. Let that dry. Put your appliances and cookware back on the counter. Turn the power in the kitchen back on."
