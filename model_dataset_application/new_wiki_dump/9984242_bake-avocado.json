You can save the scooped avocado centers as a small condiment for other dishes. A useful way to store avocado is to coat it with olive oil or lemon juice and place it in an airtight container in the fridge. The remaining avocado makes a delicious spread for sandwiches."

The foil helps keep the avocado halves secure and prevents them from rolling around in the oven. The foil also helps keep the toppings intact."

Just make sure that the yolks stay inside the halves. As with most recipes that call for eggs, be careful not to let any shells into the avocado. You can prevent this by lightly tapping the egg on a bowl or edge of the kitchen counter. Only create a small crack and carefully separate the egg shell over the avocado half. If a piece of shell falls into the egg, simply use the shell to scoop it out."

Let cool. Bon appetit! This recipe can be served with warmed flour or corn tortillas. For best results, warm tortillas on a skillet, in the oven, or over a direct heat source, such as a gas range stove."
