Remove as much vomit from the carpet with paper towels and immediately dispose in a plastic trash bag. Consider holding your nose during this process if you sensitive to smell or you can spray concentrated room spray in the area to reduce the bad odor. Make sure you remove as many \u201cchunks\u201d as possible."

Go over area several times with the vacuum cleaner, emptying the canister between several passes. Wash vacuum filter and clean vacuum cleaner to remove any semblance of vomit."
