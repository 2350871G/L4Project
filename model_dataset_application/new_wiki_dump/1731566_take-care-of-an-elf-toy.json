      "headline":"Feed your elf.",
      "description":"He/she probably hungry after his/her journey all the way from the North Pole to your house! All elves have a sweet tooth, so two-three little candies, like M&M, Skittles, or Smarties, will do just fine. They only eat at night, though!"

      "headline":"Read to your elf.",
      "description":"(s)he probably bored after his journey, also. Christmas stories are an elf's favorite, but elves like any kind of book!"

      "headline":"Take your elf somewhere.",
      "description":"Whether you just walk down the street or go on vacation, your elf will love it! Some suggestions are Grandma's house, the park, your favorite place to play outside, your backyard, your friend's house, or the ice skating rank. They don't get to see any type of weather besides snow, and they have no clue what outside looks like if it's not at the North Pole. So, your elf will find it very interesting to go somewhere!"

    {
      "headline":"Be your elf's teacher.",
      "description":"He/she can't go to his/her regular school while he/she is away, so he/she won't learn anything. It's up to you to teach him/her! Teach him/her things you think elves would need to learn, like gift wrapping or cookie making."

      "headline":"Play with your elf.",
      "description":"Play dress up, play pretend, do a puzzle, play a board game, play video games, or anything you would like. Elves love it all!"

    {
      "headline":"Sit down and relax.",
      "description":"After all that playing, your elf is probably getting a bit tired. Sit down and give your elf some clay hot chocolate, and drink some people hot chocolate for yourself."

      "headline":"Get ready for bed.",
      "description":"If your elf and you would like, you could change him/her into pajamas. If his/her clothes don't come off, don't worry about it, or put some pajamas over his/her clothes. Give him/her an elf bath. Elves don't need water to get clean. Instead, put him/her in the bathtub you built (no water!) or a doll bathtub. Wipe him/her down with a dry cloth, and be sure to spritz him/her with just a dab of perfume once a week to keep him/her smelling nice."

      "headline":"Read him/her a bedtime story, then tuck him/her into his/her elf bed.",
      "description":"You could use an unfolded pillowcase, a dry hand towel, or a doll blanket for him/her. Be sure to give him/her a kiss and tell him/her if he/she goes to bed now, you'll play with him/her again tomorrow!"
