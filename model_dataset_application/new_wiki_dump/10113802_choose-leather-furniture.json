For a more traditional, rustic or timeless style, choose high-grade leather such as full alinine. Full Aniline is leather that is soaked in aniline dye. Its texture is soft and supple, and shows the natural grain, markings and colour variations of the original hide. Over time it shows markings and wear, which will develop into a rich, soft sheen known as a patina."
