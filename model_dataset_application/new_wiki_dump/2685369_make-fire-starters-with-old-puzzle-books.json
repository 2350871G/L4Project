  "text":" Preparing the Wax Put some wax into an empty can. If you have any candles you don't want, these are an ideal source of wax (like the stub of a candle). Melt the wax in the can. You could put it on the stove in a pan of hot water, or put it in a slow cooker. Do not just warm the can straight on the top of the stove since that presents a serious fire risk from over-heated wax. Turning the Puzzle Book into a Firestarter Get your puzzle book and rip out three used pages. If you don't have a puzzle book, other paper can work, provided it has newspaper-like texture. You don't want the paper that isn't really paper, for example, anything covered in soy ink. Fold the paper until it is the same as the approximate height of the can.  Start rolling the paper. You want it to be a fairly tight roll. Once it is rolled up tightly, wrap it with string, yarn or whatever other tying thread you're using. In this article, sewing thread is used. Note that thread is actually a bit difficult to work with. If you have some thicker string, you will find it much easier to tie. Once the wax is melted, put the rolled up paper in the can of hot wax. The single block of wax will not fill up the can, so you may want to go ahead and add a second one, once it has melted down somewhat. Use pliers or tongs to handle the paper rolls when putting them into the wax and taking them out. Let the paper soak up the wax. Leave the wax wherever it is that you melted it, and wait for the paper to absorb the wax. Once you determine that the paper rolls have soaked up enough (or you run out of wax), remove them from the can and lay them out to dry. You can put them on newspaper or wax paper, or whatever you have. Once dried, these can be packed into a resealable plastic bag for toting anywhere. They're great for camping, for taking backpacking or throwing in your fireplace.",
