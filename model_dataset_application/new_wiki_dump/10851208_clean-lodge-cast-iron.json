These layers provide protection against moisture and rust, and result in a natural, smooth surface that your food won\u2019t stick to. When applied to cast iron and baked, the fat molecules in the oil undergo a process of polymerization which results in a hard, plastic-like coating."

          "description":"Anytime you cook with and clean your cast iron, protect your hands from burns with heat-resistant handle covers, oven mitts, or potholders. Cast iron retains significant amounts of heat and cools down slowly, but you\u2019ll want to wash, dry, and season your cookware while it is still warm. Food residue releases more easily from the surface of warm warm cast iron and should be removed before it bakes and hardens on. When applied to warm cast iron, seasoning oils will react with the metal and polymerize. This will not occur on a cool or cold surface, so do not wait for your cookware to cool down. Unlike the separate heat-resistant handles attached to other types of cookware, a cast iron pan is made by pouring iron into a pan-shaped mold. Because the finished product is a single piece of conductive metal, heat will travel from the base upon the heat source through the sides and handles."
