These laws vary from country to country, and even state to state, so research online before you record without consent. In the United States, many states have laws against violating privacy when recording, like in bathrooms or personal bedrooms. There are different laws if your intent is based on distributing recordings, selling your videos, or using footage in court. Make sure to research this accordingly."
