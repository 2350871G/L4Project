          "description":"If your doctor advises against taking CBD oil for panic attacks, they may offer you other medication options instead. The most commonly prescribed medications for panic attacks are antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and sedatives, such as benzodiazepines. Antidepressants can help to reduce the number and severity of panic attacks, while sedatives are quick-acting drugs that can help to calm you down when you are having a panic attack. Keep in mind that it may take several weeks for antidepressant medications to take effect. However, it\u2019s important to keep taking them regularly. Warning: Benzodiazepines are easy to become addicted to and withdrawal symptoms may be severe if you stop taking them suddenly after regular use, so it\u2019s important to use caution while taking them."
