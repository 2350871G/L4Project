          "headline":"Boil your veggies and meats to cook them without using any oils or fats.",
          "description":"All you need to boil food is a large pot, water, and a little bit of salt. Carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, potatoes, chicken, and beef are just a few options for ingredients you can boil. Check online for specific boiling times. Vegetables like carrots and broccoli generally take about 8-10 minutes to boil, whereas potatoes will take a little bit longer, about 15 minutes. Use a meat thermometer to check the interior temperature of meats to make sure they\u2019re cooked all the way through. Once you think the meat should be done, remove it from the hot water with tongs and place it on a cutting board. Insert the meat thermometer and check the temperature: chicken should be cooked to 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C) and beef should be cooked to 160 \u00b0F (71 \u00b0C). If it isn\u2019t cooked yet, add it back to the hot water for another couple of minutes. Boiling is a simpler way to cook, and it\u2019s healthier than using lots of fats\u2014but it does also compromise the nutrients of the foods. Some veggies, like brussels sprouts, broccoli, and sweet potatoes, are water-soluble, which means they lose some nutrients when cooked in water."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Steam your veggies and fish to keep all their nutrients intact.",
          "description":"You can place a steaming basket over a pot of boiling water or you could also wrap your ingredients in foil and place them in the steamer basket to contain all the juices. Simply bring a pot of water to a boil, place your steam basket on top, and add your ingredients to the basket. The best ingredients to steam are veggies like green beans, zucchini, and asparagus. Fish fillets and shellfish also steam well. In general, the veggies and meats that take the least amount of time to cook are the best ones to steam. Veggies generally take about 15-20 minutes to steam, whereas fish will take only about 6-15 minutes, depending on how thick the fillet is. Check online for specific steaming times. Add a pinch of salt or some lemon juice to your steamed veggies or fish for some extra flavor."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Grill your meats and veggies for a nice smoky flavor and less fat.",
          "description":"Grilling is great because it makes your meat tender while also letting the fat drip away from it, which is healthier for you! It also imparts a nice flavor to meats and veggies. You can grill steak and chicken, as well as vegetables, like asparagus, peppers, onions, zucchini, and even lettuce! There are some studies that suggest the char from grilled foods is carcinogenic and shouldn\u2019t be eaten regularly. To combat this, try to grill leaner cuts of meat that have shorter cooking times or use a gas or electric grill if you can. You can even grill fruits, like peaches, for a tasty addition to main meals and desserts."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Stir-fry your food for a quick, flavorful option.",
          "description":"Use a few teaspoons of a healthy cooking oil, like extra virgin olive oil or avocado oil, and add in your chopped veggies and protein for a 10-minute meal. Because the cooking time is so short, there is less time for your ingredients to lose their healthy nutrients. Try stir-frying mushrooms, zucchini, peppers, onions, and chicken for a tasty dinner option. Add a little bit of low-sodium soy sauce and some garlic to the dish for some extra flavor. Your body does need some fats in order to function at its best, so its okay to use heart-healthy oils. Avoid using butter, lard, and sauces that are high in calories, fat, and sugar."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Broil your meals in the oven for a fast way to cook.",
          "description":"Broiling is a high-heat option that doesn\u2019t require you to add any additional oils or fats to your dish. Use lean cuts of meat, like chicken and fish, and heartier vegetables like squash and onion. Make sure you preheat the broiler before putting your dish in the oven or broiler drawer. Meals take about 12-15 minutes to broil. Always check your meat with a meat thermometer before serving it. The risk with broiling foods is that because of the high heat level, the food can dry out quickly. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a good idea to use thinner, leaner cuts of meat so that they won\u2019t take as long to cook."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Microwave your food so it retains its nutrients while cooking quickly.",
          "description":"A microwave with a carousel that rotates the food is the best kind to use. Make sure you put your food into microwave-safe dishes. Use a flat plate to cover the dishes when you microwave them to keep the food moist. Check online for cooking times for different ingredients. There are some myths out there about microwaving, but you don\u2019t need to worry about losing nutrients through microwaving veggies or about unhealthy radiation. Microwaves use electromagnetic radiation, which is different from that kind of radiation that causes cancer. Potatoes take about 15 minutes to cook in the microwave, whereas broccoli takes about 6 minutes. If you cook meat in the microwave, make sure to check the internal temperature before you eat it. Microwaving is a fast, healthy option. It essentially steams the food, so keep in mind that you won\u2019t get any of the flavor that you might from grilling or stir-frying. Try adding some seasonings to your food, like salt, pepper, or lemon juice."

          "headline":"Try eating raw foods to avoid losing any nutrients through cooking.",
          "description":"Focus on eating uncooked and unprocessed foods, like fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and pasteurized dairy products. Eating only raw foods isn\u2019t recommended for children or for women who are pregnant or who plan on becoming pregnant. Check with your doctor if you have concerns about your daily food intake!"

These options contain more fiber and they take longer to digest, so they keep you full for longer. Check out other healthy grain substitutes like quinoa, couscous, and barley. These options generally have more fiber, fewer calories, and are denser grains which means you\u2019ll be fuller for longer.
