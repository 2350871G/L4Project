  "text":" Preparing the Dough Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) and spray a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray.  Combine the flour, sugar and baking powder in a large bowl, using a whisk. If you\u2019re using a stand mixer, then use the mixing bowl that goes with your stand mixer. Add the shortening (or butter or margarine) and beat the mixture with a handheld mixer, a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, at low speed or with mix with your hands. Continue beating until the shortening is incorporated into the mixture. Add the milk, egg and lemon zest to the flour mixture, beating the mixture on low (or mixing with your hands) until all the ingredients are combined.  Baking the Cookies Roll the dough into balls, that have a diameter of 1\" (2.5 cm), using your hands.  Place the balls of dough about 1\" (2.5 cm) apart on the baking sheet.  Bake the cookies for 5 to 6 minutes and then turn the pan 180-degrees to ensure even browning.  Bake the cookies for an extra 5 to 6 minutes.  Remove the cookies from the oven when they are golden brown and allow them to cool on the stove top for 2 minutes.  Loosen the cookies with a spatula and place them on wire racks to cool before icing them.  Adding the Icing Beat the confectioner\u2019s sugar, shortening and lemon zest in a mixing bowl, using a handheld mixer or a stand mixer with a paddle attachment at low speed.  Add the warm milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the icing reaches the consistency that you like.  Spread the frosting on top of the cooled cookies using a cheese spreader or a butter knife.
