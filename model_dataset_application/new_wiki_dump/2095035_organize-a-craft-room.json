          "headline":"Gather all of your craft items.",
          "description":"Grab a basket and walk throughout your living space grabbing any and all craft supplies and tools. Carry them into your designated craft room and place everything in the middle of the floor. Once you think that you\u2019ve gotten it all, go back through one more time just to be certain. Make sure to open all of your drawers and cabinets, as craft supplies can often \u2018hide.\u2019\nLikewise, go through your craft room and identify any objects or items that do not belong there and move them out. They may need to go in a \u2018staging area\u2019 in another room, so that you can concentrate your energy on your craft area."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Sort your supplies out according to item type.",
          "description":"Look over your supply pile and begin to build smaller piles based upon different categories of supplies. For example, put all of your wrapping paper together. All fabrics should go together initially. After these first piles are finished, you can go back through them and narrow them even further according to size and color. For example, put all of the red wrapping paper together. At this point your room may be in controlled chaos, so be careful walking around or you may slip on one of your piles. For that reason, try to keep other people out of the room as well, at least during this stage. To keep you from feeling overwhelmed, bring an egg timer into the room and set it for 15-minutes. When the timer goes off, take a 5-minute break. Then, re-set the timer and start again. This will keep you motivated to work at a steady pace without burning out."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Decide what to donate.",
          "description":"As you sort, identify items that are worth donating. Perhaps you have multiples of some items or maybe leftover supplies from projects that you\u2019ve completed and moved on from. Make sure that whatever you donate is safe for another user. For example, don\u2019t donate rusty scissors or any cracked glass items. Various charity organizations, schools, and libraries will gladly accept donations of craft supplies as long as they are in good condition. This is a great opportunity to share your interest in crafting with other people. Depending on the amount of items that you have, some charities will actually come to your house and pick them up for you. This may be a good opportunity to do organize other areas of your home as well."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Create a trash pile and dispose of it.",
          "description":"As you sort, identify items that need to be thrown away. This could be items that you no longer find useful, but that aren\u2019t suitable for donation due to condition or quantity. You should also trash any supplies that are no good anymore, such as dried out glue or frayed ribbons. Ask yourself if you\u2019ve used the item in the past year and if you haven\u2019t odds are it needs to be thrown away or donated. Take the trash out after you\u2019ve finished sorting the main pile. If you wait you are likely to leave it there and it will become an eyesore and will slow your organizing progress."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Repeat this process every few weeks.",
          "description":"As life goes on, many of your supplies will likely wander out of your craft space once more. To keep your area tidy and useful for you, go through a sorting and cleaning process fairly often, especially after completing a major project. Also, devote at least ten minutes after you finish working in your craft room for picking up and storing items in their new proper places. Devoting even this small amount of time can make a major difference in the long-term appearance of your craft room."

Extra-small items will need to be placed in extra-small containers and will probably be grouped together for storage and then usage. Keep an eye out for items that may appear similar but that have slightly different functions. These situations may require that you divide up your storage system even further. For example, you\u2019ll want to divide your fabric scissors from your paper scissors."

          "headline":"Use plastic bins.",
          "description":"These are the number one storage option when organizing a craft room. They come in a wide variety of sizes and are easy to stack. They also fit well within a cube shelf. You can see inside the clear bins, making it easy to find an item that you are looking for. Depending on how you arrange your bins, you will want to purchase ones that open on the top or via a front panel. Look for lids that snap on tightly to avoid spilling your supplies. Bins are also especially useful when working with messy items such as paints. In addition, they contain fumes from paints as well. Make sure to purchase extra bins, and to leave space in the ones that you currently use, for new supplies that you may purchase.

Claire Donovan-Blackwood of Heart Handmade UK says: \"If you're looking for a DIY budget solution for craft storage, try wrapping fruit tins with pretty patterned paper. You can use them to store paintbrushes, markers, and other things you use often. For small embellishments, try using a ceramic egg dish or a muffin tray. If you're using a muffin tray, you can even paint it to make it prettier.\""

It will also lead to beautiful displays of items within the room itself. For example, if you have a bunch of balls of yarn, sort them according to color (reds next to orange tints, etc.) and place them in a wooden cube bookcase for quick access and visual appeal."

          "description":"Almost any container that is sturdy with a lid can be reused as storage in your craft room. Try to think creatively and find jars, buckets, etc. that you find visually appealing already. They will be even more attractive when holding your supplies. Here are a few unique ideas. To house smaller items such as sequins, use little plastic pill storage boxes that you can get at a pharmacy or grocery store. For colored beads, place them in a spice rack by color for ease of access and beauty. Small tins or colored buckets make a great storage option for pens, pencils, and paintbrushes. For a more industrial look, grab a magnetic knife holder from your kitchen, attach it to the wall of your craft room, and use it to display your sharp cutting devices and scissors. This works best when positioned close to your standing work area. Look at crafting sites and blogs online or buy inspirational craft books/magazines in order to find additional design ideas that may suit your particular space and taste."

For example, the bin with tape should say, \u201cTape-clear.\u201d\nYou can get as fancy as you\u2019d like with the labels.
