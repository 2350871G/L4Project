      "description":"This requires practice. Put your hand on your stomach and breathe out, feeling your abdominal muscles contract. When you breathe in, they should expand. It should feel like sipping through a straw. Imagine drawing air from the bottom of your lungs, not the top. Do this a few times until it feels comfortable and you can do it without pressing a hand to your stomach. A practice scream should feel like something (namely your stomach muscles) is pushing it out of you by contracting around your lungs. It should not hurt."

      "headline":"Scream in a higher pitch.",
      "description":"Higher notes are generally more audible. They cause longer soundwaves, which hit people's ears that much harder. Even if you're male, let loose like a little girl. (Don't try too hard, mind you. Forcing your voice into a high note that is incongruous with your usual tone or higher than natural for your voice can cause minor injury.) Also, screaming higher and, if it so happens, shrilly, usually indicates fear more than a macho war cry. You're trying to say \"Help me!\" not \"I'm bad news!\""

      "description":"You may assume that a higher note means \"I should hold my chin higher\", but tilting your head backward can actually put excess strain on your vocal chords and make it harder to produce sound. So don't do it. Optimum volume is achieved when you hit the perfect note, frequency, and force of exhalation. This is the level at which glass shatters and dogs howl. If you can't get this amplitude, don't sweat it. Usually only professionals can. If you get anywhere close, count it as a success. In the best case scenario, you'll be loud enough to temporarily deafen your assailant. Don't count on it."
