Typically, they either plug directly into the wall or they have a cord that goes into the wall. Only plug it in if you're ready to warm your wax. Some have bowls that sit on top of a candle warmer, which is essentially a hot plate, while others just use a small, hot light bulb to warm up the wax. Others may heat the wax with a small tealight in the bottom, so you won't need to plug it in."

          "description":"Usually, there's a small bowl in the top of the warmer for the wax. Just use one piece of wax, as you don't want to overflow the bowl when it melts. Wax melts usually come in pre-portioned sizes. Different wax warmers will hold different amounts. For instance, a tart wax warmer is meant to hold a much larger piece of wax. If you want, you can set a silicone baking cup in the warmer first. That way, you can just pop the wax out of the baking cup when it solidifies. This also allows you to switch between scents easily."

After you turn it on, you may need to set the bowl that holds the wax back on top, depending on the style. You may even run into more unusual styles, such as a touch lamp. Touch the base of the lamp to turn it on, and the light bulb will heat up the wax. If yours has a tealight, place it in the holder and light it before setting the warming bowl on top."

Be careful handling the bowl or warmer. It could be very hot, and the wax definitely will be hot. Don't spill it on yourself.

After 5-10 minutes, take it out, and the wax should come right out of the bowl with a gentle push. If your warmer doesn't have a separate bowl, you can place the whole thing in the freezer, particularly with tea light versions. If the wax still has scent, you can save it for later.
