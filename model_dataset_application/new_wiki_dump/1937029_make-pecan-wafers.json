  "text":" Preparing and Chilling the Dough Place the butter, 1/2 cup of the granulated sugar and the brown sugar into a mixing bowl.  Using either a handheld mixer or a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugars together for about 2 minutes or until the mixture is creamy.  Add the egg and the vanilla and beat for an additional minute.  Combine the flour, baking powder and kosher salt in another mixing bowl using a whisk.  Add 1/2 cup of the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, beating the mixture until it is just combined.  Add the rest of the dry ingredients in 1/2-cup increments until all of the dry ingredients are incorporated into the wet ingredients.  Fold in the pecans using either a flat plastic spatula or a wooden spoon.  Lightly flour your clean hands. Scoop up the dough and divide it in half. Shape each half into a 6\" (15 centimeter) log.  Wrap the logs in waxed paper and place them in the freezer for about 1 hour or until they get firm.  Slicing and Baking the Cookies Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Cover 2 baking sheets in parchment paper. Remove 1 log from the freezer and unwrap it. Allow the log to stand at room temperature for 5 minutes. Combine the remaining 1/4 cup of granulated sugar and the cinnamon in a shallow bowl, stirring the ingredients with a fork.  Spread the sugar and cinnamon mixture on a large plate.  Roll the log in the mixture and then transfer the log to the cutting board.  Slice the log into 1/4\" (6 millimeter) circles using a chef's knife. Place 12 cookies on each baking sheet, making sure to leave about 1-1/2\" (4 centimeters) of space around each cookie. Bake 1 sheet of cookies for 10 to 12 minutes. Halfway through the cooking time, rotate the cookie sheet 90 degrees to ensure even browning. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and place it on top of the stove. Allow the cookies to cool on the stovetop for 2 minutes. Place the second baking sheet in the oven. Cook the second batch of cookies for 10 to 12 minutes, rotating once about halfway through the baking time. While the second batch of cookies is baking, loosen the first batch of cookies from the parchment paper and place the cookies on a wire rack to cool. Continue the cooling process with the second batch of cookies. When the 2 baking sheets have cooled, cover them with fresh parchment paper.  Remove the second log from the freezer, unwrap it and allow it to sit for 5 minutes at room temperature.  Roll it in cinnamon and sugar, slice it and bake it just as you did the first log. ",
