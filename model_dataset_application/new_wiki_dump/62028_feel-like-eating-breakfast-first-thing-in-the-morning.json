Aim to have your dinner finished 2 or 3 hours before bedtime, and avoid snacking after dinner to help build your appetite for breakfast. If you feel yourself getting hungry before bedtime, try drinking a glass of water first, or only snacking on something small. Opt for a few apple slices, some cheese cubes, or a banana rather than something more substantial. Some studies have found that eating less at nighttime and more during the day can help with weight loss and general health."

Make sure that you are getting at least 7 hours of sleep each night, and that you leave yourself time to eat breakfast the next morning. Try going to bed a little earlier than you usually would, so that you can wake up a little earlier as well."

If you want to start eating breakfast first thing, set your alarm around 20 minutes earlier than you usually would to make sure you'll have plenty of time to eat. Put your alarm out of arm's reach, so you have to wake up and get out of bed to turn it off or hit the snooze button."

Try going for a run, or even just doing some push-ups or sit-ups first thing in the morning before you sit down for breakfast.

Try planning ahead when shopping so you can vary your breakfast options based on what you're in the mood for. Here are a few simple suggestions:\nTry and get multiple types of cereal, or different toppings for your cereal or muesli for some easy variation. Stock up on eggs and choose one of the many ways to prepare them. Get something more interesting than white bread to replace your morning carbohydrates. Try scones, crumpets, bagels, French toast waffles or homemade biscuits. Purchase some frozen breakfast foods, such as some pastries or breakfast pizzas, for something special you can cook up quickly."

          "description":"Eating a big meal first thing in the morning might take some time to adjust to, either in terms of appetite or time. Instead, try making a fruit smoothie, or even drinking a glass of juice first thing in the morning. This will help get you in the habit of eating early, and may even kickstart your appetite and make you want to eat something else. Use whatever fruits and liquids you want when making your smoothie. Part of the fun is customizing it to whatever you're in the mood for! Keep some frozen fruit or berries in the fridge that you can throw into a smoothie without having to cut up or prepare. This will speed up the smoothie-making process, and the cold may help wake you up!"

Make some breakfast muffins or prepare some overnight oats to reduce the amount of work you have to do in the morning. There are plenty of different healthy breakfasts that you can prepare in advance. See what else you can find or come up with."

This will stop from you skipping breakfast on even the most stressful mornings, and make it an easy habit to keep. Trail mix and fresh or dried fruit are also great options for a quick breakfast."

If you're not in the mood for a bowl of oatmeal, dig into some leftovers from the previous night, or anything else that's in your fridge. As long as your breakfast has some protein and ideally some carbohydrates, it should set you up for the day or at least get you to lunchtime."
