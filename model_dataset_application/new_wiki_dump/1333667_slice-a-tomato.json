If you\u2019re working with small cherry or grape tomatoes, this step is unnecessary and you can skip ahead to the next step. Place your thumb right below the edge of a knife, preferable a small paring knife. Use your non-cutting hand to grab the base of the tomato, and stabilize your hand against the cutting board. Place your knife\u2019s tip slightly to the side of the core. Push your knife into the tomato about 1/4\u201d-1/2\u201d deep. Cut out a small circle by twisting your knife. Pull up to remove the core."

Place your non-cutting hand on the left side of the tomato (if you are cutting with your right hand). Curl up your fingers into a claw shape and press your fingers tips lightly on the tomato. This type of grip helps to stabilize the tomato and prevent you from cutting yourself. Place the tip of the knife on the cutting board behind the right most side of the tomato. Keeping the knife tip on the cutting board, drag your knife straight down and through the tomato. A sharp knife will make cutting easier. Once you are through to the other side, lift up the knife. Reposition your knife at the top of the tomato, about 1/4-1/2\u201d to the left of your last cut, depending on how thick you want your slices.
