          "description":"Boronia can stand up to full sunlight, but does best with partial or dappled light. Try to set aside an area that receives no more than a few hours of direct exposure a day. The wall along the eastern side of your home or the edges of a bed shaded by larger plants can often make an ideal position. Keep your boronia out of wide open areas and window hot spots where there\u2019s no shelter from the sun. It\u2019s especially important to protect boronia from the intense afternoon sunlight in midsummer, when high temperatures can scorch and dehydrate the leaves."

          "headline":"Test your planting soil.",
          "description":"Pick up a soil testing kit from your local gardening supply store to find the acidity of your chosen growing site. Boronia prefers soil that's slightly acidic, with a pH balance somewhere between 5.5 to 6.5. Anything outside of this range will make it difficult for your boronia to survive. You can lower the pH of your soil by mixing in a small amount of ground limestone, or bring it up by adding soil sulfur. If your soil's pH is not suitable, you can also grow the plant in a pot using the appropriate soil. Choose a large pot with drainage at the bottom, as well as a well-draining soil."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Make sure your growing site is level and well-drained.",
          "description":"Boronia is highly susceptible to root rot, which means flooding, pooling, or overly wet soil could become a serious problem. The simplest way to avoid moisture-related complications is to adding 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) of pea gravel to the bottom of the hole you dig while planting. The dense gravel will help filter out water that would otherwise saturate the roots of the shrub. Other materials, like compost or potting soil mix, can also work well in areas that are only slightly water retentive. Be sure to choose a location that isn't in danger of collecting runoff after a heavy rainfall."

          "headline":"Enrich dry soil with organic matter if necessary.",
          "description":"If you're working with a clay or sandy soil type, a good amendment material can help make it more hospitable by infusing vital moisture and nutrients. Add a handful of peat moss, leaf mould, or kitchen compost to the loose soil, making sure it\u2019s mixed in thoroughly. Once your plant blooms, you can fertilize it with a slow release granular fertilizer. Don't fertilize the plant right after planting, as this can burn damaged roots."

          "headline":"Keep your boronia sheltered from the wind.",
          "description":"Boronia is easily damaged by strong winds, especially in warm, arid conditions. For this reason, it's a good idea to prepare your growing site away from open areas and narrow, gusty channels like alleyways that might intensify a light breeze. This will be doubly important if the place where you live is flat or has few surrounding trees. By following the same general guidelines you did for determining sun exposure, you can ensure that it gets just the right amount of airflow without being unprotected. Fences, rocks, trees, and large perennials can also protect boronias by acting as a windbreak."

Of these, boronia megastigma (brown boronia) and boronia heterophylla (pink boronia) are by far the most popular and easiest to cultivate in a home garden. Other types include B. ledifolia, B. umbellata, and B. repanda, all of which feature colorful flowers and intriguing leaf patterns. Any of these species may be a good fit for your garden, provided it offers the right growing conditions. Consult a gardening expert to find out which species of boronia has the highest chance of success in your region."

You can continue growing your plant in its original container, or transfer it to the soil later if you\u2019d rather incorporate it into a larger flowerbed."

That way, the young plant won't be subjected to any drastic extremes in temperature. Wait until the weather warms consistently before attempting to transplant your potted specimen to outdoor soil. When properly cared for, some hardier species like B. crenulata and Tyalge Ruby can continue to put out new buds well into the following winter."

The dense pebbles will help keep the underlying roots cool and prevent precious moisture from evaporating under the heat of the midday sun. As an alternative to gravel, you can also use hardwood chips, plastic or rubber mulch, or large, flat stones, which can lend a pleasant aesthetic in ornamental gardens. A layer of hard mulch has also been shown to block the movement of fungal pathogens responsible for harmful diseases."

Generally, it\u2019s best to keep an eye on the soil around the root zone and give it a good drink once it starts to dry out. Most young plants should take in about \u20442 gallon (1.9 l) of water per day, while more developed specimens may need as much as 2.5 gallons (9.5 l). Take care not to overwater your boronia.

You can also use a couple handful of native plant food. These substances will supply the boronia with the nutrients it needs to produce healthy, vibrant, long-lasting foliage. Untreated horse or cow manure is also a good choice for feeding growing shrubs. Boronia is well-adapted to soils that are lacking in nutrients, so it doesn\u2019t require regular feeding."

Expect to trim back up to a third of the plant\u2019s overall size each time you prune. Resist the urge to remove late-blooming buds.

The most important thing is to treat your plants before pests and disease become an issue\u2014otherwise, it may be too late to save them. A few of the pests that tend to target boronia include grasshoppers, black beetles, nematodes, stem borers, and psyllids.
