Whether you got it from the supermarket, the farmer\u2019s market, or from a friendly neighbor, the FDA recommends washing all produce before cooking or eating it. Once it\u2019s cleaned to your satisfaction, you\u2019ll need to cut it. To cut your spaghetti squash, you\u2019ll want to use a very sharp knife.
