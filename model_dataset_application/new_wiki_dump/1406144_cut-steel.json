          "description":"Compound snips are sometimes referred to as \u201caviation snips\u201d or \u201ctin snips.\u201d These scissor-like tools allow you to cut through thin steel \u2013 24 gauge or thinner \u2013 in the same way you would cut through paper with ordinary scissors. Snips are a good choice if you need to make quick, short cuts on very thin steel. There are three kinds of compound snips, with color-coded handles to make them easy to tell apart. Straight snips have yellow handles and allow you to cut straight lines. Left-cut snips have red handles and allow you to cut counter clockwise curves. Right-cut snips have green handles and allow you to cut clockwise curves."

          "description":"Compound snips work great for short cuts, but longer cuts are best handled by a nibbler. Nibblers are hand-held tools. They are relatively inexpensive and make clean, high-speed cuts with minimal distortion and very little noise. They also create no sparks when cutting. Thicknesses vary from brand to brand, but in general a nibbler can cut up to 14 gauge steel. There are hand-operated, drill-powered, electric and pneumatic versions on the market. Every time the nibbler makes a cut, it punches out a small piece of sheet metal. By the time you\u2019re finished, you\u2019ll have many tiny crescent-shaped steel pieces littered all over the floor. Definitely clean those up as soon as possible \u2013 otherwise, the sharp little edges can get embedded in the soles of shoes and cause injuries."

          "description":"An angle grinder is an affordable handheld power tool that can handle many different grinding and cutting tasks. It can be fitted with an assortment of different blades, which makes it very versatile. The blade you need to use in order to cut through steel is called a metal cutoff blade. You can make fast cuts with the cutoff blade, but the downside is they will be fairly rough. It\u2019s difficult to get perfect accuracy with this tool. Wear face protection, ear protection (it\u2019s very loud) and thick work gloves when operating this tool. Sparks will fly when the blade touches the metal, so make sure there\u2019s nothing flammable nearby. Make sure you read the instruction manual carefully and are using the correct blade for cutting steel."

The cuts may also be a bit rough, you won\u2019t be able to maneuver the saw much and its blade can\u2019t cut very deep. However, a hacksaw is great tool to have on hand to take care of simple steel-cutting tasks. Keep its blade in good condition by rubbing wax on it after each use. To get a cleaner cut, try using a strip of masking tape on the bottom and top of the sheet metal. This will prevent scratching."

Throatless sheers can cut inside curves and other complicated shapes, in addition to outside curves and straight lines. They look and operate much like office paper cutters. A lever fitted with a blade is pulled down over the place you want to cut. To operate, mark the cut line on the piece of sheet metal. Situate the metal under the blade and line the blade up with the cut line. Pull the handle down slowly with your hand and slice through the metal."

A chop saw can handle a lot of different steel-cutting duties and is able to make exact, square cuts. It\u2019s an affordable tool, making it more realistic than the horizontal saw or cold saw for a home shop setting. However, it can\u2019t make cuts as accurate as either of those tools can. Chop saws are high-powered. A great deal of heat is generated during the cut, making the steel extremely hot. Handle freshly cut steel with caution.

For cutting steel thicker than sheet metal, use the raker pattern. For thinner steel, use the wave tooth pattern. The blades get dull easily and need to be replaced to get proper accuracy. Band saws cut slowly and you may need to grind minor rough edges off after the cut is made. Band saws have a higher capacity than cold saws, but they don\u2019t cut as accurately."

If you\u2019re trying to choose between the two, make your decision based on how much steel you need to cut and how accurate you need to cut it. The cold saw is circular and its blade has a lot of teeth. The blade itself spins very slowly, but the cut is made quickly. A coolant is used with the cold saw to prevent the steel from heating up. The coolant should be immediately wiped off the steel after the cut is made."
