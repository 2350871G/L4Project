If you find a red tubby hanging on a tree, look under it. There should be a bowl of custard under it. Collect it! If you find a yellow tubby lying by the lake, proceed with caution. It will attempt to jump, scare you and will rise from laying down, look around and lay back down. There should be some of that delicious custard near it. If you find a green tubby inside a tubby house, you're in luck. He has been decapitated and there is blood everywhere. There should be some custard near him."
