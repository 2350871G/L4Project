The cube is the locking mechanism that keeps the tie from worming back out through the slot, so look for that."

  "text":" Unlocking the Tie Find the locking mechanism. If you look at a ready-to-use cable tie, notice that one end tapers to a point, while the other is capped with a tiny cube. When used, the pointy end is fed through a slot in the cube to form a loop and then pulled tight. The cube is the locking mechanism that keeps the tie from worming back out through the slot, so look for that. Bend the tie\u2019s loose end back. Notice how the loose end tends to curve over the locking mechanism once it\u2019s fed through it. You want access to that side of the cube, so bend the tie back to expose it some more. Depress the bar. Look underneath the loose end where it comes out of the cube. Use your fingernail or any tool you may need (like a nail or pocket-size screwdriver) to push down on the bar that you find there. This releases the locking mechanism. Pull the loose end back through the cube. Keep pushing down on the bar. As you do, use your other hand to slowly draw the loose end back through the cube. Once it\u2019s out, you\u2019re all done! Reusing Ties Refrain from trimming them. If you want to use the same tie over and over again for different things, don\u2019t cut the loose end off once it\u2019s in use. All that excess may be unsightly, but remember: once you snip it off, you\u2019ll only be able to use that tie for bundles of the same size or smaller. Anticipate wear and tear.

Freeing Yourself from Restraints Worm your hands out. First, be sure to squeeze your hands into fists with the tops of your hands facing up when your hands are being bound.
