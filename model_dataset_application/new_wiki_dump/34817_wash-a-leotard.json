          "description":"The source of the stain will play a role in how you get rid of it. A tomato-based stain, for instance, requires a different approach to removal than an ink stain. Removal tools include chalk, baking soda, peroxide, and vinegar, each of them ideally suited to a certain type of stain. Vinegar is great for whitening and removing grass stains. Oil stains (including face and body oils) are best removed with chalk or salt, as they absorb oil. Coffee and other dark stains are best removed with a 1:1 ratio of baking soda and water to make a paste. Peroxide is the most effective way to remove bloodstains, though it can have a bleaching effect."

If the stain is larger, enlist the help of a soft-bristle toothbrush (hard bristles can snag fabric) or a dedicated laundry brush with soft bristles."

Rinse the stained area with cool water, avoiding getting the rest of the garment wet, as this can cause the color or stain to run onto the rest of the fabric. If you are treating a leotard with many different colors, all of them prone to running, you can place your hand underneath the stain to make sure only that portion of the leotard gets wet."

Powdered detergent may not be able to break down fully in cool water and may snag your fabric, so liquid detergent is a must. Gentle detergents such as baby detergent are best for leotards, as the fibers present in leotards are quite delicate and easily damaged."

If your hands or the spoon still feel slimy, continue to stir. If the slimy feeling persists, you may have used too much detergent. You can dump out \u00bd-\u2154 of your mixture, and refill the basin the rest of the way with water."

If the color continues to bleed, make sure it does not stain any other suits by washing each of them separately. If you have a multi-colored leotard and see the color running, wash each side of the leotard separately, if possible. If the color continues to run and washing each color separately is not possible, you may need to have your leotard dry cleaned."

Do not bunch your leotard during this process; instead, place the fabric between your palms and rub your hands together. Keep moving down the fabric until the entire leotard has been washed in this manner."

Rinse until the water runs clear of both soap bubbles and color. Removing all of the soap from the fabric will help your leotard last longer. Leaving soap behind can result in the breakdown of fabric, and a loss of vibrant color."

Instead, press the water from the fabric using a towel or your hands, keeping the leotard in its original shape. Wringing your leotard can cause it to lose its shape and can damage the elastic and spandex in the fabric. If you are having trouble removing water on your own, you can hang your leotard to drain water over a bathtub or sink."

If you are using a hanger, pin the leotard to the hanger to avoid making \u201cdents\u201d in the fabric. If you are laying over a drying surface, quickly wipe it down to make sure you do not deposit dirt on your freshly-cleaned leotard. If your leotard has multiple colors, it should be laid flat to dry to prevent the colors from running together."
