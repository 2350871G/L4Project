          "description":"Ambiance refers to the tone, character, and atmosphere of an environment. Ambiance can strongly affect the mood that a room imbues. Think about the role you want the room to play in your life. Among the most important factors to consider are the following:\nWhat do you use the room for (watching TV, entertaining, reading, etc.)? What time of day you tend to use the living room? Are you hoping for the room to energize or relax you? Do you usually allow sunlight in through the windows?"

          "headline":"Take advantage of natural light.",
          "description":"There are certain color combinations meant for supremely sunny spaces. If the living room will be occupied during the day and is particularly well-lit by the sun, color the walls with saturated jewel tones or earthy shades. Bright tones, like a sapphire blue or emerald green look great in the sun. Similarly, dark earthy shades only work in spaces with a lot of natural light, since the light prevents the living room from looking too dark. Note that these colors tend to be overpowering in lower light, and should not be used in rooms that are not well lit. Keep in mind that if you put up wallpaper in a room with lots of natural light, it will fade over time."

          "description":"If, on the other hand, your living room doesn\u2019t get a good amount of sunlight, or you\u2019ll spend more time in your living room during the evening, there are certain colors than can help brighten the space up. Ivory and buttercup yellow can make a living room that does not receive much light look brighter, especially when these colors are prominently used. A space with low light can be made to look bright and cheery by using light greens and blues as well."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Create a warm space with warm tones.",
          "description":"A similar, though distinct, aspect to consider is a room\u2019s warmth. Deep reds, burnt oranges, and nearly all shades of gold and brown can be used to create a cozy, glowing space that is especially appropriate for a living room. These combinations are great for living rooms that are used both during the day and in the evening, as they emphasize comfort over energy, but aren\u2019t too dark for daytime use. Avoid using bright shades of red or orange as dominant or secondary colors, though, since these colors tend to carry too much energy and may seem overwhelming in excess. Earth tones, such as deep yellows, browns, and rusty reds, can warm up the space and look great in every light."

          "headline":"Relax the room with cool tones.",
          "description":"On the other hand, blues, cool violets, and grays are especially useful in creating a calm atmosphere capable of soothing you, your family, and your guests. If your living room tends to have occupants predominantly in the evening, cooling tones may be best, especially if you tend to relax in this space. Green is a good choice if you want to create a grounding and calming effect."

          "headline":"Opt for darker colors in a large room.",

If you have a large, open space, however, feel free to choose a deep hue, such as navy blue or plum.Generally, you should avoid painting an entire room a dark color. Stick with a single accent wall instead."

          "headline":"Follow the 60-30-10 rule.",
          "description":"Regardless of the colors you choose, it\u2019s helpful to plan how much space each color will account for. As a rule of thumb, 60% of your living room should be a dominant color, 30% should be a secondary color, and 10% should be an accent color. Choose dominant and secondary colors you're especially comfortable with. Know that your dominant color choice will greatly impact the room's feel. Don't choose a dominant or secondary color that you are not absolutely sure of. Only use bold colors as accent colors. A punch of powerful color can do wonders to the energy and character of a space. Make this sort of impact with your accent color. For a sense of vitality, make your accent color the brightest of your palette. Ensure that all 3 colors coordinate well with one another. Group your chosen colors together in a small trial area before committing to painting and decorating the whole room. You might want to use a neutral color as a base, like beige or gray, as they are versatile and classic."

        {
          "headline":"Match the color scheme of your furnishings.",
          "description":"For instance, if you have modern furniture and decorations, you will probably be better off with a modern color scheme of white, black, and gray than you would be with a traditional color scheme filled with rich hues. Alternatively, if you have older or more traditional furniture, use bright, modern colors for paint and accents to update the space. If your furnishings share a color scheme, complimenting that color with a secondary or accent color will tie the room together quite well."

          "headline":"Stick with white for a simple, clean option.",
          "description":"White is the safest bet there is. While some may prefer a more interesting dominant color, there\u2019s no denying that all-white or mostly-white color schemes can create a very clean, crisp living room. You can choose from a wide variety of \u201cwhite,\u201d such as off-white, cream, eggshell, grey-white, or antique white."

Light browns and soft grays can readily serve as dominant colors, and slightly darker shades of the same colors make great secondary and accent colors."

In general, create a modern living room by using neutral colors. White acts as the dominant color in most modern living rooms. Black or gray make great secondary colors. You can also add an intense, bright hue as an accent, such as a bright green or fire engine red."

Use neutral colors for walls and other dominant swaths of space, but weave in secondary and accent hues in rich shades of red, blue, or brown. You can even make the room seem more regal and traditional by choosing a \u201chistorical\u201d color like colonial yellow, hunter green, pearl gray, or Prussian blue."

Bring swatches and paint cards home to your living room, and hold them up in the spaces you\u2019re considering using them. Take advantage of this mini test run before you invest time and money in paint and furnishings.

Prominent pieces of art or furniture can greatly complement (and be complemented by) the color scheme you choose. Planning for what you intend to have in the room will also ensure that your color scheme coordinates with the most noticeable pieces in your living room. If you have a patterned couch, for instance, snatch colors from that pattern to create your overall color scheme. If you have a piece of artwork that you want to dominate the space, play to its prominence with the colors you choose. You might match your accent color to a prominent color featured in the piece, for instance. You could also get inspiration from a sculpture or accessory. Bring the item to the store with you to help you match paint, window treatments, or other furnishings to it."
