Plus, the more voices you have supporting you, the more likely you are to be heard by the people in charge of making energy-saving decisions at your school. Try organizing a group that is open to all students who want to work together to help the school save energy. If you are a student, walk or ride your bicycle to school whenever possible. You could then go a step further by inviting other students to join a group in school. You could also ask your teacher if they would spread the word and maybe even let you use the classroom for meetings. If you are a teacher, you could recruit students and help them by giving them ideas for how to save energy at school. One other great way to get students organized is to start an official school club. Check the student handbook or talk to an administrator at the school about how to get started."

If you are a student, you could create some signs on your own or with a few friends who are also interested in helping your school save energy. Make sure to get permission to hang the signs first. If you are a teacher, you could have your students create signs for a class project or homework assignment, and then go around posting the signs together. For example, you might hang up signs next to light switches around the school with reminders, like \u201cRemember to turn off the lights when you leave!\u201d"
