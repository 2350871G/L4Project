If you've been playing for a little longer than a couple hours, take some time to really limber out and consider getting something to eat, or doing anything else you haven't been able to do since you started playing. This quick break is mainly to take you out of the tightening moment of stress and give you momentary relief."

Take the time to really go back through your menu and make sure you have everything you need. If you don't, consider buying more items to heal or help you even if you want to conserve money; it's better to be overly equipped than understocked."
