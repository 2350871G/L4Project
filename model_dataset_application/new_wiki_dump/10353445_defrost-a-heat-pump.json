Properly functioning heat pumps may develop a thin coat of frost during cold weather. This is normal and nothing to worry about. However, if actual ice starts to build up on the heat-pump coils and on the top of the heat pump, you\u2019ll need to defrost the pump. Look outdoors by your home to find the heat pump. The heat pump is a large metal unit that looks very similar to an air conditioning unit."
