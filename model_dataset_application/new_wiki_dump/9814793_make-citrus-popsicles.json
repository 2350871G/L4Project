  "text":" Lemonade Popsicles Pour lemonade into four popsicle molds or plastic cups. Don't fill them up completely because when they are put in the freezer, the lemonade may go over the brim because it will expand. Place the popsicle sticks in the middle of each mold. Make sure not to spill any lemonade while you doing so. Freeze for about a day or until they are fully solid. If they are not solid after a day, leave them in the freezer for a bit longer. Enjoy!  Lemon and Lime Popsicles Pour one full cup of water into a measuring jug.  Squeeze one lemon and pour the juice of it into the jug with the water. If any seeds fall in, take them out. Squeeze a lime and pour the juice into the jug as well.  Put in half a teaspoon of caster sugar. Add in more or less sugar depending on how sweet you want it to be. Stir well until all the liquids are mixed together and the sugar has dissolved.  Pour the mixture into four popsicle molds. Do not overfill them. If you have too much, you can add the rest to another mold or drink it as it is. Place them in the freezer for a day. Leave them in the freezer until ready. Enjoy! Orange and Yogurt Popsicles Squeeze one orange and pour the juice into a jug.  Add in a cup of fat-free soya yogurt and blend until they are mixed together.  Sprinkle in one teaspoon of sugar and stir it in.  Pour the mixture into the molds.  Freeze for a day or until they are solid. Enjoy! Layered Popsicles Make the lime juice layer.

Squeeze one lemon and add a pinch of sugar. Pour it into the same molds on top of the frozen lime juice. Freeze for a further three hours. Make the orange juice layer. Squeeze a full orange. Pour the juice of the orange on top of the lemon and lime layers until it fills the molds enough so that it is nearly at the brim. Add in the popsicle sticks.
