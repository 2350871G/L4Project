This should be done with enough force to make a little bit of the soju splash out of the bottle. This portion of the bottle-opening ritual is meant to knock the sediment that was deposited during production out of the bottle so it doesn\u2019t get drank. Modern production of soju filters the alcohol, so sediment is no longer an issue. However, the tradition has remained."
