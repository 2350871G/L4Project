          "description":"Prepare a sharp knife or mandolin. Use the mandolin on the thinnest setting, or slice the sweet potato into rounds that are one-sixteenth to one-eighth inch (0.16 to 0.3cm) thick. A mandolin is ideal, because it will ensure all the rounds are the same thickness, which means they\u2019ll dehydrate at the same rate. To use a mandolin, press the top of the sweet potato to the mandolin slicer and move in a downward motion, slicing the sweet potato rounds until you reach the end of your potato. Use the vegetable holder to ensure you don\u2019t cut your hands on the sharp mandolin."

The starch in the sweet potato will prevent moisture from escaping, but soaking will help remove some of the starch, leading to crispier sweet potato chips. You can change the water halfway through the soaking process, but this step is not necessary."
