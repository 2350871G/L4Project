  "text":" Traditional Juice Spritzer Place a funnel into the mouth of an 8-ounce (250-milliliter) glass bottle. Make sure that the funnel can sit in the bottle firmly without moving around too much or falling out. Pour 4 ounces (125 milliliters) of your favorite flavor of juice into the funnel. Orange juice and grape juice are two of the most commonly used juices for spritzers, but any flavor\u2014apple, cranberry, pomegranate, mixed berry, tropical punch\u2014will work. Select a brand that is 100% juice over one made with a lot of extra sugar. Slowly pour 4 ounces (125 milliliters) of carbonated water through the funnel. Carbonated water refers to any type of fizzy water that contains bubbles of carbon dioxide. Mineral water is naturally fizzy and offers the most benefits, but it tends to be fairly expensive.

You can also use any other cap designed to plug or cover a bottle top. Combine the remaining ingredients into a second bottle. Pour in the juice, the carbonated water, and the sugar, and plug the bottle with a cork. Refrigerate the bottles or keep them in a bucket of ice. Serve shortly after making so that the spritzer does not lose too much of its \"fizz\" or carbonation. Juice Spritzer from Concentrate Place 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of frozen juice concentrate into an 8-ounce (250-milliliter) glass. You can use any flavor juice you want. The juice concentrate must be frozen, but if you cannot spoon out a solid spoonful, you may let it thaw slightly until it is soft enough to work with. Slowly pour 8 ounces (250 milliliters) of carbonated water over the concentrate. Seltzer will produce the purest taste, but any type of carbonated water will work. Pour the water directly over the frozen juice, allowing the juice to \"fizz\" or dissolve as you pour. Gently stir the spritzer with a spoon. Use a slow circular motion and stop once the frozen juice is completely dissolved. Stirring too fast or too long can lead to a drop in carbonation. Repeat the procedure with a second spoonful of concentrate. Drop the frozen juice concentrate into a glass and pour seltzer or other carbonated water over it. Stir until dissolved. Serve immediately. The drink should still be plenty cold from the juice concentrate, but you can add more ice if you want it even colder. Alcoholic Juice Spritzer Drop several ice cubes into a glass with a 1-pint (500-milliliter) capacity. Two to four ice cubes should be enough to keep the spritzer cold. Pour 1 cup (250 milliliters) of fruit juice into the glass. Use orange juice if you want to create a \"screwdriver\" spritzer, since a screwdriver is a cocktail commonly made with orange juice and vodka. You can experiment with other juices, as well. Add the carbonated water to the juice. Club soda will give your spritzer extra bite, but seltzer water works just as well. Dump in two shots of vodka. A standard shot glass is 1.5 ounces (44.4 milliliters), so you should add approximately 3 ounces (88.8 milliliters) to your juice spritzer. Gently stir the drink with a spoon. Use a slow circular motion, only stirring the drink a few times to combine it. Stirring too fast or too much will destroy too much of the carbonation. Split the drink into two separate 8-ounce (250-milliliter) glasses. Pour the juice spritzer and the ice into each glass slowly. Carefully allow the ice cubes to slip into the glass, but do not dump them into the glass since they may create an unnecessary splash upon doing so. Serve immediately. The longer you wait to drink to spritzer, the more carbonation it will lose.",
