They may have dolls they love and dolls they wish they never bought, so they can give you great tips and warnings. They might also have one that you don't like, so that you definitely know you won't be getting that one. Read online reviews of the dolls. What are other people who already own the dolls suggesting? And how good of a rating do the dolls have? Doing Your Research Check out a store, catalog or go to the American Girl website. In the store, you can see them in person to know for sure what they look like. Catalogs and websites are great, too. Read some of the doll's books, if she's a BeForever (historical) character or a Girl of the Year. The books let you know about their personality, if that's important to you. Borrow some of your friends dolls, if they have any. Try playing with their hair and playing with them in general. See which dolls you are starting to like and which dolls you know you don't want. Check YouTube. They have great videos on how to care for your dolls, which can influence your final decision. Making Your Choice Decide whether you want a doll you can use in any particular way. For example, the short hair may look cute, but you can't do many hairstyles. Long hair is fun, but it can be tough to take care of. Pick out the three or four American Girl dolls that you want the most.
