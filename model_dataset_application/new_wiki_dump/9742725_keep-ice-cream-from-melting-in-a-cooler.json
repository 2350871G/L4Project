          "description":"You can buy dry ice at most grocery stores for about $1.00-$3.00 USD per pound (0.45kg). Dry ice evaporates at a rate of about 5\u201310 pounds (2.3\u20134.5 kg) a day, so if you get it too far in advance, there won\u2019t be any left. Dry ice usually comes in 10 by 2 inches (25.4 cm \u00d7 5.1 cm) squares weighing about 10 pounds (4.5 kg). You'll need one square for every 15 inches (38 cm) of cooler length. You can make your own dry ice by spraying a CO2 fire extinguisher into a pillowcase for 2-3 seconds. Wear gloves, closed-toe shoes, and other protective gear if you try this yourself."

          "headline":"Choose an insulated cooler with an air vent.",
          "description":"Since dry ice creates vapor, make sure your cooler has an air vent or a valve that allows the gas to escape. If your cooler is completely airtight, the vapor will cause pressure to build up, which can lead to an explosion. If your cooler doesn't have a valve, leave the top open slightly. Plastic and styrofoam coolers are common options for storing dry ice."
