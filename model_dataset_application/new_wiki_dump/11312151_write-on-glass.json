Make sure to get  pens with an ink that is safe to use on glass, especially if you plan on using these for glassware that you eat off of. To make your markings permanent, you will have to let the acrylic paint cure for approximately 24 hours by setting the glass aside and not touching the markings until the paint has completely dried and set. If you need the paint to set faster, you can put the glass item in an oven to cure, as long as it is oven-safe and heat resistant. Once you finish writing on the glass, put it in a cool oven. Set the oven to 300 \u00b0F (149 \u00b0C) and let it warm up. Once it has reached 300 \u00b0F (149 \u00b0C), turn the oven off and let it cool down. The paint should now be set!"
