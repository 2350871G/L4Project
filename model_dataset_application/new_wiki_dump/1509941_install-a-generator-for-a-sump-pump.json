Small engines don't have catalytic converters so they produce much more poisonous exhaust than cars. To protect the running generator from heavy rain and the user from loose connections, some people make little roofs (which have no walls) or buy \"gen-tents\" (which look like little hats, not normal space enclosing tents) for them."
