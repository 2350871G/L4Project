          "description":"While getting kids to join the \u201cclean plate club\u201d might seem like a good idea, it can actually cause them to develop picky eating habits. Since being overfull can cause stomach pain or other gastrointestinal problems, children who've been encouraged to eat more than they need may slowly begin to dislike eating. The foods that children will want to stop eating first are likely the most important ones -- like vegetables!"

          "description":"New tastes, textures, and smells can be a little scary for children. Put very small portions of unfamiliar items on their plates, and don't make a big deal about the new arrival. You can also incorporate new foods into dishes that include items you know your kids like. For example, maybe your child has never had spinach. If you know they love creamy foods, try starting off with creamed spinach rather than a spinach salad."

You can also use cookie cutters to transform unappealing items into circles, stars, or squares. Tell your child they need to \u201ccollect\u201d each shape."

Persevere through the food battles and remind yourself that you're avoiding making more work for yourself over the long term. Unless they have a clinical disorder like ARFID, children will eventually eat when they're hungry."

Later, if they say don't like something, remind them that they chose it. This may be enough to get them to eat at least a few bites."

This can make them feel like sweets are the best foods, which they probably don't need more prompting to believe! It might also cause them to expect dessert after every meal.
