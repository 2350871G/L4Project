The tags should tell you the best process for cleaning your type of suede. For example, you should not use water on very fine suede, since the water will likely stain it. Other types of suede should only ever be cleaned with a suede eraser or brush and never any type of liquid."

If you notice that the stains or marks aren't coming up, slowly begin to apply more pressure as you rub the eraser back and forth. The suede eraser should bring up most of the marks and stains on your gloves. If you don\u2019t have a suede eraser, you can use a small pencil eraser for this step. You might notice that some eraser material comes off on the suede. This is normal, and you should be able to brush it right off of your gloves."
