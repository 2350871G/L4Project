If your cabinet is rectangular, use the width for this measurement. You'll want to ensure the Lazy Susan has about 2 inches of clearance all the way around, so that it can spin more effectively. As such, choose a Lazy Susan with a diameter about 2 inches shorter than your cabinet on each side. For a full-round Lazy Susan, this is the only measurement you'll need. As long as its diameter is a few inches shorter than the width of your cabinet, it will fit comfortably in your cabinet."

  "text":" Measuring for a D-Shaped or Full-Round Lazy Susan Make sure your cabinet is a 45 degree corner or straight cabinet. The former is found in the kitchen corner, usually sitting at a 45 degree angle between two walls. Straight cabinets are more typical and found throughout the kitchen. Measure for the diameter of the Lazy Susan. If your cabinet is a perfect square, stretch a tape measure from one wall to the opposite wall for this diameter. If your cabinet is rectangular, use the width for this measurement. You'll want to ensure the Lazy Susan has about 2 inches of clearance all the way around, so that it can spin more effectively. As such, choose a Lazy Susan with a diameter about 2 inches shorter than your cabinet on each side. For a full-round Lazy Susan, this is the only measurement you'll need. As long as its diameter is a few inches shorter than the width of your cabinet, it will fit comfortably in your cabinet. Measure the depth of your cabinet. Since a D-Shaped Lazy Susan has a flat side, its depth will be slightly shorter than the diameter. Check the hardware specifications for the Lazy Susan you plan to order; this will let you know what kind of depth you need for the cabinet. Starting a few inches in from the cabinet opening, use a tape measure to get the cabinet's depth. This will give you an idea of where the Lazy Susan will sit in the cabinet. Measure your cabinet's opening. This measurement needs to fit the length of the D-shaped Lazy Susan's flat side to ensure it sits comfortably within the cabinet. Start at one end of the cabinet opening and measure to the other: no need to subtract inches here. Measure the cabinet's inside height. While most Lazy Susans come with a telescoping central shaft, they usually have a minimum and maximum cabinet height requirement. To take this measurement, start with your tape measurer at the very bottom of the cabinet measuring up to the very top. Measuring for a Half-Round Lazy Susan Ensure you have a blind corner kitchen cabinet. Half-round (also known as half moon) Lazy Susans are designed specifically for these cabinets, which are quite long. These are the kinds of cabinets that have only one door occupying half of their length. The half-round Lazy Susan is typically attached to the door, sliding out as it is opened. Keep in mind that if your kitchen cabinets have face frames, you'll need to allow more leeway in the below measurements for the Lazy Susan to open properly. Use a retractable tape measure to find the cabinet's inside depth. Stretch it along the underside of the cabinet, from the left wall to the right. Set it in place, lock it and record the measurement. For the best fit, you'll typically want a Lazy Susan with a total length one or two inches shorter than this measurement. Measure the depth of your cabinet.

You'll want the Lazy Susan's radius to be a bit shorter than the depth of your cabinet, usually between 3 to 4 inches. Check the size of your cabinet's opening. Stretch a measuring tape over the opening and note the measurement. Make sure it is slightly larger than the radius of the Lazy Susan. This will ensure the Lazy Susan has sufficient space to swivel out as you open the cabinet doors. Finish by measuring the inside height of the cabinet. While half-round Lazy Susans come with a metal shaft that adjusts to various cabinet heights, they usually have a minimum and maximum height. Measure the inside of your cabinet, bottom to top, and ensure it falls within this range. Measuring for a Kidney Shaped Lazy Susan Find an L-shaped corner cabinet. These cabinets are found in kitchen corners and have folding doors. Kidney shaped Lazy Susans are designed specifically for these cabinets. Ensure you have a cabinet fitting this description before attempting to measure it. Measure from the corner of the cabinet opening to the back wall. Place the tape measure at the opening, and stretch it until it touches the back wall. Record this measurement, which will usually be about 10 inches shorter than the Lazy Susan's diameter. Measure the depth of the cabinet. This can be done by placing a tape measure on either side of the cabinet's opening, where the wall ends. Starting here, stretch out the tape measure until it touches the opposite wall of the cabinet. Record this measurement as the cabinet's depth. As the Lazy Susan needs about an inch or 2 of clearance on either side to rotate smoothly, the depth of your cabinet minus 3 to 4 inches will give you the maximum diameter your cabinet can fit for a Lazy Susan. Use the depth of your cabinet to find its center. Repeat the previous step, as if you were measuring the cabinet's depth. Dividing this measurement by two will help you find the center. Mark this point with a pencil. Then use a ruler to draw a straight line, perpendicular to the measurement you just took, connecting this point to the far wall of the cabinet. Next, use your tape measure to measure the cabinet's depth once more, this time from the opposite side of your cabinet's opening. This means the tape measure should now run perpendicular to the measurement you previously took. Divide this measurement by two, finding its center. Mark this point with a pencil. Now draw a line from this point, away from the cabinet's opening, perpendicular to the measurement you just took. The lines you've drawn should now intersect at one point. This is the center of the cabinet. Measure the distance from the center of the cabinet to the inset corner of the cabinet's opening. From the center you've drawn, bring your tape measure to the corner of the cabinet's opening in a straight line. Compare this measurement to the minimum requirement on the Lazy Susan you plan to install. Measure the distance between the cabinet's opening and the center. Start with a tape measure at the cabinet's opening and run it along the inside wall until it lines up with the cabinet's center. This measurement will also need to be compared to the minimum requirements for the Lazy Susan, so it spins smoothly in the cabinet. You can erase the pencil lines after taking this measurement. Finish by measuring the cabinet's inside height. Start from the very bottom of the cabinet, stretching a tape measure until it touches the top. Compare this to the height range for the Lazy Susan.",
