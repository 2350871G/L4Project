If the curry is still too spicy, continue adding a spoonful of either ingredient and tasting it to see if it improves the flavor. Be careful not to add too much sour cream or yogurt, as this may make the consistency of the curry too thick."

Add 1 US tbsp (15 ml) of coconut milk to the curry sauce, and taste it to see if it has helped. Simply add another spoonful or two if the first wasn't enough, and keep tasting the curry to see if the flavor has improved."

Pour 1 US tbsp (15 ml) of milk into the pot that has the curry sauce in it, and mix it in to combine it with the other ingredients. Taste the curry after you add the milk. If it hasn't reduced the spiciness enough, add a bit more and try it again. Don't add too much milk at one time, as it could change the consistency of the curry and make it watery. Whole fat milk is the best to add to curries."
