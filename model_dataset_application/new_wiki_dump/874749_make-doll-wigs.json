You can choose any weight of yarn that you want. A fine yarn is closest to the thickness of hair and will lay more naturally, but you will need more of it to complete the project. On the other hand, you could use a bulky yarn and simply unwind the strands once the hair piece is sewn into place. It's completely up to you."

Ideally, you probably should wrap the yarn along the length of the cardboard until it is at least three strands deep. The end product will probably look about the way it does on the cardboard, so if it looks thin there, then add more yarn."

But if the doll will be a child\u2019s toy, make sure that you sew the felt securely. To that end, you can also do two seams, one down each side of the felt beneath the yarn hair. To adapt this process for a boy doll, simply make several wefts using shorter yarn. Attach them to the doll\u2019s head in horizontal rows, beginning in the front and adding more close together until you reach the nape of the neck. If desired, you can lay the hair flat and glue it to the head of the doll. Or you might consider doing this with a few strands in the front, so that the doll has a fixed hairline. Just use a white craft glue that will be flexible when dry."
