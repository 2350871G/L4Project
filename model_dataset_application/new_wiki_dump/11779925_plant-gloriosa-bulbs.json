If you are afraid your region might get frost again, consider planting your bulbs in pots to keep them indoors. In warmer zones of the United States, like zones 8 through 10, gloriosa bulbs may be able to survive all year long. In colder zones, like 1 through 7, they need to be planted in the spring time after the threat of frost has passed."

If it does, add 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) of organic material, like peat moss or compost, on top of the soil to add drainage.Warning: All parts of the gloriosa lily are poisonous, so choose a spot away from animals and small children. Clay soil does not drain well, so you shouldn\u2019t use it to plant your bulbs. If you are planting your bulbs in pots, choose medium potting soil and make sure your pots have holes in the bottom for drainage. Try planting your lilies with dill, marigolds, or geraniums. These plants have shallow roots, so they won\u2019t interfere with your gloriosa bulbs."
