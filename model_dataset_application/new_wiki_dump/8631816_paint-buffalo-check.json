Clean the wall with a damp cloth, then allow it to dry. When you\u2019re ready, pour the paint into a tin paint pan. Roll the brush in the paint. Slowly roll the brush across the wall in \u201cW\u201d shapes of varying sizes to get the entire wall the right color."

          "description":"When your wall is dry, cut a piece of cardboard stock to the exact dimensions you wish each square in your buffalo check pattern to be. Starting at the top left corner of the wall, use a pencil to lightly trace the bottom edge of the square. When you\u2019re finished, slide the square down so that its top edge directly abuts the bottom edge of the square above. Continue working your way down the column. There\u2019s no need to trace the entire square. Just run your pencil along the bottom edge at regular intervals, keeping the left edge against the corner of the room. For best results, your squares should be about seven to 12 inches on each side."

          "description":"A laser level is a device that emits a laser beam from a stable point. Simply align the laser level in such a way that it draws a steady line straight across the wall and along the first line you drew. As you proceed down the wall toward progressively lower lines, you\u2019ll have to adjust the laser level accordingly. You can get a laser level at your local hardware store. They can be quite affordable, though a range of prices exist. More functional laser levels will be more expensive, and more basic levels will be less expensive. Tripod-mounted laser levels will rotate from a central axis across a given line that you select. Stationary laser levels must be held or attached to a wall or other surface and manually set at the height you wish to draw straight across."

Once you\u2019re done, adjust your laser level so that it traces a line straight across your wall consistent with the second line in the column of horizontally-oriented lines you made using the cardboard square. Instead of applying the bottom edge of this piece of tape to the laser line, though, attach the tape along the line so that its top edge touches it. Run the tape all the way across the wall just as you did with the first strip of tape. Continue down the column in this way, placing your painter\u2019s tape directly above, then directly below the laser lines you trace across the wall."

Paint the wider strips using a roller brush in the same way you painted the wall the first time. Be careful not to paint beyond the boundary marked by the painter\u2019s tape. When your paint is still wet, strip off the painter\u2019s tape. This prevents potential cracking or peeling that might occur if you strip the tape off when the paint is dry."
