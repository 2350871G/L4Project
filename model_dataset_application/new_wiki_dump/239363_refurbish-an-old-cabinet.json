It's still very old as indicated by the 16\u201d wide clear pine lumber used in the flour bins."

      "description":"Strip the old paint, or in this case, the old linoleum finish. If the top is in usable condition, it can be refinished, or as an alternative, apply ceramic tile, or even laminate flooring for a beautiful new look. If you decide to enlarge the top (for example, to make an eating area), more of the same type of lumber must be acquired to extend it (preferably wood that matches the old), or a new top must be built. This piece received a new top made from old barn wood so that a breakfast bar could be added to one side."

      "headline":"Begin removing the old paint using the hot air gun (heat stripper).",
      "description":"Keep the gun moving in a circular or back and forth motion so that you do not scorch the wood. Work in small areas and as the paint begins to bubble, use the putty knife to scrape up the paint. Be careful not to scratch or gouge the wood. As one section of paint begins to bubble, hold the gun in front of the knife, and gently push the putty knife forward. Slowly continue to move the gun forward while scraping. The hot air gun will only remove paints and varnishes, it will not remove stain."
