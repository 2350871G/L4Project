If you\u2019re looking down (or on your phone), look up and try to make eye contact with other people. Smile and look friendly. If you appear open and friendly, people are more likely to approach you. Stand near the action of the room. If you're standing far from the crowd, it may be harder for people to approach you."

Make a point to ask open-ended questions so that the person can elaborate on their answers and build on the conversation. You\u2019ll get to know each other better and keep the conversation going.

This will help you observe what other people are doing and if you want to meet other interesting people present at the party. Moving can help you seem alluring to others and might keep people guessing. Aim to move every 10-15 minutes or so."

It may be easy to talk to people while you play the game and being in a smaller circle can make you feel more comfortable. Put on some music and get people to dance.
