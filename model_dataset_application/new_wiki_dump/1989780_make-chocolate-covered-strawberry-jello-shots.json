  "text":" Dipping the Strawberries Hull your strawberries. Using your dominate hand, stick the inch of a pairing knife near the strawberry's stem at a 45 degree angle. Carve the knife around the stem in one direction and then repeat in the other direction. The core of the strawberry should come out on its own, leaving a small hollowed out area in the strawberry you will later fill with jello. Drain the juice. Set the strawberries on a plate or tray with the cut side down. Place the plate or try aside while you prepare the chocolate. This allows any excess juice to drain from the chocolate. Melt one cup (240 mL) of the chocolate discs. Measure your chocolate discs into a microwave-safe bowl. Place the bowl in the microwave and heat it on medium heat for one minute. Then, remove the bowl from the microwave and stir. Heat the bowl for an additional 15 seconds and then stir again. Continue heating your chocolate for 15 second intervals until it's all fully melted. Dip the strawberries in the chocolate. Once your chocolate is melted, your strawberries should be drained. One by one, hand dip them in the chocolate-mixture tip first. Coat the strawberries completely in chocolate. Set the strawberries, cut-side down, on a baking tray covered in parchment paper after dipping them. Balance a disc on the tip of the strawberries. Place a chocolate disc on the tip of each strawberry. The melted chocolate should hold the disc in place. When done, the discs help the strawberry shots stand upright. Place the strawberries in the freezer. Freezing the strawberries helps the chocolate harden. While the strawberries are freezing, you can prepare your jello. The chocolate should be hardened by the time you're done with the jello. Mixing the Jello Combine the jello powder and hot water. Pour your water into a mixing bowl. Then, add the gelatin powder. Stir the powder into the water until the jello is completely dissolved. Times will vary depending on the precise heat of your water, but jello usually melts within a few minutes. Mix in the vodka. Once the gelatin is dissolved into the water, pour in your vodka. Use a mixing spoon to stir in the vodka until you have an even, consistent mixture. Transfer your mixture to a measuring cup. Pick a measuring cup that has a tip on the end. This helps you pour the gelatin mixture into your shots. Assembling the Shots Stand up your strawberry glasses. Remove the strawberry glasses from the freezer. Turn them upside down, using the chocolate disc as a stand, so the cut-side is facing up. Fill the strawberry glasses with the jello mixture. Slowly pour your gelatin mixture into each of the strawberry glasses, filling them just to the brim. Try to get an equal amount of gelatin in each glass. Refrigerate your shots for several hours until they're set. It usually takes a few hours for the gelatin to firm, but times vary depending on your fridge. Keep the shots refrigerated until the jello is firm and slightly jiggly. Store shots in the fridge. It's best to serve your shots the day they're made. Keep them in the fridge until it's time to serve them. Strawberries will keep for one to three days in the fridge.",
