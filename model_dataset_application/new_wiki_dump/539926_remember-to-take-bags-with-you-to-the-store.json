This excess layer of packaging costs energy and money to produce, and bags are bound to end up in a landfill, if not litter, sooner or later. A simple place to start is to have a good look at how many you have around. Perhaps you reuse them for certain things; perhaps you recycle them or throw them away.

Regardless of where you get your bags, choose a size that is comfortable and a design that is sturdy and pleasing. Have at least enough for a full load of groceries. Your reusable bag (or bag substitute) can be whatever is most convenient for you. It could be your backpack or panniers if you ride a bike. Choose what works and pleases you. A reusable bag can also be insulated, such as a quilted or padded bag or an insulated, soft-sided cooler for your frozen goods. A large basket is an excellent choice for some items, especially if you like to shop at a farmer's market. There are European made canvas collapsible shopping baskets that can be purchased from stores that sell bags or carrying items. Making your own bags is a great excuse to salvage beautiful prints from clothing and other fabric items that are worn out or no longer fit but that you'd like to keep as a memento. The fabric still gets to be seen and you've got a useful item again!"
