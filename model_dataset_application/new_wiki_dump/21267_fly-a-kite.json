Single line kites are most suitable for light to medium winds. However, if you want to fly your single line kite in stronger winds, then add a tail to it. When choosing a tail for your kite, choose one that is made of lightweight materials."

Choose one of these kites if you want something a little more challenging than the delta or diamond kite. They need stronger winds to fly, about 8 to 25 mph winds. Parafoil kites usually contain tunnel-like passage ways for wind to pass through."

You can fly dual line kites in light, moderate, and heavy winds. Additionally, with two lines, the flier has more control over the kite. You can also do maneuvers and tricks, like loops, with dual line kites."

Insert the spine and crossbars, and attach the string per the instruction manual. Make sure to check the guidelines to determine the ideal wind speed for the kite. Face away from the wind. Hold up your kite by the bridle. The bridle is the two or three strings that attach to the kite and the kite line. Hold it up until it catches the wind. Let out some line.

Insert the spine into the slot at the nose, i.e, the tip of the kite. Attach the upper and lower spreaders to their connecting pieces on the leading edges. Connect the standoffs to the trailing edges. Make sure to attach the flying lines with a slip knot. Stand with your back toward the wind. Place your kite on the ground. The bottom of the kite should be facing up. The bottom of the kite is the side where the kite strings attach to the kite. Alternatively, have a friend hold the kite up in the air for you.
