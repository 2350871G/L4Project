  "text":" Step 1: Prepare the Perfect Beans Find a roast and bean supplier you love Support small farmers from around the world and purchase fair trade coffee beans. Buy organic beans; they are not only healthier for you, but for the environment too. Try beans from different locations around the world. Countries in Central America, Ethiopia, and Indonesia are a few of the leading areas for prime coffee beans. Find espresso beans whose taste you love Coffee beans grow in three types: Arabica, Robusta, and Java. Arabica is typically preferred by most, but try them all to find your favorite. Not all espresso is dark roast (like Starbucks provides). Taste different roasts to find what suits your buds best. Purchase and use beans in small batches You aren\u2019t likely to use beans purchased in bulk quickly enough for them to retain their flavor. Beans begin to oxidize and go stale shortly after being roasted. They will lose their flavor the older they get. Buying small supplies of beans allows you to try many different roasts and flavors over time. Step 2: Grind the Beans Always grind espresso fresh and immediately before use. The flavor will remain intact more wholly in a complete bean than in grounds. Adjust the coarseness of the grind to fit your espresso machine. The grounds should not exceed the size of white table sugar. Don\u2019t grind too little or too much \u2013 just enough beans to fill the portafilter.  Step 3: Prepare the Espresso Machine Be sure the espresso machine is turned on and there is the correct amount of water pressure.  Clean out the portafilter. There should be no old excess grounds or dirty water remaining in the basket. Heat the shot glass and portafilter by turning on the hot water and running them under for five to ten seconds.  Step 4: Tamp the Espresso Beans Overfill the portafilter until you have a centered mountain of grinds, and then knock the portafilter 4-6 times to loosen grounds from the side.  Center the tamper on the now flat grounds and make sure it is level with the basket.  Push down with the tamper to compact the grounds. It is necessary to apply about 30lbs of force. While pushing down on your final tamp pressure, pivot your elbow clockwise to polish the surface of the grounds.  Step 5: Pull Your Espresso Lock the portafilter with tamped grounds into the espresso machine. Make sure the shot glass(es) is positioned under the pour. Time to pull a shot! Press the pump button and start timing. The critical measurements of a double shot are 2.5 ounces total volume in 18-25 seconds. If your shot is pulling fast or slow, adjust the coarseness and tamp and try again. The crema \u2013 rust colored foam \u2013 should take up the majority of the shot glass. The heart \u2013 dark brew-colored liquid \u2013 should take up the smallest space of the glass. If this is disproportionate, adjust the coarseness and tamp and pull another shot. A light tan crema indicates under-extraction or low water temperature. Catch fresh shots in a demitasse or other small cup and enjoy! ",
