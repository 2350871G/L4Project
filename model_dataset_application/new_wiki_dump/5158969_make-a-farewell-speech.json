          "description":"Think about the overall experience you\u2019ve had at the place that you\u2019re leaving. It may be a job, a school, a volunteer position, or a place that you\u2019ve lived for a long time. Try to think of what you\u2019ve done while there, and how you would tell the story of your time there from beginning to end. Try writing down a narrative history of your time at this place. It doesn\u2019t have to all be appropriate for a speech. Simply write it down to help yourself remember everything you\u2019ve done, and to help yourself realize what has been the most meaningful to you. Your narrative may start with something like, \u201cI came to work here right out of college and had never lived on my own before. I was so shy that I didn\u2019t make any friends for nine months. Then I got that promotion a year later and formed close bonds within my new department.\u201d\nIt\u2019s okay to write down things that were difficult. You can edit them out later. You might include something like, \u201cI hated when we had to move to the new office.\u201d When you edit your speech, this may turn into a funny anecdote, or maybe you\u2019ll say something like, \u201cEven when we had to move to the new office, I couldn\u2019t help but notice how cheerful my colleagues managed to be in a hard time.\u201d"

An anecdote can be funny or touching, but it should be a short, specific story that helps paint a picture of everyday life while conveying your thoughts or feelings overall. An anecdote might start out something like this: \u201cI\u2019ll always remember my third day of school. Spencer and I had been assigned to sit next to each other on the bus, but on the third day, my grandmother followed me onto the bus and declared she\u2019d need to have a word with Spencer\u2026\u201d\nAnecdotes can be great ways to express appreciation for a specific person, or to illustrate something you appreciate about the place as a whole. For example, the above anecdote might end with something like, \u201c...and of course, he\u2019s never left my side since then,\u201d or, \u201c...which is how I knew that this school community would finally be a place that I\u2019d feel at home.\u201d"

People will appreciate you being reflective for a bit and sharing your feelings about the occasion. Think of things you\u2019re grateful for, or moments that helped you become who you are. Make a note of something like, \u201cwhen John stood up for me freshman year,\u201d or, \u201cwhen the boss actually brought my proposal to the board and I realized that my voice mattered.\u201d\nThink about the reasons you\u2019re sad to go. This could be something like, \u201cI know that a group of people who look out for each other like this is a rare thing to find,\u201d or, \u201cI learned so much from each person here, it will be sad to move on without everyone.\u201d"

You can offer wishes for the group in general, such as, \u201cOf course, next year, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll all finally get to nationals without me on the team.\u201d\nYou can also offer individual good wishes, such as, \u201cJanet, I hope you have an easy transition to being vice president; I know you\u2019ll do great.

An example of \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d is saying, \u201cOn my first day of work, I noticed that half of the office stayed an extra half hour after closing time to make sure the reports were done,\u201d instead of, \u201cEveryone here always works extra hard.\u201d"
