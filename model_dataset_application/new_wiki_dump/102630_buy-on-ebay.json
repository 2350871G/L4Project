Does the listing tell you if the item is new or used? If these things are not clear, or you have questions, e-mail the seller and ask for clarification. What the seller tells you becomes part of the sale deal and provides a reason for return if the seller misleads you. It is better to be aware of everything than to throw away money in the hope the item will live up to your expectations."

There is also no harm in e-mailing the seller for extra photos if desired, along with any questions you have about the images. Pay extra attention to the condition of the item in the photos. Are they only showing the picture of the box? You should be able to see the condition of the item in detail."

Anything above 95% is usually an indication that the seller is good - some negative feedback is to be expected in the world of sales and may simply be a reflection of a difficult customer or someone who had expectations that were unrealistic. Check how many transactions the seller has performed. While it may not be wrong to do business with someone with only a few transactions (they may be new! ), you are more likely to receive good service from sellers that have performed a large number of sales. A seller with a lot of sales will usually process your order faster and work to ensure that you are satisfied."

If you are bidding, as opposed to buying immediately, it gives you an indication of how much you should be willing to bid. You can perform a Completed Listings search by clicking the \"Advanced\" link next to the search bar. Check the \"Completed listings\" box in the \"Search including\" section.

          "description":"The entire eBay system revolves around buyers and sellers leaving feedback for each other after the completion of a transaction. Leaving feedback for sellers after a transaction is considered good etiquette. Use the feedback to let other buyers know if the seller is reliable. Feedback options include:\nPositive: You are satisfied with the transaction and would likely buy from that seller again. Neutral: You may have some issues with the sale process but not enough to leave a negative. Negative:  Something about the sale disappointed or upset you. Before leaving negative feedback, always try to contact the seller and seek resolution. Most sellers will try to remedy any errors that they have caused because they value their feedback status. Many now offer refunds and in some cases, you may be able to reach a compromise that makes both sides happy. If you cannot reach a resolution, eBay can also intervene for you. After trying a reasonable amount to resolve the issue and you still have no happy outcome, leave a factual message as to why you found the transaction to be negative. Avoid abuse or inflammatory statements; these reflect badly on you and may cause future sellers to block you."
