If your doll has straight hair, use her hairbrush to gently brush out any tangles. If you have a curly-haired doll, use a special pick so you don\u2019t mess up her curls. You can braid your doll\u2019s hair, put it in ponytails, add bows and ribbons, or create your very own style! Try to create a hairstyle that matches your doll\u2019s outfit. If she\u2019s wearing a fancy dress, for instance, you might want to leave her hair down, but if she\u2019s dressed in a more casual style, you might put her hair into pigtails."
