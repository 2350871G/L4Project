It is important to take advantage of your civilization's strong points, as well as creating more pikemen to fend off the knights. Other units that you could create are long swordsmen, mangonels, crossbowmen, and cavalry archers (created at the Archery Range, not the Stable). {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/a4\\/Win-in-Age-of-Empires-II-Step-19.jpg\\/v4-460px-Win-in-Age-of-Empires-II-Step-19.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/a4\\/Win-in-Age-of-Empires-II-Step-19.jpg\\/aid1517927-v4-728px-Win-in-Age-of-Empires-II-Step-19.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nKnights of your own should also be created to attack your enemy's lumberjacks, miners, etc. in an effort to slow down their economy.Scorpions can be useful support weapons in defending against a late castle rush. As the bolts penetrate multiple layers of units, their damage can be amplified. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/e5\\/Play-As-the-Goths-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-12Bullet4.jpg\\/v4-460px-Play-As-the-Goths-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-12Bullet4.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/e5\\/Play-As-the-Goths-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-12Bullet4.jpg\\/aid1517927-v4-728px-Play-As-the-Goths-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-12Bullet4.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Trade resources in the market. Use the market to your advantage - you can brute force the 1000 food or 800 gold requirement. Once you have the necessary resources, click on the Imperial Age button in your Town Center. The research takes a few minutes. A common goal in researching the Imperial Age that neglects your military (Wonder Race) is 25:00. Consider this an absolute zero - if you develop your military in any way, you will miss this goal. It takes practice to shorten the time you reach Imperial Age. The times can vary from 25:00 to 31:00, and that is what you should be aiming for.",
