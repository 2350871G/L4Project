Choose the spot where it's easy to escape and there is cover to conceal you from enemy fire when the enemies are alerted to your presence. If you are playing multiplayer, pick a sniping spot overlooking a road, a city or open field that is heavily traveled by enemies."

      "description":"Kneel (Q or page up / left analog stick) or go into a prone position (Z / Y) to make your silhouette less noticeable and to lessen the scope sway. If there are bushes around your sniping spot, use them to your advantage. If you walk backwards into the bush and leave only the barrel of the rifle sticking out; it will be very hard for both enemy players and A.I. to spot you. Spot enemy units. To spot enemies, center them on your crosshair and press V / the right analog stick. This will help friendly A.I to find hidden enemies and engage them and it will also help friendly players by marking enemies on the map as red circles (press M / the black button to display the map, radio, compass, GPS and the notebook which contains your objectives, notes, squad information and gear). Every big square on the map grid is composed by 10x10 small squares. Each small square is 130 meters and the distance across each big square is 1 kilometer and 300 meters."

      "headline":"Calculate bullet drop and trajectory.",
      "description":"When you see the target you need to calculate and adjust your aiming for bullet drop and trajectory distance. Keep in mind that the rifle with the most bullet drop in the game is the CZ550 used by the Resistance faction (called hunting rifle in game; on the Xbox version you need to play through 50% of the main campaign to unlock Resistance). The rifle with the least bullet drop is the M21, used by the West faction (The M21 jumps a bit when you shoot so aim lower than you would with other rifles; otherwise, if you aim for the head, the bullet will just whiz past the top of the enemy's head). If the target is farther than 400 meters you will probably need to aim above the head in order to hit it, and if the target is moving you will also need to lead the shot ahead of it. M21 Bullet Drop Calculation: In order to hit a target which is 300 meters away, align the target's head just above the center of the scope. For 500 meters align the targer's head just below the center of the scope. For 780 meters align the upper chest (just below the neck) of the target with the horizontal line below the center of the scope. For 1 kilometer adjust the head in the middle of the vertical line between the thicker line of the scope and the horizontal line below the center of the scope. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/00\\/SrM21.jpg\\/460px-SrM21.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/00\\/SrM21.jpg\\/728px-SrM21.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Fair_use\\\">Fair Use<\\/a> (screenshot)<br>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\n\nSVD Dragunov Bullet Drop Calculation: For a distance of 330 meters, align the target's head on the top of the first chevron.

Enemies will know you're there and they will try to flank you (the A.I. is especially good at that, they will try to break your line of sight, go around you and attack from both flanks).
