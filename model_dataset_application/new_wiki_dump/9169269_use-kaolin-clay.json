          "description":"Kaolin can make a soothing, gently exfoliating facial cleanser. It is even mild enough to be used daily. To wash your face with kaolin, gently wet your skin with warm water. Massage a pinch of clay into your skin, letting it stand for about a minute. Then, wash your face with clean, warm water and continue with your daily toning and moisturizing routine."

          "description":"Kaolin clay is great for absorbing oils and treating whiteheads. There are a number of ways you can make a Kaolin clay mask. The easiest way is to simply mix the clay with enough water to get it to a thin paste consistency. Leave it on until it dries, about 10 to 15 minutes, then rinse it off. You could also make a more healing clay mask by adding other ingredients. Use two teaspoons of clay, two teaspoons of aloe vera, and a couple drops of tea tree oil to make a potent acne mask or a mask to treat oily skin. Mix three tablespoons of clay, two tablespoons each of lavender and chamomile, and a quarter of a cup of colloidal oatmeal to make a mask for treatments on sensitive skin."

          "headline":"Make a facial scrub.",
          "description":"Washing your face with kaolin will provide very mild exfoliation. Adding kaolin to a facial scrub will help balance gentle and intense exfoliation. Add two to three tablespoons of clay to a quarter of a cup of white sugar and approximately three tablespoons of melted coconut oil to make a simple scrub that is gentle on your skin. Add the oil a little bit at a time until the scrub is a thick paste. It may take a little less or a little more than the recommended amount depending upon your sugar and clay. Store your excess scrub in a sealed container in the fridge for up to three months."

          "description":"Adding a little kaolin clay to your bath can help soften dry skin. Draw yourself a hot bath and add a quarter to half a cup of kaolin clay, mixing gently with your hand or a large spoon to ensure it dissolves fully. Mix well, or you could end up with clumps of clay in your drain or in your pipes. To make your bath extra indulgent, add a few drops of your favorite essential oil for an aromatic experience. Lavender is great for relaxing, while some find that citrus oils can be healing for dry or discolored skin."

Use a fluffy powder brush to dust a small amount of clay on your scalp, focusing on your part. To make the most of your dry shampoo, apply it before your hair gets oily or greasy. That way the clay can absorb sweat and sebum as it develops. Try to only apply the clay once between showers. Adding too much clay could result in a cakey look or clumps in your hair."

Mix a wash by adding warm water to one to three tablespoons of kaolin, depending upon your hair length. The mixture should make a runny paste. Apply to your hair and let stand for one to two minutes before rinsing it out in clean, warm water. Use a strong brew of your favorite herbs or tea instead of water to add some stimulating properties and antioxidants to your rinse."
