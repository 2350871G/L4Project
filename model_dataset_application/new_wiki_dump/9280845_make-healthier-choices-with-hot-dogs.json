White buns are often high in sodium too. Wrap your dog in a whole grain bun instead for added fiber and other nutrients. Want an even healthier wrapper for your dog?

Stick to fresh, low-sodium condiments, such as salsa, to add big flavor. Can't give up your traditional hot dog condiments? Go with low-sodium ketchup, mustard, relish, or sauerkraut to keep your dog healthy. If using ketchup be mindful of the added sugar. Grab a bottle of sugar-free ketchup instead\u2014it still tastes the same, but it's much healthier. You can also make your own using healthy ingredients."

Want even more intense flavor? Mix some fresh herbs and spices, such as cumin, cilantro, or scallions, into your veggie toppings."
