Since you don\u2019t want to ruin the surprise for your mom, ask your dad. If that\u2019s not an option, try asking a family member that your mom is close to, like an aunt or grandparent. It\u2019s good to have someone else on board who can help plan the party and also advise you on your mom\u2019s likes and dislikes. If your mom doesn't like surprise parties, brainstorm alternative ways to celebrate your mom."

          "description":"The most important step in planning a surprise party is picking the date; this will inform the rest of your party planning decisions. Think about what the party is for \u2013 is it a surprise birthday party? A surprise Mother\u2019s Day party? A surprise party to show your mom how much you appreciate her? If you\u2019re celebrating a specific thing, like a birthday or Mother\u2019s Day, try to pick a Saturday night near the date you\u2019re celebrating. Check your mom\u2019s calendar to make sure she doesn\u2019t have any plans that would conflict with the party. If your mom doesn\u2019t have a calendar, ask your dad or one of your mom\u2019s friends to check to make sure the date is okay (make sure you let them know it\u2019s a surprise!)"

          "description":"In order to effectively throw this party, you need to know how much money you have available to you. Ask your dad, a relative, or one of your mom\u2019s friends to help you plan the budget for the party. Make sure to factor in things like the venue, food, drinks, decorations, invitations and cake. If you\u2019re working with a small budget, figure out how many of these things you can do yourself to save money. There may be small ways you can cut costs. Instead of sending out physical invitations, you could try inviting people online via email or social media. You could also consider throwing a potluck to cut down on the costs of catering."

          "description":"Decide how big you want the party to be. If you\u2019re planning a big party, you might want to consider inviting the following people: your immediate family, extended family that live nearby, and people that your mom is close to, like co-workers, friends and neighbors. If you\u2019re planning a more intimate party, maybe stick to just immediate family with a few close friends. Ask your dad or one of your mom\u2019s close friends to help you construct the guest list. Make the guest list a month before the party is scheduled to happen."

          "description":"Once you know how big or small you want the party to be, it\u2019s time to figure out where to hold it. If it\u2019s a smaller party, consider having the party in your own home or in the home of a friend or family member. If it\u2019s a larger party, you may need to rent out space, which will cost money. Look for free spaces in your area. If you belong to a church or synagogue or community center, they may rent out rooms for free for members. Make sure you choose a place where your mom is unlikely to go leading up to the party. If you end up selecting a place that your mom frequents, you will have to find ways to keep her away while setting up the party. This adds an extra layer of complication."

Invitations can be sent out in a number of different ways: you can make or buy physical invitations, invite people online using e-mail or Facebook or call the people you\u2019re inviting directly. Send out invitations roughly four weeks before the date of the party. Make sure to ask people to RSVP by a certain date so you can get an accurate headcount. Remind people that this is a surprise. You don\u2019t want someone accidentally ruining the party. Make a note on the invite for people to park away from the venue. You don\u2019t want a bunch of cars ruining the surprise."

          "description":"The menu for the party will depend on the size of the guest list and the party\u2019s venue. Some venues insist that you use their food and beverages, whereas others will allow you to cater or hire someone else to cater your event. If you are planning a party at home or at a venue that allows outside food, make a list of what you want to cook or order. Consider having a potluck. This will take some of the pressure off you to cater the entire party. Plus, people like being able to contribute something to the event. Plan the menu and order any catering you might need four weeks before the party. Decide if you are going to order a cake or make one on your own. A homemade cake can be more sentimental, but it may take more time. If you're already busy planning a party, ordering a cake may make more sense."

If you want to keep the decorations simple, plan for balloons, streamers and possibly a banner of some kind. If you\u2019re holding the party outside, make sure to decorate with things that won\u2019t get blown around."

          "description":"As the party is for your mother, see if you can think of sentimental decorations. Your mother may appreciate decorations that show her how much you appreciate her as a mother. Photos are a big plus for a party for your mother. Hang up photographs that showcase her role in the family. Go through old photo albums and find pictures from big vacations, milestones, and events in your family's history. If you're tech-savvy, go through old movies and photographs you have on a computer. You can create a short movie to play in the background including photos and videos of your mother. Find decorations that speak to your mom's interests. For example, if your mom is an avid horseback rider, consider having little horse figurines lining the tables and having horse-themed tablecloths."

If your mom asks if something is going on, say something like, \"I don't know what you're talking about.\" Keep playing dumb and your mom's suspicion may pass. Try to distract your mom as you plan party events. If your mom has something else going on, she is less likely to notice you sneaking around. You can, for example, have your dad take your mom out to the movies when you need to start gathering decorations."
