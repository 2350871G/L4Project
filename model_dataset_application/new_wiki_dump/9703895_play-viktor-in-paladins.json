He can do 3,900 damage before he must reload. Right-clicking forces Viktor to look down the barrel of his gun, increasing his accuracy but lowering his movement speed 50%. This will make you deal more damage, since you hit your targets more often."

Viktor throws the grenade, dealing 750 splash damage to enemies in range. His F is called Hustle, and and will let Viktor sprint instead of walking. His movement speed will increase by 65%.
