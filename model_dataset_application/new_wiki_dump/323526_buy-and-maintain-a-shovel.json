Rolled edges that you can push on with your feet are a plus. For heavy or rocky soils, you may wish to get a companion shovel for the above, basically to loosen up the soil so that you can move it with the larger shovel: a thick, heavy blade 8-12\" long by about 4\" wide is well suited for this task. For moving light, granular goods, such as grain, a fairly large and well-scooped shovel is best. For shoveling snow off of driveways, a large shovel with a flat nose is best. The size should be determined by how thick of a layer of snow you are moving: thicker snow means narrower shovel."
