          "description":"Eggplants need warmth, so it is best to start them indoors and transplant them once the weather is warm enough. Aim to germinate the seeds 6-9 weeks before the last frost of the year is predicted. Eggplants should not be re-planted outdoors until the temperature is at least 70 \u00b0F (21 \u00b0C). If you don't wish to plan ahead this way, you can purchase eggplant seedlings directly from a gardening center or nursery.

In 2007 and 2008, Steve taught the Local Sustainable Agriculture Field Practicum at Stanford University. Steve Masley\t\t\tOrganic Vegetable Gardener\t\t\t\tLiving on a hill can affect the date of the last frost. According to the team at Grow it Organically: \"The time of the last frost can vary a little based on the location of your garden. For instance, if your garden is down in the bottom of a hill, the cold air can settle in and you may have a later frost than you would if you were at the top of the hill.\""

Preparing the Planting Location Choose a spot in your garden that gets full sunlight. Eggplants require very high temperatures to grow and thrive in a garden. Ideally, choose a spot that gets sun for more than 6 hours per day to plant your eggplants. If this is not possible, plant eggplants in a spot that get only partial shade.

If the water pools and takes longer than an hour to soak in, your soil is poorly-drained. Fix poorly drained soil by adding an organic soil amendment. Use a gardening rake to loosen the top 8 in (20 cm) of your soil. Pour a 2 in (5.1 cm) layer of organic soil amendment on top of the soil. Use the rake to mix it into the soil evenly. Purchase organic soil amendment materials, such as sand, vermiculite, perlite, or compost,  at a local garden center or hardware store. Planting Eggplant Seedlings Plant seedlings 24\u201330 inches (61\u201376 cm) apart, root-deep. Eggplants do best when they have room to spread and grow. Dig holes slightly larger than your seedlings' roots, spaced 24\u201330 inches (61\u201376 cm) in all directions. Gently place the seedlings in the holes and fill the space around their roots with soil. Place mulch material around the base of your plants. Mulching will help prevent the growth of weeds and keep your plants warm. Straw, compost, and grass clipping are good choices for natural mulch materials. Scatter them around the base of your eggplant seedlings in a thick layer. Be sure to use grass clipping from untreated lawns, as chemicals and fertilizers may harm your plants.

Insert the stakes right away after transplanting your seedlings to avoid disturbing the soil later on. Caring for Eggplant as it Grows Water eggplants thoroughly once a week. To thrive, eggplant need at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water per week. Aim for one weekly, intensive watering rather that multiple, short watering sessions. Frequent watering promotes shallow roots, which can compromise the durability of your eggplants. Remove any flea beetles you find on the leaves of the plants.
