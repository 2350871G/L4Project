          "description":"Slice a 1-layer cake in half with a large bread knife to make 2 thin sheets. Lay plastic wrap in a large mixing bowl to use as a mold, and put one layer of the cake in the bottom of the bowl. Trim off any extra cake around the top until you have a mostly even circle. Add frosting or mousse to the middle of the cake bowl you've just made, then place the other layer of cake on top. Trim off any excess cake sticking over the edge so it all fits in the bowl. Place the cake in the refrigerator to set before turning it out on a plate. You can pour melted chocolate over the dome or smooth frosting on the round part of the dome for decoration."

Fill it with unwrapped candy, such as coated chocolate pieces, gummy bears, fruit candies, or any other candy you like. You can also fill the sunken cake with mousse or lemon curd and put frosting over the top instead. This makes a quick and easy pudding or dessert dish."

Add frosting across the top of the ice cream and around the edges, just as you'd normally frost a cake, to finish the ice cream cake. For a simpler topping, cover the cake in whipped cream and decorate with maraschino cherries."

The base will be less firm though, so don't be surprised if it crumbles on the plate; this solution is best for home use. Another option is to level the cake by slicing off a thin layer at the top to make it smooth. Use a bread knife to cut an even layer across the top."
