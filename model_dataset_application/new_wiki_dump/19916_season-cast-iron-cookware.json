Wad up a paper towel and spread the oil across the cooking surface, any bare iron surfaces, and the bottom of the cookware. Turn on the burner and heat until smoke starts to appear. If using an electric stove, heat slowly as hot spots can crack the cast iron. Cover the cookware and turn heat off. Leave until cooled before placing in storage. Wipe off any excess fat before storing. If your cast iron gets sticky from using oil instead of bacon fat, use it over a campfire to make some bacon or other item which renders pig fat, and the stickiness will burn off."

This allows for any excess oil to drain off to the sides, and prevents pooling during the seasoning process. The higher heating temperatures allow for the oil to truly \"cook\" as opposed to just \"gumming up\" at lower temperatures. Cook undisturbed for 1 hour.

  "text":" Crusty Cast Iron Cookware Place the cookware in a self-cleaning oven. Run one cycle. Alternatively, place in a campfire or directly on a hot charcoal fire for 1/2 hour, and heat until it turns a dull red. The crust will be flaking, falling and turning to white ash. After allowing the cookware to cool a bit (to avoid cracking the cast iron), use the following steps. If you have more rust than crust, try using steel wool to sand it off. Wash the cast iron cookware with warm water and soap. Scrub using a scouring pad. If you have purchased your cast iron cookware as new, then it will be coated in wax or an oily coating to prevent rust. This will need to be removed before seasoning so this step is essential.

Place both the lid and the pot or pan upside down in the oven at a high temperature (300\u00baF to 500\u00baF/150\u00baC-260\u00baC, depending on your preference).

Second Cleaning and Seasoning Method Use the self cleaning oven to strip down the cast iron cookware. Place the utensil in your self cleaning oven on the shortest cleaning cycle (usually 3 hours on most models). It will come out looking like the day it came out of the mold. Allow it to cool overnight. Wash the residue off with water only in the sink, using a stiff abrasive pad.
