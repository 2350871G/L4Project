          "description":"Showing off something you already have is a great way to decorate without spending any money at all. If you have a piece that always makes you smile, like a special heirloom or a painting you love, put it somewhere you spend a lot of time, like your bedroom, kitchen, or living room. As you\u2019re choosing other items for that room, try to think of what will go with the pieces you love the most. For instance, if you hang up a painting in your living room, look for throw pillows or a rug that have some of the same colors as the painting. Get rid of items you don\u2019t love and just display the decor that you really like. Your favorite items will become statement pieces, and you\u2019ll appreciate what you do have more."

          "description":"If there\u2019s a feature in your home that you really like, such as a mantle with interesting molding or a bookshelf where you keep your books, draw attention to it with bright colors. Your eye will automatically be drawn to the brighter shades, making that area really stand out. For instance, you might put a bright glass vase on a shelf to add a pop of color, or you could hang a colorful painting on the wall above your fireplace to show it off. Look through the things you already have to find bright colors, or buy accent pieces on sale or at secondhand stores."

          "headline":"Arrange items in odd-numbered groups.",
          "description":"For some reason, people find odd numbers of items more pleasing to look at than even-numbered groups. As you\u2019re deciding where to place decor around your home, you can elevate the styling by sticking to odd-numbered arrangements. For instance, you might try stacking 5 books together on a shelf, flanked by 2 heavy bookends, or you could use an odd number of picture frames if you create a gallery wall. You could also make a tableau out of different objects, such as a vase, a painting leaned against the wall, and a small bowl filled with pretty rocks. This is a simple trick that you can use to freshen up your decor without buying anything new!"

This small change can make your bedroom feel more luxurious and can pull the room together, and if you find a good deal, it doesn\u2019t have to cost very much money. If you have a sewing machine, you can even make your own sheets! Just buy throw pillows or a throw blanket in a fun new pattern or color if you can\u2019t afford to buy a whole set of bedding at once."

Choose pillows in a color that\u2019s used somewhere else in the room, or find them in a design that goes with the theme of the room. For instance, if your room has a nature theme, you might choose pillows with a design featuring leaves, trees, or birds. You can even recover your old throw pillows to give them a new look. Buying pillow covers is cheaper and can change the look of items simply and inexpensively."

Just sew a pocket into the top of a long strip of fabric, hem the other end, and run a curtain rod through the pocket. You can also make your own shower curtain to freshen up your bathroom! Just make sure you use a waterproof shower curtain liner so the fabric doesn\u2019t get water-stained. Shower curtains and sheets can be fashioned into curtains as well. If you find a pattern or color you love, don't hesitate to use these for drapery."

However, if you\u2019re afraid you don\u2019t have a green thumb, you can fill a vase or a bowl with fresh flowers or fruit, and change it whenever they start to turn brown. You can even use artificial plants or flowers, but remember to dust them regularly!"

Then, frame photos of your loved ones, pressed flowers, old calendar pages, or even pictures you print out from online! Group several frames together to create your very own gallery wall. If you have small keepsakes you\u2019d like to display, place them in a shadow box and hang them on your wall."

Try to imagine how you could re-use each piece, and you might be surprised what you can come up with! Sometimes just moving a big piece of furniture, like your couch or your bed, can give you a whole new perspective on a room!

Take everything out of the room that you can and cover the floor with a drop cloth. Then, cover the wall in 1-2 coats of primer, let those dry, and go back over the walls with your chosen paint color. Light colors will make a room look larger, so avoid very dark colors in a small room. Cool colors like blue and green are relaxing, so they\u2019re a great choice for bedrooms. Warm colors are very inviting, so they\u2019re great for living areas and kitchens. You can even get creative by painting one wall a different color or by adding stripes, chevrons, or chalkboard paint to your walls. If you love the look of wallpaper but don\u2019t have room in your budget, use a stencil to paint a pattern on your walls instead!

If you can find a good deal on a new light fixture, changing it yourself is usually pretty easy. Just turn off the power to the room at your circuit breaker, remove the old light fixture, and rewire the new one. Take care to match up the negative and positive wires, then attach the new fixture to the ceiling with the provided brackets and screws. Don\u2019t feel that you necessarily have to buy new light fixtures. Sometimes, all it takes it a good cleaning or a coat of spray paint to bring new life to the light fixtures you already have. Adding a new shade or cover is inexpensive and can quickly update the look of older fixtures. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable working with wiring yourself, it might be worth it to save up and have an electrician do the job. Tip: If you have a lot of lamps, try updating your lamp shades!"

Luckily, you can give it new life by covering the back walls with colorful contact paper, wallpaper scraps, or even fabric. This will brighten up the bookcase and will provide a nice contrast to show off whatever you\u2019re displaying on the shelves. You can also paint your bookcase, if you\u2019d like.

Try installing it around your ceiling or floors, on your cabinets, or around your windows to create an upscale look on a budget. You can even find stick-on molding, making this project easy and cheap! To mimic the look of moldings, add trim 6 inches above your floor trim and paint the gap to match the trim. This will give you the look of architectural trim for less than half of the usual price."

Instead, look for sales on area rugs that match your theme or color palette for each room. If buying a new rug is too expensive, visit a flooring store and ask if they have vinyl remnants. These are pieces of vinyl left over from previous projects that are too small to re-use, but are often large enough to use as an area rug. To personalize the look even more, paint a design on the remnant with acrylic paints and seal with concrete sealer."

Mirrors help create an optical illusion that a space is larger than it really is, so wall mirrors are a great touch in smaller rooms or narrow hallways. In addition, the mirrors will reflect any light that\u2019s in the room, making it look brighter. If you like the shape of a mirror but not the frame, try painting it! If you have an unframed mirror in your bathroom and can\u2019t afford a new one, you can frame your mirror in by attaching moldings around all four sides."

Just turn off the power to the room at your circuit breaker, remove the old light fixture, and rewire the new one. Take care to match up the negative and positive wires, then attach the new fixture to the ceiling with the provided brackets and screws. Don\u2019t feel that you necessarily have to buy new light fixtures. Sometimes, all it takes it a good cleaning or a coat of spray paint to bring new life to the light fixtures you already have. Adding a new shade or cover is inexpensive and can quickly update the look of older fixtures. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable working with wiring yourself, it might be worth it to save up and have an electrician do the job. Tip: If you have a lot of lamps, try updating your lamp shades! Cover the back of a bookcase with contact paper to give it a new look. Bookcases provide a lot of practical storage, so even if you\u2019re not in love with yours, it might be best to keep it. Luckily, you can give it new life by covering the back walls with colorful contact paper, wallpaper scraps, or even fabric. This will brighten up the bookcase and will provide a nice contrast to show off whatever you\u2019re displaying on the shelves. You can also paint your bookcase, if you\u2019d like. Paint it a different color from the walls to make it stand out, or paint it the same color if you want it to look like it\u2019s a part of the wall. Add architectural trim to your walls. Architectural trim, also called molding or decorative trim, can make a room look expensive, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily cost a lot. Try installing it around your ceiling or floors, on your cabinets, or around your windows to create an upscale look on a budget. You can even find stick-on molding, making this project easy and cheap! To mimic the look of moldings, add trim 6 inches above your floor trim and paint the gap to match the trim. This will give you the look of architectural trim for less than half of the usual price. Add rugs to bring warmth to a room. Carpeting and rugs create a cozy, warm feeling, but replacing your carpet can be very expensive. Instead, look for sales on area rugs that match your theme or color palette for each room. If buying a new rug is too expensive, visit a flooring store and ask if they have vinyl remnants. These are pieces of vinyl left over from previous projects that are too small to re-use, but are often large enough to use as an area rug. To personalize the look even more, paint a design on the remnant with acrylic paints and seal with concrete sealer. Hang mirrors to make a room feel larger. Look for large mirrors at secondhand shops and home improvement stores, then install them wherever you need more space. Mirrors help create an optical illusion that a space is larger than it really is, so wall mirrors are a great touch in smaller rooms or narrow hallways. In addition, the mirrors will reflect any light that\u2019s in the room, making it look brighter. If you like the shape of a mirror but not the frame, try painting it! If you have an unframed mirror in your bathroom and can\u2019t afford a new one, you can frame your mirror in by attaching moldings around all four sides.",
