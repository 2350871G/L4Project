There should be enough oil to cover the entire bottom of your pan. If there isn't, add more oil. Avoid pan-frying the steaks in olive oil or butter. These will burn over the high heat."

Lift the steaks up and shake off the excess flour mixture. Wash your hands with soap and water after handling the raw steaks to prevent the spread of disease. It's a good idea to handle the steaks with one hand while using your other hand to sprinkle the flour mixture over the steak. This keeps one hand dry so the flour mixture doesn't stick to you."

          "description":"Once the oil is hot and shimmering, carefully lower the prepared steaks into the pan. Cook the steaks for 3 minutes on medium-high heat. Use tongs to flip the steaks over and cook for another 3 minutes. The steaks should be golden brown. If they're thin, they should be finished cooking. If they're thick, transfer them to the oven to finish cooking for another 6 to 10 minutes. Regardless of thickness, the pork loin steaks should be at least 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C) before they're ready to serve. If you're finishing the steaks in the oven, ensure that the pan you use is oven safe."

If your steaks are more than 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm) thick, consider broiling them 4 to 5 in (10 to 13 cm) away from the heat source.
