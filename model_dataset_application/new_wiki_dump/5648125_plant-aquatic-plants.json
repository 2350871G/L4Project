While sandy soil may keep the plant anchored, it will not hold enough nutrients to keep aquatic plants healthy. Do not use potting soil that is formulated for regular, terrestrial potted plants.

Then, put two to four aquatic plant fertilizer tablets on the soil spaced evenly around the container 2 to 3 inches in from the edge. The number of tablets required varies, depending on the size of the tablets and the size of the container. There should be 1 to 2 ounces of fertilizer for each gallon of soil.

Place additional damp soil into the container over the rhizome. The higher end should be just above soil level and the lower end should be covered. If you're growing tropical water lily and lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) rhizomes, center them in the pot. Their \u201ceyes\u201d should be facing up and the top of the rhizome should be above soil level. Lotuses grow well in Zones 4 to 10. If you're growing Cannas, plant them in the center of the container. Then, cover them with 2 to 3 inches of soil. For other types of aquatic plants with roots instead of rhizomes, fill the container with \u2154 to \u00be damp soil. Then, hold the plant in the center of the container and add more damp soil until the roots are covered. Add \u00bd to \u00be inch of pea gravel over the top of the soil for all aquatic plants. This will help to keep the soil in the container and keep fish from displacing the soil. Water the aquatic plant right after planting. The soil should be wet. Part 4: Planting Aquatic Plants in Water Plant the aquatic plants in the spring or early summer in a water feature that gets at least six hours of sunlight each day. Aquatic plants that get only four hours of sunlight or less will grow very slowly or may not grow at all. Plant aquatic plants hardy enough to survive cooler temperatures in water that is 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C). Aquatic plants such as hardy water lilies and lotus do well in these conditions. Plant tropical and subtropical aquatics in water that is over 70 \u00b0F (21 \u00b0C). Cannas and tropical water lilies will do well in these conditions. Place them in a spot where there is no more than 6 to 8 inches of water above the pot. This will then allow sunlight to easily reach them. Bricks or overturned clay pots can be placed beneath the aquatic plant container to raise it up if the water is too deep. Deeper water will not let the sunlight reach the plant rhizomes or roots to trigger new stem growth. Hardy water lilies grow best with 1 to 1 \u00bd feet of water covering the container. Tropical water lilies do fine with 6 to 12 inches of water over the container but lotus grow in 4 to 6 inches of water. Cannas grow well up above the water. They should be placed so that the top of the container is 6 to 8 inches deep. If the pond gets only six hours of sunlight each day, place them at a depth of 6 inches. Adjust this to 6 to 8 inches if the pond gets more than six hours of sunlight. Lotus should be submerged to a depth of only 2 inches until they begin to grow. After the aquatic plants reach 4 to 6 inches tall, they can be moved into deeper water. Do not lift the plant by its stems. They will break. Instead, lift the container by grasping it at the top with one hand on either side to hold it level or grasp it at the top on one side, tilt it just enough to get a hand underneath and move it with one hand on the bottom and one hand at the top of the container. Keep the container as level as possible when moving it. This will keep the gravel from spilling over the side of the container.",
