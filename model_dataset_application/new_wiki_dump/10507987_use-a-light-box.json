          "description":"The intensity is measured in lux, with the most commonly used box being 10,000 lux. Buy one that has a built-in UV filter, which will protect your skin and eyes from any harmful rays. Be sure you\u2019re buying a light box specifically for managing symptoms of depression. There are other boxes that are for skin conditions. You can buy a light box from most department stores or an online retailer. They start around $40 but models with higher light intensity or better quality bulbs can cost several hundred dollars. How to Choose a Light Box\nIf you want to spend less time under the lamp, pick a higher intensity light box between 5,000 and 10,000 lux. Lower intensity boxes, starting as low as 2,500 lux, require more time to get the same effect. If you don\u2019t want to damage your eyes, look for a box with white light instead of blue light. If you want to take your box on the go, buy a portable version or one with a smaller screen."

A bar-height table or counter are both good spots to put your light box. Read the package or instructions to find out how far away from you the box should be positioned. It will vary based on brand or intensity."

Adjust the box so it\u2019s angled down towards your face, but a little to the left or right so it\u2019s not shining straight into your eyes. Keep your eyes open when you use the box. If you sleep or close your eyes, you won\u2019t get the same effect. Never stare directly into the light box when it\u2019s turned on or you could damage your eyes."

Turn on the lamp soon after waking for the best results and sit in a comfortable chair facing the box. You can multitask while you\u2019re sitting under the light. Choose sedentary activities like reading, writing, or using a laptop. You should start noticing an improvement in your mood or energy after about 1 week. Always use the box as early in the day as possible. If you use it at night within 3 hours of bed, the light may disrupt your sleep."

You can split up your light box use into 2 30-minute sessions to fit your schedule if you\u2019d like, keeping both early in the day. If you increase the time and still don\u2019t notice any improvement, or if your symptoms worsen, talk to your doctor about other options. There are no reported serious side effects to using a light box for longer. However, if your eyes begin to feel strained or if you get a headache, try sitting farther from the light or using it for less time."

Start using the light box when you first notice symptoms, and then stop using it in the spring when your depression subsides. You can also start using the light box earlier, like in September, as a preventative measure if you\u2019d like. If you have general depression or bipolar disorder, you can sit under a light box year round."
