Is your email program nearly full, or do you use more than one email account because of all the storage you need? Do you have multiple duplicates of photos, and is it hard to find a photo you need? Is your hard drive 75 percent full or more? Do you have multiple accounts for similar things, making it hard to find stuff? Are any of your digital file systems overwhelming? Do you have email from 5 years ago? Do you have project files from 2 years ago?

      "description":"In the beginning, you\u2019ll need to devote some time to purging files. Thirty minutes a day is a good time \u2014 put it in your calendar, and just spend 30 minutes purging everything you can. See the \"Tips\" below for more details. When you\u2019re done with your massive purge, it feels amazing! It\u2019s worth the time you spend doing it. Target one folder at a time. If you can set aside some time each day for purging, then each day you should target a large folder. Start with the biggest ones and then work your way down. \"Folders\" mean anything that contains digital files or information, email accounts, Flickr accounts, hard drives, USB flash drives, Internet bookmarks, My Documents sub-folders, etc. Choose only the important stuff, and trash the rest. Go through all the stuff in the folder you\u2019re targeting (see above) and pick out only the most important stuff, only the super essential files. Put them in a separate, temporary folder. Once you\u2019ve picked out the essential stuff, delete the rest. Put the essential stuff back where it belongs and delete the temporary folder. What this leaves you with is a lot less stuff in each folder \u2014 just the stuff you need. Sometimes, you can delete an entire folder \u2014 if you can, then do so."

But it\u2019s much better to reduce your stuff, and to get it as simple as possible, before organizing it all. If you simplify enough, you might not even need to organize at all!

For example, you could organize all the information in your life in a personal wiki, creating different pages in the wiki for different types of info. Having one place for everything reduces the need to look for stuff."

In Gmail, for example, you could create a filter that searched for all your email messages older than 6 months. Scan through this new folder, and delete all of the messages if possible. You could then do a second filter to find all types of media files (.jpg, .gif, .pdf, .mov, .mp3, .mpg, etc.) and then delete as many of these as possible."

Instead, use a simple filing system where you have a folder for downloads, another for things you're currently working on, another for read/review, and another for archives. For shortcuts to applications, use a program like AutoHotKey to make keyboard shortcuts to all the applications you use \u2014 much faster than shortcuts on the desktop."
