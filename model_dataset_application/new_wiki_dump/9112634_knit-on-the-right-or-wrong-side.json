By inspecting the work, you can identify which is the right side and which side is the wrong side. For example, when working stockinette stitch (alternating between knitting and purling), then right side is the knit stitches and the wrong side is the purl stitches. Knit stitches lay flat and look similar to braids. Purl stitches are bumpy and look wavy or curvy. Some stitches will produce the same results on both sides of the work, so it is harder to identify the right side and wrong side. For example, garter stitch (knit all stitches on both sides) looks the same on both sides."
