Set your oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit (150 degrees Celsius) and bake the sand for 45 minutes to sanitize it. Beach sand is home to lots of microscopic lifeforms. If you're making something that will be handled a lot, like kinetic sand, it's a good idea to sanitize the beach sand. If you want to use beach sand for a hermit crab habitat, you should bake it to sterilize it so your hermit crab isn't exposed to fungus or bacteria."

Simmer for a few minutes to dissolve the salt, then remove the pan from heat and use a large coffee filter to collect the sand. Try attaching a coffee filter to a large wide-mouth jar with a rubber band. The coffee filter will strain the sand from the saltwater. Be careful handling the hot pot, and let the water cool until it's safe to touch. If you want to mix sand with paint, you should remove salt from the sand first to avoid corroding the canvas or paper over time."
