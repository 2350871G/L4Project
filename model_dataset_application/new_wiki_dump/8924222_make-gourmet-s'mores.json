Buy one of these flavored graham crackers to use as a base for your s'mores:\nCinnamon\nChocolate\nVanilla\nChocolate chip"

Just twist apart the cookie and sandwich the toasted marshmallow and any fillings between the cookie lids. You can also use thin waffle cookies for a slightly caramelized flavor. If you'd like a similar flavor to graham crackers, try using digestive biscuits/cookies."

Consider using:\nChocolate chip cookies\nPeanut butter cookies\nGingersnaps\nOatmeal raisin cookies"

You can still top it with a marshmallow. Or if you enjoy the flavor of citrus and chocolate, just spread the fruit curd on the cracker underneath the chocolate bar. For example, spread lemon curd on a graham cracker. Top it with a toasted marshmallow for a s'more that tastes like lemon meringue pie."

Just spread a layer of your favorite nut butter over the cookie or cracker base. Try almond, hazelnut, or peanut butter. Nut butters also taste great when you pair them with fruit (like bananas)."
