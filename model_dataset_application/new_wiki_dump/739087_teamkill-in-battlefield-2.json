      "description":"Best kit for aircraft T-King is anti-tank. Generally, one AT missile will destroy a waiting aircraft. If you can, destroy the aircraft when your teammate is running towards it, but not close enough to be killed by the explosion, so you won't get as many negative points. The annoyance factor to him is, of course, the same, perhaps better if he can see that Su-34 blow up before his eyes."
