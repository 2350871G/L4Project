Some babies want a comfort item or stuffed animal while other babies don't pay them much attention. Just let your baby decide what they want. They may end up choosing a different stuffed animal or might wait a few months before becoming attached to one. Some babies that self-soothe might not want a comfort item or stuffed animal. These babies may prefer rubbing their hands through their hair or sucking a thumb or pacifier. Make sure that other parents and caregivers are on the same page. If your child goes to daycare, make sure that the daycare will provide the stuffed animal for your baby as consistently as you do."

You should also avoid letting them sleep with any soft loveys, blankets, or bumpers, since these could increase the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), suffocation, or strangulation. Don't forget to remove any pillows or soft crib bumpers as well. Wait to introduce pillows until your baby is at least 2 years old."
