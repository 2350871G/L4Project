It is a good time to create teams BEFORE the party instead of letting the girls do it themselves. That way they won\u2019t argue over who is on whose team and no feelings will get hurt. But, when the party starts you can let the girls decide what they want their team name to be, for example, Team Pink."

      "description":"When they arrive at the party, give each team a tote bag that contains a notepad, a pen or pencil, a plastic bag, a map of the mall the party is at, the list of tasks/riddles, and a digital camera. If you do not have enough digital cameras for each of the teams to have one camera, you could ask the girls to bring their own (If they have one). Or, the guests could just use their cell phones to take pictures and video."

Also, make sure the guest\u2019s parents are okay with this as well. If you or the guest\u2019s parents are not comfortable with this, you can assign an adult chaperone to every group. This all depends on how old the guests are."

      "description":"You may want to send out Evites through Email instead of your daughter passing them out at school. That way no one will be upset if they didn\u2019t get invited. Also, you could mail the invites to the guest\u2019s houses or go to their houses and drop them off at the front door. There are also plenty of websites where you can print out invitations especially made for mall scavenger hunts. They are super cute and they are made to look just like credit cards!"

      "description":"Let the guests ask any questions they might have. Since your local mall is probably pretty big, before the scavenger hunt starts; tell the groups what time the scavenger hunt ends and where to meet up with the other groups. That way, the kids can come find YOU instead of searching the mall for all the groups. For Example, \u201cThe Scavenger hunt ends at 6:00 pm. At 6:00 pm, meet the other groups at the food court for dinner.\u201d If the group gets there late, subtract 30 points from their total score. Also tell the kids who to call if they have a problem. Make sure the rules are all clear. If the groups do not have adult chaperones, you might want to wander around the mall and try to check in with the groups throughout the party to make sure everything is going smoothly."
