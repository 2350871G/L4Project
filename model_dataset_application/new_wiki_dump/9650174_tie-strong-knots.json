Pull the working end around the straight line of the rope, then back through the loop going the other direction. Pull tightly to secure. This is a great knot if you need to secure something to a post--simply loop the knot over the top. You can also use the Bowline as a handle or step in an emergency situation, if you need to rescue someone who\u2019s fallen. Make it about a hand-span across to create an easy grasp.

Take the ends again and cross them in the opposite direction, pulling right under left. A simple, secure tie, this knot is perfect for tying 2 ropes together for a longer line, or tying up both ends of a single rope to secure a bundle."

Take the large, nearby loop and pass it down through the small circle. Repeat using the other end of the rope, again making sure that the end of the rope is passed over the standing section. Pull the other loop down through this circle. Pull the knot from either side to tighten. This knot will only hold tight with a constant tension from either side. If the rope will be stretched back and forth, on and off, tape down the 2 loops to keep the knot secure."

Then, wrap the rope twice around the line between each pole, going back towards the pole you started with. Finish by tying the loose end of the rope to the end of the original Clove Hitch. You can spread the legs of this tripod and use it for different purposes around your camp. The Tripod Lashing is often used for making shelters."

Take the length of the rope and tie it around both poles 5-6 times, passing under the bottom pole and over the top pole on both sides. Then, wrap the rope between the poles and around these lines 2-3 times. Use a Square Knot to tie the free end of the rope to the end of the original Clove Hitch Knot. This knot is great for building larger shelters, making camp chairs or bridges, or simply securing 2 poles together."

Pinch it with your left hand and repeat the wrapping process on the other side. Wrap the left line over the right 3-4 times, in the opposite direction as your first wrapping. Pull the working end back towards the original junction, pulling it back through the loop. Spit on the loop to lubricate, then tighten by gently pulling the standing lines.
