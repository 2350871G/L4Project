          "description":"Tell your parents you\u2019d like to host a party at your house. Let them know if there\u2019s a specific reason you\u2019re throwing the party, such as a friend\u2019s birthday or a year-end celebration. Listen to their comments or concerns, and answer any questions they may have. Your parents will most likely want to be home while you have guests over and will check in on how everything is going. Let them know who you want to invite and what activities you plan on doing. The more informed they are, the more likely they\u2019ll say yes. Discuss rooms that would be on and off limits. Rooms like the kitchen, family room, basement, or backyard work best for a party, but don\u2019t let guests in any of the bedrooms. Talk to your parents about setting a budget and if they can help with any of the expenses, like decorations and food."

Provide blankets if you can and tell your guests to bring pillows, a toothbrush, and a change of clothes. Only have a sleepover if you are having an all boy or all girl party. Turn your sleepover into a camp-out in your yard if you have tents large enough for your guests. Ask your guests to bring a sleeping bag and a pillow so they can stay comfortable."

A theme can help pull a party together and make it memorable for your guests. For example, if it's a birthday party, decorate with the birthday guest's favorite colors or choose a theme based on something they love, like baseball or ballet."

Don\u2019t invite anyone who you know wrecks parties or would be a bad influence on others. Let your parents know who you plan to invite to see if they have concerns. If you\u2019re inviting groups of people that have never met, think about their interests to see if they would get along. You can invite all girls, all boys, or a mix of both if your parents are okay with it. If you decide to do a mixed-gender party, try to invite an equal number of boys and girls so no one feels alone."

Set a specific timeframe for your party so people know when to arrive and when they should arrange to have their parents pick them up. Be courteous and mindful of your friends\u2019 curfews. Don\u2019t throw a party late into the night when they have to be home by 10 PM. Talk to the friends you\u2019re inviting ahead of time to see if they have any important events on their schedule. Try to plan around the events if possible. In reality, not everyone is going to make it to your party. Be understanding about what your friends have going on in their lives."

Ask your friends to RSVP a week before you hold the party so you know how many guests to plan for. You can make a private event on Facebook and invite the friends you want. This allows you and your friends to have a group chat without worrying about others RSVPing or getting upset. Hand out your invitations discreetly so other friends you couldn\u2019t invite don\u2019t get hurt feelings."
