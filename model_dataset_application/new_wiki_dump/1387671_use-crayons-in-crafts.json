Wait about 30 minutes. Remove the candle from the mold. If you are using a muffin tin, turn it upside-down and tap the bottom gently. Make a collage: With Glue Have a platform. Get a stiff piece of paper or card, canvas-board or thin sheet of wood, that your collage will be glued on. This is your base. Draw an outline of shapes on your base. You can draw a picture, some shapes, or download pre-drawn stencils from the Internet, to act as a guide. Stick crayons to your base, using your outline as a guide. Apply a thick layer of glue to fill up the outline, then press the crayons lengthwise into the glue. You can use whole crayons or broken pieces, or you can use crayon shavings. Add decorations if you like. You can also glue buttons, crumpled balls of coloured tissue paper, glitter, feathers, and ribbons to your base or as a border. Leave to dry for a few hours. Thick layers of glue will need more time to dry. Make a temporary collage Arrange the crayons and make a picture. This is similar to making a collage, but instead of using glue. Take a photo of the arrangement you made.  Print your photo, and use the crayons in another arrangement or craft project.  Make a colourful pen-holder or vase Get a plain pen-holder or make one from a clean empty jar or sturdy paper cup.  Glue crayons vertically around the base of the pen-holder. It's easier if you leave the crayon wrappers on. Squeeze a thick bead of glue along the length of the crayon, and press the glued part onto the side of the pen-holder. Add more decorations if you like. Tie some ribbon around the pen-holder and glue it in place, add stickers, or write a person's name with a marker if giving as a gift. Leave to dry.  Make a Crayon Bouquet Measure about three inches from the end of a piece of floral wire. You can buy pre-cut lengths. Wrap the measured section of the wire in a spiral around the base of the crayon.  Cut a piece of Oasis or block of Styrofoam (maybe from packaging) to fit a vase, basket or container that you want to have your bouquet in. Put it into the container. Stick the straight end of your wire-wrapped crayon into the Oasis.  Measure another piece of wire and wrap another crayon. Repeat until you have wrapped all the crayons you want to put in your bouquet. Arrange all the crayons: stick the wired crayons into the Oasis to make your desired arrangement, the way you might arrange flowers.  Make Christmas decorations or party favours Use new crayons. (You're giving these as gifts or favours.) Decide which colours you will use. Choose colours to match the occasion. If it's for Christmas, use red, green and white crayons. For a birthday, use different or random colours. For Valentine's day, use red, pink and white. Buy enough crayons that each person can have at least three. 3,4 or 5 crayons per person is good, but you can add more. Take a piece of play-doh or non-hardening modeling clay and roll it into a thin sausage.  Wrap the play-doh around the crayon, about halfway along the crayon's length. Press 2 or 3 other crayons alongside the first. Tie a length of ribbon around the bundle of crayons and make a bow. Use one loop of the bow to hang the bundle from a hook or a from a branch of your Christmas tree, until you're ready to give it as a favour.",
