Square pillows (or cushions) provide the best shape but the shape is determined by the final look you're after, as even a rectangular pillow can work. If repurposing an old pillow, clean it well to remove marks. Measure the pillow. For the sake of this tutorial, the assumption is that the pillow you're using is square. Any other shape and you'll need to make adjustments as befits the shape. Using the measurements, create a triangle paper template that will reach from corner to corner of the \"top\" of the pillow and meet evenly in the center of the \"base of the pillow.  Cut out the triangle paper. Pin this carefully to the pillow front, the tip going down to the base and the two top edges meeting the top edges of the pillow. The pins must create a very tight line down the edges of the triangle, to ensure exact lines when painting the fabric paint in place. Prepare the black fabric paint. Pour into a container for ease of access and have your brush ready. Begin by carefully painting a line down each side of the triangle you've just stuck to the pillow front. This creates the neat barrier lines between the tuxedo coat and the white shirt that will be underneath it. It might help to follow a ruler for exactness. Paint the exposed portions of the pillow black. This will be the two triangle shapes to each side of the paper triangle. Allow to dry completely before removing the template. Remove the paper pattern. You should have a cushion with two black triangle sides and a big white triangle center. Make the bow tie pattern. You'll need two evenly shaped triangles for this.
