  "text":" Create Your Design Consider the size and shape of the wreath. Looking to cover a front door or decorating an outdoor space? Knowing the size and scope of your project will help you determine the supplies you need. Determine if you should decorate with colorful clay pots or traditional terracotta pots. The room and type of design should play a part in whether you use decorative or traditional pots. Assess the type of wreath you\u2019d like to use. From branch thatched to traditional woven, you should also consider the wreath color. Regardless of color and design, only select an extremely sturdy wreath that can support your clay pot collection. Purchase Supplies Select your wreath. If you have taken any measurements, keep those in mind when selecting a wreath. Choose pots. Keep in mind the size of the room and the wreath when selecting the pots (smaller pots may work better with a smaller wreath). Buy extra adornments and decorations for the wreath. This includes ribbon, moss or toys (for a holiday like July 4th). Purchase adhesive items such as twine and a hot glue gun (or glue pellets if you already own a hot glue gun).  Create Wreath Lay wreath and supplies on a flat surface covered with either a drop cloth or newspaper. Protect surfaces from sticky hot glue or work in an area that can be exposed to hot glue. Position clay pots around the top of the wreath. Without tying or gluing into place, position the pots around the wreath until you like the design. Tie pots into place with the twine. Thread the twine through the pre-drilled hole at the bottom of each pot and tie to the wreath, knotting the twine behind the wreath. Add hot glue underneath each tied pot for added security. Simply slide the hot glue nozzle underneath the pot and add a few drops of glue. Hold in place until dry. Decorate with added items using your hot glue gun. If items you chose are heavy you may want to tie them into place with twine too. Finished. ",
