          "description":"In most cases, the first indication that your underground pipes are leaking will come from your water or sewer bill. If you see a massive price spike from one month to the next, or if your bill increases each month despite your water usage staying the same, you may be dealing with a leaky pipe."

          "description":"Some water bill spikes are caused by leaky appliances, especially toilets, so check them first. To check for a toilet leak, add some food coloring to the tank and let it sit for 10 minutes. If the coloring moved to the bowl, you have a toilet leak. For a faucet or water-based appliance, look for pooling or dripping water around the appliance itself or the connected pipes."

          "description":"Slab leaks create water build-ups underneath your concrete foundation. To escape, this water may pool on top of your floors, yard, or the concrete itself. If you have carpeted floors, search for areas that look darker or are unexpectedly damp. If you have wood panel floors, watch out for spots where the wood starts to warp."

          "description":"When water sits for a long time, it creates a perfect environment for mold and mildew to grow. Though you most likely won\u2019t be able to see it, be aware of areas in your house that smell musty of funky for a long period of time. Mold and mildew are most likely to grow under carpet or, if the water leak spreads, behind drywall."

          "description":"High water pressure is what lets sinks, bathtubs, and showers provide you with plenty of water for your everyday needs. If they suddenly become less powerful, providing smaller or weaker streams, a leaky pipe may be to blame. To check if your fixtures are less powerful, turn off every water-based appliance in the house and test the stream from a single faucet."

Because hot water is constantly escaping, your heater is working overtime to warm up the new water. If there are no other signs of a slab leak, look for indications that the water heater itself is broken, such as muddy water or loud cracks coming from the tank."

If you find one, mark the area with masking tape. If the spot stays hot for over 24 hours, it might be over a broken hot water pipe. If you own a cat, check any areas where it likes to sleep. Cats look for warm spots to curl up on, and their favorite spot may be directly over a hot water leak."

When these pipes break, water escapes to the surface and causes the foundation to crack or warp. Common indications of sewer leaks include:\nCracks in your floor, tiles, bricks, or moldings. Rotated, bowed, or separated walls. Uneven or warped floors. Doors or windows that won\u2019t close or have separated from the house."
