  "text":" Preparation Grease bottom and sides of the 13x9 baking pan with butter and set aside.  Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Place a pan of water on the bottom rack. (This step allows for even baking when the baklava is placed in the oven) Prepare the Filling Finely chop the walnuts and place in a large mixing bowl, and add cinnamon, and sugar.  Mix well.  Set aside.  Assemble the Pastry Remove the phyllo dough from the packaging and open then dough up and immediately cover with a damp towel after removing the first full sheet.  Cut the remaining phyllo sheets into the 13x9 sheets. Measure your pan and cut the sheet to match the size of the inside dimensions. Carefully lay the full sheet into the greased pan, folding the edges over.  Generously apply the melted butter using a pastry brush to phyllo dough.  Lay a cut sheet of phyllo dough in the bottom of the pan and again liberally apply the melted butter.  Repeat 9 more times and apply melted butter between each sheet, until you have 10 small sheets of phyllo dough and 1 full sheet as your bottom layer.  Sprinkle approximately 2 cups of walnut mixture into the pan.  Lay 6 more sheets of phyllo dough, on top of the walnut mixture and again apply melted butter between each sheet.  Repeat steps 7 and 8 3 more times, so that you have 4 separate layers of the walnut mixture.  For the top layer, place the remaining phyllo sheets, making sure to generously apply melted butter in between each sheet.  Using a sharp spatula, carefully fold over the large sheet of phyllo that should be extended over the edge, back on top, so you can see down the inside edges of the pan.
