Remember that there are a number of fluids in your engine that could feasibly leak, so check closely to confirm if the puddle you find is coolant, oil, or possibly even just water from running the air conditioner. Touch the puddle with your finger, then wipe it on a white sheet of paper to see what color it really is. If it is green or orange, it\u2019s likely a coolant leak."

Most coolant reservoirs have \u201cfill lines\u201d labeled on the container that will let you know if the coolant levels are low in your vehicle. Check the coolant level in your vehicle and top it off with a water/coolant mixture if it appears to be low. Check it again after a few days to see if the level has changed. Make sure to check the coolant levels with the vehicle at about the same temperature each time (either warm from driving or cool from sitting). Dropping coolant levels in conjunction with puddles means a coolant leak is very likely. Check in the owner's or service manual for your vehicle to locate the coolant reservoir if you are unsure of where to find it."

Keep your eye on the temperature gauge in your vehicle. If it begins to run consistently warmer, or begins to overheat sporadically, there is an issue with your cooling system. Failing to adequately cool your engine could mean your coolant levels are too low. Coolant can eventually go bad. If the coolant levels are still high but the engine is overheating, one issue may be that the coolant needs to be replaced. If you are uncertain of what the symbols on your gauges mean, refer to your vehicle's owner's manual to determine which is the temperature gauge."

Then start your engine and visually inspect the engine bay, looking closely for signs of a leak. Coolant is usually under pressure, so a leak could spray out or it may only trickle. Wear safety glasses and exercise caution while looking around the engine bay with the engine running. Do not put your hands inside the engine bay with the engine running. Look for any new signs of coolant leaks then follow the coolant to the highest point to locate the crack or hole."

Allow the car to sit for a few hours to make sure it\u2019s completely cool before coming into contact with any parts of the coolant system. After a few hours, lightly tap the top of the radiator to see if it is cool to the touch. If it\u2019s warm, the coolant inside may still be quite hot.

Locate the designated jack points for your vehicle by consulting your owner\u2019s manual to avoid doing any damage to the vehicle while you jack it up. Once the vehicle is high enough to slide your container underneath it, place jack stands beneath it to support the weight of the vehicle. Never work under a vehicle that is supported only by a jack. Jack stands will prevent the jack from losing pressure and lowering the vehicle while you\u2019re beneath it."

Once you have located it, make sure the container is positioned properly beneath it and open the valve. The coolant should be cool coming out of the radiator, but you should still take care to avoid letting it come into contact with your bare skin.

You should repeat this process two or three times. If you only allow the engine to run for a few minutes each time, it should not get too warm to drain the radiator.

Fill the reservoir until it is an inch above the \u201cfull\u201d line, then start the engine. As it warms up, the thermostat will open, allowing coolant to flow in. As the coolant level drops in the reservoir, continue to add to it. Add the mixture to the radiator or reservoir until you reach the maximum suggested capacity. If you do not have your owner\u2019s manual, check the vehicle manufacturer\u2019s website for fluid capacities. It may take a few minutes for the coolant to drain into the system, so be patient as your pour the new coolant in.
