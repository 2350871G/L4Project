          "description":"To start, use a credit card, utility knife, ruler, or plastic scraper to gently peel away large chunks of paper and glue that have been left on the surface. Hold the scraper at a 45-degree angle to the surface as you work. As you scrape and peel, stop intermittently to clean the edge of the scraper. Be careful using a sharp scraper since it could leave scratches on your surface."

Press the tape firmly against the adhesive, and then quickly pull your fingers away to rip the tape off. Repeat with different sections of the tape to remove as much leftover residue as possible. Skip this step if you are trying to remove adhesive from a delicate surface like paper or books."

An oil-based product will help lubricate the surface of the adhesive and work to remove it, an alcohol-based product will dry out the adhesive, and a solvent will work to dissolve the glue. Alcohol and Goo Gone have had the most success removing adhesive residues, but if you try one product and it doesn\u2019t work, don\u2019t be afraid to try another. Other popular products include:\nCleaning products, such as Windex, Mr. Clean Magic Eraser, furniture polish, vinegar, or PVC pipe cleaner\nBeauty products, such as nail polish remover, toothpaste, hand lotion, hair spray, mineral oil, perfume, non-acetone nail polish, and aftershave\nOil-based foods, such as margarine, cooking spray, peanut butter, and mayonnaise\nEucalyptus oil, tea tree oil, and vegetable oil\nHousehold products such as kerosene, paint thinner, petroleum jelly, and lighter fluid\nFor paper products, books, or walls, you will need a pencil or art gum eraser"
