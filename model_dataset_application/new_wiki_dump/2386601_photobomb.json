Look for photobomb opportunities at parties, tourist destinations, or other crowded events with a lot of camera holders. Avoid photobombing a professional photographer\u2019s photos, especially at a wedding or other event for which people pay for and care strongly about the quality of the photos."

          "description":"Move closer to the cameraperson and the subjects of the photo about to take place so that you are in the right position to insert yourself at the right time. Be sure to remain unnoticed by the cameraperson and subjects. Move towards them as if you are just casually walking across the room. Glance away to pretend you aren\u2019t paying attention to them. It may be that you are already in a great place right next to the people involved in the photo, in which case you should remain there, casually talking, sipping a drink, or looking away until you make your move into the photo. Be patient and don\u2019t pull a face or strike a pose until the photographer is just about to press the shutter button."

For a background photobomb, you should be behind the subjects or just to either side of them, ready to face the camera as they are. Ideally, you will never be noticed by the subjects, and maybe not even by the cameraperson. For a foreground photobomb, position yourself near the camera person to jump in front of the lens, between the camera and the subjects. This is harder to pull off unnoticed, as both the cameraperson and subjects are sure to notice you, even if you dart across the frame quickly."

Listen and watch for cues like the camera person counting down \u201c3...2...1!\u201d or announcing \u201cSay cheese!\u201d to the subjects. Pull a funny, weird, or super serious face for the maximum effect of surprise from the photo subjects when they look at the photo later."

If the cameraperson or subjects catch you in the act, just smile, be friendly, and assure them it was a lighthearted joke, especially if they are annoyed or being bad sports about their photo being ruined."

It will be more difficult to be stealthy for a group photobomb, so it\u2019s even more important that you wait till the last possible moment to jump into the frame. Make sure everyone in the group is in on the same plan of what to do and when to do it. This method can even be a pleasant surprise for the photo subjects. Have everyone in a wedding party sneak up behind the bride and groom for a silly wedding photo, for example."
