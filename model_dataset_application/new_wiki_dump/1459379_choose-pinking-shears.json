      "description":"Pinking shears aren't an essential tool in the sewing basket but they are a nice one to have. Besides creating non-fray edges for both stored and used fabrics, and seamed edges for sewn items, they make great edgings for easy jam jar lid covers and other crafty items, as well as making cute edges to craft projects that benefit from a naive art touch, such as small cushions and sachets. On the downside, a good pair will cost at least U$20.00, so if they are something you won't use all that often, so weigh up whether you want to own or a pair or whether you can borrow those of a friend or neighbor."
