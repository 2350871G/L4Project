          "headline":"Decide on the amount of down and fill-power you want.",
          "description":"Down are the fluffy feather clusters that grow underneath larger feathers on fowl like geese and ducks. The more down in a comforter, the softer and more comfortable it is likely to be. Choose a comforter with a high or \"pure\" down content for the most luxury. Fill-power refers to the amount of down per ounce. If you want an ultra-warm comforter, choose one with a fill-power rating of 650 or higher. A label stating 66% down means that the comforter is two-thirds down and one-third filling material, which may include another type of feather (which is usually larger and coarser than down) or a different type of material all together, such as cotton fill. For warmer weather, go for a comforter that has less fill so it won't be too hot and for cold weather look for higher fill for more insulation.

          "headline":"Go with a high thread count.",
          "description":"Thread count is an important consideration when purchasing a down comforter because the fine feathers, which compose the down, can poke through the fabric and work their way out if the thread count isn\u2019t high enough. The higher the thread count, the tighter the fabric, and the less likely you are to lose down feathers. Therefore, be sure to choose a comforter with a thread count of at least 250 or higher. Higher thread counts are also more expensive."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Pick a comforter with baffle-boxing or quilt-stitching.",
          "description":"These two terms refer to a specific way in which a down comforter is sewn together. Baffle-boxing means that the top and bottom fabric of the comforter are sewn together in a uniform pattern supported by additional fabric strips to create \u201cboxes.\" Similarly, quilt stitching is used to create specific pockets of down with stitched patterns. These two different binding techniques help hold feathers in place and keep an even distribution of down throughout the comforter. Comforters without baffle-boxing or quilt-stitching will likely have down that shifts over time (especially at the edges and in corners) with normal use, and this will not only decrease the comforter\u2019s warmth, but also its comfort level. Higher quality comforters will have both baffle-boxing and quilt-stitching, which will last longer and require less maintenance."

        {
          "headline":"Check out faux-down options.",
          "description":"Alternative-down comforters won\u2019t be as warm as true-down comforters, but they will be cheaper and they are a great option for people with allergies. Alternative-down comforters are worth looking into if you have a tight budget or have feather or animal dandruff sensitivities. Down alternatives are typically made from cotton, polyester, rayon, or combinations of the three. Not only are alternative-down comforters easier to wash and maintain, they are also guaranteed to be animal cruelty-free, making some of them vegan. If you are concerned about getting vegan products research the product beforehand to make sure no animal products were used."
