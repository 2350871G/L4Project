        {
          "headline":"Draw a U-shaped nose.",
          "description":"The nose should be 1/3 of the way down the bottom half of the face. Children tend to have small noses, without much nose bridge definition, so a simple nose will do for most kids. The child in the above illustration is a white girl, so the nose will be narrow."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Add a mouth.",
          "description":"The mouth should be placed approximately 2/3 of the way down. You may choose a simple curve for a smile, or an open mouth, or whatever you feel like."

        {
          "headline":"Draw the child's eyes.",
          "description":"The eyes should be big and rounded, with a large iris (the colored part). This will make the child look cute and young. Thicken the top eyelid to draw attention to the eyes and make them appear alert. Add raised eyebrows."

        {
          "headline":"Sketch the child's neck and shoulders.",

          "headline":"Draw the child's hair.",
          "description":"Many children with straight or wavy hair wear bangs. Children tend to have large foreheads, so be sure to add plenty of volume to the hair. This little girl's hair is straight, but that does not mean your lines will be. Gentle curves will give a sense of movement and make it more interesting. Notice how the bangs curve outward like a sphere to show volume."

In this image, the artist used a darker outline on the upper eyelids, the shadows on the chin, the corners of the mouth, and a few other places. If you are drawing digitally, lower the opacity of your sketch and draw your outline on a new layer."

The bottom of the nose, just like before, should be around 1/3 of the way down from the horizontal guideline. Younger children tend to have larger foreheads. The boy in the above image is quite young, so his forehead will be very big."

If you add lips, make them pointy and thin, because children's lips tend not to be very full yet. It should look roughly like an M-shape coming from the side of their face. White people tend to have the thinnest lips, while black people's lips are usually the fullest. This boy is Asian, so his lips are somewhere in the middle. Little girls' lips aren't usually fuller than boys' lips yet. Children look pretty androgynous."

Then draw a line coming down from one side of the face, and a curved line connecting the bottom of the line to the bottom of the circle. This will be the chin.

Notice how the hair curves outwards like stripes on a beach ball, showing that the child's head is round. The back of the neck attaches near the base of the ear. Go over your sketch with pen, refining details as needed. Notice how the upper eyelid has a darker line. Color your lineart if desired. Notice how the light and shadows hint at the roundness of the cheek, and the blue-gray highlights make the hair look shiny and clean. 3\\/4 View Draw another circle, this time placing the vertical line off to one side.
