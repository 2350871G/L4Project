Liked: Once again there are lots of things he likes. But, one easy item to give him is Fodder (he sells animal products so you could just buy fodder from him and give it, or you can purchase grass seeds and grow it yourself). He also likes any kind of wool from sheep, not to mention cow/chicken/sheep treats and Pet/Chicken feed. Disliked: Giving Neil a gem or ore, flowers and perfume will result in a loss of FP. Hated: He hates Poison Mushrooms, and any kind of dessert and Tea. Horror: This is the worst gift to give him. Giving him Chocolate Cake will result in an anger point being accumulated, along with losing 800FP."
