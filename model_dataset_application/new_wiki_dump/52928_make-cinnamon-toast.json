The cinnamon and sugar will fall into these ridges and make mixing easier. If the butter is cold, cut it into small pieces, then blend it in a mixer or food processor until it is soft."

Stir everything together with a rubber spatula until the texture is consistent. For extra flavor, add \u215b teaspoon of ground nutmeg. If you started with cold butter in a mixer, then continue to use the mixer here. Don't blend it too long, however, or the butter may start to melt."

As soon as you see the top turn golden brown and bubbly, switch the broiler off and take the toast out of the oven. Turn the oven light on so that you can see what's happening. If your oven doesn't have a window, you can peek at it every 30 seconds or so. You could also leave the oven open a crack and look at the toast that way."

Slice the toast in half diagonally, then put it on a plate. For smaller pieces, cut it in half diagonally both ways, like making an X. This will give you 4 triangles. For a more filling treat, serve the toast with some whipped cream, mascarpone, or sliced strawberries."
