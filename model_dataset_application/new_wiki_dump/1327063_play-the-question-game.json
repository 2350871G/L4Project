Playing Question and Answer Separate into small groups of four. These will be your teams. Give everyone in the group a piece of paper and a pen/pencil. Make sure each person has a writing utensil and uniform pieces of paper to write their questions on. Ensure that these groups of four are people who do not typically interact with one another.

Playing Questions Grab a partner to play with. The goal of the game is to ask as many questions as possible without making statements of any kind, hesitations, repeated, or rhetorical questions. The two players instead create and maintain a conversation by asking questions back and forth. Start the game by having the first player make the initial serve.
