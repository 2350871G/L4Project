  "text":" Making the Cake Combine everything but the flour, sour cream, and coffee. Add the butter, sugar, eggs, cocoa powder, baking soda, vanilla, and salt to a mixing bowl. Use a wooden spoon or electronic mixer to mix the ingredients together until everything is mixed evenly. Add the flour and sour cream. Measure out your flour and sour cream. Add these to the mixing bowl. Use a spoon or mixer to combine everything evenly. Add the coffee. The coffee should be hot and freshly brewed. Pour it into the mixture slowly as you stir. Keep stirring until you have a uniform batter. The batter should be smooth and even throughout and pour easily. Add the mixture to the pan. Pour your mixture into a greased 8 x 8 inch (20 x 20 cm) baking pan. Slowly pour the mixture into the pan, using a spoon or spatula to gradually push the mixture out. After the mixture is transferred to the pan, smooth out the top using the back of your spoon or your spatula. Bake the cake for 45 minutes at 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C). Once 45 minutes have passed, remove the cake from the oven using oven mitts. Set it on a cooling rack to cool off. The cake should be completely cool before you add the frosting or filling, so work on making the other ingredients while you let it sit out. Check to make sure the cake is done. Place a fork or skewer into the center of the cake. If the fork or skewer comes out clean, your cake is done. If you notice any uncooked batter, place the cake back in the oven and cook for one to two additional minutes and check again. Making the Frosting and Filling Whisk the milk and flour. Pour your milk and flour into a sauce pan. Use a wire whisk to the beat the milk and flour together over medium heat until you have a uniform, pudding-like mixture. Refrigerate the mixture. Place your sauce pan in the fridge. Leave the milk and flour mixture in the fridge until  it's cool. Cooling times will vary, but your mixture should cool off within 10 to 20 minutes. Cream the butter and sugar. While the mixture cools, add your butter and sugar to a mixing bowl. Use a fork to mash the butter, forming small ribbons. Then, mix the ribbons into your sugar. Keep going until you have an even, smooth mixture of butter and sugar. If you have an electronic mixture, you can save time by using this to cream the butter and sugar. Add the milk mixture to the butter and sugar. Pour the cooled milk mixture into your butter and sugar. Use an electronic mixture to whip all your ingredients together until you have a light, fluffy mixture. This generally takes around five minutes. Mix in half the confectioner's sugar and vanilla. Once you have a fluffy mixture, add half the confectioner's sugar and half the vanilla. Beat everything for a few more minutes until all the ingredients blend together. Make the frosting for the top. There is a separate chocolate frosting that goes on top of the cakes. To make it, place the cocoa powder into a small mixing bowl along with the remaining confectioner's sugar and vanilla. Beat everything together until it forms a thick frosting. Assembling the Zingers Cut your cake into 12 even pieces. Cut five vertical lines across the cake. Then separate them with a single horizontal line down the middle. Make sure the cake is completely cool to the touch before cutting it. Most cakes will cool within one to two hours. Place the filling in a bag. Take a small plastic Ziploc bag. Snip off one corner. Pour the filling into the bag, pushing the filling towards the open corner. Use the filling you made and not the separate chocolate frosting, which contains the cocoa powder. Fill each piece of cake. Take a single piece of cake. Push the open tip of the plastic bag into the top of a piece of cake near the center. You do not need to make a hole first, as the cake is not firm. Gently squeeze out the filling until the piece of cake bulges slightly. Pinch the cake shut. Once you've filled the cake with filling, use your fingers to pinch the sides together to secure the filling. A small amount of filling will squeeze out of the top. Repeat this same process with the remaining pieces of cake. Frost the cakes. Once you've filled each piece with filling, take the chocolate frosting you made earlier. Use a knife to add a small amount of frosting across the top of each cake. Create ridges with a fork. Take a fork and drag it along the frosting. This will create ridges, making your zingers look similar to the Hostess snacks. Store your zingers. Any zingers that don't get eaten right away should be stored in an airtight container in either the pantry or refrigerator. They will keep around five days in the pantry and one month in the refrigerator.",
