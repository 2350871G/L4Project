Choose some mild cheeses, like a fresh buffalo mozzarella with a mild flavor and creamy texture. Select others with strong flavors, like an herb Havarti. This will allow guests to experience the difference between mild and strong cheeses from various regions. Offer at least 1 commonly known cheese for every cheese that is lesser known. For example, prepare cheddar or Swiss if you're offering Havarti or Emmentaler. This will give guests who aren't familiar with rarer cheese varieties something that tastes familiar."

For example, if your party will have 6 people total and you plan to serve 6 different cheeses, you should buy 3 ounces (90 grams) of each type of cheese.

          "description":"This is especially important to do with younger varieties of red wine. You can aerate your wine by exposing it to the air in a decanter or in a large wine glass. Pour the wine into a decanter, which is a glass vessel with a wide body and narrow mouth, to expose wine to the maximum amount of oxygen. When decanting red wines, tip the wine bottle as little as possible. This will keep most of the sediment in the bottle instead of in the decanter. You can also aerate your wine by pouring it into a blender and pulsing it on high for 15-30 seconds. Dark red wines, like Shiraz and Syrah, that have a lot of tannins should be aerated for 1 to 2 hours before serving. This will reduce the tannic flavor."

Place the mildest cheese at the top of the plate and place the rest of the cheeses in order from mildest to strongest around the plate. For best results, bring all cheeses to room temperature about a half hour before serving to enhance their flavor.Tip: The flavors of cheeses that are made and then aged before being served, like Cheddar and Bleu, intensify as they are aged. This is why non-aged cheeses tend to have a milder flavor than aged varieties."
