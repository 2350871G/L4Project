Each pumpkin will yield a cup or so of puree. Look for pumpkins with bright orange flesh, no big bruises or gouges, and a relatively uniform shape. Heirloom pumpkins often have striated colors like yellow and green in addition to orange. These make great puree, too, but the color may not be the classic bright orange you're used to. Avoid decorative baby pumpkins - these don't contain enough meat to make much pumpkin puree, and they aren't grown to be eaten."
