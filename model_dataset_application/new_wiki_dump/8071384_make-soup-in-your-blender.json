Add one cup to a cup and a half of hot water to the mix so the soup will heat up while being blended. In addition to the main ingredients, add spices such as dill, cilantro, sea salt, and pepper to taste. Place one whole zucchini, 1 to 2 plum tomatoes, 1 to 2 stalks of celery, 1 sliver of red onion, and 1/2 to 1 garlic clove in the blender. You should blend the ingredients on high for about 90 seconds. However, the exact time varies depending on your blender. You may have to blend the ingredients longer to get a smooth, uniform texture."
