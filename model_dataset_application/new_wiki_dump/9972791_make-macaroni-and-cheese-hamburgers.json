  "text":" Making the Macaroni and Cheese Boil the elbows into a pot of salted water. Cook the pasta for about 7-8 minutes, depending on the box instructions. Drain the pasta in a colander. Shake the colander around to remove any excess water. Set aside. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir the butter around to help it melt. Add the flour, pepper, and salt to the butter. Combine and stir well for about 5 minutes until the mixture is smooth. Carefully pour in the milk, adding one cup at a time. Use a whisk to mix the ingredients properly. Keep stirring for about 5 minutes until the mixture starts bubbling. Fold in the cheddar cheese and mix until melted. Continue stirring for about 2-4 minutes until the sauce is smooth and fully melts. Pour the cheese sauce over the macaroni. Mix well with a wooden spoon until fully incorporated. Set aside to keep it warm. Cover the saucepan with a lid and place the heat on its lowest setting. This keeps the macaroni warm until you're ready to use it. Making the Hamburgers Preheat your grill to high heat.  Grease your grill with olive oil or butter.  Combine the ground beef, egg, and breadcrumbs in a large bowl.  Add the olive oil, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, cayenne pepper, and other desired seasonings. Mix once more until the ingredients are well-incorporated. Create the hamburger patties. Gather a few tablespoons of ground beef and form it into a patty by flattening it with your hands. Repeat until there is no more ground beef. Cook the hamburgers on the grill. Grill each side for about 5 minutes, until its brown and slightly crispy. Serve. Place the hamburgers on buns. Top with a desired amount of macaroni and cheese, along with any hamburger toppings.
