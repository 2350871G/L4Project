Crimping can be somewhat time consuming, but it will give you a definite 80s flair, and it will make even the flattest hair much more voluminous. Curling your hair with a curling iron or curlers then tossing it with your fingers and applying hairspray can also be a good way to make your hair bigger."

You may also be able to cut a long wig into a mullet style. Be sure to tell everyone that your hairstyle is \u201cbusiness in the front\u201d and \u201ca party in the back.\u201d"

An oversized shirt was often paired with a miniskirt or tightly-fitted pants or leggings.Tip: If you have an oversized sweatshirt, cutting the neck out of it so that it hangs off the shoulder will give it a more 80s look. Wear a tank top or sports bra underneath, preferably in a bright color. Tip: If you do not have oversized tops or undersized bottoms, try looking in your parents\u2019 closet (they may even have actual clothes from the 80s).

For example, electric blue pants and top can be accented with a bright yellow or pink belt and chunky earrings. Contrast your bright colors. If you do not have a matchy outfit, you can also put different bright colors together. Try to mix three or four different colors that are all different but all bright.

Men typically wore denim pants with denim jackets. Women wore denim miniskirts with a denim jacket. Men and women typically wore a tight shirt underneath the denim jacket. Combine denim and lace. A classic 80s look is a lace top paired with denim acid-wash jeans or a denim miniskirt. The contrast of drastically different materials is a key feature of 80s style."
