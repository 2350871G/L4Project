  "text":" Making the bunting template Draw a triangle shape onto card or cardboard. It is recommended to make the shape 5 x 5cm (2 x 2 inches). Cut the shape out. This is now your bunting template. Cover in kitchen foil. This will protect it from the grease in the cookies. Baking the cookies Preheat the oven to 180\u00ba/350\u00baF. Line the baking sheet/tray with parchment paper. Cream the butter and sugar.  Add the flour to the creamed mixture. Stir to combine well. Roll the dough to about 1cm/2.5\" thickness. The thickness is important because the cookies will be hanging and need to be substantial enough to prevent breaking. Cut the cookies. Place the template on the dough and cut around it. Repeat until you have cut all the dough. Roll the dough out again. Cut more cookies from the remaining piece. Arrange the cookie triangles on the prepared baking sheet/tray. Pierce a small hole a that center of the wide end of each triangle. This will be where you insert the bunting ribbon or cord when hanging. Suitable objects for piercing the hole in the cookies include: skewer, chopstick, toothpick or cocktail stick. Make the hole large enough for ribbon to pass through but not too large. Be careful to keep plenty of space between the hole and the upper edge of the cookie. Bake cookies. Place in the oven and bake for about 15-20 minutes, or until they turn golden brown. Icing the cookies Remove the cookies from the oven when baked. While still hot, check for any closed holes and use the tool to reopen these. Let the cookies sit on the baking sheet/tray for a few minutes, to prevent breakage when moved. Transfer the cookies to a wire cooling rack to finish cooling.  Make the icing while the cookies are cooling. Mix the icing sugar with the liquid flavoring of choice. If coloring, add food dye as well (see next step for theme suggestions).

Add any extras, such as drag\u00e9es, sprinkles, little candies, etc., while the icing is still wet. Let dry. Turning the cookies into bunting Thread the ribbon through the first cookie. Tie a knot to hold in place. Each time you add a cookie, angle the cookie to face forward; the knot will help the cookie to stay facing forward. Leave enough ribbon space for tying up the bunting before adding the first cookie. Leave a space between the first cookie and the next cookie. Thread through and tie a knot in place. Continue until all of the cookies are strung along the piece of ribbon. Leave enough space at the end of the ribbon for tying up the bunting. Hang the cookie bunting.
