  "text":" Part 1: Preparing the corks Drill holes directly down the center of each cork. This is really the only part that the kids can't do, so you'll need to prepare this first. Brush away any cork dust and broken pieces. Discard any corks that split during the drilling process. Cut one cork in half. This will be the head piece (the slit becomes the snake's mouth). Cover the workspace. Painting is a messy job, especially when the kids muck in! Use newspaper, a tarpaulin, etc. to cover the painting zone. Paint all of the corks. Choose a suitable color for the snake\u2013\u2013good colors include yellow, green, brown, black, red, etc. But your snake can be hot pink or neon orange if you want! Allow to dry before assembling the cork snake. Paint patterns. This step is optional but adds to the interest of the snake. Patterns can include stripes, zig zags, spots/dots, diamonds, triangles, etc. Again, allow to fully dry before assembling. Part 2: Assembling the cork snake Thread the length of elastic through one of the corks with holes in its middle.  Add a bead next.  Thread the next cork onto the elastic length. Again, add another bead. Continue in this way until all corks are threaded in place.  Make the tail end. Thread 4 to 6 beads onto the tail end to make the snake's tail. Knot firmly in place. Pull the elastic through the snake to draw together all of the corks and tail. Don't pull too tightly though; allow some give so that the snake can twist and turn. There should be a good amount of elastic left at the head end, which will both hold the head and form the snake's tongue. Part 3: Adding the head of the cork snake Make the eyes. Thread two eye colored beads onto the pipe cleaner. Place one half of the cut cork round side down under the extra piece of elastic at the head end of the snake. The cork should face the same way as all the other corks (that is, the long way, not sideways). Lay the elastic flat down on this cork half. Let the overlapping part stick out over the end of the cork half to become the tongue. Wrap the pipe cleaner around the cork half in such a way as to have the beads sit at the sides, evenly. These are the snake's eyes. Cut off any excess pipe cleaner. Glue the other cork half down on top of the cork half with the elastic on it. This completes the snake's head. Wrap a rubber band around the head to keep the cork halves together until the glue dries firmly. Finish the tongue. Cut the elastic down to a length that is suitable for the snake's tongue. Cut a V shape into the end of the elastic to mimic the forked tongue that snakes have. Paint this end piece of elastic a good tongue color, such as red, pink or blue. Done. The snake is now ready for play. If you want it to last longer, varnish the whole snake and allow this to dry before playing.",
