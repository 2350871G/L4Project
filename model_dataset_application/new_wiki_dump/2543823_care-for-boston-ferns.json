They do best in environments with humidity levels of at least 50 percent. If your daytime temperatures are between 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 24 degrees Celsius), and your nighttime temperatures are between 55 and 65 degrees Fahrenheit (13 to 18 degrees Celsius), your Boston ferns will thrive outdoors. You can place them on your porch or patio, and they should do well. The cooler temperatures at night will help to prevent fungus from developing."

The very best thing to do is to place it in a room with a humidifier. Keep your house between 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 24 degrees Celsius), and put it in a cooler room at night. If you don\u2019t want to invest in a humidifier, there are other options. You can place your fern in a saucer filled with small stones and water. The water will create humidity as it evaporates."

You don\u2019t want your fern to be in shade, but you don\u2019t want them to be in direct sunlight. It\u2019s a delicate balance."

Purchase houseplant food at your local gardening supply store. Read the instructions on the packaging, and dilute it so that it is half as strong for your fern.

Older leaves may become discolored or lose their leaves, which isn\u2019t the most aesthetically pleasing. Use sharp, clean scissors to remove the fronds all the way at the base.

Water them sparingly once per week and don\u2019t fertilize them at all during this time of year."
