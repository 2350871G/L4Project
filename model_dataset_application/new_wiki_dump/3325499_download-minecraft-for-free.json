The way Minecraft works is a little different than the way other games do in this regard: you can download Minecraft at any time for free, but you need to pay for an account to play the full version. To get the Minecraft \"launcher\" (the application you use to play the game), first go to Minecraft.net. On the right, you'll see three options: \"Get Minecraft,\" \"Play the demo,\" and \"Already bought the game? Download it here.\" Even though you haven't paid for it yet, pick the last option. On the next page, if you're working on a Windows PC, click the link for either Minecraft.msi or Minecraft.exe. Your download will start.

The biggest differences you may notice between the two versions are:\nThe demo version of the game is limited to a 100-minute play session. After that, you can still visit the world, but you cannot break or place blocks. The demo version of the game doesn't allow you to connect to servers. However, you can still play LAN multiplayer games. If you want the full game without having to pay, you can play version 1.2.5 (Which is around the time Jungles were added) and below, they do not require you to pay to play the full game."
