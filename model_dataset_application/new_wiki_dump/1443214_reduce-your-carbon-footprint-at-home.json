      "headline":"Eat local food.",
      "description":"Food often travels long distances between the time it is made and the time it reaches your kitchen. This requires extensive fuel use, which is usually in the form of either gasoline (petrol) or diesel, which are fuels that emit considerable amounts of carbon dioxide. Eating local foods means that the food you eat at home did not have to travel great distances. Thus, you are indirectly responsible for less carbon dioxide emissions than if you ate food from other areas."

    {
      "headline":"Reduce or eliminate your meat and/or dairy consumption.",
      "description":"Meat processing consumes a lot of fossil fuels, which contribute carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Studies have shown that diets that include meat involve nearly twice the amount of carbon emissions than vegetarian diets. Vegan diets, where neither meat or dairy is consumed, reduce carbon emissions sevenfold as compared to diets that include meat and dairy."

      "headline":"Reduce or eliminate your consumption of bottled water.",

      "description":"As incandescent light bulbs (the bulbs that have been common for many years) stop working, replace them with CFL light bulbs. Such bulbs use approximately 75 percent less energy than incandescent bulbs. Or even better with LED bulbs, which seem expensive, but last even longer than compact fluorescent light bulbs and don't contain the highly dangerous mercury. LED bulbs can pay themselves back in a few months because of reduced energy consumption."
