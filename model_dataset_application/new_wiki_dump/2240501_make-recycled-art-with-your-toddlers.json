  "text":" Recycled Bird Feeder Find used toilet paper rolls, or cut paper towel rolls in half.  Set up a work station covered with newspaper or a tablecloth that can be covered with paint.  Provide your toddler with non-toxic paint in a few colors and a paint brush. Explain how this project will be hung outside, near a tree. They may get inspiration from nature or choose to paint an abstract design. Ask your child to paint the outside of the toilet paper roll and the top and/or bottom of a paper plate. The roll will hold the seeds and the paper plate will be the platform where the birds eat the seeds. Allow both objects to dry. Use a hole punch to punch 3 equidistant holes at the top of the toilet paper roll.  Cut 2 small semi-circles at the bottom of the toilet paper roll. These will allow the seeds to spill out. Use strong glue to affix the bottom edges of the toilet paper roll to the center of the paper plate. Try not to put any glue on the semi-circles, so there is plenty of room for the seed to fall through. Allow it to dry for a few hours or overnight. String a piece of colorful yarn through the 3 holes at the top of the paper towel. The 3 holes will help to distribute the weight equally. Fill the toilet paper roll with bird seed. Hang it in a tree. Enjoy your recycled outdoor art. Tin Can Phone Find 2 used tin cans of approximately the same size.  Tape over the sharp edges with duct tape before bringing them to your toddler to decorate.  Give your toddler glue and glitter, stickers, paint and paintbrushes to help decorate the 2 tin cans. You can use almost any materials that you have lying around the house to wrap around the exterior of the tin cans. Allow the cans to dry if the glue or paint is wet. Take the cans away to a safe distance away from your toddler. Place the cans upside down. Place a nail on the bottom and center of each can and hammer it through the can. Repeat the process on the other can. Remove the nail and discard it in a safe area. Cut a piece of string that is approximately 10 feet (3 m) long.  Pull 1 end of the string through the hole in 1 can, from the outside to the inside. Knot the string when it is inside the tin can. Pull it to make sure it stays connected. Repeat the process with the other end of the string and the other can.  Teach your toddlers to use the phone by standing far enough apart so that the string is taut. Have the toddlers (or you and your toddler) take turns talking and listening through the phones. Paper Bag Kite Punch a hole into the center/top of each side of a paper grocery bag. Choose a small paper grocery bag or paper lunch bag for a very small toddler. You can use a hole punch to create even holes or a sharp pencil. Put hole reinforcements on each of the holes. These are found in office stores and they are commonly used to prevent paper holes from ripping. You can also reinforce them with masking tape. Cut 3 pieces of string approximately 30 inches (72 cm) long.  Loop 1 piece of string through the holes on opposite sides. Tie the string inside the holes so that it holds when you pick it up by the string. Make sure it is a loose loop. Loop the other piece of string through the opposite holes on the other sides. Tie it tightly. Loop the third piece of string through the 2 loops. Tie it in a knot in the middle. Then, tie a knot at the end of the string to form your handle. Set the paper bag on a covered craft table. Provide your toddler with non-toxic craft paint. Allow them to decorate it as them see fit. Another option is to decorate it like a tropical fish. Glue or paint eyes on the sides of the paper bag. Paint the bag with scales and fins. Find pieces of leftover crepe or tissue paper. Cut streamers out of the tissue paper. Glue the streamers onto the bottom of the paper bag, so that they will flow once it is in the air. Allow the paint and glue to dry before using.  Have your toddler grab the string handle and run with the kite. As the paper bag fills with air, it will float above the ground. Add a longer string handle if you want the kite to fly higher.",
