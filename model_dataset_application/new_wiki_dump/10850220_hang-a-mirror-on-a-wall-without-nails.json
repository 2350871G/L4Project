Remove 1 liner from 1 sticky side of each of your double-sided strips and attach them to your frame. Always hang them vertically on the left and right for the best results, with 1 at the top right, 1 at the top left, 1 at the bottom right, and 1 at the bottom left. If they're not in pre-cut strips, give yourself around 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) per piece. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for your brand of tape for specific directions."

For example, if your mirror is 10 inches (25 cm) long from left to right, position a hook 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) from the left side and 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) from the right side. You can also try positioning just 1 hook in the middle. Take care to get your paper aligned exactly where you want it before marking the holes off. In general, only 2 small holes are necessary."

Once they're facing the right direction, push the hooks completely into the wall until only the hooks are visible. Head to the picture hanger section of the local home hardware store and purchase steel hooks for a mirror with the given weight. Example products include Monkey Hook, Hercules Hook, or Super Hook. Hooks work best on drywall. However, they also work on plaster, but they will be tougher to get into the wall. Most hooks are about 1 inch (2.5 cm) in length. Make sure that only the hook is exposed from the wall.
