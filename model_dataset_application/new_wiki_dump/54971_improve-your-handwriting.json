If you\u2019re not feeling too creative, simply copy a passage out of a book or newspaper. The goal is to get an idea of what your handwriting looks like on average. The more you write, the more accurate your analysis will be."

          "headline":"Look for a slant.",
          "description":"The angle at which you write your letters can make or break your handwriting. Is your handwriting perpendicular to the lines under it? Does it fall to the left or to the right significantly? A slight slant is typically not a problem, but too much of one can make reading difficult."

          "headline":"Look at the spacing.",
          "description":"The distance between your words and letters helps determine the quality of your handwriting. There should be enough space between each word to fit the letter \u201cO.\u201d Using more or less space than this can be an indicator of poor handwriting. Pay attention also to the closeness of each individual letter. Cramped writing or letters that are spaced far apart are also difficult to read."

          "headline":"Analyze your line quality.",

Possible changes can be made to the shape of letters, your spacing, alignment, writing size, line quality, and the slant of words. Changing one or more of these will improve your overall handwriting legibility."

Make a copy of each style of handwriting that is feasible for you to mimic. Don\u2019t be afraid to look for samples that might vary significantly from your own handwriting, as you can pick and choose certain aspects of different handwritings rather than adopting an entirely new one."

Avoid \u201cdrawing\u201d letters with your hand, and instead write by moving your entire arm up to the shoulder. To practice doing this, the easiest thing is to write sentences in the air using your finger. This forces you to use the muscle groups in your arm and shoulder that help to improve handwriting and keep it from looking messy or cramped."

The end of the writing utensil should rest against either the web of your hand or against the knuckle of your index finger. Holding your pencil too tightly or loosely (in this position or others) will result in poor handwriting. Hold the pencil in the bottom \u2153 for the best results."

All the letters are made up out of straight lines and circles or semi-circles, so put in some time drawing these. Fill an entire sheet of paper with parallel vertical lines, and parallel diagonal lines. Do the same with a sheet of \u2018o\u2019 shapes as well. When you can consistently make the same line over and over, you are ready to move onto complete letters."

Following the correct direction of the line that forms each letter can greatly improve your handwriting. For example, rather than starting a lowercase \u2018a\u2019 with the tail, begin at the top of the loop. Practice writing every letter in the correct direction, just like how you were taught in kindergarten."

Try a variety of tools including a ballpoint, roll-on, and felt pen in addition to traditional and mechanical pencils. Finding one that you enjoy writing with may be enough to improve your handwriting on its own."

Use your font inspiration that you gathered as well as your handwriting analysis to focus on what you need to change. If slanting is your problem, make it a point to keep your letters vertical. If you are trying to change the shapes of your letters, concentrate simulating the shapes you see in the handwriting inspiration you\u2019ve chosen."

Write the phrase \u201cthe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\u201d over and over again\u2014this particular sentence contains every letter of the alphabet, giving you ample practice time.
