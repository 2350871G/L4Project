If the water pools on the surface for hours afterward, then consider another space or add more drainage. A ginger rhizome should be firm to the touch when pulled from the ground. If your rhizome feels soft or mushy, then it's possible that it was waterlogged in the soil."

          "description":"When you water your ginger for the first time, mix in a slow-release fertilizer. Then, in 2-week intervals, water your plant with a liquid fertilizer. Carefully read and follow the instructions on the fertilizer packages to get the best results and to be safe. If there is a lot of organic matter in your soil, you won't have to fertilize. Try to choose an organic fertilizer to minimize the exposure to chemicals. Consider using fertilizer if your rhizomes are stunted. If your ginger is tiny when harvested, then it's possible that they did not receive enough nutrients."

          "description":"Root knot nematodes are tiny worms who can infect and damage your ginger crop. To get rid of them, once you've removed your ginger, plant a brassica genus plant, such as broccoli or kale, in the same soil. You can also heat up the soil around your ginger plant (prior to harvesting) by circling the base of the shoots with a plastic sheet to trap the sun's rays. If your ginger rhizomes look excessively lumpy with large pits, these are signs of a nematode infestation. If you don't treat the soil by rotation and continue to plant in the same area, then your future ginger crops will likely suffer from these pests, too. They are based out of the soil."

This gives the plant plenty of opportunities to absorb the heat and develop an extensive root system. Then, the plant will be mature and ready to remove from the ground by the middle or end of the fall months. A good growing estimate is that your plants will start to develop roots after 2 months.

The rhizome should be pretty easy to spot in the soil, as it will appear white or a light brown against the darker color of the dirt.

Look for a rhizome while you are digging and if you locate one, use your trowel to slice off an end piece. Then, refill your hole with dirt and the ginger will continue to mature and grow. This is a great way to quickly and cleanly get ginger for a meal. It only takes minutes and doesn't harm the plant. If you don't find a rhizome with your initial small hole, dig slightly to one side or another."
