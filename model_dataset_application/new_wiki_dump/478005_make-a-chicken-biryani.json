You can tell how cooked the rice is by taking a grain and pressing it with your fingers. The rice should break apart into pieces, but still have a hard texture to it.

Preparing The Biryani Place chicken into a thick bottom pot. Traditionally, biryani is cooked in an Indian cooking pot called a biryani handi, but any thick bottom pot will work just fine. A non-stick pot/handi works best. Spread the chicken so each piece of chicken is touching the bottom and/or sides of the pot. This will help ensure that each piece of chicken gets cooked thoroughly.

With your perforated spoon, pack the rice firmly into the pot. It is okay if some water comes along with the rice, it will help things cook with the steam. On top of the rice, sprinkle on fried onions(approximately 2 tbsp), chopped coriander leaves(approximately 1tbsp), and mint leaves (approximately 8-10). You can also sprinkle on cashew or golden raisins, but these are optional. Add the next layer of rice. This is the second, and final layer of rice you will be adding to the biryani. Once the rest of the rest is spread evenly, add on the rest of the brown onions (approximately 1 tbsp), a little bit more coriander leaves (approximately 1/2 tbsp), mint leaves (3-5), the saffron milk mixture, and approximately 6 tbsp of ghee. An alternative and optional topping is adding some rose water. Just add about 1/2 a capful, and sprinkle it over the top of the biryani. Put the lid on the pot upside down. Roll the chapati dough into long pieces and put the dough on the edges of the pot's upside down lid. You add the chapati dough to the edges of the lid, so when you turn the lid right side up, the dough seals the pot so the chicken and rice can steam cook together. Press lightly but firmly to make sure the lid is secure and tight. You can add a weight to the lid to ensure that it stays sealed, but usually if you use the dough, it is sealed good enough. Cook the biryani. Keep the biryani cooking for about 5-10 on high flame. Then, take the pot off the flame, put a cooking plate on the flame, and place the pot back on the flame with the cooking plate. This is the safest method to cook the biryani and make sure the biryani doesn't burn because of the direct contact with the heat. After about 35 switch off the flame, but don't open the biryani yet. Let the biryani sit for another 10 minutes. Carefully remove the pot's top. The dough will be a little cooked and hardened, but crack through it, and take of the top to check the biryani. A lot of steam will come out so be careful not to burn yourself. Slowly stick a large spoon on the inside side of the hand and lift to get the bottom layers of the rice out. Then, as you work your way down, bring up a piece of chicken. The pieces of chicken should have a brown coloring. Enjoy! Usually, biryani is eaten with your hands, and is served with raita, a cold, refreshing, yogurt condiment.",
