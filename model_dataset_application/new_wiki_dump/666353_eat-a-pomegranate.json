There are two main ways to eat pomegranate on its own:\nEat the arils with a spoon, like you would eat a bowl of cereal. You can eat the hard seeds, or spit them out. You can also cut the pomegranate into large chunks, pick them up, and bite down on the seeds. This is a messier method and will require lots of clean up. Also, the skin of the pomegranate can be a bit bitter so you should avoid biting into it too much. This method is for people who like a more active eating experience."
