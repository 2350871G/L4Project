If you have a very delicate plant that needs a specific amount of water, you can use a smaller water bottle and turn it into a watering can in the same way. Don\u2019t make the holes too large. Smaller holes will prevent the water from coming out too fast. The holes should be larger than a pin hole but not larger than a pencil. You want to be able to control the flow of water."

Then plant the bottle all the way into the ground closely to the plant, leaving just the top of the bottle visible. Pour water in the top of the bottle whenever you want to water the plant.

Poke one hole in one of the \"flower petals\" and place string, fishing line, or something similar through the holes. Make sure the type of string or line fits snugly into the holes. If the pieces won't stay, you may need to put a little glue around the hole so the plastic flowers won't move. To construct the whole decoration, you can place one of the strung \"flowers\" on each line or string three or four on the same string. Hang multiple in a row together for a dangling wind decoration.
