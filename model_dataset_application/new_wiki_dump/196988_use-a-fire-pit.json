If you haven\u2019t built the in-ground fire pit, make sure you pick a place that will stay clear of any plant life for years. It\u2019s best to pick an open flat area for your guests as well.

An upside down fire means placing your larger logs in first and stacking smaller logs, tinder, and kindling on top. Place your large logs in the bottom of your pit, and spread the logs out to cover the base. Then, place your smaller logs on top in a criss-cross pattern to allow for airflow. Add your tinder. Create a small pile or ball with your tinder. You can even tie it up with some string if you need. If your tinder is too spread out it won\u2019t create enough heat at once to ignite the rest of your materials. Place smaller twigs and other kindling on top of the tinder bundle in a tepee-like fashion. These small branches will quickly catch fire and help to ignite your larger logs. The tepee shape of your kindling will create a small pocket of heat from your tinder and ensure that your kindling gets an even burn. Never use pressure treated wood. It emits toxic fumes. You can tell if the wood is pressure treated by its green tint."

If you are using any newspaper, you can also shove balls of it between your larger logs and light the newspaper. Softwoods such as pines and firs are easier to light and are good for getting your fire started. As your fire begins to burn it will create coals and embers.

You can then place your larger logs around your kindling. Keep a little open area so you can easily reach in and light your tinder. If you're breaking in your chimenea, don\u2019t add larger logs, just use kindling and smaller sticks. For a criss-cross, or log cabin stacking method, stack a few logs over your bricks. Add your tinder, then stack your kindling over in a criss-cross. You don\u2019t need a lot of wood as the chimenea is meant for smaller fires. Never use pressure treated wood. It emits toxic fumes.

Pine wood is a good option in a chimenea as it smells nice, wards off mosquitos, and burns well without getting too hot. Hardwoods like oak, ash, cherry, maple, will burn best in your chimenea as these don\u2019t produce as many sparks and last longer than softwoods.

These items contain chemicals which get into the smoke and can get on your food. Make sure that you use dry wood. If there\u2019s any moisture in the wood, it will be harder to start your fire. You can easily find tinder in your own yard from dry grass and leaves that you rake up. Otherwise, newspaper works well. Keep a bucket of dirt or sand nearby in case you need to put your fire out quickly. Consider placing a few bricks in the bed of your chimenea as well, to act as a bed for your wood. You can stack the logs on top of the bricks. Place your materials in your fire pit. Your chimenea is similar to a fireplace inside a home. So you can stack your materials with the larger pieces on the bottom. Or you can use the teepee method. If your chimenea is relatively new, it\u2019s a good idea to start with small fires the first couple of times. This will season your chimenea and not cause it to overheat or break. To make a teepee fire, place your tinder in the bottom of your bowl. Keep your tinder in a ball and lay your kindling around it. Stack the sticks around your tinder in the shape of a teepee. You can then place your larger logs around your kindling. Keep a little open area so you can easily reach in and light your tinder. If you're breaking in your chimenea, don\u2019t add larger logs, just use kindling and smaller sticks. For a criss-cross, or log cabin stacking method, stack a few logs over your bricks. Add your tinder, then stack your kindling over in a criss-cross. You don\u2019t need a lot of wood as the chimenea is meant for smaller fires. Never use pressure treated wood. It emits toxic fumes. You can tell if the wood is pressure treated by its green tint. Light the fire. Don\u2019t fill your chimenea with too much wood. Your fire should be small enough so it does not ascend into the smokestack. When lighting your fire, the safest way is to use a long match or lighter. You may want to light your tinder in a couple places to help the fire get going. If you are using any newspaper, you can also shove balls of it under your larger logs. Light the newspaper with your tinder. Pine wood is a good option in a chimenea as it smells nice, wards off mosquitos, and burns well without getting too hot. Hardwoods like oak, ash, cherry, maple, will burn best in your chimenea as these don\u2019t produce as many sparks and last longer than softwoods. If you do plan to use wood that emits more sparks, use a spark arrestor. This metal piece of equipment goes inside your smokestack and will extinguish sparks. Maintain your fire. As your wood begins to burn down it will create coals. You can use these coals to keep start new logs, or for cooking. Be careful not to add too much new wood, causing your fire to get too high. Use a poker or large stick to move your coals and embers together. Add some oxygen by blowing on the coals to add more heat. Put out your fire. Once you\u2019re done enjoying your fire pit, properly put out the fire. Never use water to put a fire out in your chimenea, especially if you have a clay one. The shock from the temperature change can break the clay. Let the fire go out naturally. If you\u2019ve been properly monitoring your fire, you won\u2019t have put too much wood in your chimenea. If you have a lid for your smokestack, place it over to restrict air flow. You can also dump sand on your embers to help extinguish the fire. Keep your chimenea in good shape. A chimenea needs a bit more attention than other types of fire pits due to the materials it's made of and design. Invest in a waterproof cover to keep it dry. Chiminea sealer will help to keep the clay from cracking. When you shovel out your ashes, rinse any rocks you have in the bottom. Let the rocks dry completely.",
