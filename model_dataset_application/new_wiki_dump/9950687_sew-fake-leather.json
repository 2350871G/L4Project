          "description":"If you are using a pattern to sew fake leather, you will need to use the pieces as your guides for cutting. To avoid damaging fake leather fabric, use paper weights to hold the pattern pieces in place on top of the fake leather fabric. You can use paper weights, clean rocks, or any other small, heavy item to hold the pattern pieces in place. Make sure that you use plenty of weights to hold down all of the edges of the pattern pieces. Place a weight every 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) along the edges of the pattern pieces."

          "headline":"Cut fake leather with a rotary cutter and cutting mat.",
          "description":"It is important to have a sharp tool to cut fake leather since it tends to be thick. Place the leather on a plastic cutting mat and use a rotary cutting tool to cut the fake leather along the edges of the pattern. You use a rotary cutting tool similar to how you would cut a pizza. Hold the rotary tool by the handle and roll the blade over the areas of the fake leather fabric you want to cut. If you do not have a rotary cutting tool, then you can use a pair of very sharp scissors. Just be careful not to move the weights when you cut the fabric. Hold the scissors close to the table or other surface that the fake leather is resting on."

          "headline":"Use binder clips to hold the cut fake leather pieces together.",
          "description":"After you cut the fake leather into the shapes required for your sewing pattern, use binder clips to connect the pieces as indicated by the pattern. Binder clips will not penetrate the fabric the way that pins will, so you will be less likely to damage the fabric. Place a binder clip about every 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) along the edges of the fabric pieces. You will need to remove the binder clips before you sew each area of the fake leather."

          "description":"Ironing down folded edges of the fake leather fabric before you sew them may help to make it easier to sew fake leather fabric. If your iron has a synthetic setting, set it to that. You should also place a t-shirt or thin towel over the fake leather fabric before you sew. If your iron does not have a synthetic setting, then use the lowest possible setting."

          "headline":"Plan where you will sew and sew only once across an area.",
          "description":"Fake leather material will tear if you sew over it too many times, so it is best to only sew across an area of the fabric 1 time. Identify where you want your stitches to go before you start sewing. Try using chalk to mark the areas where you want to stitch the fake leather. Do not backstitch with fake leather. Even this small amount of extra stitching can weaken the fabric."

Consult your sewing machine for instructions on how to set it to the zigzag stitch."

Locate the stitch width dial or control button on your sewing machine and adjust the stitch length so that it is on one of the wider settings, 3.5 or higher.

To make it easier to sew the fake leather fabric, adjust the thread tension on your sewing machine by turning the dial at the top of the machine near the area where the thread feeds through. Turn the dial to the left by about 1 quarter to 1 half of a turn to loosen the thread. Test the stitches on a piece of scrap fabric to see if you need to adjust the tension more. If the thread bunches up on the back of the fabric, you have loosened the tension too much."

To ensure strong stitches in fake leather fabric, make sure to use thread that is thick enough to hold the leather fabric together.
