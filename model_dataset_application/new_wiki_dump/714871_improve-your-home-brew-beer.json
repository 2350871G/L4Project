      "description":"Many recipes call for a 60 minute boil. After the 60 minute boil, the standard recipe will call for a 10 minute flavoring simmer. Boil the wort for whatever time that gives you the desired mix of aroma, flavor, and bitterness. Hop characteristics are dictated by boiling times. According to the Brewmasters at Brew Supplies, the peak aroma is achieved at about 7 minutes after the start of the boil, and is almost completely lost at 15 minutes. Peak flavor is about 20 minutes into the boil, and is almost completely lost at 40 minutes. All that is left is bitterness, which is fully achieved at approximately 60 minutes. Beer is not intended to have only one of these characteristics. Aroma, flavor, and bitterness are all necessary in their proportion to make the pallet desired."
