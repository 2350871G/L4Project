          "description":"When meal planning, it can help your budget to check the local ads as you plan. That way, you can incorporate what's on sale into your menus, so you save money and you and your family can eat better. If you don't get your grocery stores' ads in the mail, try looking online to find the ads for the places you shop at most."

          "headline":"Compare the ads to your typical recipes.",
          "description":"Once you figure out what's on sale, compare that to recipes you normally fix. Of course, you can try out something new once in awhile, but when you're fixing something new, you're not likely to have dinner on the table in 30 minutes. Add meal planning to your schedule so you don't try to skip it."

          "description":"That is, to keep things simple, you don't have to try a new recipe every night or even every week. If you want, you can assign one thing to each day of the week, such as \"salad Mondays, taco Tuesdays, etc.\" You can even take it a step farther and assign a specific recipe to each day of the week, such as \"tuna salad Mondays, beef taco Tuesdays.\" As long as they're recipes you and your family like, it shouldn't be a problem. You can get a little crazier on the weekends when you have more time. Plus, sticking to recipes you know means you'll become an expert at them, and you can have dinner on the table in record time. You don't have to keep the same five recipes all year. Try changing them out by season, for instance. Make sure to pick recipes that are different from one another so that you don't get sick of them."

Alternatively, if you're chopping half an onion for one dinner, chop the rest of it for a dinner later that week. Doing some prep work ahead of time helps you get dinner on the table faster during the week. Alternatively, you can buy fresh or frozen vegetables that are already chopped for you, saving you time."

For instance, if you know you're going to make several dishes that need rice (chicken and rice, then fried rice), cook a big batch on Sunday for the rest of the week. Alternatively, if several dishes take sauteed onions, go ahead and saute an onion or two up for the week. You can also cook other whole grains and beans ahead, such as barley, lentils, black beans, or quinoa. Most of them even freeze well, so you can make a really large batch and save smaller portions for later."

          "description":"Another good option to keep you full and healthy throughout the week is to make a big batch of roasted vegetables over the weekend. You could do all root and starchy vegetables, like carrots, parsnips, beets, sweet potatoes, and butternut squash, or you could a mixture of greener varieties, such as broccoli, cauliflower, onions, mushrooms, and bell peppers. All you need to do is spray a roasting pan with cooking spray. Chop the veggies into about 1-inch pieces. The specific size doesn't matter as much as the pieces being roughly the same size. Drizzle with oil, and sprinkle with salt, pepper, and your favorite seasonings. Cook at 425 Fahrenheit (218 Celsius). Turn them at 15 minutes, though some vegetables may take as long as an hour to cook, depending on how many you have in the oven."

You can make a big batch and then freeze it into smaller batches. You can also make a double batch of a casserole, one to eat and one to freeze for later. When you need to use your freeze-ahead meal, you can thaw it in the refrigerator overnight, thaw it in the microwave, or in some cases (such as casseroles), cook it from frozen."

There's a wide variety of sauces out there now; you just have to find the ones you like. Another option is to make batches of sauce yourself over the weekend.
