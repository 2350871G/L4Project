Consider putting your hamster in a different room while you clean, so that the smell of disinfectant does not bother him. If you do not have a back-up cage, consider buying a different type of container for your hamster. A popular choice is a large ball made for hamsters to roll around in. Check your local pet store for these items. Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly before handling your hamster. This will get rid of any unfamiliar scents and let him get used to your natural scent."

Provide about one teaspoon of the seed mix per day. Use a ceramic food dish instead of a plastic one. Ceramic is more resistant to chewing. Place the food dish as far as possible from your hamster's bathroom corner. Hamsters are creatures of habit, and also very clean. They prefer their food to be separate from other activities."

Running wheels can be purchased at pet supply stores and make a great addition to your hamster's home. During your weekly cage cleaning, take a few minutes to clean the wheel. You can purchase either a plastic or metal wheel. Both can be cleaned with warm water and a mild soap. Take the wheel out of the cage for cleaning, so that you can easily access all surfaces."

It is not necessary (or advisable) to use a disinfectant on food and water dishes. For the toys and the cage, choose a disinfectant carefully. You want a product that is strong enough to kill germs, but safe for your pet. It is a good idea to ask your vet for a recommendation. If you cannot find a suitable product, you can make your own disinfectant. Make a bleach solution of 1/2 cup bleach to 1 gallon of water. Apply this solution to all items that your hamster uses. After disinfecting everything, rinse with water. Thoroughly dry all toys and accessories with paper towels or clean cloths."
