          "description":"Most tofu blocks will come packed with water, and you\u2019ll need to remove as much of this stored moisture as possible to allow the tofu to soak up flavor. Lay your slices from the previous step out on a paper towel. Add a layer of paper towels on top of them, then place a heavy object on top of these paper towels to press the tofu. A convenient heavy object you can use might be an iron skillet or a particularly heavy cookbook. How long you should press the tofu may depend on what your recipe calls for, but in general, you should let your tofu slices sit and drain for at least 1 hour before proceeding."

          "headline":"Cut your tofu into 0.5 in (1.3 cm) cubes.",
          "description":"Although your cubes can be bigger than this, smaller tofu cubes will absorb flavor more efficiently and be easier to cook. Different recipes may call for different sizes and shapes of tofu, although slicing your tofu cubes to this size will give them a dense, juicy core surrounded by a crisp crust. Tofu can also be cooked in slabs, speared chunks, or crumbles. Experiment with different cut sizes to see what works best for you. If you plan to crumble your tofu instead of slicing it, consider using soft tofu as opposed to firm or extra-firm tofu. Soft tofu has a custard-like texture, and will be much easier to crumble by hand."

          "headline":"Coat the cubes with cornstarch before adding dry seasoning.",
          "description":"Place 2 US tbsp (30 mL) cornstarch in a small bowl and add your tofu cubes. Toss the cubes in the bowl until they have a light cornstarch coat. The cornstarch will absorb any excess moisture still left in your tofu cubes and give them a crispy crust after cooking. You might also use arrowroot powder instead of cornstarch. Adding cornstarch is especially important for frying tofu. If you\u2019re baking or steaming tofu, however, you may be able to skip this step. When you apply cornstarch to tofu depends on which type of seasoning you will use. If using dry seasoning, toss your tofu before seasoning it. If using a marinade, toss your tofu in cornstarch after seasoning it."

Finally, dip each side of each tofu slice in your blackened seasoning mixture. A 14 oz (400 g) block of tofu should be enough for this amount of seasoning. Make sure each tofu slice is generously coated with your spice mixture after you dip it into the bowl. For best results, grill your slices on a medium-hot grill for 5 minutes on each side. Blackened seasoning is a spice blend with a black pepper and paprika base, and is very popular with grilled chicken and fish."
