To avoid hitting other cars or objects, press the Left and Right Arrow keys very subtly each time you need to switch lanes. Turning too sharply at such a high speed will cause you to spin out and crash. If you hit an object/car before you are able to record your Perfect Nitrous, wait for the Nitrous dial to refill again, and then repeat steps 4 and 5 to try again."
