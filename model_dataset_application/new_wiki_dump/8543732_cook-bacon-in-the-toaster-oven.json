  "text":" Beginning the Cooking Process Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. To start, take out a baking sheet that will fit in your toaster oven. Line the baking sheet with aluminum foil. This will make clean up easier afterwards, as you can simply remove the foil and discard it. If you don't have aluminum foil, you can use parchment paper instead. Place the bacon flat on the baking sheet. Keep the bacon separated. It should not be touching or overlapping. Lie the bacon flat on the bacon sheet so it cooks completely. Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly after handling raw bacon. Place a sheet pan under the wire tray in your toaster oven. You should find a sheet pan that fits on the bottom of your toaster oven. If any bacon drips during the cooking process, a sheet pan will catch this. It is easier to remove the pan and clean it than clean the bottom of a toaster oven. Cooking Your Bacon Set the toaster oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (205 degrees Celsius). If you're not sure how to set the temperature on your toaster oven, refer to the instructions manual. Allow the toaster oven to heat completely before adding your bacon. Usually, a light goes on or off to indicate the oven is done heating. Cook the bacon for 10 to 15 minutes. Keep an eye on the bacon while it cooks. It usually takes between 10 to 15 minutes, but thinner bacon may cook quicker. Bacon will curl and crisp slightly just before it's done. For crispier bacon, cook your bacon longer. Remove the bacon from the oven. After your bacon is cooked to your desired crispness, remove it from the toaster oven. Place some paper towels on a plate. Remove your bacon with a spatula and transfer it to the paper towels. These will remove any excess grease. Allow the bacon to cool for a few minutes before eating. Reheating Your Bacon Store bacon you do not use for later. If you do not eat all your bacon, you can store it for later. Place the bacon in a plastic container. Then, place the container in the freezer. Cook the bacon in the microwave for 20 to 30 seconds. Bacon thaws easily in the microwave. Once you're ready to eat your leftover bacon, put it on a microwave safe plate. Heat it up for 20 to 30 seconds. Season the bacon with salt and pepper. Bacon may lose some flavor after being stored.
