Remove the labels (soaking them makes it easier) and clean the inside of the bottle to remove all drink. Ensure that it is completely dried inside before using the bottle. Fill the bottle with glitter. Leave a small space at the top so that the glitter can move about freely within the bottle when shaken.

The glitter bottle can be used to shake for entertainment and visual appeal or it can be used as a practical item, as the glitter container for your craft projects. Calming Glitter Bottle Know what a calming glitter bottle is used for. The idea behind this bottle is that it can either be a source of calming you by staring at it or it can be used for timing a time-out with a misbehaving toddler. Either way, it's a beautiful object to stare at. Select a suitable bottle. This could be a soda bottle, juice bottle or any other good bottle. It doesn't have to be plastic but if it is to be used by toddlers, plastic is safest. Adults may prefer to use glass, just ensure it is clear glass so that you can see the glitter easily. Obtain the glitter. You'll need both glitter glue and ultra fine glitter as these two make for the most interesting mixture once added. Pour in ordinary water to three quarters of the way. Use a funnel to make this easier to do. Add one bottle of the glitter glue. Add another small container of the ultra fine glitter to complete the glittery look. Add the lid. Screw on tightly. Give the bottle a shake to check that you're happy with the outcome. If not, add more ultra fine glitter until you like the appearance. Use. To use it, simply shake the bottle and watch the swirls that happen. Keep shaking as often as you like, but you should find it a calming experience fairly quickly.

Rainbow Glitter Bottles Select seven bottles, one for each color of the rainbow.
