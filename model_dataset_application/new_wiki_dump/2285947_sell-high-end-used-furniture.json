          "headline":"Find a manufacturer\u2019s mark for proof of authenticity.",
          "description":"Many high-end furniture manufacturers tag their furniture. This stamp could be anywhere, so look all over for it. Inspect the back end and look inside of it if you don\u2019t see the mark right away. Take advantage of marks to both confirm the quality of a piece of furniture and to help track down its estimated retail price. For example, a manufacturer might place a mark on the back of a chair. It might be on a drawer inside of a dresser or wardrobe. When you find a manufacturer\u2019s mark, take a picture of it. You can use it to determine who made the furniture and what it is worth by looking through catalogues. Then, show off the mark when you\u2019re advertising. You may have received a certificate of authenticity or something similar when buying the furniture. Save it, especially if the furniture doesn\u2019t have a mark to distinguish it."

          "headline":"Inspect the furniture for scratches and other signs of damage.",
          "description":"The furniture\u2019s condition has a big impact on the sale price. If the furniture is dinged, damaged, and worn out, you can\u2019t expect to get a lot of money for it. On the other hand, if it looks like it belongs in a catalogue, you can put a higher price on it. If your furniture is in pretty bad shape, consider having it fixed first. For example, refinish or reupholster it to potentially increase its value."

        {
          "headline":"Test the furniture\u2019s quality by touching and using it.",
          "description":"Truly high-end furniture feels sturdy because it is made with quality material and crafting techniques. Check that the furniture is made from solid material cut to fit together without staples, nails, or a ton of glue. Lift and pull various parts to see if they squeak or twist. For upholstery, squeeze the fabric to see if you can feel the furniture\u2019s frame through it. Furniture made from solid wood is worth more than anything made from thin plywood or other materials. Premium options like mahogany and maple are typically a sign of high-end quality. Natural fabrics like European linen, cotton, leather, and down stuffing are often signs of a piece of furniture that is worth more than usual. By contrast, synthetics are often used in more inexpensive furniture."

          "headline":"Look up sales to find the approximate value of the furniture.",
          "description":"If you bought the furniture yourself, remember how much you got it for. If you\u2019re uncertain, try searching for similar pieces of furniture. Uncover what they go for both new and used. Search for the manufacturer\u2019s website, if they have one, to get started. Many manufacturers have online catalogues. If you\u2019re selling an older piece of furniture, check out antique databases and marketplaces online. If you don\u2019t know the manufacturer or are dealing with an antique, browse marketplace listing and completed sales on auction websites."

        {
          "headline":"Contact a professional appraiser for a price estimate if you need one.",
          "description":"The best way to do this is by seeking out an appraisal service in your area. For a decent fee, often $200 to $400 USD, they will give you some background on the furniture and tell you how much it is worth. You also get a certificate of appraisal you can show off when negotiating a sale. Since high-end furniture can be pretty expensive, appraisals are usually worth doing despite the fee. If you don\u2019t think your item is worth much, then the appraisal won\u2019t be worth doing. Search for online services that can perform appraisals at a reduced cost. You could also try visiting an auction house or furniture seller for a free verbal appraisal."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Price your furniture according to its condition and value.",
          "description":"Make sure the asking price is a prominent part of your advertisement. To start, determine the original value of the furniture. Then, take into account its age and overall condition to reach a fair price. If you had any professional appraisals done, use them for a baseline estimate. For a basic price estimate, start with the retail price and subtract 20% to 30% from it. Take off extra for wear and tear or damage. Factor in the demand. Selling high-end furniture often involves waiting for a buyer to come along. You may need to drop the price lower than you anticipate to attract more buyers. Pick a realistic price, but have an idea of what you will settle for. For example, you might decide that your Heywood Wakefield armoire is worth $3,500 but is more likely to sell for $2,000."

          "description":"Craigslist and eBay are a few of the most common places to list high-end furniture, although there are other sites you can use as well. Chairish is a site specifically for listing high-end furniture, but you could also try sites like OfferUp, Bonanza, Facebook Marketplace, ArtDeco, 1dibs, or Oodle. These sites all allow you to include an advertisement and accompanying photos. They are accessible to buyers outside of your community. Shipping costs can be an issue when selling outside of your community. Be aware of the costs and make sure the buyer is willing to pay to come retrieve the furniture. Many listing sites ask you to pay a small fee, such as $1, to advertise. Depending on the service, you may also have to offer a commission, which is usually a percentage of the final sales price."

Many of them don\u2019t ask for a listing fee when you first post your advertisement. Be sure to read the fine print. Some apps take a percentage commission of the final sales price. It can often be a high amount, like 25%."

          "headline":"Offer furniture to a consignment shop if you\u2019re selling within your community.",
          "description":"Look for a consignment shop that carries high-end and vintage furniture. You will have to transport the furniture to the shop, but you can then leave it on display there. Then, you wait until someone buys the furniture. It\u2019s a great way to advertise high-end pieces in your community without having to do a lot of extra legwork. Consignment shops take a commission once your item sells. The fee can be anywhere from 25% to over 50%, so discuss the arrangement with the shop before doing business with them. Some shops force you to discount or take back items if they don\u2019t sell within a certain time period. Consignment shops are often small and have limited space, which means your furniture is more visible. However, the shop may not get a lot of foot traffic or customers interested in costly furniture."

          "headline":"Place a newspaper advertisement to get more direct community interest.",
          "description":"If you\u2019re interested in selling the furniture on your own, ask your local newspaper publisher about posting a classified ad. The ad gives you some room to post a brief description of the furniture and possibly a picture as well. Include your phone number or email address so buyers know how to reach you. If your ad is clear and an interested buyer happens to see it, then you can sell the furniture without having to travel very far. One downside of newspapers is that not everyone reads them. The only people that see your ad will be readers inside your community, and they may not be interested in what you\u2019re selling. Discuss the cost you have to pay to run the ad. It can get expensive. Newspapers often charge a fixed cost, such as $5 to $100 per line. Many newspaper outlets also post classified ads on their websites, although you may need to pay a separate fee for it."

          "description":"Search online for stores and traveling dealers in your area. Send them a description and photos of your furniture. If they like what they see, they may buy it from you right away. Most dealers also handle shipping on their own, too. Dealers are resellers, so don\u2019t expect to get the best deal. Since they are in business, they are often trustworthy, reliable buyers, however. Completing a sale depends on what the dealer is looking for and the quality of the furniture. If it all works out, then you can make a quick sale with a professional. If a dealer isn\u2019t interested in your furniture, they may be able to give you a free estimate on what they think it is actually worth."

Take it to a shop or auction house that has a history of  selling antique furniture. These places often have their own evaluators you can rely on to come up with a sales price. Many of them will buy the furniture from you or  at least link you to potential customers. Get information on how to sell antiques by getting in touch with antique associations. Search for national antique organizations online to find their websites. Antiques can still be sold through online listings and other routes, but they are more difficult to price and advertise accurately. You may need a professional opinion to figure out where the furniture came from, for example."

For instance, document markings, unusual features, and damaged spots. Display the furniture as accurately as possible so that potential buyers know what they are getting. Clean off the furniture and clear out nearby clutter. Make the pictures as good-looking as you can! If you\u2019re selling multiple pieces of furniture, separate them unless you\u2019re selling them as a set. For example, if you\u2019re selling a dining set, take a picture of the table and chairs together. Expect potential buyers to require a photo no matter how you advertise.
