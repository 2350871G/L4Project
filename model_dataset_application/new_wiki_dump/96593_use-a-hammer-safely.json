For example, if the head of the hammer is loose, it can fly off when swinging it. If you can, use a screwdriver to tighten the nails. If not, you may have to replace the hammer.

One side of the hammer is used to drive nails into wood, and the claw end of the hammer is used to remove nails. Use this to attach planks, hang artwork, or do other craftsman jobs. The claw section of the hammer is the back, pronged part. If you need to remove a nail, hold the hammer upside down, align the claw with the nail, and pull up with moderate pressure. As you do this, be mindful of flying objects. Claw hammers come in many different shapes, sizes, and weights. Some also come in solid metal varieties."

Wooden mallets are used to chisel wood or work on the fine detail of woodworking projects. Rubber mallets work well to deliver a strong blow without much bounce-back, which makes it great for working on furniture. The larger the mallet, the greater the swinging power. For example, use a small rubber mallet to hammer in tent stakes while camping. If you need to strike a hard object like a wrench or hammer, use a rubber or wooden mallet to do this. If you use another metal item to strike a metal object, it can result in injury."

Use these to shape metals such as rivets or to reach into small spaces. This hammer is commonly used by metalworkers. For example, if you are trying to reinforce a deck and can\u2019t fit your claw hammer into the crevice, try using a ball peen hammer instead.
