          "description":"Ceiling heights are more or less standard now, and most modern constructions, especially for individual homes are likely to feature ceilings at 10 feet distance from the floor. If you have a low ceiling of less than 8 feet, you need to choose a low profile ceiling fan, and maintain a distance of 7 feet from the floor to the ceiling. However if you have a high ceiling, say 9 feet and over, you may well require a down rod to ensure that the fan is not too high up to provide comfort. Determine the size of the rod based on the exact height of your ceiling. For a 9 ft ceiling, you may need a rod of 3 to 6 inches, for 10 ft ceiling, around 6 to 8 inches, and for 11 ft ceiling height, a rod of around 12 to 16 inches may be needed, depending on whether you also use an air conditioner, how many people are likely to be in the room at a given time, and so on. In both cases, you need to ensure a minimum distance of 18 inches from blade to wall."
