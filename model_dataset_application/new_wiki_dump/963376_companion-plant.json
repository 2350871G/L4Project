Pest control \u2013 some plants may discourage pests (e.g., marigolds) or protect plants that are normally attractive to these pests.

Pollination increase \u2013 some plants (e.g., sunflowers) attract pollinators, which can benefit other plants in their vicinity. Shelter or support \u2013 companion plants can serve to shelter or support other plants (e.g., by providing cover from the wind). Corn, for example, both shelters and supports other crops around it. Flavor improvement \u2013 some plants can improve the flavor of other plants simply by being in close proximity with one another. For instance, plating basil will improve the flavor of nearby tomatoes."
