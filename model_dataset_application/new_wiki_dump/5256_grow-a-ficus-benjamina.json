The best cutting will be a small sprig that's at least 6 inches (15 cm) long, and with a few leaves on it. You don't want the sprig to be a brand new shoot, but it also shouldn't be too old either. Look for a sprig with no damage and healthy, green leaves."

Make the cut just below a node, which is where a leaf grows out from the sprig. There will be more rooting hormone below the node, which will help to ensure a successful propagation. Be very careful with the sap that comes from the ficus. It can cause a rash if you get it on your skin."

You can leave one top leaf intact, but remove all other foliage so the plan can concentrate its energy on rooting. The cutting will quickly dry out and die if you don't remove most of the leaves, because the plant will put too much energy into keeping the leaves alive."

You want to add enough soil to cover the roots and stabilize the stem, but not so much soil that most of the stem will be covered.
