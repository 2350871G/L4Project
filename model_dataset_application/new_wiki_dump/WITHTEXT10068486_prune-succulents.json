          "description":"You will typically find dead leaves on the lower parts of your succulents. Remove these leaves gently with your fingers to help your plant grow. If you leave them on the stem for too long, the soil below the plant will take longer to dry, which can lead to rot. Keeping your plant free from dead leaves can also promote new growth on the stem (you might even notice some when you pull off the dead leaves)."

          "description":"Although succulents can be pruned at anytime, the beginning of the growing season is ideal due to the high level of growth. Near the end of the season, you probably won't see new growth as fast. Succulent growth periods vary, so be sure to double-check the growing season for your type. In general, flowering varieties should be bloomed after they bloom, or during the winter when they are dormant.

When you do water your plants, give them enough time dry afterwards. With the right pruning and a lot of indirect sunlight, you will only need to prune your succulents every few months to a year. Overwatering succulents can lead to root rot."
