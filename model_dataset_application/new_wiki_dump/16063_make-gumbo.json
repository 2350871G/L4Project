Discard the shells and reserve the seafood in a sealed container. Refrigerate it until you're ready to compile the gumbo. Making the Base Make a roux. Heat the butter in a stockpot large enough to hold the gumbo. Turn the burner to medium high and allow the butter to melt completely. Add the flour and use a whisk to stir it into the butter. Keep stirring as the mixture cooks and turns from gold to brown. Don't overcook the roux, or it will change the flavor of the gumbo. Turn down the heat if it looks like it's cooking too quickly. If the roux overcooks, it's best to start over with a new batch of butter and flour. Add the stock. As soon as the roux looks ready, ladle the stock to keep the roux from burning. Stir the mixture until the stock heats and begins to simmer. Add the vegetables. Stir in the onion, celery, and bell pepper mixture. Sprinkle in the chopped okra and garlic. Bring the stock to a boil. Brown the meat. While the stock is coming to a boil, place a skillet on a burner and turn the heat to medium high. Pour some oil on the skillet and let it heat up. Lay the bite-sized chunks of raw meat on the skillet and let them brown on one side for a minute. Use tongs to turn the meat over and brown it on the other side. Work in batches if necessary, since crowding the pan with meat will prevent liquid evaporation and prevent proper browning. It's not necessary to completely cook the meat, since it will finish in the gumbo pot. Add the meats and fish to the pot. Use tongs to transfer the browned meat to the pot. Add the smoked meats as well. Use a large wooden spoon to stir the mixture, and bring it back to a boil, then reduce it to a simmer and let it cook for one hour. Seasoning and Finishing the Gumbo Add the seasonings. Measure in the cayenne, black pepper, salt, and any other seasonings you wish to incorporate. Stir them into the gumbo. Taste the gumbo and decide whether to add more seasonings. Simmer the gumbo for another hour to give the flavors time to meld. Cook the rice. In a separate pot or in a rice cooker, cook the rice. When it's finished cooking, use two forks to fluff it up. Stir in the seafood. When the gumbo is almost finished cooking, stir in the shellfish and let it cook for another 10 minutes. This keeps the shellfish tender. Serve the gumbo. Spoon the rice into bowls. Ladle the gumbo over the rice and serve it hot. Many Cajuns enjoy gumbo with Louisiana hot sauce on the side.",
