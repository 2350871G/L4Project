  "text":" Start by drawing four rounded squares.  Draw on the rounded squares wave like lines, this lines will be representations of the surf meeting the shore on the beach.  Draw some pebbles on all four rounded squares. Make them round but imperfectly round and draw them in different kinds of sizes. The first beach animal is a starfish. Draw on the first rounded square a star, but make its pointy sides rounded. Erase also some inside lines inside your drawn star to make your artwork cleaner. Next, draw its details. Draw a smaller star inside our previously draw star and then draw five lines meeting in the middle of the stars. You have now a drawn representation of a starfish. The next beach animal is the shell of a snail. Copy the shape from the accompanied illustration for the shape of the shell. Don\u2019t forget to erase again some inside lines as instructed on step four. Draw a spiral shape inside the shell. Start from the middle of the shell and end the spiral on its right side. The third beach animal is a scallop shell. Create the shell by drawing a fan-like shape but make its edges into small curved lines and then draw two right triangles on both its sides. Draw the shell on the third rounded square and erase again inside lines. Add details on the shell by drawing 2 more curved lines copying its edges and then lines for its ridges.  Finally, the fourth beach animal to draw is a crab. Start drawing him by drawing first the shape of his body on the fourth rounded square. And then draw a claw and three legs on both its sides, its left and right side. End this step by drawing his tiny circle eyes. Outline your artwork. Use a thick black pen or marker to outline your rounded squares and then thinner pointed pen for your drawing. Clean it up by erasing pencil marks. You can now color it.
