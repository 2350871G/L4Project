If you already have units on the field, you can move or exchange them between rear-guard zones vertically, but not horizontally. This part is known as the Main Phase of your turn.

When you want to initiate a battle, turn the unit you want to use sideways so it\u2019s horizontal in its zone. The unit has to either be your vanguard or the other units in the front row of the field.

Your opponent must perform a damage check by taking the number of cards listed from the top of their deck and placing it in their trigger zone. If it has a symbol in the top right corner, your opponent chooses which cards are affected by the effects. Then, they place the card they drew in the top-most slot of the damage zone on their playmat. Activate any effects that occur during a damage check. If the card revealed during a damage check has an AUTO effect that occurs during the damage check, then the ability is activated before the card goes in the damage zone. After damage is dealt, play switches to your opponent. Turn the unit that attacked horizontal to rest it. Whenever a unit battles another unit, it cannot be used again during that turn. Turn the unit sideways so it\u2019s in the resting position. Rested cards can be used again after your next Stand phase. If an ability on a rested unit triggers, you can still use that ability. Continue playing until a player takes 6 damage or runs out of cards. Keep alternating turns and battling for the rest of the game. If you ever receive 6 or more damage in their damage zone, they lose. If you ever run out of cards in your deck and you\u2019re unable to draw at the start of your turn, you also lose. Boosting Your Power Place units in the guardian circle to add power to a unit that\u2019s being attacked. If you are attacked by an opponent\u2019s unit, you can use cards from your hand to help defend. Check on the left side of the card to see if it has a shield value. Play the card horizontally on the guardian circle and add the shield value to the power of the unit that\u2019s being attacked. You may also use any units in rear-guard circles that have the intercept skill below their grade.Tip: You can use any number of units to guard, but they are placed in the drop zone once the battle is over. Rest units with skill icons to get boosts during your turn. If you initiate battle, you can use a card with the Boost ability in the same column as the attacking unit. Look in the top left corner under the grade to see if it has a boost skill and turn the card sideways if you want to use it. Take the power from the unit you used to boost and add it to the power of the unit that\u2019s attacking. You can only boost power during your own turn. Activate a Stride ability to play a G unit from your G zone. If you and your opponent both have vanguards that are grade 3, you can choose to \u201cstride\u201d a card after your Ride Phase. Choose a card from the G zone at the top left of the playmat and place it on top of your vanguard. Add the power of the G unit and the vanguard underneath it together. G units are extremely powerful and can help you make a game-changing play during your match. When your turn is over, the G unit is placed back in the G zone face up. Units in your G zone are separate from your deck.",
