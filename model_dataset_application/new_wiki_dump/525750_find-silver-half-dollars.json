          "description":"Prior to 1965, half dollars contained 90% silver. In 1965, the U.S. Mint removed silver from all dimes and quarters. They also reduced the silver content in half dollars from 90% to 40%, which is the silver content for all half dollars minted for general circulation in the years 1965-1970. Most coins minted after 1970 are not made of silver but are most likely nickel-clad half dollars. Kennedy 1964 half dollars are the last 90% silver coins minted by the Federal Reserve for regular circulation. When you have find a half dollar, make sure its date matches the symbol minted during that period. For example, a Kennedy half dollar with a date before 1965 is a potential counterfeit, but only the most rare dates are actually counterfeited."

          "description":"Silver exhibits weak magnetic effects. If your coins stick to a magnet, they are most likely not silver. Your half dollar is more likely nickel-clad if it's strongly magnetic. Remember that some metals (like aluminum or titanium) can look like silver. When in doubt, bring your coin to a dealer who can determine its authenticity."

If you place a piece of ice directly on the silver and it melts immediately (as if it has been placed on a hot object), your coin is most likely silver. Avoid performing this test outdoors. The ice test will be most accurate in a room temperature area."

If it does not make this sound, the coin is likely a counterfeit. Be careful to only do this test if you are certain that the coin you are dropping isn't a rare date/mint mark combination. The ring test is likely to make a dent on the coin if it falls from a high place, and even seemingly minor damage can severely hurt a rare coin's value."
