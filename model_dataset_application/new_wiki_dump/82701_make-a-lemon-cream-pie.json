Pulse the food processor for about a minute, until the graham crackers have been crushed into coarse crumbs. Nine crackers will give you about 1\u00bd cups (128 g) of graham cracker crumbs. You can also crush the crackers in a bag if you don\u2019t have a food processor. Transfer the graham crackers to a sealable plastic bag. Seal the bag and roll over the crackers with a rolling pin until they're crushed to crumbs."
