You only need \u00bd cup (118 ml) of hot water to test the baking powder, but filling the kettle to the minimum fill line will ensure the heating element doesn\u2019t overheat. Turn on the kettle and bring the water to a boil. Don\u2019t use more water than you need, otherwise the kettle will waste energy heating the extra water."

Once the water has boiled, you'll pour it over the baking powder, so it\u2019s important to use a dish that can withstand the heat. You can actually use this same method to test the potency of baking soda as well."

To test baking soda instead of baking powder, add 1 teaspoon of white vinegar to the hot water before pouring it over the soda. The acid in the vinegar will react with the baking soda and activate it if it\u2019s still good."

Fizzing and hissing means the baking powder is fresh and can be used as a leavening agent in baking. The more bubbles the baking powder creates, the fresher it is."

When making baking powder with a liquid plus baking soda, reduce the amount of other liquids in the recipe by the same amount.
