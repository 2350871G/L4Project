          "description":"Before you do anything, flip the switch on your wall or tank to turn the electricity for your well pump off. The switch will either be installed on the wall near your tank or on the control unit itself. If you don\u2019t know where the electrical switch for the pump is, you can flip the breaker for the room that the well system is in. Turning the electricity off will hold the water supply from the source in place. This means that no new water will be fed into your tank. This will also prevent you from getting electrocuted if you have to touch the circuits in your control system. If you\u2019re using a submersible system, make sure that you close the water line manually first. There should be a valve near the location where the pipe turns downward into the ground."

          "description":"You need to shut off the water and drain your pressure tank in order to diagnose and resolve pressure-related issues in your well system. To start, screw a hose on to the water spigot near your control system. Run the hose to a safe area outside where you can empty a few dozen gallons of water. If you live in a residential area, you can run the hose out to the nearest gutter. If there is water dripping off of your spigot when you go to attach the hose, this could be your problem. Try tightening the valve on the spigot. If it\u2019s still dripping when it\u2019s tightly closed, replace it. This may solve minor pressure issues."

If you have one, it is between the tank and the pipe running the water into the building. Turn it so that it\u2019s not parallel to the pipe to turn it off.Tip: You may not have a shutoff valve depending on the brand of your well system. If you don\u2019t, it\u2019s not the end of the world. It will simply take longer to drain and resupply the pipes."

The well system will use the pressure already in the tank to push out the water. This should typically be done once every 6-8 months for maintenance. This process removes sediment and debris from your pipes."

          "description":"Pay attention to the gauge above your drain valve as the water empties out of the tank. The needle on the gauge should go down very slowly at first as the water initially drains. It should drop rapidly to 0 psi once the water passes the pressure sensor at the bottom of your tank. If the gauge doesn\u2019t respond, behaves erratically, or shoots up and down when you\u2019re draining the tank, contact a well-water system repair company. The problem is likely electrical and requires a licensed professional to fix it. Psi stands for pounds per square inch. It is the unit used to measure pressure. Once the pressure reads 0 psi, your tank is empty. Close the spigot once you\u2019ve drained it."

          "description":"Once your tank is at 0 psi and there is no more water coming out of the hose, your tank is empty. Inspect the top of the tank and you\u2019ll see 2 caps. The bigger one is the well cap, and the smaller one is the air fill valve. Unscrew the smaller cap by hand to access the air fill valve. Depending on your specific brand, the air fill valve may be on the side near the top. If the screw is screwed on too tight to remove, try using a wrench or channel locks to loosen it. The air fill valve is usually the smallest cap on the top of the tank. It is rarely in the center of the top though."

          "headline":"Attach a pressure gauge to the air valve and wait for the needle to stop moving.",
          "description":"Screw your pressure gauge on to the air fill valve. Tighten it by twisting it on to the threads of your air valve or clamping it on with the locking mechanism by flipping the switch on the gauge. Put your ear near the valve to make sure that there is no air escaping from the valve. Once the gauge is airtight on the valve, watch the needle on the pressure gauge and wait for it to adjust to the pressure on your tank. Tip: Well water systems use compressed air in the pressure tank to force water through the pipes in your building. When you check the pressure through the air fill valve without water in the tank, you\u2019re measuring the base pressure in the tank. If you hear air coming out of the air fill valve either before or after you take the cap off, your air fill valve may need to be replaced. This typically requires a professional to install it."

          "description":"Check the reading on your gauge to make sure that air in your empty tank is 1-10 psi below the cut-in pressure. You\u2019ve emptied the water in your tank, so the pressure should be a little lower than your normal cut-in pressure. If the psi in your tank is within this range, there is likely no problem in your tank. The most common cut-in/cut-out configurations for pressure tanks are 30/50 and 40/60. These numbers refer to the pressure level at which your pump adds or releases pressure in the tank."

Replace the entire pressure tank by contacting the company that installed it. If the gauge flutters all over the place, make sure that your air pressure gauge is working correctly. Try testing it on an inflated tire to ensure that it is working correctly. Unless you installed the tank yourself, this typically requires a professional installation."

Attach a bike pump or air compressor to the air fill valve and fill it up for 15-45 seconds. Check the pressure again with your gauge and continue adding air and checking the pressure until you\u2019re exactly 2 psi under the cut-in threshold. Never go over your cut-in pressure. This can create a dangerous scenario where there is too much pressure in the tank for the amount of water in it. If you add too much air, simply press lightly on the air fill valve from the side. If you hear air escaping, it\u2019s emptying. If it can\u2019t be pressed to the side, attach a compressor halfway until you hear the air shooting out.

If it cuts-off early, increase the cut-off by adjusting it on your pressure control switch.Warning: If the water pressure extends past the cut-off, turn your system off and call a well water repair specialist. High pressure in a water system can burst pipes and require expensive and difficult repairs. Open the water shutoff once you\u2019ve verified that your tank is cutting off automatically at the correct psi.

Tighten the nut as necessary until it reads no more than 2 psi under the cut-in. The pressure control switch sends the signal to the tank that it needs to turn on or off.

Many pressure boosters involve installing multiple valves and pressure gauges along your supply line to push water through at a faster rate. Some pressure boosters are all-in-one units, and replace a section of your control unit or regulator with a second pump system.
