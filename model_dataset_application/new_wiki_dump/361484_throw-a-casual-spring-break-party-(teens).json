Have people come to the location at about 6:30 PM (try to arrange it so that they arrive in groups), and let the party continue until around 1 AM. It seems late, but when you're having fun hanging out with people you know, time flies! But, with young teens (13-15 years) try to end it a little earlier, like 11:30 or 12:00, because your parents might object otherwise!"

People need to feel privileged to be invited, not pondering whether or not they were invited out of obligation or pity. Limit the guest list to close friends, people you want to get to know better, and people whose opinions could have an effect on your social standing at a later time. Don't invite people who don't like you or who don't like one of your closest friends. Invite girls and guys."

If someone does not have an email address, it's okay to go up to them by their locker and write down on a slip of paper the address, the occasion, and someone else they know who will be coming."

A somewhat scheduled time (i.e. \"somewhere between 9:00 and 10:30...\") for almost everyone to sit down in an open room with a big TV to watch a movie that everyone votes on. A drawing for two tickets to the first showing of a movie that's going to be a really big deal. During the earlier parts of the party, get someone you know  to contribute a game console to be set up in a living area for free use. At some point when it gets really dark, get a group of your friends to help you suggest a game of ManHunt."
