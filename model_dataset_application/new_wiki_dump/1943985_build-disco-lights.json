          "description":"The most iconic disco decoration is the disco ball. They produce moving white dots of light when a spotlight is projected on their surface. You can easily find a disco ball online, or make one of your own. Note that disco balls come in all sorts of sizes. If you\u2019re hoping to fill a living or dining room with moving white dots, get a ball that\u2019s about 12 in (30 cm) diameter. For a larger room, get a roughly 20 in (50 cm) disco ball."

          "headline":"Consider getting a disco ball motor.",
          "description":"The disco lighting effect is amplified if you mount the ball on a motor that rotates the ball and moves the dots of light around the room. You can purchase disco balls that come with a motor, or purchase the motor separately online. Be sure to get a motor that can handle the size and weight of your ball. Some motors are designed for small disco balls, while others can handle larger ones."
        },

          "headline":"Hang the motor from the ceiling.",
          "description":"Choose a location near the middle of the room that has a horizontal surface you can attach the motor too, such as the ceiling. If the motor is powered by a plug, plan the route that the cord will take. Most disco ball motors will mount to the ceiling with screws. Keep in mind that there will also be a light aimed at the disco ball, so there must also be an appropriate space to hang a light that will point at the ball."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Position one or two spotlights pointing at the disco ball.",
          "description":"There are specific lights designed for use with a disco ball, but many different spotlights will work. The important factor is that the light is focused, or pointed in a particular direction like a spotlight. The effect will be even better if you are able to point two spotlights at the ball from different directions. You can mount the spot lights in many different ways. If you get a spotlight specifically for this purpose, it may even attach to the disco ball's base. It may also have a base of its own that you attach to the ceiling separately. The ideal distance between the mirrored ball and the spotlight depends on the size of the ball, as well as the size and strength of the light. Experiment with positioning the spotlight in different locations relative to the ball and mount it where it provides the desired effect."

The openings of the cups will be tilted slightly away from one another, and the bottoms of the cups will point inwards. Continue adding cups in the same way, taking care to keep the cups on the same plane with one another. The specific numbers of cups you will use to complete this first circle is largely up to you. Keep in mind that you will be adding additional layers on top of this circle (with a few less cups each time) to complete a dome. If you\u2019re using classic water-cooler sized styrofoam cups, use 16 cups to complete your first circle."

Repeat this process with additional layers of cups. It will take fewer cups to complete each layer, until you wind up with a completed half dome. As you stack layers, the bottoms of each cup will tilt slightly more inwards towards the center of the dome that is slowly forming. It may be tricky to hold and glue the final few cups in the dome, so use clothespins to help hold the cups while you glue them in place. Make another dome in the same way. Together, these two hemispheres can be joined to complete the shell of your light."

If the LED string is powered by a plug, make sure to run the plug out between some of the cups."
