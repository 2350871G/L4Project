      "description":"Iron with the fusible on the back of the fabric (sticky side down.) Don't press forever as this is a two step process. The fusible, will adhere to the back of the fabric. You can draw shapes on the side of white paper, and then it will be stuck to the back of your fabric, You need to peel off the white paper and re-iron the shapes where you want them placed. Fabric shapes can be laid on the background and later sewn on to secure. Fabric layered on top with the edges sewn down by a single stitch is called raw edge applique. You can also try the zig-zag stitch on your machine or a running stitch if doing all hand work. Try laying down several layers. Remember that layering creates depth and shadowing. It is also possible to use scraps and leftover fabric for an abstract but interesting look. Sew two or three strips of fabric the same size of different solids, small and large prints, Iron each strip and cut them up and reassemble them. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/87\\/Lauren-3.jpg\\/460px-Lauren-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/87\\/Lauren-3.jpg\\/760px-Lauren-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":329,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":542.8571428571429,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"

Trim these to the length of the quilt. Have about 3/4 to one inch of extra fabric to tuck in at the top and bottom on the width of the binding. These should be neatly done corners. The binding colors should compliment the quilt.
