          "description":"Pour 4 cups (1 liter) of water and 2 tablespoons of anise seed into a saucepan. Bring the water to a boil over high heat. Remove it from heat once it's boiled and let it cool for 30 minutes. Pour the water through a fine sieve to strain out the anise seed. Stir in 2 to 4 drops of black food coloring and pour the mixture into an ice cube tray. Freeze the tray until the cubes harden. You may want to do this the night before you plan to make the cocktails. This will give the black licorice ice cubes plenty of time to freeze."

Heat the ingredients over medium heat until the syrup simmers and the sugar dissolves. Turn off the heat and let the rosemary-lemon syrup cool. Strain it through a fine sieve and throw away the rosemary and lemon peel. Chill the syrup until you're ready to make the cocktails. Save the fruit of the lemon for squeezing into the cocktail."

Fill it with ice and cover the shaker with the lid. Shake until the outside of the shaker becomes frosty. Ensure that the syrup is completely chilled before you add it to your cocktail shaker. This will prevent the syrup from melting the ice which could make your cocktails watery."

For an extra garnish, you can cut a black licorice stick in half and place one half in each cocktail."
