          "description":"If you\u2019re growing new begonias, you can \u201cforce\u201d them to bloom as soon as you plant them outside by starting them indoors. Begin growing your begonias from seeds, tubers, roots, or rhizomes in a container inside during the late winter. Once the weather warms up, transplant them into your garden to start enjoying blooms almost immediately. Wait until there\u2019s no danger of a late frost before you plant the begonia outdoors, since they are sensitive to extreme temperatures. You can find the expected last frost date by checking the Farmer\u2019s Almanac or your local weather station."

          "description":"Begonias need some light during the day to flourish and bloom, but they burn in full sunlight. To encourage healthy blooming, plant your begonias in a place where they will get filtered sunlight in the morning and be in the shade for most of the afternoon. Good options include the north or east side of your home, preferably under a tree that can help filter out some sun. If your begonias get too much shade, they\u2019ll still grow well, but they\u2019ll produce more leaves than flowers."

          "description":"Good soil conditions will help your begonias stay healthy and produce beautiful blooms. If you\u2019re planting the begonias in a garden bed, check that the soil drains well. For container-planted begonias, use a houseplant potting soil that retains some water without getting soggy. To test the drainage of your garden soil, dig a hole that\u2019s 12\u201318 inches (30\u201346 cm) deep and equally wide. Fill it with water and wait for it to drain. Ideally, it should take between 10 minutes and 1 hour for the water to drain completely."

          "description":"A balanced liquid fertilizer will help encourage your begonias to bloom. Dilute the fertilizer with water at a ratio of 3 parts water to 1 part fertilizer, then pour the solution around the base of the plant. Fertilize the begonias when you first plant them and then once every 3 weeks after that. Begonias grown in containers need to be fertilized more frequently. Fertilize them every 2 weeks or as often as recommended in the instructions on your fertilizer. Don\u2019t spray the fertilizer directly on the plant, or it could burn the leaves and flowers. You can also provide nutrients by adding compost or peat moss to your begonias\u2019 soil."

This will prevent your begonia from putting energy into making seeds and encourage it to make new flowers instead. You can also encourage blooming and healthy, bushy growth by pinching off the new tips of any branches you\u2019ve recently pruned."

Giving your begonias fertilizer with too much nitrogen in it, for example, will encourage them to grow more leaves than flowers. If you\u2019re growing your begonias in containers, check the label on your potting mix to find out if it already contains fertilizer, and if so, what kind."

          "description":"Begonias are sensitive to dramatic temperature changes. To protect your plants and prevent bud drop, bring your begonias indoors before the first hard frost. Cut the foliage back to some short stems, then let the root ball dry out in a cool, dry spot for a few weeks. Remove the remaining soil, stems, and roots, then pack the tuber away in dry peat for the winter. Store the tubers in a cool, dry, temperature-controlled area, such as a finished basement or pantry. When you\u2019re ready to start the plants again in late winter or early spring, put the tubers in some damp peat moss and keep them in a warm area. Plant them in pots once you see roots and shoots appearing. Wait on moving the tubers back outside until the last frost has passed."

To make sure your begonia is getting the right amount of water, check the soil at least every other day. Wait until the surface of the soil dries out before you water your plants again. The soil should never be allowed to dry out completely. Insert your finger into the soil 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) deep to make sure it\u2019s still moist below the surface."

If you notice that your flowers are looking ratty and chewed-on, keep an eye out for these common begonia pests. Use a natural pesticide, such as B.t. (a bacterial pesticide often sold as Dipel or Thuricide), neem oil, or pyrethrin.Tip: Another great way to control pests is to introduce garden-friendly pest eaters, such as praying mantises, ladybugs, and lacewings, to your garden. Depending on local laws and regulations, you may be able to purchase these beneficial insects online or from a local garden center. Always read the precautions and instructions on any pesticide before using or storing it. Even natural products may be toxic to humans or pets if you use them incorrectly."
