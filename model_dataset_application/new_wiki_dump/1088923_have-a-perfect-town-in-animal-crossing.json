Start at the top left (or top right) corner of your town and count 16 squares to the right. Put the pattern on the 16th square and on the one next to it to the right, which is the first square of the next acre. Knowing that that square is part of the acre, count 16 squares to the right again, and mark the 16th and the first in the next acre.
