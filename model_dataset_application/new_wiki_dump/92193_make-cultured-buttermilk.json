  "text":" Making Buttermilk With a Starter Add a bacterial starter of 6 to 8 ounces/180-235ml of active fresh cultured buttermilk to a clean quart jar. Use 6 ounces/180ml if you are certain of the freshness of the starter. When in doubt, use a full cup of buttermilk as starter. Fill the rest of the jar with fresh milk.  Screw the lid on securely. Shake thoroughly to mix. Label it with the date. Let it sit out in a warm part of the room until thickened, which should take about 24 hours. If you find it takes longer than 36 hours, the starter was no longer active (the bacteria had died). The buttermilk may or may not be tasty if it takes longer than 36 hours but it can still be used for baking. Check to make sure the thickened buttermilk coats the glass. This happens because the bacteria have fermented the milk, and the lactic acid is causing the milk proteins to thicken. Refrigerate immediately Making Buttermilk From Scratch Allow a cup of filtered fresh raw milk to sit covered at room temperature until it has thickened. This usually takes several days. Place 1/4 cup of the thickened milk in a pint-sized mason jar.  Add a cup of fresh milk (it doesn't have to be raw at this point), cover, shake to mix, and allow to sit at room temperature until thickened again.  Repeat this transfer of sub-culturing several more times until the milk dependably thickens in a 24-hour period.
