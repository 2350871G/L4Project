Talk to an employee about what flavors you\u2019re looking for and what sort of flavor combinations you\u2019re in the mood for. Don\u2019t forget to mention whether you\u2019re looking for a particular consistency as well. Be brave. You could always go for a solid cheese you\u2019ve had before, but trying something new will broaden the scope of flavors you\u2019re able to incorporate in future recipes. If you\u2019re looking for the meltiest of all cheeses, go for Muenster and Havarti."

For example, get some Comte, Taleggio, and Brie, all for use on one sandwich. This particular combination will go best with a fine, relatively neutral bread like Brioche. The important thing it to be creative. Plus, winding up with a few different blocks of cheese in your fridge gives you the opportunity to try other new, equally adventurous recipes."

          "description":"A high quality bread is an absolute necessity if you want your sandwich to look, feel, and taste gourmet. Most importantly, make sure the bread you choose is firm enough to provide a crisp outer layer when buttered and cooked. Go with Pullman bread for a soft and airy option similar to white bread, but with a better crust and higher quality ingredients. Rich, dense multigrain options can hold up to the most flavorful of cheeses. Pair it with Manchego. Pumpernickel can pair well more powerful flavors too. Day-old sourdough is the cr\u00e8me-de-la-cr\u00e8me of grilled cheese bread options. The air pockets in sourdough add texture to your bite, and a day gives it the necessary time to firm up and maximize crunchiness."

Include a liquid drizzle of dark chocolate and add another slice of multigrain. Heat as desired. Alternatively, pair Brie with apple slices and fig jam on multigrain. If you\u2019re looking for a particularly complex sandwich, throw in some arugula and caramelized onions as well. Want to keep it simple, add some class, and incorporate bacon? It can happen: pair brie with still-hot bacon and apricot preserves."

This recipe calls for sourdough, and will be best grilled. Alternatively, you can always cut up some fresh jalape\u00f1os. While your sandwich will still be both fancy and delicious, it will lose some of the balance brought by the jelly\u2019s sweetness."
