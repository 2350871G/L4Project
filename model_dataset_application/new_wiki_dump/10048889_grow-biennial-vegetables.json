If the plants flower during the first year, it is likely because they were exposed to frost. While waiting to plant, store the vegetable seeds in bags in a warm, dry location. In colder climates, you can get a head start by planting the seeds indoors, and then moving them outside when the weather improves. Check a grower\u2019s almanac to find out when the last frost typically occurs in your region."

If you live a very warm climate, look for partially shaded areas to prevent the new growth from drying out. If you aren\u2019t sure what kind of sunlight your specific vegetables require, check the tag or the seed packaging.

If dirt, mulch, or other materials are covering the top of the plant, it will become too moist and cause the plant to rot. Especially in the first year, make sure the top of each plant is clean. You can keep the plants clean by brushing them with your hand or spraying them with a light mist of water on a sunny day. This will remove dirt and mulch, and the water will evaporate. If you have a rotting plant, dig it up and remove it from the garden immediately to protect the other plants."
