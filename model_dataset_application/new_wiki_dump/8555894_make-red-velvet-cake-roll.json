  "text":" Baking the Cake Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C).  Prepare your pan and towel. Coat a 10 by 15-inch (25 by 38-centimeter) jelly roll pan with cooking spray. Line it with wax paper, then coat it with more cooking spray. Set down a thin towel (ie: tea towel) on a flat surface, then sprinkle it liberally with powdered sugar.

It is ready when the cake springs back then you lightly touch the center. You can also insert a toothpick into the middle; if it comes out clean, the cake is done. Do not wait for the cake to cool. Rolling the Cake Invert the warm cake onto the towel. Run a blunt knife around the inside edges of the pan first to loosen the cake. Then, flip the pan over the prepared towel. Make sure that the pan is oriented the same way as the towel. Again, do not wait for the cake to cool. You want to invert it onto the towel while it is still warm. This will make it easier to roll and keep it from breaking. Peel away the wax paper. Lift the pan off of the towel so that the cake remains. If the wax paper is still stuck to the cake, carefully peel it away. Work quickly; you want the cake to still be warm for this process. Roll the cake up. Fold the edge of the towel over one of the cake's narrow ends. Slowly roll the cake up, along with the towel, to the other end. Set the cake aside so that it can finish cooling. You want the cake to be completely cool by the time you apply the frosting. If the cake is too warm, it will make the frosting. If you want to, you can place the cake into the fridge to help it cool faster. If you cooled the cake in the fridge, let it sit on the counter for a few minutes while you prepare the frosting so that it comes down to room temperature. Frosting the Cake Cream the cream cheese and butter. Place the cream cheese and butter into a bowl. Beat them together using an electric handheld mixer until they blend together and turn smooth. If you do not own a handheld mixer, you can use an electric mixer or a food processor fitted with whisks instead. Mix in the powdered sugar. Reduce the speed to low. Add in the powdered sugar bit by bit, until everything is mixed together. Start with 2 cups (250 grams), then add more as needed. The frosting should be thick and creamy. If the frosting is too thin, add more powdered sugar. Unroll the cake on a flat surface. Once the cake is cool to the touch, set it down on a flat surface. Carefully unroll the cake. The edges will curl up naturally, which is fine. Do not attempt to flatten them out. Do not attempt to frost the cake if it is still warm, or the frosting will melt. Spread the frosting over the cake. Use a cake decorating spatula or a rubber spatula to evenly spread the frosting across the top of the cake. Be sure to cover the cake from edge-to-edge, corner-to-corner. You want a nice, thick layer of frosting. Roll the cake back up. Start rolling at the end with the smaller or tighter curl. Avoid pressing down on the cake too hard, or the frosting will come out the sides. If the frosting does come out the sides, simply wipe it away with your spatula. Chill the cake in the fridge for about 20 to 60 minutes. This allows the frosting to firm up so that you can cut the cake. If the cake keeps unrolling, wrap it in a sheet of plastic wrap. Finished.
