          "description":"The longer it takes for water to make its way through the hose and into your pool, the warmer that water will be. While fifty feet of hose is generally sufficient, additional length means the water will have even more time to warm up. The added surface area of the hose collects more heat, as well. If you use a dark-colored hose, the water can get even warmer because dark colors absorb more solar energy. A black rubber hose is ideal and relatively inexpensive. You can also use a black garden irrigation pipe, because it\u2019s thin walls allow for a faster heat transfer. While it is inexpensive, it will also kink easily. Both of these are available in most home supply stores."

          "description":"When filling your pool, make sure the hose gets full sun exposure to absorb as much energy as possible. Point the hose directly towards the sun or mount your hose on a board that can be angled toward the sun for even more exposure. You may want to consider mounting the hose on a board and attach it to a sun-facing roof. This is not recommended unless you have a suitable low roof, such a shed, or are skilled at working at roof height."

Try keeping the stream around half an inch in diameter to allow it to take in heat while still filling the pool at a decent rate. Always fill up your pool on a sunny day to take the most advantage of the sun\u2019s energy."

These covers can help increase water temperature by about 5\u00b0F for every 12 hours of coverage. Solar blankets also insulate the surface of your pool, which prevents the heat from escaping. A transparent or nearly transparent solar blanket works best. Just like a regular pool cover, solar blankets also minimize water evaporation, which conserves energy. They also prevent debris from getting into your pool and minimize the amount of chemicals needed to treat the water."

A ring is generally 59 inches in diameter, so buy enough rings to cover approximately 80% of your pool. Rings will generally last five years and cost up to twenty dollars each. However, considering that they don\u2019t use any electricity, this is a moderate cost. Another advantage of solar rings is that they are easy to remove and disassemble for winter storage. Rings can be left on your pool while the cover is being used."

The unglazed panels are less expensive but also slightly less effective in producing heat. However, the unglazed versions are efficient as long as you don\u2019t want to use your pool when temperatures are below freezing. If you live in a warm, sunny climate, these panels are an ideal solution."

Water is pumped through the filter and then through the collector, which heats it before returning it to the pool. They are an excellent solution, but expensive. A solar heating system will cost between $3,000 and $4,000 to buy and install. The system should last up to seven years. They are generally more effective than gas and heat pump heaters. They tend last longer, too."
