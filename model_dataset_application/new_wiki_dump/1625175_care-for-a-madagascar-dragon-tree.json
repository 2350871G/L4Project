Label the bag with the plant\u2019s name and date you sowed the seeds. Check the soil every day or so to make sure it\u2019s still moist. If it\u2019s dried out, re-moisten it. Wait 30-40 days for germination. If germination is successful, it should occur in about a month. Once the seedlings are large enough to handle, you can gently move them into their own little pots filled with moistened potting soil. Continue to keep them inside until the leaves have sprouted and hardened a bit.",
