Insert the knife at a 45-degree downward and inward angle to cut around and under the stem. Cut all the way around the stem at this angle, and then pull out the stem. Always be very careful when using sharp knives, and never cut toward your body."

Bake the seeds at 325 \u00b0F (163 \u00b0C) for about 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. Allow the seeds to cool, and enjoy as a snack, on salads, or in baked goods."
