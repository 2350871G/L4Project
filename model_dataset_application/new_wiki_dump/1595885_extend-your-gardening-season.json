          "description":"If this is your first year gardening in the space, walk around the area and pay attention to things that will impact growing conditions. Being aware of temperature, wind, and sunlight differences across your garden will help you choose plants that will thrive in different conditions. To understand your microclimate, consider:\nHow rainwater flows or settles across areas of your yard and how well-draining the soil is. If there are shelters, walls, or hedges that provide shade from above or trap heat by closing off the space. How much sunlight or shade spaces get throughout the day so you can arrange plants based on their ideal light conditions."

          "description":"If your garden gets a lot of strong wind that damages the plants or slows their growth, reduce the wind speed. You can install a fence or garden wall to protect plants. If you prefer, plant a row of sturdy trees or shrubs to act as a windbreak. Keep in mind that you still want air to move and circulate around the plants, so avoid completely blocking off your plants."

          "headline":"Set up raised beds.",
          "description":"To cut back on weeds and warm the soil in your garden, build raised beds using stone, wood, or bricks. The raised beds will also encourage drainage and make it easier to adjust the nutrients in the soil. Leave walkways in between the raised beds so you can walk around. Raised beds should be at least 12 inches (0.30 m) deep. If you don't want permanent raised beds, you can simply mound up soil and tamp down walkways in between them."

          "description":"Make it easier to weed by putting in trellises for climbing plants such as peas, tomatoes, cucumbers, squash, and melons. The plants will grow up so you can plant other things near the base of the trellis. If the plants are starting to weigh down the vine, use stretchy supports like slings, Velcro, or twine to hold the heavy fruits or vegetables in place."

          "headline":"Amend the soil as needed.",
          "description":"Buy a soil sample testing kit from a lawn and garden center to learn about what nutrients your soil needs. You might need to adjust nitrogen, phosphorus, or potassium levels or adjust your garden soil's pH. If the soil drains poorly, you may need to grade or smooth it so it doesn't collect in puddles. Adding aged compost or manure will increase soil fertility."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Keep records of your garden's successes and challenges.",
          "description":"Write down what plants you grew and where you placed them in your garden. You should also write down which plants thrived and which ones struggled to grow. Continue to take detailed notes for several years so you can use the information when you plan your garden for the next season. For example, you might note that your tomatoes got too much sun against the wall where you planted them. Your notes could recommend planting them in a shadier spot or planting a shade tree nearby. Your notes might show that plants do better when you rotate them yearly because of soil nutrient needs and pest problems."

You can start some seeds 6 to 8 weeks before the last expected frost date for your region. Use a web search, gardening book, or Farmer's Almanac to learn the last frost date, usually around mid-May in colder climates. Once the soil has warmed, you can transplant the seedlings into the ground. Always check the seed package for specific information about how early to prepare the seedlings. Depending on the plant, you may need to transfer seedlings to larger containers while they're still indoors. Some plants will do best if they\u2019re directly sown into outdoor soil.

You can also mix fast-growing plants along with slow-growing plants so you're constantly harvesting. Keep in mind that you may need to plant some seeds or seedlings later in the season if they grow quickly or are cool-season crops. Interplanting will maximize your garden's output and prevent weeds from flourishing because the soil is constantly being used. Some plants produce more with certain neighbors and some will do poorly next to others. Research companion plants before mixing plants."
