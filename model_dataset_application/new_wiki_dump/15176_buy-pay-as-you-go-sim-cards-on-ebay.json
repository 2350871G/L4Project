To avoid checking every listing, simply click \"Customize my Search Results\" and make the \"Postage\" column appear alongside the actual price, that way when browsing results you can see the postage costs as well."

Then, you can choose to sort from low to high priced items. This way you're seeing the cheapest items that can be bought literally within the next few seconds (no waiting for auctions to end).
