Leaking honey will cause a mess and can allow bacteria to get into the container and spoil the honey. If there is any damage to the jar transfer the honey to a clean glass container. Honey can absorb moisture and odors so it is important to use a clean jar to avoid unwanted smells or contaminants. Secure the lid tightly to preserve the quality of the honey."

Choose a storage location within the temperature range that is not prone to temperature changes. Kitchen cupboards, wardrobes and basements are good storage options.

Select a container that allows room for the honey to expand, you will need to leave at least one inch of room between the honey and the top of the container. Place the container of honey into a resealable freezer-safe storage bag, this will prevent the honey from absorbing smells from the freezer and will contain any honey leaks. If you have brought your honey in a pre-packaged container you may need to remove some of the honey to allow room for it to expand when it freezes. Pour the honey into the container and wipe any honey residue from the outside of the container using warm water. Storing honey in ice cube trays allows you to defrost small amounts of honey at a time. Pour the honey into the ice cube tray, use a funnel if necessary. Place the tray in a freezer-safe bag before transferring into the freezer."

If your kitchen cupboards are too warm to store your honey, choose a cooler room instead of using the fridge."

The granules will return eventually, simply repeat the heating process each time to remove the granules."
