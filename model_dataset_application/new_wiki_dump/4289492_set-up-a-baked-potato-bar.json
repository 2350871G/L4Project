Ensure all dirt particles and roots are removed. Lightly brush olive oil around each potato.  Insert fork holes in the potatoes. Slightly prick the prongs around each potato. Bake the potatoes.

Setting Up the Bar Group similar ingredients together in alignment with how the diner would prepare the baked potato. This arrangement is basically a uniform guideline to be followed for most buffets. Place the potato basket or holder next to the plates.  Go from left to right, according to where the potatoes are. The basic seasonings and herbs, such as salt and chives, should always be first. Cheeses and other light ingredients should follow next. Meats and vegetables should go last. This is to allow guests to decide if they want the food on the potato or on the side. Add utensils to all toppings. Insert spoons or tongs in each bowl or platter.
