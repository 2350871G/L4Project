  "text":" Making the minion base Find a square carton or box that you can use as a base for the minion shape. A cardboard carton used for drinks in any size would be perfect, but you could use other box types, tubes or containers, as long as whatever you pick is not too heavy and it has the basic shape of a minion. Cover the entire box with a few layers of ripped newspaper pieces. Use papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 glue to attach the newspaper pieces with. (The glue recipe can be found here). Add at least two, or maybe more, layers to ensure a good coverage. Ensure that the layers are smooth and even. Allow to dry fully between each layer. Painting the minion Paint the minion.
