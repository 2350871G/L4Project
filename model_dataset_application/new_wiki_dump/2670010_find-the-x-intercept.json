The y-axis is the vertical line (the line that goes up and down). It is important to look at the x-axis when locating the x-intercept. Find the point where the line crosses the x-axis. The x-intercept is this point. If you are asked to find the x-intercept based on the graph, the point will likely be exact (for example, at point 4). Usually, however, you will have to estimate using this method (for example, the point is somewhere between 4 and 5). Write the ordered pair for the x-intercept. An ordered pair is written in the form (x,y){\\displaystyle (x,y)} and gives you the coordinates for the point on the line. The first number of the pair is the point where the line crosses the x-axis (the x-intercept). The second number for will always be 0, since a point on the x-axis will never have a value for y. For example, if a line crosses the x-axis at point 4, the ordered pair for the x-intercept is (4,0){\\displaystyle (4,0)}.

Using the Quadratic Formula Determine that the equation of the line is a quadratic equation. A quadratic equation is an equation that takes the form ax2+bx+c=0{\\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c=0}.
