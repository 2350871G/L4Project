You may also remove the cushions and check if it's along the seat area. The tag should have either an W, S, W/S, or X. If your couch is W or W/S, you can use water on it. If you don't see a tag, don't use water to clean your couch, as you may accidentally ruin your furniture. Water can easily damage microsuede. The most common code you'll see is S, which means you can only use solvent-based cleaners. W/S means you can use water or solvent-based cleaners, and X means you can\u2019t use either and have to vacuum the couch."
