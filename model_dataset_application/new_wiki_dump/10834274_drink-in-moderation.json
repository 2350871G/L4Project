When you find yourself craving an alcoholic beverage, stop and take a moment to assess your emotions: are you feeling anxious, tired, or worn down? Perhaps you\u2019re stressed or overwhelmed or sad. You could even be wanting to celebrate something great! There are lots of different reasons why people tend to over-drink. Sometimes people over-drink in social situations if they feel uncomfortable, or they may use alcohol to make an awkward or unhappy situation feel a little better. If your drinking is triggered by specific people or situations, take note of that. You may need to avoid those things in the future. If you know when you\u2019re triggered to consume more alcohol, you can create a plan to keep yourself on track and meet your moderation goals."
