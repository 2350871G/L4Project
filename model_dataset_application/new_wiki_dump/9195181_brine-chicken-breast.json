          "description":"A brine, at its most basic level, is nothing more than salt dissolved in water. Different people like different ratios of salt in water, but a good ratio to start with is four tablespoons (about 60 grams) of salt for each quart (0.95 liters) of water. Add the salt to hot water and stir it until it has dissolved completely. Generally, brines call for a coarse salt such as sea salt or kosher salt. Table salt will work, but you will need about a quarter less the amount of salt per quart. A quart is enough to brine about one and a half pounds (680 g) of chicken."

While your brine water is still warm, add about two tablespoons (30 g) of brown sugar to your brine, and stir until the sugar is fully dissolved."

A teaspoon (5 g) of black peppercorns, two to four peeled and smashed cloves of garlic, a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, and a bay leaf per quart of water will add some subtle flavor to your chicken."

For a sweet brine perfect for honey butter chicken, use the standard water to salt ratio. Instead of sugar, swap in an equal amount of honey. Season with whole peppercorns and fresh herbs such as thyme and rosemary to your liking. Add a spicy flavor to your brine. Make a spicy brine by adding two to three seeded jalapeno or habanero peppers and a dash of smoked paprika to your basic water, sugar, and salt brine, along with garlic cloves and peppercorns to taste. Brine your chicken using beer. If you are going to roast your chicken, make a standard brine but substitute one cup (237 ml) of stout beer in your solution.

This helps keep the chicken juicy and leaves a more mild flavor. Cooking Your Brined Chicken Grill chicken immediately out of the brine. Grilling brined chicken gives the meat a crispy outside and a tender, juicy inside. Cook your chicken on a medium high heat of 375 to 450\u00b0F (190 to 230\u00b0C) until the outside of your chicken is golden-brown and the inside is up to a temperature of 165\u00b0 Fahrenheit (75\u00b0 Celsius).
