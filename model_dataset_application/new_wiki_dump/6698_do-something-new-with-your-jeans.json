      "headline":"Add patches or appliques.",
      "description":"Pick the one that's right for you. Iron-on patches and appliques are faster to apply, and great if you don't have much experience sewing. Choose a location. Flat or simple designs are great for back pockets. Elaborate ones that have sequins or delicate embellishments fare better down the sides of the leg."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Bejewel with studs or crystals.",
      "description":"Craft stores sell a wide variety of kits that supply everything you'll need, including design idea booklets. Be safe when using hot glue applicators. If you've chosen to add crystals to your jeans, read the glue gun instructions carefully. Mark your studs beforehand. Attaching studs creates small holes in the fabric. Be certain where you want your studs before using the tools."

      "headline":"Embroider your jeans.",
      "description":"If you have experience sewing, add a few designs to the seams, belt loops or a pocket."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Created \"destroyed\" or \"distressed\" jeans.",
      "description":"\"Distress\" the denim with sandpaper. Sand down the jeans on the front thighs and knees. The courser the paper, the rougher the \"distress.\" \"Destroy\" your jeans by scraping at the knee until a little hole appears. If desired, make the hole bigger by ripping it open with your hands. Use a knife or your fingers to pull the strings out, so they hang down."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Use dye or bleach.",
      "description":"Faded jeans can be updated to a dark wash look by dying them a darker blue. Black jeans never go out of style. Strategically splashed bleach can add to the \"destroyed\" look."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Alter the fit using a sewing machine.",
      "description":"With careful pre-measuring, you can change boot cut to straight leg, straight leg to tapered, or even lower the rise."
