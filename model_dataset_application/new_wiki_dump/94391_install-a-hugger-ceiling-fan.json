  "text":" Pull the wires from inside the fan rated box straight down and give them a half to full twist over their entire length.  Pass the wires from the box through the opening punched in the fan mounting plate.  Secure the fan mounting plate to the fan rated box.  Locate the hook on the mounting plate, and hang the fan motor assembly on it by aligning it with one of the mounting holes on the fan motor's flange.  Connect the wires between the fan and box with a properly sized wirenut. If electrical tape is needed to keep the wirenut in place, the wrong size wirenut is being used. Place a lock washer / washer on each of the fan motor assembly mounting screws.  Inspect the flange of the fan motor assembly. Most have locations for (4) four screws to secure it to the mounting plate. Two (2) of these locations are usually just round holes, while the other two (2) are slotted holes. Note the slotted hole orientation. Install two (2) screws and washers into the threaded holes that will align with the slotted holes of the fan motor assembly flange. Turn them in only until the threaded end has just begin to protrude out of the back side. Slide the washers against the head of the screws.  Remove the fan motor assembly from the hanger. Secure it to the mounting plate by aligning the slotted holes of the fan motor assembly's flange with the two (2) screws installed previously in the sides of the mounting bracket.

Install the other two (2) screws and washers into the round holes of the fan motor assembly flange. Once the last screw has been started through the flange and into the mounting plate, it and the rest can be firmly tightened. Secure fan motor assembly cover to the motor.  Secure the fan blades to the brackets with screws or clips provided.  Install each blade assembly to the fan motor.  If using a light kit, install it and a light bulb. Secure the glass. If not using a light kit, put the cap on it. Snap on the pull chains if not using a remote or wall mounted controls, otherwise you may discard them. Turn light on (if any).
