When working in a flooded area, be sure to wear rubber boots, gloves, and a mask or respirator. Keep children and pets away from any standing flood water, as it is often contaminated. Place the pump at the lowest spot of the flooded floor. If the water is deep, you may need to lower the pump using a nylon rope. If dealing with a small amount of flooding, you may be able to use a wet-dry shop vacuum to remove the water. These often only hold 4\u20135 gallons (15.1\u201318.9 L), so you may find yourself emptying it often."
