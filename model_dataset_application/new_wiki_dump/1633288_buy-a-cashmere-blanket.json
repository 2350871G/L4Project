          "description":"Cashmere is a wool, but it's not just any wool. Cashmere is obtained from a goat of the same name, but only the soft, ultra-fine undercoat is used for textile manufacturing purposes. Because of the extreme environments these goats live in, their undercoat is especially valued for being a great insulator, its durability, and longevity. Cashmere is incredibly soft and lightweight. Good, expensive cashmere hairs will be between 3 to 4 centimeters long each. Cashmere fibers are so thin and lightweight that they weigh 10 times less than other kinds of wool."

          "description":"Large department stores and famous retailers have laboratories where they test all of the wool items they receive for authenticity and quality. Because of this, you can know that even before you perform your own test, someone in quality control has also already tested the fabric to be sure of its authenticity. Multiple checks, however, are a good thing, on the off-chance an inspector missed something. While it might seem tempting to buy locally while traveling in a foreign country where cashmere goods are produced to help support local people, there are also large profits to be made off of tricking an unknowledgeable consumer into buying inferior goods. If you're particularly dead-set in purchasing a particular blanket you've found at a small store or from a local merchant, you can check the quality of the cashmere by administering a few physical tests and evaluating the fabric."

          "description":"Although it's possible that you might find a good deal online, you will want to, if at all possible, go into a store and actually interact with the product in-person. Several of the best tests to determine the quality of the fibers used can only be done by hand. If you found a bargain online and are dead-set on making that purchase, try to find a local retailer carrying the exact same item; many department stores and home goods stores will carry similar if not identical stock in their stores."

You also don't want to see excessive amounts of light coming through the holes in the weave: a good blanket will be tightly knit, and the light-weighted quality will be an inherent property of the material itself."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Check for pilling.",
          "description":"Pilling is a process that happens over time due to abrasion. The fibers unravel, resulting in the balled up ends \"pilling\" on the surface of the fabric. Although fabrics made of short, man-made fibers like acrylic, nylon, and polyester are the worst culprits, wool can also pill. Pilling will not only ruin the soft, natural texture of your blanket and its thickness but, especially on knitted materials, it can also look unsightly. Longer fibers will pill less and are thus considered higher quality. Give the surface of the blanket a gentle rub with your hand; watch to see if any fibers start to roll up or shed off of the blanket. Avoid a product that indicates it will shed or pill a lot in the future."

          "headline":"Compare the texture with other wool.",
          "description":"Mohair, alpaca, angora, and camel are all other fine, luxury wools, but cashmere is still known to be the  softest. If you can, find another of these wool products in the store, or perhaps bring something homemade with of a soft wool, and compare the textures with your fingers. If the cashmere blanket is not softer, then that should bring into question the quality of the fibers."

        {
          "headline":"Check its elasticity.",
          "description":"A properly made blanket should not fall apart instantly: rather, it should feature a tight enough weave that it will spring back and retain its shape. See what happens when you tug on the blanket: does it start to lose its shape? If it's properly constructed, it should return more or less to its original appearance."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Burn it.",
          "description":"This is not a test that you can administer easily in your average store: trying to do so before you have purchased the item may get you into legal trouble, and doing it after you buy the item could invalidate your ability to return it. However, in situations where you might be trying to purchase an item as a tourist in a small village, you could ask to administer a burn test to a single fiber taken from the blanket you want to purchase by using a cigarette lighter. Watch to see how fast it lights on fire: oil-based products (typically used in man-made synthetic fibers) are particularly susceptible to fire. If the strand produces a strong, plasticity odor while or after having been burnt, this is a strong indicator that at least a percentage of the fibers are synthetic. After blowing out the fire on the end of the strand, look at the end to see if it has distorted into a ball shape, with a hard plastic feel. There will be no ash, and you will be unable to make the fiber crumble between your fingers. This is another indicator of synthetic fibers. If the fiber has a natural burnt smell after burning it, check it against the smell of a bit of burnt cotton fiber to be sure that they are not identical: wool and cotton produce distinct smells when burnt."

If you do not see a tag at all, or if the tag on the item is nothing but a sticker, or the tag's authenticity seems questionable (perhaps it is pinned on with a safety pin, or the tag is a large piece of paper with handwriting on it), reconsider making a purchase."

        {
          "headline":"Look at the price.",
          "description":"Cashmere is an expensive wool to produce because it costs companies so much to get it: for every two pounds of cashmere, which is enough wool to make around 3 sweaters, it costs companies about $100 on the supply end. So even before a company has to start factoring in the cost of labor, overhead, and a margin for profit, there's a high cost involved. The only way to cut that price is if the producer combines the cashmere fibers with another, cheaper fiber. If the price tag seems too good to be true, then it probably is. Depending on the brand and whether the blanket is 100% cashmere or a cashmere blend, the price will likely vary. For a 50/50 wool and cashmere blend blanket, you might pay between $112 and $200. A 100% cashmere throw could cost anywhere between $250 and $1200."

          "description":"The Textile or Wool Act and Rules require that products be labeled to show the exact fiber content with names and percentages by weight for each constituent fiber, with the exception of fibers that make up less than 5% of a product. This means that you should know exactly what you're getting when you make a purchase. If the price is not a mitigating factor, you will want to select a blanket that has a higher percentage of cashmere to other fibers, with 100% or All Cashmere being the ideal, and something like 95% Cashmere to 75% Cashmere being adequate."

          "description":"Some industry experts like to use the country of manufacture to determine what they buy. If a brand's goods originate in Japan or Europe, particularly Scotland and Italy which have long been considered the best of the best for spinning and knitting cashmere, that tends to be a good sign of quality. On the other hand, while China does turn out some items of decent quality, by and large their manufacturing for cashmere has only taken off in the last 30 or so years; they still lack the finesse of high-end luxury mills elsewhere."

          "description":"You'll want to see that the manufacturer's label of the blanket in question has the brand name of a large, recognizable company with a good reputation for quality cashmere. Banana Republic, J.Crew, Bloomingdale's, Macy's and Nordstroms are among the list of retailers that sell items at a price-point many people will find more affordable, but Saks 5th Avenue, Queen of Cashmere, and Loro Piana sell quality cashmere for a steeper price point."

          "headline":"Check the ply.",
          "description":"Ply refers to the number of threads of yarn twisted together to make a single strand. Because this twisting offsets the turns in the single bit of yarn, two-ply yarn or fabric is considered to be better than a single-ply. However, two-ply is the ideal: subsequent plies (3-ply and 4-ply) don't really add any extra quality, only extra potential for color and weight (in addition to an increased price). Unless you need the extra warmth a 4-ply blanket can offer, or you've fallen in love with its particular color and look, there's no reason you couldn't go with a cheaper 2-ply blanket."

          "headline":"Don't get confused by descriptors.",
          "description":"Some of the terminology thrown around can be confusing: a lot of people seem to want to refer to \"pashmina\" and \"cashmere\" interchangeably. However, this is misleading: \"pashmina\" simply refers to \"wool fabric,\" not specifically to cashmere. While a blanket could theoretically be 100% cashmere if it is made out of pashmina, that is not a guarantee--it could also be a cashmere blend, or not even cashmere at all. If you find a blanket, especially online, being sold for less than these prices and described as \"cashmere plush,\" or \"cashmere soft,\" take a careful look at the product description and customers' feedback: chances are it is not cashmere at all but a synthetic fiber."
