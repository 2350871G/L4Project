      "description":"Here you can choose your nickname and the mode of gameplay, and then start playing by pressing \u21b5 Enter on your keyboard. Here you can also see your achievements by moving the cursor to the right side of the screen. There are different modes of gameplay in diep.io. You can choose between:\nFFA, which involves \"free for all\" gameplay. Survival, which is  basically a 'battle royale' in which 10 tanks play against each other on a map that is slowly shrinking. 2 and 4 Team (TDM) options, which is played with teams. Domination, which is teams played with four giant tanks in the middle. Whichever team controls all of them first wins. Tag, in which 4 teams try to completely eliminate each other. Maze, which is FFA, but instead there are walls in the game that are randomly placed when the arena closes. This mode replaced Mothership mode in 2016. Sandbox. Here you can test out every tank you wish with godmode (Press G). This is singleplayer unless you join a party or someone joins yours."

      "headline":"Begin the game.",
      "description":"When you start, you will spawn somewhere as a level one tank. Move by using the arrow keys or WASD. In the middle is your tank, which you control. Below it is a green bar that shows how much health you have left (it only shows if you are damaged). In the upper righthand corner is the leaderboard. It shows the 10 tanks with the highest scores. In the lower righthand corner is the map, which will show where you and team bases are in the game. In the center in the lower part of the screen is your tank info. It says your nickname, score, level, and type of tank in use. In the lower lefthand corner is the tank stats, which will be explained further down. In the upper lefthand corner is the upgrades, which will be explained alongside tank stats."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Shoot by left-clicking on your mouse.",
      "description":"You can choose where to shoot by moving your mouse and aiming it at an object. There are three kinds of objects: squares, triangles, and pentagons. These objects give you points to level up. The shapes have 'health,' too. This will appear underneath each damaged shape and slowly recover over time. When the shape is destroyed, an 'exploding' effect will occur and you get points. Pressing E on your keyboard will activate auto-fire, which will make your tank automatically fire without you needing to manually fire. There are special shapes as well. In the central area of the map is the pentagon nest. Here you can find lots of pentagons and larger, stronger versions called 'alpha pentagons'. However, they are guarded by little pink triangles that bump into you and deal damage. Randomly, you might find a green shape. These are very rare. Destroying one gives you the 'Shiny!' award."

    {
      "headline":"Level up.",
      "description":"As you level up, you can choose out of these to upgrade: Health Regen, Max Health, Body Damage, Reload, and Movement Speed. Choose wisely; there are limited stats upgrades. Once you reach level fifteen, you can upgrade Your  tank. If you want to play the smasher branch of tanks, you'll have to wait for level 30 to upgrade to it. You can upgrade the stats by clicking on the '+' next to each stat, or using numbers 1-8. To plan ahead, you can also hold U and then select the stats that you want to upgrade in the future. The selected stats will automatically upgrade instead of prompting you first. Holding M and then selecting the stats will tell the game to max out that stat ASAP."

      "headline":"Avoid common pitfalls.",
      "description":"While losing is a part of games, you should follow these tips to avoid being killed too easily. Don't go near enemy tanks if they outnumber you. You can get killed pretty easily. Don't go near enemy bases (applies to team modes only). These bases have powerful drones that will chase and kill you until you go far enough away from the base. Don't get to close to bosses. These monster tanks can be killed, but doing so is very difficult. Don't, as a general rule, go for a \"balanced\" build, that is be a bullet tank or a ramming tank, don't upgrade health/damage and bullet stats equally. Don't ram into too many things without Max Health (stat 2) and Ram Damage (stat 3) somewhat upgraded. Even if you thoroughly follow these instructions, You will die many times. Try to have fun anyway!"

      "headline":"Know what types of tanks there are.",
      "description":"Bullet spammers, snipers, drone users, rammers, trappers and destroyers are the different kinds of builds you can create. Bullet spammers overwhelm you with a lot of bullets and are used with the pentashot, spreadshot, and octotank. Snipers can fire one fast and devastating bullet (rangers and stalkers) while drone users control little triangles or squares to attack you. Rammers deal damage by bumping into you and are boosters, fighters, or smashers. Destroyers can fire one huge and slow bullet that deals a lot of damage (annihilator, hybrid, rocketeer, skimmer) and annihilator is sometime used as a rammer because of the huge knockback. Trappers spawn differently shaped traps which deal a lot of damage if you walk into them."

      "description":"These are AI controlled tanks which have a lot of health and deal quite a bit of damage. They spawn in every gamemode besides Maze and won't attack players lower than level 15 unless provoked. The Guardian of the Pentagons is a large pink triangle which spawns a lot of little pink triangles that swarm you. The Fallen Booster tries to ram you. The Fallen Overlord will follow you with its drones. The Summoner has yellow square-shaped drones like the necromancer tank. The Defender places traps and can shoot you with its auto-turrets."
