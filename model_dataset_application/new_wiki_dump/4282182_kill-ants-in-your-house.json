          "description":"This is the most low-tech solution, but it will definitely kill an ant! However, even if you only see a single ant, you should always assume that there are many more in your home. Scout ants leave scent trails for other ants to follow, so even squashing every ant you see won\u2019t stop an infestation. To do that, you need to either track down the nest and eradicate it with insecticide, or place poison bait stations in your home so the scout ants carry the poison back to their nest."

          "description":"Add a single squirt of liquid dish soap to a spray bottle of tap water, then shake up the mixture before using it. When you spray an ant with the mixture, the soapy water interferes with the ant\u2019s respiratory system and suffocates it, usually within a minute or so. You can also use white vinegar in the same way. Keep the spray bottle handy, since you'll almost certainly see more ants until you eradicate the nest. Shake up the bottle each time before using it."

          "description":"Bug sprays that kill on contact typically interfere with an ant\u2019s respiratory system, meaning they kill in much the same way as soapy water or white vinegar. They\u2019ll probably kill even more quickly, but they also contain chemicals that you may be wary of spraying in your home. Especially if you have pets or kids at home, or if the ants are in your kitchen, you may want to use soapy water or your shoe to kill individual ants."

DE may kill any ant that walks over it, and will almost certainly kill any ant that eats it. DE is made up of the crushed, fossilized exoskeletons of tiny aquatic organisms. Its jagged texture can cause fatal injuries to ants that walk over it, and will essentially tear apart the insides of an ant that eats it. DE is considered safe for use around humans and pets. However, don\u2019t inhale the fine granules, as they can cause irritation to your breathing passages."

To determine the preference of the colony that\u2019s invading your house, add a squeeze of honey, a dollop of peanut butter, and 1-2 potato chips to a piece of cardboard. Place the cardboard in an area where you\u2019ve noticed ant traffic, and wait 1-2 days to see which food the ants are eating.

Designs vary by brand, but each individual bait station often looks like a tiny plastic igloo with 4 openings, stuck on top of a roughly 2 in (5.1 cm) square of plastic or cardboard. Alternatively, you can make your own bait stations by mixing up a paste from 12  fl oz (350 ml) of water, 0.5 c (120 g) of sugar, and 2 tbsp (30 g) of Borax, then spreading it on small pieces of cardboard.
