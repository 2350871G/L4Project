          "description":"You can find LED strips in home supply stores, electronic retailers, and various online companies. They come in either individual pieces or long rolls. Make sure the lights you select come with the required controller and A/C adapter, and select a roll long enough for your intended surfaces. LED strips costs anywhere between $10-40, depending on length. You can buy LED strips in lengths like 3.28 ft (1.00 m), 9.84 ft (3.00 m), 16.40 ft (5.00 m), 32.80 ft (10.00 m), and 49.21 ft (15.00 m). Use small pieces when illuminating smaller objects, like end tables or mirrors. Use long rolls for accenting larger objects, like your bed or door frame. Purchase color changing LEDs for extra fun. Many come in remote-controlled or automatic color changing options. You can also control the brightness, as most are fully dimmable."
