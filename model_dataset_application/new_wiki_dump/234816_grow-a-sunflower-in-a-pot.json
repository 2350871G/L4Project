Dwarf varieties are best-suited for container growing. Sunflower seeds are also sold in grocery and convenience stores, but these are for eating, not for growing. After being roasted, a sunflower seed won't sprout. If you already have a fully grown sunflower plant, put the seeds from the flower in an airtight container and keep them in the fridge. Try to plant the seeds as soon as possible. Older seeds may be harder to grow."

If you're shopping at a local nursery or garden center, you can also ask an associate for help. Single-stem sunflowers only grow one flower from one seed. If you want to keep sunflowers all summer, you'll have to replant every 10 to 14 days. However, single-stem varieties are pollen-less, so they won't drop pollen on your porch, furniture, or clothes. Branching sunflowers produce many flowers over the course of the season without having to be replanted. Branching sunflowers also have some of the more unusual colors, including burgundy and chocolate."

Generally, most dwarf sunflowers can be planted in a 12 to 16 in (30 to 41 cm) pot. Mammoth sunflowers need a container that holds at least 5 gallons (19 L). If you're repurposing a container that was previously used for something else, make sure it's clean and sterile. You may also have to make drainage holes in a repurposed container.

As long as you use high quality topsoil, you don't need to add any drainage material, such as sand or rocks, to the bottom of the container.

If your sunflowers are outside, cover them with netting or a paper bag to keep the birds from eating all your seeds. Generally, sunflower seeds that are black or gray with white stripes are edible. When the back of the flower head turns brown, the seeds are typically ready to harvest. Once dried, you can keep the seeds in an air-tight container at room temperature for up to 4 months.
