Sometimes waiters are too busy to realize when you need something. Wave your hand to get their attention.

Many times waiters must share their tips with other waitstaff such as busboys, runners or other servers. Remember that you are taking away from their tips, too.

Understand that writing a bad restaurant review has its consequences. Many times these reviews become part of the restaurant's permanent reputation. People may lose their jobs if the story is bad enough. Follow a restaurant critic\u2019s code of ethics. Many professional restaurant critics wait until they have visited a location multiple times before writing a review.
