          "description":"Cleansers that are too acidic can actually damage marble tile, which means you shouldn\u2019t use products with lemon, vinegar, or bleach on it. That\u2019s why a gentle, non-abrasive dish soap, which has a neutral pH, is the best option for cleaning marble. For the best results, mix approximately 8 ounces of warm water with one tablespoon of the soap in a spray bottle or other container. Shake the mixture well, so the two ingredients are mixed. Don\u2019t use an all-purpose cleanser on your tile unless it\u2019s specifically marked as safe for marble."

          "description":"If you\u2019re using the dish soap and water solution to clean marble tile on countertops, you can apply it directly from the spray bottle. For floors, use a soft mop to apply to the tile. Make sure not to apply too much of the solution to the marble, though -- the tile surface should be damp, but there shouldn\u2019t any pools of liquid. If there is any standing water on your marble tile, wipe it up as quickly as possible."

          "description":"After you\u2019ve applied the soap and water solution to your marble tile, you need to wipe down the surface to remove any dirt and debris. Use a hot, wet cloth to wipe down any tile on your countertops or a mop dampened with hot water for your floors. Next, take a soft, dry towel or mop to thoroughly dry and buff the tile. Make sure the cloth or mop that you\u2019re using to wipe off the soap isn\u2019t too wet. Wring the material out carefully to prevent too much water from sitting on the marble surface."

          "description":"If you have marble tile on your floor, you may sometimes need to remove dust, dirt, and other debris, such as crumbs or loose tile. However, while a vacuum may be the easiest way to clean up this type of mess, you\u2019re better off using a dust mop to clean the tile. Vacuum cleaners with worn wheels and metal attachments can easily scratch the tile surface. If you want to use a vacuum on marble tile, check the wheels to make sure that they\u2019re not scuffed or rough in any spots. Don\u2019t use metal attachments either."

Use a gentle household detergent on fresh stains and ammonia or mineral spirits on older, more stubborn stains. Dilute your chosen cleanser with warm water, and use a soft cloth to apply it to the stained area. Use a clean, damp cloth to wipe the cleanser off and a clean, dry towel to dry the marble.

Mix 12 percent hydrogen peroxide with several drops of ammonia, and apply it to the stained tile with a cloth. Use a clean, damp cloth to wipe the hydrogen peroxide off, and thoroughly dry the surface with a soft, clean towel. You should only use hydrogen peroxide to clean your marble tile if it is a light color. Hydrogen peroxide may bleach dark marble tile."

You can buy commercially-made poultice powder that you simply combine with water. Follow the instructions to mix the paste, and apply it generously to the stain. Allow it to sit for 1 to 2 days under plastic wrap before removing the plastic and letting it dry. You can then rinse the poultice away with distilled water and buff it dry with a clean, soft cloth. You can find poultice powder at your local hardware, home improvement, or stone supply store. When applying the poultice to the stain, the layer should be approximately \u00bc to \u00bd inch thick. Secure the plastic wrap over the poultice with painter\u2019s tape to ensure that it\u2019s airtight."

Acidic liquids, such as citrus juices, wine, coffee, and vinegar, are a particular danger to marble, but even a puddle of water that isn\u2019t cleaned up quickly can stain the tile. To avoid discolorations, wipe up any spills on the marble as soon as you see them. You can wipe up water with paper towel or a clean cloth, but if an acidic liquid spills on the tile, wipe it up and then clean the area with a cloth dampened with water and dish soap. Make sure to dry the surface thoroughly when you\u2019re done. If you have marble in your bathroom, remember to dry the tile after every shower and bath."

Use coasters and trivets on tiled countertops to keep any liquids or food that drip over the edge of a glass or pan from falling on the marble. On tile floors, place mats or throw rugs near doorways so you can wipe dirt and debris off your feet before walking across the marble. If you want to protect a marble tile floor from scratches, try placing rubber mats under metal furniture and accessories. It\u2019s also a good idea to place them under plants and flower pots."

          "description":"To protect your marble surface from stains and discoloration, it\u2019s important to apply a sealant approximately once a month. It forms a protective film over the marble so you have more time to wipe up spills and clean stains. You can purchase marble sealer at your local hardware, home improvement, or stone supply store. Follow the directions on the bottle, but you usually mist it on, allow it to soak in, and then wipe down the surface. Make sure to start with clean marble tile before applying the sealer. If you want extra protection, you can apply a second coat of sealer after the first one is completely dry."
