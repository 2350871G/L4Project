          "description":"One of the favored smoke sources for this type of photography is incense, because a single stick will burn for about 45 minutes, giving you plenty of time to snap a few perfect photographs. Instead of incense, you can also use a cigarette, candles, or any other smoke source available to you."

If you're using an incense stick, make sure the incense is perpendicular to the wall, with the tip facing directly away from the wall. Make sure you use a proper holder for the incense, or secure it in place by sticking it into a ball of playdough. If you're using a cigarette or candle instead, use an ashtray or candle holder to hold your smoke source."

          "description":"On the wall behind the table, hang up a large black cloth. You can pin it, tape it, or hang it on a string, but the important thing is that the cloth lies flat against the wall. This will be the background against which your smoke will be photographed, so you want the backdrop to be dark, flat, and smooth."

Take a halogen floodlight or a bright lamp and position it in front of the table, to the right or left of the incense. Think of the incense as the center of a clock and the wall as 12:00: place the lamp at 3 o\u2019clock or 9 o\u2019clock. If need be, place the lamp on a separate table so that you can aim it properly. Point the light directly at the smoke source. For incense or a cigarette, direct the light at the tip of the incense or cigarette. For a candle, point the light at the tip of the flame."

Aim the flash at the tip of the incense, and not at the background. Position the reflector opposite the flash, near the lamp. If you don\u2019t have a reflector, use a piece of white cardboard, Bristol board, or aluminum foil instead. Sync the radio trigger with your camera or attach the flash and camera with your cord."

Similarly, to make the smoke more visible and easier to photograph, close the doors, blinds, and turn off all additional lights in the room. Turning off the lights doesn\u2019t apply to the lamp or flash you\u2019ve set up for the photo shoot."

If you're using a tripod, set the camera on the tripod directly in front of the incense (at 6 o\u2019clock) and:\nSet the aperture to f/8 or f9, as this will ensure the camera is able to focus properly on all the smoke. Set the ISO to 100 to reduce visual noise. Set the white balance to either auto, shade, daylight, or tungsten. Take a few shots with each and see which one you prefer.

Once you\u2019ve taken some shots, you can use air and movement to change the shape and direction of the smoke if you're looking for a particular effect.
