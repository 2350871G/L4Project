      "description":"This design consists of 3 parts: the existing pergola poles, the steps of the cat ladder, and the trellises (shaped like ice popsicles). The cat ladder steps are attached to the pergola poles. The trellises are attached to the steps. The plant container in between the pergola poles was built separately and is not connected to the poles. It is a box that is simply pushed in between the poles."

      "description":"The base of the cat ladder step design is the hardwood beam which will be screwed into the pergola posts and provide strength. Saw the beam to the appropriate length depending on how much space you want between the trellis and the wall/pergola post. You need to take into account a minimum width so your cat can actually fit there. 25 centimeter (9.8 in) is about the minimum size. Saw the garden plank that will serve as the plateau to size. Screw it to the hardwood beam with two screws making sure that the trellis-end is perfectly level. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/a0\\/Steps2a.jpg\\/460px-Steps2a.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/a0\\/Steps2a.jpg\\/760px-Steps2a.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":259,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":428.02197802197804,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>Image by: Uploader<br>\\nLicense: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}. Measure the width of your trellis. Divide this by half and deduct half of the width of the pergola pole. This is the size of the small wooden batten that will go at the trellis end. It is best to dry-fit to make sure. Screw the wooden batten in place with one screw in the hardwood beam and one screw in the plateau plank. Pre-drill as appropriate. In this design, the garden wood planks were not wide enough to cover the width of the trellis and the wooden battens were therefore a necessity. Your design might not need them. A cat ladder step that goes on the right has a mirrored design to one that goes on the left."

      "description":"It's trellis time! Measure how far up you want your trellis to go (all the way up is recommended). Your trellises will probably not be long enough, so you will need to put them on stilts. Measure how much extra length you need and saw a hardwood beam to size. Use a connector plate at the back and screw the beam to the trellis. Screw in a few extra screws from the top if needed. Important note: The \"ice popsicle\" will feel rather flimsy. The pole it is supposed to rest on might wobble a bit. That's fine at this stage. Later on, when everything is put together, it will be very strong. This trellis was stained with a dark wood stain. This is not needed, but makes it look a bit better and will help hide the attachments needed later on."

      "description":"Time to build the cat stairway to the sky! Measure where the cat steps go on the pergola poles. About 45 centimeter (18 in) between every step works fine, but you can deviate. Plan the steps left, right, left etc. all the way up. Attach the steps to the pergola posts with screws. There are several ways to do this, but here is a method where you don't really have to measure very much beforehand and still get very good results:\nTake the cat ladder step you already made. Place it against the pole where you want it. Drill the first hole through the hardwood beam of the step into the hardwood beam of the pergola post at the end that is furthest away from you (the end that is nearest to the wall). Attach the cat ladder step with a screw but do not tighten it all the way yet. Just enough so it is stuck but you can still move it. Adjust the cat ladder step until it is nice and level. You can move it up and down a bit because there is only one screw attached. Use a spirit level if needed. Drill a second hole next to the first one. Attach using a screw and tighten both screws completely. Even though this is a strong connection, there might still bit a little bit of give. Don't worry about it. It will be very strong when finished."
