Special Attack controls the strength of special attacks, like Ice Beam or Thunder Shock. Special Defense is like normal Defense, except against Special Attacks.

Pok\u00e9mon with higher speed get the first turn in battle, which can be very crucial. In battle, a Pok\u00e9mon's moves have a chance of hitting the opponent. A Pok\u00e9mon even has a chance of doing double damage with an attack, called a critical hit. Each attack has a Power Point usage count. This count determines how many times a Pok\u00e9mon can use the attack. Attacks like Tackle have a high PP count, of 35. Stronger attacks, like Thunder, have a PP count of only 10. Make sure that you balance moves by choosing attacks that are efficient; Thunder is powerful, but you can only use it 10 times, and it is inaccurate. Thunderbolt is weaker, but you can use it 15 times, and it is very accurate.Remember if your Pok\u00e9mon is out of power points for all moves, you start using a move called struggle Some types of moves are great against others (like water against fire); whereas certain moves are not very good against others (like fire against water)."
