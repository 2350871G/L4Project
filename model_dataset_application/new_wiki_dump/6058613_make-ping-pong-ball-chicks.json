    {
      "headline":"Make the beaks.",
      "description":"Cut long diamonds from the orange felt. You'll need one orange diamond one per bird. Fold in half to create a beak. Keep pinched with your fingers. Glue in place on the fold line/area on the ping pong ball. The triangle edges will stick forward to form the beak shape. Repeat for each chick you're making."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Create eyes.",
      "description":"Draw on eyes with the black Sharpie marker. You can also create eyes with eye stickers, but handmade ones are fast and easy to do, plus you have plenty of creative leeway to make the eye shapes any way you like (try anime style, for example), and with or without eyelashes too. Repeat for each chick you're making."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Make the wings for the chick.",
      "description":"For each bird being made, cut out two wings from the yellow felt. Cut the wings in a rounded way, not spiky or too textured. Keep the chick looking soft and cute! Glue the wings in place on the sides of the chick. Repeat for each chick you're making."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Shape legs from the wire.",
      "description":"At the end of each leg, shape the three \"toes.\" You'll need to play around with the balance a little, to be sure that the toes enable the chick to stand. When finished, glue the legs firmly in place. Allow to dry completely. Paint the legs completely using orange paint. Repeat for each chick you're making."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Display the finished chicks.",
      "description":"Place on a tabletop or in a basket. If used as a toy, do not give to children under 3, as the small parts are a safety hazard."
