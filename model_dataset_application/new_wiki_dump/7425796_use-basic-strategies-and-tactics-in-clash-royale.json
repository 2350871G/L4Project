You will then need win condition supports, or cards that cover your win conditions weaknesses to help then become stronger. Wait for ten elixir at the beginning of a match. This helps you so you can use elixir to support your push. If you put down a hog as soon as you have four elixir, this will be your downfall. The opponent might have skeleton army and shut down your hog since you didn't have enough elixir for arrows or zap."

Then, you should rush the other lane with hog, X-Bow, or Giant preferably. Giant is weak to inferno, so take minions or zap."

          "description":"Use less elixir to counter a troop than it cost to play it. For example, counter minion horde with arrows or P.E.K.K.A. with bats. Getting ahead in elixir lets you play more cards. Some cards are very good at getting positive elixir trade. These are inferno tower, knight, arrows, and tornado. Remember that you don't need to counter everything. You can let some goblins touch your tower so you will have more elixir for a game-winning push."

The wizard will also destroy any hordes your opponent places to counter it. However, a good opponent might have inferno tower for your giant and knight for your wizard. Next time, be sure to add some more troops to your push so this doesn't work. Have spells to support your push. Zap, freeze, and fireball are good examples."

High damage building targeting troops are the best like hog and balloon. The other person might be ready for this and score some positive elixir trades if you aren't careful."

Place your hog and if you're lucky, your opponent won't be ready. After your opponent places a card, it takes 4 more cards to get back to it.
