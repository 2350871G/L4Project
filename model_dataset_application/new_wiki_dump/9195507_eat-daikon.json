They range anywhere from 6 to 15 inches (15 to 38 cm) long, so choose one that's the right size for your recipe. If you're just topping a salad with it, pick a smaller daikon. For casseroles or stews, go with a larger one. Daikon can be purchased at Asian markets and grocery stores that offer a wide selection of produce."

You can leave the skin on if you want an extra punch of spicy flavor. If you don\u2019t have a vegetable peeler, you can use a knife and make shallow slices around the outside of the radish."
