  "text":" Opening a Combination Lock Recognize combination locks. Combination locks require that you input in a series of numbers in the correct order to open the lock. They usually feature dials with numbers from 0-60 or 100, and you need to spin the dial to get the lock to open. Find the combination. Usually, the combination is on a sticker or engraved in the back of the lock. If you cannot find the combination, you will not be able to open the lock unless you can figure out the numbers or break the lock. As an example, this tutorial will solve for the combination 5 - 45 - 20 Turn the dial clockwise 3 times. This \"resets\" the dial, allowing you to input your combination. Turn the dial clockwise to your first number. Line up the first number in your combination with the small arrow on the top of the lock. In this case, stop on 5. Turn the dial counter-clockwise back to your first number. Turn the dial one full rotation, returning to your first number. Make sure your turn -counter-clockwise. You will pass your second number while spinning, but this is intentional. For this example, you would return back to 5. Keep turning counter-clockwise to your second number. After making the first full rotation, keep turning the same direction until you reach your second number. Here you would turn all the way to 45. Turn the dial clockwise to the final number. After landing on your second number, simply turn the dial to your last number, here 20. This completes your combination. Pull up on the U-shaped lock to open it. Once you've successfully input your combination the lock should easily come off. To review:\nSpin the dial 3 times clockwise, landing on your first number. Spin the dial counterclockwise 1 full rotation before landing on your second number. Spin the dial clockwise to your final number. Open the lock. Open multiple-dial locks by turning each dial individually. Some combination locks feature multiple dials with the numbers 0-9. To open one, simply turn each dial to create the correct combination. For example, if the combination is 1492, turn the first dial to 1, the second to 4, the third to 9, and the last to 2. The first number is almost always on the dial closest to the lock. Figuring out a Lost Combination Know that you can cut down the number of tries needed to guess a combination lock. A classic MasterLock has 64,000 possible combinations, but with a few simple tricks and a web-based algorithm you can crack the code in fewer than 8 guesses. Set the dial to 0. Start with the triangle pointing down to 0 on the dial. It does not matter which way you turn to get there. Put pressure on the lock as if you were trying to open it. Pull on the U-lock as if you had put in the right combination and wanted to open the lock. Turn the dial clockwise until it \"sticks.\" As you turn the dial, you'll reach a point where the dial gets stuck.
