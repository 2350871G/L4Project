Chemical grouting injects chemicals into the ground that fill cracks, secure loose soil, and repair the sinkhole.

This method injects a mixture of particles and chemicals into the ground to fill cracks, holes, and chemically seal the rock layer. It prevents any further degradation of the rocks that cause sinkholes. This service will be more expensive than just chemical grouting, but will make your home stable and prevent further sinkholes from forming over long periods of time."
