Rotate the handle to force the potato through the slicer. Different models may vary but should be used roughly in the same way. Use a mandolin or fry cutter that contains a slicer for curly fries.

To blanch, heat the oil on a medium-low setting. Add your fries and cook for approximately eight minutes. When the fries make a \u201cscreaming\u201d noise, they are ready to come out. The screeching is the sound of air whistling out of the inside as they cook. The fries shouldn\u2019t be browned, but will be edible. Upon removing, allow the fries to drain on a paper towel to remove excess oil. When deep frying, use a deep pot or wok with a thick bottom. Fill it halfway with vegetable oil and allow to heat completely before using. Frying can be made much easier with the use of a frying thermometer. This will allow you to control the temperature more accurately. When blanching, ideal oil temperature should be 250 degrees Fahrenheit (121 Celsius)."

Slice the potato into small spirals by carefully rotating the potato. Make sure the spirals are of same size so that they look good when you stretch them. Spread it out.
