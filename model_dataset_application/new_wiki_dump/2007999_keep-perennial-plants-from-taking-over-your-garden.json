Plant division helps keep perennials healthy, promotes blooming and  may extend the life of some plants. In the case of plants that are overtaking a garden, dividing a perennial will reduce the plant's size and keep it from crowding out other plants."

          "description":"Most perennials should be divided in the spring when new growth is less than 4 inches (10.16 cm) high. During the spring, the cool weather and moist soil keep root systems from drying out after being separated and replanted. Perennials divided during the spring have a growing season to recover from the stress caused by division, and have time to develop a strong root system to survive the winter. Divide oriental poppies, Siberian iris and peonies in the fall. Avoid dividing perennials during the summer, with the exception of the bearded iris, which can withstand the summer heat during plant division. Tough perennials like daylilies and hostas may be divided any time."
