          "description":"Use dark or milk chocolate if you are trying to get a nice jet black color. Otherwise, you will need to use white chocolate to make any other colored chocolate. Choose a white chocolate with a low viscosity, or that appears very thin when you melt it. Tollhouse's White Chocolate Chips are one of the better brands for coloring. Go for chips instead of bars, as the smaller the pieces of chocolate are, the faster they will melt."

          "headline":"Buy oil based coloring that is made especially to color chocolate.",
          "description":"Never add a water based food coloring to chocolate. It was cause the chocolate to seize, or turn lumpy and solid. You want to create colored chocolate that is smooth and easy to work with. So skip the cheap water based colors and go for oil or powder colors. You can buy oil based coloring and powder coloring online. One good brand is Americolor, which creates strong colors without having to add a lot of oil to the chocolate. If you are trying to create a pale color like light blue or yellow, go for oil based colors as you only have to add very little coloring to the white chocolate to get the color you want. If you are trying to create a more vibrant color, like a bright yellow or a bold red, buy a powder coloring or paste coloring. The more oil you add to the chocolate, the less smooth it will be. So using a small amount of powder coloring or paste coloring should create a vibrant color without adding too much oil to the chocolate."

The shortening will help the chocolate to set properly on your candy or on a cake pop. It will also speed up the melting time of the chocolate. Vegetable oil will only make the chocolate more loose and limp, meaning you will end up with messy chocolate covered candies or limp cake pops."

Melting the Chocolate in a Double Broiler Place a deep pot with a handle on the stove. Fill the pot about \u2153 of the way with water. Turn the burner to high heat so the water boils. Take a metal bowl and set it on the pot with water. The water should hover about half an inch below the metal bowl. Once the water boils in the pot, turn off the heat.

So when you add the oil to the chocolate, its important that the oil is the same temperature as the chocolate. This will prevent the chocolate from seizing, or turning lumpy and hard. Place the tightly sealed coloring oil in a small zip lock bag. Squeeze the bag to remove as much air as possible from the bag.
