The best way to do this is to ask everyone to RSVP, giving them a deadline to submit their response by. While it\u2019s still possible that the number of people attending will change whether they RSVP or not, this is still a super helpful way to estimate how much food to purchase. If you\u2019re catering someone else\u2019s event, ask them to set a deadline for people to RSVP so that you can get an accurate head count."

          "description":"Since a formal sit-down meal includes several different courses with pre-planned portions, you'll need to purchase more food for this kind of event than you would an informal gathering. Plan out the courses of your meal, if any, as well as any appetizers you'd like to serve. For example, a casual birthday party might have trays of appetizers or easy snacks to pick up, while a wedding reception would entail a sit-down dinner. Overall, people tend to only eat 1 serving of each food at a formal event like a sit-down meal, while more informal events where people can eat as much as they\u2019d like might cause people to go back for seconds."
