Dust and dirt can easily build up on a white rug and foot traction on stuck-in grit can actually wear a wool rug out. To minimize both dirt buildup and damage to your rug, vacuum the rug frequently on a low-suction setting and keep the brush roller turned off. Assess how much traffic your rug gets and stick to a vacuum routine:\nFor high traffic areas, vacuum your rug daily. For medium traffic areas, vacuum twice a week. For low traffic areas, vacuum once a week. Before you vacuum the top side of your rug, flip it over and vacuum the underside. Then flip it right-side-up and vacuum again. This will help loosen dirt and grime that has settled deep into the fibers."

Hire a professional carpet cleaner to take care of it, or clean it yourself if you have a steamer at home. A family of 4 with a white rug in a frequented area should deep clean every 6 months.

Dip a clean, white rag into alcohol and apply a small amount at a time. Blot and lightly rub the alcohol onto the rug stain.
