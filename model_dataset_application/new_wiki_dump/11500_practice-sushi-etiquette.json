          "description":"Some restaurants will place an oshibori in front of you when you sit down. It\u2019s a small, damp hand towel you can use to clean your fingers before, and during the meal. After wiping, fold it nicely, and place it back in its container. Use it again as needed. Don\u2019t wipe your face with the oishibori. It\u2019s meant for your hands."

          "headline":"Use your fingers, or chopsticks to pick up the sushi.",
          "description":"Even though most people use chopsticks, sushi is traditionally a finger food. Fingers make handling the roll easier, and allow you to feel its texture. This helps you prevent nigiri sushi from falling apart. If you\u2019re unsure, if you should use your fingers, or something else, ask the staff. Try not to ask for knives, and forks. Some restaurants are more forgiving than others about using utensils. Some people may also think you\u2019re a little rude for eating this way, so offer an apology first. Chirashizushi (scattered sushi) is best eaten with chopsticks, or a fork, if the establishment permits."

          "headline":"Lightly dip sushi in soy sauce.",
          "description":"Aim the fish portion of the sushi towards the soy. A gentle dip will give you all the soy you need. Rice quickly absorbs soy, which overwhelms the flavor of the sushi. Also, soaking sushi in soy is disrespectful, because it implies the original flavors of the roll are not good enough. Always dip nigirizushi upside down in the soy sauce, and eat it rice side up. Don\u2019t pour lots of soy sauce into your cup. You don\u2019t need a lot of soy, and wasted soy is frowned upon in Japan. Some rolls, usually eel and mackerel, already have sauce on them. Don\u2019t add soy, or other condiments. Wasabi isn\u2019t a necessity. You can place a little on your sushi before dipping it into soy for extra spice. Avoid mixing the wasabi into the soy sauce."

          "description":"Sushi is made to be eaten in one bite. Two bites is acceptable, particularly when eating large American versions. It\u2019s better to take small bites than to have too much food in your mouth. When you do this, don\u2019t put the sushi back on the plate. Keep the uneaten part between your chopsticks, and try to hold the ingredients together until you finish."

          "description":"Ginger does not go on the sushi. It is used after you finish a piece of sushi to clear off the taste. This helps you experience the full flavor of the next roll, or dish you sample. You do not need to eat a large slice of ginger to feel refreshed."

If there is no holder, rest them on a clean napkin, or lay them side by side across the bowl. The pointed ends should face to the left if you are right-handed, and to the right if you\u2019re left-handed. Don\u2019t cross your chopsticks. Crossed chopsticks is symbolic of death and funerals. Never stick your chopsticks upright in a bowl of rice. This also reflects a funeral rite."

Passing food from one set of chopsticks to another mimics this ritual, and is offensive. If you wish to pass food to another person, pass the plate to them so they can pick it up themselves. Passing sushi between chopsticks is only tolerated as a gesture of closeness between parents and children, or lovers."

Learning the basic terms beforehand can make ordering sushi less of a hassle. If you have questions, the chef, or the staff will be happy to help. When seated at a sushi bar, you may ask the chef directly. Otherwise, ask your server. Nigirizushi consists of a piece of fish, shellfish, or fish roe over a rice ball. It is the best choice for appreciating the flavor of the fish. Maki sushi is rice, and filling packed together, and wrapped in seaweed. Standard rolls are called norimaki, since nori means seaweed. Futomaki are thicker rolls, and hosomaki are thinner rolls. Uramakizushi means an inside out maki rolls. The seaweed is around the filling, and the rice is on the outside of the roll. Temakizushi are similar to maki rolls, but are shaped like cones. Oshizushi is sushi pressed into a rectangular shape. Chirashizushi means \u201cscattered sushi.\u201d Raw fish and vegetables are placed over a bed of rice. Inarizushi is wrapped with something other than nori seaweed, such as fried tofu. It typically is filled only with rice. Sashimi is raw, sliced fish. It is not actually sushi."

As long as you are polite, the itamae will be glad to guide you. If dining at a table away from the sushi counter, allow the waiter or waitress to speak to the chef. If you prefer to place your order with the chef personally, sit at the sushi counter."

When ordering multiple courses, start light. You won\u2019t fill up as fast, and will be better able to enjoy the taste of all the food. The chef may prepare the food in a certain order for you.
