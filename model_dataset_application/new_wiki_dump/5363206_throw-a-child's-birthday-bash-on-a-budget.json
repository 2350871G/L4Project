At the same time, you will have more money left in your wallet, no before and after party cleaning of your house, and a pretty low maintenance party where you can actually stand (or sit) back and watch the joy on your child's face. The park party has many benefits, including removing mess from your house, getting kids to let off steam and parents can hang around too, if they wish."

Sometimes you can get lucky and the pavilion won't be rented out and will be available for use, you just have to share with others if they wish to use any part of it.
