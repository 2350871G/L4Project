  "text":" Cork Garden Markers Collect corks from wine bottles as you drink them. Keep them in a drawer, sack or small container throughout the year, so that you will have enough to mark your plants when spring arrives. If you do not drink wine, then you can buy wine corks at a home brew/fermentation supply store. Create a list of all your herb plants. Gather enough wine corks for all of your herb plants. Keep a few extra corks on hand, in case you make a mistake. Take a fine-point black permanent marker and write the name of each herb on a cork. Other colors of marker will not show up as boldly on a cork. Ask someone with good or elaborate handwriting to write on your corks, if you do not like your own handwriting. You may want to write the name of the herb on both sides of the cork to make it easy to see from both sides. Find a small bit, approximately the size of a barbecue skewer, to put on a handheld drill. Place the cork on top of a surface instead of holding it in your hand while you drill. Drill approximately 1 inch (2.54 cm) deep into the center of the bottom of the cork. Make sure you drill from the bottom of the word toward the top. This will allow the writing to be read from left to right when it is in the garden. Place a wooden barbecue skewer into each wine cork. Push it into the cork firmly, until it feels very secure. Cut the barbecue skewers to a shorter length, if they are too long. You want to insert them securely into the soil, but they do not need to reach the bottom. Stone Herb Markers Find 2 to 5-inch (5.1 to 12.7 cm) flat stones. Make sure they are of a light color so that ink can easily show up on the surface. Find enough stones for all of your herbs. You will want to use 2-inch (5.1 cm) stones for herb pots and larger stones for garden-planted herbs. Clean the stones with liquid soap and warm water. Allow them to dry completely. Buy alphabet stamps and black permanent ink at a craft store. Practice using them to stamp the name of your herbs on a sheet of paper. You may need to experiment with how far apart you want the letters to be. Stamp each letter into ink and firmly stamp the letter onto the stone. Allow each stone to dry for an hour before placing it nearby your plant in a garden or pot. Spoon Garden Markers Take old spoons that you no longer use. Gather enough for each herb in your garden. If you do not have enough, go to a thrift store to procure inexpensive spoons. Wash your spoons. Allow them to dry completely. Peruse old magazines and cut out pictures of herbs or plants. If you do not want to use magazine images, you can write on a small piece of paper about the size of the inside of a spoon.
