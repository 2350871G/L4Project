Each character has their own advantages: Willow has a lighter and gains sanity from fire, Wolfgang gets stronger the higher his Hunger gauge is, Wendy can summon her dead sister\u2019s ghost to help her fight, WX-78 gets stronger from eating gears and getting hit by lightning, Wickerbottom can craft books with unusual effects like summoning Tentacles, and Woodie can chop wood faster and turn into a Werebeaver!

In RoG, another character named Wigfried is introduced, available when you survive a total of 96 days before dying, making her the last in the list.

He can grow a beard of Silk, making it easily renewable every few days, and he\u2019s immune to the penalties from eating Monster food. As a drawback though, his Sanity is quite low, and mobs like the Pigs and Bunnymen will attack him on sight since he looks too much like a Spider, which they tend to murder with extreme prejudice. You can still befriend them, but you need to feed them their respective items (meat for Pigs, carrots for Bunnymen) twice, once to dispel their hostility and the second to completely befriend them. Oddly enough, as long as you haven\u2019t buried Webber\u2019s skull yet, you can still get it as drops from Spiders and Spider Dens.

This includes player-only items such as Lucy the Axe, Willow\u2019s Lighter, and Abigail\u2019s Flower (carried by Wendy). Maxwell\u2019s Door is a huge metal and wood structure that looks like Maxwell\u2019s over-inflated head, and is surrounded by a field of Evil Flowers. To those who have seen the introductory animated scene of the game, it looks exactly like the object Wilson made under Maxwell\u2019s instructions.

The order of appearance for most worlds is chosen at random, however, in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th world, the map will show some of the path indicating where the objectives are. These five possible themes are quite difficult to survive in due to their unusual mechanics. You should at least make it a point to learn as many recipes as you can by making things on your Science Machine, Alchemy Engine, and Prestihatitator, and bring at least one warm article of clothing, since most of the possible chapters feature harsher winters than normal. At random, one basic resource will be made rare: saplings might not spawn but there might be spiky bushes instead, or there might not be any trees but only stumps. Common food sources like Carrots, Berry Bushes, and Rabbit Holes are also generally scarce in the Adventure Mode worlds, so you\u2019ll have to stockpile your food carefully and bring along long-lasting foods like Jerky and Popcorn. Thankfully, you always spawn close to a Divining Rod to aid you in search of the Things, which is the only advantage given to you by Maxwell."

Thankfully, you can equip your Divining Rod to direct you to the nearest Thing. The Ring Thing is a large yellow-colored metal ring and is found in the middle of a ring of Evil Flowers. The Crank Thing is a large rectangular metal object with what looks like large screws at each side and a small lever in the middle. It\u2019s found in a small patch of savannah, with Evil Flowers, a Pig House, 3 Spikey Trees, and an axe next to it. The Box Thing is a small wooden box and is found surrounded by Stone walls, a lawn gnome, a spear, and of course, Evil Flowers. The Metal Potato Thing looks like a huge round lump of scrap metal. It\u2019s right next to some Farm Plots, Grass, Twigs, and some Carrots, making it a good area to stay in for some food, if you need to. Lastly, the Wooden Thing is a large wooded circle with strange red symbols etched into it. It\u2019s also the most difficult to secure since it\u2019s spawned next to some hostile Clockwork monsters, and you can\u2019t move it either, so you can\u2019t just run and grab it. The entire area it\u2019s found in is full of Marble Trees and Marble Pillars, in an area commonly referred to as the Chess Biome due to it\u2019s checkered floor and chess-themed Clockwork monsters surrounding it. You can place any of the Things in any order on the Wooden Thing, and once it\u2019s complete, you can use it to get to the next world. The complete Wooden Thing is basically the Metal Potato Thing, now revealed to be a metal sculpture of Maxwell\u2019s head, floating on top of the other Things. It\u2019s also referred to as the Teleportato, as a reference to the Metal Potato Thing being Maxwell\u2019s head.

Of course, you start in the lush area but need to leave for the swampy area to progress. Normally, when the world is generated, the only way to the swamp island is a Sick Wormhole, which makes it a one-way trip, prompting the player to hoard and stockpile resources before heading to the other island.

Think of this as the Underground with exponentially less resources and more danger. Do not linger, keep moving forward, and you\u2019ll be able to get to the final area of Adventure Mode. The last area is named Epilogue. When you get to the very very end of Adventure Mode, you\u2019re immediately taken to this very special place, full of resources and darkness.

Do note that he is, by far, the absolute weakest character in the game, with the lowest overall stats, and is meant to be played by experienced players who want a challenge. Wes can be found in the third chapter of Adventure Mode (if it\u2019s not the Two Worlds theme) in a structure of three rooms, two with  Maxwell\u2019s Statues, and poor Wes trapped in the third one. If you break any of the statues, undamaged Clockwork monsters will appear to attack you, and you need to break all the statues and defeat all the monsters before you can approach Wes.

Maxwell\u2019s Lights are common, but the eternal darkness can still drain sanity. Even if there are some creatures you can kill and hunt for meat, they\u2019re not common enough for you to completely thrive off on. Think of this as the Underground with exponentially less resources and more danger. Do not linger, keep moving forward, and you\u2019ll be able to get to the final area of Adventure Mode. The last area is named Epilogue. When you get to the very very end of Adventure Mode, you\u2019re immediately taken to this very special place, full of resources and darkness. Any more description would reveal massive spoilers, but if you\u2019re not careful, you can still die from Hound Attacks and from the penalties of sanity loss. The only way to escape is to make a special choice, or to die. Find Wes! Here\u2019s the first \u201cspecial conditions\u201d character you might encounter in the game, if you haven\u2019t found Webber yet. His name is Wes. He\u2019s a mime, and Maxwell has him in his dastardly clutches. And only you can save him and then recruit him! Do note that he is, by far, the absolute weakest character in the game, with the lowest overall stats, and is meant to be played by experienced players who want a challenge. Wes can be found in the third chapter of Adventure Mode (if it\u2019s not the Two Worlds theme) in a structure of three rooms, two with  Maxwell\u2019s Statues, and poor Wes trapped in the third one. If you break any of the statues, undamaged Clockwork monsters will appear to attack you, and you need to break all the statues and defeat all the monsters before you can approach Wes. Once you do, when you get near him, even more Clockwork monsters spawn, and you have to defeat them all to release Wes, so be very careful when you find this poor little mime! Release . . . Maxwell? You know him, you hate him, and he revels in your misery. But now it\u2019s time for a little payback, don\u2019t you think? In lieu of spoilers, just know that you\u2019ll meet Maxwell himself in the final area of Adventure Mode, and after a series of events and some eerie and important exposition, you are given a choice. One lets you continue on as you were, the other shows you an \u201cending\u201d to the tale of Don\u2019t Starve, and lets you Exit Adventure Mode with Maxwell as your character! While despicable, Maxwell is one of the best characters to play! He constantly regenerates Sanity due to his smug dapperness, can spawn copies of himself, and even spawns with the Dark Sword and Nightmare Armor\u2014one of the best weapons and armor in the game\u2014in his inventory! To make up for this, his maximum health is the absolute lowest compared to character in the game, even Wes, so try to keep him alive to prolong his torment!",
