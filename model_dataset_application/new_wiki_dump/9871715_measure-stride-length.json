There are 5,280 feet (1,610 m) in a mile, so divide that by 2,000 to find your stride length. Calculating the Distance of 10 Steps Pick a starting place and mark it with an item. You can draw a line with sidewalk chalk on your driveway, mark your spot with a pen, or use any household object to indicate your place. Take 10 natural steps forward starting with your right foot. Count your steps from 1 to 10 as you walk forward. For best results, try not to overthink your foot placement and walk normally. Make a mark in front of your right foot after 10 steps. If you used sidewalk chalk to mark your starting point, draw another line at the edge of your shoe. If you used an object (such as a pen) to mark your starting point, drop another object at the tip of your right foot. This mark indicates your stopping place. Measure the distance between your starting and stopping point.

If you want to ensure your measurements are as accurate as possible, repeat the process a few more times, and average the numbers together. To calculate your average, add up the total of all your stride lengths, and divide them by the total number of times measured. Estimating by Height Measure your height to the closest centimeter.
