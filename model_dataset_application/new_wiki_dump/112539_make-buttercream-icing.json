The cream of tarter is not essential, but will lead to a smoother frosting. 1-2 tablespoons of light corn syrup can help with this as well, and can be added with the tarter or alone."

The eggs will foam up and get to the \u201cribbon stage.\u201d This means that when you run your spatula through the eggs and lift up, the eggs will run down in a ribbon that settles on top of the egg mixture. You can't over whip the eggs! Just keep them going. You will not need the whites of the eggs after separating. They can be discarded."

As soon as it hits this temp, take it off the heat and turn off the burner. If the temperature exceeds 230 degrees, the mixture will reach the \"firm ball\" or \"hard ball\" stage. In these stages, the sugar syrup mixture will start to hold its shape if made into a ball. It won't be spreadable as icing anymore."

Be very careful and slow when pouring the sugar syrup into the egg mixture. Keep the mixer running as you pour. It\u2019s crucial that you pour very slowly. Otherwise, the hot sugar syrup will start to cook the eggs in the bowl."

If the butter is added all at once, it won\u2019t mix well with the eggs and you\u2019ll have chunky icing. You're creating an emulsion -- or mixture of two things that don't want to mix. It takes time. Keep the butter out on the counter to soften as you work. This way, when you add it, it will mix in much more easily. It\u2019s best if you use a paddle attachment with your stand mixer for this step. The whisk may have trouble mixing the butter with the rest of the mixture."

Leave the butter out of the fridge for an hour so that it will soften. It should give freely under your finger when pressed. Note. it doesn't need to be liquid -- just soft.

This will help you see how thick or thin your icing is getting. More cream leads to a more whipped icing, less leads to something more firm.
