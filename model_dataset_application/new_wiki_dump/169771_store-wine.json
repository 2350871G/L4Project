Lighter wines, including both red and white, fall into this category. Another indicator is the cork. If it's synthetic or a screw top, the wine is probably meant to be drunk fairly quickly. Most wines you'll see in the stores are meant to be consumed fairly quickly, usually within 5 years."

Similarly, in a wine store, a sommelier can help you determine which wines are meant for aging. Typically, though, these wines will have natural corks, and they will often set you back quite a bit more than your average wine. You can also buy wine at auctions or purchase wine \"futures\" from wineries, meaning you buy it before it comes out at a discounted price. Common regions that produce higher end wines for aging include Tuscany (Italy), Piedmont (Italy), Napa Valley (California), Priorat (Spain), Rioja (Spain), Burgundy (France), and Bordeaux (France)."

Wine needs to be kept out of the light, particularly sunlight, which can degrade it over time. Choose an area away from vibrating machinery because these vibrations can also degrade your wine. If you can't keep a bottle entirely out of the light, wrap it lightly in a cloth or simply put the bottle inside a box out of the way."

This is mainly important if you plan on storing wine for 10 years or so. However, storing wine on its side is also a good way to save space. When placing the bottles, try to store them so you don't have to move one to get to another. You want to leave the bottles alone as much as possible."

However, consistency in temperature is even more important. If you can keep it in area that only fluctuates between 68 to 73 \u00b0F (20 to 23 \u00b0C) instead of 45 to 65 \u00b0F (7 to 18 \u00b0C), that's better, as fluctuations can push wine out of the cork or draw air in. Avoid letting wine stay in temperatures over 75 \u00b0F (24 \u00b0C), except for very short periods. Wine starts to oxidize at this temperature. Also, don't let the wine drop below 45 \u00b0F (7 \u00b0C), as that slows down the aging process. Plus, if it begins to freeze, the expanding wine could pop the cork out, ruining your wine. If you can't find a space that's cool enough, try a cooling unit that's made for wine."

However, you should check how dry your storage area is with a hygrometer (humidity reader) and make sure it stays within this range. This is most important if you're storing wines for longer than 10 years. Over time, the cork can dry out if the humidity is too low. You can add a pan of water or even a cool humidifier if the room is not humid enough. Humidity over 80% may encourage mold growth. You can use a dehumidifier if you need to decrease the humidity."
