If your sink is especially dirty, you may need to switch out for a fresh cloth. In many cases, it is best to wipe the sink down when it is dry, so you'll be able to remove hair, grime, and other debris easily. Wipe down the sink on a daily basis, if needed."

Turn on the faucet and run hot water into the sink. Hot water will loosen soap scum, grime, and dirt. Splash the water around the surface \u2013 including the sides \u2013 of the sink.

Most bathroom cleaners are formulated to clean bathroom sinks. You may be able to use a tub and tile cleaner or a cleaner formulated for the type of material you sink is made of. In most cases, this is porcelain. Make sure the cleaner is a disinfectant. This is important as bathroom sinks can potentially accumulate a variety of germs.

Without scrubbing your baking soda into the sink, you won't be able to remove all stains. Swirl your cloth around in circles while you rub the baking soda into the surface of the sink. Consider using a regular cotton cloth. Microfiber may not have the abrasive power you need to remove some stains. In some instances, you may need to use a mildly abrasive dish sponge."

If your sink doesn't drain properly, you may need to wipe the baking soda out with cloth rags or paper towels."

Hair shavings not only dirty your sink, but they can partially clog your pipes. As a result, normal dirt and grime will build up in the basin. If you shave in front of the sink, put a towel over the sink so your hair falls into the towel. If you do wash hair down the drain of the sink, your sink will eventually clog up. When this happens, you'll have to remove the accumulated hair with a coat hanger, or use a chemical clog removing product."

Because of the presence of moisture, metal will quickly rust and leave a stain. If you have a rust stain, take an old eraser and wipe it against the stain. If the rust stain won't come out with baking soda or an eraser, you may need to use an abrasive cleaner like Comet cleaning powder. However, make sure whatever product you use is safe on the material your sink is made of."
