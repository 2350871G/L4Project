When you\u2019re just getting started, it\u2019s a good idea to stick with something short and uncomplicated. Longer quotes allow you to try out more font styles, but they\u2019re also harder to manage and can be time consuming."

For example, if your quote is inspirational, then you might go with a theme of inspiration. Your design might include shooting stars and bold colors. If your quote is about beauty, then you might choose fonts and embellishments that reflect beauty, such as swooping cursive letters and bright colors."
