          "description":"In some situations, you might feel exposed or embarrassed if the people you\u2019re conversing with find out that you\u2019re not well-versed on a certain subject. In these cases, try to act more confidently than you feel and you\u2019ll come across as if you have knowledge that you don\u2019t. As long as your conversation partners don\u2019t grill you too hard, you should be able to pull off the bluff. For example, if you\u2019re talking with friends who are classical music buffs, one may say, \u201cI\u2019ve always found Beethoven\u2019s melodies a bit dry; Bach is more to my liking.\u201d If the speaker turns to you, try bluffing by saying, \u201cI agree; Bach\u2019s music has wonderful melodies!\u201d\nOr, say you\u2019re at a wine tasting with wine-enthusiast friends. If you don\u2019t know much about wine, listen to what others are saying about the different varieties and characteristics. Then rephrase their observations or opinions so you sound like you know what you're talking about."

That way, you\u2019ll soak up information that could come in handy later when you decide to bluff. When you bluff, you want to come across as knowledgeable, not cocky and ignorant. If someone calls your bluff, you may find yourself in trouble! Let\u2019s return to the Bach example. If you were to say to your friend, \u201cI think that Mozart has sublime melodies, especially when he writes for the saxophone,\u201d your friend would immediately point out that Mozart never wrote for the saxophone, and your bluff would be exposed."

The guiltier others look, the more innocent you\u2019ll look by comparison. So, try to bluff by questioning others\u2019 motives (making them look guilty) and deflect any suspicion away from yourself. For example, in a game of Mafia you might say, \u201cI heard Matt making a lot of noise while everyone\u2019s eyes were closed \u2026 my guess is that he\u2019s the mafia and was pointing out who to kill!

Try directly lying about what character you\u2019re playing (e.g., Mordred in Avalon or the police in Mafia) by pointing out reasons why you couldn\u2019t be that character that relate to your real-life actions or positioning in the room. For example, in a game of Mafia, you could bluff by saying you were in the bathroom when a player was \u201ckilled,\u201d and so you couldn\u2019t be the mafia character. Or say that, had you been the doctor in Mafia, you would\u2019ve saved your boyfriend from being \u201ckilled\u201d off. Say that you\u2019re playing Avalon, and the evil characters accuse you of being the wizard Merlin. Bluff your way out by saying, \u201cThere\u2019s no way I could be Merlin! If I were, I would have already convinced you guys of who all the evil players are. I\u2019m a great Merlin when I get the chance. Whoever is the real Merlin is doing a lousy job.\u201d"

          "description":"Bluffing when you\u2019re facing down a large number of opponents (e.g., a full poker table of 8 players) rarely works. Even if 1 or 2 players are intimidated by your large bet and fold, there will likely be at least 2 or 3 that keep playing. So, save your bluffing for later in the poker game when there are only 3 or 4 players at the table. If you\u2019re only playing against 2 people from the beginning, you can begin bluffing right away."

          "description":"Most poker players get excited when they see a large pot of money and are less inclined to fold their cards. So, your bluff will be ineffective and you\u2019ll end up losing the hand if you try to bluff on a huge pot of money. For example, say you\u2019re playing in a game with a $5 buy-in and a $2 minimum bet. Don\u2019t bluff on a $75 pot; most players will want the money and will be disinclined to fold."

          "description":"Most bets in poker revolve around the strength of a player\u2019s overall hand. However, it\u2019s possible (and not necessarily uncommon) to win on the strength of a high card alone if none of the players have at least 1 pair. So, bluff when you have a high card in your hand, even if you\u2019re nowhere  near to having any pairs, a straight, a flush, etc. For example, say you\u2019re playing Texas Hold-Em. Depending on the flop (the 5 cards turned over by the dealer), a hand of Q\u2665 9\u2663 isn\u2019t particularly good. However, your queen could end up winning the pot as a high card. So, you may as well bluff, since in a way you have nothing to lose."

So, don\u2019t bluff just because you haven\u2019t done it in 20 minutes or because you\u2019re bored. Only bluff in instances when you think you\u2019ll win. The idea is to keep your opponents on their toes. Bluffing works best if your opponents don\u2019t know when you are or are not doing it."

          "description":"It\u2019s not always necessary to drop a $100 bluff into the pot in order to cause your opponents to fold. Often a bluff that\u2019s only slightly too large for the opponents to comfortably call will make them fold just as successfully as a massive bluff would. If you try making a small bluff once or twice and notice that you\u2019re not scaring off any players, then you can start making larger bluffs. Dropping a huge bet\u2014e.g., $100 in a game with a $10 buy-in and $5 minimum bet\u2014may alert skilled players that you\u2019re bluffing. If they don\u2019t fold, you\u2019ll lose a lot of money. As a rule of thumb, try to bluff an amount that\u2019s roughly consistent with previous bets. If your bets are all within $20 of each other whether you\u2019re bluffing or not, your opponents will have a hard time calling your bluffs, and will likely fall for the bluff."

          "description":"A semi-bluff is a strategy commonly used by poker players when they have a decent hand but not one that\u2019s guaranteed to win. When you make a semi-bluff, you\u2019re essentially suggesting that your hand is much stronger than it is. A semi-bluff is often enough to make inexperienced players fold. Even if players stay in the game, you\u2019ll still have a pretty decent hand that may win on its own. For example, say you are holding 6\u2665 A\u2663 and there\u2019s a 7\u2665 on the table. This isn\u2019t a great hand, since you\u2019re not guaranteed a heart straight (you\u2019d need 3 more consecutive hearts) and a flush isn\u2019t likely (you\u2019d need 3 more red cards). But, the hand is not awful either. So, make a moderate bet of $35 and try to semi-bluff your opponents."
