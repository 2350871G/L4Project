You'll move even slower than before, but stepping over it is risky. If you do want to get over it (after knocking it down), try propping yourself up on your front foot with O. Once your front calf is tilted a little forward of vertical, hit Q and W vigorously to clear the hurdle. It's very hard to do this without falling over.
