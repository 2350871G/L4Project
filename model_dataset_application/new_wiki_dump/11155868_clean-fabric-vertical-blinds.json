          "description":"If your blinds are pulled back or off to one side, release, slide, or pull them open so that all of the vertical panels hang where the flat, wide surface is facing you. This will make it easier for you to see and reach the entire front and back surfaces of the fabric blinds."

          "description":"Follow the instructions for your vacuum to switch from the ground setting to the hose setting. Then, attach the soft brush head to the end of the hose. You can usually find the soft brush head attachment on the side of your vacuum, and attach it by simply slipping it on top of the end of the hose. If you don\u2019t have a soft brush head attachment, you may be able to purchase one separately. If not, you can just use the hose setting, though using a soft brush head attachment will keep the vacuum from harming the fabric."

          "headline":"Vacuum each of the fabric blind panels.",
          "description":"After attaching the soft brush head attachment, turn on the vacuum. Run the vacuum hose down each panel, starting at the top. Pay extra close attention to any creases or seams in the fabric, as these tend to gather more dust and dirt. Repeat on the back until you have vacuumed both sides of the blind panels. If the brush head appears clogged or if you notice dirt getting left behind after passing over a spot, you may need to periodically stop and clear the brush head opening if your blinds are particularly dusty."

          "headline":"Combine mild dish soap and water for a gentle cleaning solution.",
          "description":"In a large bowl, mix in about 4 tablespoons (59 mL) of mild dish soap with approximately 4 cups (950 mL) of water. Stir the soap and water well with a spoon until the solution is completely combined. Mild dish soap is recommended because it is a mild cleaner that generally won\u2019t damage or discolor fabric. While dish soap is cheaper and generally as effective, you can also use a liquid spot clean stain remover. When using a liquid spot clean stain remover, follow the instructions on the label and make sure to check that the stain remover you choose is safe for the fabric."

Starting at the top of the blinds, spot clean any stains by dabbing the microfiber cloth with the soap solution on the stains. Work your way down the front before flipping it over and spot cleaning the back. Repeat this on each blind until all of them are spot cleaned. If the cloth gets too wet, gently wring it out so that it won\u2019t drip down the blinds or on your floor. If you don\u2019t have a clean microfiber cloth on hand, you can also use a clean acrylic or polyester sock. You may want to test out the soap solution on an inconspicuous area before applying it to all the stains on the blinds. If you do this, wait a few minutes after applying the test spot to make sure that it hasn\u2019t had an adverse reaction with your fabric blinds."
