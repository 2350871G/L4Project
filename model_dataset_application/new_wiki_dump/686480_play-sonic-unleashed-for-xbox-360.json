  "text":" Controller Basics When you're holding the controller, put your index & middle finger on the trigger and bumper buttons (so you'll be ready to drift when needed) and put your left thumb on the right analog stick and left thumb on the A,X,Y and B buttons.

Many new skills and upgrades can be obtained through certain conditions, progressing through the game, or by buying them with yellow diamonds you get from enemies.  Boosting Guidelines To reach the highest speeds, drift in a straight line (this is not something you need to do, but it does speed you along and again it's more of an expert technique).  When you're on a slope going upwards, when near you're near top of it, jump and it will give you maximum height and to boost over some areas.  Try boosting then jumping right after then boosting again in the air to boost over a whole area.  Attacking Techniques The main method of defeating enemies is the homing attack. Try to use this also for combo attacks for bonus points and getting to places beyond Sonic's reach or to correct any missed/wrongly timed jumps. Stomping is another way of attacking enemies and is used best when attacking from above or when a homing attack doesn't work or isn't as effective.  Ironically enough, you can actually use the speed boost and drift to take down groups of enemies at high speeds that you normally can't take down or would take longer with conventional attack moves.  2D Platforming 2D sections are more platform based and as a result are much harder and take longer to do. Remember to not be as reckless when going through these sections; do not use the speed boost unless Sonic is running in a harmless path. Properly time your homing attacks, crouches, light speed dashes, and wall jumps by being as fast as possible, pressing the button combos well, and by following the on-screen button prompt as it's needed in order to succeed through 2D platforming.  Take alternate routes with cannons, grind rails, zip-lines, and other mechanisms to skip large portions of the 2D sections with little to no risk.  Tricks There are many tricks and techniques that aren't mentioned in the game or is difficult to pull off. One should master them to beat the levels more easily and have a better time, which includes the aerial boost, parkour, sky diving, and drifting. Aerial boosting is simply pressing a set of buttons that appear on-screen when Sonic files into the air and everything becomes slow; successfully pressing these buttons within a short time allows Sonic to go over gaps and reach out of reach places.  Parkour tricks such as running on walls and wall-jumping (in 3D areas) can be utilized by speed boosting on walls and pressing the button that appears on-screen when Sonic attempts to wall-jump on certain walls.  Sky diving is simply diving really fast while in the air after Sonic is free falling to an area below; pressing the X button will increase your speed while titling the control stick controls your position which can help avoid obstacles and reach the ground faster.  Drifting is turning around sharp corners without losing speed; this is difficult to maneuver as Sonic's natural speed interferes with his handling - simply tilt the control stick left and right (slightly) to make drifting easier to do.
