They are made in China and extremely cheap. The other two are made in the American Midwest and harder to find. They cost twice as much as the ones from China. The one shown on the extreme right has been in use since 1990. The one in the middle has been used for two years.Compare the gauge of the metal used in the spring that holds the clip together. The cheap imported ones are better used for art projects (hence the pom poms). Entrust your wet and heavy laundry to the cheap clothespins and you may learn the hard way that they are not trustworthy. Your local Home Depot probably only stocks the cheap ones that you don't want to use. Go to your independent hardware store and ask if they will special order the sturdier ones for you. It takes a few days, but it is worth the wait. Maybe if enough people insist on the better ones, the default item stocked in stores will be the sturdy ones."
