If you have basic temperature controls and your greenhouse's range is between 60\u201380 \u00b0F (16\u201327 \u00b0C), for example, you could plant jasmine flowers (which grow well in that temperature range)."

Save space in your greenhouse for plants that would thrive better or couldn't otherwise grow outdoors in your area. If you live in a cold climate, for example, you could grow plants that prefer warm weather like okra or sweet potatoes. A greenhouse can also be used to start seeds before the spring or summer planting seasons. This is a great alternative to starting seeds indoors on a window sill or a supplemental light source. When the weather is ideal you can plant them outdoors when they are large enough."
