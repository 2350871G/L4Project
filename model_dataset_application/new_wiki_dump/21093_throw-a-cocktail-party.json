This way you can concentrate on making sure your guests are having a great time instead of being stuck behind the bar frazzled by complicated drink requests. Make a mixed drink, such as rum punch, that you can prepare ahead of time and in great quantity so your guests can grab a drink as soon as they arrive. Prepare in advance a batch of signature mocktails, such as sparkling peach punch, for those who prefer not to drink alcohol. This would be especially relevant if you know there will be children at your party. You can assume each guest will down 1-2 drinks per hour. Count up your guests and the length of your party to get a good idea of how many drinks you should provide."

          "description":"While a signature drink will cut down on individual drink requests, make sure that you still have a fully stocked bar for that guest who just isn\u2019t into the cocktail you\u2019re serving. Happy guests equals a fun party! Make sure you provide a few types of beer and red and white wine for those who don\u2019t find themselves wanting a mixed drink. Have the basic spirits on hand, such as whiskey, gin, tequila, brandy, rum, and vodka. You\u2019ll be able to whip up a martini in no time! Don't forget mixers and garnishes. Basic mixers include tonic, club soda, and a variety of sodas. Cut up lemons and limes ahead of time as a garnish for drinks. Then you\u2019ll be all set for any guests wanting a gin and tonic."

          "headline":"Acquire appropriate glassware.",
          "description":"You should have a variety of glasses on hand depending on the types of drinks you plan to offer. A good plan is to have twice as many glasses as guests. It\u2019s a party and glasses will surely be broken. You can always rent glassware if you\u2019d prefer not to invest in large amounts of cocktail glasses. Basic glassware to have around includes wine glasses, straight-sided highballs, pint glasses for beers, tumblers for liquor, martini glasses, and champagne flutes. Provide glass charms for your guests to identify their glass since they\u2019ll be moving around socializing and might lose track of their glass."

          "description":"Ice will run out more quickly than you\u2019d think at a cocktail party so stock up! Remember that you're not just using it for drinks, but also for chilling. Larger ice cubes will melt less quickly in cocktail drinks so purchase a silicone mold and make several batches ahead of time. Don\u2019t place all your ice out for your guests at once - it will melt so keep some reserves in the freezer."

Alcohol and an empty stomach simply don\u2019t go well together! Plan on each guest eating 2-3 appetizers. Common snacks include cheese and meat boards and assorted olive, nut, or fruit platters.
