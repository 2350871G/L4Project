      "description":"Prior Planning Prevents Piss Poor Performance. Prior planning can allow you to make quick split-second decisions later on. Don't just dive into an area. Take your time to observe it and analyze the environment. Take note of where you can hide, where you'll be exposed, and where enemies travel. When analyzing your environment, use night vision, thermal, and the electromagnetic vision. Each mode is suited to certain conditions."

    {
      "headline":"Use thermal vision.",
      "description":"Thermal vision is excellent for identifying laser beams and spotting people quickly. Thermal can spot people regardless of lighting conditions. It's best used for obtaining a quick body count and looking \"through\" a door. In addition to spotting warm bodies and laser beams, the thermal vision can, within a certain range, pick up cameras and light fixtures. This can help you verify the locations of such items."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Use your night vision.",
      "description":"The night vision gives you enhanced vision in areas with low lighting. Use it to allow you to distinguish your environment in such cases. This helps you with movement. While this vision mode will be used often, do not rely on it. It is very prone to washouts in moderate and bright lighting conditions. A washout is when your field of view begins to turn white due to excessive light reflection. In the instance of a washout, you will not be able to discern any shapes visually and will effectively be blinded."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Consider using electromagnetic vision.",
      "description":"The electromagnetic vision can feel the most cumbersome since it gives you very little information. That \"little\" amount of information is, however, extremely important. It allows you to identify any electronic devices in the area. This includes, and is not limited to cameras and lights. The reason those are mentioned is because they are your greatest electronic threats. Cameras may be difficult to spot due to poor lighting and positioning. Use the electromagnetic vision to determine the location of electronic devices, then use the night vision or regular vision to determine exactly what each device is."

    {
      "headline":"Plan your move before making it, and mentally rehearse it.",
      "description":"As you play the game more, you'll get a better feel for what you can and can't do in a certain time span. If your planned action involves shooting several objects or enemies, whether it be lethal or non-lethal, practice the motion of moving from target to target first. When planning, also take into account the consequences and repercussions of your planned actions."

      "description":"Sometimes, things just don't go the way you want. If you plan for multiple scenarios, you're less likely to be caught off guard. When planning your secondary and tertiary plans, they shouldn't duplicate the primary plan. Rather, they should branch off of the primary plan. The secondary plan is what you'll fall back to if something happens during the primary plan. The tertiary plan is what you'll fall back to if something happens during your secondary plan. Sometimes the backup plans may consist of moving to a predetermined hiding location such as climbing onto something, or jumping up and grabbing onto an overhead pipe. They may also consist of direct action against the hostile forces. This may include attacking them with your weapons or with hand-to-hand combat techniques. In the case that you use your weapon, have it equipped for your preference prior to taking action. If you want to use sticky shockers, have the SC-20K set up with the launcher attachment and sticky shockers active before taking action. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/3\\/34\\/Play-Splinter-Cell-Step-7Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Play-Splinter-Cell-Step-7Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/3\\/34\\/Play-Splinter-Cell-Step-7Bullet1.jpg\\/aid48162-v4-578px-Play-Splinter-Cell-Step-7Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":334,\"bigWidth\":\"578\",\"bigHeight\":\"420\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"

In such cases and cases where enemies aren't quite sure where you are, but know you're around, they may hit you with a few rounds (bullets).
