This will make it easier to load and unload the snow. You don\u2019t want a shovel that\u2019s too big or that contains softer materials. You won\u2019t have to bend as much if you choose a shovel with a S-shaped shaft. You can use a shovel with a C-shaped blade, called a pusher, on lighter, fluffier snow that doesn\u2019t weigh as much. You can apply lubricant to help your shovel move more easily through the snow. Options include non-stick cooking spray, W-D 40, paraffin wax or other similar products. Before applying, make sure your shovel is dry and warm. You can reapply as necessary."

You could always pay a neighbor kid to shovel for you. The key to success when having to remove snow by hand is to start as soon as possible. You should shovel several times during a storm. It\u2019s also easier to shovel less early fallen snow than thicker deeper snow, so do the shoveling in parts. Avoid heaping the snow against foundation walls, where it can melt, refreeze, and cause problems. You want to shovel down to the pavement so that the sun\u2019s rays will hopefully hit it and stop ice from forming on the pavement or public space. Another reason to remove the snow right away is because it will be harder to do so once it\u2019s packed down by foot traffic or vehicles."

          "description":"You can easily strain your back or knees when shoveling. However, there are ways to prevent this. It's important not to overload the shovel; work with manageable amounts of snow. Focus on pushing the snow instead of lifting it whenever possible, and take plenty of breaks. When you have to lift a load of snow, squat and lift using the power of your legs. Keep your back straight. Avoid jackknifing your body and lifting from your lower back, will save you from getting a back injury. Make sure the shovel is long enough. If you're trying to use a shovel that's too short for your height, you will increase the chances you will strain your back.You want to pick a shovel length where the blade will touch the ground, requiring you to only slightly bend your knees and so you don't have to lean forward a lot. The shovel's handle should be at chest length if you were to stand the shovel on its end. Keep the bottom edge of your shovel in good condition by by using a hand file or bench grinder to smooth out any dents or rough edges."

Shoveling it from your driveway into the sidewalk can run afoul of city ordinances. It\u2019s a better idea to shovel it from the pavement onto the yard itself.

          "description":"If you have a large area to clear, and you need to do it fast, it will be a lot easier if you have a snowblower. This machine is a good alternative to shoveling when there\u2019s at least 1 \u00bd inches of snow on the pavement or public space. Move up and down the length of the pavement. Try to point the snowblower's chute downwind if you can. Work in circles so the chute will throw snow to different sides. Before you use the snowblower, spray its exit chute with furniture polish or silicone. This will stop the snow from sticking. When snow blowing, throw the snow as far into the yard as you can so it doesn't stack up too high on the edges. After you buy the snowblower, read the owner\u2019s manual. Make sure you are using the correct fuel in it because, if you don\u2019t, you could harm the engine. For example, some engines can\u2019t tolerate gas with too much ethanol in it.Don\u2019t leave the fuel sitting in the tank if you\u2019re not going to use it for more than 30 days. It can damage the fuel system because it will deteriorate inside of it. If you\u2019re concerned about the environment, it\u2019s possible to purchase an electric snowblower instead of using a gas-powered machine. Follow all the machine\u2019s operating and safety instructions properly. The debris dispersed by snowblowers can break house or car windows, if thrown powerfully enough. Never stick your hand or a tool of any kind into the machine with it running."

Most Landscape companies in heavy snowfall regions offer snow- and ice-management services. Don\u2019t wait too long into a storm or the service may already be booked up. You will have to pay a fee depending on the property. Start booking snow removal services in mid-September if you know you will need it. Ask about any \u201croll-out minimums,\u201d meaning the minimum level of snowfall for which they will dispatch clearing services. Also inquire as to their procedures during heavy snowfall. For example, do they come multiples times or just once. Snow removal services have equipment with plows so it will be a lot easier for them to clear a large area. You should be able to find these services online in your area, through word-of-mouth, or in the phone book. Prices will vary depending on where you live, but it can cost as little as $30-45 to clear a driveway size area."

People lay down these wires when they are installing or replacing a driveway, usually. They will have to pay for electricity costs, though. The way this works is that the electrical wires radiate heat upwards, melting the snow, so you don\u2019t have to shovel it! This is most feasible on your own property's pavement. Radiant fluid systems are another option and may prove to be a safer, more user-friendly choice in heavy snowfall regions."

The chemical will melt snowfalls that are less than two inches. It will also keep ice from adhering to hard surfaces like pavement or public spaces. You can also apply deicers during a snowfall after you\u2019ve removed the first layer of snow. You should expect to use about 1 gallon of the chemical for every 1,000 square feet of pavement. You should be able to buy it at hardware stores. Chemicals can be very toxic to plants and animals. Follow all directions, and consider other methods if you have pets or expensive landscaping."

You can purchase rock salt, otherwise known as sodium chloride, at many gas stations or grocery stores. Store the rock salt in a sealed bucket, and spread it around the public space or pavement with a handheld spreader or a push spreader. It will melt the ice and prevent the area from being a hazard for slipping. Use about a handful for every square yard. If you\u2019re not a fan of salt, you could try urea, which is usually used as a fertilizer and performs the same function as rock salt. It can be hard to find, though. The key is to find a deicer. Alfalfa meal is another fertilizer that helps melt snow. One downside of rock salt is that it can harm plants or pets, and it doesn\u2019t really work if the temperature is below 25 degrees. It can also leach into soil."

Calcium chloride is effective with colder temperatures than rock salt. It works with temperatures of up to minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit. Calcium chloride can be harmful to pets or animals, and it costs a lot more than rock salt, though. It also can cause a surface to become slippery. Prolonged use of chemical snow melt can damage concrete and asphalt, if used to excess. Treat sparingly."

The sand and kitty litter work because they add traction to icy surfaces. They make it less likely that a person will fall. The downside of kitty litter is that it will still be there and look messy when the snow melts. You want to choose sandbox sand that is thicker instead of mason\u2019s sand because mason\u2019s sand is too fine. You could also use bird seed for this same purpose."
