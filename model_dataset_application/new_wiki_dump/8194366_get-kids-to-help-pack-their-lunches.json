Some ideas for a lunch packing station include:\nAllocating some cabinet space for your kids' snacks. For younger kids, you may want to put these in easily accessible containers (like open-topped baskets) on easy to reach shelves. Using a separate shelf for lunchboxes and clean plastic containers. This way, your kids always know where to store and find their lunchbox and plastic containers. Use safe labeling techniques to differentiate shelf space between kids, to designate lunch boxes, plastic containers, and so on.

When you notice your kids doing especially well and earning many points, tell them what a great job they're doing. You can award points any way you see fit. For example, you might award one point for packing veggies, one point for fruit, one point for a sandwich, one point for cleaning up, and so on. You may want to make a point chart, so your kids can see their progress. Hang this chart somewhere visible, and mark points earned each day."

Do this by praising the efforts of your kids as they learn and develop good lunch packing habits. Involve your kids in their own lunch making improvement by asking questions like, \"how do you think you could pack your lunch better?\" or \"is there anything that would help you make your lunches more easily?\" Be sure to focus your praise on the applied effort of your children, on their work ethic, on their improvement in certain areas, and so on. This will help prevent children who are lower performers from feeling like they are not as good as higher performers."
