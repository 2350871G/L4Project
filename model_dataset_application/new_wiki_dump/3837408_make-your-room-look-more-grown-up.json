          "headline":"Choose the right color scheme.",
          "description":"Since your color choices for the walls, bed, and curtains are going to create the main vibe of your room, stay away from pastel colors like pink and yellow. Pastels sometimes give the room a \"nursery\" atmosphere, but can work if used properly. Avoid colors that are very dark or neon. Gender neutral colors to consider are purple, orange and green. Choose contrasting colors that look trendy, youthful and really pop, like rich dark purple with yellow. Bright red also goes great with purple, and so does black. Stick with neutrals if you like to change your color scheme often. This makes it easier to switch your accent colors."

          "headline":"Work with the color scheme you have.",
          "description":"Instead of a full color revamp, you could instead try playing off the color scheme that's there already. By updating and accenting the current color scheme, you can vastly change the appearance of your room. For instance, if your room currently features a lot of pastel pink, update it by adding accent colors like fuchsia, hot pink and chocolate brown. If your room currently features a lot of pastel blue, update it by adding some royal blue accents and maybe even hunter green. Whatever you end up going with, strive to choose colors that contrast and play off one another."

          "headline":"Paint an accent wall.",
          "description":"Since you\u2019re going darker with your color theme, paint only a single \u201caccent\u201d wall in your newly chosen shade. Dark paint on all four walls can make your room feel much smaller and more cramped than it is. Streamlining in any way that makes your room look bigger and less cluttered will make it appear more adult. If your parents are reluctant to let you paint your walls, they will be a lot more willing to allow you to paint just one. Make sure that the paint job is done neatly so that everything looks nice and crisp. If you don\u2019t want to paint a wall, then try using peel and stick wall paper, a wall decal or stencil, or a tapestry to accent the wall."

          "headline":"Add a pop culture flair.",
          "description":"As a teenager, pop culture is around you all the time and you probably have evidence of it all over your room already. Use that to your advantage! For example, if you\u2019re really into music, collect all of your past concert ticket stubs and display them in a mountable case on the wall. Get rid of band posters unless they are nice enough to frame, then get nice frames for them. You could also use a guitar rack to neatly display your instruments, and maybe even put a keyboard somewhere in your room as a final dash of style. Check out your garage for cool items that you can re-purpose and display in your room. Cut out images and advertisements from magazines to accent the colors in your room in a unique way. Display old license plates on the wall for a colorful, masculine touch. Paint, hang, or display old surfboards, sporting equipment, and typewriters for a mature, vintage style."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Acquire some adult items.",
          "description":"Get nice frames for anything hanging on the wall. If your walls look bare, try buying some art prints and putting them in matching frames. If you don't own a desk or bookshelf and there's enough room, get one or both of them. Add a throw rug that matches your new color scheme. Throw rugs pull the look of a room together and look very adult. Get a plant for your window sill. Choose something low maintenance, like a fern or potted aloe vera plant. Arrange ore adult-like items on bookshelves, such as pictures and trinkets, and eliminate more juvenile items, such as stuffed animals and toys."

If you aren\u2019t sure what kind of design works best, choose bedding and trimmings that are solid colors. Add a dust ruffle to your bed that matches your new color scheme, which will hide any storage and clutter you might have underneath it."

Stack a few bright throw pillows on your bed and nestle a few into the bean bag chairs. Stack a few warm colored blankets on your bed in the wintertime for a cozy look. Try hanging colored lights (like Christmas tree lights or Chinese lanterns) around a window, your bed or a bookcase. This can add a fun dimension to your room.

The traditional place for a bed is on the wall opposite the door, so this would be the most mature looking choice. If you have a nice bed frame and headboard but your bed can't be seen from the door, move it so that it becomes the focal point. If you aren't sure, go with the arrangement that makes your room look the least cluttered. Open spaces are streamlined and more adult-looking than a cramped room. If at all possible, don\u2019t put your headboard against the same wall as your bedroom door, since this can have a disorienting effect on anyone who enters."

The last thing a mature-looking bedroom would ever have is a pile of plush dolls on the bed or lined up on the window sill. Also remove any dolls and put visible toys out of sight.
