Try planting in early spring or the weeks of fall before the first frost. Growing Romaine in the summer or a hot climate is more of a challenge, as temperatures above 80 \u00b0F (27 \u00b0C) will cause the lettuce to \u201cbolt,\u201d or shut down leaf production and turn brown."

You can grow Romaine in a pot, a planter, or in the ground, so store-bought or garden soil will both work just fine. Ideally the soil will be between 55 \u00b0F (13 \u00b0C) and 65 \u00b0F (18 \u00b0C)."

If it takes significantly more time, there may have been an issue with the seeds, the soil, or the weather.
