For example, if the mantel and the wall behind it are both white, decorate it with something colorful. Try to match the colors to the furniture or curtains in the room. If the mantel is dark, then use light-colored objects when decorating it. To make the mantel a focal point in the room, opt for a bold color. For instance, paint it bright orange if you have a modern space, or go for a bold looking by painting it a glossy black"

For example, you can use poinsettias in the winter and tulips in the spring. Hang garlands from the mantel using hooks. These can be made from fake plants.
