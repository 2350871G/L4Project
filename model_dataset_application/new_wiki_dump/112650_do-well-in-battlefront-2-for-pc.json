      "description":"Using your map is an easy way to avoid tanks and infantry if necessary. When you are assigned to defend or capture a CP (Command Post), a tank can be a good way to do it. If you run into a wall of troops, throw grenades and start shooting. It may take few lives to wipe out the troops, but you'll get more reinforcements for each completed objective. One of the easiest ways to do well is to get awards. Space is a good place to get lots of awards."

      "description":"Then head straight to the control center. Shoot out the auto cannons and take out a few pilots. Then roll/sprint to the shield room, which is straight ahead. Use time bombs or grenades and rockets to take out the shields. Using time bombs is a better option if the hangar is not heavily guarded, because it takes 8 rockets (or 6 rockets and 6 grenades) to destroy the shields (without the damage increase award) but only 4 timebombs. This will take more ammo than you have, so use the ammo droid located in the command center (repair it, if you have to) or kill some foes to get more. By this time, the auto cannons are probably back on, so shoot them again."

      "headline":"Take a right and go into the engine room.",
      "description":"Shoot the auto cannons. The reason for shooting the auto cannons is to protect yourself and each time you do this it gives you 1 point and you can even get awards (Energy Regeneration, Damage Reduction, Damage Increase, Precision Pistol or Elite Rifle) if you destroy them enough times. Blow up the engines. If you haven't died yet, you should get the award for endurance, guardian and maybe war hero."

      "description":"Shoot them if they have come back or ignore and run past them. Load up on ammo and health (it can be helpful if you hide behind the wall while doing it, because it is safer and the game only measures distance from droids, it doesn't matter if there is a wall between you and them, you will heal and your ammo will be replenished anyway). Go into the room on your left. Take out the auto cannon and at the end of the room, there should be a big screen. Blow it up."

Try to wait until pilots are just getting in them or near them to get more points. If done right, you should be close to winning. Do this 64 times to permanently get the fore-mentioned awards."
