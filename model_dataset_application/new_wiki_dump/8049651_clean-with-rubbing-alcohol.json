          "description":"Rubbing alcohol is a solution of isopropyl alcohol and distilled water. It is commonly sold at most big box stores, grocery stores, and hardware stores. Rubbing alcohol typically comes as 60% to 90% isopropyl alcohol and distilled water solution. Depending on what you\u2019re cleaning, you may want a higher or lower percentage. Sometimes rubbing alcohol will come as an ethanol and distilled water solution. For the purposes of cleaning, they are interchangeable. In addition to cleaning, rubbing alcohol has disinfectant properties and may kill bacteria or viruses."

          "description":"After you get your rubbing alcohol, you\u2019ll need to secure materials to use to help you clean. Ultimately, you\u2019ll be able to use a variety of cotton or other fabric products to aid in your cleaning. For surfaces that may scratch easily, consider microfiber rags. Such surfaces include plastic (like keyboards or mice), other computer accessories, or car components. For surfaces that are hard to access, you\u2019ll want to consider cotton Q-tips. Such surfaces include groves in plastic or metal auto parts. For surfaces in which you need a somewhat abrasive aid, use regular cotton rags or clothes. Whenever possible, use clean white rags to lessen the chance of color transfer."

          "description":"Before you begin the process of cleaning with rubbing alcohol, you need to make sure that the surface or material won\u2019t be damaged by it. This is important, since rubbing alcohol can damage certain surfaces. Read any care tag or directions that comes with whatever you\u2019re cleaning. Make sure you\u2019ve read care instructions on consumer electronics like LCD or LED screens. You should, particularly, avoid cleaning smartphone or tablet screens with rubbing alcohol. This could remove the fine, slick, coating that enables your touchscreen to work smoothly. Be careful when using alcohol on delicate and aged fabrics or finished wood. Rubbing alcohol may remove lacquer or finish from wood.

Allow the material to dry. Consider blowing or using a cool blow dryer to blow away dust or residual fibers left from a rag."
