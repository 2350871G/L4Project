Understand that your seller reputation on eBay's is primarily determined by your feedback score, therefore treating your customers right is not only common sense but good business too. In a conflict with a customer always use the eBay email system to communicate with them in order to establish a written record. Always keep your cool and be professional. If the customer is wrong consider the money involved in keeping a customer against the money involved in proving you are right. Consider offers for dissatisfied customers, even if they are wrong:\nGive them free shipping, or refund their shipping. Include a free gift in the package. Develop a listing that answers all questions about your sale, including your return, shipping and other customer service policies. Stick with it!

You may think of this preparation as creating an \"assembly line\". For example, you may set up a large 4' by 8' table with bubble wrap and packing materials at one end, products in the middle, and boxes, labels and packing tape at the far end. Buy and keep a selection of shipping boxes and shipping materials in your home. Consider setting aside an area of your home just to run your business. Create online shipping accounts with USPS, UPS or  your favorite shipper so you can print shipping labels at home. If you do a lot of shipping consider signing up for a pickup service, rather than lugging it all to the mailer yourself."
