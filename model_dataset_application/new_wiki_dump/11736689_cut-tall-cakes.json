Unstack the rest of the tiers this way and give each tier their own plate or flat surface. This will make it much easier to cut and will save you from having to reach up to the highest tier.Tip: If you are cutting your wedding cake, leave it intact for the photo and then unstack it to cut and serve to your guests. Some cakes have wax paper inserts in between each layer to avoid getting frosting everywhere. If yours doesn\u2019t, try to touch the top of the cakes as little as possible as you move them around."
