These can line the scraps bin and will save you a bit of washing time. These bags ensure that the storage of kitchen scraps is less messy and smelly on the whole. See photo above for an example."

And yet, your kitchen scraps bin is probably mounting up between visits. One simple solution is to have two kitchen scrap bins and to leave one at the back door or some other non-intrusive place when it is full, and to start on the next one. When the next compost bin visit is possible, you can collect both scrap bins and carry them with you."
