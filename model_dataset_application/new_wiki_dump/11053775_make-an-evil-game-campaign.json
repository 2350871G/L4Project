Excessive torture, vore, or other over the top violence is often unnecessary,  just leave it out. In certain situations you may want to ban racial slurs or just swearing in general.

A perfect utopia that has been withheld for centuries would probably not be toppled easily. On the other side a barren wasteland would be far too easy to conquer since next to no one will actually live there. Give your villains something to do. It\u2019s no fun to just sit around in a castle all day and do nothing. For example you can create little settlements that they can take over and give them incentive to do so like letting them take the towns tax dollars."

Don\u2019t give your characters cliched or overused backstories like being an incarnation of pure evil or something like that. Remember that this is an evil campaign and your characters are supposed to be evil. If your backstory sounds too much like a hero origin then do something to make it more fitting. Don\u2019t come up with over complicated backstories. Cut out any unnecessary information, we don\u2019t need to know your characters favourite colour, food, activity, and whatnot. If you want the campaign to be more of a silly campaign than you can give the characters purposely bad or confusing backstories, just be sure that your GM has a good sense of humour."

Your bad guys aren\u2019t just going to give up half the spoils to a guy who could probably be easily replaced. Now you could make a rule saying the players can\u2019t betray one another but it breaks the immersion so it is not recommended. Don\u2019t make one member of the party significantly more powerful than the others. Either the powerful one will decide the others are no longer of use to him or the weaker ones will fear being taken out and gang up to take out the powerful one. Don\u2019t give any of your villains a large army. As soon as your companions become replaceable there isn\u2019t really any in-universe reason to keep them around. Give the villains a goal that requires them to work together. Something like the security system guarding the magic crystal requiring multiple people to deactivate it is a good way to do this. Don\u2019t give the villains end goals that contradict each other. A villain who wants to enslave the world and one who wants to destroy it on the same team probably won\u2019t end well.

While it sounds appealing to be able to just slash through all your enemies the combat will quickly get stale and you won\u2019t be able to enter a village in person without getting immediately recognized and attacked. It is recommended that you start out from square one, while it is harder you get a greater sense of satisfaction and your characters will get more time to possibly become legitimate friends."

This is a common mistake that newcomers to evil campaigns make. Murder isn\u2019t always the easiest solution to a problem, it often attracts a lot of unwanted attention and conflict so it doesn\u2019t even really make sense in-universe. While you are definitely allowed to kill NPCs if it should come to that, you should usually try to come up with an alternative solution first. While it is generally okay to send minions into battle they should not be the only ones fighting. Not only are minions usually weak and unskilled but just blindly using them as cannon fodder is a waste of resources and you will also miss out on a ton of XP. Don\u2019t be a show off. You're trying to take over the world not become the realms top fashion model. If you want to use your fancy clothing to help you deceive someone then that is fine but you don\u2019t need to look like you just walked out of a hot topic all of the time.

Don\u2019t just outright betray the party out of nowhere. If your gonna start turning to the good side then you should do it gradually over time. If your character is starting to doubt their actions than it should have something to do with their backstory like finding out their supposedly dead family is still alive. Be absolutely certain the GM and other players are okay with it before betraying the party, it would be a real hassle for the GM to keep track of two stories at once and the game will really slow down in pace. If you're not okay with that then try taking a less direct approach to villainy like helping out the party in their goal while upholding your own moral code. You won\u2019t exactly be welcome as a redeemed villain. Do you seriously think that the NPCs are gonna automatically trust you after your group kidnapped their children?

If your characters are low ranking nobodies than no ones gonna bat an eyelash but they won\u2019t just randomly betray the party for no reason.
