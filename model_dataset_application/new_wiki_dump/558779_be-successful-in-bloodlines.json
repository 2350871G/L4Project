      "description":"Because Bloodlines isn't that popular or known as Mobsters, it may be hard for some to gain members in a short amount of time. However, working on adding people in the forums is a good suggestion for a start. The number of clan members you will use in attacking is 5 times your current level. So for example, a level 1 will use 5 members while a level 8 will use 40. You will be able to use 500 (maximum) when you reach level 100."

      "headline":"Think about what you want to do in the game.",
      "description":"Do you want to be a \"rider\"? Do you want to become a bounty hunter? Are you playing the game just for the missions? These answers will determine how to use your experience points. Most people favor the attack and defense area (depending on if they want to be an attacker or defender/rider) more than other areas. Always put at least one point in health."

    {
      "headline":"Keep up with powers.",
      "description":"Each clan member that you use will be using one physical, one sensory, and one mystical power. So with the allowed clan members equation, you'll want 5 times of powers as much as your current level (30 powers in each section for a level 6 or 100 powers in each section for a level 20). Be careful of powers that have \"upkeep\". It could become expensive if you're not taking care of your companion amount."

      "headline":"Avoid leveling up too fast.",
      "description":"You'll soon realize that the higher up you go, the lesser chances of bounties and attacks you can make."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Watch how you attack.",
      "description":"It's an unwritten \"etiquette\" rule that 3 attacks in a row is significant, whether it's a loss or win. It tells the person attacked that they can be beat and it tells the person attacking that they can beat someone. Some to most people would judge more than 4 or 5 consistent attacks to be an issue."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Create different characters.",
      "description":"Under \"My Vampire\", you can create up to 10 characters under your account. All characters will share clan members and favor points. Making different characters at different levels will give you more opportunities throughout the game. Just note that you are only allowed to switch between characters once an hour."
