      "description":"Decorating bags are also known as icing bags, frosting bags, or pastry bags. Decorating bags are small, triangular shaped bags that are made from cloth, plastic, or parchment paper. The bags are equipped with embellishing tips and filled with icing and used to pipe ornamental items such as icing flowers, borders, scrollwork, and lacework patterns."

      "headline":"Purchase as many decorating tips as your budget permits.",
      "description":"Decorating tips are often called decorating nozzles. Decorating tips are used to create decorative details such as basket-weave patterns, icing roses, and shell borders. Tips come in different shapes, and are applied with an icing or pastry bag full of icing. When the bag is pressed, the icing or cream is piped out in the shape of the tip. Drop flowers are produced with a single squeeze of the frosting bag, while rose petals are produced with practiced maneuvering of the tip and icing."

      "headline":"Learn about the different types of frosting.",
      "description":"Frosting and icing are often switched for each other. Americans tend to use the term \"frosting\" to mean the creamy, sugary substance that covers a cake, while individuals in other English speaking areas tend to use the term \"icing\". In the U.S.A., \"frosting\" commonly refers to the icing that is spread over the cake, while \"icing\" usually refers to decorative icing, such as piped borders and icing roses. There is different types of frosting (which can also double as filling where needed):\nFondant - Fondant is also called sugar paste. Fondant is an icing sugar dough that can be worked in much the same way as pie dough. Fondant can be rolled into smooth sheets and draped over cakes, making a smooth, flawless finish. Ganache - Ganache is a velvety smooth frosting. It is prepared by melting either dark or white chocolate, then mixing it with heavy cream. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/d\\/df\\/Learn-About-Common-Cake-Decorating-Terms-Step-7Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Learn-About-Common-Cake-Decorating-Terms-Step-7Bullet2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/d\\/df\\/Learn-About-Common-Cake-Decorating-Terms-Step-7Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Learn-About-Common-Cake-Decorating-Terms-Step-7Bullet2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nGumpaste - Gumpaste is an edible, clay-like dough.

Royal icing dries very hard and preserves indefinitely if stored in a cool, dry place, but is vulnerable to softening and drooping in high humidity. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/e0\\/Learn-About-Common-Cake-Decorating-Terms-Step-7Bullet6.jpg\\/v4-460px-Learn-About-Common-Cake-Decorating-Terms-Step-7Bullet6.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/e0\\/Learn-About-Common-Cake-Decorating-Terms-Step-7Bullet6.jpg\\/v4-760px-Learn-About-Common-Cake-Decorating-Terms-Step-7Bullet6.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"
