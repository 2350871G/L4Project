      "description":"When you jitter-click, your hand is basically vibrating, but hard enough to click the mouse. You want your finger to touch the left click button, but your wrist to be lifted off of the mouse slightly. It cannot be in a relaxed position. Make sure to take breaks often."

      "headline":"Arch your hand.",
      "description":"Your hand shouldn't be wrapped all the way around your mouse. Your finger should be hovering over the left click button, and it should be slightly arched. Keep in mind that this can get tiring, and it takes practice to perfect it."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Vibrate your hand.",
      "description":"Use the muscles in your arm or wrist to vibrate your hand. You may get faster click using your entire arm, but you may get better accuracy using your wrist. Make sure you are not pressing the mouse button to click, but vibrating your hand to click. Be careful when jitter-clicking. Jitter-clicking can hurt your arm, wrist, hand, and fingers over a long period of time. Try not to jitter for over 15 - 30 seconds. It can seriously damage your hand. Stretch your arms and fingers after practicing. Try using two fingers to jitter-click. Sometimes you can improve your speed using your index finger and middle finger, or even your index finger and thumb. This may cost you accuracy though. Try removing your pinky from the mouse to increase your speed."

    {
      "headline":"Do online click tests to test your clicking speed.",
      "description":"There are plenty of websites on the internet that will test your clicking speed. The average click speed is about 6 clicks per second (CPS). A fast clicker can click at about 9-12 clicks per second. The following are some websites you can use to test your clicking speed:\nhttps://clickspeedtest.com/\nhttps://www.click-test.com/\nhttps://cookie.riimu.net/speed/"

    {
      "headline":"Keep practicing.",
      "description":"This takes time to get good at. Use click speed testers, and try jitter-clicking in-game. Whenever you have an unplugged mouse, try jittering for a couple of seconds at a time. Eventually, it will become natural. If you succeed, then you should get around 7-9. If you become a master, you might reach 12 cps. Good Luck!"
