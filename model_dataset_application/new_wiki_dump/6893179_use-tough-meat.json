          "description":"Marination is the process of immersing food (in this case, meat) into a solution to add flavor and to tenderize the meat. All methods of tenderizing through marination use natural acids to break down the collagen fibers. Vinegars, wine, beer, fruit and milk products all contain natural acids that can be used separately or together to tenderize meat. The only tools needed are a non-metallic container to hold the ingredients and a good knife to cut up things like onion and garlic to be added to the marinade. The ingredients to use will vary by the type of meat and the desired flavors to be achieved. For beef, good marinades can be made from a base of red wine, any vinegar, beer, or fruits including tomato. Keep in mind that the flavor from the marinade will become a big part of the flavor profile for your meat. Good choices for a red wine- or beer-based marinade will include the addition of onion, oregano or basil, garlic and, of course, salt and pepper. When starting with a vinegar, good spice profiles also include onion and garlic but could also use herbs de Provence or rosemary. If you like sweetness added to beef, good fruits to use are apple and cherry although using fruits with pork and chicken are usually more successful."

Simply remove the meat after cooking, bring the juices to a boil and thicken with flour or cornstarch. If you use flour to thicken, lightly sprinkle flour into the juices while using a whisk to distribute and to remove any lumps. Dissolve cornstarch into about 1/4 cup of water and add the solution to the juices. Then cook for at least two minutes to cook in the cornstarch."

  "text":" Slicing Thinly Partially freeze the meat first. Beef roasts or even nice thick steaks can become more tender by slicing the meat thinly and then cooking.

Freezing Prepare meat for freezing by trimming, sectioning or prepping the meat for easy of handling after it has been defrosted. Freezing helps to tenderize meat because in the process of freezing, the sharp crystal created from the freezing water contained in the meat severs collagen fibers. Combine tenderizing techniques to improve the tenderization process. For example, when freezing, add a marinade to act during the period the meat will be frozen.
