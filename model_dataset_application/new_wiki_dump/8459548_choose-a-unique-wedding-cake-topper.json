          "description":"This can be a nice way of remembering a family member who\u2019s passed on or a family tradition. Beyond these reasons, heirlooms are often ornate, which means they won\u2019t look out of place topping your cake. Be sure you clean these thoroughly before using them as a topper. If you plan on using jewelry, you may want to have the piece cleaned by a jeweler first. Some heirlooms might be able to nest right on top of the cake. However, in some cases you may need to attach the item to skewers to make it more visible."

Make cut outs of your home states, mark your home town with a star, and complete the topper with your initials written somewhere on each cut out. These toppers can be made easily with high-quality paper and then attached to the cake with skewers or toothpicks. You may want to use card stock or some kind of rigid paper for this topper idea.
