So, sometimes the cup is facing up, while other times the cup faces down or to the side. Remember that the Big Dipper is a fixture of the Northern Hemisphere's sky. So you will only be able to see it and follow these guidelines if you are in the Northern Hemisphere. Here are some seasonal guidelines for finding the Big Dipper based on its location at midnight:\nIn the spring, the Big Dipper is located to the north of the North Star (Polaris) with the cup facing downward. In the summer, the Big Dipper is located just west of Polaris with the cup facing to the right. In the fall, the Big Dipper is situated to the south of Polaris with the cup facing upright. In the winter, the Big Dipper can be found to the east of Polaris with the cup facing towards the left."

          "description":"Latitude is the position north or south of the equator. The height of the North Star above the horizon is equal to the latitude of the observer. It cannot be seen by an observer on or below the Equator although, as a practical matter, it will be too close to the horizon to be observed south of 10 degrees of North Latitude. For reference, here are some latitudinal measurements of some major locations in the Northern Hemisphere:\nThe North Pole has a latitude of 90 degrees north. Reykjavik, Iceland has a latitude of 70 degrees north. Juneau, Alaska and Edinburgh, Scotland have a latitude of 60 degrees north. Seattle, Washington, New York City, and Venice, Italy have a latitude of 50 degrees north. Denver, Colorado and Seoul, South Korea have a latitude of 40 degrees north. New Orleans, Louisiana and Orlando, Florida have a latitude of 30 degrees north. Mexico City, Mexico and Kingston, Jamaica have a latitude of 20 degrees north. San Jose, Costa Rica and Panama City, Panama have a latitude of 10 degrees north. If you have access to the internet, you can use a latitude finder online to determine your latitude, like the one offered by NASA. If you don't know your latitude and you don't have access to the internet, you can determine your latitude by looking at the sun at noon.Put one flat board or stick in the ground pointing upwards so that it is perfectly perpendicular with the ground. Use another flat board on the top (making a T with the two boards), but tilt the top board toward the sun. The angle of the shadow cast by the sun will be the degree of your latitude. Note that these readings are only accurate on March 21st and September 21st (the spring and fall equinoxes). In the winter (specifically December 21st) you should subtract 23.45 degrees from your reading and in the summer (specifically June 21st) you should add 23.45 degrees. These variations in measurement exist because of the way the Earth is tilted when it orbits the sun. If you know your location in terms of degrees of latitude, face north and look for a moderately bright star that many degrees above the horizon. A fist held out at arm's length represents approximately 10 degrees in the sky and can be used to measure the height above the horizon."

The brightest star at the end of the handle of the Little Dipper is the North Star. The North Star (Polaris, or sometimes Dhruva Tara (fixed star), Taivaanneula (Heaven's Needle), or Lodestar) is a Second Magnitude multiple star about 430 light years from Earth.
