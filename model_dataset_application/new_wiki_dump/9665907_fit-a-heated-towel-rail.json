Any outlet in a bathroom will most likely be a GFCI outlet, but it\u2019s a good idea to test it with a circuit tester, which can be found at most major hardware stores. Plug something into the outlet when you test it that will clearly show whether it is conducting electricity, like a night-light or a radio. Then plug the tester into the same outlet and push the button on the tester. The outlet should stop conducting electricity. Use the reset button on the outlet to turn it back on. If you are hard-wiring the towel rail directly into your electrical system, you will need to find the electrical junction box instead. You may need to have one installed."
