In 1964, Congress issued federal standards regarding the production of bourbon. These standards include:\nIt must be made with no less than 51% corn. It must be aged in \"new\" charred oak barrels. \"Straight\" bourbon refers to bourbon that has been aged in these barrels for 2 years. It must be distilled to no more than 160 (U.S.) proof (80% alcohol by volume.) It must be entered into the barrel for aging at no more than 125 proof (62.5% alcohol by volume). It must be bottled (like other whiskeys) at 80 proof or more (40% alcohol by volume)."

As bourbon ages, it takes on a deeper brownish amber color, a richer flavor, and a slightly increased level of sweetness. Bourbon is aged in barrels, and during the extended aging process, normally 7-8 years, some of the bourbon will permeate through the wood of the barrel. This is called the \"Angels' Share.\" There is also a certain amount absorbed into the char of the barrel. This is extracted and labeled the \"Devil's Share.\" Jim Beam calls this the \"Devil's Cut.\" The barrels used for aging the bourbon are never used again. Instead, they are used to age soy sauce and whiskey (for instance, scotch) or are made into beautiful pieces of furniture."

Bourbons that have a high rye content are generally spicier than other bourbons and are known for their bold flavor. Common high rye bourbons include Bulleit, Old Grand Dad, and Basil Hayden. High Corn bourbons contain more than 51% corn. Bourbons with high corn content are often much sweeter than traditional bourbons. High corn bourbons include Old Charter and Baby Bourbon. Wheated bourbons are bourbons that substitute wheat for rye, making them a combination of corn, wheat, and barley. These bourbons are softer on the palate and have a stronger flavor of caramel or vanilla. Maker\u2019s Mark, Van Winkle bourbons, and Rebel Yell are some of the more common wheated varieties."
