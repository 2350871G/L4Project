Another option would be to place your item into a container so that you can soak it instead. If you are using a container, you don't need to use paper towels. The container must be deep enough to submerge the item."

          "description":"Rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol) comes in different percentages, so use the strongest one that you can find. Alternatively, you can use an acetone-based nail polish remover. Make sure that the paper towels are thoroughly soaked. If you placed your item into a container, fill the container with rubbing alcohol or acetone-based nail polish remover. If you have a manicure or sensitive skin, wear plastic or vinyl gloves for this step. Rubbing alcohol and acetone-based nail polish remover can both release fumes. Work in a well-ventilated area to prevent headaches."

If you are soaking the item, cover the container with a tight-fitting lid so that the solution doesn't evaporate."

Depending on the type of epoxy that you used, it may even start to soften and dissolve it! If you used acetone, check your item after 15 to 30 minutes. It is much stronger than rubbing alcohol and will work much faster as a result."

If you wore gloves previously, then you should put them back on now. If you soaked the item, just open the container and lift the item out."

          "description":"How much effort you end up putting into this depends on how thick the epoxy was layered on. If the epoxy is already peeling, you can just pull it off with your fingers. If it's still stuck to the item, try a paint scraper or chisel instead. Work quickly with acetone; if it dries, you won't be able to remove the epoxy. If the rubbing alcohol or acetone dries before you finish removing the epoxy, pour more of your solution over the affected area and keep working."

If that happens, wipe it down with a rag soaked in denatured alcohol or paint thinner. Denatured alcohol is a type of fuel, which you can find in camping supply stores. For more stubborn patches of residue, use a steel wool pad instead of a rag."

Scrapers, chisels, or even pliers will all work for this. Oven mitts will work just fine for this, but you may be able to maneuver the item better with welding gloves. A pot holder or towel may also work. Work quickly; the epoxy will be harder to remove as it cools. If the epoxy hardens before you remove it, place the item back into the pot for another 5 minutes or so."
