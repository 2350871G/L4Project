          "description":"Developing insects will cause the leaves to turn brown and wither. Since galls are so difficult to see, try and spot leaves that have browned to check for wasp and mite activity. Another way to look out for oak mites is to see if there are small insects hovering around an oak tree. Swarms can be a few feet off the ground or as high as 20\u201330 feet (6.1\u20139.1 m) in the air. If the brown leaves have a crusty edge to them, it\u2019s a sign that mite activity could be present. You\u2019ll start to see these swarms in September, but they are around during sunsets throughout the summer as well."

          "description":"As summer turns into fall, the galls where the young oak mites eat the wasp larvae break open and release the mites into the air. A stiff breeze can also blow the mites off the tree, at which point they can get into your clothing and start biting you. Towards the end of summer, the mite population can be very large, with as many as 300,000 mites falling from each tree every day. If possible, wear tight clothing when working outside to keep the mites away from your skin. Bites primarily occur on a person\u2019s upper body or wherever clothing is loose. You can also wear a hooded jacket to cover the back of your neck while working outside."

These \u201cmite showers\u201d generally occur between August and October, so keep your house sealed off from the mites right before fall starts. Just having a screen in your window isn\u2019t enough to keep oak mites out because they\u2019re so tiny and they can slip through the gaps in the screen. Make sure every window is completely shut."

It is not necessary to remove the tree itself because the mites are not likely to be a problem every single year. The best way to make sure mites don\u2019t fall on you is to stay away from the bottom of oak trees."

          "description":"The bites are tiny, welt-like bumps that inflame your skin and become incredibly itchy. You can pick up an over-the-counter itch cream from your local drug store or order some online. Apply a dab of cream every day to each bump and let it sit. Use the cream until the bites are completely gone. Oak mite bites usually last about 2 weeks. Do not scratch your bites as this can lead to an infection."
