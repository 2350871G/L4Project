          "description":"If you want to make a sweeter crust that will balance the tartness of the filling, place 6 cups (1420 g) of a fruit flavored cereal in a plastic bag, and use a rolling pin, heavy can, or even your hands to crush it into approximately 3 cups (approximately 708 g) of fine crumbs. Fruit flavored cereal that works well for the crust include Trix, Fruit Loops, and Captain Crunch Crunch Berries. You can also make your own graham cracker or cookie crust by crushing the cookies."

Set the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (approximately 177 degrees Celsius), and allow it to preheat fully so it\u2019s hot when the crust is ready.

Mix the ingredients together with a spoon until they are thoroughly combined. The mixture will be coarse and almost sandy when the ingredients are fully mixed.
