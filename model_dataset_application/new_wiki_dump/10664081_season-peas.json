Pour the peas into the water and reduce the heat to a simmer, then let the peas cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until they are tender. Some cooks warn that adding salt to the water before boiling can toughen the peas and slow down the cooking process. Others claim that salt may actually reduce cooking time by causing the water to boil hotter. It can also impart a little flavor to the peas. If you\u2019d like to experiment with salt, try adding about \u00bd to 1 teaspoon (2.5 to 5 grams) of salt per 1 US quart (0.95 L) of water before boiling. If you wish, you can add a pinch of sugar to the water to enhance the sweetness of the peas."

Gently stir the peas and spices with a spatula to distribute the salt and pepper evenly and prevent burning. If you like, you can add some aromatics (such as minced garlic or shallots) to the butter and let them soften slightly before adding the peas. Since the peas are already cooked, you don\u2019t need to saut\u00e9 them for more than a minute or 2."

Add just a small spoonful to be sure you don\u2019t overwhelm the peas, and increase the amount if you want more punch. For maximum flavor, bruise the herbs slightly with your fingers before adding them to the dish, and add them right before you take the peas off the heat. Add sweeter herbs like mint to bring out the natural sweetness of the peas. For a more savory flavor, try parsley, basil, sage, or rosemary. If you use an herb with a stronger flavor, such as rosemary, add it earlier in the cooking process (e.g., when you first start melting the butter) to soften the flavor."

When you are ready to serve up your peas, add a little of the dried seasoning of your choice to taste. A few good options include marjoram, paprika, turmeric, dill, cilantro, oregano, mustard, savory, allspice, thyme, and caraway. You can also flavor your peas by drizzling on some white vinegar or lemon juice, a dressing (such as vinaigrette), or a flavorful oil, like sesame or olive oil."
