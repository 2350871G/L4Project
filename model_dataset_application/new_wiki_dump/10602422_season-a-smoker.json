          "headline":"Use mild dish soap and water to clean the interior of the smoker.",
          "description":"Dip a sponge into warm water and mild soap and use it to wipe down the racks, grates, pans, and interior surfaces of the grill. This will get rid of any grime, oil, or harmful substances that got onto your smoker during manufacturing. Once you\u2019re done, rinse off the soapy residue with water. Don\u2019t scrub the smoker with too much force; you may accidentally scratch the surface. You can also use water by itself to clean the interior of your smoker, if you\u2019re nervous about using dish soap. However, dish soap does a much better job of removing grease that may be on the inner surface of the grill."

        {
          "headline":"Let the smoker air dry, then coat the interior surface with cooking oil.",
          "description":"Take the chip tray, grease tray, and water pan out of the smoker first, since you don\u2019t need to put oil on these. Make sure you use an oil with a high smoke point, so that the smoke leaves behind a fine black coating on the smoker that will help keep rust from forming on the interior. Try using vegetable oil, peanut oil, or canola oil for the best results. It should take around 2-3 hours for your smoker to completely dry. Don\u2019t put so much oil in the smoker that the inside is dripping. Simply give the interior surface a light coating. Use a spray bottle or a small amount of oil on a cloth to apply the oil onto the interior surface of the smoker."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Open the top vent and put the accessories back inside the smoker.",
          "description":"Having the top vent open is very important, since it enables the smoker to burn properly by ensuring there\u2019s enough air moving through the interior. Although filling the water pan with water is necessary when you actually cook with your smoker, you don\u2019t have to fill it during the seasoning process. Having the accessories, such as the grilling racks, grates, and water pan, inside the smoker when you season it will ensure that these components are fully sanitized before you cook with them. If you want to give foods cooked in your smoker a stronger flavor, consider filling the water pan with a flavorful juice or beer."

          "headline":"Set the temperature on the smoker to 275 \u00b0F (135 \u00b0C) and let it run for 2 hours.",
          "description":"Make sure the smoker is plugged in if it\u2019s electric or hooked up to a gas tank if it it\u2019s a gas smoker. Wait for the smoker to reach 275 \u00b0F (135 \u00b0C) before you start the 2-hour run time. It should take about 15 minutes for your grill to reach this temperature. Make sure you turn off your grill after 3 hours have passed."

          "headline":"Add wood chips to your smoker and run it for another hour.",
          "description":"Putting wood in the wood chips tray during the last hour of the seasoning process will ensure that the interior of the smoker is completely sanitized and will also give it a nice woody flavor. The tray is typically located on the side of the smoker on most models. You\u2019ll only need to use about a handful of wood chips during the seasoning process. There\u2019s no particular type of wood chip that you should use for seasoning your smoker, other than whatever flavor you prefer. Any type of wood chip will work for sanitizing the grill\u2019s interior. You can buy these wood chips at any retailer that sells grilling equipment. 2 of the more common types of wood chips used when seasoning a smoker are mesquite-flavored and maple-flavored."

If the internal temperature of the smoker doesn\u2019t reach 275 \u00b0F (135 \u00b0C), you may need to add more charcoal to the firebox or clean out the vent to make sure enough air is getting to the coals. The charcoal should burn itself out after 3 hours. However, if the smoker is still burning after 3 hours, simply close the top vent to starve the charcoal of oxygen and put out the fire."
