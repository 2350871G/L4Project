If you feel a lot of roughness or surface blemishes, use 220 grit sandpaper to sand it to your desired smoothness. Roughness and blemishes will show through applied cooper leaf. Unless you are going for a rustic look, you\u2019ll want to smooth these areas out first. Canvas, wood, Masonite, paper, glass, plastic, metal and any other surface that can be made non-absorbent can be used for copper leafing. Put down newspaper to protect the work area and floor as you work."

Common options for primer are gesso and various kinds of paint (acrylic, casein, egg tempura, latex, house, oil). Apply the primer slowly and carefully, since any brush strokes you leave behind will show through the copper leaf once it\u2019s applied. Priming the surface makes it smooth and non-absorbent, both of which are necessary prior to copper leafing it. If you plan to burnish the surface, it must be made absolutely smooth first. Burnishing is when you polish metallic leaf until it's very shiny. Consider using a burnish primer created specifically for this process."

Applying a base color, or undercolor, can help enhance the finished look by slightly changing the overall color tone. Red, grey and ochre are popular choices for bole. After applying the bole, allow it to dry completely before moving on to the size application. A deep red bole can add warmth to the final look. Black and grey can create a colder, \u201chard\u201d tone. Yellow ochre can even out the surface appearance and help to disguise cracks or blemishes."
