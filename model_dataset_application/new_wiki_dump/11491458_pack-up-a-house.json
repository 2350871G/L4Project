          "description":"Packing up even a small house requires a lot of time and labor. Make an effort to begin cleaning, sorting, and filling your first boxes well before you\u2019re actually scheduled to be out of your home. If you wait any longer than that, you could find yourself in a crunch, which will only make the situation even more stressful. If you\u2019ve already been given the go-ahead to move into your new residence, get a head start and drop off a box or two every couple of days. Before you know it, you\u2019ll have transitioned most of your belongings without having to carve out a huge chunk of time. Since clearing out a house is such a time-consuming project, it\u2019s much easier to tackle it a little at a time than to try to get it all done in a single weekend."

          "description":"Before you get down to the nitty-gritty packing tasks, go around and set aside anything that you don\u2019t plan on taking with you for donation or disposal. This includes old and worn out belongings, of course, but may also apply to things like furniture, appliances, and decor items you no longer have a use for. Separate smaller items into piles based on whether you plan on selling, consigning, or trashing them. For large pieces, it will help to rent a construction dumpster with a scheduled pick-up date or hire a haul-away service. The more stuff you part with now, the less you\u2019ll have to take to your new home."

Only accept boxes that are in good condition\u2014they should be free of holes, tears, and creases, and still have all of their original flaps intact. Steer clear of boxes showing signs of rotting or water damage. You may also have some luck finding free boxes in bulk on community message boards or sites like Craigslist or U-haul Box Exchange. Lidded plastic and rubber storage containers are also useful for transporting small and medium-sized items, particularly fragile ones that are at a higher risk of breaking in an ordinary cardboard box."

          "headline":"Set up a dedicated packing station in one room of your home.",
          "description":"In addition to boxes, bags, and other storage solutions, your packing station should include a ready supply of packing tape, bubble wrap, permanent markers, and other packing necessities. You can then simply bring your things to one central place as you determine the best order to box them up in. Pile completed boxes in one corner to keep them all together until you\u2019re ready to load them up. Trying to drag your packing supplies with you from room to room won\u2019t just slow you down, it will also clutter up multiple rooms and make it harder to remember where you are in the process. By the same token, you may also want to have a special \u201cno-pack zone\u201d where you keep jewelry, family photos, handmade art, financial documents, and other important or sentimental items that you don\u2019t want to risk losing or breaking in the move."

Once the time comes to start packing, put them in plainly-labelled boxes so you\u2019ll know which ones to unload first. These will be your \u201cfirst on, last off\u201d items. If you\u2019re not sure what to pack and what to put off, think about the kinds of things that you use on a daily basis: personal hygiene products, cookware, the coffee pot, your laptop, your toothbrush, etc.Tip: Consider packing everyday essentials like clothes, dining ware, and toiletries in open crates, plastic storage containers, or hampers for easier access."

          "description":"Scribbling on moving boxes with a permanent marker is the time-honored method of facilitating the packing process. However, you could also take a more sophisticated approach, such as numbering your boxes to correspond to an itemized master packing list, or creating color-coded labels that indicate where the contents of each box belongs in your new home. If you decide to simply label your boxes, be sure to write on at least two sides (not the top). This will allow you to identify them at a glance without being forced to reposition them in a teetering pile or crowded moving truck. Whatever method you decide to go with, it should be clear and efficient, and, above all, make sense to you."

Instead, leave all but the heaviest items inside these pieces and load them up as-is. That way, you\u2019ll only have to worry about relocating the piece itself and not its contents. Wrap large pieces of furniture with plastic wrap to keep drawers shut and prevent a piece\u2019s weight from shifting unexpectedly. The only time moving a full piece of furniture or storage accessory may not be a good idea is when it\u2019s so overstuffed or cumbersome that it poses as safety risk to you or your moving crew.Warning: If you plan on working with a professional moving service, be aware that some companies may not be willing to move furniture that still has things in it."

You can find wardrobe boxes for around $10-20 apiece at most home goods stores and home improvement centers. This price may seem steep for a single storage solution, but it\u2019s one that has the potential to make your life a lot easier.
