Use a directory or other drop ship source such as Worldwide Brands, Doba or SimpleSource - they do the work of finding legitimate suppliers for you. Watch out for scammers who pose as suppliers but are really just middlemen themselves. They'll take their own cut of the profits, thus reducing yours. If they require a regular fee for using their service, consider that a very bright red flag!"

You'll also want to find out if they'll put a custom return label (with your store name and address) on the shipments, so that the customers assume you sent it. Don't be surprised if the supplier you contact  for a retail account requests a tax ID. In order to purchase products at a wholesale cost, many will require this information."

For better results, provide your own descriptions and pictures of the product you're selling (if you have samples). The price should be low enough to compete against similar items, but high enough to give you a good profit, once you account for listing fees.
