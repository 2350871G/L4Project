Major cattle used for human beef consumption include Angus, Hereford, Charolais, and Brahman. The Angus cow is famous for being from Scotland and is seen on many a cattle ranch. One of the most commonly raised cattle in the United States is the Hereford cow. The Hereford cow is known for producing well marbled meat much akin to the Black Angus cow. Charolais cattle are primarily used to breed larger calves. A Charolais bull is often crossed with a Hereford cow to produce a larger calf leading to higher beef yield. Brahman cattle are akin to wild cattle and are rarely used in US ranching. [Personal interview with cattle rancher who wishes to remain anonymous]"
