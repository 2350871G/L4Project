          "description":"Attach drywall or gypsum wallboard panels to interior exposed ICF walls using drywall screws. Cover the drywall or wallboard panels with 3 thin coats of joint compound, letting each coat dry for 24 hours before applying the next. Paint the walls 24 hours after applying the last coat of compound.Both drywall and gypsum wallboard will produce the same finish on your interior ICF walls. They are essentially just different names for the same type of product. This type of paneling is also known as sheetrock, wallboard, or plasterboard. This is also one of the most affordable interior finishes you can choose."

          "description":"Nail 1 in (2.5 cm) by 2 in (5.1 cm) horizontal furring strips into the ICF walls at 16 in (41 cm) intervals. Cut wood tongue and groove panels to the height of the wall, then nail them to the furring strips, interlocking the tongues and grooves as you install the panels.You can purchase unfinished wood tongue and groove paneling or prefinished paneling. If you choose unfinished paneling, you can leave it as-is for a natural wood look. You could also paint or stain unfinished wood paneling to achieve the final appearance you want. A tongue and groove finish is more expensive than a drywall or gypsum wallboard finish in terms of the cost of materials. However, it tends to cost less in terms of labor because you don\u2019t need to apply multiple coats of joint compound to the wall."

          "description":"Choose a fine-textured acrylic plaster or stucco if you want a smoother texture or a coarse-textured stucco or plaster if you want a more pronounced texture. Apply 2 coats of the plaster or stucco directly on top of the insulating foam using a trowel, smoothing it out and letting it dry between coats.Tip: Stuccoed or plastered walls can give a room a kind of vintage Mediterranean vibe. Combine them with stone or tile floors and exposed wood beams to complete the look. You can get acrylic stucco and plaster with pigment in it if you know you want the wall to be a certain color. Otherwise, you can use white plaster or stucco, which can always be painted over later. A plaster or stucco finish is the most expensive and labor-intensive interior finish you can choose."

If you use real wood siding, make sure to paint or stain it to protect against weathering and make it last longer. If you want to use an artificial timber-style siding, keep in mind that hardboard siding is more durable than vinyl siding, but costs more. It also requires maintenance every 5-10 years, whereas vinyl siding requires no maintenance."

For instance, you could use a stucco with a pebble aggregate to create a pebbled look or a stucco with a sand aggregate for a fine-grained texture.
