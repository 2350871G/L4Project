  "text":" Setting Things Up Mark a square patch of lawn for your bowling green. The patch should be relatively flat and each side must measure between 37 and 44 yards (34 and 40 meters). This bowling green should also be divided into six equal sections, called rinks. Create a shallow ditch with a bank around the bowling green. The ditch defines the end of the green. Surround the outside of the ditch with a bank. The bank should be about 9 inches (23 cm) (230 mm) higher than the level of the bowling green. Place a boundary marker at the end of each rink. A pin should be placed at the center of each rink, and each pin should be numbered according to the rink number. The numbering system goes from one through six. Note that these pins are not the target. They merely exist to set the boundary of the rink. Playing a Simple Game Separate into teams. Teams can consist of individuals, pairs, three players, or four players. Regardless of how many players you have, you need to separate the players into two equal teams. Each team should also have a leader. Deliver the jack. The jack is a small white ball that is rolled to establish the target. A coin is tossed to determine which team's leader will roll the jack. That person must stand on a mat at one end of a rink and roll the jack down the rink. The jack must travel at least 25 yards (23 meters) but should not roll past the boundary pin. Center the jack. Move the jack to the center of the rink, keeping it even with the same length it rolled to. Take turns rolling the lawn bowls. Lawn bowls are balls are made of hard plastic and range in size from 4.5 inches (11.4 cm) to 5 inches (12.7 cm) (116 mm to 131 mm). The weight should not exceed 3.5 lbs (1.59 kg).

The lawn bowl must be rolled within the rink and players should aim for the target jack. Count the shots. A shot is a lawn bowl that was delivered closer to the jack than the opposing team's bowls. For instance, if Team A delivered three bowls far away from the jack and further away from Team B's bowls, but delivered one bowl directly next to the jack, closer than any of Team B's bowls, Team A has one shot and Team B has zero. Reverse the direction. Stand at the opposite end of the rink and repeat the jack delivery, lawn bowl delivery, and counting of shots. This completes an end. Tally up the shots. There are two methods of deciding when a game is complete. In the first, the game ends when one team reaches 21 points. In the second, the game ends after 18 or 21 ends are played, and the victor is whoever had the highest score. Types of Lawn Bowl Deliveries Use a drawing shot. A drawing shot is the most common. Essentially, you aim to get the lawn bowl near the jack without bumping into anything. Roll the bowl to the right of the jack, allowing the bowl to curve in to the left. This curving is due to the fact that a lawn bowl is not a perfect sphere. Lawn bowls are shaved on one side, causing them to curve as they roll. You can also have a backhand draw by turning the bowl over and curving it in the opposite direction. Aim to the left of the jack, directing the bowl to curve to the right. Try a yard on.

The bowl should knock into the jack and drag it 1 or 2 yards (1 or 2 meters) away from its initial location. This delivery is used to move the jack away from the opponent's bowls and toward your own. Attempt a running shot. A running shot is similar to a yard on in that it requires force to change the position of another object. Usually, the goal is to move an opponent's bowl away from the jack. The shot is also used on occasion to push the jack toward the ditch without causing it to tip into it. Use a drive. A drive shot requires a roll that has so much speed and force that it hits an opponent's bowl or the jack with full force. As a result, the target is removed from play, meaning that an opponent's bowl is either pushed out of the rink or that a jack is pushed into the ditch. Using it to destroy an opponent's bowl does not destroy the end, but using it to push the jack out of the rink does destroy the end.",
