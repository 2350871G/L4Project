  "text":" Making the Dough Sift the flour.  Mix the sifted flour and salt in a large bowl.  Blend in the solid butter or lard with your fingers (best to crosscut with two sharp knives) until it breaks up. The flour mixture should have an even, coarse texture. The butter lumps should be no larger than the size of a pea. Beat together the eggs, water, and vinegar in a bowl. Add to the flour mixture and mix. Place the mixture on a floured surface. Knead with the heel of your hand to bring the dough together. Cover  the dough and allow to sit in a cool place for at least an hour.  Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 of an inch (0.3 cm) thick. Cut into circles about 4-6 inches (10 - 15 cm) in diameter and lightly flour them. Making the Filling Heat some oil in a large saucepan. Mince the onions and garlic, and add to the pan. Cook until the onions become translucent. Add the ground meat. Break it up with a spoon and cook, stirring until lightly browned. Drain off fat. Mix in the cumin, chili powder, and sugar.  Chop the hard-boiled eggs and halve the stuffed olives. Carefully mix into the meat mixture. Add salt and pepper to taste. Preparing and Baking the Empanadas Preheat the oven to 400\u00baF/200\u00baC.  Stuff the empanada dough wrappers. Place 2\u20133 tablespoons (29.6\u201344.4 ml) of the filling in the center of each wrapper. Dampen the outer perimeter of the dough. Fold over, forming a semicircle. Pinch a corner of the dough, and then fold that section onto itself. Pinch and pull out another 1/2-inch (1.2 cm) section and fold over, so it slightly overlaps the first piece. Repeat along the length of the folded side, until you create a braided or twisted seal. Place the folded empanadas on a greased cookie sheet. Bake 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown. Finished. ",
