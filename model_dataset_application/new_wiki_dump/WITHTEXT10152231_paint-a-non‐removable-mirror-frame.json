Try not to be too rough with the rag as you don't want to damage the frame. For best results, dab your cloth with a few drops of white vinegar or window cleaning spray before you wipe the frame. Vinegar is especially good at removing rust from metal frames. Don't use vinegar on plastic as it may dissolve the material. Avoid using wax sprays and other cleaning products as they might prevent the primer and paint from sticking to the your frame."
