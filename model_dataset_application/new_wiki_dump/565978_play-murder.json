For example, have everyone stand in a circle and close their eyes. The person sitting out can then tap someone on the shoulder and that person will be the murderer. To use a deck of cards, use all non-face cards except one. The person who draws the face card will then be the murderer. The same can be done with slips of paper. Gather as many slips as you have players and keep them all blank except one. On one piece of paper draw an X, then whoever gets this piece of paper is the murderer."
