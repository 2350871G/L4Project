The complimentary colors could be a few shades lighter or darker from \"cream, brown and green\" such as champagne, ivory, beige and pastel green. Stay away from harsh colors or any color that heavily contrast other colors, unless you are aiming for contrast for a particular feature or reason."

It might be a very elaborately framed mirror, an eye-catching painting, an unusual couch, a wall of pictures.

Keep magazines in an opaque holder where one can easily access them on the sofa but you can only see the number of magazines when you look from the top. On your make-up table, only display favourite perfumes and gather all your cosmetics into a basket. The idea is that you have easy access but maintain a unified, simple look. Choose cabinets, bins, or baskets that cover and contain. If you choose glass cabinets, plan to keep the contents in order. Clutter only interrupts the flow of the space."

Those belong to corporate offices where there is a very sharp, 'switched on' feel as opposed to a relaxed, cosy, warm environment. The key is stringent selection. Depending on the space you have, select a couple of favourite things that gives you great memories or might be a lovely conversation-starter\u2014things that you'll love to share with others. Perhaps you might display a beautiful vase of freshly-picked flowers in your garden that might be the centre piece of your dining table, some unique treasures collected on your travels, or works of art that you or a friend have done."

Pay attention to rubbish\u2014never leave it till it's overflowing. If you cook a lot, ensure that the smells don't stay and spill out to the other rooms and keep your home smelling nice. Avoid getting stains and remove the ones you get. With clutter out of the way, you will be wonderfully surprised how much easier housework and maintenance gets."
