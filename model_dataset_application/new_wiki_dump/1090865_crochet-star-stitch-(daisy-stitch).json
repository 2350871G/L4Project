The star stitch looks a bit complicated at first, but if you read all the way through the instructions you'll find that it is fun and easy to make. The star stitch is in multiples of two, adding five to the beginning chain. Using a G hook and worsted weight yarn (#4), two star stitches should equal 1 inch. Chain the length you desire in even number of chains, adding five extra chains at the end. Ex. : If your project needs to equal 10\" in width you would need to crochet 20 chains plus 5 extra chains for a total of 25 chain stitches. Work the foundation row (first row) according to the following steps:  Keeping all loops on hook, insert hook in the second stitch (chain) from hook, yarn over and pull a loop through (There should now be 2 loops on hook). Insert the hook in the next stitch of the chain, yarn over, and pull a loop through and repeat twice. There should now be 5 loops on the hook. Yarn over and pull through all five loops on hook at the same time, ch 1 (ch 1 is considered the \"eye\" of the star stitch).

SC in the eye of next star stitch, working over 2 strands, SC in top of same star stitch and repeat across the row. SC in turning chain and turn. Complete the third row: Start with Ch2, keeping all loops on hook. Insert hook in the 2nd stitch from hook, and pull a loop through. Insert hook in the next SC, pull a loop through, and repeat from twice. There should now be 5 loops on hook. Yarn over and pull through all 5 loops at one time, ch 1 (star made).
