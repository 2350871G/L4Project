          "description":"All competitive video games have a wide variety of video content online, through gaming platforms, and on television. Take a look at some videos of professionals playing to get an idea of what game titles look interesting. If you plan on being a professional esports competitor, this will also give you an idea of the kind of content you will need to create. There are several of live-streaming websites that focus on competitive video games. The most widely used are Twitch, Azubu, and MLG. Individual esports competitors almost always have their own live-stream channel and YouTube channel. These are also great video resources you should check out."

You want to make sure that you really enjoy the game and feel relatively confident in your skills before deciding which one you will start playing professionally. You can always get better at a game with more practice, but if you find you are getting bored, you should probably move on to a different game."

Some games will only be available on certain platforms, or might be exclusive to a single console brand or personal computer. Budget matters when selecting your platform. Nintendo is generally the least expensive gaming platform to purchase. Xbox and PlayStation are typically similar in price. Building a personal computer can vary widely in price depending on the parts you want and if you are able to build it yourself."

Scheduling your practice hours will help you stay committed and consistent. You should even write a list of areas you need to work on and pick specific times to focus on them. As you develop your skills, you should seek out other players who are skilled to play with and against.
