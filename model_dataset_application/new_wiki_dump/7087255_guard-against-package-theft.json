There are many types of lockboxes available. Search online for all your options. Some lockboxes have an access code that you give to the driver. Once the driver closes the box, the code changes and only you can access it. Other lockboxes close automatically when a package arrives, so the delivery driver doesn\u2019t have to do anything extra. Low-tech lockboxes just have a normal key lock. Leave instructions for the driver to close the lock when they leave. Lockboxes come in different sizes. If you have a large package coming, it may not fit in the lockbox."

This way, packages won\u2019t be on your porch while you\u2019re not home. Keep in mind that delivery services might stop delivering the package if they miss you a few times.

Ask them to look out the window every so often and if they see a package, to bring it into their home. If you\u2019ve signed up for delivery alerts, call your neighbor when the package is delivered and ask them to bring the package into their home. You can also instruct the driver to leave the package with your neighbor if they don\u2019t get an answer at your door. Remember to give them the correct address for your neighbor. Ask your neighbor if this is okay beforehand and don\u2019t tell the driver to bring the package there without your neighbor\u2019s permission."

That way, thieves won\u2019t see a package on your porch. If you have a pet, make sure they aren\u2019t outside when the delivery driver comes. Make sure the driver closed the gate before letting your pet outside. This isn't a flawless method because some thieves follow delivery trucks around. It does, however, guard against thieves who drive around neighborhoods after deliveries are made. Even if porch pirates do know there's a package in your backyard, they may be less likely to enter your yard for fear of looking suspicious."

Many modern cameras transmit to your phone so you can check the feed at any time. If you don\u2019t have the money for a camera system, try installing unconnected cameras.

This means you\u2019re more likely to catch a thief\u2019s face if your package is stolen. These cameras are usually not visible, so they probably won\u2019t deter thieves who can\u2019t see them. But with a doorbell camera, you\u2019ll at least have video evidence of a person taking your package. This can help authorities find the person and serve as evidence if you file an insurance claim.
