          "description":"Use a vegetable brush to scrub the yams to remove dirt and roots. Rinse the yams under cool running water. Do not peel them yet; you will do that after you cook them. Because of this, it's important that the yams are clean. Take a look at the yams to make sure they are fresh. Use a paring knife to slice off any bruised or black spots. Leaving the peels on will help the yams cook evenly while keeping the flesh intact. If you'd prefer to peel the yams first, your candied yams will taste delicious but won't have a firm texture."

You will have enough glaze to make very sweet, sticky candied yams. If you'd prefer, use only half of the glaze to keep the dish from being too sweet. Don't overmix the yams and the glaze. The soft-cooked yams will fall apart if you stir too much."
