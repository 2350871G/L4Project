  "text":" Prepare the Dough Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) while you line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.  Combine all of the ingredients for the gluten-free flour mix in a mixing bowl, using a whisk.  Mix 2 tablespoons of sesame seeds, the anise seeds, 10 tablespoons (150 ml) of gluten-free flour mix, brown sugar and baking powder in another bowl, stirring with a whisk.  Whisk together the egg white, olive oil, vanilla extract and salt in a separate bowl.  Push the dry ingredients against the side of the bowl, creating a well in the center.  Pour the wet ingredients into the well and mix them with a wooden spoon until they are well combined. The key is to incorporate the ingredients gradually. Shape and Bake the Cookies Scoop the dough from the bowl using a tablespoon.  Shape the dough into logs using clean hands. The logs should be about 1-1/2\u201d (4 cm) long and 3/4\u201d (2 cm) thick. Spread the remaining 4 tablespoons (59.1 ml) of sesame seeds onto a plate.  Roll the logs in the sesame seeds and place the logs onto the baking sheet. Leave at least 1\u201d (2-1/2 cm) of space around each log. Bake 1 sheet of cookies for 15 to 20 minutes, until the cookies are slightly golden and firm to the touch.
