This means shifting and changing things to suit your needs. Most often, as pretty as it is, for the sake of a good painting, you will be required to shuffle things around on your paper.

This could be a completely fictional happenstance, but the addition of animals  is indescribable. Sketching the Design Make a sketch on your good paper. A pad of #140 cold press watercolor paper is good to use in that it has a cardboard backing to function as your support as you paint. Start with the focal point figure, be it a tree or whatever. Establish it right off the bat. Wet your pads of color in your paint set. Lay out your favorite brushes for easy grabbing as you work. A medium round, a half in flat, a wash brush and a tiny detailer brush are typically used. Of course, additional brushes are fun to add varied textures. Have a pencil, eraser, and a torn piece of natural sponge for doing foliage. Put your water vessel close at hand. Have all supplies on a small table or the seat of a chair within easy reach of your dominant hand. Paint the main element right away. Let it dry. Outdoors you might find the paint drying fast, depending of the humidity in the air. Adding Details Sketch in pencil the shapes for the flowers, flagstones, grassy areas, etc. Actually break the areas into jig-saw like shapes. Here is where you might take off from reality and add flowers of your choosing. Paint each section of flowers, one at a time. Watch your painting grow and extend out as you paint each section. Remember to contrast heights and shapes of plants from one area to the next. Clarify each section of flowers by doing a small, quick sketch.  Return to the main element and flesh it out. Add shadows along each branch, textures, more branches and twigs. Do the foliage by sponging on the color for the leaf clusters. Use a dampened, squeezed out natural sponge dipped in undiluted paint. Twist and turn your wrist as you dab on the foliage for variety. Immediately go back in with a water filled brush and spread and break up the strong texture made by the sponge. (A small spray bottle filled with clean water would do a similar job.) Allow this to dry. Then return with the sponge and accent areas that need it. Try to make it look like it is not a sponge job. Fill in areas behind the main figure. Pale blue is always good and looks like sky. Think about adding a large, green pine tree to fill some of the space and add another interesting, triangular shape. Finishing Up When complete, set it away from yourself. As it dries, look at it. If it needs pulling together, do that, carefully, but avoid completely outlining shapes.
