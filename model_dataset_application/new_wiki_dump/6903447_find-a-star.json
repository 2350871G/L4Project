Latitude refers to the parallel lines that run east and west around the globe. The higher a latitude\u2019s number is, the further away from the Equator a location is. Longitude refers to the vertical lines that run north and south from the North to South Pole. They measure a location\u2019s distance from the Prime Meridian. The numbers for latitude go up to 90 degrees. 90 degrees north is near the North Pole, while 90 degrees south is in Antarctica. The Equator is equidistant between the 2 poles, and is 0 degrees. The numbers for longitude go from 0 to 180 degrees. They start at 0 at the Prime Meridian. The Prime Meridian is an arbitrary line that runs from the North to South pole through Europe and Africa."

The problem is, because the Earth rotates and moves, the location of celestial objects appears to move as well. When referencing locations of stars, you\u2019ll need to be able to cross-reference a star\u2019s right ascension (RA) and declination (DEC) relative to the Earth\u2019s longitude and latitude. It helps to imagine the celestial sphere as a giant bubble around Earth. There are globes that you can buy that map out major constellations and stars on a projection of the celestial sphere.

They\u2019re based on the celestial sphere, with the right ascension referring to the vertical lines that run from the North Celestial Pole to the South Celestial Pole. The lines that run perpendicular relative to the poles in the celestial sphere are the lines of declination. In other words, declination is a celestial version of longitude, and right ascension is the celestial version of latitude! The celestial poles and Equator are an extension of the Earth\u2019s Equator and poles. Like coordinates on Earth, the celestial coordinates are fixed positions. In other words, a specific star will always be located at the same coordinates, regardless of when you\u2019re trying to find it. The symbol for right ascension looks like a cursive lower-case A. The symbol for declination looks like a lower-case O with a bar on top."

          "description":"Because the Earth is constantly spinning, you use the right ascension to determine how long it will take for the Earth to rotate and face a star. There are 24 hours in a day, and the right ascension coordinates are given in units of time based on a day. For example, Polaris\u2019s RA is 2h 41m 39s. That means that it takes Polaris 2 hours, 41 minutes, and 39 seconds to come into view if you\u2019re starting at the location of the vernal equinox. The arbitrary starting point for RA is the location of the sun on the first day of spring. The location of this line changes every year, and it is called the vernal equinox. Think of this as the Prime Meridian on a celestial sphere. Right ascension is always measured going east. Each hour means that 1/24th of the Earth has been traveled. This corresponds to 15 degrees along the equator."

          "description":"If right ascension tells you when a star will appear, declination tells you where a star will be in the sky. Look up the declination for the star you want to find and check the first number listed, which is the only one you need to have a star. This number will be in degrees, and it will tell you how high or low a star in the sky will be relative to the equator. The + or \u2013 sign at the beginning of the declination number tells you whether the star is in the northern or southern hemisphere. The plus sign means that the star is in the northern hemisphere, while the minus sign means that the star is in the southern hemisphere. A star that has a declination starting in 0 sits directly above the equator. For example, Polaris has a DEC of +89\u00b0 15\u2032 50.8.\u2033 This means that Polaris is 89 degrees north of the equator."

If you live at 39 degrees north, and the declination of a star is +39, then it will pass directly overhead. Generally, a range of 45 degrees in either direction will be visible from your location at some point, so someone living at 39 degrees north will be able to find stars with DECs from +84 to -6.Tip: The further a star\u2019s declination is from your location, the closer to the horizon you will need to point a telescope."

You will be able to see stars in your night sky within a 3-hour window in either direction from this point. Because the Earth drifts through space as it spins, the celestial grid drifts (this is called precession), which means that you\u2019ll have to look up the differential on a given night by referring to a star map. For example, Detroit, Michigan is roughly 85\u00b0 west. This translates roughly to 5h 30m right ascension. This means, that if a star has a declination between +15 and +75 and an RA between 8h 30m and 2h 30m, it may be visible on a given night from Detroit. Generally speaking, you can see stars within a 3-hour window in either direction. This is because each hour translates to 15\u00b0, and your maximum range in either direction is 45 degrees."
