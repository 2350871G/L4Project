          "description":"Search your cabinets for a large-rimmed bowl or baking pan that is bigger than your ham to collect water as the ham thaws. Take your ham out of the freezer and leave it wrapped in the aluminum foil or packaging. If you\u2019re defrosting slices of ham, place them in an airtight bag. Set your ham in the pan or bowl.Tip: Keeping your ham wrapped will keep your fridge from reeking of salted meat while keeping other food smells out of your ham. This method takes the most time, but it\u2019s the best way to thaw ham safely and evenly."

          "description":"Open the fridge and place your pan or baking sheet inside. The time it takes for your ham to thaw entirely depends upon the weight of your ham. For smaller hams, leave them in your fridge for 4 hours for every 1 lb (0.45 kg) of ham. Larger hams require 6 hours per 1 lb (0.45 kg) of meat. For example, if you have a large 18 lb (8.2 kg) ham, multiply 18 by 6 to get 108 hours. This means that you\u2019ll need to leave your ham in the refrigerator for 4.5 days to fully thaw it. If you have slices of ham that you\u2019re thawing, you will likely be able to thaw them in 12-24 hours. You can leave an uncooked ham in the fridge for 1 day after it\u2019s thawed. You can leave a cooked ham in the fridge for up to 3 days after it\u2019s thawed."

          "description":"Take your ham out of the fridge and cut through it with a carving knife. If the knife moves effortlessly through the ham, it\u2019s fully thawed. If you thawed an uncooked ham, plan on cooking it immediately after you\u2019ve removed it. If you\u2019ve thawed a cooked ham, take it out of the refrigerator and remove the packaging before serving it. You can heat it if you\u2019d like, but cold ham is a delicious dish as well! If the ham isn\u2019t fully thawed, pop it back in the fridge and leave it for another 2-12 hours based on how frozen it is. Keep the bone after you\u2019ve finished eating a bone-in ham. It can be used to make a delicious broth! If your plans change, you can refreeze your ham if it hasn\u2019t spent more than 3 days in the fridge."

          "description":"Take your ham out of the freezer and remove it from its original packaging. Take a large plastic bag that your ham will fit into and open it at the top. Carefully transfer your ham into the bag and use both hands to press the air out before closing it. This method is much faster than thawing it in the fridge, but it requires a little more effort on your part. You also won\u2019t be able to refreeze the ham afterwards. If your ham is really big, it can be kind of a pain to find a bag big enough for it. Look for extra-large food storage bags in your grocery store to pick some up. If you\u2019re thawing sliced ham, you can thaw it in its original packaging so long as it\u2019s sealed and airtight. You can\u2019t thaw your ham under warm water. If you do, the outer layers of your ham may get warmer than 40 \u00b0F (4 \u00b0C), which is the minimum threshold for dangerous bacteria to grow in your meat."

Wait 45 seconds to give the water time to cool and place your pot into the sink. The thaw time is dependent upon the size of your ham. Thaw it for 30 minutes for every 1 pound (0.45 kg) of ham.Warning: The exterior of your ham cannot exceed 40 \u00b0F (4 \u00b0C), so you may need to chill water in your fridge or add ice to the pot to get the water temperature down if your tap isn\u2019t that cold. For example, if your ham is 12 lb (5.4 kg), multiply 12 by 30 to get 360 minutes. This means that you\u2019ll need to thaw a 12 lb (5.4 kg) ham for 6 hours in cold water.
