As the actual design: Cut strips of quality tape (in a complementary color) from the roll and apply to the bottle. For shapelier designs, use your scissors to round out the tape. As a paint stencil: If you plan to paint over the tape, you will have needed to select one paint color for your design and another color for the base. The design color will be the first coat you\u2019ve applied before adding the painter's tape. Be sure the tape is fully adhered to the bottle before painting; any slip will spoil the design. Then paint over the entire bottle, including over the tape (the tape protects the painted color underneath, producing the design from that layer).
