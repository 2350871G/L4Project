A Senior Vice President of a company may require a more formal closing (\"Sincerely\") than the Sales Representative you play basketball with (\"Cheers\"). Consider the purpose of the letter. A company memo introducing new policies will deem a more formal closing than a note of congratulations to a colleague who was recently promoted (\"All best\"). Try using something like \"best regards,\" or \"best wishes,\" if the recipient is your close contact. \"Yours sincerely\" is better reserved for when you know the recipient whereas \"Sincerely\" is typically used if you do not know the recipient."
