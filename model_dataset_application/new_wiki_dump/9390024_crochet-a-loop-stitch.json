Working the Loop Stitch Insert your hook into the stitch. Working the loop stitch is similar to single crochet, but with some variations. To get started, insert your hook into the second stitch from the hook. Loop the working yarn around your finger. After you insert the hook, take the working yarn and loop it around the index finger that is holding the crocheted piece, not the finger holding the hook. Only loop the yarn around your index finger one time and make sure to keep your finger behind the crocheted piece. Wrap the yarn around your finger so that it is snug but not too tight. Hook the base of the loop in two places and pull through. Use the crochet hook to grab the yarn that is extending from the stitch and then grab the other side of the loop at its base. Pull through the stitch slightly, but do not release the loop from your finger. Loop the yarn over the hook and pull through again. With the base of the loop pulled through the stitch, loop the yarn over and then pull this new loop through both of the loops on your hook. This will secure the loop you just made, so you can pull your finger out of the loop now and it will stay put. Repeat to the end of the row.
