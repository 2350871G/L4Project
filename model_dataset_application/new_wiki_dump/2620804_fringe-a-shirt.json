Keep in mind that depending on how high you cut the fringe, you may be exposing your stomach. Some people like this look, while others prefer for the fringe to start around the waist of their pants or shorts."

          "headline":"Measure the chalk line.",
          "description":"Lay the shirt down on a flat surface such as the floor or a table. Measure the distance from each armpit of the shirt to each end of your drawn chalk line. This will help determine if your line is straight and even on both sides. If the two measurements are different in length, measure again and mark the place needed to make the chalk line straight and even. Then lay your ruler across the shirt and redraw the horizontal chalk line, connecting the two even measurements. For example, if the chalk line to the left side armpit measures 7 inches (17.8 cm), and the chalk line to the right side armpit measures 5 inches (12.7 cm), determine which length you rather have. Measure and mark the corresponding length on the side of the shirt you\u2019re adjusting. Once both ends of the chalk line are equidistant from the armpits, connect the two markings to even out your chalk line. This line will be where you stop cutting the strips of fringe."

          "headline":"Mark your fringe lines.",
          "description":"Lay your ruler on the drawn chalk line and use your chalk to mark \u00bd inch intervals where your strips will be cut. Once you finish marking the top of the shirt, lay your ruler on the bottom of the shirt and again, mark out \u00bd inch intervals where you are going to cut your fringe strips. Then, lay your ruler vertically on the shirt, and connect the \u00bd inch marks. This will give a clear line on which to cut your fringe. You could also free cut your strips without marking lines to cut along, but cutting along measured lines will make your shirt look less sloppy. If you plan to thread beads onto the fringe, thinner strips will allow the beads to slide onto the fringe strips more easily."

          "description":"Cut the bottom hem off of your shirt, right above the top stitching. Use your scissors to cut along the vertical \u00bd lines you measured for your fringe. You can cut both sides of the shirt at once. Just be sure that both the front and back of the shirt are spread out and flat when you start cutting. Stop cutting once you get to the top chalk line. The first and last strip you cut will be on the sides of the shirt. That means that the side strips will actually be an inch thick since it\u2019s a \u00bd inch on the front of the shirt connected to \u00bd inch on the back of the shirt. Cut these thicker 1 inch (2.5 cm) strips in half down the middle, to make them the same as the rest of your fringe strips."

Use your other hand to tug on the bottom of the strips, to curl in the cut sides and make the strips look more like fringe. You can leave your shirt as it is for a basic fringe top, or you can further embellish your shirt even more unique look."

You can add beads to a plain fringed shirt, a shirt with crisscross knots, and staggered fringe shirts. It\u2019s all about personal preference. Experiment to see which look you like best."
