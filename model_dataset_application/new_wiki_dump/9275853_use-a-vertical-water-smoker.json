Slide a piece of newspaper under the chimney starter and fill the starter to the brim with charcoal. Use a long lighter to light the newspaper under the starter, which will ignite the charcoal. Let the charcoal burn for 10-20 minutes. Use a pair of grilling mitts to grab the handle on the chimney starter when you're ready to dump the charcoal out. Dump the charcoal on the grate at the bottom of the smoker."

If your smoker doesn\u2019t have a built-in thermometer, stick a cooking thermometer through one of the vents in the side of the smoker to check the temperature. Check the temperature every 30 minutes to make sure it\u2019s staying in the right range. If the smoker is too hot, try shutting the vents and adding ice cubes to the water bowl.
