Fold over one corner. Take one corner of the towel over about two-thirds of the way across the short side of the towel. Create a crease down the length of the towel. Fold over the other corner. Take the other corner to create a layer over the first third. This will create another crease down the length of the towel. Your towel should now be long and skinny down the length of your body.

Folding Towels for a Narrow Shelf Fold the towel along its length. Grasp the corners of the short end of the towel and fold them together. This will create one crease down the length of the towel. The corners at the top and bottom of the towel will meet. This can be done while standing or lying the towel down on a flat surface. Fold the towel the opposite direction. Next, fold the towel in the opposite direction. To do this while standing, tuck the towel under your chin and pinch the towel halfway down the length of the towel. Then, let go of the towel with your chin and allow the towel to fall, creating a fold at the halfway point. Create thirds with the remainder of the towel. Bring the hemmed edge to the two-thirds mark and create a crease. Fold the last third of the towel. Layer the folded edge over the hemmed edge to create thirds.
