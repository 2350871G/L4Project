If you have children's DVDs and you do not mind the children sitting in the TV area, make them available by having them pre-loaded in your DVD player. Just let them look at the covers and choose what they want to watch from those."

Alternatively, you might like to set up a children's corner in your living room, covered by a blanket to create a boundary."
