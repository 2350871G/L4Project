          "description":"The thickest part of the steak is what has been cooked the least, so this is the best reading to take if you want to know if it\u2019s done. To do this, insert the thermometer into the side of the steak until it is in the thickest part of the meat (usually the center). If you are cooking steak on the bone, make sure the thermometer isn\u2019t touching the bone when you take the reading. Bone is an excellent heat conductor, so it\u2019s usually hotter than the rest of the meat. If you\u2019re not sure you\u2019re in the thickest part, try poking the thermometer all the way through to the other side first. As you pull it slowly back out, the temperature will rise as the tip of the thermometer enters the meat again, and then gradually drop as you get closer and closer to the center. The lowest temperature you see is the number you should go by."

People who prefer rare or medium rare steak sometimes enjoy their steak at a lower temperature, but they do this at their own risk. For a rare steak, aim for 125 \u00b0F (52 \u00b0C). For medium rare, aim for 135 \u00b0F (57 \u00b0C). For medium, aim for 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C). For medium well, aim for 150 \u00b0F (66 \u00b0C).

Although it is true that you will lose some juice from the steak where you make the cut, the loss is negligible because you are only nicking one small area of the steak. Remember that a steak continues to cook after you take it off the heat. So if you want your steak cooked to medium, take it off the heat when it looks medium rare inside.

For a medium rare steak, touch your thumb and middle finger and poke below your thumb. For medium touch your thumb and ring finger, and for well done touch your thumb and pinky finger. The finger test is not nearly as accurate as using a meat thermometer. In general, they are not as practical for a home cook as for a restaurant chef, who cooks many steaks one after another.
