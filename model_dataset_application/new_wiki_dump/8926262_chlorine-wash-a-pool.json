To test these levels, use a pool test strip. Just dip the strip into the water according to manufacturer directions and check the results. Typically, if the levels is off, the test strip will display a particular color. For instance, if the levels are normal, the test strip might show a blue color. If the levels are off, it might show a color like green or yellow. If any of your pool\u2019s chemical levels are off, apply the appropriate product (chlorine, bromine, or another product) in amounts that enable you to get your pool within the acceptable level. The amount of each product you\u2019ll need to maintain a chemically balanced pool depends on your pool\u2019s size and the amount of chemical product already in your pool. Consult the product instructions and/or your pool\u2019s owner manual to determine how much of each product you should use.

Consult your pool\u2019s user guide for directions regarding how to clean the pool filter. Generally, you\u2019ll need to turn the pump off and relieve the pressure in the filter.
