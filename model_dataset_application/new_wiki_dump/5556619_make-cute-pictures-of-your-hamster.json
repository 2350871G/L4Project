Make sure you carry your hamster in either a travel cage, a bucket that's safe, or anything else that your hamster could fit in and breathe if you are going outdoors. Try to avoid people walking dogs outdoors because the dog could try to bite the hamster or eat it, or even play with it which could suffocate your hamster if the dog steps on it.

Noon and afternoon would be also great, but it would usually be the sunniest and warmest which could harm hamsters as they cannot go in direct sunlight. The best time would be before noon, around 11:00 AM. Usually, the sun isn't so direct, and the light is perfect outdoors. Now for indoor pictures, noon would be the perfect time for you (unless your apartment/house window is facing the sun directly, then afternoon would do). Open up those curtains, let the sun shine across to the building in front of your house and the lighting wouldn't hurt your hamster nor be too dark."
