If you do choose to add a design, use glass suitable paint or markers to ensure that the design stays in place. Leave any design work to dry before proceeding to the next step. Any design added should be simple. The addition of the decorations and plant risks overwhelming a complex design."

It needs to be a plant that can tolerate slightly waterlogged soil as there is no drainage hole and it needs to be a plant that will tolerate the small growing space. (See \"Tips\" for a drainage hole suggestion.) This idea works best with succulent plants and cacti as they can tolerate a small, drier growing environment, appreciate misting and won't be hassled out when you transplant them."
