Test the drainage of the soil by watering it for 15 seconds, and then seeing how long it takes to drain. Well-draining soil should take about 15-30 seconds to get rid of the water. If the soil doesn\u2019t drain as quickly as it should, but you\u2019ve found a sunny spot, plant the seeds there. The warmth from the sun will help to evaporate excess water, and you can always water less if needed. Improve the drainage by tilling in organic matter, like compost or manure."

If you use fertilizer in your garden, you can also mix in a high-nitrogen fertilizer to encourage more growth. If you have soil that has a lot of clay or sand in it, mix peat moss and compost into the soil to increase nutrients and improve the soil.
