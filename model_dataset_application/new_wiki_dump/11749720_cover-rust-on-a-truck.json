          "description":"Use painter\u2019s or masking tape. Mark the border around the rusted area to keep the paint contained in that spot. If you paint over rust, the paint job won't last as long as if you ground all the rust away. It works well as a temporary fix, though."

          "headline":"Sand the area to remove loose rust.",
          "description":"While you don\u2019t have to grind away all the rust, you still have to remove the loose surface rust or the paint won't stick properly. Use 150-grit sandpaper and rub the rusted area with firm pressure until all the loose pieces come off. If you have an electric sander, this job will be easier. Otherwise, sand it by hand."

          "description":"Dip a clean rag into a can of paint thinner and scrub the area that you sanded to remove any leftover rust remnants. Wait for the moisture to dry before moving on. You could also use another weak solvent like mineral spirits to wipe the rust down. Wear goggles and gloves while working with solvents. If you get any paint thinner on your skin, rinse it off with cool water. If any gets in your eyes, flush your eye out with water for 15 minutes and then contact Poison Control. Don\u2019t use water to wipe down the truck. This could make the rusting worse."

          "headline":"Spray primer onto the rusted area.",
          "description":"Get a spray primer designed for use on auto bodies. Shake the can and hold it 6 inches (15 cm) from the truck. Spray it in a sweeping motion, making sure to stay within the tape border that you made. Continue until all the rusted parts are covered. Let the primer dry for 1 hour before moving on. You could also use a brush and roll-on type of primer. Since this is a quick fix, however, spray primer and paint is the best option. Always use spray paint in a well-ventilated area. Work outside or leave the garage door open."

          "description":"Use 400-600-grit sandpaper and rough up the primer a little. Sand lightly in a circular motion until the surface is slightly rough. This helps the paint stick better. If you have a power sander, don\u2019t use it for this step. The spot only needs a light sanding, so do it by hand."

Hold it 6 inches (15 cm) from the truck, and spray in a sweeping motion. When you\u2019ve covered the area, wait 20 minutes for the paint to dry before adding another coat. Match the spray paint to your truck\u2019s color as well as you can. The match probably won\u2019t be perfect, but it will cover the rust."

        {
          "headline":"Spray 2 more coats of paint to cover the rust completely.",
          "description":"After 20 minutes, apply the second coat the same way as the first one. Wait an additional 20 minutes and then cover the rust with the final coat. 3 coats should be enough to cover the rust, but check the paint job after the final coat dries. If some rust is still poking through or the area looks discolored, spray another coat."

Depending on how severe the rust was, a coverup with spray paint could last up to 2 years. After that, it will probably start bubbling up as the rust spreads."

They're mostly cosmetic features, but can also hide unsightly rust. You can purchase a set from an auto parts store or your truck manufacturer if they make custom flares. Just make sure to get a set made for your truck so they fit properly. Get large fender flares, if possible. These will keep the rust covered for longer after it starts spreading."

Reach into the wheel well, behind the flares, and feel for the locations of all the bolts holding them in position. Use a socket wrench to remove each bolt. Then, pull the flare towards you to pop it out of position. Some flares also have Christmas tree fasteners holding them in along with bolts. These are plastic clips that look like screws with teeth along the sides. If you find any of these, pull them straight out with pliers. If you\u2019re pulling but the flare is stuck, you may have missed a bolt. Stop pulling and look back into the wheel well for any other ones."

Look inside the wheel well with a flashlight and locate any additional fasteners. Unscrew them with your socket wrench or pull them out with pliers if they\u2019re Christmas tree fasteners. If you aren\u2019t sure how the flares attach or which bolts hold it in place, consult your truck owner\u2019s manual or the truck manufacturer."

Tighten a nut onto each bolt from the back with your socket wrench. Repeat the process for each wheel well. This will be easier if you have a partner to hold the flares in place while you bolt them down. Always follow the instructions that come with the flares you use.

It usually protects from scuffs and dings, but can also cover up rust in the area. If the rust is on your bumper, get a bumper bra designed to fit your truck. Always read and follow the instructions that come with the product you use. These are common instructions that you might see. Open the truck hood. Pop the hood, pull it up, and lock it in place with the hood rod. Make sure the hood is secure so it doesn\u2019t fall down while you\u2019re working. Tuck the top section of the bra over the front of the hood. Bumper bras come in 2 sections. The top section is a smaller fabric strip that tucks over the hood like a glove. Hold it so the straps are on the bottom and the open portion faces the edge of the hood. Slide it over the hood and push it back so it\u2019s snug. Run your finger along the front of the hood to make sure the bra isn\u2019t bunched up anywhere. Slip the side straps into the holes on either side of the hood. Hoods have holes along their underside edges for attachments. Pull the strap on each side of the bra back towards the truck until it\u2019s tight. Tuck the hook on the front of each strap into one of the holes on the bottom of your hood. Depending on the type of cover you have, the straps may be adjustable. Pull them until they\u2019re snug against the hood. Pull the cross strap so it\u2019s taut. Look on the bottom of the cover for another strap that points across the hood. Pull it to the opposite side and hook it into the clip on the other side of the cover. Then pull the free part of the strap to tighten it up. Your model of hood cover may not have a cross strap. Skip this step if it doesn\u2019t. Tuck the lower flap over the front of the truck. With the top part done, now move on to the lower part of the covering. Take the lower bra section and tuck it over the truck, above the headlights. If there are hooks or other attachments, loop them over the front of the truck. Smooth out the covering so it\u2019s even and not bunched up in any spots. Line the openings in the bra up with the license plate and headlights so you can see them. This means that the bra is aligned properly. Fold the clips by the tires into the wheel wells. One each end of the bra, near the wheels, look for clips. Fold these around the edge of the truck body and into the wheel well. Give the covering a slight tug to see if the clips are attached. If not, tuck them in again. Hook all the plastic clips on the top and bottom of the cover to the truck. There may be some remaining clasps or hooks that you haven\u2019t secured yet. Work along the entire border of the bra and fasten any hooks you come across. When you\u2019re done, close the hood. Some bumper bras have small flaps that tuck underneath the headlights. Check to see if yours has this feature, and insert the flaps.",
