          "description":"Run shish-kabob sticks through fresh fruits to create a fun snack that older children can easily eat and carry around with them. Use smaller fruits such as berries, or slice larger fruits such as pineapples so they fit on the stick. Provided the child can eat dairy, you can add cheese to your fruit shish-kabobs as well. Use cookie cutters or bento cutters to slice the cheese into fun shapes like hearts and stars. Keep in mind you'll want to save this snack for older kids, not toddlers, since the sticks are pointy."

          "headline":"Include dried fruit.",
          "description":"Fresh fruit is always a healthy and naturally gluten-free snack, but dried fruit is equally tasty and not as messy to clean up. Dried fruit can be eaten as a snack on its own, or mixed into gluten-free trail mixes. The fiber in dried fruit is filling, but watch the portion sizes \u2013 just a few pieces of dried fruit typically is enough, but it can be hard to gauge since they're so much smaller than fresh fruit. A single serving is about what would fit in the palm of an adult hand. You can buy pre-packaged dried fruit, but it may be cheaper to go to a specialty grocery or whole foods store that allows you to buy loose amounts of particular fruits by weight \u2013 especially if you want a variety of fruits to create your own mix. You can make trail mixes sweet or savory, depending on the child's tastes and the kind of snacks you want. Shake the ingredients in a zippered bag with spices, or spread them on a bake tray and bake them for a few minutes at low heat to seal in the flavor. Add nuts such as almonds for an added boost of protein."

          "description":"You can buy whole vegetables and cut them up yourself, or buy pre-cut vegetables or smaller sizes such as baby carrots. Use a variety of different vegetables and the kids will be attracted to the colorful presentation. You also can cut the vegetables into fun shapes. Look for bento box cutters (they look like cookie cutters, but they're smaller) in shops that sell cooking and food preparation supplies. Add pieces of cheese as well, if the kids are able to eat dairy. Use a sectioned container, or get creative and use lettuce to section off a larger tray."

          "headline":"Make celery sticks fun.",
          "description":"If your kids turn up their noses at celery sticks, add peanut butter and raisins to create \"ants on a log.\" While peanut butter and raisins are the traditional ingredients, you can get creative and substitute whatever your kids enjoy. You can use different types of raisins, or mix it up with dried berries such as dried blueberries or cranberries. Almond butter or other spreads such as hummus can be used instead of peanut butter if the child has peanut allergies."

          "headline":"Beat the heat with frozen grapes.",
          "description":"Grapes can be a quick and inexpensive gluten-free snack for kids. They also freeze really well, and can be broken apart into individual servings and popped in the freezer for a cool treat during warmer months. Freezing grapes enhances the flavor as well as being slower to eat. To freeze them properly, remove them from their stems and rinse them well. From there you can portion them into small bags to freeze, or spread them out flat on a lined cookie sheet. Other fruits are good frozen as well, such as blueberries, peaches, and strawberries."

          "description":"Applesauce is a naturally gluten-free snack, but buying pre-packaged individual servings can get expensive. If you have a crockpot and a little bit of time, you can make your own applesauce for a fraction of the cost of commercial brands. Search online for recipes and find one that suits your taste. The good part about making your own applesauce is that you can season it to taste, or add other fruits such as cranberries or strawberries. You also have the ability to control the consistency, so you can have chunkier applesauce if that's what the kids like. Keep in mind that the applesauce will become sweeter as it cools, so don't make it too sweet while cooking. Use a mix of apples to create more complex flavors, or make different varieties with specific types of apples."

          "headline":"Stock up on veggie chips.",
          "description":"Veggie chips are a gluten-free crispy snack that works great with dips or on their own. If you buy pre-packaged commercial chips, check the bag to make sure they're gluten-free. You also can make your own veggie chips by baking kale or other vegetables. Season to taste and bake for a few minutes on low heat until they're crispy. There are plenty of recipes online for various baked vegetable snack chips. Experiment with seasonings to create savory or even sweeter varieties. For example, you can make chips by baking thin slices of beets or sweet potatoes and dust them with cinnamon and nutmeg for a sweeter snack. To make veggie chips, peel and cut up some veggies (carrots, beets, zucchini, yellow squash, sweet potatoes, etc.) into slices about 1/8\u201d thick. Season the veggie slices with 1 tsp of herbs and salt. Then place them on a lightly greased baking pan in a single layer and bake for about 1 hours at 200 degrees Fahrenheit. Then, flip the chips and bake for another 30 to 60 minutes, or until the slices are all crispy."

          "headline":"Create healthy dips.",
          "description":"Most dips are naturally gluten-free, but it can get more difficult if your kids have other dietary restrictions. Regardless, you can still often make healthier dips at home rather than buying commercially prepared dips. Hummus and nut butters are common gluten-free dips. If you buy pre-packaged varieties, check the labels to make sure they're gluten-free. You also can make your own at home fairly easily if you have a food processor. There are a number of relatively simple recipes online. You also can dice whole fresh vegetables to make your own salsa at home. While many commercial salsas are too hot and spicy for young children, if you make your own you can control the flavor. Dips can be sweet as well as salty. For example, you can make a decadent chocolate almond butter that both your and your kids will enjoy using for spreading on a rice cake or dipping fresh fruit."

          "headline":"Use rice cakes instead of bread.",
          "description":"Rice cakes are a gluten-free alternative that you can use for full-size or finger sandwiches (look for the mini variety). They also can take the place of crackers or toast for a side at breakfast or an after-school snack. Spread hummus or a nut butter on toasted rice cakes, or put a slice of cheese on top of a rice cake along with a piece of fruit or vegetable. For example, you might spread a thin layer of almond butter on toasted mini rice cakes, then add a thin slice of cheese cut out in the shape of a star with a half a strawberry on top."

          "headline":"Experiment with popcorn.",
          "description":"Commercial popcorn typically is considered junk food, but homemade popcorn can be a healthy snack if you prepare it properly and don't cover it in butter and salt. You can use store-bought popcorn or microwave popcorn if you want to save some time, but choose varieties that don't have any added salt or butter. You also may be able to find organic popcorn if you want. Sprinkle on your own spices or use a gluten-free spice mix, and shake the popcorn in a sealed bag to distribute the spices. You can make this snack sweet or savory. Mix in dried fruits or nuts to add variety. Spread them on a bake sheet and drizzle the entire mix with syrup or olive oil, then bake for a few minutes at a low heat to create a flavorful mix that can be eaten in clumps."

Use oats, which are not related to grains such as wheat and barley, and are naturally gluten-free.

All your kids' favorite sweet treats can be made using alternative flours, such as almond flour. Keep in mind that gluten-free baked goods typically must be refrigerated soon after preparation, or they will become inedible.

          "description":"There's nothing about a gluten-free diet that means you can't include any sugar, but you may generally want to avoid refined sugar in kids' snacks and treats for other health reasons. Pure cane sugar is one alternative to refined sugar. Brown sugar also typically is more healthy than refined sugar and you typically don't need to use as much. If you're including fruits in your baked goods or other sweet treats, you may not need to add any sugar as the fruits have their own natural sweetness. Honey, maple syrup, and molasses also can be used to replace refined sugar. Check recipes carefully and pay attention to the substitution amounts. You'll want to use less honey or syrup than refined sugar, and you'll also want to reduce the total liquids in the recipe to keep it from getting too runny. Generally, you want to use about half as much honey or syrup as the amount of sugar the recipe calls for. For each cup (240 milliliters) of honey or syrup you use, decrease other liquids by about a quarter of a cup (60 milliliters) total. Make sure you keep the proportions consistent."

          "description":"Baking fruits such as apples and pears can create a warm, sweet snack that's also healthy and nutritious. Use harder, denser fruits for baking, and glaze them with spices or stuff them with healthy nuts and other dried fruit. To bake apples or pears, you generally want to preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius). Coat your fruits with maple or agave syrup to create a candied coating, adding spices such as cinnamon to taste. Use water to thin the syrup to your desired consistency. You may want to play around with this until you get it right. You also can find various recipes online or in cookbooks for baked-fruit snacks and desserts."

However, there are plenty of candy recipes that you can use to make simple sweet treats at home for a fraction of what you would pay for commercial gluten-free candies. Look for recipes that use chocolate and coconut and have few ingredients. Pay attention to prep time and make sure you have everything you'll need. Keep in mind that many candies and fudge recipes require a food thermometer because you have to maintain the correct temperature for the candy to come out right. You can make gummy candies using gelatin and fruit juice (keep your fruit juice organic and without added sugar, or squeeze fruit yourself), and add spices as desired. Whisk your ingredients in a small saucepan over low heat until they are smooth and liquified. Then pour into the mold of your choice and let them set in the fridge. They should keep for a couple of weeks. To make cinnamon candies much like the \"red hots\" commonly given out as treats on Valentine's Day, use dried cranberries, sunflower seeds, vanilla extract, and cinnamon. Use half the amount of hulled sunflower seeds as dried cranberries, with vanilla extract and cinnamon to taste. All you have to do is mix your ingredients in a food processor and process them until they are sticky and well-mixed, then shape them into balls or hearts and stick them in the fridge for a bit to firm them up."
