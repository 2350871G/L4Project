          "description":"When your boots or shoes start to look old and shabby, use them as makeshift flower pots instead of throwing them out. Any shoe will work but boots, like cowboy boots or work boots, are your best option since they have deep insides to fill with soil. Use a screwdriver or drill to make holes in the bottom of the shoes to allow water to drain out. If you have a fence in your garden, hang a row of colorful rain boots with plants inside to brighten up the fence."

          "description":"A vintage bicycle looks whimsical sitting in your garden, especially with blooms in its baskets. Prevent the soil from falling through the basket by placing a liner made of coconut fiber, which is also known as coir,  in it before adding the potting mix. Sphagnum moss or a plastic bag, while not as visually appealing, will work instead of coir, too. Paint the bike a pretty pastel hue or a bright neon to add a pop of color. You can even match the flowers to the bike's colors. If you don't like the look of lined baskets, place the plants in flower pots first, then set the pots inside the baskets. Lean the bike against a fence or tree, mount it to a wall, or simply use the kickstand to hold it up."

          "description":"Use non-toxic outdoor spray paint to coat your tire in the color of your choice. Set your painted tire in your garden and fill the center hole with soil to plant your flowers. Ask your local mechanic or auto shop if they have old tires they don't want. Lighter colors like pastel pink or pale blue reflect light better so they won't get as hot in the sun. This helps protect the plants. Spray designs like polka dots or stripes for a funkier feel. Stack tires in assorted sizes in a pyramid shape to create a multi-tiered garden. Choose plants with flowering vines, like moonflower or wisteria, to cascade down the stack."

Paint the toilet any color or design you'd like based on your style of garden. For example, an eye-popping blue works in a modern garden while a starry sky print is more whimsical. The older and more rusted the bathtub or toilet is, the more visually appealing it will be. Find used but clean bathtubs and toilets online or at an antiques store."

Fill the bottle with soil and the plant of your choice, then hang it on a pergola, patio, or tree branch. For a pretty hanging option, twist thick wire in copper, gold, bronze, or silver around the bottle so it wraps up the body, starting at the neck. Use the same wire to hang it. Drill a hole in the cork to allow water to drain out of the soil. Wear protective eye wear and gloves when you're cutting glass. Smaller beer bottles are ideal for succulents or herbs that don't need a lot of room."
