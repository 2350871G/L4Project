Red will make players mad when they can't win. Blue and green keeps them calm. If it's a minigame kind of game, make sure it works, and that you don't have to wait too long. If it's a disaster game, make sure the disasters are hard enough, and they don't have to wait too long for every disaster. If it's another kind of game, make something to do. A lot of hangout places on Roblox don't have any activities to do there."
