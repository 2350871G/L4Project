          "headline":"Opt for dark chocolate in moderation.",
          "description":"Dark chocolate contains antioxidants, flavanols, vitamins and nutrients that are beneficial to your health. Other chocolate varieties do not offer similar health benefits. Moderation is still important, so limit yourself to one or two ounces of dark chocolate at a time. Choose organic dark chocolate that is at least 70% cacao, which will contain the least amount of sugar-based calories per serving. Organic dark chocolate with 70% cacao or higher lacks the unhealthy additives included in other kinds of chocolate. It also contains a type of saturated fat that does not raise cholesterol levels. A 3.5 ounce (100g) bar of dark chocolate with 70-85% cocoa contains about 539 calories. A milk chocolate bar of the same size contains about 540 calories. However, milk chocolate has a lot more sugar."

          "headline":"Buy pre-packaged single serving chocolate snacks and baked goods.",
          "description":"Pre-packaged servings can help you control the amount of calories you take in. Many snack companies now offer their products packaged this way for their health-conscious customers. Each serving is typically limited to a certain amount of calories, usually between 100 and 200, making it easy for you to grab a low-calorie chocolate snack on the go. Look for chocolate snack products that advertise as being low-fat and low-calorie. Also look for statements like, \u201cOnly 100 calories in each single serving bag.\u201d\nPopular chocolate snacks that tend to be packaged this way are cookies, cereal bars, bite-sized candies and mini muffins."

          "headline":"Try low-fat and low-calorie frozen chocolate treats.",
          "description":"Many frozen chocolate treats, such as ice cream, are relatively high in calories and do not make great snack choices. However, skip the ice cream and give low-fat chocolate sorbet a try. Calories per serving vary from brand to brand, with some of them offering as little as 66 calories per \u00bc cup of sorbet. Chocolate popsicles, like Fudgesicles, are another low-calorie option. A fudgsicle contains 100 calories per serving. Opt for brands that are low-fat, low-calorie and sugar-free."

          "headline":"Eat sugar-free and/or fat-free chocolate pudding cups.",
          "description":"Chocolate pudding is a great way to enjoy a rich chocolate flavor without ingesting loads of calories. This calorie-conscious pudding is premade and sold in single-serving cups that come packaged together (usually as a six pack). The pudding is typically low in calories (usually about 90 calories) which most companies advertise visibly on the front of the packaging. Enjoy a chocolate pudding cup after dinner or toss one into your lunch as a low-calorie snack. If you want something a little more decadent but still relatively low-calorie, look for premade single servings of low-fat chocolate mousse. You\u2019ll likely find them right next to the pudding cups in the dairy section of your grocery store."

Melt about one half of a standard size chocolate bar and drizzle it over 1 \u00bd cups of low-fat popcorn. Stir or toss the popcorn so that the chocolate gets distributed evenly. Use a dark chocolate bar to get the most health benefits. Popcorn is also a healthy provider of soluble fiber."

          "description":"Fruit is a healthy snack choice because it is low-calorie, low-fat and high in fiber. It's also relatively easy to portion control. Melt semi-sweet chocolate chips or half a chocolate bar in a microwave-safe bowl. Dip strawberries, bananas, mango slices, orange segments and any other fruits you like into it. You can use chocolate syrup instead of melted chocolate, if you prefer. Ten chocolate-dipped strawberries can provide two full servings of fruit and plenty of vitamins for a mere 140 calories. Two mango slices with one tablespoon of chocolate syrup contains approximately 80 calories."

Seal the bag and shake it vigorously to combine the ingredients. Unseal the bag and your snack is ready to enjoy. Fiber-filled popcorn is very filling and the addition of nuts and dried fruits provide additional health benefits. The dark chocolate will enhance the flavor without adding lots of calories, and provides health benefits of its own. Pack a snack-sized bag of your mix into your lunch for a low-calorie chocolatey treat."

Powdered cocoa is low in calories and the hot liquid makes it a very satisfying snack. Baking cocoa comes in an easy-to-use powdered form and you can find it on the baking aisle of any grocery store.
