However, Internet patterns will not provide you with paper pattern pieces to cut out the fabric pieces for your robe. If you want your robe to be in a specific style and size, visit a craft supply store to purchase a pattern. If you are new to sewing, look into easy patterns with a simple belt around the waist. If you are more experienced, opt for intermediate to advanced patterns that feature buttons, special collars, or other intricate details."

          "headline":"Select your fabric.",
          "description":"You can make a robe from just about any type of fabric you want. Consider when and how you plan to use the robe before choosing a fabric. Also, consider your budget and the price of the fabric since you will need at least 2 yards of fabric to make your robe. Patterns list the recommended type of fabric on the package, as well as how much you will need. Make sure to check the pattern\u2019s recommendations before you purchase your fabric for the robe. Make a warm winter robe using fleece or flannel material, create a lightweight summer robe using cotton or satin, or sew a water absorbent robe using terry cloth. Your pattern will recommend a different amount of fabric depending on the width of the fabric. For example, you may need 2.5 yards (2.3 m) of fabric that is 45 inches (110 cm) wide or 2 yards (1.8 m) of fabric that is 60 inches (150 cm) wide. Some robe patterns available on the Internet encourage you to use an old sheet as your robe fabric. This is a great way to repurpose a sheet and save money on fabric!"

Consider what you would like to add to your robe to customize it, or just check the list on your pattern and get the recommended items. Embroider a monogram onto a robe for a personalized look, add decorative buttons down the front for a fancier closure, or sew trim onto the bottom of the robe for added interest. Patterns usually include a list of any embellishments that are required, so make sure to check your pattern before you start sewing."

Then, use sharp scissors to cut all of the paper pattern pieces along the same size lines. To ensure that you cut out the right size for all pieces, you may want to trace along the size lines with a red pencil or highlighter before you cut them. Most patterns will instruct you to cut out between 6 and 12 different pieces to sew your robe. Make sure that you cut out all of the required pieces!"

Usually, you will be instructed to fold the fabric in half so that the raw edges of your fabric are lined up. For example, you may need to cut one or more of the pieces along the fold of your fabric to create a larger piece, such as for the back of the robe or sleeves. You may be able to cut out other pieces from any area of the fabric, such as for the robe\u2019s front panels or sash."

Sewing patterns will often feature a map of how to arrange the pieces. Use this as your guide. Once you have fit all of the pieces on the fabric, pin them into place by inserting straight pins through the edges of the paper pieces and both layers of fabric. Use pins with rounded ends so that they don\u2019t go all the way through the fabric and get lost. Your pattern instructions may indicate a different layout for fabric that is 45 inches (110 cm) wide versus fabric that is 60 inches (150 cm) wide. Be sure to use the correct map for your fabric\u2019s width."

These are essential for properly lining up your robe pieces. Do not cut any of the folded areas if the pattern has indicated that you should line the piece up with a fold. It is important to keep these larger pieces intact. Keep the pieces separated after cutting them. It is helpful to leave the pattern pieces pinned to them until you are ready to use each piece."

Use your hands to guide the fabric under presser foot as the machine pulls it through. The straight stitch is usually the default setting or setting #1 on a sewing machine. Consult your sewing machine\u2019s instruction manual if you are unsure about how to set the machine to the straight stitch setting. Although it will take much longer than using a sewing machine would, you can sew the robe by hand.
