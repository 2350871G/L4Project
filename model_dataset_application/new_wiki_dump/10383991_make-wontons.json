          "headline":"Combine water, flour and salt in a bowl.",
          "description":"In a large bowl, combine \u20443  c (79 mL) of water with 2 cups (256 g) of all-purpose flour and \u00bd a teaspoon (2.8 g) of salt. Mix them thoroughly until they form a smooth ball of dough. As you stir, pull stuck flour off the bowl to incorporate it in the dough. If the dough becomes dry, mix in about 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of water at a time until it reaches a solid consistency. You can also mix in an egg for additional consistency. Another option is to buy premade wonton wrappers. Supermarkets may sell them. You can fill them and cook them right away."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Knead the dough for 5 minutes on a floured surface.",
          "description":"You can use any flat surface you have available, including a clean countertop or large cutting board. Dust the surface with flour before dumping the dough onto it. To knead the dough, use the heel of your hand to push it forward, then roll it back towards you. Continue doing this until the dough is firm but smooth. Knead the dough at a steady rhythm. It does get exhausting, so make sure you\u2019re prepared. Have someone else on hand to step in if you think you will need the help. The dough will look smooth and hold its shape when it is ready. If it still looks lumpy, add more flour to your work surface and continue kneading."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Cover the dough with a damp cloth for 1 hour.",
          "description":"Leave the dough out on the countertop or place it in a large, clean bowl. After dampening a clean cloth, squeeze excess moisture out of it before draping it over the dough. The cloth prevents the dough from drying out as it rests. If you don\u2019t have a towel available, cover the dough with plastic wrap. You can also try keeping it in a large pot covered by a lid. You can also divide the dough in half before covering each ball with a separate cloth. Let the dough balls rest for at least 10 minutes."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Divide the dough in half and roll it into squares.",
          "description":"After splitting the dough, use a rolling pin to flatten each ball individually. Aim to make each square about 15 in \u00d7 9 in (38 cm \u00d7 23 cm) in size. You can dust your work surface with cornstarch to prevent the dough from sticking. You can also divide the dough into 4 balls, then roll them into 10 \u20442 in \u00d7 10 \u20442 in (27 cm \u00d7 27 cm) squares. It doesn\u2019t make much difference, but the smaller dough balls may be easier to handle."

          "description":"A dough knife or bench scraper is the best tool for the job, but you can use any large, sharp knife. Cutting the dough will give you individual wonton wrappers ready to be filled and cooked. Try to keep the wrappers an even size so they cook at the same rate when you make the wontons. If you don\u2019t have time to make your own dough, you can always try buying premade wrappers at the supermarket."

Flatten the filling out as much as you can, but keep it it in the center of the wonton so it doesn\u2019t leak out when you fold the wrapper. Spooning generous amounts of filling is tempting, but err on the side of caution to avoid having the wontons fall apart on you as they cook. Wonton dough is pretty delicate. If you try to do too much at once, the wrappers can dry out. Leaving scoops of moist filling on the wrappers also causes problems since the wrappers may absorb moisture and fall apart.

Then, dip your finger into the egg and drag it along the edges to create a \u201cglue\u201d border. Turn the egg into an egg wash by mixing it with \u20442  c (120 mL) of water. If you plan on making a large batch of wontons, this gives you more egg \u201cglue\u201d to work with. You can also forgo the egg by spreading water around the edges of the wrappers.

Repeat this with the remaining 2 corners to create a little wonton package you can drop into a cooking liquid. There are many ways to fold a wonton. As long as you get the wontons to hold together and cook through, any folding method is valid."

Leave space between each wonton and avoid stacking them. Keep the wontons covered with plastic wrap at all times to prevent them from drying out. You can also cover the wontons with a light, dry towel. Uncooked wontons can easily be frozen this way. Put parchment paper on the baking tray so the wontons don\u2019t stick. Then, place the covered tray in the freezer for about an hour. Once the wontons have frozen through, move them to resealable containers in the freezer. They will lat from 4 to 6 months."
