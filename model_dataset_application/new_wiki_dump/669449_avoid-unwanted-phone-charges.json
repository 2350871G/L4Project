          "description":"Any kind of premium texting service can put extra charges on your bill. You may accidentally sign up for one of these through \"free\" giveaways and other sweepstakes, and they can run up charges on your phone bill. Say no to any suspicious looking sweepstakes, especially things like texting quiz games or horoscopes. If you get a text asking for a consent to continue sending you texts, say \"no\" unless you asked for the service. Also, avoid clicking on in-game ads in apps, which can sometimes lead to you signing up for things you don't want."

          "description":"Similarly, apps can run up charges. While some apps are free when you download them, you can make purchases in the game to make the game go faster or to make it more interesting. If you're not paying attention, you may be charged for something when you didn't realized it cost money. One option is to avoid games that have in-app purchases. However, that can be difficult, as many apps today have this option. Usually, it will say in the app store whether it has in-app purchases or not. It's also important to preview games. If you plan on giving games to your kids, play them first to see what purchases and ads you run into. Disable in-app purchases. You may be able to disable in-app purchases in settings on your phone. If you can't, talk to your phone company about what options you have."

          "description":"Look at your phone bill each month. Crammers are third-party vendors that add charges to your phone bill, sometimes without you realizing it. This practice is illegal, but it usually happens because your phone company allowed the crammer to place the charge on your bill. Because telephone bills are so long and confusing, the charges often go unnoticed, and you end up paying for things you shouldn't. Cramming charges can be buried in your phone bill, so you need to look very closely. They can even be labelled in ways that are deceiving, such as \"calling charge,\" \"mobile fees,\" \"voicemail,\" \"member fee,\" or \"web hosting.\""

They can at least look at the charge to see where they're coming from, and they may be able to stop them. You can also contact the third party if you know where the charge is coming from. Have third-party charges blocked. If you are noticing cramming charges, tell your phone company to block any third-party vendors."

          "description":"To avoid going over on your plan, you need to know how much data you're allowed each month, as well as how many texts and minutes you get each month. You can find that information online or on your bill each month. Some companies have a set limit of data each month. Others offer unlimited data, but only a certain amount of high-speed data each month. If you want to avoid worrying about data overages, consider moving to a company that has unlimited data, even if it slows you down after a certain amount of usage. Similarly, you may have an unlimited plan for minutes texts, but you also may have a set limit."

You can also use an app to monitor your data usage, especially if your phone doesn't have built-in monitoring. Some services will even send you alerts when you reach a certain point. Another option is using your phone company to monitor usage. You can either download your company's app or go online to see how much data you've used in this billing cycle. Also, sometimes you can get your telephone company to send an alert when you reach a certain limit. You usually need to set up these alerts online or over the phone with the company."

One option is just saving data-hungry entertainment, such as streaming videos and music, until you're on WiFi, so that you're not using data. You can turn off data for individual apps under settings. You can also turn off push notifications for each app and auto-syncing, also under settings. Another option is turn off cellular data altogether, so you can't run up any data. Turn it off under settings."

Basically, you use a messenger app instead of sending text to people, and they work pretty much like text messages. For instance, apps like Skype and Facebook let you text for free using their app, as long as the other person is using the same app. While it's not a perfect solution, it does let you communicate with other people without using texts or data."

Most of the time, to call for free, the other person needs to have the app, too. However, some apps also let you make calls to other phone numbers. In some cases, you'll need to pay per minute, usually at a fairly cheap rate, while a few apps will let you call totally for free."
