The following sizes are just suggestions, it's your imagination, so make the sizes whatever works for you:\nIf you are adopting a Shetland pony, you won't need more than a 1 foot (0.3 m) X 2 feet (0.6 m) paddock (with shelter included). If you are buying a Clydesdale or draft, you should have at least a 3 feet (0.9 m) X 2 feet (0.6 m) paddock with the shelter. Use large pieces of cardboard painted green to represent fields or paddocks. You can also take the horses outside, just be sure to give your toys a good clean after being outdoors."
