You may not want to put shelving in an area where you tend to temporarily store things that are on the floor as you may not be able to comfortably reach the shelves. What kinds of things will you be storing on the shelves? You will want whatever it is to be convenient ie. you wouldn't want to store laundry items on an opposite wall from your clothes washer. Measure the area you have chosen for your shelves keeping in mind the distance between shelves."
