To soften the butter, measure it out and place it in a bowl. Set it out on the counter at room temperature and allow it to sit for about 30 minutes. You can also use a stand mixer to beat the butter.

You don\u2019t want to overwork the dough, though -- only punch it down until it\u2019s roughly its original size. The dough shouldn't stick to your hands, but if it feels sticky, you can lightly dust your hands with flour first. Recover the dough and let it sit for 10 minutes. Place the damp kitchen towel back on top of the bowl. Allow the dough to rest for another few minutes before shaping it. Divide the dough into 12 pieces. Using clean hands, break the dough into 12 equally sized pieces. Next, roll each piece into a ball. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place the dough on it. To prevent the rolls from sticking to the baking sheet, place a piece of parchment paper on it. Set the rolls on top of the paper, making sure to space them about 3-inches (7.6-cm) apart. Depending on how large your baking sheet is, you may need more than one. You can grease the sheet with butter if you don\u2019t have any parchment paper. Topping the Rolls Divide the topping into 12 balls and flatten them. The topping will have a thick paste-like consistency, so use clean hands to separate it into 12 equally sized balls. Press down on the balls with the palm of your hand to flatten them until they're approximately \u215b- to \u00bc-inch thick (3- to 6-mm) thick. Place one piece of topping on each dough ball. Set one of the flattened topping pieces on top of each roll on the baking sheet. Press the topping down onto the dough lightly to secure it in place. The topping and dough should align, but if the topping is slightly larger, press it down over the sides of the dough. Cut grooves into the topping. Use a sharp knife, such as a paring knife, to lightly score the topping. You can create simple curved lines or a crisscross design, depending on your preference. Cover the rolls again and let them rise until they double in size. Once the topping is in place and scored, place a clean, damp kitchen towel over the baking sheet to cover the rolls. Allow them to rise for about 40 minutes. Baking the Rolls Preheat the oven. Just before the rolls are finished rising, set the oven temperature to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C).
