  "text":" Create Outline of Caravan Trailer Get a breakfast cereal box.  Cut it up.  Make a sketch of what each side of the trailer will look like.  Using a pencil,  draw the outline shape on one of the sides of the box.  Remember that one side won't have a door (a few caravans did have doors both sides,  but most don't).  Use the bare, unprinted side of the cardboard for the outside. This is easier to draw on and paint sticks to it much better because the primer soaks in and seals it as well. Once you've got the outline of one side of the caravan,  use it as a template,  and draw round it on the other piece of cardboard so you'll have the other side of the caravan.  Mark out where the window holes need to be cut,  and door for whichever side it's going on. Most have the door on what would be the passenger side of a car. Decide if you want an opening door or not. For a 'pretend' one,  score out the shape using an empty ballpoint pen. The same pen can also be used to make any rivet marks (as you'd have on an old caravan). Start Creating the Caravan Trailer Next,  make the floor. Getting the caravan in proportion is important,  and it's easy to make the floor too narrow. Test this with a few bits of paper to make sure it's how you want it. Very thick cardboard is good for this like cardboard from a ring binder folder.

Scissors are not ideal because they will bend or crease this thick cardboard,  or the scissors may even break. Once you have the floor shape cut out,  you need to stick balsa wood all around the outside shape for both sides of the caravan. Follow the shape as closely as possible.

Glue the sides to the floor. Allow the glue to set well before attempting to stick the ends on. And make sure the sides are aligned correctly before gluing the ends on, or the caravan might look like a crooked house or an insurance write off. By now it's probably starting to resemble a caravan. Now you have a choice. Do you want this caravan to have an interior or not. If you have the time and inclination,  go for it. If not,  it will look fine anyway, but you need to make some curtains.

You will need to do this on the inside as well as the outside because the glue holds them in better if there is masking tape on the inside where it fixes to the walls of the caravan. You can paint the masking tape with aluminum coloured Humbrol paint. Axle & Suspension:  This can be purely functional,  or you can make it look realistic as well. The quickest and easiest way is a single phone card with a piece of coat hanger wire attached. Put a slight bend in the phone card. A cigarette lighter works well for this,  but you may have to experiment with a few until you get it right. Make two holes in one end of the card,  attach the axle to the other. Fit the wheels.

A brief bit of heat from a lighter helps it to stay the size you need it to be. Once the wheels are on and you're happy that they're in the right position, you can put a tiny bit of glue on to hold them,  but this is optional. Line up the suspension / axle assembly under the caravan. When the wheels are lined up with the wheel arches,  mark the position,  and then glue it on. To give it some extra strength,  you could glue a layer of cereal box cardboard over this to hold it. You could use very short self tapping screws to hold this on.",
