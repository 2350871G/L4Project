There maybe 2 or even 3 branches that are all large and a similar size to each other. As the tree grows, these will turn into multiple leaders and create a weaker tree. Decide which branch looks like it is the most vertical and centered on the trunk  and choose that one to be the dominant leader. Trim the other branches that may turn into other leaders by reducing their size to allow more sunlight to reach the dominant leader you chose. Keep the dominant leader long."

Make a second cut on the top of the branch a few inches farther out that the undercut. This prevents the falling branch from tearing the bark off of the trunk.
