          "description":"Craft stores have a huge variety in their candle, home d\u00e9cor, and seasonal section. You can also find them in some home improvement stores as well. Choose a shape and material that appeals to you. Lanterns with metal frames are the most popular, but you can get ones with wooden frames too. Most lanterns have four panels, but you can get lanterns with five or six panels. Don't worry too much about the color; you can always repaint it. Instead, pay attention to the design."

          "description":"If decorating a lantern sounds overwhelming and you don't know where to start, choose your holiday first, then find a theme and color scheme that goes with that holiday. This will come in handy when you have to find paint, lights, and decorations for your lantern. For example:\nBlack, purple, and orange are classic Halloween colors. If pumpkins and ghosts aren't your thing, try a Victorian or Gothic theme. Red and green are traditional Christmas colors, but you can also go with a winter wonderland theme. In this case, your color scheme might be silver, white, and blue."

Let the paint dry, then apply a second coat if the first coat is too thin. Remove the tape, then let the paint dry. Keep the holiday you are celebrating in mind. Black is great for Halloween while red is perfect for Christmas."

          "description":"Here is where you can get really creative. You can etch or paint the glass, or even glue items to it. Because the glass panels in a lantern can be difficult to remove, you will need to decorate 1 side at a time. Here are some ideas to get you started:\nUse stencils and a glass etching cream to create frosted designs. Create silhouettes with stencils and acrylic craft paint. Hot glue snowflake ornaments or silk fall leaves to the glass to create a more festive design. Paint designs with decoupage glue and sprinkle iridescent glitter over it for a sparkly effect."

          "description":"Each 1 of these will give you a different effect. Pillar, votive, and tea light LED candles will give you the most traditional look. If you prefer something more magical looking, consider battery-operated string lights. You can get mini string lights that look like Christmas tree lights, or you can get tiny-bulbed fairy lights instead. String lights are a great option if you are filling your lantern to the top with a filler, such as pinecones or ornaments. You can use real candles, but only if you aren't adding any other decorations inside, and only if the lantern is made from metal--not wood. You can even use both, an LED pillar or votive light and fairy lights."

Add some other decorations, such as pinecones. For a Christmas lantern, try branches that have red berries on them. Add 2 to 3 mini pinecones. For an Easter lantern, try boxwood branches or pastel flowers. Add some fake, glittery Easter eggs or pompom chicks. For a more elegant display, add a strand of delicate fairy lights into the lantern, then hide the battery pack under the candle."

Hide the battery pack at the top or bottom of the lantern. Close the lantern, than stand it upright. For Christmas, try pinecones or ornaments. You can also use sprigs of fake pine or branches with red berries on them. For Halloween or Thanksgiving, try fall silk leaves or mini foam pumpkins. Add some plastic spiders if it is for Halloween. For Easter, use plastic Easter eggs. You can get brightly colored ones, glittery ones, or realistic ones."

Secure the bow to the top of your lantern with wire or pipe cleaner. Use a wired ribbon that matches your theme and color scheme. Match the color of the wire or pipe cleaner to the color of the lantern. Make the bow the same size as the top of the lantern--or bigger for a fancier displace. This is a great alternative to decorating the inside of your lantern."

Remove the cardboard, open up the bag, and fill it with 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of rice, pebbles, or sand. Set an LED tea light into the paper bag. This works great for alternative Jack-o-Lanterns, but you can use other shapes for other holidays, such as flowers or snowflakes. Do not use a real candle for this. If you must use one, place it into a glass jar, and do not leave the lantern unattended."

Set battery-operated fairy lights or an LED tea light inside. You can use other shapes too, such as Christmas trees or stars. You can even make a Jack-o-Lantern! Add a rope handle to the jar, then decorate it with evergreen sprigs. For extra glow, paint your jar with two layers of spray paint. Use gold first, then a different color second."

Add some iridescent glitter into the Epsom salt for a hint of sparkle. If your jar is large, the glue may dry before you finish coating it.

Use colors that match the season, such as orange for Fall or blue for winter. Use shapes that match the holiday, such as a Jack-o-Lantern face for Halloween, or Santa and his sleigh for Christmas. You can use up to two layers of tissue paper. If you add too many, however, the light may not shine through."

Use a dry-erase marker to trace your design first. Wipe it clean with a dry cloth afterwards. Spray paint the can afterwards, if desired. For example, if you made a Jack-o-Lantern, paint it orange! Punch 2 holes near the top of the lantern, then loop wire through it so that you can hang it!"

Freeze the lantern overnight, then remove the rocks. Pour hot water over the outside and inside of the cans to loosen them, then pull the ice lantern out. Set it outside, then place a tea light into it. Use pieces of tape to keep the smaller can centered. Add some sprigs of holly or pine to make the lantern more festive.

Cut slits into the folded edge until they meet the line you drew. Do not cut past the line, however. Draw the line with a pencil. This way, you can erase it!

If you squash the tube, the fringe should flare out like a flower. You can glue the tube together instead, but you will have to hold it with paper clips or clothespins until it dries."

You can also use pieces of double-sided tape. How many strips you use depends on how big your lantern is. You need to use enough so that the entire bottom edge is lined with paper streamers. If you don't have paper streamers, cut 2 in (5.1 cm) wide strips from tissue paper instead. Match the color to the season. For example, for a 4th of July lantern, use red, white, and blue."
