Cross the two ends of the rope over each other. Press the tips onto the bottom of the U. Use your fingers to pinch the tips a bit to make sure they stay in place. Repeat with the remaining dough ropes. Cooking the Pretzels Get ready to boil and bake the pretzels. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees, and line a baking sheet or two with parchment paper. Coat the parchment paper with a little oil to keep the pretzels from sticking. In a large pot, bring the 10 cups of water and the baking soda to a boil. Make an egg wash. Place the eggs in a bowl and beat them lightly.  Boil the pretzels. Place a pretzel in the boiling water and allow it to cook for 30 seconds. Use tongs to remove the pretzel from the water and place it on the parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining pretzels. Glaze the pretzels with the egg wash and sprinkle them with salt. Use a pastry brush to lightly brush some beaten egg on each pretzel. Sprinkle the pretzels with pretzel salt or kosher salt. You can also add garlic salt, sesame seeds, black pepper, and other flavorings of your choice. Bake the pretzels. Place the pretzels in the oven and bake them for about 15 minutes, until they turn golden brown. If you like hard pretzels, reduce the heat to 350 degrees and bake the pretzels for an extra 15 minutes. Serve the pretzels.
