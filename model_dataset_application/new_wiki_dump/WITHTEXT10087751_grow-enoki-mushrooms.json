They most often come in the form of premade, ready-to-use grow blocks made of compacted substrate material like sawdust or straw. To begin growing the mushrooms, you simply wet and store the block. You can expect to pay around $20-25 for a basic starter kit. The price may be higher depending on the seasonal availability of certain varieties of mushrooms. A typical start kit contains enough materials to grow mushrooms continuously for 2-4 weeks."

          "description":"Your grow block should arrive inside an insulated plastic container or sleeve. Remove the lid of the container and pour the water directly over the top and sides of the block. Try to wet as much of the substrate material as you can. The more evenly you wet the grow block, the more area the mushrooms will have to begin growing. Your grow kit may specify a different amount of water, depending on the size of the block and the mushrooms' specific moisture requirements. Use filtered or distilled water, as tap water is treated with chemicals."

This will help trap moisture inside, making it an optimal environment for speedy growth. Don't seal off or pin down the edges of the bag. Your mushrooms will need some air in order to grow. You can also use a couple wet strips of newspaper (or any other kind of lightweight paper) if you don't have a plastic bag on hand. Just make sure the saturated newspaper isn't heavy enough to weigh down the mushrooms as they emerge."

A shelf on your refrigerator or a dim basement or pantry will work well. You could also leave your grow block in a shady spot outside, as long as temperatures don't drop below freezing. If you don't have a suitable cool place to keep your grow block, simply set it on the kitchen counter. Enoki mushrooms are a cold weather species of mushroom, but they'll also grow just fine at room temperature."

Once the small caps are fully formed, they'll be ready to harvest for cooking or propagation. Between the wood contained in the grow block and the moisture-trapping plastic, your mushrooms will have everything they need to flourish, so there should be no need to uncover them until they start fruiting."

However, you'll also get successful results using straw or ordinary garden compost. Stock up on enough substrate material to create a bed about 2 inches (5.1 cm) thick so your spores will have plenty of room and resources to grow.

Once it reaches roughly 180 \u00b0F (82 \u00b0C), reduce the temperature of the oven to 180 \u00b0F (82 \u00b0C) and continue heating for 3 hours. Use a meat thermometer to find the temperature of the substrate material every 15-20 minutes.
