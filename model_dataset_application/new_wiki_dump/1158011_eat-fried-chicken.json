Some pieces of fried chicken, like drumsticks, will have natural handles you can hold easily with one hand. For more awkward pieces, like the breast, use two hands to hold both ends of the piece. To get a better grip on the chicken and to prevent your hands from getting too greasy, wrap a napkin around one end of the chicken, such as around the tip of the wing or the top of the drumstick."
