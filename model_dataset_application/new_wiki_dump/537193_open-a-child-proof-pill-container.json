  "text":" Opening the Container Properly Place the container on a flat surface. This will ensure you get a good, even grip on the container.

Using the Edge of a Table Find a table with wide edge. The wide edge will provide enough leverage to rotate the cap. Hold the container so the bottom part of the cap is resting against the top edge of the table. Essentially, you want to place the edge of the table between the top and the bottom part of the cap. Pull the container in a quick, downward motion against the edge of the table. The cap should click and release as you move it downward against the edge. Another trick you can try is placing the cap underneath the edge of a table or kitchen counter. Holding the container firmly in one hand, apply pressure and rotate it until the cap clicks and releases. Using a Flat Surface Turn the container over on a flat surface. Use a table or a counter. Press the palm of your 'good' hand down on the base of the inverted container. Apply light pressure to the base. Rotate the container while keeping the lid motionless through friction. If you can, hold the lid with your other hand so it doesn\u2019t move. Stop rotating once the lid clicks or releases. Then, hold both the lid and container in your 'good' hand, and turn both of them over. You should now be able to lift the lid off and open the pill container.
