          "description":"Make this decision based on the number of people that it needs to accommodate, the amount of food that will be on it, and the type of party. For example, an outdoor party needs a table that will be weatherproof. The table itself plays a powerful role in setting the ambiance of the meal. A table made of exposed wood can set a more rustic tone, while a table of glass can appear more elegant. The table does not need to be expensive to set a good tone for the party. It is more important that it accommodates the people and food well. Even a scratched table can look elegant if properly adorned with a beautiful tablecloth. Different tables are appropriate for different types of parties. A low table can allow guests to be seated on the floor for a cultural theme or even a beach party. A picnic table can work well for a child\u2019s birthday party or a summer party. You might want to consider using a separate table for food and for eating. This can help keep the table from becoming overcrowded. This is an especially helpful technique for a buffet dinner."

          "description":"Ideally, the table will not be difficult to access or hinder guests from being easily seated. Placing a table by a window can allow your outdoor surroundings to inspire guests. You could place the table by a fireplace for a cozy party in winter. Consider placing your table in or near the kitchen for easy cleanup. For an outdoor party, consider placing the table in the shade or under an umbrella or canopy. This will allow for some protection from the sun and other natural elements."

          "headline":"Use a tablecloth or placemats.",
          "description":"This isn\u2019t always necessary if you want to show off your table, but it can add a beautiful decorative touch. It is also important for protecting your table, which you will probably want to do with a kid\u2019s table. Tablecloths can also make cleanup much faster and can add refinement to an old, worn table. It simply depends on the look you are going for. Choose your fabric wisely. Different fabrics evoke a different tone. Lace feels delicate and elegant, as does satin. Cotton is a great multi-purpose fabric for a variety of themes. Polyester cleans well and can have a nice sheen to it. A table runner is another way to add visual interest. Choose one that complements your color scheme or theme. Place it directly on the table, or even on top of a tablecloth for a layered look. You could choose an oval-shaped one to add an interesting design."

For a holiday party, dishes can even coincide with the theme. For example, a fun turkey-shaped platter will set the tone for Thanksgiving. Tailoring the dishes to the occasion makes a decorative statement and adds sophistication to an ordinary item. This is also true of glasses. They need to be appropriate for the type of party. A holiday party might have wine glasses while a kid\u2019s birthday party would not. A formal dinner or dessert party might even have champagne glasses."

If you want to get fancy, you could even try folding your napkins into a  fan or a  swan. It isn\u2019t terribly difficult yet it adds something special."

          "description":"The color scheme is a big part of setting the tone for your dining experience. Consider what type of gathering you are having and what feel you would like it to have. Light colors will come across as more delicate, bold colors appear more fun and energetic, dark colors can add romance and sophistication. Mix it up and try using some fun patterns. A bold geometric design will add artistic flair while a soft floral pattern will add elegance. With patterns, a little goes a long way. Consider using them to provide an interesting accent, such as with the napkins or a table runner. Each season has a distinct feel to it that can be reflected with the table\u2019s color scheme. For spring, pastels or floral patterns are a safe bet. For a winter theme, you could go cream colored or ivory and add in some darker browns or maroon. In fall, jewel tones can beautifully complement the rich shades of harvest. In summer, bright colors will make a bold statement."

You don\u2019t want to block the line of sight of your guests. If you are feeling artistic, try making your own centerpiece. You could add glass stones to an elegant bowl or decorate a small pot of flowers. Even food can be arranged into a centerpiece when placed strategically on a small pedestal.

If it is a large table, setting the food closer to guests so that they can pass it around is helpful. Set up food in different heights. If you have a lot of dishes, levels can help fit more without being overcrowded. Try using a stand for your bread platter or placing an entree on top of a covered box. If you don\u2019t enough horizontal space, vertical space always helps. Use a separate table if there isn't enough room. Sometimes there is more food than space at the table. Don\u2019t let this deter you. Set up a serving table near the dining table and have guests help themselves. This will create a buffet style dining experience. You could do something similar for dessert or even for drinks. It doesn't have to all fit at one table."
