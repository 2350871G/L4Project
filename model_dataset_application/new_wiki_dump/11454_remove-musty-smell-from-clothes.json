If your clothes have mold spores, they won't stop smelling musty until the spores have been killed. Check around your house to see which of the following mold killing products you have on hand:\nWhite vinegar\nBorax\nBaking soda"

Allow it to completely fill before continuing. It's best to use hot water to ensure the mold spores get killed. If you're washing clothing that can't be washed in hot water, try using cold water instead. You may have to wash the clothes more than once to get rid of the smell."

Finish running the wash cycle as usual. Each of these items has properties that help to kill mold spores and remove bad smells. If the clothes are particularly musty, you can use baking soda and vinegar together. If you aren't able to pour the product straight into the water, mix it with a cup of hot water and use the liquid detergent dispenser.

Even during the winter, you can dry your clothes outside on a sunny day. Try to place them in an area that gets full sun and wind. If it's raining outside, you'll need to use your dryer instead. This isn't ideal, since the dryer is an enclosed space that doesn't allow fresh air to flow through your clothes. If your clothes come out of the dryer still smelling musty, wait for a sunny day to wash them and dry them outside."

Look in the laundry products section for a \"no-rinse wash.\" It's a concentrated solution that comes in bottles, similar to detergent. In most cases you'll mix a capful of the no-rinse wash with several liters of water. Pour it into a spray bottle. Spray your musty garment so that all parts of it are slightly damp. Hang the garment to dry outside in the sun and wind. When it dries, the smell should be gone. If it still smells musty, repeat the process. Note that this does require wetting the fabric.
