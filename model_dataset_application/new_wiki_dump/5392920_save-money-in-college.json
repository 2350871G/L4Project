          "description":"Habits like smoking, excessive drinking, and shopping are all behaviors that can burn a hole into your wallet if you don't monitor your spending. If you're serious about saving, cut down on store-bought coffee too \u2013 limit it to say, once a week. It is said that the habits you form in college set the tone for the rest of your life. Cigarettes and alcoholic drinks are expensive. If you can manage to cut these lifestyle choices, you will find saving much easier. To do this, you may have to surround yourself with like-minded friends. Remember \u2013 your friends influence how you behave, and vice versa. If you want to form healthy habits, apart from having a strong will of your own, you'll also need good friends to encourage you along the way."

          "description":"Whenever you have several bills of small denominations, try to exchange them for one larger one \u2013 for instance trade out twenty one-dollar bills for one twenty-dollar bill. This may help remind you that you're spending real, significant money. Many people are happy to hand off dollar notes, but think twice before coughing up a twenty. Thus, dealing in larger notes can help you be aware of your spending."

          "headline":"Make meals at home, and avoid eating out.",
          "description":"Learn to cook. Try to buy food in bulk \u2013 grains and vegetables are great staples. Eating out can quickly eat up your savings, even if you're just living off of fast food. Do what's best for your health and your wealth. Consider preparing the week's meals in advance. Set a \"food prep\" day\u2014say, every Sunday\u2014on which you make a large amount of something that will keep well throughout the week. Soups, rice dishes, and breads are good for this. If you cook it and store in a fridge, it will last longer than it does fresh. Groceries, especially fresh fruit and vegetables, are sometimes sold at lower prices at certain times: stores try to get rid of food that is not fresh enough to sell, but still has a few days in it. Learn when those times are, and stock up on good, healthy stuff. Dine out as an occasional treat, not as a matter of course. Spend your money on a truly worthwhile dinner every now and then, rather than fast food every night. Fill up on free samples when you go to the grocery store. Learn which stores (Costco, for instance) have daily samples, and take this opportunity to treat yourself to a free meal while you shop."

Sell back your textbooks when you're done with them. Consider simply borrowing textbooks. Share with a friend or use a library copy. You won't have the same unrestricted access that you would if you bought the book, but it will be much cheaper! Some textbook shops have membership discounts. Get those if they appear cost effective, i.e. $10 lifetime membership for 10% of all textbooks, and your first textbook is $100 or more, membership has paid for itself."

Consider buying a bicycle (you can often get them used for much cheaper!) or walking to class. Some colleges include a local bus pass as part of the price of admission. Find out whether your school offers any transportation subsidies, and use them to your advantage. If you have a friend who goes to school at the same time as you, try to set up a ride-share situation. Split gas and burn less fuel. You can also use a number of carpool websites to find fellow commuters online. Consider which of these options will be most sustainable in the long term. Draw your cues from how other people get around your college. If the area is very bicycle friendly, you may want to buy a bike."

Make a list of everything you spend over a month, and then look over it at the end of the month to see where you can save money. Balance your \"fixed expenses\"\u2014recurring necessities like bills, books, rent, food\u2014with the \"fluctuating expenses\" that make your life more enjoyable. Consider putting at least half of your money (after food, bills, and other immediate necessities) into a savings account. This can be an account for fun things, for future security, or for saving up to buy something you'd like to own."

          "description":"This might seem hard for a student who is mostly cash-strapped, but a small effort might go a long way to help. You might have to budget and deal with unexpected expenses \u2013 like repairing a broken phone, or weathering a reduction in the student discount on transit passes. Whatever the surprise may be, that extra cash will save you some misery. The other reason to do this is to give yourself a financial buffer to focus on schoolwork. If school gets especially busy, you might want to take some time off of work to catch up. In this situation, the current month's paycheck may not be as juicy as the months prior \u2013 but since you have some extra, you can manage to pull through."

          "headline":"Weigh the pros and cons of a meal plan.",
          "description":"Many colleges offer meal plans so that students can  eat reasonably-priced meals at campus dining commons or affiliated restaurants. This can be an exercise in frugality: if you get a meal plan, you'll need to carefully budget how much you eat, and when. Consider whether you have a kitchen to cook your own food, or whether there are any other factors that make a meal plan irrelevant. Meal plans usually come in two forms:\n\"Meal credit\" plans: You may get a certain number of \"meals\" per semester, meaning you can enter the dining hall a pre-set number of times and eat to your heart's content. This can be a cost-effective option if you can eat large, nutritious meals when you do visit the dining commons \u2013 and maybe even sneak some food out to your dorm room. \"Debit\" plans: Some schools offer something similar to a debit account, where you pay for each individual item that you purchase. Each time you eat, your account is charged until your balance reaches zero. Loading your card up with a pre-set food budget may help you learn how to allocate your spending. Your school may also offer a combination plan with some debit and some meal credits."

Not only does it teach you how to interact with people who are working full-time, it also adds experience to your resume. Make sure that your job isn't a hindrance to your academic studies. You are, after all, a college student. Academics comes first. The jobs are just a way to facilitate your main responsibility of learning. Get a job at your college. Anything from working in the library, the IT department, the bookstore, campus dining is good experience. These jobs may not pay as much as some off-campus jobs, but they have the benefit of convenience and job security. Many campus jobs are part-time, and allow you to choose the hours that fit best with your class schedule. Get a job outside of college. Babysitting, modeling, freelance writing, secretarial work, and tutoring are all great choices. Wait tables in a restaurant or pour coffee in a cafe. Consider all of the options available to you. You might be able to make more money working off-campus, but you also might need to commute, and your employer might not always make your education the first priority."

          "description":"Internships are a great way to get working experience and save money. Ideally, look for internships that pay. Banks, law firms and big corporations generally pay students well for summer internships. If corporate life is not your thing, go for a humanities-focused internship: a building project, a curator program, or a magazine. Consider that internships often don't pay as much as full-time summer jobs, but they may give you the opportunity to do something more relevant to your goals. If you're pressed for cash, you might need to take a full-time job in construction, service, etc. Weigh the costs and benefits of taking an internship. If the internship doesn't pay, see if you can get a stipend from your school or a scholarship/grant from your home country. Alternatively, look for student grants from big NGOs and corporations. These grants help out students who do meaningful volunteer work or arts-focused internships."

Make sure that you understand all of the required fees before you open an account with a bank. Aim for zero fees so that your bank account doesn't work against you. Ask the banker which wealth growing strategies are available for college students. For instance, a popular choice is to periodically put money into a time-deposit and earn interest throughout the year. This also encourages a saving habit.

Visit your university's website and understand which choices are available to you. Understand that if you take out loans, you are putting yourself (often tens of thousands of dollars) into debt. Consider whether you want this money hanging over your head for years after you graduate \u2013 or whether you have any options. Financial aid programs usually require that you prove a low-income background. You may need to keep up a minimum GPA requirement in order to keep the money flowing, and you may need to meet other requirements; say, living on campus, or participating in certain organizations. FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) is the most common place to start applying for financial aid.
