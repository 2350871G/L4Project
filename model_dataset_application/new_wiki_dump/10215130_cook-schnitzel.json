  "text":" Making Beef Schnitzel Prepare your chopping board by covering it with plastic wrap. Take a large chopping board and any plastic wrap. Stretch the plastic wrap so it tightly covers the entire surface of the chopping board. Secure the wrap to the board by tucking the edges under the board and laying the board on a worktop or another surface. Place your steaks on the board and cover them with plastic wrap. Lay your cuts of steak on the chopping board, as close together as possible. Then use another layer of plastic wrap to secure them to the chopping board. Wrap all 4 sides of the plastic wrap under the chopping board to prevent any of the steaks juices from leaking out. Use a rolling pin to flatten the steaks. The plastic wrap will keep the steaks secured and in place as you flatten them with the rolling pin. Use as much pressure as you need to get the steaks as flat as you can. Roll the pin with the palms of your hands for a more even roll. Mix the flour and paprika with salt and pepper in a large bowl. Add your 1/3 cup (40g) of flour to the bowl and then use a spoon to add 2 teaspoons (10g) of paprika to the flour. Then sprinkle salt and pepper into the bowl. Use a spoon or a whisk to thoroughly mix the ingredients together in the bowl. The bowl should be large enough to fit the pieces of steak into it. If not, use a large container or a plate. Beat 2 eggs lightly in a large bowl. Crack both of your eggs and use a fork to lightly beat them in the bowl. For lightly beaten eggs, you should beat them well enough so the whites and yolks are slightly blended together. Add 1 1/3 cups (140g) of breadcrumbs to a separate large bowl. Make sure you add the breadcrumbs to their own bowl. They should not be added to the bowl with the eggs or to the bowl with the flour and paprika. Heat 1 teaspoon (25g) of butter and 1 teaspoon (25ml) of oil in a frying pan. It should only take a minute or so to adequately heat these ingredients. Make sure that your frying pan is large enough to fit your steaks. Dip the steaks into the 3 bowls. For best results, start with the bowl of flour, move onto the bowl of eggs, and finish with the bowl of breadcrumbs. Make sure your steaks are well covered by the ingredients in each bowl before moving onto the next bowl. Place your steaks into the frying pan for 2 minutes. Cook each of your steaks for 1 minute on each side. When the breadcrumbs turn gold and crispy, your schnitzels are ready. Serve your schnitzels. You can serve your schnitzels with lemon wedges, salad, or coleslaw, or any other food you like. If you're sprinkling more salt and pepper on the schnitzels, remember how much salt you used when making the schnitzels. It's best to eat your schnitzel when hot. To keep your schnitzel for leftovers, place your beef schnitzel in a resealable bag or a container and place it in the fridge. Consume it within 3 days after placing it in the fridge. Cooking Chicken Schnitzel Place 1 chicken breast between 2 sheets of wax paper. You can use a rolling pin to flatten the chicken breasts or you can use a meat pounder. When finished, the breasts should be around .25 inches (0.64 cm) thick. Repeat this step with your other chicken breasts. Add 2 cups (250g) of flour to a large bowl. The bowl should be large enough to allow you to dip the chicken breasts into it later. If the bowl isn't big enough, you can use a plastic container or plate. Beat 2 eggs lightly in another bowl. Crack your eggs and use a fork to lightly beat them in the bowl. For lightly beaten eggs, you should beat them well enough so the whites and yolks are slightly blended together. Mix the salt, pepper, and breadcrumbs in another bowl. Use 1/2 teaspoon (7g) of salt, 1/2 teaspoon (7g) of pepper, and 2 cups (210g) of breadcrumbs. Use a whisk or simply toss the bowl to mix the ingredients together. You want to ensure that the ingredients are well mixed so the chicken breasts are evenly covered when you dip them into the bowl later. Heat your butter and oil in a pan over medium heat. Use 2 tablespoons (30g) of butter and 1 tablespoons (15ml) of oil. It should only take a minute or so to adequately heat these ingredients. By the time you're finished dipping the breasts into your bowls of ingredients, the butter and oil should be well heated in the pan. Dip your chicken breasts into each bowl. Place the breasts into the bowl of flour first and make sure that the entire breast is evenly covered by the flour. Next, dip the breasts into the bowl with the eggs and shake off any excess. Finish by evenly coating the breasts in the bowl with salt, pepper, and breadcrumbs. Make sure the breasts are evenly and well covered by each ingredient for maximum flavor. Cook your chicken breasts for 3 minutes on each side. When the coating on the breasts turns a golden color and they look crisp, flip them over to the other side. Inspect both sides to make sure they're both the same color and have the same level of crispness. Serve your chicken breasts with lemon wedges or a salad. When both sides are the same color and texture, the breast is ready to be served. Lemon wedges will add an interesting flavor to the meal and chicken schnitzel goes well with salad. You can also add coleslaw or any sauce you like. If you want to keep your chicken schnitzel for leftovers, store it in the fridge within 2 hours after you served it. Place it in a container and consume it within 3 days after placing it in the fridge. Preparing Pork Schnitzel Trim the fat from your chops and slice them into .5 inches (1.3 cm) cutlets. The fat is much paler than the rest of the chop and feels rubbery to the touch. Use a sharp knife and slice the fat from the cutlets. Use the same knife to slice the chops to .5 inches (1.3 cm) thick pieces. Wrap your cutlets in plastic on a plastic wrap-covered cutting board. Cover your chopping board with plastic wrap, tucking the edges under the board. Lay your cutlets out across the chopping board and cover them with another layer of plastic wrap. Make sure both layers of plastic wrap are tightly wrapped under the sides of the chopping board. Use a rolling pin or meat pounder to flatten the cutlets. Use heavy pressure with your rolling pin to get the cutlets as thin as you can. When finished, your cutlets should be between .125\u2013.25 inches (0.32\u20130.64 cm) in thickness. Combine flour, salt, garlic powder, and pepper in a bowl. Add 1/3 cup (40g) of flour, 1/2 tablespoon (7g) of salt, 1/2 tablespoon (7g) of garlic powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper (7g) to the bowl. Then use either a fork or a whisk to thoroughly mix the ingredients in the bowl. The bowl should be large enough to fit each cutlet into it. Beat 3 large eggs lightly in another bowl. Crack your eggs and use a fork to lightly beat them in the bowl. For lightly beaten eggs, you should beat them well enough so the whites and yolks are slightly blended together. Add 2 cups (210g) of breadcrumbs to another bowl. Make sure you add the breadcrumbs to their own bowl. They should not be added to the bowl with the eggs or the bowl with the flour and paprika. Dip your pork cutlets into each bowl. Start by dipping the cutlets into the bowl of flour, making sure each cutlet is well covered. Move onto the next bowl and coat each cutlet in egg, shaking off any excess. Cover your cutlets in breadcrumbs by dipping them into the last bowl. Place your cutlets on a plate when finished dipping them. Place a large pan over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon (15ml) of oil. Give the oil a few minutes to heat up and reduce the heat if it's too hot. If the oil gets too hot it'll burn your cutlets. Cook the cutlets for 4 minutes on each side. Add the cutlets to the pan and flip them when the coating turns gold in color. If they brown too quickly, reduce the heat of the pan. When both sides are gold in color and crispy in texture, the cutlet is cooked. Serve the cutlets with lemon wedges, salad, or ranch dressing. Make sure both sides of your cutlets are the same color and have the same texture before serving. Pork schnitzel is a very versatile dish and can be combined with a whole host of other foods. Ranch dressing adds an interesting taste to the schnitzel. To store for leftovers, put your pork schnitzel in a container and put it in the fridge. Consume within 3 days after putting it in the fridge. Finished! ",
