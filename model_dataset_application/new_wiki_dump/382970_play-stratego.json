Your opponent should not be able to see the types of your pieces and you should not be able to see the types of your opponent\u2019s pieces. After you have set up your pieces, you are ready to play. Playing the Game Understand how gameplay works. During each of your turns, you may either move or attack an opponent\u2019s piece. You may not do both. If you find yourself in a position where you cannot move or attack, then you have lost the game and must announce your defeat to your opponent. Move your pieces. Take turns moving your pieces in vertical or horizontal directions. Pieces may not move in a diagonal direction.

But you may also win the game if your opponent reaches a point where he or she cannot make any more moves. For example, if all of the player\u2019s moveable pieces have been captured or blocked, then that player would lose the game. Using Strategy Protect your flag with Bombs. A common strategy in Stratego is to surround one\u2019s Flag with Bomb pieces to prevent players from accessing it. However, this strategy may fail if your opponent uses a miner to defuse these Bombs and then captures your Flag. If you do surround your Flag with Bombs, make sure that you have some high ranking, moveable pieces nearby to take out any approaching pieces. Keep your Miners in play. Since surrounding the Flag piece with Bombs is a popular strategy, you will benefit from keeping some of your Miner pieces in play.

Otherwise, your opponent\u2019s high-ranking pieces may take out an entire row of your low-ranking pieces before you can stop him or her. Pay attention to the positions of pieces that do not move. Stratego requires you to use your memory skills and pay attention to what pieces are where as your opponent attacks. It is also helpful to note the pieces that never move during the game. These pieces are likely to be Bombs, so you may want to send your Scouts to check them out or send Miners to defuse them.",
