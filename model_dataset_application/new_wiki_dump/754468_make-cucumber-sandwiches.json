          "description":"Traditionally, cucumber sandwiches use thin, crisp slices of cucumber with the dark green peel removed. Use a potato peeler or a small, sharp knife to shave off the peel. You can use thick slices or leave the peel on if you wish \u2014 it's up to you. The peel won't hurt you, but its texture is slightly tougher than the flesh of the cucumber."

          "description":"Drop the slices into a colander in the sink. Let them drain for about 10 minutes, then remove them to a plate and pat dry with a paper towel. Getting your cucumber slices as crisp and dry (on the outside) as possible is important for a good sandwich. Soft, wet slices of cucumber are exactly what you don't want \u2014 they'll leave you with a dull, soggy mess."

One of the nice things about putting the spread on both pieces of bread is that it traps the moisture from the cucumber slices in the middle of the sandwich so that they don't make the bread soggy. This is something you can do with many fat or oil-based spreads (like peanut butter)."

Cut the sandwich how you wish (or leave it how it is) and serve immediately. If you're serving guests, repeat the steps above for more sandwiches, working through your loaf of bread. If needed, make more spread or cut more cucumber slices. In the section below, you'll learn a few tips for \"spicing up\" the basic cucumber sandwich recipe.

A pinch or two of dried dill sprinkled into the sandwich will add some of this unique pickle-y flavor to the dish. For an eye-catching presentation, try serving the sandwiches open-faced (without the top piece of bread) and laying a single sprig of fresh dill across the cucumber slices. It'll look gorgeous (and taste great, too)."

Adding a little lemon pepper to the spread or sprinkling it over the cucumber slices gives your sandwiches just a hint of sourness, making them even more refreshing. Lemon pepper can be bought for fairly cheap at most mid- to high-end grocery stores. You can also make it yourself from lemon zest, salt, and pepper."

This will give it a slightly more savory, substantial flavor without ruining the overall smoothness that makes a cucumber sandwich so great."

        {
          "headline":"Use pumpernickel rye bread for a traditional combination.",
          "description":"Cucumber sandwiches are great with any good-quality white or wheat bread, but for an old-fashioned taste, use pumpernickel rye. Its heavy, sweet flavor contrasts well with the light, crisp bitterness of the cucumbers and the smoothness of the spread. Rye breads aren't always sold at neighborhood grocery stores, but you should be able to find it at many higher-end locations."

          "description":"Cucumbers are cool and crisp on their own, but with the added flavor and aroma of fresh mint, they're practically ice cold. Chop a few sprigs of mint and sprinkle them over the cucumbers or add them on top of each sandwich as a garnish. If you can, chop the mint into small, fine pieces. It's a little difficult to chew through whole mint leaves when they're in the middle of a sandwich."

          "headline":"Try the sandwich with Marmite spread (if you're bold).",
          "description":"Marmite is an infamous, strong-flavored spread made from yeast extract that is popular in the U.K. and some Commonwealth countries. Some people love it and some people hate it \u2014 it doesn't leave many tasters without a strong opinion. People who enjoy Marmite have been known to add it to cucumber sandwiches. If you want to try it but you've never had Marmite before, using a small amount is recommended. Marmite is often described as having a very salty taste with fishy qualities. It also has a strong odor that, to some, is unappealing."
