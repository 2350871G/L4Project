Take a sharp chef\u2019s knife and cut the jackfruit in half. You\u2019ll see a large, white central stem: cut this into small pieces and remove it."

Clearly visible segments of fruit will stand out (it\u2019ll look a little like pulled pork); grab a segment and pull it out from the jackfruit body. Tear this fruit segment open, and extract the seed. Repeat this process until you\u2019ve extracted all of the seeds from both halves of the jackfruit. Jackfruit produces a very sticky sap that will cling to your hands, clothes, knife, and cutting board, and make the process of cutting the fruit difficult. To avoid this, slather your hands and knife in vegetable oil, which will diffuse the sticky sap."

          "headline":"Boil or roast the jackfruit.",
          "description":"Jackfruit are flavorful and taste approximately like a mixture between a banana and a pineapple, with mango-like hints of flavor as well. The edible part of jackfruit is actually the fleshy pod that protects the seed. Both fleshy pods and seeds are edible. In some parts of Asia, the seed is a delicacy although it has no flavor on its own. It has a consistency of a boiled potato or boiled taro after boiling for 10\u201315 minutes (until soft), and then eat them directly. For a firmer texture, roast your seeds in the oven at 400\u00b0F (204\u00b0C) for 20 minutes. Jackfruit are difficult to peel properly; the exterior is prickly and thick, and once you cut through it, you\u2019ll find that the interior is gummy, sticky, and difficult to cut apart (as described above). When people refer to jackfruit as a fruit, they mean the deliciously fragrant fleshy pod that protects the seed. But when they refer to jackfruit as vegetable, they mean the young jackfruit that commonly sold in tins or cans that has a consistency of pulled pork, and used as vegan meat substitute. For this reason, it\u2019s easier to purchase already prepared and canned jackfruit from a grocery store or an Asian market, rather than cutting through an entire fruit on your own. In Southeast Asian cultures, jackfruit as vegetable is commonly cooked in curry or stir fries. They cook the entire fruit after cutting the prickly outer skin."

If you\u2019d like to approximate this method of cooking but don\u2019t have your own charcoal grill, you can roast the seeds in a cast-iron pan. The heat from the pan will cook the seeds consistently through. Bake the jackfruit seeds at 400\u00b0F (204\u00b0C). Use your oven light to check the seeds every 5 minutes. You\u2019ll know they are done when the jackfruit seeds break open and the fleshy fruit \u201cpops\u201d out from the inside."
