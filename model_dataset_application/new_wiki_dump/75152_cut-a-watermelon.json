  "text":" Slicing the Watermelon Wash the rind of a watermelon. Use a fruit wash if you have one, or rinse the watermelon under the faucet to remove dirt, germs, and pesticides from the watermelon rind. It\u2019s important to wash the rind because everything the knife touches on the outside of the melon will end up in contact with the watermelon flesh as it slices through. Slice off the top and the bottom of the watermelon. A serrated knife works best for items that have a softer interior and tougher exterior like melons, tomatoes, and breads. Knives must be longer than the fruit you're going to cut. Slice down through the center of the watermelon. Stand the melon on end before slicing through the middle. Note that if you cut along the dark stripes on the outside of the watermelon, then the watermelon seeds will end up on the outside of the pieces of watermelon, making them easier to remove. Cut each half into sections. You can cut each half into two, three, or four sections, depending on how small you\u2019d like your pieces to be. Remove the melon from its rind. Hold the section in one hand while you slowly cut the flesh away from the rind. Slice down from the top to the rind. You\u2019ll want to cut even slices through the fruit, about 2-3 in (5.1-7.6 cm) apart. Repeat to remove the fruit from each section. Cutting into Rounds Slice the watermelon cross-wise. You can turn your watermelon into rounds by carefully cutting through the watermelon, crosswise, at 1 in (2.5 cm) intervals. Cut off the rind. Carefully slide your knife along the outside of the flesh to cut off the rind. You may also want to remove any seeds at this point. Cut into pieces. You can either slice the rounds into sticks or triangles, or even use a cookie cutter to cut out fun shapes, like stars. Cutting Wedges Cut the watermelon in half. Find the center of the watermelon and cut through the fruit at the mid-point. Cut the halves in half. Set the fruit on your cutting board so the rind faces up and the flesh faces down, then cut each piece in half again. Slice the fruit into wedges. Take one of the quarters and slice into \u00bd in (1.3 cm) wedges. Repeat until all the fruit is cut up. Cutting into Small Pieces Quarter the watermelon. Carefully cut your watermelon in half. Then place each piece flesh-side down and cut each in half again. Slice the watermelon into wedges. Make slices 1-2 in (2.5-5.1 cm) wide across the melon, just down to the rind. Do not cut through the rind. Cut a lengthwise slice into the melon. Start on the side of the watermelon, about 1 in (2.5 cm) below the peak. Make a lengthwise slice into the melon, cutting down so that the tip of the knife runs along the rind. Continue slicing the melon. Make a lengthwise slice 1-2 in (2.5-5.1 cm) below your first cut. Don\u2019t cut all the way through the bottom. Turn the melon and repeat this process on the other side. Remove the flesh from the rind. Use your knife to slice along the bottom of the rind, using a sweeping motion. You can then pour the watermelon into a bowl or onto a serving platter. Using a Melon Baller Cut the watermelon in quarters. Find the midpoint of the watermelon and cut through it to separate your melon into halves. Then place each half on your cutting board with the rind facing up. Cut each half in half, lengthwise or crosswise. Scoop out the fruit. Use a melon baller or an ice cream scoop to scoop out the flesh of the watermelon. Place it into a bowl or Tupperware container. A seedless watermelon is best for this method, so you don\u2019t end up with seeds inside your melon balls. Alternatively, you can remove the seeds as you scoop out the fruit. Serve chilled.
