Cover the garden bed with black plastic or landscape fabric, and lay some rocks along the perimeter to keep the plastic from blowing away. You can either use large sheets of black plastic or landscaping fabric from a gardening store, or you can cut open black garbage bags and use those. Landscaping fabric is a great option if you want to reuse the material. It also allows water to trickle down to the soil below, unlike plastic. You can easily cut slits in the fabric to allow your plants to grow up through it."

You should also wait until at least two weeks after the last frost, otherwise the seeds won\u2019t sprout. If you live in a cooler climate, you can start your seeds indoors and transplant them outside once the soil warms up. Start them about two weeks before the last frost date and plant them two weeks after the last frost date."

Only water the plants during dry spells when there's no rain. Make sure that the plants do get watered once a week, either through rain or irrigation."

The mold must allow sunlight and air to pass through. To determine the size of the mold, check the seed package to find out the mature size of the fruit you're growing, and then pick a mold that\u2019s a little smaller. Make sure there's an opening in the lid for the stem, and that there's a lid that opens, closes, and latches. Glass and acrylic boxes are ideal because they allow sunlight to pass through. You can find special molds designed to grow watermelons, which are available from internet-suppliers. You can also use a wooden or metal box with lots of holes in it. Alternatively, you can make your own mold from wood, metal, or another material. If you're stuck for molds, you can also use a concrete or cinder block for the mold, but this will not yield a perfectly square watermelon."

To harvest your square watermelon, unlatch the lid and gently pull the watermelon out of the box. A watermelon is ready for harvest when the tendrils around the stem dry out, a light patch develops on the bottom of the fruit, and the fruit sounds dull and hollow when you tap on it."
