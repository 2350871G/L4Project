Ideally, the area must be free from any Spider Dens, Beefalo herds, and Frog ponds. This is because Spider Dens and Frog ponds tend to spawn hostile creatures (Spiders for the dens, Frogs for the ponds), while Beefalo tend to become hostile and attack you during mating season, a time when their rears turn red. Note that you can\u2019t sleep if you\u2019re in a dangerous area or if your hunger is too low, so only sleep if you need to regain Sanity quick and are either willing to suffer the penalty, or if you have enough food on stock."

You can craft a Straw Roll, which you can use once, early enough in the game as long as you have a Science Machine. Fur Rolls and Tents require an Alchemy Engine, which is the second available crafting station in the game. If you plan on making a Tent, seeing as it\u2019s semi-permanent (cannot be picked up without destroying it with a hammer, wears out after 6 uses), you\u2019re better off using the space as your main campsite. Tents themselves need a fairly wide space, and combined with a campfire might require a lot of space. A Straw Roll is the easiest of the bunch to create, requiring 6 Cut Grass and 1 Rope to make in a Science Machine. While both Tents and Fur Rolls are available and Fur Rolls can be brought anywhere to sleep with, Tents are more economic, since Fur Rolls not only need 1 Straw Roll but also require 2 pieces of a late-game item called Bunny Puffs found underground. A Tent only requires 6 Silk, 4 Twigs and 3 Ropes, which are readily and available on the surface."

Some clothes, while not possessing any ability to gain Sanity, have other functions.

          "description":"Eating food, aside from Monster Meats, is always a good way to recover hunger, health, and sanity. Earlier on in the game, your main source of food will be from rabbits caught in traps, berries picked from berry bushes, and carrots lying around, all of which you can cook over a campfire and eat to restore your Hunger. However, for food that restores sanity, you'll need more thorough methods. Carrots can be found poking out of the ground and Berry bushes are scattered around the world. You can pick them up by left-clicking or pressing X. To catch rabbits, make a trap with 6 Cut Grass and 2 Twigs. You can craft it in the Survival tab, represented by a looped rope icon. Once created, place it near or on top of a rabbit hole, which is a small hole in the ground found in grasslands and savannahs, then wait until a rabbit is caught. Once caught, the trap will rattle and jump around. If you pick it up, you\u2019ll get both the trap and the rabbit. You can then re-use the trap for 7 more times before it disappears. You\u2019ll need to \u201cmurder\u201d the rabbit before you can make use of the meat, though. Right-clicking (PC) it or pressing the right direction button (PS4) when a rabbit is selected will do the trick. With a Science Machine, you can also craft a Bird Trap for 3 Twigs and 4 Silk through the Survival tab. This functions similarly to a trap, but only catches birds. To make a farm plot, you need at least a Science Machine. You can make it through the Food tab, represented by a buried carrot icon, for 8 Grass, 4 Manure, and 4 Logs. You can get Manure from Beefalo, which excrete them regularly at random intervals and are found in savannahs. You can also get Manure by feeding a pig, found individually in random spots in the map or collectively in huge villages normally found at the end of roads, with some non-meat food (berries, carrots, produce from farm plots, cave bananas, etc.). Once you\u2019ve placed the farm plot, you can put a seed on it by selecting the seed and interacting with the farm. You can either wait for it to grow slowly throughout the day or pile manure on it until it grows. Once grown, simply interact with the crop to gather it, and congratulations! You now have some food!"

To make Jerky, you'll need to make a Drying Rack first, which is made with a Science Machine and requires 3 Rope, 3 Twigs, and 2 Charcoal. Charcoal can be obtained by burning down Trees. You can do this by making a Torch, equipping it, then right-clicking on the Trees. Each burned Tree can be chopped down with an Axe to get 1 Charcoal. Upon creating a Drying Rack, you can then place a piece of Meat of any kind, including Frog Legs, Batilisk Wings, and Monster Meat, by approaching the rack and using the left mouse button or X to place the meat.

The Crock Pot's cooking mechanic requires you to put in 4 items of food in the four slots to cook and takes about a minute for the dish to cook. Most meals can restore a great amount of sanity, as long as you figure out the recipe. You can use Twigs as fillers for recipe, which would usually save you from using up more important \u201cedible\u201d ingredients. Be careful when adding Monster Meats and Durians, though. Use too much without a twig, and you\u2019ll end up with a Monster Lasagna, an incredibly damaging food that gives a hefty penalty to Health and Sanity."
