Laminate flooring consists of pre-cut wooden boards that snap into place with each other. You don't need nails or screws because each piece comes with an interlocking tongue and groove. You place one row of flooring down, then snap the next row into the first one until the room is covered. You always place laminate parallel to the longest side of the room. You need to figure out exactly how wide your final row of laminate will be, as it is rare that the rows will all fit perfectly right out of the box. Measure the dimensions of the room.

Take your longest width and divide it by the width of your planks or tiles. For example, if the width is 267 inches wide and the planks are 6 inches wide, you would get 44.5 planks. This number means that you need 44 and half of your six-inch planks to cover the entire width of a 268-inch floor. Use this measurement to plan the first and last row of flooring. This is often the hardest part about setting up your new floor. In the previous example, you needed 44.5 planks to cover your flooring. This means that there will be half a plank missing if you only laid down 44 pieces of tile/laminate, so you need to cut one row in half to make everything fit. To find the width of your last piece, multiply the decimal from your calculation by your plank width. For example, pretend you are using 8-inch wooden planks and you need 20.65 of them to cover the width of the floor. This means you need 20 normal rows, plus one row cut to 5.2 inches (.65 x 8 = 5.2).

You want to lay your first row parallel to the longest side of the room. Start on the side of the room with a door to make installation easiest. Chose the shortest side of the room with a door if there are multiple. Measure and cut the end pieces. It is rare that your flooring will fit your room perfect. Lay the plank sunny-side down (the side you will see) and use a band saw to cut it into the appropriate length. Remember that your need to keep \u00bd inch space between the plank and the wall. The cut side of the board always goes against the wall. Use the remainder of the plank from the end of row one to start row two. This ensures that the joints of the wood do not match up. For a better look and a sturdier floor, the horizontal joints of your laminate should be at least 6-12 inches apart. If you have no remainder, or the remaining piece is too small, cut a piece of the laminate so that it is 2/3 the length of the piece next to it, then start with that. This will prevent the joints from lining up too much. Fit the second row in so that the tongues interlock with the grooves from the previous row. Snap the laminate together. Continue this process until you\u2019ve covered the whole floor. Lay down the laminate, snap it into place, measure and cut the end piece, and repeat. If you did all of your measuring correctly in the beginning, this should fly by. Slide any laminate underneath doorjambs. Vary the joint length by 6-12 inches. Remember to keep 1/2-inch spacers between the wall and flooring. Reinstall the baseboards when you\u2019ve finished. This is the final step for your new flooring. Simple re-adhere your old baseboards, or buy and install new ones. Measure the square footage of your room. Square footage is as simple as multiplying the length of the room by the width. Bring this number to your tile dealer to determine how many tiles you need. Always buy 10% more tiles than you need in case some break or you need to make repairs. Know that you generally start tiling in the middle of the room. This ensures that you have nice, full-length tiles in the center of the room and cut tiles along the fringes. In order to make this possible, however, you have to make several careful measurements to determine where the middle of the room is, how many tiles you need on each side, and the length of your end tiles. Find the midpoints of each wall. Find the midpoint of each wall by measuring the length and dividing by two. Mark this midpoint on each wall. Drop chalk lines from every midpoint to the center of the room. Where these lines cross should be the starting point of your tile. It is the center of the room. Put a tile on these lines so that two edges of the tile are lined up with the chalk. Use a yardstick or level to make sure the line is straight. Place a row of tiles from the center line to two different walls. Do not use mortar. This is your test run to determine how many tiles you are going to need. Start with your center tile and place the tiles against each other towards perpendicular walls. You should have two \"half rows\" when you are done. There will likely be space between your last tile and the wall. Don't worry, as you will be able to deal with this later. Be sure to place spacers in between the tiles so that you have the correct distance. Measure the distance between your last tile and the wall. Unless you are very lucky, you will likely have a space between the wall and your last tile where you cannot fit another tile. Record this number as \"end tile width.\" Repeat this process for both rows of practice tiles. Since you started in the center, the opposite side will have the opposite width. If, for example, you have 1/3 if a tile to go on one side, the other side will have 2/3 of a tile remaining. Adjust your center point if your \"end tile width\" is less than 1/3 of your normal tile width. It is difficult to cut very small tiles without breaking them, and incredibly thin tiles often look bad.However, you can move your center point to prevent this from happening. For example, you might be using 12\" tiles, and your end tile width is only 2\". If you move your center tile 4\" away from this wall then you suddenly have an end tile width of 6\" on both sides, making it easier to cut. Cut your end tiles. Once you\u2019ve made your measurements, count the number of tiles in your rows \u2013 you will need the same number on the opposite wall. Take your marked tiles and cut them along the line you marked when making measurements. This is how you will need to cut every tile along the ends to make sure they all fit. If the last tile is only going to be 1-2 inches thick, move your center line back 2 inches and re-measure it so that you have a nice wide tile at the end. Do a \u201cdry run\u201d of the tiles. Starting at your mid-point, lay out your tiles towards each wall of the room. Verify your measurement by laying out a row of tiles and adjust the guidelines as needed. Do not skip this test run, as it is crucial to laying down even tiles. When installing ceramic tiles, insert the plastic spacers to allow room for grout. Mix your mortar. Following the directions on the bag, mix your mortar and water in a 5-gallon bucket. You will likely need an electric drill with a mixing paddle to properly mix everything, as the mortar is thick. Start with a small bucket of mortar \u2013 if you wait too long to apply it in can become hard and useless. Wipe the paddle off as soon as you finish mixing to prevent it from drying onto the drill. Let the mortar stand undisturbed for 5-10 minutes. Mix and match tiles from different boxes. Tiles often have subtle color changes and variations depending on when they were manufactured. Don't start with one box and then move on to the next one. Instead, take several tiles out of each box and mix them up before beginning. If your tiles have direction arrows on the bottom make sure that they all face the same way during installation. Apply your mortar with a notched trowel for your first tile. Scoop out a generous amount of mortar and spread it on the floor in front of you using the flat side. Then take the notched end of the trowel and scrape it across the mortar. Notice the grooves in the mortar lines \u2013 these will help distribute the mortar and hold the tile in place. Only apply enough mortar for 2-3 tiles to begin tiling. Make sure you start tiling in a corner of the room that allows you to exit the room without stepping on any tiles. Place your first tile. Make sure that the tile is squared up with the wall and your chalk lines, then firmly push it down and into the mortar. It is often easiest to start in the center of the room, near your chalk lines, but you can only do this is if you measured out the distance to the wall first and calculated the width of the end tiles ahead of time. Use a straight-edge to set the rest of the tiles in a row. A straightedge is a heavy, long ruler that helps ensure your tiles are level with each other. Place it along the edge of your first tile, and then lay down the rest. Use plastic spacers to ensure the tiles are the right distance apart. Keep laying down tiles 2-3 at a time. Place enough mortar for a few tiles, press them, and repeat. Scrape up any excess mortar that leaks out from under the tiles as your work. Bumps of mortar will make it harder to lay tiles later on, so take the time to clean up and excess liquid before it hardens. Allow the tiles to set overnight. Once you\u2019ve finished putting on the tiles, leave the floor and return the next day to finish the job. Check the mortar to see how long it needs to set, but you wait roughly 24 hours before continuing. Mix your grout in a 5-gallon bucket. Similar to the mortar, mix the grout following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Apply the grout along the joints in the tile with a rubber grout float. This tool, available for rent at most tool shops, allows you to evenly spread the grout into all the cracks. When done, use it to remove as much excess grout from the tiles as possible so that most of the grout is in between the cracks of the tiles, not on top of them. Allow the grout to dry before wiping it with a wet sponge. After 20 minutes or so, use a wet sponge to clean of your tiles, leaving the grout in between the joints. Wait 72 hours before walking on your new tile floor. The grout needs time to harden and set, so avoid foot traffic or you could slide your tiles around. After several weeks, you may want to apply a grout sealer to prevent water damage.",
