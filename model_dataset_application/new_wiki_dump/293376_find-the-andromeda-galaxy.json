You can often find star charts for free online. They are also sometimes sold at planetariums or by astronomical societies. The star chart may also tell you what the best of time night to see the Andromeda Galaxy is based on the season. For example, in September and October, the Andromeda Galaxy will rise in the eastern sky of the northern hemisphere. By midnight, it should be directly above your head. If you live in the southern hemisphere, you might look towards the northern horizon in December to see it. It may not rise high in the sky."
