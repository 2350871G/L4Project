          "description":"Cilantro should be pruned often to encourage new growth. Older, larger cilantro leaves also tend to be more bitter in flavor, making the herb less desirable if it is left to grow out. When your cilantro plant reaches 6 inches (15 cm), start trimming away stems to use as needed. Add fresh cilantro to salads, soups, salsa, guacamole, and other dishes. It will usually take 60-75 days after planting for your cilantro to be this height."
