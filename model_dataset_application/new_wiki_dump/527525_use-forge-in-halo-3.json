Edit the Forge session's rules and properties, such as player speed and strength, by pressing X in the pre-game screen.

This guide deals with controls in the editor mode. Look around in Forge. This can be done by rotating or moving the Right Joystick. Additionally, pressing the Right Joystick allows you to zoom in. Move around, which can be done by rotating or moving the Left Joystick. Keep in mind that in editor mode you can fly, so movement is not limited to the ground. Use the Left and Right Joysticks to get to where ever you need to go; it is particularly easy to get to places you can't reach in player form now.  Strafe up in editor mode by pressing or holding the Right Bumper on your controller. This will move your character directly up. Strafe down in editor mode by pressing or holding the Left Bumper on your controller. This will move your character directly down. Use 'Thrust' in Forge by holding down the Left Trigger in combination with the Left Joystick (used for movement). This will move you faster through the map than by using the Left Joystick alone.
