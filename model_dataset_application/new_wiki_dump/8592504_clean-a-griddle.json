Different griddles are meant to be cleaned at different temperatures. Different griddle soaps, likewise, are intended for use at different ideal temperatures. Check both your griddle\u2019s user manual and the griddle soap you obtained to determine what temperature you should set your griddle to. It will be easier to clean your griddle when you\u2019ve just used it, before it\u2019s cooled, than it will be to try and clean the griddle after the bits of whatever you\u2019ve been cooking have caked onto its surface."

Use a back-and-forth or up-and-down scrubbing motion when scrubbing your griddle. You could move from top to bottom, or from bottom to top. If you\u2019re scrubbing your griddle with an up-and-down motion, you could move from right to left or from left to right as you scrub. Attach the drip tray if your griddle does not have one permanently attached. Place a bowl or small container beneath the drip tray\u2019s drain to catch the water you use to scrub the griddle. Dip your sponge or griddle brush into the water frequently during the cleaning process. This ensures the griddle receives a steady application of soapy water. If a moderate level of force is not removing gunk from the griddle, apply pressure more firmly when scrubbing."
