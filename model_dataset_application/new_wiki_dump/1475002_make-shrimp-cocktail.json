  "text":" Making the Court Bouillon Prepare court bouillon for a tastier shrimp cocktail. You've probably heard of bouillon cubes, right? They're added to hot water to make it more flavorful. Although you certainly don't need to make court bouillon, the addition of wine, herbs, and other seasonings takes this shrimp cocktail dish a couple steps closer to perfection. Add all the ingredients to a large, covered pot and bring to a boil. Don't worry about tying a bouquet garni. Just plop everything into your pot and bring to a boil. Stir once or twice to make sure that all the ingredients are well incorporated. Allow the court bouillon to boil for 20 extra minutes for a more intensely flavored broth. Making the Cocktail Sauce and Shrimp While the court bouillon is coming together, assemble your cocktail sauce. In a medium bowl, mix together ketchup, chili sauce, horseradish, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, and salt. Stir until evenly mixed. Once mixed, cover cocktail sauce with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator. Allow to chill while the shrimp cook. Decide whether to cook with fresh or frozen shrimp. While fresh shrimp are superior in taste and texture, frozen shrimp can be perfectly acceptable if that's all you got. Just make sure to factor in extra cooking time if you do decide to use frozen shrimp. Cook shrimp with their shells if possible.
