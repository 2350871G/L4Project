  "text":" Cream cheese wedge mouse Use cream cheese already shaped into little quarters or wedges. These are often of European origin and come in an array of tasty flavors, wrapped in foil. (For example, Laughing Cow Swiss cheese wedges.) Remove the foil from the quarter.  Add ears. Cut small slivers of sausage (meat or vegetarian) to make the ears. Insert at the pointed tip end of the wedge, which is the face end of the mouse. Add eyes. Add small black sesame seeds, pepitas, or flecks of olives for the eyes. Add a nose. Cut a small piece of olive with the end of a straw and add the circle to the tip of the wedge. Add the tail. For example, a piece of chive stem or a length of pretzel. If you have the ability to make long curls from vegetables, use carrot or celery curls for the tail. Place the mouse on the cheeseboard. It's now ready to serve. Bocconcini style mouse Use soft cheese with an oval shape for this style. For example, a small mozzarella or bocconcini cheese shape. Slice very think round slivers of radish. Insert these into the head end of the cheese, to form ears. Add eyes. Use sultanas or raisins for eyes. Alternatively, cut small slivers of olives to serve as eyes. (An easy way to cut the olive is to pierce it with the end of a straw, to make a perfect circle.) Add the nose. Use a sultana or a peppercorn for a nose. Place a tail on the mouse.
