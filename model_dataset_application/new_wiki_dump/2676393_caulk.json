          "description":"There are two main types of caulk \u2013 silicone and acrylic latex. Silicone caulk is a completely waterproof and flexible sealant. It will bond with a lot of different kinds of surfaces. Silicone is a good choice if you\u2019re caulking outdoors, or wet indoor spots like around shower stalls and bathtubs. It\u2019s quite expensive and doesn\u2019t do well in high-traffic areas. Silicone caulk is ideal for areas of high moisture that need to remain mildew-free. Silicone caulk can also be useful when you need to adhere surfaces, like fastening countertops to walls or putting a top on a vanity. Silicone caulk is typically only available in three shades \u2013 clear, white, and almond. Silicone caulk cannot be painted over."

          "description":"Acrylic latex caulk is easier to use and cheaper than silicone. It can be used for a wider range of projects and it comes in a rainbow assortment of colors to match bathtub and sink glazes. Acrylic latex is water-based so it\u2019s best used indoors. It is not as durable as silicone caulk and won\u2019t last as long. Since acrylic latex is water-based, it is possible to paint over it. Acrylic latex caulk shrinks up more than silicone. It also dries much harder. Unless specifically noted on the packaging, latex caulk isn't suitable for any exterior surfaces. Acrylic latex caulk is not suitable for tiling or areas with direct sunlight."

          "headline":"Remove existing caulk from your work surface.",
          "description":"Old caulk must be removed before you add more. Use a utility knife, razor scraper or painter\u2019s tool to cut away existing caulk. Use quick, sharp strokes. Keep in mind that metal blades aren\u2019t ideal to use around plastic fixtures. Use a tool with a plastic razor blade, which you can get at any home improvement store, to avoid damaging the plastic. For concrete and masonry applications, use a wire brush for removal. Home improvement stores sell caulk remover products that will chemically remove old caulk. Keep in mind that these products will damage plastic surfaces. For silicone caulk, you may just need to rip up enough that you can grab an end with a pair of needlenose pliers. Then, you can pull the caulk out in one long strip."

          "headline":"Clean the surface.",
          "description":"Use a brush or vacuum to remove any remaining debris from the work area. Scour the surface clean with a dry, nonabrasive sponge or pad. Use rubbing alcohol to remove soap scum and body oils from a bathtub or shower stall. Dry the area completely before you begin caulking. Both kinds of caulk need a clean surface, but if you\u2019re using silicone, it\u2019s imperative that you remove all debris and residue from the surface before you begin. For silicone clean up, soak a rag with mineral spirits (such as turpentine) and wipe the surface down with it. Then use a damp rag to wipe the surface down again."

The painter\u2019s tape acts as a guide to ensure your caulk lines are straight and uniform. The end result will look more polished and professional if you use painter's tape."

Solid-shaft caulk guns produce very smooth lines and generally get better results. Solid-shafts are a better choice than notched-shaft caulk guns."

The further down on the nozzle you make the cut, the wider the bead will be. For quick, basic jobs, trim the end of the nozzle straight across. Cut the nozzle at a 45-degree angle if you need more precision and control. Check inside the nozzle for a foil seal. If it does have a foil seal, use something sharp and narrow (like a long nail) to puncture it."

Situate the tube base into the gun first. Then tilt the nozzle end of the tube into the top part of the gun. Turn the hooked rod so that the hooked part is facing up and the side with the teeth is facing down. Gently squeeze the trigger to get the caulk flowing and then it\u2019s ready to use."

Keep squeezing the trigger gently as you go to ensure a continuous release of caulk. Move the gun at a steady speed. The caulk will form \"beads\" as it emerges. Try to get one continuous, even bead along each length. Keep a damp rag (dipped in water or mineral spirits) handy, for fast wiping of mistakes. It is always better to use less caulk than too much. You can always add more on a second pass. To stop the flow of caulk, press the button under the shaft behind the needle. This will relieve tension to the gun and avoid a mess."

If the caulk bead already looks neat and uniform, leave it alone. If it needs to be smoothed out, use a caulking tool, a putty knife, your finger (dampen it first) or a damp rag to pull along the joint and press the caulk smooth. It is far easier to neaten caulk as you go, while it is still damp. Get to it within two to five minutes of application for best results. If you don't stop frequently to neaten the caulk, the earlier portions might dry before you can neaten or mend errors. You\u2019ll have to scrape off dried caulk if you want to neaten it."

Do this carefully and try to avoid touching the fresh caulk. You can pull the tape up immediately after you create the bead if you like, but definitely get it up within a few hours. If you go any longer, the caulk could skin over. Allow the caulk at least 24 hours to cure before disturbing it or getting it wet."
