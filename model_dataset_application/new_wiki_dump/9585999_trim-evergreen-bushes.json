You can purchase bags specifically made for disposing of yard waste from any home improvement store. Put on gardening gloves. Purchase gloves specifically designed for gardening at any gardening or home improvement store. These protect your hands and keep them relatively clean while you work. Removing Old Growth Cut off any damaged or dead branches. Any branches that are discolored, bare, or limp need to be removed. Take the branch in 1 hand and use your other hand to cut it off at the base of the stem with your pruners. If the base of a stem is particularly thick or tough, try using larger shears or a small hacksaw. Wipe down the blade of your pruners with rubbing alcohol after you cut off a diseased branch. This will help prevent the disease from spreading to other branches. Shorten overly long branches. Some branches of the bush will most likely have grown quite a bit longer than the others. Use the pruners to trim these back significantly, so that they\u2019re closer to the size of the adjacent branches. Once all the overly long branches have been trimmed, you should be able to see the natural shape of the plant more clearly. Remove one third of the old wood at the ground level. There will probably be some areas that look overcrowded with branches, especially near the bottom of the bush. By removing about one third of this wood, you\u2019ll give your bush a cleaner look. This also makes room for new branches to grow in. Shaping the Bush Start at the top and work your way down. In general, this will help you to shape the bush properly. Branches at the top should be shorter than branches at the bottom. If you start at the bottom, you might accidentally make those branches shorter than they should be. When you\u2019re done, the bush should appear wider at the bottom than it does at the top. Trim all the branches on the top to roughly the same length. However, don\u2019t focus on making them all exactly the same size. To keep the natural shape of the plant, allow some variation between the branches. Cut the branches in the middle so that they're longer than those on top. To make sure your plant gradually flares out towards the bottom, leave the branches in the middle slightly longer than the branches on top. Leave the branches on the bottom longer than the others. Evergreen bushes should taper towards the top and flare out at the bottom. As you move down the bush, allow the branches in each section to be slightly longer than the branches above them. When you\u2019re done, the bottom of the bush should appear wider than the top. The shape should be somewhat like a cone or a trapezoid. Avoid cutting the bushes so that their sides look flat. In most cases, evergreens should have a natural shape rather than a flat or geometric one. Never try to cut all branches so that they\u2019re the same length. This is why small hand pruners are more effective than larger shears. Fertilize your bushes after pruning. Now that you\u2019ve cleared the old branches and shaped the bush, help the plant grow by adding some fertilizer to the soil around its base. Use a fertilizer that is rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Purchase fertilizer at your local gardening store or home improvement store.",
