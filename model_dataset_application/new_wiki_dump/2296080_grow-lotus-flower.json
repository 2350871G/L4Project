          "description":"Using a standard metal file, scrape the hard seed casing to reveal the cream-colored core. Do not file any of the core away or else your lotus will not grow. Filing away the outer casing allows water to reach the core. If you don't have a metal file handy, you can use any sharp knife or even rub the seed against concrete. Just be careful not to scrape away too much of the seed."

Fill the container with dechlorinated water between 75 and 80 \u00b0F (24 and 27 \u00b0C). After a day of soaking, the seeds will sink to the bottom and swell to nearly twice their original size. Seeds that float are almost always infertile. Remove them or they will cloud up the water. Change the water daily, even after the seeds have started to sprout. When you remove the seedlings to change the water, treat the sprouts with care \u2013 they are very delicate."

          "description":"This size typically provides enough room for a young lotus to grow. A black plastic bucket will retain heat to better warm the seedlings. Ideally, your soil should be 2 parts clay and 1 part river sand. If you use commercial potting soil to topsoil for houseplants, it will float to the surface once you submerge your tub in water. Make sure the container you choose does not have any drainage holes. The plant may gravitate toward the drainage hole and begin growing outside of it, causing the plant to underperform."

If you wait too long, your seedlings will start to grow leaves. You can still plant them \u2013 just take care to keep the leaves free of the soil."

          "description":"You don't have to bury the seeds in the soil. Set them just on top, then brush a light layer of soil over them to secure them. They will take root on their own. It can be a good idea to wrap a small amount of modeling clay around the bottom of each seed to anchor it with a little weight. When you lower your container into the pond, an unanchored seed may find its way out of the soil and float up to the surface of the water."

          "description":"Lotus are aquatic plants, so the soil should always have at least 2 to 4 inches (5.1 to 10.2 cm) of water above it. If you have taller plants, the water can be up to 18 inches (46 cm) deep. Dwarf lotus need water between 2 and 12 inches (5.1 and 30.5 cm) deep. The water should be at least 70 \u00b0F (21 \u00b0C). If you live in an area with a relatively cooler climate, shallower water will provide extra warmth for your lotus. Lotus grown from seed rarely bloom in their first year. You should also keep fertilizer to a minimum during this first year. Allow your lotus to acclimate to its environment."

Because of difficulty shipping, they are typically not available after they break dormancy in late spring. However, you may be able to buy some that have been grown locally. For rarer hybrids, you may have to shop online. If there is a water gardening society with a chapter near you, ask them for recommendations. Some societies also sell plants themselves."

If you're planning on moving the lotus to a pond, use water from the pond (as long as it's warm enough). Change the water every 3 to 7 days, or if it starts to appear cloudy."

A deep container will decrease the chance that your lotus spills over the top and spreads across the pond. Round containers keep your lotus from getting jammed up in a corner, which can stunt or kill the plant."

Leave about 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) between the top of the soil and the rim of your container. You can also use amended soil, with a separate layer of sand 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) deep on top.

Once your tuber is secured in place, you can lower it into the location you've chosen to plant your lotus. Once seated in the pond, the tuber plants itself by turning downward into the soil mixture and growing roots."

Ideally, the air temperature should be at least 70 \u00b0F (21 \u00b0C) as well. The lotus will start to send up leaves after a few days in water above 70 \u00b0F (21 \u00b0C). It blooms after 3 to 4 weeks in water above 80 \u00b0F (27 \u00b0C). Check your water temperature every other day.

          "description":"Lotus plants thrive in full sun, requiring at least 5 to 6 hours of direct sunlight per day. If your pond is partially shaded, you may want to prune or remove surrounding foliage that blocks out the sun. In North America, the lotus typically blooms from mid-June or mid-July through early autumn. The blossoms open early in the morning and start closing mid-afternoon. Individual blossoms last 3 to 5 days, then molt. The process repeats through the remaining months of active growth."

Wait until your tuber has developed at least 6 leaves before fertilizing it, and don't place the fertilizer directly against the tuber itself. Small lotus varieties only need 2 tablets, while larger varieties may need as many as 4. Add fertilizer once every 3 or 4 weeks, stopping in mid-July. If you continue to fertilize your lotus past this point, it won't be able to prepare for dormancy. If you grew your lotus from seed, don't fertilize it during its first year."

Applying a small amount of powdered pesticide directly to the leaves will protect your lotus plant from these pests. Liquid pesticides, even organic ones, have oils and detergents that can damage your lotus."

The tuber should at least be below the frost line, a depth that varies depending on where you live. If your pond is relatively shallow, you can remove the container and leave it in a garage or basement until spring. Mulch around any above-ground pots to keep the tubers warm."

Replace it in your pond at the same depth it was before. If your lotus took over your pond the previous year, inspect the container for cracks. You may want to get a larger container to better hold the lotus, if it grew over the rim."
