They work a little differently in Generation IV though; the Luxury Ball only gives a bonus when leveling up and walking, and the Soothe Bell will give a 50% boost to all Friendship activities. Walk with Pichu in your party. Like Generation III, you'll gain 1 Friendship every 256 steps. You'll gain a bonus if your Pichu is in a Luxury Ball. Get your Pichu a massage. There are a couple of different massage locations that can give you a Friendship boost. You can only get one massage every 24 hours. Diamond, Pearl, Platinum - The massage girl in Veilstone City will give you a 3-point boost. Diamond, Pearl, Platinum - A massage at the Ribbon Syndicate will give you a 20-point(!) boost if your Friendship is less than 100. Black and White - A massage from the lady on Castelia Street can give you up to 30 Friendship points. Black 2 and White 2 - The massage lady can be found at the Medal Office, and gives the same bonuses as the one from Black and White. Use Vitamins to gain Friendship. Like the previous Generations, Vitamin items will give you a good Friendship boost. No new Vitamins were introduced in Generation IV or V. Level Pichu up for a Friendship boost. You'll get a few Friendship points every time Pichu levels up Use EV-lowering berries. EV-lowering berries can give you a big boost in Friendship. Give your Pichu Pomeg, Kelpsy, Qualot, Hondew, Grepa, or Tamato berries for up to 10 Friendship, depending on the current Friendship level. Don't let Pichu get knocked out. Like all other Generations, getting knocked out will lower Pichu's Friendship by 1. Switch Pichu out with another Pok\u00e9mon if it looks like it's going to faint. Don't use any healing items on Pichu. Healing items have a major negative effect on your Friendship, and it can take a while to make the loss back. Avoid the following items, and do all of your healing at a Pok\u00e9mon Center instead:\nEnergy Powder: -5 points\nHeal Powder: -5 points\nEnergy Root: -10 points\nRevival Herb: -15 points Check your Pichu's Friendship (Generation IV). If you're playing the Generation IV games, you can check Pichu's happiness by visiting the Pok\u00e9mon Fan Club in Hearthome City. Make sure Pichu is the first Pok\u00e9mon in your party. The phrase that the checker says will change depending on Pichu's Friendship level, and the phrases for Platinum are different. 50 - 99: \"You should treat it better. It's not used to you.\" (D,P) \"It's feeling neutral toward you. It's up to you to change that.\" (Plat)\n100 - 149: \"It's quite cute.\" (D,P) \"It's warming up to you. That's my impression.\" (Plat)\n150 - 199: \"It's friendly towards you. It looks sort of happy.\" (D,P) \"It's quite friendly to you. It must be happy being with you.\" (Plat)\n200 - 254: \"I get the feeling that it really trusts you.\" (D,P) \"It's very friendly toward you. I can tell you treat it kindly.\" (Plat)\n255: \"It looks really happy! It must love you a lot.\" (D,P) \"It simply adores you! Why, I feel like I am intruding!\" (Plat) Check your Pichu's Friendship (Generation V). If you're playing the Generation V games, you can find the Friendship checker at the Pok\u00e9mon Fan Club in Icirrus City. The phrase will change depending on Pichu's Friendship level:\n70 - 99: \"The relationship is neither good nor bad\u2026 It looks neutral.\" 100 - 149: \"It is a little friendly to you\u2026 That's what I'm getting.\" 150 - 194: \"It is friendly to you. It must be happy with you.\" 195 - 254: \"It is quite friendly to you! You must be a kind person!\" 255: \"It is super friendly to you! I'm a bit jealous!\" Level Pichu up once you think it is at Friendship level 220 or higher. Since you won't know the exact number unless you're checking in every time you raise your friendship, you'll have to guess based on the phrase and the actions you perform. When you level up Pichu when it has a Friendship of 220 or greater it will evolve immediately into Pikachu. If Pichu doesn't evolve when leveled up, then its Friendship is not at 220 yet. Generation VI Capture the Pichu in a Luxury Ball. Like all the previous Generations, a Luxury Ball will provide a bonus to Friendship gained for certain activities. Perform Friendship raising activities where you first captured Pichu. A new addition to Generation VI Friendship is the bonus you get for performing Friendship-raising activities in the same spot you captured Pichu. This applies to using Vitamins, Rare Sodas, and EV-lowering berries. Walk with Pichu in your party. You can get 2 Friendship points for walking 128 steps, but in Generation VI games you'll get the points less than 50% of the time. Take your Pichu to get a Massage. In X and Y, you can find the massage lady in the house to the left of the Pok\u00e9mon Center in Cyllage City. In Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, you can find a groomer to the north of the Poke Miles shop in Mauville City. Massages have a 6% chance of giving you a 30-point boost. Use Vitamins. Like all Pok\u00e9mon games, Vitamins will boost your Friendship by up to 5 (plus any bonuses). No new Vitamins have been introduced since Generation III. Use Wings to get a small boost. Wings are items that are similar to Vitamins, but a little less powerful. They can be found randomly on the Driftveil Drawbridge and Marvelous Bridge. Wings can give you up to 3 Friendship. Level Pichu up by fighting. When Pichu levels up in battle, you'll gain up to 5 Friendship. In Generation VI, levels attained by Rare Candy will not be rewarded with a Friendship Bonus Take Pichu Super Training. Use the Super Training feature in Generation VI to boost Pichu's Friendship. You'll need to complete a few Regimens to unlock the Soothing Bag, which can give you a 20-point boost to your Friendship. Drink juices from the Juice Shoppe. The Juice Shoppe in Lumiose City sells a variety of different juices, and a few of them will increase your Friendship. You'll need berries to create the juices. Rare Soda - 1 Lansat and 1 Starf Berry\nColorful Shake - Any two berries\nUltra Rare Soda - 1 Roseli and 1 Enigma\nAny colored juice Don't let Pichu get knocked out. Getting knocked out will drop your Friendship by 1, so make sure to pull Pichu out if its about to faint. Don't use any healing items on Pichu. Avoid healing items. The healing items in the game can have a big negative impact on your Friendship. Do all of your healing at the Pok\u00e9mon Center. The second value below applies if your Friendship is over 200. Energy Powder: -5/-10 points\nHeal Powder: -5/-10 points\nEnergy Root: -10/-15 points\nRevival Herb: -15/-20 points Check your Friendship level. You can find an estimation of your Pichu's Friendship level by visiting the checker in the Pok\u00e9mon Fan Club in Laverre City. Make sure Pichu is the first Pok\u00e9mon in your party. If you're playing Omega Ruby or Alpha Sapphire, see the Generation III instructions. 50 - 99: \"Hmm\u2026I think you have a lot of time ahead of you to get to know one another better.\" 100 - 149: \"It's a little bit friendly to you\u2026 Something like that.\" 150 - 199: \"Well, I think you and Pichu will be an even greater combo someday!\" 200 - 254: \"You must really like your Pichu and always keep it by your side!\" 255: \"It's amazingly friendly toward you! It must be so happy spending every day with you!\" Level up Pichu once you think it's at 220 Friendship. You'll have to guess since the checker only tells you the range you're in. You can level Pichu up through battle or by using a Rare Candy, Rare Soda, or Ultra Rare Soda. If Pichu doesn't evolve, its Friendship is not 220.",
