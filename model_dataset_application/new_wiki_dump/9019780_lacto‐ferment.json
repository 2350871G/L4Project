For instance, if you are grating vegetables, the knife you use should differ from one that is best suited to slicing or chopping. Paring knives are good for small, short, and precise tasks like peeling or trimming off vegetable skin. Serrated knives are good for slicing veggies. They have scalloped edges and should give you a smooth, clean slice. A chef\u2019s knife can be used for many purposes, but is best when working with large produce like spaghetti squash or pumpkin."

          "headline":"Get some weights.",
          "description":"While it is not absolutely necessary to keep your veggies completely submerged during the lacto-fermentation process, doing so will encourage probiotic growth and prevent mold. To accomplish this, you will need to add a small weight to the glass canning jar to press down on whatever you\u2019re fermenting. The weight should have the same (or nearly the same) diameter of the jar you\u2019re using. The best weights will be of dense but thin glass. This way, they will consume a minimal amount of room inside the glass canning jar. Avoid using limestone weights, as they can dissolve in the acidic environment of the glass canning jar. Do not use wooden weights, as they will expand in the aqueous environment."

You might have such an object at home \u2013 a rolling pin with one handle removed works well \u2013 or you could buy a product specifically designed to compact veggies for lacto-fermentation."

Once your veggies are ready, pack them in the glass canning jar, leaving enough room to add your weight (if you\u2019re using one).
