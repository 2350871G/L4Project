  "text":" Playing Spin the Bottle Ask everyone to sit in a circle. No chairs are required, just have everyone sit on the ground. Try to arrange everyone in a boy-girl-boy-girl pattern. Place the bottle in the middle of the circle. Lay the bottle on its side. If the circle is large, players might need to get up and go to the middle of the circle to spin the bottle. If it isn\u2019t too big then you should be able to just lean forward and spin it. Spin the bottle. Grabbing the bottle around the middle with your thumb and index finger, rotate your wrist sharply and then release to give the bottle a spin. Kiss the person that the bottle points to when it stops spinning. Whoever is closest to where the bottle is pointing when it stops spinning is the person that the bottle spinner has to kiss. Spin again. Whoever is seated to the right of the last bottle spinner goes next. Keep playing until everyone in the circle has had a chance to spin the bottle. Playing Suck and Blow Get a playing card or index card. You can also use a piece of construction paper or cardstock as long as you trim it down to the size of a playing card. Just remember that the card needs to be large enough to completely cover your mouth. Ask everyone to stand in a circle. Arrange everyone in a boy-girl-boy-girl pattern. The circle should be fairly tight, since a card will be passed from mouth to mouth in this game. Start the game. The person with the card must suck gently on the card to keep it on his or her lips. While sucking, the card holder must attempt to pass it to the next person using only his or her mouth. No hands are allowed in this game! Pass the card or kiss. Press the card against the lips of the person next to you and keep sucking. Keep the paper in place until the next person makes contact with it. Then blow gently on the paper to release it to the next person. If the paper falls, those two have to kiss. Rotate the girls. Every time the card drops, the girls must rotate one space to the left so that they are standing next to one new boy. This rotation will keep the game exciting by constantly changing the person next to the players. Keep playing until the card has made a full rotation around the circle or until everyone has kissed someone. Playing Seven Minutes in Heaven Write all of your guests\u2019 names on small pieces of paper. Fold them up so that the names are hidden, but keep the boys\u2019 names separate from the girls names. Put the pieces of paper into two hats. Put all of the girls\u2019 names into one hat and all of the boys\u2019 names into another hat. Draw a name from each hat. Mix up the names before you draw a name from each hat. As you pull out each name, read it aloud to your guests. Send those two people into the closet together. If you don\u2019t have a large enough closet, you can send them into a small dark room, like a bathroom or laundry room. Just make sure that the lighting is dim and they are in somewhat close quarters. Set a timer for seven minutes. Use a stopwatch or just watch the clock for seven minutes. Let them out when the timer is up. Draw new names. Keep the game going by drawing new names. Place the names that you have already drawn to the side so that all of your guests have a turn. Playing Post Office Gather everyone into a room. Make sure the room has a door that the \u201cpostman\u201d can knock on and enter through. Send one person out of the room. You can choose the person who has to leave the room and knock on the door to reenter at random or ask for volunteers. Choose someone to answer the door when they knock. Again, you can choose the person at random or ask for volunteers. Someone may want to volunteer if they like the person who has left the room and want to kiss him or her. Tell the postman and door opener to kiss. When the door is opened, the two people standing on either side of it have to kiss. Repeat with new people. Start a new round by selecting a new postman and door opener. Keep playing until everyone has had a chance. Playing Kissing Cards Separate a deck of playing cards into black and red decks. After you have separated the cards into two decks, shuffle each deck separately. Distribute the playing cards. Give a card from the black deck to each of the boys and give a card form the red deck to each of the girls. Don\u2019t look at cards as you hand them out. Hand them out at random. Ask everyone to reveal their cards. Have everyone hold their cards in front of them so that everyone can see the card\u2019s number or face. Pair up the matches. Ask everyone to look for the person whose card number or face matches theirs. Matching numbers hand faces have to kiss. For example, if a boy has a black seven of spades and a girl has a red seven of hearts, those two have to kiss. Collect the cards and play again. After all of the players with matching cards have kissed, collect their cards (keeping black and red cards separate) then shuffle the cards and play again. Keep playing until everyone has gotten a couple of kisses from different people.",
