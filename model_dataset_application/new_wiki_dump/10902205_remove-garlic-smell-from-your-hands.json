If the garlic odor remains, spend another few minutes working the stainless steel in your hands. You don't have to just use a spoon, as anything made out of stainless steel will have the same effect.

          "description":"Sometimes the best way to get rid of a strong garlic smell is to simply hide it with something that smells nicer! Slice a lemon in half and squeeze the juice generously into your palms. Then use your fingers to rub the juice over your hands fully, taking care to get the juice under your nails and in between your fingers. Although lemon can give your hands a lovely scent, it's best to use this method with caution. Check your hands for any cuts or dry skin before you add the lemon, as otherwise, it can irritate your skin and sting."

Rub your hands together gently and massage the coffee into your skin, paying special attention to between your fingers and under your nails. Then enjoy the pleasant smell and your soft, exfoliated skin. If you use coffee grounds, you'll need to rinse your hands afterward."

Instead of crushing or mincing garlic using your hands and a knife, try using a garlic press instead. You can purchase garlic presses from home department stores and some grocery stores.

Choose thin latex or nitrile gloves so that you can still easily work with your hands. You can find disposable, food-grade gloves at supermarkets, department stores, or bulk food stores. Gloves are also effective for preventing smells like onion and ginger remaining on your hands too. Avoid using thick gloves, as these can make handling the garlic or using utensils very difficult."
