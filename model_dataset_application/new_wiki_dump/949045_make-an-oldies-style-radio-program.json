Back stories are useful in TV, comics, radio- anything that is serialized, because they make a good first episode, and can be referenced later on to fill out a short-ish episode."

      "headline":"Write a first episode.",
      "description":"Based on the premise and the characters, what do you imagine them doing? You could briefly tell the backstory of you main character, or write about how they met the main antagonist, etc. Remember that you are introducing the characters for the first time; a listener can't read your mind. This should be done before you choose any actors for two reasons:\nYou can get people interested in acting for you by showing them the script. You may lose the interest of your actors while they wait for something to act in."

      "headline":"Hold an audition at your house, have everyone take turns being the characters they want to be.",
