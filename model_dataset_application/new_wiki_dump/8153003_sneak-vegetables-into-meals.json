          "description":"If you're used to cooking for picky eaters that scoop the vegetables out of their food, try grating the vegetables. Grated vegetables are hard to spot and they blend in easily to most dishes. Try grating carrots, zucchini, broccoli, or beets. For example, you can mix grated carrots into meatloaf for extra flavor and moisture. You could also stir grated zucchini into pasta or casseroles."

          "headline":"Add pureed vegetables to your food.",
          "description":"Steam or roast any vegetables until they're soft. Place the cooked vegetables in a food processor or blender and blend them until they're completely smooth. You can stir these vegetable purees into sauces, mashed potatoes, soup, or pastas. For example, puree cauliflower, winter squash, or roasted red peppers and add them to your favorite casserole."

          "headline":"Add vegetables to your baked goods.",
          "description":"Many vegetables add moisture, flavor, and nutrients to baked goods. Since grated and pureed vegetables blend into the baked goods, no one will realize that they're also getting a serving of vegetables. You can usually add 1/2 cup of grated or pureed vegetables to most baked goods. You can even replace some oils in some baked goods with pureed vegetables. Try adding pumpkin puree, butternut squash puree, or grated carrots or zucchini to muffins, quick breads or pancakes."

          "headline":"Stir vegetables into ground meats.",
          "description":"You can easily grate or shred vegetables to stir into ground meats that you'll stir fry or cook into a sauce. If you can't easily grate or shred the veggie, try pureeing it before stirring it into the meat. For example, you can puree onion and stir it into meatballs. Pureed spinach (fresh or frozen) can easily be mixed into meat for meatloaf. To hide the color of the green spinach, use it with ground beef instead of ground chicken or turkey."

        {
          "headline":"Add chopped greens to your grains.",
          "description":"If you usually serve a grain or a starch with your meals, start stirring in chopped vegetables. Try to keep the vegetables small so they combine with the grain or starch. This will also keep people from noticing and picking them out. For example, you could stir chopped spinach into brown rice or quinoa."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use vegetables as sauces or dressings.",
          "description":"Mash or puree vegetables to use as sauces or dressings. Stir in vegetable stock until the purees are thin and easy to pour over foods. Roasted red peppers, butternut squash and carrots make flavorful and slightly sweet sauces. To make a quick salad dressing, simply mash avocado and thin it with olive oil and lemon juice. To use your vegetable sauces or dressings, drizzle them over:\nMashed vegetables\nMeats\nFish\nSalads"

Chop the mushrooms very fine and add them to the recipe along with the meat. For extra flavor, try sauteeing the chopped mushrooms over medium heat until they release their liquid."

You can dip crackers, tortillas, or other vegetables (like carrot or celery sticks) into the bean dip. Try seasoning the bean dip with cumin, paprika, lemon juice, chili powder, or harissa for extra flavor."

Simply replace sweet potatoes when roasting or baking potatoes or fries. They'll have a slightly sweet flavor that works well with rich meat. You may want to make mashed sweet potatoes instead of traditional mashed potatoes. They'll have more flavor and color."

You can also swap out some of the pizza sauce with a little pumpkin puree to get additional health benefits. For even more vegetables in your pizza, grate up some fresh cauliflower and blend it into the flour for your crust. No one will even realize they're eating another vegetable."

For a sweet and spicy vegetable snack, sprinkle a little chili powder or squirt a little hot sauce over the nut butter."
