Be sure to leave the circulation system off until you\u2019ve completed your task and cleaned up the dust afterward. Check your system\u2019s air filter frequently in the weeks following the sanding.

          "description":"Using box fans will help keep the room you are working in ventilated. Open the windows and place the box fans in them. Be sure to position the box fans so that air blows out of the room, not into it. Use plastic sheeting to seal off the area around the fans and window frames. Duct tape the plastic in place. If any of the windows have air conditioning units in them, remove them from the room. They get clogged with dust easily. Use the box fans on a low setting, which will cause the least air disturbance. Setting them on high will suck out a lot of the dust, but it will also increase the amount that\u2019s moving through the air."

It\u2019s not ideal, but cleaning frequently throughout the project can help you reduce a lot of dust. How often you stop to clean is up to you, but at minimum you need to clean at least once per day. Wipe down surfaces with a microfiber towel or a damp cloth. Use a vacuum cleaner to get up the dust on the floor. Do not remove your face mask during cleaning. Breathing in drywall dust can cause serious health problems.

A mat isn\u2019t going to make a huge difference, but at the very least you can reduce tracking dust by wiping the soles of your shoes off before leaving the area.

Use a dustpan to scoop up the dust pile and place it in a trash bag. Tie the bag up immediately to seal the dust in. If you are working with a significant amount of dusk, there are products you can buy that will help the dust cling to the floor. This will make it easier to sweep up. You can buy sweeping compound products at any home improvement store. They are usually sold in bags or buckets. The compound itself has a dust/sawdust-like consistency. To use, shake the compound over the floor where you want to sweep. It holds the dust down to the floor so that you can sweep it up more easily. Many of the products require 24 hours to settle over the dust before you can sweep it, so read the instructions carefully.
