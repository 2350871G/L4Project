So they have to pull their punches around Poison types- otherwise they might get stung! If another Pok\u00e9mon is too small to hit or too fast, then they won't receive much damage. This is why Fighting types are ineffective against Flying and Bug types- these types are too light, small or fast to be hit easily. In a battle of brains versus brawn, who wins? Brawn could beat up brains, sure, but in the end brains will come up with a clever strategy to win.

This is why Poison types are ineffective against other Poison types- they have to be, otherwise their own venom would injure them. Poison works by seeping into a Pokemon's body.
