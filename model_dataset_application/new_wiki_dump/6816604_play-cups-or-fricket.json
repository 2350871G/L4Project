  "text":" Setting Up Begin by setting up one end of the playing area. The overall setup will look like the sample in the image. Stand one pair of poles upright, 15 inches apart. This pair of poles is called a wicket. As a guideline, the disc can be used to measure, allow two inches of space on each side. Drive the two poles into the ground far enough to keep the poles stable, roughly eight or twelve inches. Put the cups on top. Gently place one cup upside down on top of each pole. Set up the other end similarly. Place the poles so that all four are in the shape of a rectangle roughly 40 feet (12 m) away. Determine the teams and ready for play. Divide into two teams, often two players each. Playing Determine who will take the first turn. This can be determined any number of ways, flipping a coin; Rock, Paper, Scissors; etc. The team that goes first begins with both of the flying discs. Determine which end teams will play on. One team takes one end behind one wicket, the other team takes the opposite end behind the other wicket. Begin play. The team that has been determined to go first takes the discs and begins to play offense, remaining behind their wicket. The opposing team will play defense, remaining behind their wicket. Each player on the team will take turns throwing one flying disc toward the opposite wicket. The offense attempts to hit one or both of the poles of the wicket in an attempt to knock off the cups or pass the disc through the poles themselves. They must not cross in front of their wicket while throwing. Meanwhile, the defense will stand behind their wicket and attempt to catch the cup with one hand if it gets knocked off by the offensive player. Update the score. The offense scores are as follows:\nOne point for the offense for each cup that has been knocked off and touches the ground\nOne point for the offense for each cup that has been knocked off and is not caught one handed by the defense, either using two hands or part of the body to help \"trap\" or wedge the cup.

The defense scores as follows:\nOne point for each cup is caught one handed\nNo points if the cup is caught two handed or is trapped against the body Reset the cups. Replace any cups that may have been knocked off to their original position. Prepare to switch offense and defense. The defense gathers the discs and teams switch playing offense and defense. Continue playing. Repeat steps four through seven and continue until one team has reached eleven points. End the game. Congratulate each other and shake hands, or play again!",
