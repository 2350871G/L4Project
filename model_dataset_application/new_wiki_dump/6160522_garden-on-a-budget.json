If you'd like flowers and shrubs, consider where these are to be placed in the garden, for maximum show and effect. For the sake of reducing costs, it's often best to choose plants that grow well in your area and climate. This increases the chances that the plants will survive and won't have to be replaced. Perennials, shrubs and trees are good value because they don't need to be replaced yearly. Once established, such plants can produce interesting foliage, pretty blooms and, in some cases, edibles, throughout different times of the year, not just the warmer months."
