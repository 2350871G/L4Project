Often, the plant will produce an offshoot for replacing the lower growth or can be reproduced using the following propagating procedures. The leaves look like they are sweating or crying. This is called \"guttation.\" when the plant is letting sap escape through its leaves. It's natural and means the plant is healthy. However, you'll want to protect any furniture or floors this could damage. Scars on the leaf stems are natural and come from the plant moving with the sunlight. They are not a problem.
