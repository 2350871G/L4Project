Place it on the cast iron cut side down and scrub the salt in to remove rust. Use a great deal of pressure as this will help scrape off the rust. Rub the potato in a circular motion. If you're scrubbing something like a pot or pan, do not forget the sides and bottom."

Then, place your pan on the stove over low heat. This will help get rid of any lingering moisture. It's very important to dry your pan off immediately. Water causes rust with cast iron pans, and if you leave your pan wet it will just get rusty again."

Then, take a clean paper towel and remove any excess oil. Place your pan over low heat for about 30 minutes. This should re-season the pan.
