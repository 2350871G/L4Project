On the other hand if you can't resist put back on the plate and enjoy this tasty treat! Waffle Ice Cream Sandwich Pour almost liquid ice cream into a tray.  Place in a freezer and wait to freeze.  Take out the frozen ice cream and using a knife cut waffle shaped rectangles.  Get the first waffle and place the ice-ream rectangle on to it.  Place the second waffle on top.  Churros Ice Cream Sandwich Line a baking sheet with parchment paper (or use a silicone sheet).  Place the saucepan onto the stove top. Add the milk, water, salt, sugar and butter. Warm over a medium to hot heat. Stir to combine. When the butter melts, bring to a boil. Remove from the heat once it reaches a boil. Pour in the vanilla extract and stir.

Pipe long lengths of the dough onto the parchment paper lined baking sheet. Let sit for quarter of an hour to 20 minutes. Create the churros sandwich shape. Roll each length of long dough into a little circle. The circle should be sized according to how large you'd like the ice cream sandwich to be. Realize that this will be bite-size, not huge. Make the topping for the churros. Mix the sugars and cinnamon until combined. Place this in a small bowl but ensure it is wide enough for dipping the churros into, for coating. Prepare the deep fryer. Heat to 360\u00baF (182\u00baC). These can be fried in a pot with high sides and a heavy base, using medium heat, if you don't have a deep fryer. Fry the churros. Only do two at a time, to avoid crowding the churros and to ensure the best texture. They should fr on one side for around 3 to 3.5 minutes, until golden brown.

Using the tongs, a wire skimmer or slotted spoon, remove the fried churros. Lay them down on a plate lined with kitchen paper towel, to drain the oil. Continue to make more churros, as required. Dip the churros into the cinnamon sugar mix. Do this while they are still hot. Create the ice cream sandwiches. To assemble, place one churros onto the serving plate, add the ice cream, then top with another churros. The churros should be quite warm still, as this adds to the deliciousness. Serve immediately.
