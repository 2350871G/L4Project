Keep a written list of important numbers as well in case your phone runs out of power or breaks during the storm. To make communication as quick and easy as possible, adjust your phone's speed dial settings so each number connects to an important contact. If possible, laminate your written list so it doesn't get destroyed by rain or floodwater."

Instead, establish an emergency contact beforehand that lives outside of the affected area. This ensures that everyone has a secure person to report to and get updates from. To make sure everyone has updated information, check in with your central contact regularly. If you don't know anybody outside the danger zone, set up a group chat via text message, instant messenger, or social media so you can contact lots of people at once."

Store this burner phone in a secure, waterproof container, and make sure to include a charger, SIM card, and anything else the device requires to operate. Look for inexpensive emergency phones at used electronics stores. By law, all cell phones must be able to make 911 calls whether you pay for a wireless subscription or not. Consider buying a prepaid or pay as you go SIM card so you can call family and friends during emergencies without paying a monthly service bill."

Even if your area offers a text-based 911 service, do not rely on it during the storm."

However, redialing immediately after a failed call will create a greater burden on the network, lowering your chances of getting through. To avoid this, wait at least 10 seconds between each call attempt."
