You can select organic and fair trade chocolates, and talk to your guests about how chocolate is made and how the cacao industry works. For a fun twist, throw in some chocolates that are made with sheep's milk or goat's milk. There are also chocolates made with chilies, figs, bread, and curry (although not all in one bar!). You can also expose your guests to chocolates with a much lower sugar content than they're used to. At first, it'll seem bitter, but challenge them to notice flavors that would otherwise be overshadowed by sweetness. Another potential theme is choosing chocolates that are made in your region, if there are enough. Look in the closest city with a chocolate shop or chocolatier."
