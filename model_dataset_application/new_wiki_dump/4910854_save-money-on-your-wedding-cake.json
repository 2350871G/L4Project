After all, there could be an equally good or even better bakery just around the corner for a cheaper price. Remember, more expensive doesn't necessarily mean better. Don't be afraid to try somewhere new that you don't know. Newer bakeries usually have good offers as they are trying to attract more customers. Look online to find local or close enough places with good deals. You may be surprised at what you might find."

          "description":"Instead of going to a bakery, purchase your wedding cake from someone who bakes cake as a hobby. They are equally talented and will charge less than a fancier bakery. You can also use a baker who does not necessarily specialize in wedding cakes. Visit your local bakery and ask if the baker makes wedding cakes. Keep in mind that you may have fewer design options when using an amateur baker or a baker that does not typically make wedding cakes. You can also ask your caterer if a cake can be included in your package. The cost may be lower than ordering your cake through a separate bakery."

If you are baking the cake yourself, look for recipes that freeze well so you can bake the cake ahead of time. If a friend or family member is baking the cake, ask them to make your cake at a discount or even better, it could be their wedding gift to you. It is a risk using an inexperienced baker. You should do a trial run before the wedding. The test cake should be the exactly like your real wedding cake. If you go the do-it-yourself route, have a backup plan just in case."

          "description":"Flowers, piping, tall-tiers, and intricate designs will increase the price of your cake. The more add-ons, the more expensive your cake will be. Consider a cake with a simple, clean design. Flat designs and painted flower motifs are less expensive options. If you have a design that you like, show a picture to your baker and ask what some more cost-effective alternatives are. For example, Small frosting dots and solid color tiers are alternatives to intricate lace designs. Square cakes are less expensive and will feed more guests. Uniquely shaped cakes are more expensive as well. The baker often has to cut away layers of the cake to create the shape."

          "headline":"Decorate your cake with real flowers.",
          "description":"Sugar flowers take a lot of time and work, and your baker is charging you for the amount of time and effort it takes to design the cake. Use fresh, in-season flowers to decorate the cake instead. They are beautiful and will save you money. Let your baker know that you plan to use fresh flowers. The flesh flowers should be pesticide free and food safe. If you prefer sugar flowers, talk to your baker about flowers that are not as detailed. For example, hydrangeas and calla lilies are less intricate than roses and peonies. Flowers made using butter cream instead of gum paste are less expensive."

          "headline":"Use a display cake.",
          "description":"Ask your baker to make a one or two-tier cake for you to cut and bake a sheet cake to serve to your guests. You could save about 20% per slice if you use this method. The cake table will be a little empty because your cake is small, but think of this as an opportunity to decorate your table. The table can be decorated with flowers, candles, or a beautiful table cloth. You can also get a decorated base board from your baker."

You could also decorate your cake with lace or satin ribbon or create your own wedding cake topper. Practice your decorating skills on another cake before you decorate your actual wedding cake. Make sure the flowers you buy are pesticide free and food safe. Check the flowers for small bugs before you place them on your cake."

It takes more steps and materials to make fondant, and it is more difficult to work with compared to buttercream icing. Some bakers even charge extra for working with fondant. Butter cream is not always less expensive. If you want butter cream with a smooth applique finish, it may cost as much as the fondant. People often prefer the taste of butter cream icing to fondant as well. You can save money and make your guests happy."

If you go the no frosting route, you can try different flavors and fillings. Naked cakes can be decorated with fresh flowers, fruit wedges, or a unique cake topper. You have many options for fillings such as fruit fillings, lemon curd, or chocolate ganache."

        {
          "headline":"Choose simple flavors.",
          "description":"Specialty cake and frosting flavors and seasonal flavors are more expensive than simple flavors. Simple flavors include vanilla, chocolate, and lemon. Specialty flavors include flavors such as red velvet, carrot cake, or seasonal flavors. If you want to use specialty flavors, use them only for the smaller tiers. For example, you could use vanilla for your largest tier and red velvet for a small tier. Also limit your cake to two flavors and two fillings. Your baker will likely charge you more for three or more."

        {
          "headline":"Get a fake cake.",
          "description":"Have your baker create a fully decorated cake using Styrofoam tiers. You can then serve your guests a sheet cake with with the same color frosting. If you want to have a cake cutting during your reception, make sure the bottom tier is edible. A fake cake is particularly handy if you have a cake that needs to be refrigerated (e.g. ice cream cake or whipped cream), a small guest list but want a large cake, or a huge amount of guests but only want to display a smaller cake (i.e. two-tier). If you want a naked cake, you cannot use Styrofoam tiers as a substitute. Keep in mind that you are still paying your baker for a fake cake and a sheet cake. An elaborate fake cake can become very expensive. Talk with your baker about the most cost-effective option."

You can have multiple flavors and different decorations on the cupcakes. You can also opt for a small cake for you and your bride or groom and cupcakes for all the wedding guests. You can arrange your cupcakes in the shape of a wedding cake as well."

Pies, brownies, ice cream sundae bar, doughnuts or any other dessert that you like can be included on the table. Again, you can have a small cake for the bride and groom and the dessert table for your guests. The options are limitless with a dessert table. You can mix and match your favorite desserts too."
