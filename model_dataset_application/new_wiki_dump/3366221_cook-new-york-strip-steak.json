          "description":"The secret to getting a great pan-seared steak is having a hot pan and by only cooking as long as is necessary. The best strip steaks have a crisp, seared exterior that can only be achieved with a piping hot pan, so your first step is to set your pan on your stove and turn the burner to high heat. While you're waiting for your pan to heat up, you can remove your steaks from their packaging and start seasoning them. Here's an easy test to see if your pan is hot enough \u2014 wet your fingers in the sink and flick the water onto the pan. If the droplets immediately sizzle and evaporate or \"dance\" across the surface of the pan, it's ready!"

          "headline":"Season and oil your steaks.",
          "description":"As your pan starts to warm, set your steaks on a clean cutting board or platter. Season each side with salt and pepper. The precise amount you use is up to you \u2014 some guides, for instance, recommend using a mixture of about 1/4 teaspoons pepper and 1 & 1/2 teaspoons salt for every two steaks. A good rule is to err on the side of using too little salt (after all, you can always add more when the steak is done). At this point, you can also add any additional dry seasonings you want. Pre-packaged mixes like Johnny's, etc. are a good choice, as are your own concoctions (for instance, rosemary, thyme, and minced garlic is one common combination). After seasoning your steaks, coat each with oil. This is important for getting a crispy sear \u2014 the oil essentially \"fries\" the outer layer of the steak."

They should immediately begin to sizzle and crackle \u2014 this is a good thing! Move the steaks an inch or so from their original location a few seconds after you add them to the pan to prevent them from sticking, then simply let them cook. Some cooking guides recommend letting your steaks warm to room temperature before adding them to a hot pan under the assumption that this helps them cook more evenly. Although letting your steaks warm for 20 to 30 minutes almost certainly won't hurt them, there is some evidence to suggest this claim is just a myth."

          "headline":"Flip after about three or four minutes.",
          "description":"The trick to getting an excellent steak from your pan is to only cook each side as long as necessary \u2014 cooking too long can make the meat tough. Let your steaks cook in the pan until they develop a dark brown crust on their bottom side flecked with black, charred portions. Depending on the heat of your pan, this usually takes about three to four minutes, though longer or shorter is possible, so keep an eye on your steaks. For a well-done steak, you may want to cook a little longer \u2014 up to or beyond five minutes. Conversely, for a rare steak, you'll want to flip the steaks a little earlier \u2014 as early as two to two and a half minutes. The debate about whether to only flip a steak once or whether to flip numerous times is an old one. Conventional wisdom dictates that steaks should only be flipped once to give them the best possible crust. However, many modern steak aficionados disagree, instead recommending frequent flipping."

Wait until your steaks have developed a dark crust on the bottom similar to the one on top, then check for signs of done-ness. If your steaks aren't quite done, consider finishing them off in the oven or giving them a few extra minutes in the pan. Below are common signs of a done steak:\nA firm texture at the edges that becomes softer towards the center of the meat\nNo red remaining in the center (pinkish to light brown is OK)\nAn internal temperature of about 120 to 150 F (49 to 65 C)."

          "description":"Like many other cuts of meat, New York strip steaks can be given extra flavor by soaking them in a marinade before cooking. We've provided a recipe to one simple but delicious marinade above, but literally hundreds of others will also work well. There aren't any hard and fast rules for making your own marinade, but there are a few basic guidelines that most marinades follow. If you're a novice, try including the following ingredients in your marinade to start with:\nA source of fat. Usually, this is an oil, like vegetable oil, canola oil, olive oil, sesame oil, etc. An acid. This can be a citrus juice (like lemon, lime, or orange), wine, vinegar (balsamic, red wine, apple cider, etc.) or another acidic liquid. Other seasonings. You can get creative here \u2014 anything from Worcestershire sauce to dijon mustard to peanut butter to parsley to garlic to soy sauce can work, depending on whether it pairs well with the other ingredients.

Let them sit in your fridge for at least two hours so that they're able to soak up the flavor of the marinade \u2014 some chefs let their meat marinade overnight or even several days to give it an extra dose of flavor."

          "headline":"Heat your grill.",
          "description":"As with pan-searing, good grilled steaks require a high-temperature initial searing to develop their delicious crust. For this reason, you'll want to start your grill or barbecue well before you plan to cook. Keep the lid close to speed up the grill's heating process. For gas grills, pre-heating is easy \u2014 simply set one or more burners to \"high\" and shut the lid for 5 minutes or so. For charcoal grills, first, you'll need to light your charcoal, wait for it to flame up, and finally ash over before cooking can begin. This process can take upwards of half an hour, so leave yourself plenty of time. Once your charcoals are ready for cooking, spread them out evenly with a grill tool to prepare the entire grill for cooking."

Allow them to cook much as you would during a pan searing, flipping them after three to five minutes once a suitable crust has formed. Once you're familiar with a gas grill, you can usually expect to get consistent results from it. The same can't necessarily be said for charcoal grills, whose cooking times can vary based on how much charcoal is used and what temperature the charcoal is burning at. Thus, you'll want to keep an extra-close eye on your steaks when cooking over charcoal \u2014 turn them as soon as you're satisfied with the dark brown crust on the bottom edge."

Check for the same signs of done-ness as described above (firm texture at edges, soft in middle, no red inside the meat, etc.) and, if satisfied, remove them from the grill and serve! Optionally, you may want to consider painting the steaks with leftover marinade during the cooking process to help them develop a delicious exterior. However, you won't want to apply any marinade once the steaks are finished cooking \u2014 since the marinade has come in contact with the raw steaks, this can transfer harmful bacteria to them."

To start, fill a dutch oven about two-thirds of the way full with water and set it to a medium heat. You want the internal temperature of your dutch oven to reach about 130 F (54 C) before you begin to cook your steaks. If your dutch oven doesn't have a built-in thermometer, you can use a candy thermometer by attaching it to the side of the oven."

However, there's a way around this \u2014 by giving the steaks a quick pan-crisping before (and, as we'll see, after) they're cooked in the dutch oven, we can still give them their desirable crust. Season and prepare your steaks and pan exactly as directed for a pan-searing above.

Remove the air from the bag either with a vacuum-packing tool or by lowering the bag into the water with the seal open, then sealing once the water has forced most of the air out. At this point, drop the bag of steaks into the dutch oven and close it. If necessary, raise the heat setting of the oven slightly to bring it back up to 130. Cook at this temperature for about two to two and a half hours. As the steaks cook, periodically check their progress.

One thing you may want to consider doing is making a simple sauce or garnish to put on your steaks once they're finished. For instance, you can make a delicious mushroom garnish by melting a few tablespoons of butter in a saucepan, then tossing in some mushrooms, chopped shallots, and minced garlic for flavor \u2014 simply cook the ingredients together until they're flavorful and fragrant. You can \"eyeball\" these ingredients if you'd like \u2014 it's hard to add \"too much\" of any one of them. For precise measurement recommendations, see the ingredients section above.
