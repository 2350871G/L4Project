          "description":"Look at the end of your wrench\u2019s handle to find the tightener that locks the settings in place. It is usually a plastic or metal cap that is stuck into the end of your wrench. Often, it is a different color than the rest of your wrench as well. Twist it counterclockwise by hand to loosen the piece so that you can change the wrench\u2019s settings. You don\u2019t need to take it off of your wrench, just loosen it until you don\u2019t feel a ton of resistance."

          "headline":"Find and identify the torque measurements on your wrench.",
          "description":"Inspect the area near your handle to find the hash marks for the torque setting. There will be 1 set of larger numbers on the body of the wrench and 1 set of smaller numbers on the handle. The smaller numbers are the smaller digits, while the larger numbers are the larger units. Torque is measured in foot-pounds or meter-kilograms (ft-lb or m-kg). Your torque wrench will list 2 sets of numbers on the wrench\u2019s hash marks. The lower number is the measurement in foot-pounds. The larger number is the measurement in meter-kilograms. The vertical location of the edge of the handle determines the baseline while the rotation of the handle determines the smaller digits. There is a center line on the wrench to show where the handle is set. For example, if the edge of the handle is on the hash mark for 100, and the smaller number on the handle itself is turned to 5, the torque setting for the wrench is 105 ft-lb (1397 m-kg)."

          "headline":"Turn the dial to raise or lower the torque setting on the wrench.",
          "description":"With the tightener loosened, brace the body of the wrench with your nondominant hand. Turn the handle clockwise to raise it, or counterclockwise to lower it. Once you reach the desired hash mark, stop turning the handle.Tip: Refer to your car or bike\u2019s manual to determine how much torque a nut or bolt requires to be safely set. There are no universal rules for torque settings on vehicles. If you need to reach a specific number, raise the handle to the hash mark that is within 5 ft-lb (200 m-kg) of your number. So if you know you need to reach 140 ft-lb (1860 m-kg), raise the handle to the hash mark between 135-145 ft-lb (1795-1928 m-kg). Some torque wrench handles are slide up and down instead of twisting into place."

        {
          "headline":"Twist the dial on the handle to make minor adjustments.",
          "description":"Once you\u2019re close to the desired number, turn your attention from the height of the handle to the dial itself. Follow the readings as you turn the handle slowly. As you turn clockwise, the number goes up. As you turn counterclockwise, the number goes down. There are a few negative numbers after 0 so that you can move down a little as well. On some wrenches, the dial moves independently of the handle and you can twist it by turning the dial, not the handle."

          "headline":"Add the smaller digit on the handle to the number on the larger hash mark to determine total torque.",
          "description":"Once you\u2019ve adjusted the handle\u2019s height and twisted the dial, calculate your total torque to ensure that it\u2019s accurately adjusted by adding the numbers together. Take the hash mark on your handle and add the number marked on the dial to get your torque. So if the dial reads 4, and the handle reads 50, your total torque is 54 ft-lb (718 m-kg). You add the negative numbers as well. For example, if your hash mark is 120 and the dial is -2, you add 120 to -2 to get 118 ft-lb (1569 m-kg)."

Twist the tightener clockwise by hand until it won\u2019t move any more. This will lock the handle in place. Once you lock the tightener, you cannot adjust your torque setting."

If you have an extender or adaptor that you\u2019re using, you can slide that into the opening at the head instead. Torque wrenches come in different sizes, but the sockets are almost always interchangeable. Torque wrenches are expensive, so they rarely come in a single size."

Turn the vehicle\u2019s nut or bolt clockwise with your fingers until the threading catches the threading on the screw. Turn the nut or bolt until it won\u2019t turn by hand anymore.Warning: You should not use a torque wrench to make the threads initially catch.

Almost all torque wrenches have automatic return functions so you don\u2019t need to reposition them on the nut or bolt. For this type of wrench, simply move it counterclockwise to reset it. If you have a manual wrench, reposition it on the nut or bolt to continue torquing it down. If you hear a clicking or switching noise when you return the handle counterclockwise, you have an automatically-returning torque wrench."

          "description":"If your automatic wrench clicks when you\u2019re returning it, keep tightening the nut or bolt. If it starts clicking when you turn it clockwise though, stop tightening the nut or bolt. The clicking noise while tightening indicates that you have reached your desired torque level. On a manual wrench, stop turning it when you feel the wrench resisting. So if you have the handle adjusted to 100 ft-lb (1330 m-kg) of torque, the bolt is tightened to that level the moment it starts clicking when you try to tighten it. Manual wrenches will simply stop moving after the nut or bolt has been turned to the intended level of torque."

Manual wrenches will simply stop moving after the nut or bolt has been turned to the intended level of torque. Maintaining Your Wrench Dial the wrench back to zero when you\u2019re done using it. When you\u2019re done using the wrench, turn both dial settings on the handle back to 0. Leaving the dial turned to a torque setting higher than 0 can throw the calibration off over time.
