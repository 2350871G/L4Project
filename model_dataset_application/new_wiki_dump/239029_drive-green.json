      "description":"Don't just sit there with the engine running; you're choking the planet! Idling a car for only 20 seconds burns more gas and emits more CO2 than simply turning it off and starting it up again when you are actually ready to drive! If you are stuck at a light, a RR crossing or in that lovely traffic, shift to neutral \u2013 over the course of a year you would be amazed at how much less CO2 will be emitted on your watch!"

      "headline":"Don't be a lead foot.",
      "description":"When you are hitting the gas and on the move, ease up lead foot! When you are at a light don't gun your engine. You may think you're looking cool but really you're just wasting gas and poisoning the air. Save your drag racing fantasies for another day! Don't jack rabbit start or jump off the line when you get the green. Head out nice and easy and reduce your gas consumption. Your RPM's are a good indication of how smart you are driving. Red-lining your car is anything but \u201cgreen\u201d for the environment."

      "description":"Maybe it's time to buy a green car. These days, more and more car makers sell hybrid vehicles, using gas and electricity - and now they even make ones that run on ethanol and natural gas! These cars could save you up to USD$300 every year! However, give it some thought -- junking a vehicle produces an incredible amount of waste and making new cars takes a lot of materials and energy. You should weigh these factors against the benefits of upgrading to a more efficient vehicle."
