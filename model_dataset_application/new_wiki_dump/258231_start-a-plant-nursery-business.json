Come up with a name and hire a graphic designer to create a logo. You can also create your own logo in Photoshop or Illustrator if you have a little design experience. Order some business cards with your name and company logo. Print a few mission statements with the logo and include your mission statement. These will be incredibly helpful when you\u2019re starting out as you try to network and appeal to customers. Most nurseries work with a few different varieties of plants. If you\u2019re absolutely certain that you want to focus on a specific species or style of plant, emphasize it in your statement and logo.

Choose 2-3 species of plants that you\u2019re passionate about to start off with. Pick plants that you have experience growing and you think will be popular based on your local market. Buy your seeds and plant them. Check in everyday to provide each plant the necessary water, sun, and care as you\u2019re growing. Succulents are an excellent focus if you\u2019re in an area with a lot of younger people or college students. They\u2019re easy to take care of and they\u2019re relatively cheap, so they\u2019re a good choice for a younger market. Flowers, like roses and orchids, are always a safe bet. Just check to make sure that there aren\u2019t already a bunch of flower shops in your area. Track your growing cycles so that it\u2019s easy to figure out when your plants are going to be ready. This will make it easier to figure out when you need to host some sales."

Visit local flower and plant shops and look at their prices. If you can undercut them while still turning a profit on your growing costs, do it to create a big splash as you enter the market. If the demand is high in your area, consider raising your prices to test the waters and see what you can make. Host your sales as often as you have enough inventory to sell. For some nursery owners, this is once a month. For other owners, this may be once a week. It all depends on how often you have plants for sale. Succulents usually cost somewhere between $10-20. Flower prices can vary wildly from species to species. Usually they fetch $5-20. Snake plants, spider plants, money trees, and jades range from $10-100 based on their size. The bigger the plant, the more expensive it usually is."

Be visible and walk around your yard so that customers can easily find you. Introduce yourself to people and explain how to care for your plants. A lot of nurseries save some time and energy by giving each species of plant the same price. For example, if you\u2019re selling a smaller succulent and a larger succulent, it may be easier to simply list all small succulents as $5 and all larger succulents as $8. Keep some change on you.

For example, if you\u2019ve grown a few flowering and leafy plants, purchase some succulents so that you have something to offer everyone. Retail shops usually sell pots, soil, and gardening tools as well, so purchase some of those from wholesalers in case your customers need them. Retail shops rarely specialize in certain types of plants unless they\u2019re in major cities, and there\u2019s a lot of competition. A majority of retail nurseries grow most of their plants. Some of them grow all of them, but it can be hard to grow the variety of plants necessary to appeal to everyone. A lot of nurseries make up for this by buying the plants they\u2019re missing and marking the prices up. You can purchase from backyard nurseries and then mark the price up to make a profit."

Arrange your store in a way that makes it easy to navigate. Place larger plants at the front of the store to make the entryway feel impressive. Store the general gardening tools and materials at the back of the store and put your plants up front. This way, when people walk past your store, they\u2019ll see the plants first, which are more likely to drive customers inside. Buy reclaimed and upcycled furniture if you can. Some plant-buying customers care deeply about sustainability, and it\u2019s good to be environmentally-conscious.

Adjust your prices and inventory based on your sales. If business is slowing down after the opening rush, start doing some local marketing. Post ads in the local paper, and put out signs on the sidewalk in front of your store. Retail nurseries in temperate climates often shut down in the winter.

Wholesale contracts are typically worth a lot of money, so protect yourself by having a buyer sign it after they\u2019ve agreed to buy from you. If you can, sign some contracts to sell to a store or vendor before you begin planting. This will take a lot of the pressure off early and will lock in the type of plant that you\u2019re growing."

          "description":"Depending on what you\u2019re growing, the first round of plants may take anywhere from 1 week to 6 months to grow. Schedule 2-3 different nursery sites to grow in intervals in a way where you\u2019ll be able to ship your plants right before your customers need a new shipment.Tip: Always overplant. You\u2019re going to lose some of your plants, whether it\u2019s due to the weather, predators, or insects. Have a few extra plants available to compensate. Some seeds may simply fail to sprout regardless of how much care you take to treat your plants right. The type of soil that you use is dependent upon the plant, flower, or tree that you\u2019re growing. Monitor the soil closely by getting it tested regularly by an environmental engineer. Consider hiring aerial seeding contractors once every 6 month to coat your field with growing nutrients and seed preservatives. For example, if you\u2019re growing snake plants and a store expects a shipment of 20 plants once every month, plant 3 different sites of 30-35 seeds in intervals where you\u2019ll have a new set of mature plants once every 30 days or so. Depending on what you\u2019re growing, you\u2019ll probably need a massive water supply. Contact your local utility company to see what the rules are regarding large water usage in your area. Cover crops and plants with awnings during dry spells if your plants are getting too much sun."

As you expand, consider hiring workers or drivers based on your specific needs."

Hand out your business card and do your best to develop as many relationships as possible. This is an easy way to ensure that you\u2019re marketing your services to the highest number of customers possible. Wholesale nurseries rarely sell plants directly to the public, but you can certainly take your excess inventory to a street fair, farmer\u2019s market, or garden show to sell it off."

A lot of nurseries make up for this by buying the plants they\u2019re missing and marking the prices up. You can purchase from backyard nurseries and then mark the price up to make a profit. Set your store up and arrange your plants. Put together any furniture that you\u2019ve purchased for the store. Clean out the closets and show floor, and set your plants up. Arrange your store in a way that makes it easy to navigate. Place larger plants at the front of the store to make the entryway feel impressive. Store the general gardening tools and materials at the back of the store and put your plants up front. This way, when people walk past your store, they\u2019ll see the plants first, which are more likely to drive customers inside. Buy reclaimed and upcycled furniture if you can. Some plant-buying customers care deeply about sustainability, and it\u2019s good to be environmentally-conscious. Many nurseries grow in a different location and bring the plants they want to sell to the store every week or so. Hire employees as needed to operate your store. Consider trying to rely on the help of family members and friends to save money as you\u2019re setting up. Once you open, you\u2019ll have an idea of what your cash flow is like. Once you know what you can afford and what your needs are, you can hire a manager, cashier, or clerk. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to run a nursery on your own\u2014especially if you\u2019ve got a smaller space that can only accommodate 5-15 customers at a time. Adjust prices and shift your focus to react to the market. If succulents are selling quickly, shift your growing patterns to accommodate more succulents. If you can\u2019t sell any snake plants, stop growing them. Adjust your prices and inventory based on your sales. If business is slowing down after the opening rush, start doing some local marketing. Post ads in the local paper, and put out signs on the sidewalk in front of your store. Retail nurseries in temperate climates often shut down in the winter. Some owners sublease their space to rent it out in the off-months as a concert hall or reception space. Starting a Wholesale Nursery Contact local flower shops, stores, and vendors to see what their needs are. Reach out to the businesses in your area and explain that you\u2019re starting a nursery. If you know that you\u2019re going to focus on a specific species or style of plant, inquire to see if they\u2019d be interested in doing some business. If you aren\u2019t sure what you\u2019re going to grow, ask what these stores and vendors have trouble getting their hands on. Sign contracts with local businesses to begin growing plants for them. Create a contract by writing it yourself or hiring a lawyer to write a template for you. Include your pricing for each individual sale, your responsibilities, and any delivery instructions. Wholesale contracts are typically worth a lot of money, so protect yourself by having a buyer sign it after they\u2019ve agreed to buy from you. If you can, sign some contracts to sell to a store or vendor before you begin planting. This will take a lot of the pressure off early and will lock in the type of plant that you\u2019re growing. Set up a nursery site and start a growing schedule your plants. Depending on what you\u2019re growing, the first round of plants may take anywhere from 1 week to 6 months to grow. Schedule 2-3 different nursery sites to grow in intervals in a way where you\u2019ll be able to ship your plants right before your customers need a new shipment.Tip: Always overplant. You\u2019re going to lose some of your plants, whether it\u2019s due to the weather, predators, or insects. Have a few extra plants available to compensate. Some seeds may simply fail to sprout regardless of how much care you take to treat your plants right. The type of soil that you use is dependent upon the plant, flower, or tree that you\u2019re growing. Monitor the soil closely by getting it tested regularly by an environmental engineer. Consider hiring aerial seeding contractors once every 6 month to coat your field with growing nutrients and seed preservatives. For example, if you\u2019re growing snake plants and a store expects a shipment of 20 plants once every month, plant 3 different sites of 30-35 seeds in intervals where you\u2019ll have a new set of mature plants once every 30 days or so. Depending on what you\u2019re growing, you\u2019ll probably need a massive water supply. Contact your local utility company to see what the rules are regarding large water usage in your area. Cover crops and plants with awnings during dry spells if your plants are getting too much sun. Fulfill your growing obligations and deliver your plants on time. Grow your plants and continue to meet your contractual obligations in order to keep growing your business. Wholesale nurseries almost always deliver their goods, so buy a truck once you have the capital to make bigger deliveries. As you expand, consider hiring workers or drivers based on your specific needs. Attend local garden and plant shows to network with other growers and market your plants. Whenever there\u2019s a plant show or convention in your area, attend it to meet other growers and potential buyers. Hand out your business card and do your best to develop as many relationships as possible. This is an easy way to ensure that you\u2019re marketing your services to the highest number of customers possible. Wholesale nurseries rarely sell plants directly to the public, but you can certainly take your excess inventory to a street fair, farmer\u2019s market, or garden show to sell it off.",
