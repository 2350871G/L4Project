These applications work similarly to the cheating websites, but are more convenient so that you can access them directly from your phone in the middle of a game. Some apps allow you to take screenshots of your board so that you don't have to manually enter the tiles in yourself. Others can be programmed to automatically play words for you without you having to do anything. Examples of such apps include: Free Cheats With Words, Words with free EZ Cheat, and Cheat Master 5000. Be very cautious when downloading new programs. If you're going through your operating system's \"app store,\" check the reviews in case the program has unwanted features. When downloading directly from a website, make sure that it is reputable and that your anti-virus software is up-to-date.
