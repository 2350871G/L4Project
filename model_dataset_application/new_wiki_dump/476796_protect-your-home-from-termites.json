Unlike ants however, termites shed their wings after swarming. Termites will leave worm-like mud tunnels that are visible on the surface of walls within your house. These tunnels are used to protect worker termites. To determine if it\u2019s an ant or a termite, look at its antennae. If they are bent, this is a sign you have flying ants. If they are straight then they are termites. Note that subterranean termites don\u2019t leave droppings behind, as they use them to construct tunnels."

Look for sawdust-like material around any holes or cracks around your home. The sawdust-like matter is known as frass, which is a form of termite excrement.
