          "description":"If you like all of your books arranged together, line them up on 1 or 2 shelves with their spines facing outward. Or, if you prefer to separate your books by topic, genre, or cover color, organize several different book groupings on 5 or 6 shelves. If you have any books with attractive covers that you\u2019d like to display, turn the book sideways and display it with its cover facing outward. Or, stack 4 or 5 books horizontally to create a raised section on a bookshelf. You can then decorate the shelf by placing an object\u2014e.g., a candle or vase\u2014on top of the horizontal books."

Many sets of bookends are designed to look like stand-alone decorations on shelving. If this appeals to you, you could set up multiple pairs of bookends on 3 or 4 different shelves. You can purchase bookends at any major retail store. If you\u2019re looking for more crafted or homemade bookends, purchase a pair through online DIY retailers like Etsy."

As with the books, it\u2019s common to display all of your DVDs and other media on one shelf. Set them on the shelf nearest your DVD or Blu-ray player for easy access. Add a decorative touch to the DVDs by holding them in place with a decorative bookend. Organize television shows and movies by medium, genre, or alphabetically."

Rather than putting all collections on the same shelf, spread them out among a few different shelves. Try different arrangements to catch the eye of visitors. Collections that you can arrange on the shelves include:\nA nicely bound book series. A movie trilogy or series. A television series on DVD or Blu-ray."

As with books, if you have any games with artistic covers, display them with the cover facing outward. If you already have your gaming console on a shelf, it would be most efficient to arrange your selection of games on the same shelf."
