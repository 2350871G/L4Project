Mediterranean foods are also great for romantic picnics. Avoid messy things like pizza or chicken wings. Think of foods that are simple to eat and won\u2019t leave a residue on your hands, or stains on your shirt. Ask your date if they are a vegan or vegetarian and make sure to see if they have any food allergies."

          "headline":"Prepare snacks to eat while you talk.",
          "description":"Bring things you can snack on while you talk to your date. Think of snacks that don\u2019t require the use of any utensils like nuts, chocolate, a cheese plate, or olives. Instead of cheap snacks like potato chips, use apple chips as an alternative. Fruit like strawberries, blueberries, or cut up melon is a great snack. Hummus and pita bread are a romantic snack both of you can share. Just avoid the garlic variation. If you\u2019re going to bring candy, try to keep it mature. Things like sugar-coated nuts or high-quality chocolate are better than the cheap stuff you\u2019d find at a gas station."

          "headline":"Pack some bubbly.",
          "description":"You can pack champagne, non-alcoholic champagne, or even seltzer water in flutes for a picnic. If you\u2019re younger or need to drive, you should pick the non-alcoholic alternatives. Champagne has long been known as one of the most romantic alcoholic beverages in our culture. If you\u2019re on a tight budget, you can get sparkling wine as an alternative. Remember to bring a corkscrew so you can open the bottle! You can keep your drinks chilled with a cooler filled with ice."

          "description":"If you don't bake you can pick up fresh cookies or specialty sweets like cannolis or chocolate croissants at a local bakery. However, if you\u2019re on a limited budget or like to bake, making desserts at home is a cheaper alternative. Chocolate has properties which promote good feelings and have positive health results. If you don\u2019t feel confident with your baking skills, go with the instant bake items that are found in boxes."

If you really want to be authentic, you can visit antique shops for one. If you can\u2019t find a basket in time, try using a nice looking cloth or tote bag. Avoid packing your stuff in a backpack or box because it will take away from the romance."

While crystal flutes are the most formal, glass or even plastic ones are more appropriate for a special picnic. If you do use breakable glasses, keep them wrapped in cloth or a towel during transportation. Stemmed or stemless wine glasses could be nice alternatives to champagne flutes."

Some blankets have a waterproof side which make them perfect for wet grass. If it has recently rained you can bring a shower curtain lining to put under your blanket to prevent you from getting wet. Down comforters are filled with the undercoating of goose and duck, and are softer than synthetic blankets."

In addition, your date might not find it attractive that you litter if they\u2019re an environmentalist. Littering fines are different in different states, but can be anywhere from $1,000 in fines or community service."

Do they like the warm weather and being in the sun or are they the type of person who prefers shade? Take all of these things into consideration before picking your location.

If the beach isn\u2019t their thing, then finding a garden, or just a wide-open space outside is a good location for your romantic picnic. A secluded area is the best for a romantic picnic. Make sure to cover your food when on the beach or else sand will get in your food. Some places restrict the consumption of alcohol."

Factor in how long it\u2019ll take you to eat and how much conversation you will have. Time flies when you\u2019re having fun, so make sure to keep an eye on it. You\u2019ll also need to make sure that the picnic coordinates with the other person\u2019s schedule. Leave enough time for any unexpected delays."
