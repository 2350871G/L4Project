You can use two pieces of scrap wood set about 3 feet (0.91 m) apart from each other as a stand. Make sure the area you are working in is free from debris and that the ground is generally even. This will make your work much safer and also easier."

Using a chainsaw can be dangerous, so it is important to wear the proper safety gear. You\u2019ll need to protect your eyes, ears, and skin from any harm, so covering up as much as you can is important. You may also want to wear a breathing mask since railroad ties often contain chemicals and dust. Wearing chainsaw chaps is recommended for additional protection. You can purchase safety gear at most hardware stores."

          "description":"You can stand in a squat position over the railroad tie to get leverage and slowly move the chainsaw downward. You\u2019ll want to stop cutting before you reach the bottom of the tie so that your blade does not get stuck in between the two halves. This will also prevent you from cutting through the tie and into the ground, damaging your chainsaw. Railroad ties are tough and hard to cut, so they may require you to change your blade out or sharpen it during the process. Cutting the tie could take a couple of minutes, so take care to work slowly and carefully. You can have a friend help you out by holding the railroad tie steady as you cut, but it is not necessary. If you do have someone help you out, make sure that they are also wearing safety gear and do not get in range of the chain saw blade."

Try to make sure your cuts line up perfectly, so that your chainsaw goes through smoothly. Use caution as you finish up your cut, and work slowly so that you are in control of your chainsaw the entire time you are cutting."
