If it tends to clump together rather than crumble, it\u2019s probably got clay in it. If your soil has high amounts of clay, you\u2019ll find that it gets really hard when it dries out, and may even form cracks on the surface.

          "description":"You should prepare the ground at least one season ahead of planting, ideally in the spring or summer. When you come to plant the hedge in winter, the ground will be much harder to work than it is in the warmer, drier months. Use a spade to turn the soil over to help improve drainage. You can also add a soil improver, such as well-rotted horse manure or spent mushroom compost. Fresh horse manure can \u2018burn\u2019 young saplings so don\u2019t use it immediately before planting. Part of the reason for preparing your site this early is so the manure can rot down in the soil, becoming helpful for the plant rather than harmful. You can also purchase prepared soil improvers from your local garden supply store."

If you start preparing the ground a year before you plan to plant your hedge, you can also use special weed control fabric or big sheets of cardboard. Place these sheets over the area where you will plan to have your hedge. Weigh them down with rocks and other heavy objects.

Both work equally well but bare-root plants will need planting quickly after delivery. Plants supplied in pots are more forgiving if you make them wait a while.

Young vulnerable pot plants may prefer a sheltered spot to avoid wind damage.

To achieve a good density of hedge, plant your saplings in a staggered double row. If your saplings are bare-root, it\u2019s best to plant at a density of between 3 to 7 plants per meter. For a hedge that becomes dense even more quickly, plant a staggered double row of between 5 to 7 plants per meter. Although plants do need space, there will inevitably be some failures leading to gaps, so it\u2019s usually best to plant at fairly high density if you have an adequate number of saplings to do so."

If you\u2019re planting in a single line, aim for 4 plants per meter. If planting in a staggered double row as is advised, aim for 6 plants per meter."

Autumn is the best time because you will be able to avoid disturbing nesting birds because your hedge plants will be dormant and will lack leaves. Don\u2019t be afraid to cut the hedge back fairly hard as this will help it grow thick and dense. For the first two years, prune the beech plants by using plant clippers to cut back the longer shoots and cutting off the tips of shorter ones. This will help the plant grow thicker and denser. From three years and up, trim the sides of the hedge. You will want to trim the plant into the shape of an \u2018A\u2019 with a flat top so that light can reach all of the parts of the hedge equally.
