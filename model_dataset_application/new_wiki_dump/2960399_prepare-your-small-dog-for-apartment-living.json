          "description":"Outdoor space will be limited in the new apartment. Taking your small dog out in the yard less often before moving will help it get used to no longer having a yard for running around. Try not to abruptly stop taking your dog out in the yard. Make the transition gradual. This will give your dog time to adjust. Try shortening outside time a little more every few days. If your dog is used to being outside for two hours total every day, try shortening the time to an hour and 45 minutes. After three to four days of that, cut the time down to an hour and a half. Continue cutting the total time until the move. You can start shortening time outside in the yard each time you take the dog out to use the bathroom. Rather than let the dog run around, bring him back in as soon as he\u2019s done."

          "description":"Small dogs need exercise just like larger ones, but the opportunity to be outside will be limited in the apartment. A walk in the morning and one in the afternoon or evening will give your dog the daily exercise it needs. Plus, starting the walks before the move will help your dog adapt to its new routine after the move."

          "description":"Once you move, you\u2019ll no longer be able to play with your dog out in the yard whenever you want. Getting your dog used to indoor playtime before the move can help it more easily adjust to the new apartment. After the move, your dog will probably look forward to indoor playtime together. Play fetch with a soft toy that won\u2019t knock over any breakable items in your apartment. Play hide and seek with a bone, ball, or dog toy. Show your dog the item, then hide it somewhere and let your pooch find it. Practice old and new tricks, such as sit or roll over. Let your dog proudly show you he\u2019s still good at tricks he\u2019s already learned. Then challenge him by teaching a new trick. Create a small obstacle course for your dog to navigate. Choose an area with the most open floor space, such as the living room. Then set up a few items for the dog to climb or jump over, or to go around or crawl through. You can use boxes, crates, chairs, baskets, or anything you have on hand."

          "description":"Training pads work great with small dogs. The pads can absorb any accidents your dog might have in the new apartment. You can also choose to train your dog to intentionally go on the training pads all the time since you won\u2019t have a yard for the dog to go in. Place training pads in areas of your home similar to where you plan to have them in the apartment. For instance, keep one in or near the bathroom and do the same once you move. This will help your dog more easily find the pads after moving to the new place."

You and your dog will both be better prepared for life in the apartment. Items you might need for your small dog in the apartment include training pads, a leash for walks, and toys for indoor playtime."

When one of you is out, the other can stay with the dog. This isn\u2019t always possible due to work schedules and other commitments, but doing it when you can will be comforting to your dog. It shouldn\u2019t be necessary to continue having someone stay home indefinitely. Once your dog shows signs of feeling at ease in the apartment, try leaving it home alone. You can tell your dog is feeling comfortable when it holds its ears and tail in their natural, relaxed positions when you are getting ready to leave. Skip this step if you live alone."

Even the smallest dog can become too noisy and annoy the neighbors when barking for its owner. To help your pup get used to being without you in the new apartment, step out briefly. Check your mail, chat with a neighbor down the hall, or run a quick errand.

Make the space comfortable by placing familiar items there, such as a favorite toy or blanket. These should be items your dog had in the old home before the move.
