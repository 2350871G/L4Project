          "description":"Choose from a bed that's as small as a single at 30 inches (76 cm) wide to as big as a California king at 72 inches (180 cm) wide. Consider the amount of space you have in your bedroom and what will fill the area without crowding it. Measure your room to figure out the ideal size bed. A good rule of thumb is to leave 24 to 36 inches (61 to 91 cm) of empty space around the bed so you can move around it easily. Take into account whether you're sharing your bed with a partner. For example, if they toss and turn a lot, you might want a wider king bed instead of a full bed."
