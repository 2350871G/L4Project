      "description":"While using bleach will typically lessen or remove any remaining stains, it will probably change the color of the carpet. Mix 2-1/2 cups (.59 l) of liquid chlorine bleach in a 5 gallon (18.9 L) (18.9 l) bucket. Using undiluted bleach will dissolve wool fibers in the carpet and may irritate your skin. Dribble the bleach mixture on wet carpet. Use a plastic brush to rub it into the carpet. After about 5 minutes, rinse the carpet thoroughly with a garden hose to remove all bleach residue."
