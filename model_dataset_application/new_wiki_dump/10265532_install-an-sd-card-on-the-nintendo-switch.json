You can confirm this by selecting gear icon (System Settings), and then selecting Data Management. You will see the available micro SD card storage space displayed in the upper-right corner. If you insert a micro SD card with data on it, you will be asked to format the micro SD. Select Format and follow the instructions to format the micro SD card. You will loose all data on the micro SD card, so be sure to backup anything you want to keep. If you install a micro SDXC card, you may be asked to update the system in order to use the microSD card. If you see this, tap System Update in the pop-up and follow the instructions to update the system."
