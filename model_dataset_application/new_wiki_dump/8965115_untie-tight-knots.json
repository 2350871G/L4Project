For small, tight knots, try using the fine teeth of a plastic comb or one tong of a fork. On larger knots, you might be able to use a bamboo skewer. Anything pointed and not too sharp will do. Slip the implement of your choice into the knot. Wiggle it back and forth a bit. Without removing the implement you worked into the knot, pull at one portion of the knot to see it if it comes apart. If the knot is still too tight to untie, wiggle the implement you placed in it a bit more, or take it out and try to push something with a slightly wider girth into the space you opened up. Afterwards, try to untie it again."

Start with a gentle but firm tap using moderate force. After a few taps, test the knot to see if it can be untied. If not, continue, adding force gradually each time you check the knot. Be sure that whatever is beneath the knot will not be damaged by the impact."

The combination of forward motion and stomping on the ground will naturally loosen the shoelace knot over time. The amount of time you will need to spend walking or running before your tight knot is loosened sufficiently varies depending on the severity of the knot. Very tight knots will take longer to loosen than knots that are merely tight. Start by walking about for 10 minutes or so, then testing the knot in your shoelace. If it is still tight, walk a bit more."

  "text":" Pushing and Pulling Twist one end of the knot. Extending from any knot are two \u201carms.\u201d  Grab one of these arms and start turning it.
