          "description":"One good way to prepare for your speech is to look for people who have already done it. Find other great graduation speeches, and look at the themes they hit and the jokes they told. You don\u2019t want to copy them, just look for ideas that reflect your experiences or potential themes you can use. Some famous addresses include:\nSteve Jobs at Stanford in 2005\nJ.K. Rowling at Harvard in 2008\nDavid Foster Wallace at Kenyon in 2009"

        {
          "headline":"Find a theme.",
          "description":"Consider what you want your audience to get out of the speech, such as inspiration or reflection on good times. Draw from your own experience and the experiences of your classmates. Good themes include:\n\u201cFind and follow your passion\u201d\n\u201cYou do not need to be perfect\u201d\n\u201cIf you think and believe you can, you can\u201d\n\u201cTry selflessness and give back\u201d"

          "description":"List your big theme, then all the points you are going to make in support of it. Include space for jokes and stories as well. This will remind you of all the points you want to hit so you don\u2019t forget any while writing. It can also show you how long your speech is, and maybe let you know that some things need to get cut. Your outline should include multiple parts, sections, and subsections."
        },

          "headline":"Talk to other students.",
          "description":"This ceremony isn\u2019t just for you, it\u2019s for everyone, and each person\u2019s experience at school will have been a little different. Talk to other students, including people who aren\u2019t your friends or you don\u2019t know very well. Learn about how they saw their time in school, and what kinds of memories they will take with them. Note any themes or trends amongst the students. Find the most common and important ones, and stick with those. Don't forget the smaller memories and lesser-known stories. Mentioning them during your speech will help make those people feel noticed."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Remember your audience.",
          "description":"This speech is for you and your fellow graduates. While it would be nice to thank your teachers and parents for getting you to graduate, remember that you and your classmates are the main focus. Make sure you are speaking to them first and foremost. If you aren\u2019t sure how your speech will go, think about if you were listening to it. Is this the kind of speech you would like to hear at your graduation? If you\u2019re not sure you would enjoy it, your fellow students probably won\u2019t either."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Keep it short.",
          "description":"Your speech is just one part of a larger ceremony, and people probably won\u2019t want to listen to you give a half-hour lecture on the nature of friendship and the universe. Keep your thoughts short and to the point. Plus, if you  don\u2019t like giving speeches, keeping it short will make it go faster. Talk to your principal or teachers to get a sense of how much time you have. If they don\u2019t have good guidelines, 5 to 10 minutes should be more than enough. The average speaker reads about 120 words in a minute. That is a little less than 1 page of double-spaced,16-point font, which you\u2019ll want because it is easier to read."

Make sure you leave them with your biggest idea, even if that\u2019s just restating the big idea you laid out the in beginning. This will be the last thing anyone hears, making it the thing they will most likely remember from your speech. Keep the message short, brief and to the point. This will make it easier to remember. Your message does not have to be philosophical or mundane. It can be humorous."

You can make a list of names, including your parents, teachers, and friends. Just remember to be brief, and turn your attention back to the graduates. One way to make this more accessible to the rest of the class is to finish this section by encouraging or reminding the other graduates to thank someone too."

          "headline":"Include a few jokes.",
          "description":"Adding a few lines in your speech to encourage laughter will help you and your audience get comfortable. It can also briefly take people\u2019s minds off of the bigger, weightier topics you\u2019ll be talking about. You don\u2019t have to be voted \u201cClass Clown\u201d to be able to tell a good joke. Just stay relaxed and confident in your delivery, and if people don\u2019t laugh, just move on. One style of joke is the funny inspirational quote, like Will Rogers\u2019s \u201cEven if you\u2019re on the right track, you\u2019ll get run over if you just sit there,\u201d or Ben Franklin\u2019s \u201cYou will find the key to success under the alarm clock.\u201d These clever lines can be a good start to a speech, introducing your big theme. Look for funny stories specific to your school. These can help personalize your speech, and reference things that most of the audience will recognize. You can make fun of school construction that was \u201cbuilding the future one closed hallway at a time.\u201d\nYou only need to include a few jokes. This is a valedictorian speech, not an audition for your stand-up comedy career. Remember to write them down and rehearse them just like the rest of your speech. You don\u2019t stumble over the punchlines or forget how they go on the big day. Keep it clean. Your audience will include teachers, parents, grandparents, and siblings, including your own, so make sure your jokes are appropriate for all."

Graduation is a time to celebrate all that you have done, including finishing high school. Make sure you mention specific accomplishments. Look for sports championships, awards, charity events, anything that you or your classmates accomplished during your time in high school. The more examples you can include that don\u2019t involve you, the better. You are celebrating your whole class\u2019 accomplishments, not just your own."

          "description":"Graduation is also a time to look forward to the future. Spend some time talking about what will happen after graduation. Because you don\u2019t really know the future, this section can be a bit more vague and aspirational. Remember to stay positive, and think about what good will come next. As the valedictorian, you are probably going on to college after graduating. That may not be true for everyone in your class, so don\u2019t forget to mention other possible avenues like getting a job or serving in the military. If you aren\u2019t sure what kinds of things your classmates are doing after graduation, that\u2019s a great thing to ask when you talk to them."

          "headline":"Tell a personal story.",
          "description":"One good way to illustrate your theme and tie your story to past experiences is to tell a personal story. Think about an experience you had in high school that taught you the big lesson from your theme. If it includes your friends, or others in the audience, even better. This is a good way to personalize your big theme, and let your classmates know about your particular high school experience. If you don\u2019t have a specific funny story about you or your friends, consider talking about how you\u2019ve changed over your time in high school. Think about how you felt when you started as a freshman, how you got lost in the large school, or couldn\u2019t reach your locker. A personal story is also a good way to add a little self-deprecating humor, as long as you are comfortable telling a story where you don\u2019t look brilliant or cool."

Hearing them is a sign that your audience can stop listening, which you definitely don\u2019t want. This means quotes too. One or two good quotes from famous people can be useful, as long as they relate directly to your main point. Remember that people want to hear you talk, not recite a list of famous lines."

This will let you see how long your speech goes (and if it is too long), as well as how it actually sounds when you say it out loud. If you can, recreate the setting as much as possible. Wear your cap and gown so you will be comfortable in them, and practice at the podium or where the graduation is, if possible.

Graduation is an emotional time for everyone involved, and it is understandable that you\u2019ll get a little choked up thinking about your friends and classmates. Letting one or two tears out can be fine. You can always pass it off by blaming allergies, or make a joke about it being dusty in the room."

If anything, it just might take some of the pressure off of you. Relax, have fun, and stick to your big ideas. The important thing is that you find a message that you care about and think is important."
