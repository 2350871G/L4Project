If you are using steel or other metals, place the welder on the DC Electrode Negative (DCEN) setting. If your welder has a high frequency setting, it will also need adjusting. For aluminum, the switch will need to be on continuous high frequency. For steel, it should be on high frequency start."

Make sure to grind in a radial direction around the circumference of the tungsten, not straight toward the ends. Use the face of a fine stone to grind the tungsten electrode. Grind so that the electrode is pointing in the same direction as the rotation of the stone as a safety precaution. Grind the tungsten to a balled tip for AC welding and a pointed tip for DC welding. To make a butt weld or open corner weld ground the tungsten to a five to six millimeter stick."

Shift the valve body by quickly opening and closing the valve to clean any debris out of the threaded valve body. Screw the regulator on, then screw the nut tight while simultaneously twisting the regulator until it is seated in the valve. Tighten the regulator using a spanner, making sure that the pressure knob is backed off counter-clockwise. Put on the gas hose and flowmeter, then turn on the cylinder valve. Make sure to turn on the cylinder valve gently and in small increments. Usually a quarter-turn revolution is enough. Finally, check for any leaks by listening for a wheezing sound or using an aerosol leak detector spray. Set the gas flow rate by adjusting the cylinder regulator. Though the rate may vary depending on your project, usually the rate stays between four and 12 liters (3.2 US gal) per minute."
