          "description":"Whirlpool tubs require extensive electrical wiring and a pump, which need to be within a few feet of the tub. If you have a closet or cabinet adjacent to the tub, it can be stored there. If not, you\u2019ll need to get an alcove tub with an apron or a drop-in tub that\u2019s built into a deck. These styles will hide the electrical equipment. Pump size will depend upon how many jets your tub has, but you may need up to 2 square feet (.6 square meters) of storage space for the pump. If you have an adjacent space to store the pump, you can opt for a freestanding tub like a claw-foot tub."

And unless you\u2019re building a brand new bathroom, get the measurements of the bathroom doorway to be sure your new tub will fit through it. A standard tub is about 30 to 32 inches (76 to 81 cm) wide, 60 inches (152 cm) long, and 14 to 20 inches (35 to 50 cm) deep. Most tubs should fit through a standard 32-inch (81-cm) bathroom door. But some older homes have narrower doors, so measure to be sure. If you\u2019re interested in a drop-in tub, keep in mind that the deck it drops into will take up a few extra inches of bathroom space all the way around the tub."

Aim for your water heater to have at least \u2154 the capacity of any tub you buy. For example, a 75-gallon (284-liter) tub should have a 50-gallon (189-liter) water heater. The smallest water heater you should have is between 30 and 40 gallons (113 and 151 liters). If budget's not an issue and you have a large family, you can get a 100-gallon (378-liter) water heater."
