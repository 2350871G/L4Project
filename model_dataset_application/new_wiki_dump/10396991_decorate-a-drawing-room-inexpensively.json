          "description":"Walk around your house and look for decor in other rooms or closets. For example, the stacks of books collecting dust in your hall closet would look so whimsical piled by the fireplace. You\u2019d be surprised at what you have laying around that can become \u201cnew\u201d decor. Choose things that serve multiple purposes. For instance, the vintage suitcase tucked away under your bed could become a stylish storage spot in your drawing room. How to Shop Each Room in Your House\nKitchen: Hang pretty plates as a gallery wall or use empty mason jars or glasses as makeshift flower vases. You can decorate coffee and side tables with pretty cloth napkins or dish towels. Bathroom: Arrange elegant perfume bottles on a side table. Bedroom: Use a woven or canvas hamper as a storage bin for throw blankets or hang a handmade quilt on the wall. Grab decorative throw pillows and blankets to put on the sofa or any chairs. Basement or Playroom: Spray tiny toy figurines with gold or silver paint to incorporate into a tabletop display or nail vintage board games to the wall."

          "description":"Gather all of your standing frames, figurines, candles, vases, and other tiny trinkets together to create a styled cluster on your coffee table or side table. Choose one piece, like your favorite stained glass urn or an antique hand mirror, to be your anchor. Group the other pieces around it. Vary the heights, shapes, sizes, and textures of the items in your cluster for added visual impact. For example, pair tall candlesticks with circular picture frames and a wooden \u201cA\u201d monogram. Don\u2019t put a vignette on every surface or your room will look cluttered. Stick to 1 or 2 for a clean style. Hardcover books with their dust jackets removed can make an attractive space-filler. Look for vintage books at a thrift store. You can arrange them in stacks or display them with other items."

Have family portraits blown up at a print shop or office store for oversized wall decor that doesn\u2019t cost a fortune. You can also get photos printed on canvas for display as art pieces. Try framing a favorite family photo and displaying it on a coffee table."

Scattering plants around the drawing room instantly adds life and warmth. If you don\u2019t have a green thumb, consider hardier house plants like succulents, herbs, peace lilies or philodendrons. Ask your friends and family if they have any plants you can take a cutting from to plant yourself. Good plants for propagating include spider plants, African violets, and any type of fern. If you don\u2019t want to worry about caring for live plants, get some fake plants or dried arrangements to decorate your space."

Invest in your staple pieces but keep the rest of the room free of clutter and unnecessary accessories. Think less is more. For example, a side table might simply have a lamp and a stack of coasters instead of a cluster of picture frames, a basket, some candles, and a flowerpot. Use your new style as an excuse to clean out your room and donate or throw away anything you no longer use or want.

          "description":"Whether it\u2019s painting plain white walls a bright hue or changing the color of a previously painted wall, a fresh coat on your walls will refresh your space. Stick to a color in your current color scheme so you don\u2019t have to replace all of your decor. Save money on paint while also making a style statement by only painting 1 wall as an accent wall. For example, if the walls are currently pale blue, paint 1 wall a deep navy. Follow the 60-30-10 rule. Keep 60% of the space the dominant color in your scheme, 30% in the secondary color, and 10% in a bold accent color. Pre-mixed cans of paint that were made by accident at hardware stores are cheaper than ordering a custom color. Another option is to purchase peel and stick wallpaper. Wallpaper can be pricey, but it can make a big impact on the appearance of a room. Think of it as investing in a piece of decorative \u201cfurniture.\u201d"

Think about how you\u2019ll be using the room and how people will move through it, then arrange your couch, chairs, table, and other furniture accordingly. For example, don\u2019t block walkways or doorways with chairs. And don\u2019t place the coffee table so far away from the sofa that guests can\u2019t reach it. You can also find new uses for old furniture. For example, you might use an old footstool as a place to set books or a potted plant, or you could repurpose an old trunk as a coffee table. Large cushions could become floor seating. According to the popular Chinese art of feng shui, the couch should be against a wall, facing the entryway of the room. Arrange chairs close by to encourage conversation."

You can even change up the print, texture, or color for a temporary accent. You can buy covers from a furniture store or online retailer or you can make your own.

If you don\u2019t know how to sew, you can paint patterns on pillows with fabric paint. A stencil will help you get the perfect print. For a glam vibe, sew or glue sequins onto the pillow.

          "description":"For the best mood lighting, have 3 sources of light in your drawing room. These could be table lamps, floor lamps, sconces, or pendant lamps. Consider what you\u2019ll be doing in the room, too. For example, if you\u2019ll be reading, include a reading light by the chair. Avoid overhead lighting when possible. It tends to be very harsh. Candles are a great lighting option for a cozy, warm glow. Dimmers, which allow you to lower the lights, make a space feel more romantic. Installing dimmers typically costs about $100. Hang string lights around the room or place puck lights under the furniture to create a glow."

Personalize it with the paint, stain, or finish of your choice that matches the rest of your room. Ask the furniture store if they have an extra sample of the wood from your piece. It\u2019s a good way to test different colors and stains before you commit to one. You can also buy unfinished furniture from hardware stores and flea markets. When it comes to finishes, choose from flat, satin, or gloss. If you aren\u2019t sure which you want, start with flat. It\u2019s easier to add sheen to a flat paint rather than toning down a glossy finish. Always sand your furniture before applying paint or stain for an even color."

Instead, buy cheaper small rugs and overlap them to create visual interest and fill the space. Play around with textures and shapes, too. Pair a square woven rug with a circular faux fur rug, for instance. You can also buy an inexpensive large rug and then place a smaller rug on top. For example, a budget-friendly jute rug underneath a smaller Persian rug warms up the room."
