Choose a water pump with suction cups on the bottom so it stays in place when in the fountain. The plastic tubing is used to direct where the water goes. The most common size is 5/8\u201d outer diameter and 1/2\u201d inner diameter."

      "headline":"Buy a container.",
      "description":"Your container can be made out of ceramic, glass, plastic, or metal. Clay containers that are not already sealed need to be sealed or lined with plastic. To make a fountain in a basket, you can put a waterproof container inside the basket and hide it with rocks or plants."
