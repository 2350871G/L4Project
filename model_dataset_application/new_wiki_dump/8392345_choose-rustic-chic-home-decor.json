          "description":"Before you get too eager to shop for new pieces, scan the room you\u2019re planning on decorating. Take note of its size, layout, flooring, walkways, doors, windows, cabinets and other features. The rustic furnishings you pick out should be appropriate for the specific look of each room so that the new atmosphere feels like a natural extension. Some pieces will look better in certain places than others. Whenever you\u2019re picking out your decor, trust your instincts when deciding where in your home or room it should go. If you could use a fresh set of eyes, seek out the professional opinion of an interior designer."

          "headline":"Stick with a neutral color scheme.",
          "description":"Rustic chic decor is by definition muted and minimal. Forget about bright colors, elaborate patterns or gleaming burnished fixtures. Instead, focus on monochromatic pieces in complementary hues and materials. This basic setting will act as a blank canvas so that you can add personality later by using smaller decorations. Appliances and fixtures in dark, plain shades will go with a wider range of items. Vary your tones between rooms. The sun room will benefit from light shades like pine and cream, while the bedroom or study can be done in dark grays, browns and blacks with splashes of color."

          "headline":"Keep furnishings simple.",
          "description":"Simplistic items are wonderful on their own, but too many of them can easily start to look busy. Resist the urge to incorporate more and more into a room. Get a few essential pieces, like a maple coffee table or a rich brown leather loveseat, and let them speak for themselves. Limiting the number of pieces in a given room also helps maximize your space. A room full of items in all the same style or shade can quickly become monotonous."

          "description":"If you\u2019re having trouble planning an updated layout for the room or deciding on the perfect spot for new decorations, one good place to start would be getting furniture and accessories that you don\u2019t want anymore. Dull, uninteresting items can be sold, donated or discarded to make room for fresh finds. Assuming you\u2019re not ready to part with a particular piece just yet, you could also have it reupholstered and appreciate it from a new perspective. Sometimes even small changes can make a big difference. You might not have to totally overhaul your living space in order to breathe new life into it. Give your old furniture a new home in another room, or store it until you find another use for it."

Oak, cedar, mahogany and walnut are all excellent choices for wood furnishings. To complete the rustic aesthetic, look for pieces with attractive staining, irregular angles and other unique touches like bits of preserved bark.

Because of their shabby chic characteristics, raw and distressed metals are best used sparingly to offset woods and other finishes. Lamps, bookends and table legs are good places to weave in metal accents. Use vintage metal containers in the kitchen in place of traditional ceramic jars."

Your living space will have just the right amount of wildness while still looking like it leapt off the pages of a storybook. If you live near scenic surroundings, switch to a more \u201cexposed\u201d layout with uncovered windows and natural lighting to bring a glimpse of the outside in. Make sure you\u2019re buying from humane sources. Imitation fur and other materials look like the real thing, but are both ethical and sustainable."
