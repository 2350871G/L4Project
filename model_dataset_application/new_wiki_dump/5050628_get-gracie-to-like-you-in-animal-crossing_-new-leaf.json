To get the Home Center (T.I.Y), you need to have spent 50,000 bells in the shop and waited 21 days since you got the Super T&T, the second upgrade. Once you have T.I.Y, Gracie will be able to visit. Gracie\u2019s visits are, however, rare, so you may find yourself waiting a long time before you see her. To make sure you don\u2019t miss her, play every day and check the area around the town square thoroughly! You can skip ahead days to increase your chances of seeing her."

Clothing can belong to one of ten different themes: basic, cute, historical, iconic, flashy, modern, official, ornate, rock n\u2019 roll, or sporty. Often times, it is easy to use common sense to figure out which theme any given piece of clothing will belong to."

If Gracie tells you to follow the basic theme and you wear something rock n\u2019 roll or flashy along with your other basic clothes, that counts as clashing. Below is a list of clashing themes:\nRock n\u2019 roll and flashy clash with the basic theme. Nothing clashes with the cute theme. Nothing clashes with the historical theme. Nothing clashes with the iconic theme. Official and basic clash with the flashy theme. Nothing clashes with the modern theme. Sporty, rock n\u2019 roll and flashy all clash with the official theme. Nothing clashes with the ornate theme. Official and basic clash with the rock n\u2019 roll theme. Official clashes with the sporty theme."

You can keep extra clothing on the floor in your home or stored in dressers for a tidier house. You can also dress any mannequins you have. You can easily swap clothes with a mannequin if you need to."
