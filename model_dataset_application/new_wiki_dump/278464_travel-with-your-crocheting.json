Coasters and granny squares are a good idea, as they are small and don't require a lot of yarn. The designs of these can also vary quite a bit, and can turn out really pretty! Bracelets, headbands, and bows are also small projects that don't use a lot of yarn. These are also great for accessorizing yourself, or as gifts for friends."

You can also check your local craft store to see if there are any there."
