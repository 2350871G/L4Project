Before placing your wood down on the ground, you\u2019ll want to remove any leaf matter and other debris from the ground. This is important, as undergrowth and debris will retain moisture, which could lead to your wood rotting. If you want, you can place a couple pieces of wood on the ground and cover them with pressure-treated 2x4s so most of your wood will be elevated. This will help keep your wood dry and reduce rot. Place your wood bark side up. Begin by placing your firewood bark side up against the 2x4s on one side of the rack.

By placing your wood bark side up, you\u2019ll help it dry and stop it from leaching moisture down into the stack. Fit the pieces together like a puzzle. When placing each piece of wood down, fit them together like a puzzle. If you have a wedge shape, try to fit it into a proper space. Fit square or rectangular pieces into square or rectangular holes. Leave space between each piece of firewood. While you want to stack your wood together like a puzzle so that you fit a lot of wood on your rack, you need to make sure there is some space between your pieces. This will provide air flow so that your wood stays dry and does not rot. You may need to purposefully place some pieces so they don\u2019t fit like a puzzle. Do this when appropriate. Stack the wood until it is 4 feet high (1.22 meters). Continue stacking your wood \u2013 like a puzzle, but making sure there is air flow \u2013 until your pile has reached 4 feet high (1.22 meters). Don't go above 4 feet (1.22 meters), as your stack could topple. Provide support for your stack. If you notice your stack leaning to one side, you can use poles or branches to prop up the stack. Simply place them at a 45-degree angle to the stack and press them into the ground a little bit. Placing Irregular Wood on Your Rack Sort your wood by size and shape. Create a pile for plywood, a pile for 2x4s, and a pile for irregular wood pieces. Like pieces should be placed together. This way, you\u2019ll have an easier time stacking everything. Place plywood and tall pieces of wood vertically. Take your plywood and lean it against the poles you placed in the ground. The plywood should lean slightly onto the poles.
