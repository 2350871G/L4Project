  "text":" Making the Filling and Preparing the Cakes Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit or 176 degrees Celsius.  Flour and spray non-stick greasing spray on four ramekins.  Pour the milk and the pudding mix into a small bowl.  Whisk the milk and pudding mix until smooth and there are no more lumps.  Cover the small bowl with plastic wrap.  Allow the pudding to sit for about five minutes until it's thick.  Making the Lava Cake Combine the chopped chocolate and milk in a large microwave-safe.  Microwave the chocolate for about a minute, stirring every now and then until fully melted.  Whisk the flour, baking powder, and oil together in a separate large bowl.  Pour in the melted chocolate mixture and stir.  Pour the batter into each ramekin until halfway full.  Add two tablespoons of the Oreo filling into the center of each ramekin.  Pour the rest of the batter into ramekin and place them on a baking tray.  Bake the lava cakes for about 17-18 minutes, until the cakes rise slightly and begin to set.  Remove the cakes from the oven and allow them to cool.  Place a small plate on each ramekin and flip it over to place the cake on each plate.  Serve.
