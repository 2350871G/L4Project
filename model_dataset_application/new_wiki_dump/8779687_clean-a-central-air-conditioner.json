          "description":"There should be an outdoor shutoff near the condenser unit. This will resemble a square box on the wall of the apartment or house. Inside, look for a switch that you can slide to the \u201cOFF\u201d position. If there is no switch, you\u2019ll need to manually pull the plug which feeds power to the condenser. Before you begin disassembling any portion of the condenser, it\u2019s crucial that you disable the power supply. If you cannot find the power outlet where the compressor unit is plugged in, or if you\u2019re inclined to be extra cautious, you can simply flip the switch to \u201cOFF\u201d in the circuit breaker box which controls power to the AC condenser."

A wet/dry vacuum is the tool best suited for this job. The condenser unit sucks in air through these fins. Over the course of time, these will become dirty with bits of leaves, grass, and dust. If you don\u2019t have a wet/dry vacuum, see if any of your friends or neighbors have one. You may also be able to rent a wet/dry vacuum from your local hardware store."

If you notice that any of the fins are crooked or have been twisted, you can use a knife or kitchen utensil to gently straighten the fins. Apply gentle, steady pressure to bend the fins back into position. If you use excessive force, you risk snapping off the fins or damaging them further."

Using a screwdriver, remove the wiring on top of the fan, and then unscrew and remove the fan itself. Due to the wires connecting the fan motor to the compressor unit, you may not be able to fully lift off the fan. You\u2019ll simply have to lift the fan as far out of its housing as possible."

To make sure that the fan blades are clean, you can also wipe them off with a clean cloth or rag. Then, use the hose again to spray water through the compressor\u2019s fins from the inside of the unit. Rinsing the fins from the inside will make sure that any obstructions are cleared, and the unit can effectively draw in air."

To quickly tell a disposable from a reusable air filter, inspect the material it\u2019s made from.

To make sure that the drain hasn\u2019t gotten clogged, you can run a stiff wire through the drain. If the plastic pipe is flexible, poke the wire into the bottom of the pipe as well, to make sure that it\u2019s not clogged. In some more modern units, the pipe which drains water runs directly into the floor, and does not have a drain. In this case, you do not need to clean the setup. Call a AC professional cleaner\u2014or your landlord\u2014if you notice water pooling around the base of the evaporator unit, or see water-damaged flooring nearby."
