Place the food in a shallow dish near where you think nests might be, and then watch the food trap. Yellow jackets should eventually show up near the food. Once they do, follow their path back to their nests. You can use protein-based baits, including tuna-flavored canned cat food, chicken skin, cold cuts, and ground meat. In the summer, sugar baits might work better. Try fruit juice, grenadine, ice cream, or a bit of fruit jelly."

Don\u2019t try to mark the nest directly \u2013 spraying it or poking a marker flag into it can upset the colony and cause the yellow jackets to swarm and attack you."
