This option will likely cover your couch and be durable, but it's not going to give you as smooth a finish as leather paint will. Try a \"chalkboard\" paint. The advantage of this paint is that it's highly durable and relatively cheap. Just mix two parts powdered calcium carbonate with one part water and four parts latex paint, then use as normal. You can find calcium carbonate online or at some home improvement stores. You can also use textile medium. For each quart of latex paint, mix in two 8-ounce bottles of textile medium. You can find textile medium at most craft stores. It makes the paint dry softer and more flexible, and it also helps it bond to the leather. Another option is using a paint mixture of two-thirds store-bought chalkboard paint and one-third water to create a thinner paint that you can use on leather."

A relatively smooth sponge will also work. If your couch has fine cracks, though, a sturdy paintbrush might work better. If you do choose a standard brush, pick a brush with a fine or synthetic bristle to help cut back on brush lines."

Use painters tape to tape off these areas. Keep in mind that you can also do things like pull off the couch skirt to give the couch a different look. Repair any major cracks with glue made for leather or a patch. Other people have had luck using E6000 glue. You will need to sand any repair you make so it is smooth for painting."

          "description":"One way to help keep the paint supple and smooth is to create thin layers, particularly if you're using a paint you made yourself. The thin layers will help keep the paint from cracking, as well. Of course, that means more work overall, but the end result will be better. Don't gob large amounts of the paint on the couch at a time. Create very thin, quick-drying layers."

The paint should be dry to the touch and not have any shiny spots."

On the next coat, make your strokes go perpendicular to the first layer. This process creates a smoother, stronger surface. Some people find a circular motion works better. Test your pattern in an inconspicuous place first before applying it to the whole couch."

Start with rougher sandpaper and work down to finer paper. Use your hand to decide when the paint is the right texture. Wipe or vacuum any dust that collects as you sand."

Choose from high gloss, semi-gloss, or matte, depending on the look you want for your couch. Apply a layer of the gloss at the end of the project. Some people find that using wax over a homemade paint can add durability and shine. However, it's not absolutely necessary."
