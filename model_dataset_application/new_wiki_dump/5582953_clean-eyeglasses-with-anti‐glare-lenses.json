          "description":"According to the American Optometric Association, using clean fingertips, warm water, and dish soap is the preferred way to clean your eyeglasses. Before you start the cleaning process, have a clean, soft, lint-free cloth or microfiber towel handy to dry your lenses after you've washed them. Avoid dish soaps that contain lotions or harsh solvent chemicals, like ammonia or alcohol. You should never touch your anti-glare lenses without wetting with them first. You\u2019ll be using your fingertips to clean your lenses, so wash away any lotion, dirt, oil, and other grime from your hands prior to cleaning your glasses. Don't touch your lenses with unwashed hands."

Avoid using towels that have served other purposes or have been stored in the kitchen. These will have likely picked up grease, dust, or cooking oil residue that\u2019ll smear or scratch your lenses. Don\u2019t use fabric softener or dryer sheets when laundering your eyeglass cloths. These substances can smear or leave residue on your lenses."

Once your glasses are scratched, there\u2019s nothing you can do to buff them out. It\u2019s especially important to avoid dry wiping anti-glare lenses.

Always keep them in a case when you\u2019re not wearing them, especially when toting them in a bag or purse. Try not to leave them out on your sink or vanity, since splatters from products like hairspray, perfume or cologne, and other cosmetics can damage or strip the anti-glare layer."
