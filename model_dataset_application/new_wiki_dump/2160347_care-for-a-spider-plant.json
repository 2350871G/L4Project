If your spider plant is indoors in a pot, select a potting medium like vermiculite or coco coir. Don't fret too much over the soil, as spider plants are very adaptable."

They also thrive in windowsills, though they should be set about 12 inches (30 cm) away from south-facing windows during the spring and summer months. Outdoor plants should have moderate to deep shade during the day, as too much direct sunlight may scorch a spider plant."

They prefer a temperature between 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C) to 80 \u00b0F (27 \u00b0C) and can't thrive in outdoor areas with freezing or searing temperatures. Spider plants thrive in humid climates, so place a humidifier in the same room as your spider plant."

Watering moderately or once per week during the first year should be sufficient to keep the soil consistently moist, but not overly wet. After the first year, you can water the plant sporadically.

When propagating the baby plants, it can help to place a cotton ball or wad of napkin in the cup of water to keep the roots from being immersed."
