You can collect coins from a lot of different sources. Coin dealers will have coins of varying prices that can help you build your collection. You can also get coins from internet dealers, which are great if you\u2019re looking for a specific coin."

          "description":"Grading coins is the process by which you determine certain qualities of the coin that affect the coin\u2019s worth. Where you\u2019re planning on being a dealer will affect the grading system you use, but you should be familiar with your country\u2019s grading system. For example, the American Numismatic Association has Grading Standards that include 16 grades. Each grade corresponds to the coin\u2019s circulation status, quality, and wear and tear. One of the best ways to learn how to grade coins is by working for an established dealer, even if you can only work there part-time."

Choose a few coins from your inventory that you want to sell and set up an internet auction on a website like eBay. Internet auctions can also help you build a reputation for having good inventory without the financial investment that an actual shop will take. You'll need to set up a seller's account on whatever website you use, and you might also want to set up a PayPal account to make getting paid for the coins easier. Don't leave your coins up for too long - get a good price but don't leave your inventory out there for too long."

The requirements for renting a table at a weekend show will vary from show to show. Search for shows happening near you, and then contact the show organizers to find out the details of renting a table. Renting a table will cost some money, but it's cheaper than setting up a whole store. Don't forget display cases for your coins!"
