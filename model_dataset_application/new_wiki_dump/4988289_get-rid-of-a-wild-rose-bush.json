Wear protective clothing and gloves and consider using eyewear.

To use a stump killer, prune off the branches and then saw the main stem of the bush down to a few inches from the ground. Apply the stump killer to the fresh cut wood. This will only work on living wood so if the bush is already dead or the stem you are applying it to is brown and dried out, it won\u2019t have the effect of killing the rest of the bush. You may need to drill holes into the stem to get the chemicals to penetrate if it doesn\u2019t seem to work the first time."

However, you should avoid removing the bush for several weeks to ensure the chemicals have spread right through the plant\u2019s root structure. You will probably want to remove the dead plant after the weed killer has done its job. This is to prevent the dead stump from becoming an eyesore or trip hazard. As the dead stump won\u2019t break down very quickly in the soil, you\u2019ll want to remove the bulk of it in before you can replant the area. A mattock will help you to remove the root crown and stump from the ground a few weeks after treating with the weed killer."
