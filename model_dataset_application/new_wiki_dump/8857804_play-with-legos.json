Then you can create a new pirate story to go along with the new landscape. This activity is also really good for exercising your ability to \u201cthink outside the box\u201d and imagine new solutions to familiar problems.

Taper the bricks as you make it taller, so that it eventually comes to a point. You could even have a competition between yourself and a friend to see who can make the tallest one!
