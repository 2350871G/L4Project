Examples of uses include:\nAdding one or more ribbon flags to a floral arrangement, picking up the colors of the flowers and leaves. Placing ribbon flags across the top of a cake. This can be especially effective on cakes made using royal icing. Glue to place cards. Stick the ribbon flag end right out over the edge and just have the end stuck to the card. Stand upright for best effect. Glue to hair barrettes or hair clips for a pretty feature. Use on a cheese platter for denoting different types of cheese by color. Use a fabric marker if you'd like to write on the flags but be aware that it may bleed, depending on the ribbon fabric, so test on a spare piece of the same ribbon first."
