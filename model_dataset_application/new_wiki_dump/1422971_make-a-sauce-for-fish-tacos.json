      "headline":"Cut the lime wedges.",
      "description":"Place 1 lime on a clean cutting surface with the stem cavity facing straight up and down. Using your pairing knife, cut the lime in half through the middle of the stem. With the flat side facing down, cut each half of the lime in half through the center of the stem cavity and set aside."

      "headline":"Trim and slice the cilantro.",
      "description":"Take approximately half of a bunch of cilantro and separate the stems from the individual leaves. Once all of the stems have been removed, place the cilantro leaves in a tight pile near the center of your cutting surface. Use a slow, slicing motion with a chef's knife to create thin, ribbon-like cuts cilantro pieces. Simply chopping the cilantro is not recommended as it will bruise the leaves, significantly changing the flavor of the herb. Set the cilantro aside."

    {
      "headline":"Add the lime and spices to the crema.",
      "description":"Place 16 oz. of crema or sour cream into a small to medium-sized mixing bowl. Add 1/4 tsp. of coriander, 1/4 tsp. of cumin and cayenne pepper to taste. Squeeze 2 of the lime wedges into the bowl and blend using a thin wire whisk. The consistency should be thin, but not watery. Add 1 more lime wedge if the crema is too thick to be poured."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Mix well.",
      "description":"Ensure that the consistency is not too thick to pour. If the sauce seems a bit thick, squeeze in the last lime wedge to thin out the sauce."

    {
      "headline":"Add the cilantro.",
      "description":"Mix in the cilantro last in order to avoid bruising it. Combine the sliced cilantro leaves with the other ingredients and mix slowly and gently until the leaves are evenly dispersed through the sauce. Add more cilantro to taste and set aside in a small covered serving bowl. The traditional fresh taco sauce is ready to serve."
