          "description":"If the ink or dye is fresh, then you may be able to remove it using just a clean, damp cloth. Try to wipe the dye or ink away in one motion, and then go back over the spot with a clean section of the cloth. Use your fingertip to help you clean a small area. Wrap the cloth over your fingertip and use it to rub the dyed or ink-covered area. You can also try adding a small amount of dish soap to the water. Be sure to wipe the wall with water only after wiping it with soapy water. Use a clean, smooth cloth first and then try a more abrasive cloth or a sponge if that does not work. Don\u2019t use an abrasive cloth if you don\u2019t have to. Avoid using too much water when you wipe down your walls. Wet the cloth and then wring out excess water so that the cloth feels damp."
