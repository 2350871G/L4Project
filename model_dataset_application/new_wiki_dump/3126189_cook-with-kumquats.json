  "text":" Kumquat Marmalade Finely chop the kumquats and oranges. Slice 24 kumquats and 2 oranges, while seeding the oranges as well. Measure the fruit in measuring cups. The measurement will vary depending on the size of the kumquats and oranges. Add 3 cups of water per each cup of fruit.  Cool the fruit and water. Let the fruit and water stand in a cool place for 12 hours, or even overnight. Bring the fruit mixture to a boil. Then, reduce the heat and let the fruit simmer until the rinds are very tender. Remove the fruit from the heat and measure it again.  Add one cup of sugar to the pot for every cup of fruit.  Add 1/4 cup of lemon juice to the mix. Juice two lemons to make this amount of lemon juice. Stir the ingredients together. Return the fruit to a pan and bring it to a boil again. Boil the mixture and stir occasionally until the mixture begins to look like gel -- this will happen when the temperature of the marmalade reaches 222\u00baF (105\u00baC). Remove from the heat. Skim off any foam that rose to the surface. Transfer the mixture into several jars. Leave at least 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of headspace in each jar and then seal the jars. Serve. Enjoy this tasty kumquat marmalade on wheat bread, over fruit, or on its own. Candied Kumquat Chop 4 kumquats roughly with a paring knife. Discard any large seeds if you see them, but don't worry if some are chopped or remain in the fruit. Heat 1 cup of water and 2 cups of sugar over high heat. Heat this mixture, stirring the sugar and water together, until it comes to a boil. Let the mixture simmer for 4 minutes.  Add the kumquats and simmer the ingredients for 10 more minutes. Stir the ingredients to combine the sugar and the chopped kumquats. Drain the kumquats through a sieve. Set the sieve over a bowl to collect the syrup. Return the syrup to the pan and let it simmer for 5 more minutes.  Combine the kumquats and 1/4 cup of the syrup. Stir these ingredients together. Serve. Enjoy these tasty candied kumquats on their own, in yogurt, or on top of a muffin or another dessert. If you don't want to eat them right away, you can put them in a jar and refrigerate them for up to two weeks. Kumquat Salad Place a shallow pan of water on the bottom oven rack. This will prevent the kumquats from drying out. Preheat the oven to 400\u00baF (204\u00baC).  Toss the kumquats with a teaspoon of olive oil and a pinch of salt. You should keep the 3/4 cup of kumquats whole instead of chopping them. Keep tossing until the ingredients are combined. Place the kumquats on a baking pan on the upper rack of the oven.  Roast them for 10 minutes.  Make the dressing. Whisk together 1/4 cup of olive oil and the juice from one lemon. Season this mixture to taste and keep stirring until the ingredients are combined. You can do this while the kumquats are roasting. Combine the kumquats, arugula, hazelnuts, and mint together in a large bowl. Combine the cooked kumquats, 1/4 lb. of arugula, 3/4 cup of shelled, toasted, and crushed hazelnuts, and 1 handful of chopped mint. Pour 1/4 cup of the dressing over the salad. You can add more dressing if it suits you. Serve. Season this salad with pepper to taste and enjoy it immediately.",
