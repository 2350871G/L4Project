Using a string to take the circumference measurement is more accurate that just using a measuring tape because the string is more flexible and bends easier to the tree. If the tree is very big, you can either recruit a friend to help with this method or bring along a thumb tack to secure the string to the tree."

  "text":" Using Household Items to Take Quick Measurements Use a common 12 inches (30 cm) ruler to measure a small tree. This is a great technique for a quick estimate, but not ideal for taking a precise measurement. Hold the ruler against the tree at DBH.

If the tree is very big, you can either recruit a friend to help with this method or bring along a thumb tack to secure the string to the tree. Measuring with Professional Specialty Tools Take an easy measurement with a tree caliper. To use a tree caliper, open the caliper wider than the tree, place its arms on either side at DBH, and close the caliper as tight as it will go around the tree. Then, read the number on the caliper at the point where the lower arm stopped on the guide to find the diameter. If the tree is oblong, take two measurements, one on the wide side and one on the narrow side, and calculate the average of both. If the tree is leaning, hold the caliper at the same angle of the lean. It should be perpendicular to the tree. Hold a tree-scale stick up to the tree for an estimated measurement. Hold the stick against the tree at DBH and 25 inches (64 cm) from your eyes. Then line up the left edge of the stick to the left edge of the tree and read the number on the stick that lines up with the right edge of the tree. Like the ruler method, this is not the most accurate way of measuring diameter, but is useful if you want a rough estimate. Get an accurate measurement by wrapping D-Tape around the trunk. Diameter tape or \u201cD-Tape\u201d is the most common tool that foresters use to measure tree diameters. All you have to do to use the tape is wrap it around the tree at DBH and read the number where the tape meets. This number is the diameter of the tree and there are no further calculations necessary.
