Squirrels have trouble getting past it. You can also hang your bird feeder on a thin wire between two poles; add empty thread spools or anything that will turn on the wire to help keep the squirrels off. You can also grease a bird feeder pole with vegetable oil to keep squirrels from climbing up!"

If you have these in your yard, you need to rake them up as often as they fall to avoid drawing squirrels to your yard. You may need to get out there to rake daily when the nuts are falling.

You can purchase them from home improvement stores or make your own out of sheet metal. To make your own, buy 26 gauge sheet metal and tin snips. Measure the circumference of the tree. Use a permanent marker to draw out a rectangle that's 2 to 3 feet (0.61 to 0.91 m) high. The length will be the circumference you measured plus the added inches/centimeters. Cut out the piece with tin snips. File the corners so they aren't so sharp. Drill 2 holes in each end of the metal. Attach wire to each end of 2 metal springs. Put the collar around the tree, then insert the wire from one end of the spring into the hole on one end of the collar. Insert the other end into the hole across from it on the other end of the collar. Do the same with the other spring. The springs allow the tree growth room."
