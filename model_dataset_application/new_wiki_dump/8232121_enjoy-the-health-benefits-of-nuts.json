          "description":"Snacking on nuts in 1 \u2013 2 ounce servings is one of the best ways to prevent yourself from eating other, less healthy foods. Further, nuts are both enjoyable and nutritious all on their own. This is especially true for raw nuts, or those that have not been artificially dried or seasoned. A 1-ounce serving of almonds will contain 20 \u2013 24 individual nuts. About 16 \u2013 18 cashews will provide a single serving, as will 18 \u2013 20 pecan halves. You only need to eat eight to 11 walnut halves for a full serving, while you can snack on nearly 50 pistachios before you\u2019ve eaten a 1-ounce serving. Mixing raw nuts with dried fruit and seeds is a great way to enjoy your snack even more, not to mention get more vitamins and minerals."

          "description":"Many people prefer the flavor and consistency of nuts that have been roasted. If you\u2019re purchasing dried nuts, always opt for unsalted, dry-roasted options, as opposed to those that have been oil-roasted. Unfortunately, it can be challenging to find dry roasted nuts outside of extremely popular snacking nuts, such as almonds. Further, roasting of any type will likely decrease the nutritional value of nuts overall. If a nut a has been dry-roasted, it will be specified on the product\u2019s labeling. Otherwise, there was likely oil added to the nuts during roasting. For maximum nutrition in roasted nuts, try roasting nuts yourself."

          "headline":"Choose nuts based on the fats they contain.",
          "description":"Different types of nuts have different types and amounts of fat. Fortunately, most of the fats in nuts are unsaturated, and can actually help you lose weight and keep your heart healthy when consumed in appropriate portions. That said, there\u2019s enough saturated fats in certain nuts to take note of. Almonds, hazelnuts, and chestnuts all have the benefit of being extremely low in saturated fat. As such, almonds and hazelnuts are especially good snacks, and chestnuts can be added freely to your meal to add nutrients and keep you full for a longer. Walnuts, pecans, and pistachios all have considerable health benefits, as well as moderate amounts of saturated fats. Definitely include these in your diet whenever possible, but don\u2019t snack on them all day. Brazil nuts, macadamias, and cashews are among those nuts that have the highest amounts of saturated fat. While these nuts can make great ingredients (especially if substituted for less healthy ingredients), they should be eaten less frequently than the nuts above, or in smaller quantities."

        {
          "headline":"Use nuts as a meal\u2019s protein.",
          "description":"If you're looking for ways to decrease your meat consumption, nuts provide an alternative protein option. Cashews, for instance, provide 5 grams of protein in each 1-ounce serving, as well as other nutrients, like iron (though it should be noted the iron in nuts is different and not as easily absorbed as the iron found in animal products). They also have much less saturated fat. By using cashews or another nut as the protein base, you can not only remove an unhealthy component of your meal, but add a healthy one instead. For example, cook a stir fry with plenty of vegetables. Instead of meat, add a handful of cashews right before removing the pan from the heat. The nuts will soften, as well as absorb the seasoning. Season with soy sauce, cayenne, garlic, and ginger. You can also mix cashew butter with these spices, and heat with a bit of water to make a sauce."

        {
          "headline":"Include nuts in side dishes.",
          "description":"Whenever you\u2019re cooking rice, noodles, or veggies, you can always add nuts. Nuts are great because they can add texture and protein to pretty much anything. They will increase the dish's nutritional value, as well as its ability to keep you feeling full for a longer period of time. For instance, brown rice with walnuts or cashews, ginger, raisins, and nutmeg can make for a great dish. Additionally, pecans and hazelnuts will add great flavor to many savory soups."
        },

          "headline":"Add nuts to something sweet.",
          "description":"A healthy diet can include sweets from time to time, and nuts will help maximize a treat\u2019s nutritional value. For instance, add nuts and granola to Greek yogurt and sweeten with honey. For an ice cream alternative, blend bananas, almond butter, almond milk, and dark chocolate in a food processor and freeze. Finally, add ground or whole macadamias to brownies or cookies, and reduce the amount of sugar and butter you include in the recipe."

          "description":"Almonds are one of the healthiest nuts. They are not only rich in unsaturated fats and calcium, they also have plenty of vitamin E and magnesium. Simply by eating 2 ounces \u2014 or about \u00bc cup \u2014 of almonds per day, you will get significant health benefits such as reducing your risk of heart disease. A handful of raw almonds and an apple is one of the most nutritional snacks you can eat. Favor whole nuts over flaked almonds, as the almond\u2019s skin contains compounds called flavonoids, which can help protect your heart."

          "headline":"Get healthy fats from walnuts.",
          "description":"These highly antioxidant nuts are particularly good sources of healthy fats. Namely, walnuts are the only nut that contain a significant amount of one of the healthiest omega-3 fatty acids, alpha-linolenic acid, which has a protective effect on bone metabolism. Just an ounce will provide your daily recommended intake. Keep the skin (the waxy, flaky material on the outer surface of walnut pieces), to make sure you\u2019re getting the healthy phenols these nuts offer. Simply chopping and adding walnuts to veggies, fruit, or any other dish is often the way to go. You can also puree walnuts with cooked lentils, olive or flax oil, and any herbs or spices you favor to make a dip for fresh veggies. Especially if you don\u2019t regularly eat fish, start eating more walnuts to increase your consumption of omega-3 fatty acids and decrease your risk for cardiovascular disease."

          "headline":"Stay energized with pecans.",
          "description":"Pecans are another especially healthy nut, containing no trans fat and providing plenty of vitamins and minerals like vitamin A, vitamin E, folic acid, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, several B vitamins and zinc. They\u2019re great for your heart, as they are known to lower cholesterol levels and prevent plaque buildup in your arteries. They also supply good amounts of the vitamins you need to access the energy provided by the food you eat. You\u2019ll reduce your chances of coronary heart disease by eating just one handful of pecans per day."

          "description":"Pistachios, for instance, are rich in vitamin B6, which is important for hormonal balance. They also contain antioxidants that help protect your eye health. Further, they are rich in potassium and fiber. Eat just three or four Brazil nuts per day to get your daily recommended amount of selenium. This mineral supports your thyroid function and immune system, among other health benefits. Get more B vitamins, fiber, and vitamin C from chestnuts. Though lower in protein than most other nuts, chestnuts have the least amount of fat and carbs. Macadamias are perfect for adding great flavor and texture to sweet dishes. Though they have an especially high amount of fat, they also include good amounts of magnesium, calcium and potassium."

          "headline":"Selecting nuts to purchase.",
          "description":"The best way to buy nuts that have been shelled is in vacuum-sealed containers. Always look for a freshness date. If the nuts themselves are visible, they should be uniform in size and free of any shriveling. If you're selecting nuts that are still in their shells, choose those with shells free of cracks or tiny holes. As a rule of thumb, raw whole nuts should feel heavier than they look. Shake nuts that are still in the shell. Avoid nuts that rattle, as this indicates they are likely no longer fresh. Tree nuts, including walnuts, pecans, and hazelnuts are somewhat seasonal, and will be fresh in late fall or early winter. When buying bulk nuts, make sure that they are fresh and firm to the touch. Limp, rubbery, musty, or rancid-smelling nuts should be avoided. Unfortunately, bulk nuts lose their freshness rather quickly. You can purchase nuts either shelled or still in the shell. This is mostly a matter of convenience, though nuts that are still in their shell will keep longer, especially at room temperature."

          "headline":"Store nuts in the fridge.",
          "description":"The nutritional quality of most nuts will be preserved for a few months at room temperature. However, both flavor and nutritional value will persist longer in nuts that are stored at a lower temperature. Use an airtight container to store your nuts in the fridge, and they\u2019ll last a year or more. Ideally, your fridge should be set to 40 degrees F (4 degrees C). Nuts will last even longer - up to two years - in a freezer set to 0 degrees F (-18 degrees C). A nut that is no longer fresh will begin to taste rancid. While it is not unsafe to eat a nut that is beginning to taste differently, many people find the taste undesirable."

          "headline":"Roast nuts at home.",
          "description":"If you prefer the taste of roasted nuts but want to maximize their nutritional value, roast nuts yourself. This will allow you to use lower roasting temperatures, and minimize the reduction of the nuts' nutritional value. Arrange a single layer of nuts on an non-greased stainless steel baking sheet. Bake in the oven for ten to twenty minutes. Generally speaking, the shorter the cook time, the better. Feel free to check on the nuts, and shake the pan periodically to ensure uniform roasting. Don\u2019t roast a large amount of nuts at once for storage. The nutritional quality and flavor of roasted nuts will degrade more rapidly than nuts that are stored raw. As such, only roast as much as you want to eat over the course of a few weeks."
