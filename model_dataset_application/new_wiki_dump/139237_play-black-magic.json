Tell them that you will be pointing to different objects in the room, and asking whether each one is the object you're thinking of. They should keep answering \"No\" but pay attention to the color of the object you are pointing to. When you point to a black object, they will answer \"No\" again, but the next object you point to will be the right answer. They should answer \"Yes\" to that one.

If they can't hear you, send out a group of several people to bring them back. If you only send one person, the rest of the group might think they are telling the assistant the object, making the trick less mysterious."

As long as you remember to avoid black objects, your assistant should answer \"No.\" Try pointing in different ways, using two fingers for one object, then vaguely waving at the next. People will suspect that you and your partner have set up a specific code with your gestures, which will lead them down the wrong trail and make it harder for them to guess the real method.

For example, if someone guesses that you always point at the right object on the fifth question, repeat the trick with a different object and point to it on the third try, or the eighth. To keep your audience guessing longest, use the variations in the section below. If you set it up in advance, you can even come up with an elaborate plan with your assistant. For instance, you can use the \"black\" method the first time, the number method the second time, and the black method again the third time."

Suspicious audience members might look at you during the game, so this is a difficult method to pull off. Stand behind the audience members if possible, and make other small motions that aren't part of the code to mislead your audience. An assistant who can distract the audience's attention is even better for pulling off this version of the game.

All other words are \"bad.\" Have your audience say words aloud, then tell them whether each word is good or bad. Your audience members should try to guess just by naming words; ask them not to guess at the rule aloud, so that other people who haven't figured it out yet can keep guessing."

Pick a close family member or friend, since you are more familiar with talking to them, and watch them closely. Have them say \"I'm thinking of __.\" while looking at you, and try to figure out when they are lying based on their facial expressions, movements, and tone of voice. Most psychologists and other researchers do not believe in the existence of \"Extra-Sensory Perception\" or other mysterious abilities that transmit thoughts, but there are plenty of studies on that topic if you're interested in learning more."
