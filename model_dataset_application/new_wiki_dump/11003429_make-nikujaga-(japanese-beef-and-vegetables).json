  "text":" Preparing the Vegetables Rinse the carrots and potatoes in cold water.  Cut the carrots into manageable rounds. Cut a 1/2 cup or more of carrots, depending on how much is going to be served to each person. Try having a 1/3 cup of carrot rounds per person. To prevent the carrot rounds from breaking apart or flying away while cutting them, boil the tall carrots with their tops cut off for 2 minutes on low-medium heat. Avoid leaving the carrots on for too long as they\u2019ll be added to the broth later and may turn out to be too soft or mushy. Peel the potatoes. They do not have to be cut. These can be left whole if desired. Boil water in a medium saucepan. Add a pinch of salt after seeing the first few bubbles form on the bottom. Add the vegetables to the water. Let them boil on the medium-high setting for 15-20 minutes. Cooking the Meat Set a high-walled frying pan with oil to warm on the stovetop on medium-high heat. The oil should be spreading on warm heat, but not popping. If it\u2019s smoking or sizzling, turn down the heat. Defrost and warm the chuck roasts. The chuck roasts can be fresh or frozen. The chuck roasts can be submerged while in their packaging in cold tap water. Do not let the meat reach 40 \u00b0F (4 \u00b0C) as this is considered the \u201cdanger zone\u201d for bacteria formation. Do not let water touch the chuck roasts (this goes for any meat) as it may become watery and bacteria-ridden. The chuck roasts can be defrosted in the microwave but will have to be used immediately afterwards as the temperature increase will result in faster bacteria formation and may cook a little while in the microwave. Cut the chuck roasts into 1/4-inch thick strips and add them into the pan; turn on the medium-high heat setting if it isn\u2019t on already. The meat may sizzle or smoke at first but will stop after aji-mirin and soy sauce is added to the frying pan. Avoid overcrowding the pan with meat as it will not cook evenly. Pour in 1 tablespoon of aji-mirin and 1/2 cup of soy sauce for every 2 1/4-inch thick strips beef added. Some of the aji-mirin will be absorbed into the beef strips while cooking. Season and flip the beef strips evenly. Turn the heat down as the strips get closer to being finished. This should take 5-7 minutes on medium heat depending on the heat setting. Add more oil if the meat starts sticking to the pan. Add a teaspoon of salt and a pinch of meat seasoning to the beef and vegetables as you gradually turn the heat down.  Serving Nikujaga Take out separate bowls for each serving.  Add the 3-5 strips of meat into each bowl and spoon in the 2 or more types of vegetables depending on the portion size. The broth left over from the vegetables can be spooned in for more flavor. Keep it hot or warm for the best results.",
