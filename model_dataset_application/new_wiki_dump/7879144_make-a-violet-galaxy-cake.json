  "text":" Preparing the Batter Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C).  Add the four sticks of butter, the granulated sugar, and the seven eggs in a mixing bowl. Mix together using a beater. Mix together the baking powder, salt, and flour together in another mixing bowl. This time, use a mixing spoon. Mix together 1.5 cups of whole milk and the vanilla in a small mixing bowl. Use a mixing spoon. Add and mix in the two separate mixtures to the main mixing bowl, using a beater.  Separate the combined batter into three smaller bowls. This prepares the batter for coloring.But leave about 2 cups of batter without coloring. Add the colors to each bowl of batter. Add in royal blue food coloring to the first bowl. Add teal food coloring to the second bowl. Add only 1 tablespoon of the violet food coloring in the last bowl. Mix the food colorings into the batters. Mix until each batter is evenly colored throughout. Baking the Cakes Add batter to the first cake pan. Scoop in a bit of batter from each of the differently colored batters in random color order, dotting the batter around the pan or swirling a stick around the pan. This forms the variegated coloring that makes this cake special. Be sure to cover right across the base of the pan and to provide sufficient batter to create the first cake layer. Use the back of a spoon to smooth each color blob into its neighboring color blob, to ensure that all of the batter is connected. Do the same for the two other pans. Ensure that each pan has the same amount of batter overall. You're aiming to make three evenly sized layers to form the cake as a whole. Bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius) for 25 to 30 minutes.  Making the Frosting Make the frosting. Beat the powdered sugar, cream cheese, and the two sticks of butter in a mixing bowl. Add 3 teaspoons of milk and a tablespoon of violet food coloring. This will create the galaxy coloring for the frosting. Assembling the Cake Take the three cakes out of the oven when done. To test that the cake is done, insert a toothpick or skewer into the cake; if it comes out clean, the cake is cooked. Cut the top of the cake so you would have a smooth layer of cake. Frost the top of the first cake. This acts as filling and will allow the next cake layer to affix to it. Place the second cake on top of the first cake. Once again, frost the top of this cake, serving as filling and for affixing the final layer. Do the same with the third cake, placing it on top of the frosted second layer.  Frost the sides of the whole cake. Ensure that the whole cake is covered evenly. Serve. Once the frosting has in place and set, the cake can be served. If waiting for a couple of hours, keep in a cool, dry place until serving time. If storing, keep in an airtight cake container.",
