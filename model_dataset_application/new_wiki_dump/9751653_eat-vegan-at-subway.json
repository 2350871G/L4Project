This makes it an ideal choice for strict vegans whose diets don\u2019t include sweeteners processed by animals or containing animal byproducts. If you order \u201cwhite\u201d bread at Subway, your sandwich will be made with Italian bread. All Subway sandwiches are available in 6\u201d or 12\u201d sizes."

          "description":"The 9-Grain Wheat is another responsible option, assuming you have no problem with honey. It contains more healthy whole grains than the Italian bread, and can lend rich, earthy notes to your sandwich. Since the 9-Grain Wheat bread is slightly sweet, it can be a good way to balance out sandwiches filled with savory ingredients."

          "description":"Subway\u2019s tasty Sourdough and Roasted Garlic breads are both vegan-approved, which is good news for bread lovers looking for something a little different. The only downside is that they\u2019re not available at all stores, so you might not be able to make them one of your go-to choices. Some Subway restaurants may sell Sourdough and Roasted Garlic bread as part of a limited-time promotional special."

Wraps have fewer carbs and calories than bread and are easy to eat on the go."

Some restaurants also offer items like avocado, carrots, beetroot and sweet peppers, as well. For a quick and easy meal, ask for a Veggie Delite sandwich on Italian or 9-Grain Wheat bread. The Veggie Delite is totally meat-free, so ordering it will be easier than listing every component you want individually to your sandwich artist."

A couple of these patties can provide a little extra substance if you don\u2019t feel like chowing down on vegetables alone. Subway\u2019s Malibu Garden Patties are made with a flavorful mixture of finely-diced vegetables, fresh herbs, and whole grains. Some outlets serve patties named other things, ask about vegan options in store. If you\u2019re not sure whether your Subway location carries Malibu Garden Patties, call and check with them ahead of time. Don\u2019t get the Malibu Garden Patties confused with the Vegimax Patties, which use eggs and milk as a binding agent."

Not only that, but it\u2019s full of hearty-healthy monounsaturated fats, making it as nutritious as it is delicious. There will typically be an extra charge for adding guacamole to your sandwich."

Just be sure to avoid flavored varieties, which often contain cheese and other dairy products. Making your chips part of a combo meal along with a small drink is usually cheaper than purchasing them separately."

A serving of black bean soup has only 210 calories and a single gram of fat, which can make it an attractive alternative to chips if you also happen to be counting calories. Soups tend vary by season or location, but the Low-Fat Black Bean Soup is a staple of many Subway restaurant menus. As of 2018, soups are only no longer being offered at all Subway locations, so have a backup side in mind."

Having a bag of apples with your sandwich is a good way to reduce the number of calories you\u2019re consuming while also making sure you get your fruits and vegetables for the day. Subway\u2019s packaged apple slices contains a mixture of red and green apples."
