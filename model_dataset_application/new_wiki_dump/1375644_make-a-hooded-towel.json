  "text":" Making the hood Purchase a large bath towel and a hand towel in coordinating colors. Cheap, thin towels are easier to work with than thick, luxury towels. They also come in many different colors and patterns that might be appealing to kids. Plan ahead. If you plan on making a super hero themed towel, base the towel on the super hero's cloak. For example, a Batman towel would be black or dark blue/purple, while a Superman towel would be red. Cut a hand towel in half horizontally so that you end up with two squares. Fold the towel in half first, then cut it along the fold; this will give you a nice, straight edge. You will only be using one of these squares, so discard the other one or save it for another project. Fold the hand towel in half, and sew along the cut edge using a \u00bd-inch (1.27 centimeters) seam allowance. Use sewing pins to keep the edges in place, and remove the pins when you are done. Towels don't fray much, so you do not need to finish the hem. If you'd like to finish the seam, use a zigzag stitch along the edge. Turn the hood inside out.

Try to get at close to the edge as possible. You can also use a heat-and-bond tape instead. Adding Animal Ears Consider adding some animal ears to the hood. This is completely optional, but it can add a fun look to the hooded towel. If you do not wish to add animal ears, skip down to the next part. Cut four large triangles or half circles out of the extra hand towel half. Cut the ears 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) bigger than you want them to be to allow for seam allowances. You can also use a different colored towel for the inside of the ears instead. Sew along the angled/curved edges using a \u00bd-inch (1.27 centimeters) seam allowance, then turn them inside out. If your ears are triangle shaped, clip the top points of the animal ears before turning them inside out. This will reduce bulk. Cut two slits on the top of the hood. Position the slits about 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) from the edge. They can be as close together or as far apart as you'd like, but 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) from the top seam you sewed is a good rule of thumb. The slits should be the same width as the base of your animal ears. Slide the ears by \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) into each slit and pin in place. Make sure that the ears are sticking out of the top of the hood, and the bases are on the inside. Sew the ears down from the inside of the hood using a \u00bd-inch (1.27 centimeters) seam allowance. Remove the pins when you are done, and trim off any loose threads. Assembling the Hooded Towel Spread the bath towel out horizontally, find the midpoint along the top edge, and mark it with a pin. The easiest way to do this is to fold the towel in half, and place a pin along the top of the fold. Unfold the towel when you are done. You may also want to find the midpoint of the hood as well; mark it along the bottom hem with a pin. Position the hood above the bath towel, and overlap the two edges by \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters). Place the hood above the bath towel. Align the midpoints, and overlap the bottom hem of the hood with the top edge of the bath towel, making sure that the hood is on top. Secure the two towels with pins.
