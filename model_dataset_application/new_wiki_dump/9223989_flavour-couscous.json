Israeli couscous, which has larger granules, is especially good for picking up flavors and adding texture. While couscous looks and cooks like a grain, it is actually more of a pasta. Look for whole grain couscous to get more fiber and add some nutty flavors to your dish."

          "description":"Add a tablespoon of olive oil or a nut oil like pistachio or almond oil per cup of couscous. Toast the pasta on a medium-high heat for three to five minutes, until it is a light golden brown. This brings out some of the natural flavors and aromas in the pasta. Have your water or stock boiling in a separate pot before you start toasting. Couscous should go straight from the pan into a boiling liquid."

          "description":"Couscous will cook in water, but it tastes even better in a stock or broth. You want a little more liquid than is necessary to completely cover the couscous. This equates roughly to one and a quarter cups of broth or stock per cup of couscous. Chicken and vegetable broth both work wonderfully with couscous. They will add flavor and a bit of salt to your recipe without overwhelming other flavors. A broth made from bullion will work, but it will be saltier than a fresh broth. Avoid adding additional salt to a recipe made with bullion."

If you plan to serve your couscous with meat, a squeeze of fresh lemon juice will do the trick. Other useful acids to serve in couscous include:\nAbout a quarter of a cup of white wine per cup of water\nA few tablespoons of white vinegar to cut salt without adding too much flavor\nA few tablespoons of balsamic or red wine vinegar for Mediterranean dishes\nA squeeze of lime juice for Southwestern sides or dishes that will include other fruit"

Add a clove or two of chopped up garlic per cup of couscous while the pasta is cooking to bring a mild, well-balanced flavor to your dish. You can also add:\nWhite onions for a stronger taste\nShallots for a balanced savory and sweet flavor\nLeeks for a more mellow flavor, especially if you plan on adding fruit or herbs later"

Add in a handful of fresh herbs after your couscous has absorbed all its water but before you fluff it. Some herbs that pair well with couscous include:\nMint for Middle Eastern inspired dishes\nDill for dishes with a mild flavor, or those being served with fish\nRosemary to brighten up a heavy dish\nOregano to add depth to a light dish\nBasil for any Mediterranean or pilaf style dish"

That, in turn, makes it easier to taste the flavor you have added. Once your couscous has cooked completely, take a fork and gently break about the grains. Do this until there are no large clumps left."

The juices from the meat will absorb into the couscous, and the flavors added into the pasta while cooking will complement the meat. If you are a vegetarian, adding a roasted portobello mushroom is a great way to top couscous. You could also skip the meat entirely and add handfuls of fresh veggies."

Couscous is perfect for a grain salad, and it hold up against both sweet and savory. Bell peppers, cucumber, zucchini, and chopped spinach are all commonly seen in couscous dishes. You could also try produce like:\nApples, which work well in dishes with sausage\nDried apricots in Mediterranean or Middle Eastern inspired dishes\nStrawberries, which pair well with both balsamic vinegar and basil\nAny grilled vegetables to add a smoky flavor\nCherry tomatoes, which can help balance a salty dish\nSnap peas or celery for a fresh touch"

          "description":"Too much cheese can overwhelm the other flavors you put in your couscous, but a little bit can enhance the work you\u2019ve put in. Melt a handful of fresh grated Parmesan to a cup of couscous for a creamy, savory side. You can also add feta to give your couscous a bit of a bite."

Pine nuts, dried cherries, dried cranberries, pomegranate seeds, shaved Parmesan or Romano cheese, or sun-dried tomatoes all make excellent toppers. Pick one topping and add a small amount to your dish. These are all powerful flavors, so one serving size should be enough per cup of couscous."
