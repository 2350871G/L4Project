          "description":"Use about 1/2 tsp (3 g) of salt and 1/2 tsp (1 g) of ground black pepper to season your chicken thighs. If you'd like to add any other seasonings, like your favorite herbs or spices, add them at this time as well. #*If you're leaving the skin on the chicken, place a small pat of butter between the skin and the meat. You'll need about 1 tbsp (14 g) of butter for all 4 thighs. For example, you might season the chicken thighs with 1/8 tsp (0.2 g) of paprika and 1/8 tsp (.8 g) of garlic powder in addition to the salt and pepper. If you're using an ingredient that contains salt, like Cajun seasoning or garlic salt, adjust the amount of table salt you use in the recipe."

Make sure you refrigerate the thighs while they sit. Never let raw chicken sit out at room temperature, as this can lead to the growth of dangerous bacteria."

Use a grill brush to clean off the grill grates before cooking chicken. This will help prevent the chicken from sticking. Tip: If you're using a charcoal grill, light the charcoal, then close the grill and let it heat up for 10-15 minutes. If you're using a gas grill, light the grill with the push-button ignition or with a long match, then let the grill heat up for about 5 minutes."

This will make much less of a mess as well. Use a sauce brush to coat the entire chicken thigh with sauce. You can add sauce to the chicken while it is still grilling if you brush it on about 10 minutes before you are going to take it off of the grill. Be careful if you are using a gas grill because dripping sauce might cause damage to the heat source. Barbecue and teriyaki are the most popular sauces for grilled chicken thighs, but there are several other great choices. Honey mustard, buffalo, and lemon-herb are some other sauces that are popular with grilled chicken.Tip: You can buy a pre-made sauce at the store or you can try making your own teriyaki or barbecue sauces!"

If you made some barbecue grilled thighs, add a zest of lemon or serve with a pickle on the side. Grilled teriyaki chicken goes great with some fresh basil and green onion. If you want your teriyaki more Hawaiian themed, serve it with some pineapple rings. Serve up your spicy buffalo chicken with some raw celery and carrots. Ranch dressing and blue cheese is also a popular side for buffalo chicken. Lemon-herb grilled chicken tastes great with arugula and some fresh rosemary."
