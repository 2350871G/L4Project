Looking straight up, facing south, you'll notice three bright stars to your left (the east). These stars are Vega, Altair and Deneb. They form a large asterism known as the Summer Triangle."

If you follow an invisible line from the two stars opposite the handle (the \"pointers\"), you'll find that they point almost directly towards Polaris, the North Star, which is at the end of the handle of the Little Dipper, another asterism. This is actually Ursa Minor, the Little Bear."
