Soak it until the ground is fully saturated and the water is ponding, and then keep going a bit longer. Ant hills can be 3 ft (0.91 m) deep, so you need to use a lot of water to flood the tunnels all the way to the bottom."

          "description":"Check back on the hill 2 or 3 times per day. If you don\u2019t see any activity after 3 days, the ants are probably all dead. Otherwise, either repeat the flooding or move on to other measures."

Boil a large pot of water on the stove, then very carefully transport it out to the ant hill. Slowly, steadily, and carefully pour it into the main opening of the ant hill. You may have better results if you boil 2-3 pots of water simultaneously, then pour them one after the other into the ant hill. The more water, the better! Check after a couple hours and over the next few days. If the ants are still alive, repeat the process or try something else."

Pour the boiling soapy water into the ant hill, check for signs of life, and repeat as needed. While there isn\u2019t clear scientific evidence to support it, it\u2019s possible that adding soap will coat the ants in a slippery sheen that will make it impossible for them to function properly. This, mixed with the torrent of boiling water, may just do the trick!"

The more vinegar you use the better, so consider dumping 1 US gal (3.8 L) jugs of vinegar into the hill opening daily for 3 days. You may have even more success if you pour several scoops of baking soda into the hole first. The volcano-like foaming action caused by the combination of vinegar and baking soda may push the mixture deeper into the ant hill\u2019s tunnels. It also looks cool erupting out of the ant hill!"

Instead, it will soak up the moisture inside them and expand until it kills them. There isn\u2019t a lot of scientific evidence to support either of these, but lots of people swear by one or the other. Also, they\u2019re not harmful to your lawn or pets."

Pour the mixture around the perimeter of the hill and on top of it as well. Repeat this daily for at least 3 days. Ants supposedly hate the scent of citrus oils, so the hope here is that they\u2019ll be so upset with the citrusy goop that they\u2019ll move somewhere else. Support for this method is primarily anecdotal rather than scientific."

The tiny, sharp granules are uncomfortable or even dangerous for ants to walk on, and if they eat any of it, it will cause fatal internal injuries. Diatomaceous earth will irritate your skin and can cause quite a bit of discomfort if it gets into your eyes or breathing passages. Only apply it on a wind-free day, and consider wearing eye and breathing protection when using it."

Boric acid is toxic to ants if they consume it, so the hope here is that the workers will bring it back for the other ants\u2014including the queen\u2014to eat. However, boric acid will also kill any grass in the immediate area, and it is also dangerous to use if pets or kids frequent the area."

Place them around the perimeter of the ant hill, and the worker ants will enter, take the poisoned food into the colony, and kill most if not all of the ants inside. Enclosed bait traps make it harder for pets or kids to access the poison, but they aren\u2019t completely foolproof. Supervise any pets or kids closely or, better yet, keep them out of the area.
