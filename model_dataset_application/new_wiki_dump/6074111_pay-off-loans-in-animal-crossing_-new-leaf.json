One of the easiest ways to make money is by selling fish and bugs to Reese at the Re-Tail Shop, which can be found by locating the pink recycling icon on the map at the bottom screen. To catch fish, get a fishing rod at the Nookling Junction on Main Street. Open your inventory while standing in front of a body of water (either a river, pond or ocean), and equip the fishing rod by dragging it over to your character. When you see a shadow moving below the water's surface, hit the \u201cA\u201d button to cast your bait. Wait until the fish approaches your bait, and you hear a dripping sound.

To catch bugs, first get a bug net at the Nookling Junction. If you find a bug, sneak up on them by gently pressing the analog stick forward. Equip the net by opening your inventory and dragging it to your character, then hit the \u201cA\u201d button when you are 3-4 steps away from the bug to capture it. The most valuable fish and bugs can be found on the island at night, from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. If you have not already unlocked the island, you must pay 10,000 bells to Tom Nook to transform your tent into a home. Afterwards, talk to Tortimer on the docks and wait a day for Kapp'n to appear with the boat. While some fish and bugs are only worth about 500 bells each, others can be worth up to 32,000 bells. If you have already caught some things for Reese, enter the shop, and hit the \u201cA\u201d button to talk with her. Select the \u201cI want to sell\u201d option, and select items from your inventory (you can select multiple items by tapping them with the stylus), then hit the \u201cDone\u201d button at the bottom of the screen to finish your selection."
