You\u2019ll need:\nA good vacuum with a hose attachment. A brush head can also help you break up caked on dirt. A thin cleaning brush or an old toothbrush. You can also purchase special window track cleaning brushes. These brushes are designed with a special brush head that\u2019s made to get all those hard to reach corners in the window track. A clean bucket of warm or hot water. Add a few drops of dish soap or Dawn Soap until you see foamy bubbles. One towel to dip into your water and one dry towel to wipe up any leftover moisture. You may also want to grab baking soda and vinegar, or hydrogen peroxide to help you break down any tough dirt or mold. You\u2019ll need q-tips as well to loosen the dirt."

The toothbrush should get most of the muck off the tracks. Use cotton swabs to clean out tight areas like the corners.
