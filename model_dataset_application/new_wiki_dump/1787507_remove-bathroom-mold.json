          "description":"White vinegar is a great way to remove mold from a variety of different surfaces. Pour the vinegar directly into a spray bottle to use it. It doesn\u2019t need to be diluted at all, as it is the most effective when it isn\u2019t watered down. You don\u2019t need to rinse away the vinegar after you have used it. Although the smell can be unpleasant, it usually clears within 1-2 hours. You can open a window or turn on a fan to help the smell disappear faster.

Ilya founded NW Maids in 2014, with an emphasis on upfront pricing, easy online booking, and thorough cleaning services. Ilya Ornatov\t\t\tCleaning Guru & Founder, NW Maids\t\t\t\tExpert Trick: If you need to treat a large area, or if you don't want your bathroom to have a pungent vinegar scent, you can dilute the vinegar with water in a 2:1 ratio. This will give you more solution to spray and cut the smell without lowering the anti-fungal power of vinegar!"

          "headline":"Use a Borax solution for a natural mold remover.",
          "description":"Borax is a natural insecticide and fungicide. Mix together 1 cup (204 g) of Borax with 1 US gal (3.8 L)of water and then pour the solution into a spray bottle. Simply spray the solution directly on the surface you want to clean. Borax doesn\u2019t need to be rinsed off, as it can prevent more mold from growing in the future. You can find Borax in the laundry section of grocery stores. It is a white mineral powder. Borax is dangerous to consume, but unlike bleach, it doesn't release toxic fumes."

          "description":"Although bleach is effective at killing mold on non-porous surfaces such as showers, basins, and tiles, it is a toxic substance and needs to be used carefully. Create a bleach solution with 1 part bleach to 10 parts water and place this into a spray bottle. You don\u2019t need to rinse the bleach solution away afterward unless pets or small children might touch the surface. Always wear gloves when working with bleach and keep the area well-ventilated to avoid inhaling the fumes. Bleach can cause eye, lung, and skin irritations."

Use a new side of the cloth whenever the first side gets saturated or too dirty. You may need to swap cleaning cloths throughout the process, especially if you are cleaning a large area.
