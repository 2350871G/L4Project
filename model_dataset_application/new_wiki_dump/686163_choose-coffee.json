Coffee should be used within a month of the roast date, so buy coffee that's been roasted within the past month. In general, the more recent the roast date, the better.

A high-quality coffee label will include information about how the coffee was roasted, the date the beans were harvested, recommended brewing temperatures, and the elevation the beans were grown at. You don't necessarily have to dissect all this information, as it's mostly meaningful to coffee experts. However, the presence of the information alone indicates quality."

If coffee has a Fair Trade Certified label and a Rainforest Alliance certification, it indicates the coffee was farmed in an ethical, environmentally conscious fashion and was traded fairly. Specialty coffee roasters typically prefer Direct Trade to Fair Trade because it doesn't necessarily encourage quality products if beans have a 'going rate.' Direct Trade ensures that formers who producer higher-quality products are compensated properly. If it's important for you to you to find coffee that was not exposed to pesticides, look for an organic label as well. This indicates coffee was grown without synthetic fertilizers and industrial pesticides."

You can also buy decaf coffee if you like the flavor, but do not want the caffeine content. Coffee usually has anywhere between 65 to 100 milligrams of caffeine per cup. Stronger coffee would be on the higher end of this spectrum, while weaker coffee would be on the lower end."
