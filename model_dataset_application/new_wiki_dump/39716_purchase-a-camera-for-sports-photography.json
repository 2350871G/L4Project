For sports photography, you usually want a telephoto zoom lens that goes to 200mm or greater. Depending on where you will be shooting, you may require a \"faster\" lens (i.e. one with a low f stop number, usually 2.8 or lower). This allows the camera to take in as much light as possible to get the recommended shutter speed of 1/1000 of a second to really shoot the fast action."
