          "description":"Dahlia is a large plant family, and you\u2019ll need to decide which size of plant will best suit your growing space. Unlike other popular flowers, dahlias come in three main categories: large (including the popular \u201cDinnerplate\u201d variety), medium, and small. The size of both the blossoms and the overall plant will vary depending on which type you choose. Dahlia flowers also come in a wide array of colors, including white, yellow, orange, pink, purple, blue, red, or multi-colored. Large dahlias can grow from 3\u20134 feet (1\u20131.2 meters) tall. Medium dahlias (also known as border dahlias) will reach between 1\u20132 feet (0.3\u20130.6 meters) in height. Small dahlias will only reach between 10\u201320 inches (25\u201350 cm) in height."

Due to the variety and diversity among types of dahlias, be sure to ask the sales staff for assistance, or read the label on the package carefully. They\u2019ll be able to help you determine which tubers will produce the size and color of blossoms you are looking for. If you live in a remote location and do not have access to a nearby plant nursery, you can purchase the dahlia tubers online instead. Check the websites for major online plant retailers including Eden Brothers, Dahlia Barn, Dahlias.com, or Harris Seeds."

          "headline":"Decide where to plant your dahlias based on your climate zone.",
          "description":"Dahlias can be grown in many climates, but the tubers will need to be kept indoors during the winter in colder areas. Dahlias thrive in warm, sunny climates, and will survive the winter as tubers in zones 8 and 9. If you live in the United States, this means that dahlias will not survive the winter if you live north of Kansas and east of western Idaho. If you live in zones 1\u20136, you will need to plant your dahlias in a greenhouse or at least store your dahlia tubers inside during the winter. Dahlias don\u2019t do well in long, hot summers, so if you live in zone 10, you may need to cover outdoor dahlias or bring them indoors in summer. If you live in zone 7, dahlias may be able to survive an outdoor winter if you insulate the soil over the tubers with a thick layer of dry mulch."

If you have a thermometer that can be used to measure ground temperature, that can guide your planting time. Do not plant the dahlias if the ground temperature is below 60\u00b0F (16\u00b0C), or the dahlias may not grow. If you plant the dahlias too early (e.g. in March or April) and another frost comes, the tubers will die."

Dahlias also need to be protected from the wind, so plant them in a protected area. Their large flowers can become heavy when mature, and can snap off in a stiff breeze."

If you already have a garden or a section of your yard with well-drained soil, plant your dahlias there. If you\u2019re concerned that the soil may not drain well, add sand to your soil to improve your garden\u2019s drainage. Do this at the same time that you\u2019re adding the compost or manure. If your soil is clay heavy, work peat moss or compost into the soil to loosen it. This can make it easier to plant dahlias."

Adding fully rotted compost or another fertilizer type to the soil will encourage the plants to grow well and bloom quickly."

When digging the holes, leave enough space between the plants that growing dahlias will not choke one another or steal nutrients from one another. For smaller varieties, leave 2 feet (0.61 m) between holes. For medium or giant dahlias, leave 2 to 3 feet (0.61 to 0.91 m) between holes."

Scoop a small handful of compost and bone meal into each of the holes, and add a small scoop of dry fertilizer. You can purchase ground bone meal at a local plant nursery or gardening center. If you do not already own compost and fertilizer, you can purchase them from a large gardening center or from a landscaping outlet."

Be sure the growing point of the tuber faces upward before you cover it with soil. Wait until you see new growth above the soil before you water the dahlias.

Wait until you can see sprouts above the soil, and then water the dahlias only in the morning. This will prevent the water from evaporating if you live in a hot zone. It\u2019s not necessary to water the dahlias every day. Keep an eye on the plants and, when they begin to look a little wilted, water them generously. In general, it is best to water dahlias 2-3 times a week during the hottest part of the summer."

Continue by fertilizing the plants about once each month until August. You can purchase low-nitrogen liquid fertilizer at a local garden center or plant nursery. It may even be available at a supermarket. Look for a 5-10-10 or 10-20-20 mixture."

Prevent these plants from falling over by tying them to stakes shortly after they begin to grow. You can use a thin piece of regular string or twine to fasten the stem to the stake. You can use a plain wooden stake or dowel to secure the dahlias. If you\u2019d rather have a more decorative garden, purchase a cylindrical tomato cage and let the dahlia use it as a support."

This is known as the terminal bud and will produce a very large flower if the other buds are removed. If you\u2019re not concerned with producing large, impressive flowers (of the type that would be entered in a flower competition), you don\u2019t need to disbud the plant.

Wait until the foliage turns black after the first frost in late fall or early winter, then cut the plant back to just 2-4 inches (5-10 cm) of growth above the ground. Dig up the tubers and let them dry out for a few days. Then place them in a ventilated box or basket filled with peat moss or vermiculite. Store your tubers in an area where temperatures will remain between 45\u00b0 and 55\u00b0 F (7\u00b0-13\u00b0 C)."
