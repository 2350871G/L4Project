Red roses tend to have a pear-like shape. Roses usually have one flower per branch and tend to have thorns or prickly textures on the stem.

They should be planted in an area where the soil's pH level is between 6.5 and 7 and where they can have access to direct sunlight six to eight hours a day. You can buy a pH testing kit at a greenhouse to check your soil outdoors. If growing roses indoors, you should be able to buy soil at a greenhouse that is the proper pH for your roses.
