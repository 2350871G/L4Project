  "text":" Preparing the Surface Area Being Restored Prepare the Restoration area. Use painter\u2019s tape to seal off all decorative logos, letters, decals, insignias, intersecting grains, countertops, or frames that are in close proximity to the restoration area. Attach a pad to the grip handle. Place the chosen pad on a clean flat surface (review chart, Pad Abrasiveness and Usage. [Do not use grip handle with 1\u201d x 6\u201d Coarse Finger Strip] Place grip handle in middle of pad. Pull up one of the two clip levers to open side clamps. Tuck one end of pad under clamps. Slowly and carefully lower clip lever to lock pad securely into place. Keep your fingers away from the clamps. Letting go of clip lever prematurely may result in injury.) Slowly release clamp to lock position. Repeat on other side of handle. Pad is secured when stretched tightly along grip base. The Grip handle can be used horizontally or vertically as long as your pad strokes follow the direction of the grain. Shake bottle well. Apply small amount to pad in an \u201cS\u201d pattern. Keep just enough ULTRA SHINE on pad to maintain cutting effectiveness during restoration process. ULTRA SHINE leaves surfaces dry to the touch upon wiping. Do not use ULTRA SHINE on 1\u201d x 6\u201d Finger Strip. Tightly secure bottle cap on unused ULTRA SHINE and store in a cool dry place. Applying Scratch-B-Gone to the Surface Treated Attach Gray Finishing Pad securely to grip handle  Apply small amount of ULTRA SHINE in an \u201cS\u201d pattern over pad.  Place pad onto surface and begin pad strokes in direction of grain. Use light pressure and increase as needed for 8-10 strokes. STOP. Check your results by wiping the surface clean with micro-fiber cloth in the direction of the grain.  If evidence of the damage is still visible, repeat Steps 3-4 above for only a few more attempts, then STOP.  If damage is still visible, switch to the Brown Reconditioning Pad. Once the Brown Pad is securely attached to the grip handle, repeat Steps 2-4 above.

CAUTION: Overusing the Gray Finishing Pad can cause burnishing, characterized by a shiny surface. If this occurs, switch to the Brown Reconditioning Pad to re-etch the grain pattern. Then go to Final Surface Blending. Blending the Surface for a Finished Uniform Look Start the final processes. The restoration area should now have several newly-etched scratches going in the direction of the grain. No visible signs should exist of the original damage. It\u2019s time now to blend the newly-restored metal to its surrounding area. Attach gray pad to grip handle and apply ULTRA SHINE as directed.  Gradually move pad back and forth going with the grain to an increasingly larger area while decreasing pressure to a light touch. This properly blends the newly reconditioned metal with the surrounding metal to erase the surface damage. Inspect area every 8-10 strokes then STOP.  Wipe surface with micro-fiber cloth in grain direction.  Repeat until you are satisfied with results. Some areas may require larger adjacent areas be blended well to ensure a uniform look. Treating Deep Scratches and Gouges Begin the restoration process by using the 1\u201d x 6\u201d Finger Strip.  Do not use ULTRA SHINE on surface area or Finger Strip. Place strip over tip of index finger and hold in place with your free hand. Using the finger strip, dry rub the scratch following the grain direction. Continue for 8-10 strokes increasing pressure as needed then STOP. Inspect area by wiping it clean with a micro-fiber cloth in the grain direction. For deep gouges, it may be necessary to apply additional pressure for a longer period of time. You are cutting a new grain channel. Repeat Steps until the original scratch is no longer visible.  Affix the Burgundy Coarse Foam-backed Pad to grip handle with foam side of grip handle against foam side of pad.  Apply ULTRA SHINE to the course side of the pad as directed above.  Place pad onto surface and begin pad strokes in the direction of the grain.  Use light pressure and increase as needed for 8-10 strokes, then STOP. Check results by wiping surface clean with micro-fiber cloth in grain direction Repeat until all visible traces of the scratch or gouge are gone. At this stage, the restoration area should appear to have several newly re-etched scratches going in the direction of the grain. No visible signs of the original cross-pattern scratch should exist. Proceed to Final Surface Blending.",
