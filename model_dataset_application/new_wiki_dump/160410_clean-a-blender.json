The polident should clear up any tough stains. If you don't want to remove the blades, you can always just clean them in the carafe. Pour in enough hot water to cover the blades, and then drop in two tablets of polident. Let soak for at least half an hour. Polident is a commercial tooth-whitening and antibacterial agent.
