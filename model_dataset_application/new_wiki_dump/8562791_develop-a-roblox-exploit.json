While not completely necessary, using a debugger may help you in diagnosing issues in either Roblox's code or your very own exploits. If you purchased (or plan to purchase) IDA Pro, then you don't have to obtain a debugger as it already comes with one (the IDA debugger). Else, you can obtain a free debugger from the Internet, such as OllyDbg. Alternatively, if you have Cheat Engine (a popular cheating tool for video games), then you could also use its debugging features, albeit they're known for their instability."
