If you sell (on average) 20 jars a week, that\u2019s a total profit of $30.00 per week.

Don\u2019t use font colors that are similar to the background color (e.g., bright red text on a maroon background). Make your product\u2019s packaging stand out from the competition. Create interesting packaging that complements the product and reflects the values of your business. For example, if you\u2019re selling all-natural products, you might want to use compostable or biodegradable packaging with earthy colors (like green and brown).Take the cost of packaging into consideration when calculating your total expenses. Make sure the packaging is appropriate to the product. For instance, if you\u2019re selling muffins, make sure they\u2019re in a sturdy container so they don\u2019t get smashed during shipping. Consider the weight of the packaging\u2014heavier items will cost more to ship than lighter ones. Disclose all of the ingredients on your packaging. Customers turn to the ingredients lists to know exactly what they\u2019re eating, which is crucial if they have particular allergies or other dietary restrictions. List the largest quantity ingredients first and go down from there (i.e., if your product is mainly made up of wheat flour, list that first). Highlight food allergens in bold font or in a separate statement (or both).For example, you might write \u201cAllergens: Wheat, eggs, peanuts\u201d in bold font under the ingredients list. If you have a website, you\u2019ll need to put the ingredients on there as well. That way, customers won\u2019t have to ask you questions about particular ingredients. State the net quantity and the combined weight of the product. Tell your customers how much of the product they\u2019re getting. Use ounces and milliliters for liquid products and grams and ounces for solids. If applicable, state how many items are in a single package (e.g., \u201c3 4-oz. cookies\u201d).If you\u2019re renting space in a commercial kitchen, they probably have kitchen scales for this purpose. If you\u2019re working from home, get a small kitchen scale to measure the weight in grams and ounces. If your product is liquid, take note of how many cups and ounces go into each bottle or jar and be consistent with your serving sizes. Mention the name and location of your company and the supplier. You need to state your name and location (city and state) in order to adhere to the FDA\u2019s Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. Telling customers where you are and, if applicable, the name(s) of your supplier(s) can also add to your marketing scheme.For instance, saying that your macaroons are made from organic free-range eggs on your own family farm might draw people who like to eat local goods, avoid animal cruelty, and support independent farms. If you\u2019re using a supplier, stating their name on the package will draw in more customers who already like their particular products. Give instructions on how to store and handle the product. If you\u2019re selling something that needs to be refrigerated right away or after opening, state that on the package. You can put it near the quantity and weight or close to the ingredients list. If necessary, state whether the product will go bad after a certain period of time (e.g., \u201cperishable\u201d) or if it should be handled with care (e.g., \u201cfragile\u201d).You might give an expiration date (\u201cUse by 10/6/20) or state how long the product is good after opening (e.g., \u201cUse within 7 days of opening\u201d). If your product requires reheating, give specific instructions on how to do that. You can send a small leaflet with the product or put it on the package. For instance: \u201cPreheat oven to 300\u00b0F (148\u00b0C). Wrap each muffin in foil. Place muffins on baking sheet. Wait 10 to 12 minutes. Enjoy!\u201d Selling Your Products Sell your products online via your own website. Luckily, there are tons of web builder sites made for small business owners to sell their goods\u2014no fancy internet lingo required. Set up your store via one of these sites. Or, if you want to increase your visibility on search engines, buy your own domain name from a legitimate registrar.A few popular web builder sites include Shopify, Weebly, and Wix. Start a blog where you offer an inside look at your business practices (like recipes and what inspired you to create your business) to draw in a following. Allow customers to sign up for newsletters via email so you can send them special offers, news about your business, and any other market materials. Just don\u2019t flood their inboxes! Post professional-looking photographs of your products. Hire a photographer to take photos of your products or use a quality camera (some smartphones have great resolution) to do it yourself. Use a spotlight lamp or natural light to make your photos clear and colorful.Take photos close up to show texture and true-to-life coloring. Lifestyle photography is a great way to show off your product. Show it being served in a way that reflects your company\u2019s core values. Pitch your product to established online retailers. Look for independent online grocers or specialty shops if your items are considered \u201cniche.\u201d You can also approach restaurants and other vendors about selling your items in their stores or via their online ordering system (if they have one).Keep in mind that they\u2019ll take a cut of the profits. Target retailers with your intended customers. For example, your vegan gluten-free cookies are more likely to sell from an online specialty foods vendor than they are a general grocer that sells mass-produced products. Take your total expenses into account when you price your items. Finding the proper price for your products can be tricky. Calculate the cost to make a single item (including ingredients, labeling, packing, shipping, and labor) and set a price that gives you a profit for each item sold. You can also price your items according to your competitor\u2019s prices, which is good to consider if your products will be on a shelf with similar items.For instance, if it takes $4.00 to make a single jar of pickles, selling them for $5.50 is going to give you a profit of $1.50 per jar sold. If you sell (on average) 20 jars a week, that\u2019s a total profit of $30.00 per week. Think about how much you, as a customer, would be willing to pay for your products\u2014keep the prices realistic and attractive. Use social media platforms to reach customers. Start a page for your business on Facebook, Instagram, and/or Twitter to market your products. Friends and family members can help spread the word by reposting your posts. You can also follow other online vendors that have a following similar to your own target audience.Keep all of your social media accounts consistent in terms of the color scheme, photos, and tone. Offer discounts and giveaways to followers for tagging their friends\u2014this will help reach more potential customers. Use sturdy boxes and cold packs to keep perishable items fresh while shipping. Shipping naturally takes time, but when it comes to perishable items it\u2019s best to ship them overnight. Meat and poultry items should be sent cold or frozen (below 40\u00b0F or 4\u00b0C) with a cold source inside the packaging. Foam or heavy corrugated cardboard are the best types of packaging for cold items.Make sure the shipping box says \u201cKeep Refrigerated\u201d on the outside so the customer knows they need to open it and refrigerate it as soon as possible. Pack your products in sturdy boxes that won\u2019t bend, break, or squish the food. Avoid sending packages at the end of the week so they don\u2019t end up sitting at a mailing facility over the weekend. Let your customers know that you only ship cold items at the beginning of the week.",
