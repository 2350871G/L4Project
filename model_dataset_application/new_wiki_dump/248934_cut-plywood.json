          "description":"To get a smooth cut on a sheet of plywood, you'll need to have the right blade. Look for a carbide-tipped blade with a high tooth count. You can find blades labeled for plywood or \"finished cuts,\" but make sure to check the tooth count. Blades come in various sizes, so be sure you get one that will fit your circular saw. If you stick with the blade that came with your saw, you'll likely end up with splintered ends, also known as tear-outs."

          "headline":"Set the saw blade to the right depth.",
          "description":"Before cutting your plywood, adjust your saw blade to the right depth. If your blade is set too deep, you'll be dragging a lot of excess blade through the sheet. If you have your blade set too shallow, you run the risk of not cutting all the way through the sheet. You want your saw to be about .25 inches (0.6 cm) below the sheet. If you're cutting a sheet of plywood that is .75 inches (1.9 cm) thick, set your blade to 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep."

          "headline":"Support the whole piece of wood.",
          "description":"When cutting a sheet of plywood, it's important that you support the sheet on both sides of the cut. A few long 2x4s laid across two sawhorses will keep the sheet steady as you cut. Keep the 2x4s handy just for this task, as you'll be cutting into the tops of them with your circular saw. If you don't have access to 2x4s or sawhorses, you can use a piece of rigid foam insulation instead. Lay the foam on the ground, and lay the sheet of plywood on top. Make sure the wood doesn't slide around on top of the foam board. If you use the foam board method, you can crawl across the board as you cut, and you don't have to worry about the board snapping off at the end of the cut."

When the teeth exit, they may cause some chipping. Placing the sheet with the good face down will ensure a smooth surface."

Use a utility knife to score your line before you cut. You may have to run your knife over the line a few times to get it to score completely. A good rule to follow is \"measure twice, cut once.\" If you cut the wood wrong, you can't do much to fix it other than start over with a new piece of wood."

          "headline":"Use a guide to cut.",
          "description":"Find a piece of plywood that still has its factory edge and attach it to your cutting surface using clamps. Take into consideration the width of the saw's base plate, or shoe. Adjust your guide so that the shoe fits firmly against the guide, and the blade is in line with your cut mark. If you are planning on cutting a lot of plywood, you might consider investing in a saw guide that attaches to your circular saw. Look online or in your local hardware store to find one that suits your needs."

Take care to make your cut as straight as possible. Using a saw is dangerous. Wear safety goggles at all times, and keep your fingers clear of the blade. Watch out for the power cord as you cut.

          "headline":"Choose the right blade.",
          "description":"To get the smoothest cut from your table saw, invest in a blade with a high tooth count, such as an 80 TPI plywood blade. Most stock blades on table saws work well for rough cuts, but will not give you a clean edge. Alternatively use a zero-clearance insert under the plywood. To make one of these, carefully set a piece of wood or plywood onto the working table saw, taking care not to have the wood slip or pull from your hands. Once the blade is all the way through (the blade needs to be quite high), clamp the insert down. You will be cutting on the insert, which does not allow the bottom layer of plywood to chip downward because of the low clearance between the blade and the insert. The insert is sacrificial and it's usually only sensible to make one when cutting large amounts of plywood."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Raise the blade.",
          "description":"Raising the blade changes the direction the teeth will enter the wood. When the blade is slightly raised, such that the teeth just barely cut through the surface, the teeth enter the cutting surface at an angle. If you raise the blade a little higher, you can get a perpendicular cut, which will make a smoother surface. Don't raise the blade more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the cutting surface. A raised blade may offer a smoother cut, but it also makes for a more dangerous cut. Exercise extreme caution when cutting with a raised blade."

A zero-clearance insert closes the gap and offers support to the sheet, making a smoother cut. You can purchase a zero-clearance throat plate online or at your local hardware store. Alternatively make your own. First, carefully set a piece of wood or plywood onto the working table saw, taking care not to have the wood slip or pull away from your hands.

          "description":"Large pieces of plywood can get heavy. When cutting them on a table saw, make sure you can keep it flat before beginning your cut. Stabilize the sheet on sawhorses, or ask a friend to help you hold it steady. Having the entire sheet supported allows you to keep a steady feed rate, that is, the speed you run the wood through the saw. You can also use a circular saw to break down large sheets to more manageable sizes."

Use the hand that is closest to the blade to press the sheet forward, through the blade. Use the hand that is furthest from the blade to press the sheet towards the cutline. As you get close to the end of the cut, move your hands so that you have one hand on either side of the blade. Carefully push the rest of the sheet through the blade.
