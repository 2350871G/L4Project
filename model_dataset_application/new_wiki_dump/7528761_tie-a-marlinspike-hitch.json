The actual knots are the exact same, but you should test each set with a vigorous pull to ensure they are all weight bearing. Note, however, that You must start from the bottom up. The final hitch you tie needs to be your top rung for the greatest strength and durability. Test the ladder every time you use it. Over time, all knots may lose some of their strength and start to become loose. Secure the rungs, especially the top ones, with clamps that prevent the rungs from falling off for longevity and added safety. Ensure that your rungs are as horizontal as possible, with evenly spaced rungs."
