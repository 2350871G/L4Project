      "description":"Decide whether you will trade spikes, the one black short, den betas, etc. Keep in mind, despite certain amounts of items being worth the same as each other, people may accept a trade based on what the items are. For example, 20 clothing betas is fair for a neon bow as it is worth the same thing as 10 den betas, but people would much rather prefer den betas to clothing betas. Between a black short and 10 den betas, people would obviously prefer the black short collar. Pick the item that someone will preferably accept rather than items you may not be able to get a neon bow with despite the worths being the same. Normally, people want a black short collar for a neon bow, so you may want to begin by trading for a black short. Considering how popular spikes are, this may be your best option, especially when it comes to spikes black in color as they are the rarest of all the groups of spikes (e.g. short wrists, long wrists, short collars, long collars). {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/bc\\/Screen-Shot-2020-01-19-at-8.49.55-AM.png\\/460px-Screen-Shot-2020-01-19-at-8.49.55-AM.png\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/bc\\/Screen-Shot-2020-01-19-at-8.49.55-AM.png\\/759px-Screen-Shot-2020-01-19-at-8.49.55-AM.png\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":272,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":448.9010989010989,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Fair_use\\\">Fair Use<\\/a> (screenshot)<br>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"

      "description":"The neon bow is worth 10 to 11 den betas, so start with that. If you don't already have that, save up for den betas. If you're non member, do adventures such as Return of the Phantoms and The Phantom Portal hard mode and collect small, good clothing betas. Then trade those clothing betas for den betas. Den betas are decent items to start with as they are often the base for trading for medium rares like spikes, neon bows, etc. Those spikes can then be traded for large items, such as party hats or founders' hats. Keep in mind that non member den betas are not worth two member den betas, contrary to popular belief. Non member den betas are worth 1 member den beta and a clothing beta. Avoid trading any more than that for a non member den beta. Trade for member den betas first and then trade a member den beta along with a clothing beta for a non member den beta, or trade 3 to 4 clothing betas directly for a non member den beta if you'd like. Continue this process until you have as many den betas as you need. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/ee\\/Screen-Shot-2020-01-19-at-8.55.55-AM.png\\/460px-Screen-Shot-2020-01-19-at-8.55.55-AM.png\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/ee\\/Screen-Shot-2020-01-19-at-8.55.55-AM.png\\/760px-Screen-Shot-2020-01-19-at-8.55.55-AM.png\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":273,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":450.989010989011,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Fair_use\\\">Fair Use<\\/a> (screenshot)<br>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nTo collect items faster from these land adventures, create 3 backup accounts to use along with your main account and you'll have the possibility to get 4 of a good item.

Technically, you'd only need to trade about 7 non member den betas for a black short, since each non member den beta is worth 1.5 member den betas, and 7 non member den betas would equal 10.5 member ones. However, people normally don't look at the worths of items and only the quantity, so if you're okay with overtrading 10 non member den betas, you can do that.

This may be inaccurate to you, since 2 good short collars is not the same worth as 11 den betas, but the worths of spikes are mutually exclusive. This means that in the rarity system, when it comes to spikes, the den beta worths of spikes don't matter when you're trading for rarer spikes. For example, 2 pink longs are worth 32 den betas, but a red long is worth either 2 pink longs or 23-25 den betas. This is just the way the rarity system is built. Because of this, a purple and red short collar would be worth about 14 to 16 den betas, more than what a neon bow is worth in den beta worth. If you're fine with trading more den betas for two spikes to have a higher chance of getting a black short or neon bow with them, you can do so.
