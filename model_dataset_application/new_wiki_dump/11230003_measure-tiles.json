  "text":" Measuring for a Square Area Clear the area to make it easier to take measurements. Before you take your measurements to calculate the total square footage of the room, you need to make sure the space is clear so nothing impedes your measurements. Move the furniture to the center and shoo out any pets that may get in your way. If you plan to measure a wall, take-down any paintings, posters, or anything else that could get in the way. Use a measuring tape to measure the length of the floor. If the room is a rectangular shape, measure the longer section with a tape measure.

Calculating for a Round Area Clear space in the center of the area. In order to calculate the total square footage of a round room or area, you need to be able to measure through the center of the room. Move any furniture, tables, or pets from the center so you can easily run a tape measure across it.Tip: If you can\u2019t clear the whole area, make sure you can run measuring tape through the center without it bending or folding over an object.

You\u2019ll need a little bit extra when you purchase your tiles anyway. For instance, if you have a radius of 10 feet (3.0 m), then your square footage would be 31.4 feet (9.6 m). Determining How Many Tiles You Need Multiply the square footage by 15% to account for the overage. You never want to buy just enough tile to cover the area. You may need extra tiles to fill in corners, or some of the tiles may break while you\u2019re installing them. Add 15% to your square footage calculations to account for any extra tile you may need. Some tiles may even be broken on arrival or in the box. For example, if you have a square footage of 300 feet (91 m), add 15% to get a total square footage (including overage) of 345 feet (105 m). Divide your square footage by the square footage on the box. A common way to buy tiles is to buy them by the box. On the box of tile is listed the total square footage that all the tiles in the box will cover. Take this number and use it to divide the total square footage of the area where you plan to lay the tile. Round up to the nearest whole number if you get a decimal.
