This is especially important if you're hungry and your mind is on food. If you're stomach is growling during Salah and you're thinking only about food, your concentration is not on the prayer. That's why it's highly encouraged to eat before the prayer. The scholars of Islam have stated that, \"Beginning by eating food (when Salah is present), is allowed at a time when a person is extremely hungry and he wishes to eat, but there is sufficient time for Salah. If this is not the case, then he must begin with Salah since this was the practice of the Prophet (SAW)\". (Umdatul Qari \u2013Commentary of Sahih Al Bukhari)."

Bless the food You have provided us and save us from the punishment of the hell fire. In the name of Allah.\" It was narrated from Umm Kalthoom from \u2018Aa\u2019ishah that the Messenger of Allaah (SAW) said: \u201cWhen any one of you eats, let him mention the name of Allah. If he forgets to mention the name of Allah at the beginning, then let him say \u2018Bismillahi  awwalahu wa aakhirahu (In the name of Allah at the beginning and at the end).\u2019\u201d Always eat with your right hand. In Islam, most daily tasks are done with the right hand. Shaytan (Satan) eats with his left hand, so all Muslims are required to eat food with their right hand to differ from him, and to honor the right hand over the left. In al-Saheehayn it is narrated that \u2018Umar ibn Salamah said that The Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: \u201cO young boy, say the name of Allah and eat with your right hand, and eat from what is nearest to you.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5376) and Muslim (2022). In Sunan Abi Dawood (33), it is narrated that \u2018Aa\u2019ishah said: The right hand of the Messenger of Allah (SAW) was for his purification and food, and his left hand was for using the toilet and anything that was dirty. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. A reason for not eating with your right hand is injury or sickness. If, for example, you end up spraining your right hand and it's easiest to eat with your left, this is an acceptable reason to use your left hand. Eat what's directly in front of you. Avoid reaching out to get food from the middle of the plate or food that is from other people's plates. It is Sunnah and better manners to eat what is directly in front of your plate. The Prophet (SAW) said to Umar ibn Abi Salamah, \u201cO young boy, say Bismillaah, eat with your right hand, and eat from what is directly in front of you.\u201d (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3576; Muslim, 2022) Eat with three fingers. When eating finger food or using an utensil, it is Sunnah to eat using only three fingers. Eating with more than three is considered a sign of greed, and using only three fingers is the normal and common amount of fingers to use while eating a meal. Ka'b bin Maalik narrated that he saw the prophet Muhammad (SAW) licking his three fingers (after having finished the food). (Sahih Muslim Hadith 5039) Sit down properly when you're eating. Avoid laying down or reclining as you eat. Not only does this have potentially dangerous health effects such as choking, heartburn, and GERD, but it's also discouraged in Islam. It was narrated that the Prophet (SAW) said: \u201cI do not eat whilst I am reclining.\u201d (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5399)\nIn some cases, eating while laying down is acceptable. For example, if you have a high fever and can't get out of bed but need to eat, eating while laying down in bed would be okay to do in this case for your well-being. Pick up food if you accidentally drop it. If you mistakenly drop food on the ground while eating, pick it up immediately and blow it off to remove any dirt. Anas ibn Malik narrated that that the Prophet (SAW) said, \"If any one of you drops a piece of food, let him remove any dirt from it and eat it, and not leave it for the Shaytaan.\" (Narrated by Muslim, 2034). If you happen to drop food and don't notice it until you're done eating, do not eat it. The food should be thrown away as it contains dirt and bacteria from the long timing on the ground. Try to always eat with a group. It is Sunnah to eat with a group, such as with your family. Eating together allows you to bond together and brings you together as you talk and communicate with each other. It's also a blessing to eat together and brings barakah (closeness of Allah) to the family. Wahshi bin Harb reported: Some of the companions of the Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: \u201cWe eat but are not satisfied.\u201d He (SAW) said, \u201c\u201dPerhaps you eat separately.\u201d The Companions replied in the affirmative. He then said: \u201cEat together and mention the Name of Allah over your food. It will be blessed for you.\u201d [Abu Dawud]. If it's time to pray by the time you set the table to eat, eat first. If, by the time you set the table and everyone is ready to eat, the Athan (call of prayer) goes off, eat first. This is especially important if you're hungry and your mind is on food. If you're stomach is growling during Salah and you're thinking only about food, your concentration is not on the prayer. That's why it's highly encouraged to eat before the prayer. The scholars of Islam have stated that, \"Beginning by eating food (when Salah is present), is allowed at a time when a person is extremely hungry and he wishes to eat, but there is sufficient time for Salah. If this is not the case, then he must begin with Salah since this was the practice of the Prophet (SAW)\". (Umdatul Qari \u2013Commentary of Sahih Al Bukhari). Praise Allah after eating. After you finish eating, it is encouraged to praise Allah by saying Alhamdulillah (\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0644\u0644\u0647), which means 'Praise be to Allah'. The Prophet Muhammad (SAW) said: \"Allah will be pleased with His slave who praises Him (i.e., says Alhamdulillah) when he eats and praises Him and when he drinks.\" You can also say the Dua when you're finished with your meal. The most common Dua to say after you're done is Alhamdulillah il-lathi at'amana wasaqona waja'alana Muslimeen. (Praise be to Allah Who has fed us and given us drink, and made us Muslims). Wash your hands when you're done and clean up. After you're done eating, be sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water. Clear the table and help clean up, if necessary. This is proper Islamic manners, especially if you're eating at someone else's house. Etiquette While Eating Avoid criticizing food or stating that you hate it. While it's okay not to like every food, it's discouraged to criticize food on the dinner table. If you don't like the food you are given, kindly refuse it and say you don't want it. You don't need to outright say you hate it. This is the Sunnah of the Prophet (SAW). Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet (SAW) never criticized any food. If he liked it he would eat it, and if he did not like it he would leave it. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3370; Muslim, 2046) Eat in moderation. Avoid eating until you're full, as this is not proper etiquette in Islam and is also unhealthy. Eat until you are no longer hungry, which is enough to help you last till your next meal. Al-Hassan Al-Basri said: \"O, son of Adam, eat with one third of your stomach and drink with one third and leave one third of your stomach to breathe so that you may think [and work better].\" Avoid eating from plates or cups made from gold or silver. Hudhayfah B. al-Yam\u00e2n relates that Allah\u2019s Messenger (SAW) said: \u201cDo not drink from gold and silver vessels and do not eat from gold and silver dishes, because indeed they are for them in this world and for you in the Hereafter.\u201d Eat from normal plates and cups that are made from plastic, glass, or paper, instead. Eat calmly and don't rush. Avoid rushing when you're eating and shoving as much as food as possible in your mouth. Take your time to chew and swallow as you enjoy your meal. Not only is eating too fast a health risk and choking hazard, it's not proper etiquette. Know proper table manners, especially around others. Follow basic table manners when eating, such as not chewing with your mouth open, not eating too loudly, and not talking when you're eating. If you're eating with a group, be sure to let everyone have a turn to speak. Simple words such as \"Please\", \"Thank you\" and \"Excuse me\" go a long way as well and are a good example of table manners. When eating with a group or with your family, avoid having a heated discussion that may lead to an argument. The dinner table should be calm and pleasant as you eat; it doesn't need to be a war zone with fights and debates. Avoid eating your food if it's piping hot. If your food is too hot to eat, wait patiently until it is cool. It is not permissible to blow on it to cool it off because Ibn Abbaas said: \"The Prophet (SAW) forbade blowing onto food and drink.\u201d [Ahmad] Let the food cool off until it's at a comfortable temperature to eat. Refrain from wasting food. Food should not be wasted in Islam and it is not permissible to throw it out in the trash. In Fatawa  al-Lajnah al-Daa\u2019imah (22/341) it was said: \"Leftover food must be saved for the next time or it should be given to the needy; if there are no needy people, then it should be given to animals, even after it has dried out, for the one who is able to do that.\" Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan said: \"It is not permissible to throw any food into dirty places or impure places such as washrooms, because that is a waste [and] mistreatment of the blessing and a lack of gratitude to Allah.\" Consider sharing and serving the meal to others. It's Sunnah to share and serve your food with your family, friends, guests, and to others who are hungry and need it such as those who are poor. This small action of sharing brings a lot of blessing and Hasanat (rewards).",
