Place the salmon in a zip seal plastic bag, then submerge it in the water. The water should be steaming hot (not boiling), so just turn on the hot water on your kitchen faucet. Check it after 5 minutes. If it\u2019s not soft and flexible, dump the container, refill it with fresh hot water, and thaw the fish for another 1 to 2 minutes. You shouldn\u2019t thaw salmon at room temperature for a long period of time. A quick, 5 minute hot bath isn\u2019t a food safety concern, but sitting on the countertop for a few hours is not safe."

Other great seasoning options for salmon include lemon, minced garlic, and fresh or dried herbs, such as dill or thyme. You could brush both sides with an even coat of oil, place the fish skin side down on the baking tray, then sprinkle salt and pepper over it. If you don\u2019t have a basting brush, you can just use your hands or a spoon to spread the oil. For more complex flavors, try mixing 1/2 stick of melted butter, the juice of 2 lemons, 2 minced garlic cloves, and a tablespoon of dried dill. Brush the salmon with this mixture, then sprinkle it with pinches of salt and pepper."
