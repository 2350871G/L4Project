          "description":"Metal railings are usually attached to wood with screws, and to other sections of railing with bolts. If your railing is loose, check these connections first and tighten the fasteners with a screwdriver or wrench. If a bolt won\u2019t tighten securely by hand, remove it, check for damage, and replace it with another bolt of the same size. If a screw won\u2019t tighten into wood, try replacing it with a slightly larger screw. If that doesn\u2019t work, find a plastic wall anchor that fits snugly into the hole in the wood and press it into the hole. The anchor will expand and grip the surrounding wood when you drive the screw into it."

          "description":"If a fastener that you need to tighten or remove is rusted into place, spray it with a penetrating oil and wait 30 minutes. The oil should loosen the connection enough for you to tighten or loosen the fastener. You can buy penetrating oil at any hardware store. Penetrating oil comes in an aerosol can with a plastic straw attachment for precision spraying. Use the straw so you can spray the oil deeper into the connection."

Take out screws or bolts with a screwdriver, or pull out nails with pliers. You\u2019ll find plastic anchors embedded in the concrete. If these are secure and in good shape, leave them alone.

They will expand the anchors more and may solve your loose railing problem. If necessary, take the old fasteners to a hardware store to pick out slightly larger replacements. If the anchors are damaged, replace them with new ones of the same size."

          "description":"Railings that are embedded into concrete can rust in that connection area, causing the railing to loosen or even break free. Use a reciprocating saw with a metal-cutting blade to slice through the posts and free the railing. Squeeze the trigger on the saw, and the long blade will move back and forth rapidly and slice through the metal with minimal effort. Remove any other connections made by fasteners like screws or bolts as well, so that you can completely remove the railing section. In some cases, the post may be rusted through so severely that you can simply twist or snap it free. Wear eye protection and follow the product safety recommendations when using a reciprocating saw. Also be careful for sharp pieces of rusted metal once you remove the railing section."

Simply place the tip of the bit against the concrete, press down to hold the drill in place, and squeeze the trigger. The concrete should break up fairly easily. If you don\u2019t have a hammer drill, you can also use a hammer, masonry chisel, and lots of muscle power! In either case, be sure to wear eye protection. Chip away just enough material to get the rest of each metal post out.

Use a drill with a 0.25 in (6.4 mm) bit intended for use with metal. Then, use a rivet gun to \u201cshoot\u201d an expanding 0.25 in (6.4 mm) rivet into the hole. Repeat this with each of the other repaired posts. If you don\u2019t have a rivet gun, you can skip this step. However, the repaired joint will be more likely to loosen over time."
