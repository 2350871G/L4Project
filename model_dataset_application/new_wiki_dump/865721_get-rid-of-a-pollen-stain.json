Gently work the pretreatment solution of your choice into the stain and allow it to sit for at least 20 minutes before washing. Before pretreating, test the solution on an inconspicuous area to test for color-fastness. Enzyme cleaners work by breaking down biological substances (such as the fat in pollen pigment) and thus generally work best for this type of stain."
