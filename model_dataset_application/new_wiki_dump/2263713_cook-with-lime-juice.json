          "description":"Every marinade is made up of an acid, an oil, and flavorings. The oil moistens the meat while spices and herbs seep in, adding pronounced flavor. The acid breaks the meat down, allowing the oil and seasonings to do their job. Vinegar and lemon juice are the most common acids used, but lime juice is also acidic enough to do the trick. Lime juice goes especially well with chicken and fish. The simplest marinades use equal parts oil and acid. For most marinades, you will need to prepare 1/2 cup per pound (125 milliliters per 450 grams) of meat, or 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) lime juice and 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) olive oil per pound."

Due to the oil, however, the cooking process will not be as thorough, leaving you with raw meat that turns tough upon cooking it with heat. Marinate pork and beef for 2 hours to allow them ample time to soak in the marinade. Large, dense cuts can last up to 1 or 2 days before turning tough. Marinate chicken for about 1 hour. Chicken and other types of poultry are less dense than pork or beef, so marinades have a stronger effect. Do not allow chicken to marinate for much longer than 8 to 10 hours. Marinate seafood for 30 minutes. Fish has a remarkably light density and acidic lime juice will have a strong effect on it early on. Do not allow fish to marinate for more than 60 minutes, or it will begin \"cooking\" and will end up with a tough, unpleasant texture once you continue cooking it with heat."
