This works better when making an even number of cupcakes. You can also get a clear box, like a donut box, to put all of the cupcakes in when finished.This article is going to be referring to a baby onesie . Get your onesie and fold it like you would fold paper (folding hot-dog wise). Do this until the onesie is thin. Fold the baby sock in half and place it at the very end of the onesie strip.  Start loosely rolling the strip, starting at the end where the sock is. Make sure the sock stays visible. Once you're done rolling, it should start to look like a cupcake! Tape the loose end to the cupcake to prevent it from coming off. Gently sit the cupcake in the wrapper without letting it unravel. Get the thin ribbon and tie it around the cupcake to hold it together. Repeat for several different cupcakes. Sit them all neatly in the container.
