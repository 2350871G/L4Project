This is the main part of creating your game, since it shows how much quality your game has. If you're not that good at drawing, you can always create your sprites by getting images from the Internet. If this is your first time creating a game, start simple and don't go overboard. In Club Penguin, the main characters are penguins, but you can do any characters that you want, whether they are animals or people."

Start this by creating an event. To have an object do what you want it to do, browse through the events, and then through the commands."
