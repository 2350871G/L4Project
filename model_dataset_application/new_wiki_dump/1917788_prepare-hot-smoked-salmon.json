      "description":"Brining is the process of soaking meat or fish before cooking. Each person who smokes fish has their own preferences for how to formulate a brine, but it almost always includes both a salty and a sweet flavor. For beginners to smoking, a simple brine of kosher salt and brown sugar is a good point of departure. How much you need depends on how much fish you have. For each quart of water, add half a cup of kosher salt and half a cup of brown sugar. Use a plastic or glass container, never use metal containers for brining."

      "description":"Remove it from the brine about an hour before you are ready to start smoking it, and place it on racks to dry. Some prefer to pat the fish down with a paper towel as well. After about an hour, the fish should have a noticeable sheen on it that will make it \"glisten\" slightly. When you see that, it is ready to be smoked."
