This is a highly variable number of stitches depending on the size of the gloves you want to create, the type of yarn, and the size of your double-pointed needles.To cast on, loop the yarn over the left-hand needle. Push your right-hand needle into the loop on the left-hand needle, and then yarn over the right-hand needle. Use the right-hand needle to bring this new loop through the loop on the left-hand needle. This will create another cast-on stitch on the right-hand needle. Continue casting on until you have the required number of stitches. Make sure to distribute the stitches evenly among 3 or 4 of the double-pointed needles. Keep 1 needle empty to work the stitches. For example, if you need to cast on 36 stitches, then cast on 12 stitches per needle to divide them among 3 needles or 9 stitches per needle to divide them among 4 needles."
