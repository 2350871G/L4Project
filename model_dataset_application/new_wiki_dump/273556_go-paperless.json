Contact the Mail Preference Service and request that you be placed on a do-not-mail list and contact individual mailers to have your address removed. You can't go through the postal service, because the mail deliverer can't legally decide what mail addressed \"To Resident\" is undesirable. If you don't want it, contact them at the source.
