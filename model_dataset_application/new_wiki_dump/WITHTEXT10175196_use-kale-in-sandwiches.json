Baby kale is soft enough that it doesn't need to be cooked down before you eat it. You can even add kale to a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for some extra fiber without changing the flavor of the sandwich too much. Just put a thin layer in between the peanut butter and jelly."

Trim off the stem from each leaf and add it to a hot pan with some olive oil, salt, and pepper. Saut\u00e9 the kale for 4-5 minutes until it starts to wilt. Remove it from the heat and let it cool down before adding it to your sandwich. You can store extra cooked kale in your fridge in an air-tight container for 1 week."

Place your toppings on the kale (meat, cheese, veggies, spreads, or whatever else you like in a sandwich). Roll the leaf up into a wrap, and then cut it in half to make it easier to handle. A cup of kale has 33 calories in it\u2014much less that even 1 piece of bread! Plus, if you're gluten-free or vegan, a kale wrap lets you still enjoy a sandwich."
