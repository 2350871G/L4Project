Sleeves are typically available from used music and record shops, as well as online retailers like Amazon, Sleeve City USA, and Bags Unlimited. Most vinyl records will require either 7 in (18 cm), 10 in (25 cm), or 12 in (30 cm) sleeves. Avoid cheap inner sleeves as they wear easily and may not provide adequate protection for your disc. Cheap outer sleeves, like those made from polypropylene, will generally not affect the quality of protection, though they may discolor over time."

For quick, cheap solutions, wooden crates and plastic tubs work great. For something safer but more expensive, look for archival plastic storage tubs and mobile vinyl boxes.

When exposed to extreme cold, your records will become brittle, making them easy to break. If possible, keep your records at just below room temperature, or 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C), for best results. If your records are exposed to extreme cold, slowly increase the temperature over a period of many hours. Moving suddenly from cold to hot may cause unwanted condensation, ruining the album cover."

Unless they are sealed and well-insulated, avoid basements, attics, sheds, garages, and similar areas. If possible, store your records in a room with 35% humidity, the amount recommended by professional archivists."

Instead, make sure your albums are loosely packed together so that only the cardboard edges are exposed to dust. For optimal results, expect to dust the edges of your records about once a week."
