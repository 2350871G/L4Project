Run a faucet over the leeks and use your fingers to brush off and dig out any dirt. Whole leeks are often dirty because they are grown with soil piled up around them and the folds of the leek collect dirt and grit."

After you rinse them well, take a paper towel or cloth and pat them down to sop up any excess water. You don\u2019t need to wait for them to dry completely, just remove the water that could cause them to slide around while you cut."

The green leaf ends of leeks can be really tough to chew and aren\u2019t ideal for eating. Use a sharp knife to cut where the dark green of the leek turns to light green and remove the leafy green ends.Tip: You can collect all of the leafy green ends to use to make a stock for your soup! Put them all into a pot of simmering water for 30 minutes to extract their flavor, then strain the stock for use in your soup."

Put them all into a pot of simmering water for 30 minutes to extract their flavor, then strain the stock for use in your soup. Cutting into Rings Start at one end and slice the leeks into thin rings. Place the leek on a cutting board and start cutting at one end, slicing thin \u20444 in (0.64 cm) or less rings. Cut the whole length of the leek into rings. When you are finished with one leek, move on to the next.Warning: Do not try to cut multiple leeks at once or they could slip and you could cut yourself.

Keep pressure on the blade as you pull it towards you. Take a sharp kitchen knife and hone it before you slice the leeks. Place the leeks cut side down and slice the halves into long, thin strips. After you\u2019ve cut your leeks in half, place them on the cutting board with the cut side down so they don\u2019t roll or slide around when you cut them. Start at the top of the leek and bring the blade towards you to cut strips about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) wide. Cut the whole leek into thin strips. Submerge the strips in a bowl of cold water.
