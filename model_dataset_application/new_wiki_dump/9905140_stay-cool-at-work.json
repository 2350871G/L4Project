Not only will water keep you cool throughout the day, it can keep you hydrated and avoid fatigue throughout the day. Avoid caffeinated drinks like coffee or tea. The caffeine increases blood flow and raises body temperature, regardless of if the drink is hot or cold."

          "description":"Not only do large meals make your body work harder, they can also make you more sluggish. To avoid the afternoon slump, consider grazing on healthy snacks, like nuts and fruits, throughout the day rather than eating a hearty lunch. Stick to cold foods like light salads or sandwiches if you can. Frozen fruit throughout the day is a healthy alternative that will also cool you down as you eat it! Let the fruit thaw for 10 minutes before eating it, either with a fork or your fingers."

          "description":"To stop your hair from getting too warm on your neck, wear your hair in a high ponytail or bun. Use fabric hair ties to keep your hair up and avoid the sweat. Use barrettes or bobby pins to keep hair out of your face and off your forehead."

          "description":"To help cool the main veins that move blood through the body, go to the bathroom and run cool water over your wrists for 30 seconds. Not only will it be a refreshing feeling immediately, it can help keep you cool for a little while afterward too. To avoid getting up from a desk or job site, hold a cold water bottle to your wrists for the same amount of time for a similar effect."

          "description":"Materials like cotton or linen will be more breathable and help control your body temperature, unlike thick fabrics like polyester or rayon. Use light colors in your outfit since they reflect heat while darker colors will absorb heat. Wear looser fit clothes if possible so air can circulate through them more efficiently rather than being trapped."

Use external keyboards if you work on laptops to avoid overheating components right underneath your hands."

Personal fans can be purchased online or many big-box retailers. Personal fans range from basic AC adapters to USB-powered. Find one that fits best in your workspace."

Many of these sprays can be purchased online or even made at home with water and essential oils. Make your own spray by filling a spritzer bottle with distilled water and adding 8 to 10 drops of peppermint essential oil."
