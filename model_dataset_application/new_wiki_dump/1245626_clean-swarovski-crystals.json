You may also want to wear cotton gloves to handle your jewelry since fingerprints may show up on the crystals if you handle them with your bare hands. Your best bet is to use the dry cloth method for light cleaning or general maintenance of your Swarovski crystal jewelry. Polish the crystals. Use the lint free cloth to gently polish each crystal individually. Use a small circular motion to polish each crystal. Polishing your Swarovski crystal jewelry periodically with a lint free cloth is the best way to maintain the luster of your jewelry and keep it looking beautiful for years.

Move the toothbrush in a circular motion to gently clean away dirt. Focus on cleaning one crystal at a time. Rinse away soap.
