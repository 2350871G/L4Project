          "description":"You'll have a longer harvest if you plant several varieties that have different maturities. If your cabbages are maturing at different times, you'll have fresh cabbage longer. Cabbage maturities vary from 60 to 120 days. Cabbage varieties are grouped according to when they are harvested. Spring cabbages are ready the earliest, from mid to late spring. Summer cabbages can be harvested in late summer and early fall. Cabbages categorized as fall and winter cabbages are harvested later in the fall. If you want a variety with a longer harvesting period, you might pick the Savoy cabbage. The harvesting season for this variety starts in early fall and extends into winter and early spring of the next year."

Place them in a spot where they'll get plenty of sunlight, or set them under grow lamps with temperatures between 60 and 70 \u00b0F (16 and 21 \u00b0C). If you don't want to start your cabbage from seeds yourself, you can buy transplant seedlings from a local grower or at a nursery or farmer's market."

Water the bed thoroughly after fertilizing it, and make sure it stays moist until you transplant your seedlings."

          "headline":"Move your seedlings outdoors after 3 to 4 weeks.",
          "description":"Start your seeds indoors for a couple of weeks, then transfer them to your garden. Seedlings exposed to cold will become hardened so that frost won't kill them. You will need to harden the seedlings off gradually by setting them outside in a sheltered area for an increasing number of hours each day for about a week. Once they\u2019re hardened, set your plants so that 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of the main stem is buried in the soil. While hardening off the seedlings, place them in an area where they won\u2019t be exposed to harsh wind or direct sunlight. Leave them out for 1-2 hours at a time to start, then gradually work your way up to 7 or 8 hours by the end of the week. Thin the seedlings so that there is only 1 seedling per cell or pot that you transplant. You can wait until the seeds have germinated, then pick the strongest seedling in each tray. Seedlings should have at least 3 or 4 adult leaves before you transplant them."

Set the seedlings in rows 12 to 24 inches (30 to 61 cm) apart. For fall or winter varieties, leave a minimum of 24 inches (61 cm) between each seedling, if not a little more.Tip: The closer together you plant your cabbages, the smaller the heads will be. If you want larger heads, set your seedlings further apart."

Spinach, kale, and dill are some other plants that are helpful near cabbage. Avoid planting cabbage near broccoli, cauliflower, strawberries, or tomatoes. These crops compete for similar nutrients and will deplete your soil faster. Plant them on the other side of the garden, or at least 4 feet (1.2 m) away for best results. The Old Farmer's Almanac has a table of companion plantings available at https://www.almanac.com/content/companion-planting-guide.Tip: Dill protects your cabbage by attracting beneficial wasps that kill cabbage worms and other pests."

Nets and row covers can be used to protect your cabbage from airborne pests.Variation: Another way to protect your cabbages from pests is to plant a sacrificial crop or trap crop nearby.

When watering and mulching, inspect your cabbage for signs of pests or disease. Spraying with a biological pesticide every other week can keep pest damage to a minimum. Take care not to wet the foliage of your cabbages, especially in cooler weather. Wet leaves can make your cabbages more vulnerable to disease.
