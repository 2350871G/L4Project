      "headline":"Wear clothes more than once before washing.",
      "description":"Check clothes for stains or dirt before throwing them in the laundry basket. If you did not perform any strenuous activities and the clothes are not dirty, wear them again before washing. This will extend the life of your clothes as well as reduce laundry as the fibers will gradually break down through repeated washing and drying. Hang up clothes immediately after you take them off if you can wear them again. Certain items of clothing, especially outer layers such as cardigans, sweaters or suit jackets may not get very dirty, but you may need to wash or dry clean them frequently because they become wrinkly."

      "headline":"Spot clean stains as soon as you notice them.",
      "description":"Use a detergent stick if you are on the go, or you can choose to use a little bit of liquid detergent to remove the stain before it sets. Gently rub in the detergent, rinse with warm water, and pat the material dry."

      "description":"For example, if you have certain outfits that you designate as \"church clothes,\" wear a formal outfit to church and change into a casual outfit once you get home. Since you will only be wearing your formal outfits for a few hours at a time, you can wash them much less frequently."
