          "description":"One of the most common unhealthy ingredients in cereal is sugar. Always check the nutrition facts on your cereal, and limit sugar to 4 \u2013 5 grams per serving, whenever possible. Getting up to 8 grams of sugar per serving is okay if the cereal contains real fruit or lots of fiber. In general, cereals targeted toward children will have added sugars to make them more appealing. Avoid breakfast cereals with \u201cfrosted,\u201d \u201csweetened,\u201d \u201csugary,\u201d or \u201cfruity\u201d in the name. Remember that adult cereals very commonly contain sugar as well. If an unsweetened cereal tastes too bland, try adding fresh fruit or even a half-teaspoon of sugar or honey at home instead of buying a sweetened breakfast cereal. This way, you can better manage the added sugar and slowly wean yourself off of it at your own pace."

High fructose corn syrup, fructose, dextrose, glucose, corn syrup, cane sugar, raw sugar, monosaccharide, molasses, and \u201cother sweeteners\u201d indicate sugar content. Some lesser known sugar additives are barley malt, cane sugar, concentrated juice (apple, pear, grape), honey, invert sugar, levulose, malt syrup, rice syrup, sorghum, and turbinado sugar.
