  "text":" Sewing the bird's tail and wings Draw out the bird shapes. Follow the image for the template designs. Transfer the designs to the fabric. The pieces consist of the bird's body (two side pieces, one top piece, one belly piece, four wings, two tail pieces). Cut out the shapes on the chosen fabric. Provide at least 1/2 inch/1.5cm seam allowance. Cut cotton wadding lining to the same size as the fabric pieces. Cut out extra cotton lining as needed. Place the right sides of the tail fabric pieces and wing fabric pieces face to face, with the cotton wadding pieces inserted in the center. Sew the tail and two wings together using straight stitch. Leave an opening at the base of the sewn items to allow them to be turned right side out. Trim the seam allowance using pinking shears. Sewing the body of the bird Turn the tail and wings inside out, to face them the right side out. Sew some decorative stitches on them (such as a cross, a flower, etc.). (See image one of this trio.) Lay the body fabric pieces out as shown in image two of this trio of images. The body of bird is made of one top piece, two side pieces and a belly piece (see the section above for image of cut pieces). Sew one of the side pieces of fabric to the top of the body piece. Align the fabric pieces correctly before sewing. Use back stitch. Sew the remaining side piece of fabric to the exact opposite side of the top of the body piece. As you sew, fold the seam allowance from the other side piece inside a little. Add the belly piece. Still using back stitch, add the belly piece to the top piece of the body, leaving an open side (for turning inside out). Trim the seam allowance using pinking shears when completed. Turn the bird inside out from the opening and stuff the bird. Finishing the bird Add the facial features. Cut out a piece of felt in a diamond shape. Fold in half and sew on as the bird's beak. Sew on two small black beads to make the bird's eyes. Attach a button to each wing, using a dark thread to sew a crossover in the buttonholes. Insert the tail into the bird through the opening left after turning the bird inside out. Sew this opening together using invisible thread or very tiny stitches. Trim any threads or excess fabric away. Adjust as needed and the bird is complete.",
