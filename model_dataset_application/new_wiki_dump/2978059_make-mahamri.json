If you live in a warm or tropical area, the dough may only need a couple hours to rise. Keep checking on the size of your dough if you are unsure how long you should leave it."

Preparing the Dough for Frying Divide the dough into five balls. After the dough has finished rising completely, divide it into five equally sized balls. Treat the dough with a light hand and do your best not to squash or over-handle it. Coat the dough balls with flour and let them rise. After you have made your five balls of dough, sprinkle flour on a counter or cutting board and gently roll the balls in the flour to coat them. Then cover the balls with a clean cloth and let the dough rise for 15 minutes. Roll out each ball and shape them into circles. Sprinkle more flour onto the cutting board, then use a rolling pin to roll each ball until flat. The flattened balls should now roughly look like circles. Use your hands to cup and shape the dough into circles if they are misshapen. Cut the dough circles into quarters. Use a sharp knife to cut each circle into quarters. You will have 20 triangular pieces of dough, which you will now fry up and make into your mahamri. Frying the Mahamri Pour the oil into a wide, deep frying pan over medium heat. Once the dough is prepared, pour the cooking oil into a deep frying pan. Make sure to pour at least three inches of oil into the pan. Try to use a cooking oil with a high smoke point that is meant to be used in deep frying. Peanut oil, for example, has a high smoke point, while olive and vegetable oil do not. Test the oil.

Fry the other mahamri in batches. Repeat the same process of frying for the other sixteen mahamri, frying in batches of four at a time.
