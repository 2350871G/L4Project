          "description":"You can cover your gazing ball with a variety of things including pennies, glass marbles, gems, or crushed tinted glass. Decide on what would go best with your landscaping and garden, and choose a material that compliments it. Make sure to consider the material's colors when creating your gazing ball. If you're going for a lighter, colorful garden, turquoise glass gems make the perfect material. Lighter weight materials like coins or gems may be easier to attach to your gazing ball. If you're going for a more rustic look, try finding flat stones in your garden."

Apply two light coats of primer instead of one thick coat. Once you're done spraying your primer, allow it to dry. Drying should take around an hour. Two light coats of primer will prevent your paint from dripping later on."

Use a color that will blend in with the materials that you will attach to your ball. Do not use colors that clash or that stand out. Once you're done painting your ball, allow it to dry before moving onto the next step. For example, dark blue and purple stones look best when your orb is painted black. Brown may be good color for a gazing ball that uses stones from the garden."

Use a strong adhesive like epoxy or super glue and attach your covering materials to your ball. Apply the glue to the flat side of the material you're using and press the material against the ball. Work from one point on the ball and make a full ring around the ball if you want to keep your lines symmetrical. When going for a rustic or artistic look, you can lay your stones asymmetrically."

If you used a lighter material like a round lamp cover and want to place it on a stand, you should attach it to your base using an adhesive, so that it doesn't fall and break."
