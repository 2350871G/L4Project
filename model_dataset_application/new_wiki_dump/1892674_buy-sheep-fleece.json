          "description":"Consider wool from Australia or New Zealand. Australia is the leader producer of wool in the world, and the country's wool mainly comes from Merino sheep, which have the highest quality wool. The second leading wool producer is New Zealand, which provides crossbred wool from Merino sheep bred with other types of sheep. Australian and New Zealand wool can be purchased online or through woolen mill catalogs. Consider wool from the United States. The majority of wool in the U.S. comes from Texas, Colorado, California, Wyoming and New Mexico, where most commercial sheep farmers breed Rambouillet (French Merino) sheep. Buy American wool online or through woolen mill catalogs."

          "description":"Purchase sheep fleece from a woolen mill or warehouse. A woolen mill provides an extensive selection of sheep fleece in large quantities. The wool at woolen mills and warehouses is typically provided through large-scale sheep farmers. Buy sheep fleece from wool pools or fiber co-ops. A wool pool or fiber cop-op is a group of fleece producers who combine their wool yields for increased sales potential. Often, sheep farmers don't produce enough fleece to sell directly to a warehouse or woolen mill, so they work with other sheep farmers in their region to market their wool. Wool pools and co-ops typically offer a variety of fleece options sorted by type and classification. Purchase fleece directly from a local farmer. Small farmers raise sheep for specific markets, such as hand spinning, weaving and knitting. For example, a small farmer may produce only long wools, which are commonly preferred by hand spinners. Buy sheep fleece from a local carding mill. A carding mill is an establishment that cleans and brushes fleece using machines. Carding mill workers may sell you raw fleece or direct you to local sheep farmers."

          "description":"Wool is typically available as raw fleece, roving or curly locks. Choose raw fleece for an actual skirted fleece. The wool is in its natural state, cut from the sheep and usually not cleaned. Choose roving for wool that has been combed, cleaned and twisted to the hold the fibers together. Roving is usually fine and very soft, and is often used for spinning. Choose curly locks for soft, curly wool. Curly locks are usually cleaned and combed, and are ideal for craft projects like dolls or Santa beards. Curly locks also can be used for spinning and knitting, but the curls may create additional texture in the finished products."

          "description":"Select greasy wool if you intend to wash the wool after receiving it. Wool in its pure form off of the sheep is known as greasy wool because it not cleaned and contains high levels of lanolin. Greasy wool also may contain dirt, vegetable matter, dead skin and sweat residue. You can wash or scour the wool on your own with warm water and a mild detergent. You may need to remove vegetable matter and larger clumps of dirt by hand. Because it has not yet been processed, greasy wool is usually cheaper than scoured wool. However, the greasy wool will shrink after washing, so the quantity you order may not be a true indication of the finished product yield. Select scoured wool for cleaned fleece. Large commercial wool providers use industrial detergents and alkali to clean the wool. They also may remove vegetable matter through a process of chemical carbonization. Smaller farmers may simply clean the wool by soaking it in a mild detergent and warm water. Scoured wool is more expensive than greasy wool, but the wool is already pre-shrunk."

Long wool sheep fleece can be used for almost any apparel. Consider medium wool sheep fleece for lighter weight fibers. Medium wool sheep are usually raised for meat, not fiber.
