Good storage devices include hard plastic storage cases and glass or plastic coin tubes. Coin folders can be problematic because they expose your coins to air. However, if you have the original, airtight packaging, you can keep the coin in the packaging and place it in the folder. Make sure that the flaps are made of mylar, rather than soft plastic with PVC. Many varieties of coin containers may be purchased online. Silver is susceptible to tarnish from sulfur compounds and nitrates. These are chemical compounds that exist in the air as a result of pollution."

The best hiding places include unlikely locations like the bottom the of a clothes\u2019 basket. For any substantial silver collection you should purchase a safe. The safe should be too large too carry away and rated UL-15 or higher. An added advantage to owning a safe is that if you notify your insurance company, they will reduce your premium. For added safety, consider an alarm system as well.
