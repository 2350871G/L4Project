          "description":"The crevices in broccoli can easily hide dirt and even small bugs. Run cold water over the broccoli head, and use your fingers to rub clean any dirty spots. For broccoli that is particularly dirty, fill your sink with cold water and let the broccoli soak for 2 to 3 minutes. Soaking the broccoli will loosen any crusted particles that you were unable to rub off. Then, rinse the broccoli for a second time to wash away the dislodged dirt. If you are using packaged broccoli florets, pour the contents into a colander and rinse the florets under cold water."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Dry off the broccoli head with a paper towel.",
          "description":"Gently pat the broccoli until it is completely dry. The crevices can hold water just as easily as they can hold dirt, so rotate the broccoli head as you are patting it. Drying the broccoli will give you extra traction for when you go to cut it later, and will also prevent any dressings you put onto it from becoming watery. Do not rub the surface of the broccoli to dry it. Excess pressure against the bundle of florets might cause pieces to start to break off."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use a sharp knife to cut the florets from the main stem of the broccoli.",
          "description":"Do this on a cutting board to avoid damaging your counter or table. Cut the florets until they are broken into pieces of about 1 inch (2.5 cm). Trim any brown or damaged-looking parts as they may be rotten. The broccoli might still be wet, so be careful when cutting and trimming it. The florets are the dark green, bushy parts. Each will have a small stem, or a bundle of small stems. While the stems are completely edible, not everyone likes to eat them raw because they can be stringy or tough. Taste one of the stems and determine for yourself whether you want to keep the them or not. A medium head of broccoli will yield approximately 3-4 cups (525 g-700 g) of florets."

          "description":"Broccoli has a simple taste that can be paired subtly with lemon pepper, or salt and black pepper, or combined with bold flavors like balsamic vinegar, basil, and fresh ginger. These common flavors will add to natural taste of the broccoli, and can even be combined with other raw vegetables to make a salad. Some other classic broccoli seasonings include garlic powder, cumin, curry powder, cayenne pepper, cilantro, and rosemary."

          "description":"By making your own dressing, you will be able to experiment with the texture and consistency of the dressing. Add more vinegar to thin out the dressing, or add more sour cream to thicken it up. If you don\u2019t have time to whip up your own dressing, grab the store-bought ranch and dip the florets in that for a quick snack. For a quick ranch-style dressing, mix together a \u20442 cup (120 mL) of mayonnaise, a \u20444 cup (59 mL) of sour cream, 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of white distilled vinegar, and 2 tablespoons (9.6 g) of ranch seasoning mix."

Add in the florets from 1 medium head of broccoli, and toss everything together. The simple dressing will have spicy and acidic flavoring from the mustard and lemon juice. Add different textures with the florets that will complement the seasoning. Cherry tomatoes or sliced almonds will add an extra crunch, and 1 clove of minced garlic will add a pop of flavor."

Take 1 cup (240 mL) of Greek yogurt, the juice from half a lemon, and season it with your favorite spices. Play with the different amounts of spices to make the dip fit your tastes. Start with approximately 1/2 tsp (0.8 g) of the spices, and increase the amounts from there. Try a combination of onion powder, garlic powder, salt, black pepper, dried dill, and dried parsley for a mild tasting dip. Experiment with bold flavors like a mixture of paprika, fresh chives, and minced garlic."

To do this simply put the coated florets into a plastic bag, seal the bag, and let it rest in the refrigerator for a minimum of 2 hours or overnight. The flavors will have softened the florets and thoroughly seasoned them. If the lemon marinade sounds too simple or bland, then consider making a vinegar-based marinade instead. Using the florets from 2 medium heads of broccoli, mix together 1 cup (240 mL) of cider vinegar and olive oil, and 1 tsp (approximately 1.6 g) of sugar, dill weed, black pepper, garlic salt, and table salt. Allow the marinade to soak the broccoli overnight in the refrigerator, and enjoy the myriad of flavors the next day."
