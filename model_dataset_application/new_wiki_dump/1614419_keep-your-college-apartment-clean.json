      "description":"If your oven doesn\u2019t have this, simply turn the oven to bake at the highest temperature possible and leave it on for about an hour. After the oven is cool, remove the racks and cover all surfaces with oven cleaner; use the whole can if you need to, it will be easier to clean, and you probably won\u2019t use the cleaner again until next semester anyway. Shut the oven door and leave the room while the fumes disperse, let the cleaner sit for a few minutes and then go back to wipe out the oven. Most of the black stuff that has been covering your oven all semester should come off pretty easy. If not, the only thing you can do is grab the steel wool and add in extra elbow grease."
