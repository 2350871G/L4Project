If the ball doesn't have a hole, just get a sharp needle or ice pick and poke it through the foam starting it off. Look for a embossed or engraved circle or a seam."

Form it into a complete circle by pinching the sewing region of the material where a thread was intended to sew it to a main material like a dress. It's either on the bottom or the center. Sequins, scallops, and eyelets make measuring easy. Count the number of these and add one or two more for good measure. If the material has layers just form one complete circle at the bottom. When the material forms the desired pompom, flower, or rosette design, cut the remainder of the material off and count the sections. This will be the length of the remaining strips used to create more flowers to cover the ball."

Just thread the wire through the material based on the designs or patterns of the material using best judgement. Others have this region in the center of the material. The wiring will be complete with wires coming out both ends of the trimming. Bring one wire end to the trimming end of the opposite end. Thread the wire through the bottom of the trimming, repeating the above procedures. The material will start to gather and scrunch up forming a doughnut when the material will not go any further or the wire reaches the end stop. Pull the two ends to the wire as tightly as possible. The material will twist and flip and form a tight center. Do a little experimenting and practicing to figure exactly how many loops can be threaded/skipped for a good result. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/21\\/Lace-SnowBall-Ornament-Flower-Form.jpg\\/460px-Lace-SnowBall-Ornament-Flower-Form.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/21\\/Lace-SnowBall-Ornament-Flower-Form.jpg\\/760px-Lace-SnowBall-Ornament-Flower-Form.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>Image by: Uploader<br>\\nLicense: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nLocate the wire ends and snip them as close to the center as possible.
