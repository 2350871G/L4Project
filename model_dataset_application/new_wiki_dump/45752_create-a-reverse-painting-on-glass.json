Use two 4-inch strips of masking tape to attach the traced image to a piece of white cardboard, larger than your glass pane. Place the strips over the top corners of the traced image. Attach the glass to the cardboard with small (2-inch) masking tape rings on the underside of the glass, so that you do not cover your painting surface with tape. As you handle the glass, consider wearing gloves to avoid leaving oily fingerprints on the glass face. Make sure the image is centered under the glass. Use white cardboard so that the lines from your image are visible and un-muddied by a dark color behind them."

You must use gilding size to help the paint adhere to and dry quicker on the glass. Pour a small amount of size directly onto your already-mixed paint and begin blending it in.

  "text":" Setting Up Your Glass Canvas Clean the sheet of glass. This glass will be your canvas for the image you want to paint. You should clean off this glass thoroughly and make sure that there aren't any scratches on it. Use fine grade sandpaper to sand the edges of the glass. This process will make the glass safe for you to handle while you're painting it and afterward. However, be careful not to scratch the glass. Clean the glass. Use a cotton rag to thoroughly clean and rinse the glass with an abrasive cleanser and warm water. After you clean it, make sure that there are no streaks in it. If there are streaks, wash it again. When you rinse and dry the glass, it should be perfectly clear. Acquire the image that you want to paint. Print it so that it is exactly the same size as your piece of glass.

You will need to paint in sections, allowing different areas time to dry. Drying typically takes 24 hours.
