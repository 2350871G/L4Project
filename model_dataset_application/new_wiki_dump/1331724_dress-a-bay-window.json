Deciding where to install the rods is the first step to getting a great window dressing. You can install the rods on the wooden frame of the window using brackets. You can install the rods underneath the wooden frame of the window by using tension rods pressed between the sides of the window frame. You can also install the rods above the window by using brackets attached to the wall. You can make the rods extend a bit wider than the window to create the illusion of a bigger window."

          "description":"To get curtains to look great on a bay window, it\u2019s important to get an accurate measuring of the windows. Use a tape measure to find the length and width of the windows. Start by measuring the width of the window to know how long the rods should be. Then measure the length of the window to determine the minimum length for the curtains. Write down the measurements on paper so can easily access them when you need them. Where you plan to install the rods determines how you measure the width of the windows. If you\u2019re planning on installing the rods on the window frame, measure the width of the top frame of the window. If you\u2019re planning on installing tension rods underneath the top frame, measure the width from the inside of one side\u2019s frame to the inside of the other side\u2019s frame. If you plan to install the rods on the wall above the window, measure the width from where you want one bracket to be to where you\u2019ll want the other. Try to have the rod extend the same amount outside each side of the window if you choose to install brackets on the wall. Make sure the tape measure runs straight across when you take measurements to ensure you get the most accurate measurement."
