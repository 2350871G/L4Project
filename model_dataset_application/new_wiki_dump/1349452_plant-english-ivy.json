If you plant ivy in an area that is not shaded during the heat of the day, provide the plant with a shade screen for the first 4 to 6 months. Ivy is an invasive plant, so pick an area where it has plenty of room to grow and will not interfere with other plants. Be absolutely certain you want to plant it, as it's invasive, considered a weed in many areas and not allowed in some. See Warnings below."
