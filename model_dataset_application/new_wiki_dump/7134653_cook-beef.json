          "description":"Cooking burgers on a grill or barbecue is a great way to give your burger a little extra flavor. Be sure to choose a ground beef with your desired fat content, add your desired ingredients and spices, and form your patties before placing them on a hot grill. Depending on how thick your patties are, grilling burgers can be relatively quick. Grilling burgers will also allow you to cook at a higher volume than you would on a stovetop or oven. Burgers can be cooked to any temperature, but they shouldn\u2019t take more than 10 minutes per side no matter how done they are. The more fat in your ground beef, the more flavor. Try starting with 80/20 fat to lean meat ratio. You can even grind your own beef for burgers. Some butchers will even grind specific cuts for you."

          "description":"Grilling steaks can be a great addition to a barbeque or cookout. Almost any cut of beef can be grilled on a barbeque and cooked to perfection. Choose whichever cut you prefer, from bone-in ribeyes to skirt steaks, season them with your desired spices and herbs, and place them on a hot grill. Cooking times on grill vary, especially between gas grills and charcoal grills. Use a meat thermometer in order to be certain of what temperature your steaks are. Steaks will be medium rare at 145F, medium at 160F, and well done at 170F."

          "description":"Kebabs are great dishes to be served at parties. Kebabs generally consist of cubed meat and a series of vegetables all skewered and grilled. You can use wood or metal skewers when making kebabs, although metal skewers will retain heat and wooden skewers may burn. Choose a cut of meat or purchase beef that is already cubed. Cubed beef is often top sirloin cut into small pieces, but feel free to experiment and use any cut you like. Simply place the meat on the skewer, add vegetables if you wish, and season with your desired spices before placing them on a hot grill. Kebabs will cook relatively quickly due to their size. Be sure to keep an eye on them so they don\u2019t overcook or burn. You\u2019ll generally only need to cook kebab meat around 2 minutes per side on a hot grill."

Knowing which dish you will be frying beef for will help determine the exact seasoning you will need. Place the beef and seasoning into the bowl and mix with your hands until the seasoning is fully incorporated. Place a skillet with oil over medium-high heat.

Break up any clumps of meat to ensure that all of the ground beef is cooked to the same temperature, will most likely be well-done. Use seasonings like thyme, fresh garlic, rosemary, salt, and pepper for more European style dishes, like lasagna, shepherd's pie, bolognese.

Once the oil is hot place one side of the steak down in the pan and sear for 2-3 minutes. Searing locks in the flavor of the steak as well as creates a \u201ccaramelized\u201d or heavily flavored crust. If your steak is large or thick you may need to finish it in the oven. Some thinner steaks, like flank steak or skirt steak, can be cooked quickly just by searing. Steak that come thicker or with edges that need to seared are T-bones, Porterhouses, New York strips, and Ribeyes. Let the steak rest on a cooling rack, cutting board, or plate for about 10 to fifteen minutes to let the steak finish cooking and reabsorb its juices."

For example, a 5.5 pound rib roast would take approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes in an oven at 350F to be medium rare. Cooking temperatures for beef are as follows: Rare (130F), Medium Rare (145F), Medium (160F), and Well Done (170F).

Push the thermometer approximately half way into the roast and wait until you get a reading. Medium rare reads at 145F, medium at 160F, and well done at 170F.
