If you don\u2019t have a bee suit and veil, wear thick clothing, long sleeves and pants, and gloves. Cover your head with a hood or hat, and avoid swatting at or otherwise aggravating any wasps you encounter. Leave the wasps alone as you track them, and try to notice if they show signs of agitation. If a swarm of wasps starts buzzing around in agitation, back away and cover your face. Walk away slowly if they're not near you, and run away if they swarm around you or start attacking."

You\u2019ll know you\u2019ve found the nest when you see dozens or hundreds of wasps flying in and around a specific spot. Most European wasp nests are underground, so you\u2019ll probably see wasps flying in and out of a small opening in the ground."

An outer insulating layer that resembles grey egg carton material distinguishes a European wasp nest from other wasp nests, in which honeycomb cells are clearly visible. Other wasps usually nest above ground. If you find an above-ground nest, check for the insulating layer. If you find an underground nest, it most likely was built by a European wasp colony."
