          "description":"Skillets are not only excellent for frying, but also for scrambling eggs, as well as saut\u00e9ing vegetables and meats. Buy an 8 in (20 cm) skillet if you're cooking for 1 or 2 people. But if you're frying for a household of 4 or more, buy a 12 in (30 cm) skillet. Certain types of skillets can also be used in the oven. If you're looking to roast beef or bake ham, buy a 12 in (30 cm) skillet. Consider a skillet with a riveted handle for sturdy construction."

          "description":"Look for one wide enough to accommodate your whisk so that you can stir food inside comfortably. Also, find one with large handles that allow you to pick up easily with oven mitts on. The standard size is 2 US qt (1.9 L) though you may want to purchase a 3 US qt (2.8 L) or larger size if you prepare large quantities of sauces, soups, or other liquid foods."

          "description":"Make sure your stockpot is sturdy and has wide enough handles to be able to lift it with your fingers protected by potholders or oven mitts. Buy an 8 US qt (7.6 L) for typical household use, though if you plan to prepare a lot of pasta, stews or, soups, a 12 US qt (11 L) to 18 US qt (17 L) stockpot may be better. Opt on the larger side (12 US qt (11 L) to 18 US qt (17 L)) if you plan to make dishes with large pieces of meat, such as whole chicken stew or corned beef and cabbage. You can buy a colander \u2013 used for straining water \u2013 as an insert if your existing stockpot doesn't have one. This will help you easily separate cooked pasta or steamed vegetables from the boiling water they were cooked in."

Find a saut\u00e9 pan with a thick base to ensure your food cooks evenly, as well as a tight-fitting lid to keep heat in and food moist. The saut\u00e9 pan is the most versatile of your cookware set as it can be used to prepare many types of meals. Use your saut\u00e9 pan to sear a cut of beef or brown chicken for extra flavor. Or use it for casseroles, chili, or curries."

You'll get a better price purchasing a set than the pieces individually. The pieces in a cookware set will also look uniform and be covered by the same warranty. Take stock of your existing inventory before deciding on a cookware set to avoid buying unnecessary dishes. Make a list of the pots and pans you already have. Be as detailed as possible. Note the sizes and material of the pot or pan on your list, as well as their condition. While not often thought of as conventional cookware, consider using this exercise to review the state of your other kitchen applies, like your utensils, measuring tools, blender, toaster, microwave, or food processor. If any of these items are in serious disrepair or in need of an upgrade, write this down too."

To expand the range of dishes you'll be able to prepare, supplement those pots and pans with other cookware items many consider indispensable. These include:\nDutch ovens: These pots can be used on a stovetop or in an oven and are often used to prepare soups, stews, or braised foods. Baking sheets or sheet pans: Use these for foods you'll cook in batches like cookies and biscuits. Glass baking pans: Bake macaroni and cheese, pasta dishes, marinated meats, and casseroles in these sturdy Pyrex pans. Pie pans: Purchase standard-size (9 in (23 cm)) glass pie pans to prepare quiches and pies."

Stainless steel cookware is also highly scratch and warp resistant."

Buy copper pots and pans coated in enamel to avoid any after taste or discoloration when cooking acidic foods."

It is also relatively inexpensive compared to aluminum and copper cookware. However, it also rusts easily, is difficult to clean and is very heavy. Look for cast iron cookware with aluminum or copper cladding. Cladding is a layer of metal along the sides and base of the pot. By layering the sides and base with aluminum or copper, a cladded cast iron pot obtains the heat conductivity of those metals. Because cast iron cookware is vulnerable to rust, hand scouring is necessary to pots and pans made of this material. Avoid picking it if you'd rather put your cookware in a dishwasher."
