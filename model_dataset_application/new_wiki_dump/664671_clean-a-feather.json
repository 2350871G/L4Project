Add your feathers and seal the container. Keep the container outside and give the mothballs at least 24 hours to kill any possible parasites on the feathers. To be effective, make sure you use mothballs that list paradichlorobenzene as an ingredient."

Hold them there for a few minutes, which will kill any germs present. Lay them out flat on paper towels to dry. If boiling loosened up any unidentifiable gunk on the quills, wipe them gently with a soft cloth to remove it."
