      "description":"These are the basic tools for drawing, and depending on the artistic quality, they can range from simple and inexpensive, to professional grade. Pencils come in different strengths. For dark, wide lines, use the soft grade pencils, like 1B <lighter darkest=\"\">6b, and for fine, light lines, harder leaded pencils, H1<darker lightest=\"\">H6. For sketching, an \"HB\", or common number 2 pencil is fine. Paper, as well, comes in different stocks, grades, types, and weights. Newsprint is a cheap, light sketching paper, but does not tolerate much erasing (without tearing) and is usually not suitable for matting and framing. 20# drawing paper is a basic, inexpensive sketch pad paper, fine for doodling, sketching, or even matting and framing. For practice, regular computer printer paper will work."

Add smaller petals on top of the others. Again you will need to rub out extra lines that are hidden because of petals overlapping. When/If colouring, make the petals in the center a darker shade of yellow than the ones at the back."
