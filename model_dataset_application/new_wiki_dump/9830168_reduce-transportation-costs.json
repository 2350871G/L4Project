          "description":"Trade in your truck, SUV, or sporty show car for a more sensible model. One of the biggest benefits of compact cars is that they typically enjoy far better mileage than oversized gas-guzzlers. What you sacrifice in flash or legroom, you\u2019ll make up for on your monthly fuel expenditure. Restricting your search to slightly used cars (less than about five years old) can help you save hundreds more on your initial purchase while ensuring that you get a vehicle that runs the way it\u2019s supposed to. Hybrid vehicle types are by far the cheapest to refill. However, their steep price tags may cancel out their exception fuel-efficiency for some."

          "description":"Bring your car in for a tune-up every 30,000-50,000 miles, and make sure you\u2019re up to date on oil changes, tire rotations, and other important routine maintenance. Regular inspections will help you identify potential issues before they degenerate into a more expensive problem. Shelling out for a new set of windshield wipers, for instance, doesn\u2019t compare to the price you\u2019d pay for repairs after running off an embankment due to poor visibility. Keeping your tires properly inflated alone can improve your vehicle\u2019s fuel economy by up to 3%."

          "description":"Before hitting the road, take a few extra minutes to figure out how to get where you\u2019re going in the least amount of time. As much as possible, avoid construction zones and areas where traffic tends to get congested during prime commuting hours. The longer you\u2019re behind the wheel, the more fuel you\u2019ll burn, and the more wear your car will collect. Depending on where you live, streamlining your navigation could mean taking a straight shot down the highway or interstate, or it could mean familiarizing yourself with seldom-used back roads. Use your smartphone\u2019s GPS anytime you\u2019re driving somewhere new. Most satellite GPS systems are programmed to automatically select the most direct known course."

Going faster may seem like a good idea if your goal is to spend less time on the road, but it takes a lot more fuel to floor it than it does to cruise along at a responsible speed. Relax, pace yourself, and enjoy the ride. Driving too fast also puts you at risk of getting slapped with a ticket, which will just drain your bank account even more."

Each of you can then take turns driving the rest of the group to the places you all need to be. With a large enough carpool, you might make the same drive a fraction of the number of times you would in an ordinary week. Carpools work best when everyone involved lives and goes to work, school, or practice within a short distance of one another. Take advantage of the slightly longer commute time by getting some unfinished work done or catching up on your reading."

Not only will one of these methods of mass transit get you where you\u2019re going faster since they stick to more direct routes, they usually only cost a few dollars per trip. As such, they can be a major time and money saver if most of your business is confined to the downtown area. The average price of bus fare in most cities is around $2.50. If you have a lot of stops to make throughout the day, an all-day pass will only run you a couple dollars more than standard fare."

Many gas-powered scooters get up to 100 miles per gallon, making them one of the most fuel-efficient vehicles on the road if you\u2019re not in a huge hurry. What\u2019s more, you\u2019re practically guaranteed to find parking wherever you go, since they take up so little space. It only costs about $10 to top off a gas-powered scooter, which is roughly a quarter as much as the average car or truck. Ride responsibly\u2014always wear a helmet and keep an eye out for other motorists."

Going from four wheels to two is especially practical if you live in a big city, with paved bike lanes and a convenient, sensible street layout. You can bring home a roadworthy bicycle that will carry you for thousands of miles for less than it costs to repair a busted transmission."

Consider going on foot whenever you\u2019re headed someplace nearby, like the corner store or campus library. It may be slower compared to driving or taking the bus, but it costs you nothing, and it\u2019s great exercise, to boot. Walking gives you the freedom to go more places than you could in an automobile, as it permits you to take shortcuts and plod along without having to worry about traffic jams or road closures. Longer treks will be more time-consuming, so be sure to plot out your path in advance and allow yourself plenty of time to reach your destination."

A lengthy car ride can present a great opportunity for you to catch up on what\u2019s been going on in each other\u2019s lives. Don\u2019t rely on the people you know to cart you around. It\u2019s one thing to bum a ride from a friend every now and then, but if you do it too often, they may come to see you as a burden."

Peak shipping days differ depending on the industry, but they tend to be fairly consistent between competitors.
