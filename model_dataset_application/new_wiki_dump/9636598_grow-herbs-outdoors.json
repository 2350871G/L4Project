Research different providers and read customer reviews to help you make your choice. Make sure the seeds are not discolored, misshapen, or show signs of rot, mold or other issues before planting them. Some herbs don\u2019t transplant well and should be grown from seed, including fennel, cumin, anise, chervil, dill, borage, caraway, parsley, and cilantro/coriander."

          "headline":"Select sites with good drainage.",
          "description":"It\u2019s important that the area in which you plant herbs has good drainage so they don\u2019t become waterlogged. Inspect your soil after heavy rainfall or watering. If puddles or patches of water remain on top of the soil after several hours, your soil is not well-draining. To amend your existing soil, you can dig up the top 12 inches (30 cm) of soil in the area you will plant the herbs. Mix 25% sand, compost, or peat into the soil, then use the mixture to fill in the area. If you\u2019re planting your herbs in containers and placing them outdoors, select a soil with good drainage, such as one that contains vermiculite or sand.

Steve Masley\t\t\tOrganic Vegetable Gardener\t\t\t\tConsider using additives if your native soil isn't ideal. Steve Masley and Pat Browne, owners of Grow it Organically, say: \"If you're working on a heavy clay-based soil, you need to make it more porous so the water and air can penetrate. That allows the microorganisms to go further and deeper into the soil, and that's when good things happen. And if you have sandy soil, where you put a hose on it and water just drains right through, then you need to add a lot of organic matter to the soil. And for really hot, sandy soil, I also like to add biochar, which soaks up a lot of moisture and adds a lot of microbial surface areas so the soil organisms have something to cling to.\""

Read the seed packet or plant label to find out how much space each herb needs. If you\u2019re using containers, choose ones that are larger than 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter so the herbs don\u2019t become too cramped.
