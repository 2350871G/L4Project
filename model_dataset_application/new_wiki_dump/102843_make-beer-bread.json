Any kind of flour, from whole wheat, to self-rising white is fine to use. Cheap beer and expensive beer also work perfectly well. Use a lighter beer if you're not a big beer fan, and a darker beer if you want more flavor. All in all, you'll need the following ingredients to make beer bread:\n2 \u00be cups baking flour\n2 tbsp sugar\n2 tbsp baking powder\n\u00bd tsp salt\n1-2 tsp. dried green herbs (optional)\n1 12 oz. can or bottle of beer"

Remove the bread when the edges are golden brown, or crisp looking. Check using a knife or a toothpick in the middle. If it comes back without any wet dough on it, it's done."

While fruity or flavored beers might be a little funky in a bread recipe, it's fine to use any beer you like to drink, or whatever's in the fridge. Light pilsners, like most domestic Budweiser and Coors, are good for beer bread because they're cheap and easy to find. They don't leave much flavor, but some subtle yeastiness, making them great to use if you've got any laying around. Wheat beers, like Blue Moon, are already quite bread-like to begin with, making them a great addition to a beer bread recipe. Dark beers, like brown ales, porters, and stouts will leave a sweet nuttiness in the bread that a lot of people like. It'll also make the bread darker. The baking process burns off any traces of alcohol from the beer, but leaves some of the flavor from the malts, sugars, and yeasts in the beer, making this treat a perfect side for people of all ages. No worries about feeding beer bread to youngsters."
