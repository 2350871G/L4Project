          "description":"Place a large rug on the floor of your living room, which should run vertically down one of the rectangular pieces of your L-shape. This will connect your couches, chairs, and loveseats. Position one couch on the south end of the carpet and another along the west end a bit to the south, perpendicular to the first couch. Place a loveseat facing the carpet inward from the northeast corner (diagonal from the corner that your two couches intersect at). Place a tall plant in the corner connecting the two sofas. This softens the hard edge of the corner and adds visual height to the layout. For a more open feel, place a sofa on one end of the room and two chairs opposite it."

          "description":"Treat the two arms of the L-shape as two separate spaces, such as a living room and dining room. Avoid scattered pieces of furniture that lack flow. Keep your living room furniture close enough to accommodate conversation. Minimize spaces between the walls and your furniture to tighten up the layout. If you need to increase the space between the wall and back of the sofa, use a sofa table to separate them. This is especially useful for tightening up conversation areas. To pull everything together, add side tables and coffee tables that complement the furniture."

For example, connect a medium gray with coral using pale gray. Add solid gray drapes in the coral area and coral-themed pillows in the gray region. If you want to avoid painting, use identical flooring to connect the two rooms. Be sure to complementary, not contrasting, colors."

For example, you have a couch against the south wall of your living area, and to the east is your dining room table. Place a screen in between the two to break up the blank wall space and separate the two regions of your L.\nUse screens taller than other elements of your space to create height variation.

Avoid pulling too much attention to one side of the room by separating these elements. For example, place your fireplace and TV armoire on different walls whenever possible. If you can't separate them on different walls, use plants or small carpets to define the areas. For example, a small carpet underneath your TV and/or a plant in the corner closest to your fireplace can define each of these spaces and make them feel separate, even when you're forced to place them on the same wall.
