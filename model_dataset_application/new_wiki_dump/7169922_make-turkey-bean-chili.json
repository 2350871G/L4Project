Stack the slices on top of each other or lay them flat beside each other. Now, cut them into strips, and then cut the strips into equal sized dice. Hold the top of your knife steady with your non-dominant hand. For small diced tomatoes, cut the slices close together. For thicker dice, cut them farther apart.

Always remove the onion's skin before cutting. Don't cut all the way through the onion during the first round of cuts.
