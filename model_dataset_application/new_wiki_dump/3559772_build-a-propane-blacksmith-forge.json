Heat a scrap metal file as hot as it can go. If it turns white and 'burns,' the forge is efficient enough to faggot-weld with. If it does not reach this temperature, it is fine. Try faggot-welding two rods together using borax."

Questions like this are based on what you want to make or work with, as well as the amount of use the forge. Make a tentative plan. Take the goals and decide on these factors: Number of burners, size of forge, amount of usage, budget, short-cuts (do you already have a major component of a forge? ), etcetera. Where the forge will be built and operated is important (this forge must be operated outdoors). Finalize the plan. Create a parts list as based on forge design. Affirm \"blueprints\" as to what the forge will be, part by part, and based on size. Gather parts. This can be done progressively as you make your way building components. You can build a gas forge with a $0 budget, but you'll need to scavenge parts. Building the Forge Build the forge body. There are two major ends of the gas forge, which are the body and the burners. The body can be any metal container such as an air tank or 5 gallon (18.9 L) paint can. This needs to be lined with an insulating layer.
