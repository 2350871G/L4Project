          "description":"Hold one end of a measuring tape to the bolts at the back of the seat that secure it to the bowl. Draw the other end of the tape to the very tip of the front of the bowl, then note the seat\u2019s length. Be sure to take your measurement down the center of the bowl. For an accurate measurement, hold the measuring tape in line with the centers of the bolts. If necessary, snap up the plastic covers so you can see the bolts. If you can\u2019t pry up the covers with your fingers, use a flat-head screwdriver. Picture the toilet seat as a clock. Measure the length from the center of each side, or from 12 o\u2019clock to 6 o\u2019clock.Tip: Write down your measurements and take them with you to the hardware store, especially if you have an old or non-standard toilet."

          "description":"If flaps cover the bolts and you haven\u2019t lifted them, pry them up with your fingers or a flat-head screwdriver. Then measure the bolt spread, or the length between the centers of the mounting bolts. In the U.S., the standard bolt spread is 5 \u20442 in (14 cm), but there are a few models with spreads of 7 to 10 in (18 to 25 cm). If your toilet\u2019s dimensions aren\u2019t standard, you may need to order a seat directly from the manufacturer. In Europe, the standard bolt spread is approximately 6 to 6 \u20442 in (15 to 17 cm)."
