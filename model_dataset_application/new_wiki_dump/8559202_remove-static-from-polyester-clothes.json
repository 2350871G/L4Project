To help minimize static, add a couple of dryer sheets to your tumble dryer. As the sheets heat up, they release and oil that then lightly coats the polyester clothing. This lubrication helps minimize the amount of friction, which reduces static cling. Be sure to dry polyester garments at a low temperature."

As they move around, the balls help separate the clothing and expose them to the dry air. This separation also reduces friction, thereby minimizing static. Dryer balls aren\u2019t as effective if they are added to a large load of clothes. Make sure you only add them to small and medium loads so they have room to move around. Add three large dryer balls per load. If you don't have a dryer ball, add a tennis ball or two to your tumble dryer to get the same effect."
