  "text":" Preparing the fabric Choose suitable fabric that is waterproof or water resistant.  Cut 2 pieces of the said fabric. The pieces should each measure 75-1/4 inches (191 cm) long. Fold 1 panel in half lengthwise. Cut along the fold to create 2 narrower panels. Sewing the fabric Sew a narrow panel along each of the long sides of the wider panel so that the wide panel is in the center with the narrow panels on either side. Press the seams open. Fold the fabric in half lengthwise. Measure 37-1/4 inches (94.62 cm) from the fold and mark or pin every few inches along the entire length of the fabric in order to make sure you're marking the same width at all points. Pin the fabric together near the markings to hold both pieces together. Cut the excess fabric so that when opened, the entire shower curtain measures 74-1/2 inches (189.23 cm) wide.  Fold under 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) on each side. Press. Then fold under another 3/4 inch (1.91 cm) to the wrong side of the fabric on each side. Press. Stitch close to the inside fold along both edges. Press. Sew the bottom hem of the shower curtain in the same manner as the sides.  Fold under 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) on the top edge of the shower curtain. Press. Then fold another 2 inches (5.08 cm) to the wrong side of the fabric. Press. Stitch close to the bottom of the 2 inch (5.08 cm) hem. Adding the liner and grommets Lay the shower curtain liner on top of the fabric, making sure to line up the top and side edges. Use a fabric marker to place a mark indicating the location of each of the shower curtain hook holes in the liner on the fabric. Use sharp scissors to make 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) vertical cuts at each position marked. Be sure to cut through all layers of fabric. Insert the front piece of a grommet through each slit so that the shaft portion of each grommet is passed through to the wrong side of the shower curtain.  Lay the shower curtain, right side down, on a large, flat, clean surface. Place the back piece of a grommet over the front piece. Insert the grommet tool into the center of the grommet. Use a hammer to flatten the grommet shaft over the back piece of the grommet following the instructions on the packaging. Repeat the process until all grommets have been attached. Hanging the shower curtain Place the shower curtain liner over the shower curtain. Make sure the right side of the liner faces the wrong side of the shower curtain. Line up the grommets with the shower curtain hook holes in the liner. Insert shower curtain rings through both. Hang the shower curtain and liner together on a shower curtain rod. ",
