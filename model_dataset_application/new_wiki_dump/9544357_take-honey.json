The warmth is soothing to the throat and it keeps you hydrated, which keeps mucus thinner. By adding a teaspoon or so of honey to a cup of tea or hot water you can help ease discomfort and boost your immune system at the same time. To make your honey and hot water mixture taste even better, add a teaspoon of lemon juice as well. This will help to balance out the sweetness of the drink."

This will help you avoid experiencing severe symptoms because it will limit the irritation you experience over the course of your illness. Taking honey from the onset of symptoms can help you cope with them but will not always eliminate them all together."

Adding honey to a warm cup of tea can ease your symptoms and help you get in the mood to go to sleep. However, add honey to a tea that promotes sleep, such as chamomile or other caffeine-free herbal teas. Drinking a caffeinated tea could cause you to have trouble sleeping."

While honey does contain a variety of healthy minerals and vitamins that sugar does not, it is sweeter than sugar and will still make your blood sugar increase. Check with your doctor before taking honey if they have blood sugar concerns. Honey is sweeter than regular sugar because it contains more of a sweeter simple sugar, fructose, than regular sugar does. This means that it takes less honey to sweeten things than it does with regular sugar. In general, using half a teaspoon of honey will produce the same amount of sweetness as a teaspoon of sugar would."
