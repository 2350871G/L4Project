      "headline":"Set up the door and window sensors.",
      "description":"Doors and windows are vulnerable areas of your house or apartment through which a burglar can break in. Once you attach these sensors the corner of your doors or windows, they'll be able to detect whenever your access points are open. Your door and window sensors keep you safe when you're at home during the day and moving around your house. The door sensor comes in 2 pieces \u2013 the bigger half is a wireless transmitter and the tinier piece is a magnet that completes the circuit. As soon as the door unlocks, the circuit is broken & an alarm jingles. As a substitute, you can put a motion sensor in every room, and then if anybody attempts to get in via the window, an alarm will be transmitted to the control panel."

      "headline":"Set up the motion sensors.",
      "description":"Motion sensors serve a slightly different role: protecting your home when you're asleep or not physically inside it. Passive infrared motion sensors operate by sensing a change in temperature. Avoid pointing them in the direction of windows where the heat of the glass varies throughout cold and hot periods. Though these sensors employ infrared technology to distinguish body temperature, small dogs will not have an effect on their function since the sensors aren't efficient enough to identify a body weighing less than forty pounds. Consider using door and window contacts instead if you have a large dog or cat, as these might trip motion sensors. To set up the motion detector, 1st pick a location with a clear sight of the whole room. Utilize the mounting plate as a pattern to mark navigator holes, and affix the sensor to a firm base \u2013 employ drywall anchors in empty wallboard."

Pursue the system's programming methods cautiously \u2013 if you make any error, you may have to do again the whole progression. As soon as the system is programmed, it'll jingle an alarm if a sensor is triggered, and it'll call to aware you. Turn on the window and door sensors while you move to bed, or depart the home. The water detector, freeze detector and smoke detector are always triggered. Several systems offer a keyfob remote control that users can carry and utilize to trigger the system with just a tap of a switch. Also make sure that you set up monitoring so that you can get a response. Popular monitoring solutions include ADT, SimpliSafe, Ring, Nest, etc."
