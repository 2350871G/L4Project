Doing this will help to prevent the urine from getting absorbed into the carpet or flooring\u2019s deeper layers. Urine that has been absorbed into the deeper layer will create an odor that will be very hard to get rid of. If you do not have a vacuum cleaner, lay several sheets of newspaper or paper towels down on the spot. This is best to do right after the dog has urinated. Remove the soaked paper and replace with new sheets until it seems like the paper is not soaking up anymore urine. This will help to keep the urine from sinking deep down into the carpet."

Once you\u2019ve found the spots, mark them by placing an object next to them so you don\u2019t lose them again. Cheap UV lights can generally be bought at your local home goods or hardware store."

When washing urine off of concrete, use three times the amount of neutralizer. For instance, if your dog passed roughly one-fourth a cup of urine, you would use three-fourths cup of neutralizer. When treating carpets that have been heavily soiled with urine on multiple occasions, it is best to lift the carpet up and clean the floor as well. If you do not, there is a good chance that the odor will continue to linger. If you are treating a car seat, use double the amount of neutralizer to account for the fact that the foam in car seats is much more absorbent that most carpets and floorings."
