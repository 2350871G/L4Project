          "description":"Lemons are the main source of flavor in limoncello, so it\u2019s important to pick ripe and flavorful ones. Also, because the zest will be soaking in the alcohol, it\u2019s best to choose lemons that have been grown without pesticides and haven't been waxed. To determine if a lemon is ripe, gently press it with your thumb. If the lemon gives a little, that\u2019s a sign that it\u2019s juicy and ready to eat. Choose lemons with smooth rind, because this will make them easier to peel. Most lemon lovers opt for Meyer lemons whenever possible, because they're sweeter, less acidic, and have a more complex flavor than other lemons."

          "description":"To make limoncello, you'll need a vegetable peeler, large jar with a tight-fitting lid, fine-mesh strainer, coffee filter, large bowl, small saucepan, funnel, and three to four sterile bottles for storing. To accommodate the lemon zest and the alcohol, use at least a 1-quart (946 ml) jar. If you don\u2019t have a vegetable peeler, you can also use a microplane grater, zester, or a knife. Instead of a coffee filter, you can also use cheesecloth. For storage, you need a bottle or bottles that can hold about 60 ounces (1.8 L) of liquid. Clean wine bottles work well, but make sure you have a clean lid or cork to seal the bottle."

          "description":"Remove any fruit stickers that are on the lemons and peel off any sticker residue. Hold the lemons under clean running water and scrub the rinds with a vegetable brush or clean toothbrush. Pat the lemons dry with a clean towel. The lemon zests will be soaking in alcohol, so you need the lemons as clean as possible. Otherwise, any dirt, residue, or pesticides left on the lemon rind will infuse into the alcohol."

          "description":"Remove all the zest from the lemons by peeling off long strips of the yellow zest with the vegetable peeler. Don\u2019t peel too deeply, or you'll end up with pith (the white part) on the zest, and this will make the limoncello bitter. If you do get some pith with the zest, cut it off with a knife. To use a microplane grater or zester, remove a thin layer of zest from around the entire lemon. You only need the zest to make limoncello, but you can reserve the remaining portion of the lemons for juicing, baking, or lemonade."

The best vodka for limoncello has a high alcohol content (at least 80-proof in the U.S. and 40% in Australia and the UK)."

The longer you let the alcohol infuse, the bolder and stronger the lemon flavor will be. Also, the longer you leave in the lemons, the more yellow and golden the vodka will become."

Line a fine-mesh strainer with either a coffee filter or cheesecloth, and position the strainer over a large bowl. Pour the contents of the jar into the strainer and let the vodka drain through into the bowl. If the strainer gets blocked and the liquid stops flowing, stir the mixture in the strainer to move the lemons around."

When it boils, reduce the heat to medium and let it simmer for 3 minutes. After 3 minutes, remove the pan from the heat and let the syrup cool completely for about an hour. Simple syrup traditionally combines equal parts water and sugar, but this limoncello recipe uses more water."
