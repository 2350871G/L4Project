Find a time when you can have a full week without extra responsibilities. Mark  your calendar so that you stay accountable to yourself. If you are always busy and can\u2019t find a low-stress week, you may need to wean yourself off, instead of quitting cold turkey. Vacation can be a great time to quit coffee.

If they know you\u2019re in the process of detoxing, they won\u2019t take it personally. If other people in your household drink coffee, ask if they can avoid making or drinking it around you. Your family can help you stay on track. Ask for their support. Tell them that if your resolve weakens, they should encourage you to stay away from coffee."

Tell your coworkers (and even your boss) that you\u2019re in the process of quitting coffee. They\u2019ll likely understand and be sympathetic. If your workplace offers free coffee throughout the day (for example, if you work in a restaurant or a busy office) let your coworkers know that you\u2019ll be avoiding it. Bring something with you to replace coffee you would otherwise be drinking. Seltzer water or lemon water is great to sip on throughout the day and keeps you hydrated."
