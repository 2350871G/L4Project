          "description":"Think about what you want to do and how long it will take. For example, if you need to plan an outfit and shave your beard, you may only need an hour or so. However, if you want to do makeup and style your hair, you will need as much time as you can get. If you\u2019re on a time crunch, try to do some things ahead of time. For example:\nPlan your outfit the day before. Do your hair before you go to work or school. If you dye your hair, touch up your roots a few days in advance."

          "description":"A large part of looking great is being clean. While you shower, complete any other grooming activities, such as shaving your legs, exfoliating your skin, or touching up your roots with hair dye. Remember to apply deodorant after showering. Other shower grooming activities include:\nConditioning your hair to give it a silky shine\nTaking a bath to help you relax for the party\nScrubbing your skin with a loofah to rub away dead skin"

          "headline":"Moisturize your skin.",
          "description":"After showering, cover your skin with moisturizer to make your skin glow and repair any damaged skin cells. This step is especially important if you like taking hot showers or if you have recently exfoliated your skin. Additionally, wait thirty minutes after moisturizing to apply any makeup or it may slide off. If you\u2019ve shaved your legs, moisturize with baby oil to give them a glamorous shine. If your face is oily, use a special moisturizer for acne-prone skin. For special occasions, consider using a tinted or shimmering moisturizer."

          "description":"If you have long hair, you may need to blow dry it before styling it. If you have short hair, you can let it air dry. If you don\u2019t know how to style your hair, there are many helpful YouTube videos that will teach you how. Alternatively, if you\u2019re attending an especially formal event, consider getting your hair styled professionally. To straighten your hair, you will need a blow dryer, a brush, a straightening iron, and soft styling spray. If you want to curl your hair, you will need curlers or a curling iron and some setting hairspray. Men can style their hair with pomade or gel for a finished look."

When doing your makeup, apply the foundation first, seal it with a layer of powder, and then add any enhancements such as blush or mascara. You can also enhance particular features on your face. For example:\nTo highlight your eyes, wear liquid eyeliner. If you want to enhance your lips, wear a bold lipstick. To emphasize smooth skin, wear a high-quality foundation."

Next, trim your nails and file the sharp edge off the ends. If you like using nail polish, choose a bold color that will compliment your makeup and outfit. You can paint your nails at home or visit a nail salon."

Women with a pear body shape should accentuate their upper bodies with flowing tops. Men with an inverted triangle body shape should wear tailored clothing that shows off their shoulders. Women with a rectangle body shape should wear heels and short skirts to accentuate their legs."

First, look at the veins in your arm. If they appear blue, you have a cool skin tone. If they appear green, you have a warm skin tone. If they seem to be some color in between, you may have a neutral skin tone. Cool skin tones can wear cooler toned blue, greens, silver, and purple well. Warm skin tones look best in earthy colors such as brown, deep yellow, gold, and red. Neutral skin tones look good in both cool and warm colors."

Therefore, if you want to have a good time at a party, wear something that makes you feel comfortable and attractive. Avoid wearing anything that makes you feel awkward. Otherwise, you may come across as awkward at the party. For example, if your shirt rides up every few minutes, it may be hard to wear comfortably at a party. If your shoes hurt when you try them on, they will only get worse once you get to the party. Instead, choose shoes that are comfortable to stand in. If the dress you\u2019re wearing is cute but makes you feel weird, wear something else. You won\u2019t look comfortable in your own skin if you wear it."
