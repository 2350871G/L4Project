Once the butter and water has started to simmer, add the gluten-free pastry flour. Stir the mixture until it forms a thick dough. Then remove it from the heat and allow the dough to cool for about three minutes. This recipe will make about 20 puffs. You can also make your own gluten-free pastry flour blend by mixing together three cups (435 g) of white rice flour, 1 \u00bd cups (187 g) of tapioca, \u00be cup (123 g) of potato starch, one tablespoon (8 g) of xantham, and 1 \u00bd teaspoons (5 g) of salt."

You can also mix the dough in a standing mixer or with a hand mixer if you do not have a food processor."

Then squirt about 20 small mounds of dough, roughly 1 \u00bd inches (3.81 cm) high, onto a greased baking tray or piece of parchment paper. Try to leave at least an inch (2.54 cm) between each pastry. To keep the tops from burning, you might wet your finger and smooth down the tops of each pastry before you put them in the oven. You can also use ice cream scoops to get more uniform-sized puffs."

Once the pastries are ready, place them in your oven on the center rack. Bake the pastries for about 10 minutes or until they are golden brown. Once they are done baking, slice a small slit in the side of the pastry to allow moisture to escape and let them cool. You can remove the pastries from the oven to let them cool or you can turn off the oven and leave the pastries in it to cool very gradually."
