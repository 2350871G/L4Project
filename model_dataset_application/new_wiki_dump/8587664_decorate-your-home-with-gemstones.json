          "description":"A crystal can be the focal point of a room. Buy a large, raw crystal or other mineral that appeals to you. Keep in mind that they can be costly. Once you have chosen the crystal, place it on the center of a table in whatever room you\u2019d like. A living room, sitting area, or dining room are ideal places. You can put the crystal directly on the table, or on a tray or pedestal. The crystal will stand out more if it is the only item on the table. The crystal doesn\u2019t have to be overwhelmingly big. It just needs to be big enough to attract attention."

You can find display cases at many arts and crafts stores and interior design stores. You can choose plan glass display cases or one that are lined in silver or gold. Make sure the case is big enough to easily fit over the gemstone. Some popular gemstones you can choose to display are citrines, aquamarines, emeralds, and rubies. You can put one large, gemstone in a case or several small ones. Put the display case somewhere it can be easily seen and admired, like in an office or over a fireplace."

You can buy a mineral that is made to be a planter, or you can use a raw mineral that has a hole big enough to put the plant inside of it. Succulents typically work and look best with mineral planters. Amethyst crystal planters are popular and fairly easy to find."

For gemstone vases, it is easier to find a simple vase with gemstones attached to it. For example, you can find a gemstone with a selection of small gemstones, like, turquoise, attached to it. You can put the vase out as the centerpiece on a table, or place it on a side table. Alternatively, simply scatter a few gemstones around a vase."

You can buy a classy and graceful lamp with a polished mineral base, like marble, or a raw mineral that has been attached to vase. You can find traditional lamps, or a table lamp for your desk. For instance, place a pink Himalayan salt lamp on your nightstand for a soothing and soft glow."

Using real gemstones can be costly, so you can find fake gemstones to attach to the coaster at art and crafts stores.

If you want to use them in a subtle way, put a few books in between the bookends within a bookshelf. For a more obvious use, place some of your favorite books between the bookends in the center of a table. Quartz bookends dipped in gold are a great way to achieve an organic and classy look."

Choose a high table or a prominent space in your home. Put out things like gemstones, minerals, rocks, flowers, ribbons, and whatever you think represents the season. Feel free to use few or many items, depending on your preference. For fall, put out gemstones in colors like green, red, orange, and black, fake seasonal vegetables, and any other items that are representative of fall for you. Rubies and onyx are good to use for fall. For winter, put together light colored gemstones, items representative of the winter holiday you celebrate, and white glittery ribbons. Pearls and turquoise are good to use for winter. For spring, set out out pastel colored gemstones, fresh flowers, and items that remind you or renewal and growth. Rose quartz and moonstones look nice for a spring altar. For summer, put out things like earthy colored gemstones, like topaz and jade, and sunflowers. You can use a single, large gemstone, or a pretty bowl full of smaller gemstones."
