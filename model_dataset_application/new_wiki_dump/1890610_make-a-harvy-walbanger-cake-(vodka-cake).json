  "text":" Make the Batter As you preheat your oven to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) (180 C), spray a 9-cup (2 liter) Bundt pan with nonstick cooking spray.  Combine the sugar, butter and salt in a mixing bowl. Mix them together using a mixer with a flat paddle attachment. Beat in the oil and vanilla.  Beat in the eggs, one at a time, until well combined.  In another bowl, combine the flour, cornstarch and baking powder using a whisk.  Combine the orange juice, Galliano liqueur, vodka and 1 tablespoon (4 grams) of orange zest in a measuring cup. If the liquid is cold, then microwave it for 30 seconds to bring it to room temperature. Add 1/3 of the flour mixture to the mixing bowl that contains the butter mixture. Mix the flour mixture in until you can no longer see the dry ingredients. Using a flat plastic spatula, scrape the bowl to make sure that none of the dry ingredients have drifted to the bottom.  Add the other tablespoon of fresh orange zest to the mixture.  Add half of the vodka mixture and blend it in well.  Add another 1/3 of the flour mixture to the bowl. Mix it in and scrape the bowl. Add the rest of the vodka mixture to the bowl and blend it in well.  Finish by mixing in the remainder of the flour mixture and scrape off the sides of the bowl with your spatula if you need to.  Bake and Plate the Cake Transfer the batter to the Bundt pan and smooth out the top using the back of a tablespoon.  Bake the cake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the cake comes out clean.  Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 20 minutes. It will have cooled down just enough to be warm to the touch, but not oven-hot. Once the cake is cooled, use a butter knife or a plastic spatula to gently separate the cake from the sides of the pan.  Place an inverted cake plate on the top of your Bundt pan. Using a cake stand might make this action difficult for one person to complete alone. Flip the cake plate and the Bundt pan over until the cake plate is resting on the counter with the inverted Bundt pan on top.  Gently lift the Bundt pan to release the cake. If the cake doesn\u2019t dislodge from the pan easily, tap the inverted Bundt pan a few times with your hand and try again. Add the Glaze and Serve Combine the confectioner\u2019s sugar, orange juice, Galliano liqueur and vodka in a bowl using a whisk. The glaze will be thick. Drizzle the glaze over the top of the Bundt pan using a tablespoon, moving in a circle around the top of the cake.  When the cake has cooled entirely, cut the cake with a cake slicer or a butter knife and serve it.  Cover the cake in plastic wrap once the glaze has set, and store it either at room temperature or in the refrigerator. Make sure that the plastic wrap is in contact with the cut sides; this will keep the cut sides from drying out. Finished. ",
