Use your time in school to take classes that will help you succeed as a fabricator. Check with your school to see if they have any work-study or apprenticeship programs that will allow you to get a jumpstart on your career.The GED is considered to be the equivalent of a high school education. If you don\u2019t finish high school, take the GED test instead to qualify for more opportunities. While you\u2019re in school, talk with a counselor or academic advisor to ensure you\u2019re taking the best possible steps to prepare for work as a fabricator."

Geometry and trigonometry are also helpful when you\u2019re calculating how to arrange and combine different pieces of metal.Since the math can be complicated, get some experience with it before training for employment. You can then get additional experience through a metal fabrication program or apprenticeship."

          "description":"Most fabricators work in teams. As a fabricator, you must be able to work well with people, whether they\u2019re team members, supervisors, or customers. Take language and communications classes to prepare. Also, search for volunteer opportunities that put you into direct contact with customers and other volunteers.You might have multiple people arranging and welding different parts of the same project, for instance. If no one is on the same page, you could end up with flawed products that are unsafe for use. Reading comprehension is also important since fabricators have to interpret blueprint designs and convey the details to team members. Some fabricators are even responsible for communicating with customers. You may be asked to determine a customer\u2019s needs and make sure they are satisfied."

Get accustomed to handling joining tools like welding torches and soldering irons. Also, read about workshop operations and the tools used to keep everything running, such as riveters, formation machines, cleat folders, and power presses.If you are able to, visit a workshop for some first-hand experience on how it operates. Ask to shadow a professional fabricator for a day. Research various metals and the techniques used to turn them into commercial products. You don\u2019t have to learn everything on your own, but studying these things helps prepare you for training. Workshops use computer-assisted design (CAD) programs to design blueprints. You can practice with free CAD programs at home or take classes to learn about it."
