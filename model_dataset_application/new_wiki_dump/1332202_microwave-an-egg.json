Microwave wattages will vary, so adjust these cooking times as needed based on your microwave's power. When the white is no longer runny, it is done cooking. This cooking temperature results in a medium-cooked. If you want the yolk to stay runny, cook the egg at 50 percent power for about 60 seconds.
