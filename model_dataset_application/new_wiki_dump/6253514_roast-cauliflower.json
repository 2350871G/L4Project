  "text":" Prepping Your Ingredients Purchase a medium head of cauliflower. Rinse it thoroughly under running water. Place a baking rack in the center of the oven. Preheat your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (218 Celsius). Pull the leaves off of the base of the cauliflower head. Cut off the bottom of the stem and discard it with the leaves. Cut the head into four quarters. Separate the quarter into florets by cutting along the base through the hard center. Florets look like little trees. Each quarter should yield between six and eight florets. It\u2019s best to do this with a knife, rather than your hands, because the flat surfaces will caramelize in the pan. Place the florets in a bowl.  Seasoning Cauliflower Drizzle your olive oil over the cauliflower.  Add your spices. Cauliflower can be seasoned with any number of spices, depending upon your tastes and the meal it is accompanying. Use salt and pepper for mild seasoning. You can also use these in addition to other spices. Mince two cloves of garlic and add a tsp. of lemon zest for a healthy, Italian flavor. Choose cumin or paprika to create a smoky flavor.

Toss the cauliflower with your hands to coat it uniformly with spices and oil.  Roasting Cauliflower Spray a baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray or brush with oil.  Pour the florets onto the sheet. Spread them into an even layer. Drizzle any oil or spice at the bottom of the bowl over the top of the cauliflower.  Place the tray into the oven.
