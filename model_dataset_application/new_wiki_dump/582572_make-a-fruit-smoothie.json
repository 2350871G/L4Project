If you don\u2019t add ice cubes to your smoothie, you can serve it over ice to make a chilled treat. If you don\u2019t have a blender, you can also use an immersion blender or food processor to make smoothies."

Cut the strawberries in half if they are larger than one inch (2.5 cm) in width. You can substitute any or all of the strawberries with other berries, such as blueberries, raspberries, or blackberries."

Popular non-dairy options include soy, rice, and almond milk."
