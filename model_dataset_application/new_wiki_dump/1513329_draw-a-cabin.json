  "text":" Steps Outline the shape of the cabin. Draw a slanted triangle for the roof. Draw a diamond shape for the wall and an arrow shape for the front of the cabin. Remember, your drawing should end up looking three-dimensional, so don't draw these initial shapes too flatly. Draw a rectangle for the chimney. It should be taller than the house itself, going all the way down the front with another parallel line to provide the right perspective. For the roof, follow the outline of the front of the cabin for reference. Be sure to extend one of the sides to make a cover. At this point your cabin should really be starting to take shape. Add details. Draw in the windows and the door. These can be wherever you like, but you can always just follow the example image for a solid guide. Add vertical rectangles for the pillars. Sketch in a floor/porch for the cabin, again adding extra lines to indicate depth. Draw the fence following the floor outline as reference. Try to make all the supporting posts about the same size, and the horizontal section as straight as possible. Color in your cabin. Use various shades of brown (since it's mostly made of wood and timber), although you can color the chimney grey or red to make it look like stone or brick. Alternate Method Draw a horizontal line. Draw an equilateral triangle over the right half of the line. Add a horizontal line to the left of the top of the triangle. Below each of the triangle's corners, draw a long skinny rectangle. Draw a line parallel to the right side of the triangle. Then, connect the horizontal lines at the top and bottom of the triangle. Finally, draw a horizontal line under the left rectangle from the previous step. Add a large rectangle between the two skinny ones. Connect the two skinny rectangles with a horizontal line. Then, add a small rectangle intersected by a cylinder. Begin detailing the texture of the cabin.  Finish detailing.  Erase guidelines.  Start coloring the drawing.  Enjoy your final image! ",
